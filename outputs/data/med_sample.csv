9905,A Digital Protein Microarray for COVID-19 Cytokine Storm Monitoring,"Despite widespread concern for cytokine storms leading to severe morbidity in COVID-19, rapid cytokine assays are not routinely available for monitoring critically ill patients. We report the clinical application of a machine learning-based digital protein microarray platform for rapid multiplex quantification of cytokines from critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the University of Michigan Hospital. The platform comprises two low-cost modules: (i) a semi-automated fluidic dispensing/mixing module that can be operated inside a biosafety cabinet to minimize the exposure of technician to the virus infection and (ii) a 12-12-15 inch compact fluorescence optical scanner for the potential near-bedside readout. The platform enabled daily cytokine analysis in clinical practice with high sensitivity (<0.4pg/mL), inter-assay repeatability ([~]10% CV), and near-real-time operation with a 10min assay incubation. A cytokine profiling test with the platform allowed us to observe clear interleukin -6 (IL-6) elevations after receiving tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor) while significant cytokine profile variability exists across all critically ill COVID-19 patients and to discover a weak correlation between IL-6 to clinical biomarkers, such as Ferritin and CRP. Our data revealed large subject-to-subject variability in a patients response to anti-inflammatory treatment for COVID-19, reaffirming the need for a personalized strategy guided by rapid cytokine assays.","Song, Y.; Ye, Y.; Su, S.-H.; Stephens, A.; Cai, T.; Chung, M.-T.; Han, M.; Newstead, M.

2760,Spatial Visualization of Cluster-Specific COVID-19 Transmission Network in South Korea During the Early Epidemic Phase,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been rapidly spreading throughout China and other countries including South Korea. As of March 12, 2020, a total number of 7,869 cases and 66 deaths had been documented in South Korea. Although the first confirmed case in South Korea was identified on January 20, 2020, the number of confirmed cases showed a rapid growth on February 19, 2020 with a total number of 1,261 cases with 12 deaths based on the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).

MethodUsing the data of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea that are publicly available from the KCDC, this paper aims to create spatial visualizations of COVID-19 transmission between January 20, 2020 and February 19, 2020.

ResultsUsing spatial visualization, this paper identified two early transmission clusters in South Korea (Daegu cluster and capital area cluster). Using a degree-weighted centrality measure, this paper proposes potential super-spreaders of the virus in the visualized clusters.

ConclusionCompared to various epidemiological measures such as the basic reproduction number, spatial visualizations of the cluster-specific transmission networks and the proposed centrality measure may be more useful to characterize super-spreaders and the spread of the virus especially in the early epidemic phase.","Park, J.

9227,"COVID 19 Pandemic: A Real-time Forecasts & Prediction of Confirmed Cases, Active Cases using the ARIMA model &Public Health in West Bengal, India.","BackgroundCOVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease which has been declared a Pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11 2020. This pandemic has spread over the world in more than 200 countries. India is also adversely affected by this pandemic, and there are no signs of slowing down of the virus in coming time. The absence of a vaccine for COVID-19 is making the situation worse for the already overstretched Indian public health care system. As economic burden makes it increasingly difficult for our country to continue imposing control measures, it is vital for states like West Bengal to make predictions using time series forecasting for the upcoming cases, test kits, health care and estimated the requirement of Quarantine centers, isolation beds, ICU beds and ventilators for COVID-19 patients.

ObjectiveThis study is forecasting the confirmed and active cases for COVID-19 until August, using time series ARIMA model & Public Health in West Bengal, India.

MethodsWe used ARIMA model, and Auto ARIMA model for forecasting confirmed and active cases till the end of August month using time series data of COVID-19 cases in West Bengal, India from March 1, 2020, to June 4, 2020.

ResultsWe are expecting that West Bengal will have around 62279 {+/-} 5000 Cases by the end of August based on our forecasts. Meanwhile Maharashtra, Punjab, Gujarat and Delhi (UT) will be the most affected states, having the highest number of active and confirmed cases at the end of August.

Discussion and ConclusionThis forecasts show a very crucial situation for West Bengal in coming days and, the actual numbers can go higher than our estimates of confirmed case as Lockdown 5.0 & Unlock 1.0 will be implemented from 1st June 2020 in India, West Bengal will be observing a partial lift of the lockdown and in that case, there will be a surge in the number of daily confirmed and active cases. The requirement of Health care sector needs to be further improved isolation beds, ICUs and ventilators will also be needed to increase in that scenario. Inter State & Intra State Movement restrictions are lifted. Hence, Migrants returning to their homes due to loss of livelihood and income in the lockdown period may lead to a rise in the number of cases, which could not be accounted for in our projections. We suggest more of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model in the health sector to accommodate COVID-19 patients adequately and reduce the burden of the already overstretched Indian public health care system, which will directly or indirectly affect the States in the time of crisis.","Sarkar, D.",2020-06-08,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.06.06.20124180,1,Dibash Sarkar,Adamas University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.06.20124180v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.06.20124180v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
9494,Disproportionate COVID-19 Related Mortality Amongst African Americans in Four Southern States in the United States,"BackgroundAfrican Americans have been severely affected by COVID-19 noted with the rising mortality rates within the African American community. Health disparities, health inequities and issues with systemic health access are some of the pre-existing issues African Americans were subjected to within the southern states in the United States. Second, social distancing is a critical non-pharmacological intervention to reduce the spread of COVID-19. However, social distancing was not practical and presented a challenge within the African American community, specifically, in the southern states.

ObjectiveThis article assesses the effect of COVID-19 on African Americans in the southern states.

MethodologyThis short communication queried the publicly available Department of Health statistics on COVID-19 related mortality and underlying health conditions in four southern states (Alabama [AL], Georgia [GA], Louisiana [LA] and Mississippi [MS]) with a high proportion of African American residents. Second, the unacast COVID-19 toolkit was used to derive a social distancing (SD) grade for any given state, based on three different metrics: (i) percent change in average distance travelled (ii) percent change in non-essential visits and (iii) decrease in human encounters (compared to national baseline).

ResultsAcross the four states, on average, as many as 54% of COVID-19 related deaths are in the African American community, although this minority group comprises only 32% of the population cumulatively. This article finds that all four southern states received a social distancing grade of F. COVID-19 have demonstrated that adverse outcomes are higher in individuals with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or pre-existing pulmonary compromise.

ConclusionThe COVID-19 pandemic has exposed racial disparities in our healthcare system that disproportionately impacts African Americans within the four states of the southern United States. In addition, the lack of diversity in the healthcare system likely impacts this disproportionate impact on African American communities because it is not able to address its primary obligations within minority communities. Recognizing that there is a great need for African American representation or diversity in the health workforce would be able to better address the health disparities.","Betson, D. N.; Maitra, D.

10461,Treatment of ARDS and hyperinflammation in COVID-19 with IL-6 antagonist Tocilizumab: a tertiary care experience from Pakistan,"Cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 is characterized by hyperinflammation which manifests as ARDS, multi-organ failure, and high inflammatory parameters. Tocilizumab, an IL-6 antagonist has been used in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with conflicting results from different parts of the world. We conducted a retrospective descriptive study from Feb 2020 to May 2020 on COVID-19 patients with ARDS and hyperinflammation characterized by raised CRP and/or ferritin. A total of 244 patients with COVID-19 were admitted out of which 107 had ARDS. Thirty patients had both ARDS and hyperinflammation and received tocilizumab. The mean age was 62.5 years (SD: 13.5) and the majority were male (83%). The mean CRP pre-treatment was 217.5 mg/L and post 48 to 72 hours of tocilizumab treatment was 98.5 mg/L. Twenty-one patients (70%) also received concomitant intravenous methylprednisolone. Of the 30 patients, 7 died and 20 recovered. Ten patients required intensive care unit admission and nine developed nosocomial infections. COVID-19 associated aspergillosis was diagnosed in three patients post tocilizumab treatment. Mortality was significantly higher in patients who developed a nosocomial infection and who required intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). Our study is the first to describe the treatment outcomes with tocilizumab from a low-middle income country. The availability and cost of tocilizumab in our region which makes it imperative to understand its potential for use in our setting. Our study supports the use of tocilizumab in a select patient population with COVID-19 and recommends monitoring of nosocomial infections and opportunistic infections.","Nasir, N.; Mahmood, S.

17617,"Association of COVID-19 RT-qPCR test false-negative rate with patient age, sex and time since diagnosis","BackgroundRoutine testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the community is essential for guiding key epidemiological decisions from the quarantine of individual patients to enrolling regional and national preventive measures. Yet, the primary testing tool, the RT-qPCR based testing, is notoriously known for its low sensitivity, i.e. high risk of missed detection of carriers. Quantifying the false-negative rate (FNR) of the RT-qPCR test at the community settings and its dependence on patient demographic and disease progression is therefore key in designing and refining strategies for disease spread prevention.

MethodsAnalyzing 843,917 test results of 521,696 patients, we identified false-negative (FN) and true-positive (TP) results as negative and positive results preceded by a COVID-19 diagnosis and followed by a later positive test. Regression analyses were used to determine associations of false-negative results with time of sampling after diagnosis, patient demographics and viral loads based on RT-qPCR Ct values of the next positive tests.

FindingsThe overall FNR was 22.8%, which is consistent with previous studies. Yet, this rate was much lower at the first 5 days following diagnosis (10.7%) and only increased in later dates. Furthermore, the FNR was strongly associated with demographics, with odds ratio of 1.74 (95% CI: 1.58-1.90) for women over men and 1.36 (95% CI: 1.34-1.39) for 10 years younger patients. Finally, FNR was associated with viral loads (p-value 0.0005), with a difference of 1.50 (95% CI: 0.70-2.30) between the average Ct of the N gene in a positive test following a false-negative compared to a positive test following a true-positive.

InterpretationOur results show that in the first few days following diagnosis, when results are critical for quarantine decisions, RT-qPCR testing is more reliable than previously reported. Yet the reliability of the test result is reduced in later days as well as for women and younger patients, where the viral loads are typically lower.

8376,A systematic review and meta-analysis of cancer patients affected by a novel coronavirus,"BackgroundCancer patients with COVID-19 disease have been reported to have double the case fatality rate of the general population.

Materials and methodsA systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, Google Scholar, and MedRxiv was done for studies on cancer patients with COVID-19. Pooled proportions were calculated for categorical variables.Odds ratio and forest plots were constructed for both primary and secondary outcomes. The random-effects model was used to account for heterogeneity between studies.

ResultsThis systematic review of 31 studies and meta-analysis of 181,323 patients from 26 studies involving 23,736 cancer patients is the largest meta-analysis to the best of our knowledge assessing outcomes in cancer patients affected by COVID-19. Our meta-analysis shows that cancer patients with COVID-19 have a higher likelihood of death (odds ratio, OR 2.54), which was largely driven by mortality among patients in China. Cancer patients were more likely to be intubated, although ICU admission rates were not statistically significant. Among cancer subtypes, the mortality was highest in hematological malignancies (OR 2.43) followed by lung cancer (OR 1.8). There was no association between receipt of a particular type of oncologic therapy and mortality. Our study showed that cancer patients affected by COVID-19 are a decade older than the normal population and have a higher proportion of co-morbidities. There was insufficient data to assess the association of COVID-directed therapy and survival outcomes in cancer patients. Despite the heterogeneity of studies and inconsistencies in reported variables and outcomes, these data could guide clinical practice and oncologic care during this unprecedented global health pandemic.

ConclusionCancer patients with COVID-19 disease are at increased risk of mortality and morbidity. A more nuanced understanding of the interaction between cancer-directed therapies and COVID-19-directed therapies is needed. This will require uniform prospective recording of data, possibly in multi-institutional registry databases.","Venkatesulu, B.

19947,Antigen-based rapid diagnostic testing or alternatives for diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19: A simulation-based net benefit analysis,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) can diagnose COVID-19 rapidly and at low cost, but their lower sensitivity than nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) has limited clinical adoption.

MethodsWe compared Ag-RDT, NAAT, and clinical judgment alone for diagnosing symptomatic COVID-19. We considered an outpatient setting (10% COVID-19 prevalence among the patients tested, 3-day NAAT turnaround) and a hospital setting (40% prevalence, 24-hour NAAT turnaround). We simulated transmission from cases and contacts and relationships between time, viral burden, transmission, and case detection. We compared diagnostic approaches using a measure of net benefit that incorporated both clinical and public health benefits and harms of intervention.

ResultsIn the outpatient setting, we estimated that using Ag-RDT instead of NAAT to test 200 individuals could have a net benefit equivalent to preventing all symptomatic transmission from one person with COVID-19 (one """"transmission-equivalent""""). In the hospital setting, net benefit analysis favored NAAT, and testing 25 patients with NAAT instead of Ag-RDT achieved one """"transmission-equivalent"""" of incremental benefit. In both settings, Ag-RDT was preferred to NAAT if NAAT turnaround time exceeded two days. Both Ag-RDT and NAAT provided greater net benefit than management based on clinical judgment alone, unless intervention carried minimal harm and was provided equally regardless of diagnostic approach.

ConclusionsFor diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19, the speed of diagnosis with Ag-RDT is likely to outweigh its lower accuracy compared to NAAT wherever NAAT turnaround times are two days or longer. This advantage may be even greater if Ag-RDTs are also less expensive.","Kendall, E. A.; Arinaminpathy, N.; Sacks, J. A.; Manabe, Y. C.; Dittrich, S.; Schumacher, S. G.; Dowdy, D.

18974,"Characteristics of COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Pune, India, and cost-effective predictors of intensive care treatment requirement","BackgroundMaharashtra is one of the worst affected states in this pandemic.2 As of 30th September, Maharashtra has in total 1.4 million cases with 38,000 deaths. Objective was to study associations of severity of disease and need for ICU treatment in COVID-19 patients.

MethodsA retrospective study of clinical course in 800 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and a predictive model of need for ICU treatment. Eight hundred consecutive patients admitted with confirmed COVID-19 disease.

ResultsAverage age was 41 years, 16% were <20 years of age, 55% were male, 50% were asymptomatic and 16% had at least one comorbidity. Using MoHFW India severity guidelines, 73% patients had mild, 6% moderate and 20% severe disease. Severity was associated with higher age, symptomatic presentation, elevated neutrophil and reduced lymphocyte counts and elevated inflammatory markers. Seventy-seven patients needed ICU treatment: they were older (56 years), more symptomatic and had lower SpO2 and abnormal chest X-ray and deranged hematology and biochemistry at admission. A model trained on the first 500 patients, using above variables predicted need for ICU treatment with sensitivity 80%, specificity 88% in subsequent 300 patients; exclusion of expensive laboratory tests did not affect accuracy.

ConclusionIn the early phase of COVID- 19 epidemic, a significant proportion of hospitalized patients were young and asymptomatic. Need for ICU treatment was predicted by simple measures including higher age, symptomatic onset, low SpO2 and abnormal chest X-ray. We propose a cost-effective model for referring patients for treatment at specialized COVID-19 hospitals.

These masks are normally intended for single use, but their sterilization and subsequent reuse could substantially mitigate a world-wide shortage.

DesignQuality assurance.

SettingA sealed environment chamber installed in the animal facility of an academic medical center.

InterventionsOne to five sterilization cycles using ionized hydrogen peroxide (iHP), generated by SteraMist(R) equipment (TOMI; Frederick, MD).

Main outcome measuresPersonal protective equipment, including five N95 mask models from three manufacturers, were evaluated for efficacy of sterilization following iHP treatment (measured with bacterial spores in standard biological indicator assemblies). Additionally, N95 masks were assessed for their ability to efficiently filter particles down to 0.3{micro}m and for their ability to form an airtight seal using a quantitative fit test. Filtration efficiency was measured using ambient particulate matter at a university lab and an aerosolized NaCl challenge at a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) pre-certification laboratory.

ResultsThe data demonstrate that N95 masks sterilized using SteraMist iHP technology retain function up to five cycles, the maximum number tested to date. Some but not all PPE could also be sterilized using an iHP environmental chamber, but pre-treatment with a handheld iHP generator was required for semi-enclosed surfaces such as respirator hoses.

ConclusionsA typical iHP environment chamber with a volume of ~80 m3 can treat ~7000 masks per day, as well as other items of PPE, making this an effective approach for a busy medical center.","Cramer, A.; Plana, D.; Yang, H.

This includes two doses of the mRNA platform vaccines (BNT162b2/Pfizer; mRNA-1273/Moderna) that are approved for use in the United States. In this brief report, we show that after a single dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, individuals that had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection had significantly higher antibody levels than individuals that had no history of infection. This provides the rationale for changing vaccination policy to deliver only a single dose to individuals with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection that may free up additional doses for individuals that have no preexisting immunity to the virus. Future study of other immune parameters such as T cell response and durability of immune response should be rapidly undertaken in individuals that had COVID-19 prior to vaccination.","Bradley, T.; Codiefy Study Team,  ; Grundberg, E.; Selvarangan, R.",2021-02-05,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.02.03.21251078,1,Todd Bradley,Children\'s Mercy Kansas City,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.03.21251078v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.03.21251078v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
3831,On predicting the novel COVID-19 human infections by using Infectious Disease modelling method in the Indian State of Tamil Nadu during 2020,"Since the introduction of the novel Corona Virus (The COVID-19) to the Chinese city Wuhan in the Hubei province during the late December 2019, the effectiveness of the deadly disease, its human infection, spreading severity and the mortality rate of the infection has been an issue of debate. The outbreak of the virus along the time has become a massive threat to the global public health security and has been declared as a pandemic. Accounting the radical number of increases in the infected cases and the death due to COVID-19 infections around the globe, there is a need to predict the infections among the people by making proper optimization and using various Infectious Disease modelling (IDM) methods, in order to challenge the outcome. In comparison with previous diseases like SARS and Ebola viruses, the new corona virus (COVID-19) infections are infectious during the incubation period. In addition to that, naturally produced droplets from humans (e.g. droplets produced by breathing, talking, sneezing, coughing) and Person-to-person contact transmission are reported to be the foremost ways of transmission of novel corona virus. By considering the above two factors, a modified SEIR (Susceptibility-Exposure-Infection-Recovery) method have been used for predicting the spread of the infections in the state of Tamil Nadu which is located in the southern part of India.

24616,"A rapid, cost efficient and simple method to identify current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern by Sanger sequencing part of the spike protein gene","In 2020, the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, caused a pandemic, which is still raging at the time of writing this. Many countries have set up high throughput RT-qPCR based diagnostics for people with COVID-19 symptoms and for the wider population. In addition, with the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) new lineages of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified that have been associated with increased transmissibility or altered vaccine efficacy, so-called Variants of Concern (VoC). WGS is generally too labor intensive and expensive to be applied to all positive samples from the diagnostic tests, and often has a turnaround time too long to enable VoC focused contact tracing. Here, we propose to use Sanger sequencing for the detection of common variants of concern and key mutations in early 2021, using a single set of the recognized ARTIC Network primers. The proposed setup relies entirely on materials and methods already in use in diagnostic RT-qPCR labs and on existing infrastructure from companies that have specialized in cheap and rapid turnaround Sanger sequencing. In addition, we provide an automated mutation calling software (https://github.com/kblin/covid-spike-classification). We have validated the setup on 195 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, and we were able to profile >85% of RT-qPCR positive samples, where the last 15% largely stem from samples with low viral count. At approximately 4{euro} per sample in material cost, with minimal hands-on time, little data handling, and a turnaround time of less than 30 hours, the setup is simple enough to be implemented in any SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR diagnostic lab. Our protocol provides results that can be used to focus contact-tracing efforts and it is cheap enough for the tracking and surveillance of all positive samples for emerging variants such as B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 as of January 2021.","Joergensen, T.

We developed a new framework that parameterizes disease transmission models with age-specific digital mobility data. By fitting the model to case data in Hong Kong, we were able to accurately track the local effective reproduction number of COVID-19 in near real time (i.e. no longer constrained by the delay of around 9 days between infection and reporting of cases) which is essential for quick assessment of the effectiveness of interventions on reducing transmissibility. Our findings showed that accurate nowcast and forecast of COVID-19 epidemics can be obtained by integrating valid digital proxies of physical mixing into conventional epidemic models.","Leung, K.; Wu, J.

27113,"Fast Evaluation of Viral Emerging Risks (FEVER): A computational tool for biosurveillance, diagnostics, and mutation typing of emerging viral pathogens","Viral pathogen can rapidly evolve, adapt to novel hosts and evade human immunity. The early detection of emerging viral pathogens through biosurveillance coupled with rapid and accurate diagnostics are required to mitigate global pandemics. However, RNA viruses can mutate rapidly, hampering biosurveillance and diagnostic efforts. Here, we present a novel computational approach called FEVER (Fast Evaluation of Viral Emerging Risks) to design assays that simultaneously accomplish: 1) broad-coverage biosurveillance of an entire class of viruses, 2) accurate diagnosis of an outbreak strain, and 3) mutation typing to detect variants of public health importance. We demonstrate the application of FEVER to generate assays to simultaneously 1) detect sarbecoviruses for biosurveillance; 2) diagnose infections specifically caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); and 3) perform rapid mutation typing of the D614G SARS-CoV-2 spike variant associated with increased pathogen transmissibility. These FEVER assays had a high in silico recall (predicted positive) up to 99.7% of 525,708 SARS-CoV-2 sequences analyzed and displayed sensitivities and specificities as high as 92.4% and 100% respectively when validated in 100 clinical samples. The D614G SARS-CoV-2 spike mutation PCR test was able to identify the single nucleotide identity at position 23,403 in the viral genome of 96.6% SARS-CoV-2 positive samples without the need for sequencing. This study demonstrates the utility of FEVER to design assays for biosurveillance, diagnostics, and mutation typing to rapidly detect, track, and mitigate future outbreaks and pandemics caused by emerging viruses.","Stromberg, Z.

7075,"Clinical Characteristics, Risk Factors and Outcomes Among the First Consecutive 1,096 Patients Diagnosed with COVID-19: The Kuwait Experience","BackgroundIn Kuwait, prior to the first case of COVID-19 being reported in the country, mass screening of incoming travelers from countries with known outbreaks was performed and resulted in the first identified cases in the country. All COVID-19 cases at the time and subsequently after, were transferred to a single center, Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital, where the patients received standardized investigations and treatments. The objective of this study was to characterize the demographics, clinical manifestations and outcomes in this unique patient population.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study was conducted between 24th February 2020 and 20th April 2020. All consecutive patients in the entire State of Kuwait diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO guidelines and admitted to Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital were recruited. Patients received standardized investigations and treatments. Multivariable analysis was used to determine the associations between risk factors and outcomes.

FindingsOf 1096 patients, the median age was 41 years and 81% of patients were male. Most patients were asymptomatic on admission (49.5%), 69.4% had no signs of infection and 94.6% were afebrile. Only 3.6% of patients required an ICU admission and 1.7% were dead at the studys cutoff date. On multivariate analysis, the risk factors found to be significantly associated with admission to intensive care were age above 50 years old, a qSOFA score above 0, smoking, elevated CRP and elevated procalcitonin levels. Asthma, smoking and elevated procalcitonin levels correlated significantly with mortality in our cohort.To our knowledge, this is the first large retrospective cohort study observing the characteristics of the initial consecutive COVID-19 patients of an entire country. Further, large proportion of asymptomatic patients provides novel insights into the clinical features of patients with milder disease.

7046,A collaborative online AI engine for CT-based COVID-19 diagnosis,"Artificial intelligence can potentially provide a substantial role in streamlining chest computed tomography (CT) diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. However, several critical hurdles have impeded the development of robust AI model, which include deficiency, isolation, and heterogeneity of CT data generated from diverse institutions. These bring about lack of generalization of AI model and therefore prevent it from applications in clinical practices. To overcome this, we proposed a federated learning-based Unified CT-COVID AI Diagnostic Initiative (UCADI, http://www.ai-ct-covid.team/), a decentralized architecture where the AI model is distributed to and executed at each host institution with the data sources or client ends for training and inferencing without sharing individual patient data. Specifically, we firstly developed an initial AI CT model based on data collected from three Tongji hospitals in Wuhan. After model evaluation, we found that the initial model can identify COVID from Tongji CT test data at near radiologist-level (97.5% sensitivity) but performed worse when it was tested on COVID cases from Wuhan Union Hospital (72% sensitivity), indicating a lack of model generalization. Next, we used the publicly available UCADI framework to build a federated model which integrated COVID CT cases from the Tongji hospitals and Wuhan Union hospital (WU) without transferring the WU data. The federated model not only performed similarly on Tongji test data but improved the detection sensitivity (98%) on WU test cases. The UCADI framework will allow participants worldwide to use and contribute to the model, to deliver a real-world, globally built and validated clinic CT-COVID AI tool. This effort directly supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals number 3, Good Health and Well-Being, and allows sharing and transferring of knowledge to fight this devastating disease around the world.","Xu, Y.; Ma, L.; Fan, Y.; Chen, Y.; Ma, K.; Yang, J.; Yang, X.; Chen, Y.; Shu, C.; Fan, Z.; Gan, J.; Zou, X.; Huang, R.; Zhang, C.; Liu, X.; Tu, D.; Xu, C.; Zhang, W.; Yang, D.; Wang, M.-W.; Wang, X.; Xie, X.; Leng, H.; Holalkere, N.; Halin, N.

24686,Psychological distress and resilience in a sample of Adolescents and Young Adults with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BACKGROUNDAdolescents and young people (AYA) with cancer are at greater risk of psychological distress which can impact treatment. COVID-19 has resulted in changes to cancer care delivery and AYA have been disproportionately affected by economic and educational effects of COVID-19, potentially impacting on mental health. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on AYA with cancer is important to inform care.

METHODSOnline survey of 16-24 year olds receiving cancer treatment at 8 cancer centres in the UK in December 2020. We measured: self-perceived increased anxiety since COVID-19, impact of COVID-19 on treatment, life and relationships and used the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire(PHQ-8), 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale(GAD) and the 2-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale(CD-RISC).

RESULTS112 AYA participated (17.8% of total eligible). 62.8% were female, 67.3% were 21-24 years. 83% were white. 59.8% had previously experienced mental health difficulties. 67.9% received cancer treatment during the pandemic and 33.9% were diagnosed during the pandemic. 78.6% reported COVID-19 having a significant impact on their life, 55.4% on their key relationship and 39.3% on their treatment. 79% reported experiencing some degree of increased anxiety since COVID-19.43.4% had moderate-severe PHQ-8 scores and 37.1% for GADS-7. Self-report of impact on life was associated with greater anxiety during COVID-19 and moderate-severe PHQ-8 score (OR 3.64, 95% CI 2.52 to 19.40, p <0.01; OR 5.23, 95%CI 1.65 to 16.56, p < 0.01). Impact on relationships was associated with greater anxiety and moderate-severe GADS-7and PHQ-8 score (OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.11 to 7.54, p = 0,03; OR 3.54, 95% CI 2.32 to 15.17, p<0.01; OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.11 to 5.25, p =0.03). Greater CD-RISC score was associated with lower risk of anxiety and mod-severe GADS-7and PHQ-8 scores (OR 0.58, 95%CI 0.41 to 0.81, p <0.01; OR 0.55 95% CI 0.4 to 0.72, p <0.01; OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.69, p <0.01)

CONCLUSIONSWe found high levels of psychological distress in AYA with cancer, which is important knowledge for clinical teams working with this age group. Perceived impact of COVID-19 on relationships and life was predictive of poorer mental health, with resilience a potential protective factor.","Jacobson, C.; Mulholland, R.; Miller, N.; Baker, L.; Glazer, D.; Betts, E.; Brown, L.; Elders, V.; Ogundiran, O.; Carr, R.; Hudson, L.

24826,"Increasing concentration of COVID-19 by socioeconomic determinants and geography in Toronto, Canada: an observational study","BackgroundInequities in the burden of COVID-19 observed across Canada suggest heterogeneity within community transmission.

ObjectivesTo quantify the magnitude of heterogeneity in the wider community (outside of long-term care homes) in Toronto, Canada and assess how the magnitude in concentration evolved over time (January 21 to November 21, 2020).

DesignRetrospective, population-based observational study using surveillance data from Ontarios Case and Contact Management system.

SettingToronto, Canada.

ParticipantsLaboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 (N=33,992).

MeasurementsWe generated epidemic curves by SDOH and crude Lorenz curves by neighbourhoods to visualize inequities in the distribution of COVID-19 cases by social determinants of health (SDOH) and estimated the crude Gini coefficient. We examined the correlation between SDOH using Pearson correlation coefficients.

ResultsThe Gini coefficient of cumulative cases by population size was 0.41 (95% CI: 0.36-0.47) and were estimated for: household income (0.20, 95%CI: 0.14-0.28); visible minority (0.21, 95%CI: 0.16-0.28); recent immigration (0.12, 95%CI: 0.09-0.16); suitable housing (0.21, 95%CI: 0.14-0.30); multi-generational households (0.19, 95%CI: 0.15-0.23); and essential workers (0.28, 95% CI: 0.23-0.34). Most SDOH were highly correlated.

Locally acquired cases were concentrated in higher income neighbourhoods in the early phase of the epidemic, and then concentrated in lower income neighbourhoods. Mirroring the trajectory of epidemic curves by income, the Lorenz curve shifted over time from below to above the line of equality with a similar pattern across SDOH.

LimitationsStudy relied on area-based measures of the SDOH and individual case counts of COVID-19. We cannot infer concentration of cases by specific occupational exposures given limitation to broad occupational categories.

ConclusionCOVID-19 is increasingly concentrated by SDOH given socioeconomic inequities and structural racism.

We find that the initial spread is characterized by a doubling time of about 5 days. We implement a model to forecast the future spread under different scenarios. The model predicts that, if significant containment measures are not taken, a large fraction of the population will be infected with COVID-19, with the peak of the epidemic expected at the end of May and intensive care units having largely exceeded capacity. We analyzed scenarios implementing strong containment measures, similar to those imposed in Europe. The model predicts that an immediate implementation of strong containment measures (on the 19th of April) will significantly reduce the death count. We assess the negative consequences of these measures being implemented with a delay, or not being sufficiently stringent.","Pigolotti, S.; Chiuchiu, D.; Villa Martin, P.; Bhat, D.",2020-04-22,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.20.20071977,1,Simone Pigolotti,Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.20071977v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.20071977v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
19963,"Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, risk factors for infection and associated symptoms in Geneva, Switzerland: a population-based study","BackgroundPopulation-based serological surveys provide a means for assessing the immunologic landscape of a community, without the biases related to health-seeking behaviors and testing practices typically associated with rt-PCR testing. This study assesses SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence over the first epidemic wave in Canton Geneva, Switzerland, as well as biological and socio-economic risk factors for infection and symptoms associated with IgG seropositivity.

Methods and findingsBetween April 6 and June 30, 2020, former participants of a yearly representative cross-sectional survey of the 20-75-year-old population of the canton of Geneva were invited to participate in a seroprevalence study, along with household members five years and older. We collected blood and tested it for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins G (IgG). Questionnaires were self-administered. We estimated seroprevalence with a Bayesian model accounting for test performance and sampling design. We included 8344 participants (53.5% women, mean age 46.9 years). The population-level seroprevalence over the 12-week study period was 7.8 % (95% Credible Interval (CrI) 6.8-8.9), accounting for sex, age and household random effects. Seroprevalence was highest among 18-49 year olds (9.5%, 95%CrI 8.1-10.9), with young children (5-9 years) and those >65 years having significantly lower seroprevalence (4.3% and 4.7-5.4% respectively). Men were more likely to be seropositive than women (relative risk 1.2, 95%CrI 1.1-1.4). Odds of seropositivity were reduced for female retirees (0.46, 95%CI 0.23-0.93) and unemployed men (0.35, 95%CI 0.13-1.0) compared to employed individuals, and for current smokers (0.36, 95%CI 0.23-0.55) compared to never-smokers. We found no significant association between occupation, level of education, neighborhood income and the risk of being seropositive. Symptoms most strongly associated with seropositivity were anosmia/dysgeusia, loss of appetite, fever, fatigue and myalgia and/or arthralgia. Thirteen percent of seropositive participants reported no symptoms.

ConclusionsOur results confirm a low population seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after the first wave in Geneva, a region hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Socioeconomic factors were not associated with seropositivity in this sample. The elderly and young children were less frequently seropositive, though it is not clear how biology and behaviors shape these differences. These specificities should be considered when assessing the need for targeted public health measures.","Richard, A.; Wisniak, A.; Perez-Saez, J.; Garrison-Desany, H.; Petrovic, D.; Piumatti, G.; Baysson, H.; Picazio, A.; Pennacchio, F.; De Ridder, D.; Chappuis, F.; Vuilleumier, N.; Low, N.; Hurst, S.; Eckerle, I.; Flahault, A.; Kaiser, L.; Azman, A.

5780,Impact of mitigating interventions and temperature on the instantaneous reproduction number in the COVID-19 epidemic among 30 US metropolitan areas,"BackgroundAfter more than four months into the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic, over 347,500 people had died worldwide. The current study aims to evaluate how mitigating interventions affected the epidemic process in the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the US and whether temperature played a role in the epidemic process.

MethodsPublicly available data for the time series of COVID-19 cases and deaths and weather were analyzed at the metropolitan level. The time-varying reproductive numbers (Rt) based on retrospective moving average were used to explore the trends. Student t tests were used to compare temperature and peak Rt cross-sectionally.

ResultsWe found that virus transmissibility, measured by instantaneous reproduction number (Rt), had declined since the end of March for all areas and almost all of them reached a Rt of 1 or below after April 15, 2020. However, the Rts remained around 1 for most areas since then and some small and short rebounds were presented in some areas, suggesting a persistent epidemic in those areas. The timing of the main decline was concurrent with the implementation of mitigating interventions. Cities with warm temperature also tended to have a lower peak Rt than that of cities with cold temperature. However, large geographic variations existed.

ConclusionsAggressive interventions might have mitigated the current epidemic of COVID-19, while temperature might have some weak effects on the virus transmission.

5735,"Estimates of the ongoing need for social distancing and control measures post-""""lockdown"""" from trajectories of COVID-19 cases and mortality.","By 29th April 2020, COVID-19 had caused more than 3 million cases across more than 200 countries. And most countries with significant outbreaks had introduced social distancing or """"lockdown"""" measures to reduce viral transmission. So the key question now is when, how, and to what extent, these measures can be lifted.

By fitting regression models to publically available data on daily numbers of newly-confirmed cases and mortality, trajectories, doubling times and reproduction number (R0) were estimated both before and under the control measures. These data ran up to 29th April 2020, and covered 73 countries that had provided sufficient data for modelling.

The estimates of R0, before lockdown, based on these data were broadly consistent with those previously published at between 2.0 and 3.7 in the countries with the largest number of cases available for analysis (USA, Italy, Spain, France and UK). There was little evidence to suggest that the restrictions had reduced R far below 1 in many places, with France having the most rapid reductions - R0 0.77 (95%CI 0.68-0.87), based on cases and 0.78 (95%CI 0.68-0.88) based on mortality.

Intermittent lockdown has been proposed as a means of controlling the outbreak while allowing periods of increase freedom and economic activity. These data suggest that few countries could have even one week per month unrestricted without seeing resurgence of the epidemic. Similarly, restoring 20% of the activity that has been prevented by the lockdowns looks difficult to reconcile with preventing the resurgence of the disease in most countries.","Lonergan, M.; Chalmers, J.",2020-05-05,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.26.20080994,2,Mike Lonergan,University of Dundee,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.20080994v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.20080994v2.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1183/13993003.01483-2020

We developed natural language processing (NLP) tools to transform the unstructured text of action-tracking reports to a structured network of social contacts. An epidemiology model was built on top of the network. Our analysis provides important insights for the development of control policies. Under the """"new normal"""" conditions, we find that restaurants, locations less protected by mask-wearing, have a greater risk than any other location categories, including locations where people are present at higher densities (e.g., flight). We find that discouraging railway transports is crucial to avoid another wave of breakout during the Chunyun season (a period of travel in China with extremely high traffic load around the Chinese New Year). By formalizing the challenge of finding the optimal vaccine delivery among various different population groups as an optimization problem, our analysis helps to maximize the efficiency of vaccine delivery under the general situation of vaccine supply shortage. We are able to reduce the numbers of infections and deaths by 7.4% and 10.5% respectively with vaccine supply for only 1% of the population. Furthermore, with 10% vaccination rate, the numbers of infections and deaths further decrease by 52.6% and 78.1% respectively. Our work will be helpful in the design of effective policies regarding interventions, reopening, contact tracing and vaccine delivery in the """"new normal"""" world following COVID-19 spread.","Sun, X.; Guan, T.; Xue, T.; Fan, C.; Yang, M.; Meng, Y.; Zhang, T.; Jiangtulu, B.; Wu, F.; Li, J.",2021-04-25,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.04.08.21254953,3,Jiwei Li,"Department of Computer Science, Zhejiang University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.08.21254953v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.08.21254953v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
15399,Investigating the implications of COVID-19 for the rural and remote population of Northern Ontario using a mathematical model,"BackgroundCOVID-19 has the potential to disproportionately affect the rural, remote, and Indigenous populations who typically have a worse health status and live in substandard housing, often with overcrowding. Our aim is to investigate the potential effect of COVID-19 on intensive care unit (ICU) resources and mortality in northwestern Ontario.

MethodsThis study was conducted in northwestern Ontario which has a population of 230,000. A set of differential equations were used to represent a modified Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model with urban and rural hospital resources (i.e., ICU and hospital beds). Rural patients requiring ICU care flowed into the urban ICU. Sensitivity analyses were used to investigate the effect of poorer health status (i.e., increased hospital admission, ICU admission, and mortality) and overcrowding (i.e., increased contact rate) in the rural population as compared to the urban population. Physical distancing within the urban population was modelled as a decreased contact rate.

ResultsAt the highest contact rate, the peak in daily active cases, ICU bed requirements and mortality was higher and occurred earlier than lower contact rates. The urban population with a lower contact rate and baseline health status had a lower predicted prevalence of active cases and lower mortality than the rural population.

InterpretationAn increased contact rate and worse health status in the rural population will likely increase the required ICU resources and mortality as compared to the urban population. Rural populations will likely be affected disproportionately more than urban populations.","Savage, D.; Fisher, A.; Choudhury, S.; Ohle, R.; Strasser, R.; Orkin, A.; Mago, V.",2020-09-18,Health Systems And Quality Improvement,10.1101/2020.09.17.20196949,1,David Savage,Northern Ontario School of Medicine,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.17.20196949v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.17.20196949v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,"NA"
27675,Antibody Responses after SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in Lymphoma,"Individuals with lymphoid malignancies have an increased mortality risk from COVID-19. Paradoxically, this population is least likely to be protected by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination as a result of disease- or treatment-related immunosuppression. Current data on vaccine responses in persons with lymphoid malignancies is limited.

PROSECO is a UK multi-centre prospective observational study evaluating COVID-19 vaccine immune responses in individuals with lymphoma. This early interim analysis details the antibody responses to first- and second-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with either BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca), in 129 participants. Responses are compared to those obtained in healthy volunteers.

The key findings of this interim analysis are first, 61% of participants who are vaccinated during or within 6 months of receiving systemic anti-lymphoma treatment, do not have detectable antibodies despite two doses of vaccine. Second, individuals with curable disease such has Hodgkin (6/6) and aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (13/16) develop robust antibody levels to either first or second doses, when vaccinated > 6 months after treatment completion. Third, participants incurable, indolent lymphomas have reduced antibody levels to first and second vaccine doses, irrespective of treatment history. Finally, whilst there was no difference in antibody responses between BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 in lymphoma participants, BNT162b2 induces 11-fold higher antibody responses than ChAdOx1 after the second dose in healthy donors.

These findings serve to reassure the community that individuals with treated Hodgkin and aggressive B-NHL can develop antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Simultaneously it also highlights the critical need to identify an alternative strategy against COVID-19 for those undergoing systemic anti-lymphoma treatment, and for individuals with indolent lymphomas.","Lim, S.

20893,Deep RNA Sequencing of Intensive Care Unit Patients with COVID-19,"PurposeCOVID-19 has impacted millions of patients across the world. Molecular testing occurring now identifies the presence of the virus at the sampling site: nasopharynx, nares, or oral cavity. RNA sequencing has the potential to establish both the presence of the virus and define the hosts response in COVID-19.

MethodsSingle center, prospective study of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit where deep RNA sequencing (>100 million reads) of peripheral blood with computational biology analysis was done. All patients had positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. Clinical data was prospectively collected.

ResultsWe enrolled fifteen patients at a single hospital. Patients were critically ill with a mortality of 47% and 67% were on a ventilator. All the patients had the SARS-CoV-2 RNA identified in the blood in addition to RNA from other viruses, bacteria, and archaea. The expression of many immune modulating genes, including PD-L1 and PD-L2, were significantly different in patients who died from COVID-19. Some proteins were influenced by alternative transcription and splicing events, as seen in HLA-C, HLA-E, NRP1 and NRP2. Entropy calculated from alternative RNA splicing and transcription start/end predicted mortality in these patients.

ConclusionsCurrent upper respiratory tract testing for COVID-19 only determines if the virus is present. Deep RNA sequencing with appropriate computational biology may provide important prognostic information and point to therapeutic foci to be precisely targeted in future studies.

Take Home MessageDeep RNA sequencing provides a novel diagnostic tool for critically ill patients. Among ICU patients with COVID-19, RNA sequencings can identify gene expression, pathogens (including SARS-CoV-2), and can predict mortality.

25928,Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection over six months among Nicaraguan outpatients,"New information is emerging about SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology and immunity, but little of this information comes from low- and middle-income countries or from patients receiving care in the outpatient setting. The current study investigated the SARS-CoV-2 infection status and antibody responses in 157 patients seeking care for a respiratory disease suggestive of COVID-19 in private healthcare clinics during the first wave (June-October 2020) of infections in Nicaragua. We examined nasal swabs for the presence of viral RNA via RT-PCR and longitudinally collected sera for the changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibody levels over six months. Among patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, we evaluated if clinical symptoms were associated with age, hematological parameters and co-morbidities. The combination of PCR and paired serology identified 60 (38%) of the 157 outpatients as acute COVID-19. While both PCR and serology identified the majority (n = 38, 64%) of the acute infections, a notable number of outpatients were identified by RT-qPCR (n = 13, 22%) or by serology (n = 9, 14%) only. During the longitudinal study, we identified 6 new infections by serology among the 97 non-COVID-19 subjects. In conclusion, this study report that more than one third of the outpatients seeking care for acute respiratory disease during the first epidemic wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Nicaragua had an acute mild COVID-19 infection that correlate with prolonged humoral response. This immune response to the RBD antigen, more likely IgG dependent, significantly increased between the acute to convalescent and decay in the late convalescent but still remained seropositive.","Bucardo, F.; Gonzalez, F.; Zepeda, O.; Toval Ruiz, C.

19714,Changes in cardiovascular disease monitoring in English primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic: an observational cohort study,"ObjectiveTo quantify the impact and recovery in cardiovascular disease monitoring in primary care associated with the first COVID-19 lockdown.

DesignRetrospective nationwide primary care cohort study, utilising data from 1st January 2018 to 27th September 2020.

SettingWe extracted primary care electronic health records data from 514 primary care practices in England contributing to the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners Clinical Informatics Digital Hub (ORCHID). These practices were representative of English primary care across urban and non-urban practices.

ParticipantsThe ORCHID database included 6,157,327 active patients during the study period, and 13,938,390 patient years of observation (final date of follow-up 27th September 2020). The mean (SD) age was 38{+/-}24 years, 49.4% were male and the majority were of white ethnicity (65% [21.9% had unknown ethnicity])

ExposureThe primary exposure was the first national lockdown in the UK, starting on 23rd March 2020.

Main outcome measuresRecords of cholesterol, blood pressure, HbA1c and International Normalised Ratio (INR) measurement derived from coded entries in the primary care electronic health record.

ResultsRates of cholesterol, blood pressure, HbA1c and INR recording dropped by 23-87% in the week following the first UK national lockdown, compared with the previous week. The largest decline was seen in cholesterol (IRR 0.13, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.15) and smallest for INR (IRR 0.77, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.81).

Following the immediate drop, rates of recorded tests increased on average by 5-9% per week until 27th September 2020. However, the number of recorded measures remained below that expected for the time of year, reaching 51.8% (95% CI 51.8 to 51.9%) for blood pressure, 63.7%, (95% CI 63.7% to 63.8%) for cholesterol measurement and 70.3% (95% CI 70.2% to 70.4%) for HbA1c. Rates of INR recording declined throughout the previous two years, a trend that continued after lockdown. There were no differences in the times series trends based on sex, age, ethnicity or deprivation.

ConclusionsCardiovascular disease monitoring in English primary care declined substantially from the time of the first UK lockdown. Despite a consistent recovery in activity, there is still a substantial shortfall in the numbers of recorded measurements to those expected. Strategies are required to ensure cardiovascular disease monitoring is maintained during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bankhead, C. R.; Lay-Flurrie, S.; Nicholson, B. D.; Sheppard, J. P.; Gale, C.

DesignRetrospective cohort study

SettingTelemedicine clinic at a large medical system in Atlanta, Georgia

Participants273 patients with COVID-19. Exclusion criteria included: (1) intake more than 10 days after symptom onset, (2) hospitalization for covid-19, (3) symptoms at less than two visits.

Main outcome measuresSymptom duration in days

ResultsCommon symptoms at diagnosis are upper respiratory (64% cough, 53% loss of smell or taste, 50% sinus congestion, 22% sore throat), systemic (50% headache, 48% body aches, 36% chills, 22% dizziness, 18% fever). The most frequent remaining symptoms at 30 days were cough (7%), loss of smell or taste (5%), body aches (5%), nasal congestion (5%), shortness of breath with exertion (5%), and joint pain (5%). Day of symptom onset was earliest for upper respiratory symptoms (mean 1.26 days, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.4), followed by systemic symptoms (1.54, 1.39 to 1.7), with later onset of lower respiratory (2.86, 2.54 to 3.22) and gastrointestinal symptoms (3.46, 3.07 to 3.89), when present. Cough had the longest duration when present with 12.2 days (10.9 to 13.6). Loss of smell or taste had the second longest duration with 11.0 days (9.9 to 12.2). Provider-Assessed Symptom Severity (PASS) is the best predictor of symptom duration (P <0.005 for multiple symptoms) and patients with """"Moderate"""" PASS compared to """"Mild"""" at their intake visit have higher rates of symptoms at 30 days, including cough (12%), nasal congestion (10%), joint pain (10%), body aches (9%), loss of taste or smell (7%), headache (7%), and shortness of breath with exertion (6%).

ConclusionsCovid-19 illness in outpatients follows a pattern of progression from systemic symptoms to lower respiratory symptoms and persistent symptoms are common across categories.

17618,Analytical and Clinical Performance of the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen-Detecting Rapid Diagnostic Test,"BackgroundThe current standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, RT-qPCR, has important drawbacks for its use as a tool for epidemiological control, including the need of laboratory-processing, high cost, and long turnaround from sampling to results release. Antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) provide a promising alternative for this purpose.

MethodsWe assessed the analytical and clinical performance of the Ag-RDT Panbio COVID-19 Ag Test (Abbott), using RT-qPCR as a reference test. The clinical performance was assessed using nasopharyngeal swabs, collected in routine practice for case confirmation and contact tracing, and nasal mid-turbinate swabs, collected in preventive screenings of asymptomatic individuals. Fresh samples were analysed by RT-q-PCR, stored at -80 {degrees}C, and analysed using the Ag-RDT according to the manufacturer instructions.

FindingsThe Ag-RDT had a limit of detection of 6{middle dot}5x105 copies/reaction. The clinical performance was assessed on 1,406 frozen swabs with a PCR result available: 951 (67{middle dot}7%) positive and 455 (32{middle dot}4%) negative. The Ag-RDT identified the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in 872 of 951 PCR-positive samples (91{middle dot}7%; 95% CI 89{middle dot}8-93{middle dot}4 and ruled out its presence in 450 of 455 PCR-negative samples (specificity 98{middle dot}9%; 95% CI 97{middle dot}5- 99{middle dot}6). Sensitivity increased in samples with lower Ct values (Ct <25, 98{middle dot}2%; Ct<30, 94{middle dot}9%) and was higher among symptomatic cases (92{middle dot}6%) and their contacts (94{middle dot}2%) than among asymptomatic individuals (79{middle dot}5%). In the setting of asymptomatic screening, sensitivity also increased with lower Ct values (Ct <25, 100%; Ct<30, 98{middle dot}6%). Assuming a pre-test probability of 5%, the negative and positive predictive values were 99{middle dot}6% (99{middle dot}5 - 99{middle dot}6) and 81{middle dot}5% (65{middle dot}0 - 93{middle dot}2), respectively.

InterpretationThe Panbio COVID-19 Ag-RDT has high sensitivity for detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs of both, symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The diagnostic performance of the test is particularly good in samples with viral loads associated with high risk of viral transmission (Ct <25), which show high positive and negative predictive values even when assuming a prevalence as low as 5%.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSOn October 6, 2020, we searched PubMed for articles containing """"Antigen"""", """"test"""", """"SARS-CoV-2"""", """"COVID-19"""" and """"performance"""" in either the title or the abstract. We found five studies that showed the accuracy of point-of-care tests in identifying SARS-CoV-2 antigens for confirmation of clinically suspected COVID-19. We found high variability in the diagnostic accuracy of Ag-RDT. Most tests showed high specificity (i.e., 99% or higher), whereas sensitivity ranged from 11% to 92%; only one test reported sensitivity higher than 60%. We found no studies investigating the diagnostic accuracy of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Test. We found no studies that assessed the performance of Ag-RDT for population-level screening of asymptomatic individuals.

Added value of this studyOur analysis provides information regarding the diagnostic accuracy of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Test when tested on 1,406 frozen samples of nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs collected in routine practice for diagnostic confirmation of symptomatic individuals with suspected COVID-19 or contacts exposed to a positive case, and preventive screenings of unexposed asymptomatic individuals. Compared with RT-qPCR as reference test, the Ag-RDT showed a sensitivity and specificity of 91{middle dot}7% and 98{middle dot}9%. Test sensitivity increased in samples with viral load associated with high risk of transmission (Ct <25), reaching more than 98%, regardless of the presence of symptoms.

Implications of all the available evidenceAvailable evidence show variability in the diagnostic performance of marketed Ag-RDT. Our results provide substantial evidence that the point-of-care Panbio COVID-19 Ag Test can accurately identify SARS-CoV-2 antigens in people with suspected clinical COVID-19 as well as in asymptomatic people with high viral load and therefore, associated with higher risk of transmission. This finding represents a potentially useful advance for mass screening of asymptomatic people at the point-of-care.","Mitja, O.",2020-11-03,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.30.20223198,1,Oriol Mitja,Fundacio Lluita contra la Sida,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.20223198v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.20223198v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.12.033

16058,SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in patients with aggressive haematological malignancies,"The development of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 is an indicator of seroprevalence and may afford protection from infection. It has been presumed that antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 will be impaired in patients with aggressive haematological malignancy (PHM) due to underlying immunological dysfunction caused by malignancy or systemic anti-cancer treatment (SACT), placing them at increased risk. Here we analysed longitudinal serum samples from ten hospitalised PHM with aggressive disease and on SACT, collected up to 103 days post-onset of COVID-19 symptoms. We found that the majority (8/9) of PHM with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection seroconverted and developed antibodies to the major SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S1 and N) with most (6/8) produced neutralising antibody responses. Furthermore, the dynamics of antibody responses were broadly similar to that reported for the general population, except for a possible delay to seroconversion. Our finding that PHM on SACT can make functional antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 has important implications for patient management and serological monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in high-risk groups.","O'nions, J.; Muir, L.; Zheng, J.; Rees-Spear, C.; Rosa, A.; Earl, C.; Cherepanov, P.; Gupta, R.; Khwaja, A.; Jolly, C.; Mccoy, L.

28316,Resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 in India: Potential role of the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant and delayed interventions,"India has seen a surge of SARS-CoV-2 infections and deaths in early part of 2021, despite having controlled the epidemic during 2020. Building on a two-strain, semi-mechanistic model that synthesizes mortality and genomic data, we find evidence that altered epidemiological properties of B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant play an important role in this resurgence in India. Under all scenarios of immune evasion, we find an increased transmissibility advantage for B.1617.2 against all previously circulating strains. Using an extended SIR model accounting for reinfections and wanning immunity, we produce evidence in support of how early public interventions in March 2021 would have helped to control transmission in the country. We argue that enhanced genomic surveillance along with constant assessment of risk associated with increased transmission is critical for pandemic responsiveness.

20221,Low vitamin K status predicts mortality in a cohort of 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19,"It has recently been hypothesised that Vitamin K could play a role in COVID-19. We aimed to test the hypothesis that low vitamin K status is a common characteristic of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to population controls; and that low vitamin K status predicts mortality in COVID-19 patients. In a cohort of 138 COVID-19 patients and 140 population controls, we measured plasma dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated Matrix Gla Protein (dp-ucMGP), which reflects the functional Vitamin K status in peripheral tissue. Fourty-three patients died within 90-days from admission. In patients, levels of dp-ucMGP differed significantly between survivors (mean 877; 95% CI: 778; 995) and non-survivors (mean 1445; 95% CI: 1148; 1820). Furthermore, levels of dp-ucMGP (pmol/L) were considerably higher in patients (mean 1022; 95% CI: 912; 1151) compared to controls (mean 509; 95% CI: 485; 540). Cox regression survival analysis showed that increasing levels of dp-ucMGP (reflecting low Vitamin K status) were associated with higher mortality risk (sex- and age-adjusted hazard ratio per doubling of dp-ucMGP was 1.50, 95% CI: 1.03; 2.18). In conclusion, we found that low Vitamin K status predicted mortality in patients with COVID-19 supporting a potential role of Vitamin K in COVID-19.","Linneberg, A.; Kampmann, F. B.; Israelsen, S.

9869,Innate immune signaling in the olfactory epithelium reduces odorant receptor levels: modeling transient smell loss in COVID-19 patients,"Post-infectious anosmias typically follow death of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) with a months-long recovery phase associated with parosmias. While profound anosmia is the leading symptom associated with COVID-19 infection, many patients regain olfactory function within days to weeks without distortions. Here, we demonstrate that sterile induction of anti-viral type I interferon signaling in the mouse olfactory epithelium is associated with diminished odor discrimination and reduced odor-evoked local field potentials. RNA levels of all class I, class II, and TAAR odorant receptors are markedly reduced in OSNs in a non-cell autonomous manner. We find that people infected with COVID-19 rate odors with lower intensities and have odor discrimination deficits relative to people that tested negative for COVID-19. Taken together, we propose that inflammatory-mediated loss of odorant receptor expression with preserved circuit integrity accounts for the profound anosmia and rapid recovery of olfactory function without parosmias caused by COVID-19.","Rodriguez, S.; Cao, L.; Rickenbacher, G.

12942,Viable SARS-CoV-2 in the air of a hospital room with COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundThere currently is substantial controversy about the role played by SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols in disease transmission, due in part to detections of viral RNA but failures to isolate viable virus from clinically generated aerosols.

MethodsAir samples were collected in the room of two COVID-19 patients, one of whom had an active respiratory infection with a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. By using VIVAS air samplers that operate on a gentle water-vapor condensation principle, material was collected from room air and subjected to RT-qPCR and virus culture. The genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 collected from the air and of virus isolated in cell culture from air sampling and from a NP swab from a newly admitted patient in the room were sequenced.

FindingsViable virus was isolated from air samples collected 2 to 4.8m away from the patients. The genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from the material collected by the air samplers was identical to that isolated from the NP swab from the patient with an active infection. Estimates of viable viral concentrations ranged from 6 to 74 TCID50 units/L of air.

InterpretationPatients with respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 produce aerosols in the absence of aerosol-generating procedures that contain viable SARS-CoV-2, and these aerosols may serve as a source of transmission of the virus.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSVarious studies report detection of SARS-CoV-2 in material collected by air samplers positioned in clinics and in some public spaces. For those studies, detection of SARS-CoV-2 has been by indirect means; instead of virus isolation, the presence of the virus in material collected by air samplers has been through RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. However, questions have been raised about the clinical significance of detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, particularly as airborne viruses are often inactivated by exposure to UV light, drying, and other environmental conditions, and inactivated SARS-CoV-2 cannot cause COVID-19.

Added value of this studyOur virus isolation work provides direct evidence that SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols can be viable and thus pose a risk for transmission of the virus. Furthermore, we show a clear progression of virus-induced cytopathic effects in cell culture, and demonstrate that the recovered virus can be serially propagated. Moreover, we demonstrate an essential link: the viruses we isolated in material collected in four air sampling runs and the virus in a newly admitted symptomatic patient in the room were identical. These findings strengthen the notion that airborne transmission of viable SARS-CoV-2 is likely and plays a critical role in the spread of COVID-19.

Implications of all the available evidenceScientific information on the mode of transmission should guide best practices Current best practices for limiting the spread of COVID-19. Transmission secondary to aerosols, without the need for an aerosol-generating procedure, especially in closed spaces and gatherings, has been epidemiologically linked to exposures and outbreaks. For aerosol-based transmission, measures such as physical distancing by 6 feet would not be helpful in an indoor setting and would provide a false-sense of security. With the current surges of cases, to help stem the COVID-19 pandemic, clear guidance on control measures against SARS-CoV-2 aerosols are needed.","Lednicky, J. A.; Lauzardo, M.; Fan, Z. H.; Jutla, A.

27995,Estimating Vaccination Effects on COVID-19 outbreak course in Japan,"BackgroundJapan started vaccinations for COVID-19 in late February, 2021, mainly using BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine.

ObjectWe evaluated COVID-19 vaccination effects on infectiousness in Japan. Method: The effective reproduction number R(t) was regressed on vaccine coverage along with data of temperature, humidity, mobility, and countermeasures. We presumed two definitions for vaccine coverage: at least a single dose with a 12-day delay and a second dose. The study period was February, 2020 through May 16, 2021.

ResultsEstimation results indicate that vaccine coverage significantly and drastically reduced R(t) for both definitions. Results imply that increased first shot coverage by 1% point decreased R(t) by 0.5 with a 12 day delay. Moreover, increased second shot coverage by 1% point, decreased R(t) by 1 immediately.

Discussion and ConclusionVaccination effects might be stronger because the periods when vaccination was started and rapid spread coincide with a decreasing phase of R(t).","Kurita, J.; Sugawara, T.; Ohkusa, Y.",2021-06-22,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.06.20.21259209,1,Junko Kurita,"Tokiwa University, Ibaraki, Japan",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.20.21259209v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.20.21259209v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
5640,Estimating COVID-19 Prevalence in the United States: A Sample Selection Model Approach,"BackgroundPublic health efforts to determine population infection rates from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been hampered by limitations in testing capabilities and the large shares of mild and asymptomatic cases. We developed a methodology that corrects observed positive test rates for non-random sampling to estimate population infection rates across U.S. states from March 31 to April 7.

MethodsWe adapted a sample selection model that corrects for non-random testing to estimate population infection rates. The methodology compares how the observed positive case rate vary with changes in the size of the tested population, and applies this gradient to infer total population infection rates. Model identification requires that variation in testing rates be uncorrelated with changes in underlying disease prevalence. To this end, we relied on data on day-to-day changes in completed tests across U.S. states for the period March 31 to April 7, which were primarily influenced by immediate supply-side constraints. We used this methodology to construct predicted infection rates across each state over the sample period. We also assessed the sensitivity of the results to controls for state-specific daily trends in infection rates.

ResultsThe median population infection rate over the period March 31 to April 7 was 0.9% (IQR 0.64 1.77). The three states with the highest prevalence over the sample period were New York (8.5%), New Jersey (7.6%), and Louisiana (6.7%). Estimates from mod-els that control for state-specific daily trends in infection rates were virtually identical to the baseline findings. The estimates imply a nationwide average of 12 population infections per diagnosed case. We found a negative bivariate relationship (corr. = -0.51) between total per capita state testing and the ratio of population infections per diagnosed case.

InterpretationThe effectiveness of the public health response to the coronavirus pandemic will depend on timely information on infection rates across different regions. With increasingly available high frequency data on COVID-19 testing, our methodology could be used to estimate population infection rates for a range of countries and subnational districts. In the United States, we found widespread undiagnosed COVID-19 infection. Expansion of rapid diagnostic and serological testing will be critical in preventing recurrent unobserved community transmission and identifying the large numbers individuals who may have some level of viral immunity.

14280,Clinical Feasibility and Preliminary Outcomes of a Novel Mixed Reality Based System to Manage Phantom Pain for Patients with Lower Limb Amputation.: A Pilot Study,"ObjectiveThis report describes the details of Mr. MAPP, a virtual mirror therapy system and the results of a clinical feasibility and evaluation study of a pilot sample of patients with history of lower limb amputation and phantom limb pain.

Materials and MethodsMr. MAPP system uses a Kinect V2 RGB-D camera to capture the patient, generates a live interactive 3D model, and incorporates it into a virtual exergame. Mr. MAPP mirrors their preserved limb and allows participants to visualize their amputated limb virtually and perform their prescribed exercise program. Mr. MAPP creates a digital diary of their therapy sessions by recording game performance and errors. Ten consecutive patients with history of limb loss and phantom pain were targeted for this pilot study. They received a Mr. MAPP system and a laptop for home use for 1-month. Outcome measures including pain intensity and pain interference measured on Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) as well as functional outcomes measured on Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) were obtained at baseline, and after 1-month.

ResultsSeven participants were enrolled, out of which four completed the study. The study was temporarily suspended due to restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 public health emergency. In-game performance data showed a trend towards improvement in most participants. Compared to baseline, NRS and MPQ scores at 1-month showed no clear trends. PSFS scores improved for 1 participant and remained unchanged for others.

ConclusionGamified home exercises performed via a novel, mixed-reality system--Mr. MAPP-- using which virtual mirror therapy was delivered, is feasible and has potential to improve pain and pain related function in patients with lower limb amputations and phantom limb pain.","Annaswamy, T.

2339,The effect of human mobility and control measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in China,"The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has expanded rapidly throughout China. Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China have substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.","Kraemer, M. U.

7430,Simulating SARS-CoV-2 epidemics by region-specific variables and modeling contact tracing App containment,"Targeted contact-tracing through mobile phone apps has been proposed as an instrument to help contain the spread of COVID-19 and manage the lifting of nation-wide lockdowns currently in place in USA and Europe. However, there is an ongoing debate on its potential efficacy, especially in the light of region-specific demographics.

We built an expanded SIR model of COVID-19 epidemics that accounts for region-specific population densities, and we used it to test the impact of a contact-tracing app in a number of scenarios. Using demographic and mobility data from Italy and Spain, we used the model to simulate scenarios that vary in baseline contact rates, population densities and fraction of app users in the population.

Our results show that, in support of efficient isolation of symptomatic cases, app-mediated contact-tracing can successfully mitigate the epidemic even with a relatively small fraction of users, and even suppress altogether with a larger fraction of users. However, when regional differences in population density are taken into consideration, the epidemic can be significantly harder to contain in higher density areas, highlighting potential limitations of this intervention in specific contexts.

This work corroborates previous results in favor of app-mediated contact-tracing as mitigation measure for COVID-19, and draws attention on the importance of region-specific demographic and mobility factors to achieve maximum efficacy in containment policies.","Ferrari, A.; Santus, E.; Cirillo, D.; Ponce-De-Leon, M.; Marino, N.; Ferretti, M.

21595,The impact of social restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical activity levels of older adults: a baseline analysis of the CHARIOT COVID-19 Rapid Response prospective cohort study,"ObjectivesPhysical inactivity is more common in older adults, is associated with social isolation and loneliness, and contributes to increased morbidity and mortality. We examined the effect of social restrictions, implemented to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in the UK (lockdown), on physical activity (PA) levels of older adults, and the demographic, lifestyle and social predictors of this change.

DesignBaseline analysis of a survey-based prospective cohort study

SettingAdults enrolled in the Cognitive Health in Ageing Register for Investigational and Observational Trials (CHARIOT) cohort from GP practices in North West London were invited to participate from April to July 2020.

Participants6,219 cognitively healthy adults aged 50 to 92 years completed the survey.

Main outcome measuresSelf-reported PA before and after lockdown, as measured by Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) minutes. Associations of PA with demographic, lifestyle and social factors, mood and frailty.

ResultsMean PA was significantly lower following lockdown, from 3,519 MET minutes/week to 3,185 MET minutes/week (p<0.001). After adjustment for confounders and pre-lockdown PA, lower levels of PA after lockdown were found in those who were over 85 years old (640 [95% CI: 246 to 1034] MET minutes/week less); were divorced or single (240 [95% CI: 120 to 360] MET minutes/week less); living alone (277 [95% CI: 152 to 402] MET minutes/week less); reported feeling lonely often (306 [95% CI: 60 to 552] MET minutes/week less); and showed symptoms of depression (1007 [95% CI: 1401 to 612] MET minutes/week less) compared to those aged 50-64 years, married, co-habiting, and not reporting loneliness or depression, respectively.

Conclusions and ImplicationsMarkers of social isolation, loneliness and depression were associated with lower PA following lockdown in the UK. Interventions to improve PA in older adults should take account of social and community factors, and targeted strategies to increase physical activity in socially isolated, lonely and depressed older adults should be considered.","Salman, D.; Beaney, T.; Robb, C.; Loots, C.

Weeks after an often mild or asymptomatic initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 children may present with a severe shock-like picture and marked inflammation. Children with MIS-C present with varying degrees of cardiovascular and hyperinflammatory symptoms. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the plasma proteome of more than 1400 proteins in children with SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized that the proteome would reflect heterogeneity in hyperinflammation and vascular injury, and further identify pathogenic mediators of disease. Protein signatures demonstrated overlap between MIS-C, and the inflammatory syndromes macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). We demonstrate that PLA2G2A is a key marker of MIS-C that associates with TMA. We found that IFN{gamma} responses are dysregulated in MIS-C patients, and that IFN{gamma} levels delineate clinical heterogeneity.","Diorio, C.; Shraim, R.; Vella, L. A.; Giles, J. R.; Baxter, A.

MethodsA cross-sectional analysis was conducted a medical college and hospital complex in Delhi, India through telephonic interviews among HCWs who had received at-least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine during January to March 2021. Breakthrough infections were operationally defined as occurrence of Covid-19 infection [&ge;]14 days after administration of two doses of either Covid-19 vaccine.

ResultsWe enrolled 325 HCWs with mean (SD) age of 29.1 (9.9) years including 211 (64.9%) males. Two seventy nine (85.8%) HCWs were fully vaccinated while 46 (14.2%) were partially vaccinated. There were 168 (51.7%) BBV152 and 157 (48.3%) AZD1222 (ChAdOx1-S) recipients.

A total of 37 (11.3%, 95% C.I. 8.3, 15.3) breakthrough infections were observed in the HCWs. The median (IQR) time until incidence of Covid-19 breakthrough infection since receiving second dose of either Covid-19 vaccine was 47 (28.5, 55) days. Additionally, 20 (6.1%) non-breakthrough Covid-19 infections were recorded in the HCWs post vaccination with either a single dose of a Covid-19 vaccine or both doses but prior to a period of 14 days since administration of the second dose.

Most breakthrough infection cases (94.4%) were mild and did not require supplemental oxygen therapy. HCWs without a history of natural Covid-19 infection and recovery prior to vaccination were 3.8 times more at risk to contract a Covid-19 infection or reinfection in spite of vaccination with at-least one dose of either Covid-19 vaccine.

ConclusionNearly one in nine HCWs experienced a Covid-19 breakthrough infection in the present study.","Sharma, P.; Mishra, S.; Basu, S.; Tanwar, N.; Kumar, R.",2021-06-11,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.06.07.21258447,2,Saurav Basu,"Department of Community Medicine, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.07.21258447v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.07.21258447v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

27672,The impact of Covid-19 vaccination on the Italian healthcare system: a scenario analysis,"IntroductionThe objective of this study is to estimate the effects of the national immunisation strategy for Covid-19 in Italy on the national healthcare system.

MethodsAn epidemiological scenario analysis was developed in order to simulate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Italian national healthcare system in 2021. Hospitalisations, ICU admissions and death rates were modelled based on 2020 data. We forecast the impact of the introduction of a primary prevention strategy on the national healthcare system by considering vaccine efficacy, availability of doses and potential population coverage over time.

ResultsIn the absence of immunisation, between 57,000 and 63,000 additional deaths are forecast in 2021. Based on the assumptions underlying the two epidemiological scenarios from the 2020 data, our model predicts that cumulative hospital admissions in 2021 will range from 3.4 to 3.9 million. The deployment of vaccine immunisation has the potential to control the evolution of 2021 infections and avoid from 60 to 67 percent of deaths compared to not vaccinating.

ConclusionsIn order to inform Italian policymakers on delivering a mass vaccination programme, this study highlights and detects some key factors that must be controlled to ensure that immunisation targets will be met in reasonable time.","Marcellusi, A.; Fabiano, G.; Sciattella, P.; Andreoni, M.; Mennini, F.

27347,Prevention and Attenuation of COVID-19 by BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 Vaccines,"BACKGROUNDInformation is limited on messenger RNA (mRNA) BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection or attenuating disease when administered in real-world conditions.

METHODSProspective cohorts of 3,975 healthcare personnel, first responders, and other essential and frontline workers completed weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing during December 14 2020--April 10 2021. Self-collected mid-turbinate nasal swabs were tested by qualitative and quantitative reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR). VE was calculated as 100%x(1-hazard ratio); adjusted VE was calculated using vaccination propensity weights and adjustments for site, occupation, and local virus circulation.

RESULTSSARS-CoV-2 was detected in 204 (5.1%) participants; 16 were partially ([&ge;]14 days post-dose-1 to 13 days after dose-2) or fully ([&ge;]14 days post-dose-2) vaccinated, and 156 were unvaccinated; 32 with indeterminate status (<14 days after dose-1) were excluded. Adjusted mRNA VE of full vaccination was 91% (95% confidence interval [CI]=76%-97%) against symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection; VE of partial vaccination was 81% (95% CI=64%-90%). Among partially or fully vaccinated participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, mean viral RNA load (Log10 copies/mL) was 40% lower (95% CI=16%-57%), the risk of self-reported febrile COVID-19 was 58% lower (Risk Ratio=0.42, 95% CI=0.18-0.98), and 2.3 fewer days (95% CI=0.8-3.7) were spent sick in bed compared to unvaccinated infected participants.

CONCLUSIONSAuthorized mRNA vaccines were highly effective among working-age adults in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections when administered in real-world conditions and attenuated viral RNA load, febrile symptoms, and illness duration among those with breakthrough infection despite vaccination.","Thompson, M.

20399,Long-term neurological manifestations of COVID-19: prevalence and predictive factors,"BackgroundClinical investigations have argued for long-term neurological manifestations in both hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It is unclear whether long-term neurological symptoms and features depend on COVID-19 severity.

Methodsfrom a sample of 208 consecutive non-neurological patients hospitalized for COVID-19 disease, 165 survivors were re-assessed at 6 months according to a structured standardized clinical protocol. Prevalence and predictors of long-term neurological manifestations were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analyses.

ResultsAt 6-month follow-up after hospitalisation due to COVID-19 disease, patients displayed a wide array of symptoms; fatigue (34%), memory/attention (31%), and sleep disorders (30%) were the most frequent. At neurological examination, 40% of patients exhibited neurological abnormalities, such as hyposmia (18.0%), cognitive deficits (17.5%), postural tremor (13.8%) and subtle motor/sensory deficits (7.6%). Older age, premorbid comorbidities and severity of COVID-19 were independent predictors of neurological manifestations in logistic regression analyses.

11906,Probability of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2,"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 leading to COVID-19 occurs through exhaled respiratory droplets from infected humans. Currently, however, there is much controversy over whether respiratory aerosol microdroplets play an important role as a route of transmission. By measuring and modeling the dynamics of exhaled respiratory droplets we can assess the relative contribution of aerosols in the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. We measure size distribution, total numbers and volumes of respiratory droplets, including aerosols, by speaking and coughing from healthy subjects. Dynamic modelling of exhaled respiratory droplets allows to account for aerosol persistence times in confined public spaces. The probability of infection by inhalation of aerosols when breathing in the same space can then be estimated using current estimates of viral load and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. In line with the current known reproduction numbers, our study of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that aerosol transmission is an inefficient route, in particular from non or mildly symptomatic individuals.","Bonn, D.; Smith, S.

23830,SARS-CoV-2 infection and risk of clinical sequelae during the post-acute phase: a retrospective cohort study,"ObjectiveClinical sequelae have not been well characterized during the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 among adults 18 to 65 years old, and this study sought to fill that gap by evaluating excess risk and relative hazards for developing incident clinical sequelae during the post-acute phase.

DesignRetrospective cohort study including three propensity-matched groups.

SettingThis study merged three data sources from a large United States health plan: a large national administrative claims database, an outpatient lab testing database, and an inpatient hospital admissions database.

ParticipantsIndividuals 18 to 65 years old with continuous health plan enrollment from January 2019 to date of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Three comparator groups were identified and propensity-score matched to individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2: a 2020 comparator group, a historical 2019 comparator group and a historical comparator group with viral lower respiratory tract illness (vLRTI).

Main outcome measuresOver 50 clinical sequelae during the post-acute phase (index date + 21 days) were ascertained using ICD-10 codes. Excess risk due to SARS-CoV-2 during the 4 months following the acute phase of illness and hazard ratios with 95% Bonferroni-corrected confidence intervals were calculated.

ResultsThis study found 14% of adults [&le;]65 years of age who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=193113) had at least one new clinical sequelae that required medical attention during the post-acute phase of illness. When considering risk for specific sequelae attributable to SARS-Cov-2 infection during the post-acute phase, clinical outcomes including chronic respiratory failure, cardiac arrythmia, hypercoagulability, encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, amnesia (memory difficulty), diabetes, liver test abnormalities, myocarditis, anxiety and fatigue were significantly elevated compared to the three propensity-matched comparator groups (2020, 2019, vLRTI). Significant risk differences due to SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from 0.02 to 2.26 per 100 people and hazard ratios ranged from 1.24 to 25.65 when compared to the 2020 comparator group.

ConclusionsOur results confirm excess risk for developing clinical sequelae due to SARS-CoV-2 during the post-acute phase, including specific types of sequelae less commonly seen among other viral illnesses. Although individuals who were older, had pre-existing conditions, and were hospitalized due to COVID-19 were at greatest excess risk, younger adults ([&le;]50 years), adults who did not have pre-existing conditions or adults who were not hospitalized due to COVID-19 were still at elevated risk for developing new clinical sequelae. The elevated risk for incident sequelae during the post-acute phase is relevant for healthcare planning.

Summary BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSSmall observational studies and case reports of hospitalized patients have shown some COVID-19 survivors suffer from short- and long-term sequelae. Few studies have characterized the excess risk of clinical sequelae attributable to SARS-CoV-2 during the post-acute phase among adults [&le;]65 years of age in a large generalizable sample.

What this study addsThis study found 14% of individuals [&le;]65 years of age who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=193113) had a diagnosis of at least one new sequelae that required medical attention during the post-acute phase of illness. Elevated risk for specific clinical sequelae during the post-acute phase of illness was noted across a range of organ systems including cardiovascular, neurologic, kidney, respiratory, and mental health complications. The risk for incident sequelae increases with age, pre-existing conditions, and hospitalization for COVID-19; however, even among adults [&le;] 50 years of age and individuals without pre-existing conditions or hospitalization due to COVID-19, risk for some clinical sequelae is still elevated. These results indicate where additional diagnostic follow-up, rehabilitation, and symptom management may be warranted among younger adults with milder infection.","Daugherty, S.

18441,Community prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and correlates of protective immunity in an Indian metropolitan city,"ObjectivesTo assess seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a densely populated urban Indian settings and its implications for disease trends and protective immunity.

DesignCross-sectional sero-epidemiological survey linked with administrative reporting of COVID-19 testing data.

SettingsPune city in western India

Main outcome measurePrevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies were estimated and along with correlates of virus neutralisation and other immune and inflammatory markers.

ResultsSeropositivity was extensive (51{middle dot}3%; 95%CI 39{middle dot}9 to 62{middle dot}4) but varied widely in the five localities tested, ranging from 35{middle dot}8% to 66{middle dot}4%. Seropositivity was higher in crowded living conditions in the slums (OR 1{middle dot}91), and was lower in those 65 years or older (OR 0{middle dot}59). The infection-fatality ratio was estimated at 0.21%. Post survey, COVID-19 incidence was lower in areas noted to have higher seroprevalence. Substantial virus-neutralising activity was observed in seropositive individuals, but with considerable heterogeneity in the immune response and possible age-dependent diversity in the antibody repertoire.

ConclusionDespite crowded living conditions having facilitated widespread transmission, the variability in seroprevalence in localities that are in geographical proximity indicates a heterogenous spread of infection. Declining infection rates in areas with high seropositivity suggest population-level protection. It is also supported by substantial neutralising activity in asymptomatically infected individuals. This is the first report of a significantly high proportion of protective immune response among asymptomatic individuals in the population. The heterogeneity in antibody levels and neutralisation capacity indicates the existence of immunological sub-groups of functional interest.

16499,"Identifying Optimal COVID-19 Testing Strategies for Schools and Businesses: Balancing Testing Frequency, Individual Test Technology, and Cost","BackgroundCOVID-19 test sensitivity and specificity have been widely examined and discussed yet optimal use of these tests will depend on the goals of testing, the population or setting, and the anticipated underlying disease prevalence. We model various combinations of key variables to identify and compare a range of effective and practical surveillance strategies for schools and businesses.

MethodsWe coupled a simulated data set incorporating actual community prevalence and test performance characteristics to a susceptible, infectious, removed (SIR) compartmental model, modeling the impact of base and tunable variables including test sensitivity, testing frequency, results lag, sample pooling, disease prevalence, externally-acquired infections, and test cost on outcomes case reduction.

ResultsIncreasing testing frequency was associated with a non-linear positive effect on cases averted over 100 days. While precise reductions in cumulative number of infections depended on community disease prevalence, testing every 3 days versus every 14 days (even with a lower sensitivity test) reduces the disease burden substantially. Pooling provided cost savings and made a high-frequency approach practical; one high-performing strategy, testing every 3 days, yielded per person per day costs as low as $1.32.

ConclusionsA range of practically viable testing strategies emerged for schools and businesses. Key characteristics of these strategies include high frequency testing with a moderate or high sensitivity test and minimal results delay. Sample pooling allowed for operational efficiency and cost savings with minimal loss of model performance.","Lyng, G. D.; Sheils, N. E.; Kennedy, C. J.; Griffin, D.; Berke, E.

4551,Importance of untested infectious individuals for the suppression of COVID-19 epidemics,"The impact of the extent of testing infectious individuals on suppression of COVID-19 is illustrated from the early stages of outbreaks in Germany, the Hubei province of China, Italy, Spain and the UK. The predicted percentage of untested infected individuals depends on the specific outbreak but we found that they typically represent 50% to 80% of the infected individuals. Even when unreported cases are taken into account, we estimate that less than 8% of the population would have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by 09/04/2020 in the analysed outbreaks. These levels are far below the 70-85% needed to ensure herd immunity and would predict a resurgence of infection if ongoing lockdowns in the outbreaks are fully lifted. We propose that partially lifted lockdowns together with early and thorough testing allowing for quick isolation of both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases could lead to suppression of secondary waves of COVID-19 epidemics.","Perez-Reche, F.

13380,Clinical and Epidemiological Characteristics of the First Month of the Covid-19 Pandemic in Chile,"IntroductionUnderstanding the clinical course and outcomes of patients with Covid-19 in underrepresented populations like Latin America is paramount. In this study, we report the clinical characteristics of Covid-19 in Chile, with a focus on subjects requiring hospitalization during the initial phases of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

MethodsThis is a single center study including all consecutive patients diagnosed with Covid-19 during the first month of the pandemic. Demographics, clinical characteristics and laboratory data were collected within 24 hours of admission. The primary outcome was a composite of ICU admission or all-cause, in-hospital mortality.

ResultsDuring the first month of the pandemic, 381 patients were confirmed as positive for SARS-CoV-2 by molecular testing; 88 (23.1%) of them eventually required hospitalization. Median age of the cohort was 39 years (IQR 31-49). Overall mortality was 0.7% and 18 (3.7%) out of the 88 subjects who required hospitalization either died and/or required ICU. Increased body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein levels (CRP) and the SaTO2/FiO2 index on admission were independently associated with a higher risk of ICU care or death.

DiscussionThe lower mortality observed in our prospective cohort during the first month of SARS-Cov-2 pandemic was lower than previously reported. This finding could be due to a lower threshold for admission, a healthcare system not yet overburdened and a younger population, among other factors. BMI, CRP on admission were strong predictors for ICU care or all-cause, in-hospital mortality. Our data provide important information regarding the clinical course of Covid-19 in Latin America.","Vial, M.

11502,'Trained immunity' from  Mycobacterium spp. exposure or BCG vaccination and COVID-19 outcomes,"Protective variables for COVID-19 are unknown.  Trained immunity of the populace as a result of BCG immunization policy implementation and coverage had been suggested to be one of the factors responsible for the differential impact of COVID-19 on different countries. Several trials are underway to evaluate the potential protective role of BCG vaccination in COVID-19. However, the lack of clarity on the use of appropriate controls concerning the measures of  trained immunity or the heterologous cell-mediated immunity conferred by BCG vaccination has been a cause of concern leading to more confusion as exemplified by a recently concluded trial in Israel that failed to find any protective correlation with regard to BCG vaccination. Whereas, when we analyze the COVID-19 data of European countries without any regard for BCG vaccination policy but with similar age distribution, comparable confounding variables, and the stage of the pandemic, the prevalence of tuberculin immunoreactivity - a measure of cell-mediated immunity persistence as a result of Mycobacterium spp. (including BCG vaccine) exposure of the populations, is found consistently negatively correlated with COVID-19 infections and mortality per million population, at all the time points evaluated. We propose that on-going and future studies evaluating the effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 outcomes may actively consider, if not already, the inclusion of controls for underlying  trained immunity and heterologous cell-mediated immunity prevalence that may be pre-existing or resulting from the intervention (e.g., BCG vaccine) in such trials to arrive at more dependable conclusions concerning their potential benefit.","Singh, S.; Maurya, R.

Policymakers are assessing how best to navigate through the ongoing epidemic, with models being used to predict the spread of infection and assess the impact of public health measures. Here, we present OpenABM-Covid19: an agent-based simulation of the epidemic including detailed age-stratification and realistic social networks. By default the model is parameterised to UK demographics and calibrated to the UK epidemic, however, it can easily be re-parameterised for other countries. OpenABM-Covid19 can evaluate non-pharmaceutical interventions, including both manual and digital contact tracing. It can simulate a population of 1 million people in seconds per day allowing parameter sweeps and formal statistical model-based inference. The code is open-source and has been developed by teams both inside and outside academia, with an emphasis on formal testing, documentation, modularity and transparency. A key feature of OpenABM-Covid19 is its Python interface, which has allowed scientists and policymakers to simulate dynamic packages of interventions and help compare options to suppress the COVID-19 epidemic.","Hinch, R.; Probert, W.

7229,Age-dependence of mortality from novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in highly exposed populations: New York transit workers and residents and Diamond Princess passengers.,"BackgroundPopulations heavily exposed to the novel coronavirus provide an opportunity to estimate the mortality from COVID-19 in different age groups.

MethodsThe mortality reported by May 13 from COVID-19 among Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers, and New York residents and Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) workers was estimated based on publicly available information.

ResultsThe mortality among children (age 0 to 17 yrs) in New York City was 1 in 172,692. The mortality in New York state was 1 in 322,217 for ages 10-19 yrs., and 1 in 36,725 for ages 20-29 yrs. The mortality among New York transit workers was estimated to be 1 in 7,329 for ages 30-39 years; 1 in 1,075 for ages 40-49 yrs.; 1 in 343 for ages 50-59 yrs.; and 1 in 178 for ages 60-69 yrs. Among Diamond Princess passengers, the mortality was estimated to be 1 in 145 for ages 70-79, and 1 in 54 for ages 80-89.

ConclusionsMortality among populations exposed to the novel coronavirus increases with age, ranging from about 1 in 170,000 below the age of 18 years, to 1 in 54 above the age of 80 years.","Leffler, C.

12640,An Outpatient Telehealth Elective for Displaced Clinical Learners during the Coronavirus Pandemic,"IntroductionIn response to the Coronavirus pandemic, medical schools suspended clinical rotations. This displacement of students from the wards has limited experiential learning opportunities. Concurrently, outpatient practices are experiencing reduced volumes of in-person visits and shifting towards virtual healthcare. This transition comes with its own logistical challenges. Here, we discuss a workflow that enabled students to engage in meaningful clinical education while helping the RWJMS outpatient practices implement remote telehealth visits.

MethodsA four-week virtual elective was designed to offer clerkship students the opportunity to participate in virtual telehealth patient encounters. Students were prepared with EMR training and introduced to an outpatient workflow that supports healthcare providers in the ambulatory setting. Patients were consented to telehealth services before encounters with students. All collected clinical information was documented in the EMR, after which students transitioned patients to a virtual Doxy.me video call appointment. Clinical and educational outcomes of students participation were evaluated.

ResultsSurvey results showed students felt well-prepared to initiate patient encounters. They also expressed comfort while engaging with patients virtually during telehealth appointments. Students further identified educational value, citing opportunities to develop patient management plans consistent with in-person clinical experiences. A significant healthcare burden was also alleviated by student involvement. Over 1000 total scheduled appointments were serviced by students who transitioned over 80% of patients into virtual provider waiting rooms.

DiscussionAfter piloting this elective with rising fourth-year students, pre-clerkship students were also recruited to act in a role normally associated with clinical learners (e.g., elicit patient histories, conduct a review of systems, etc.). An additional telehealth elective is being designed so medical students can contribute to inpatient care without risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. These efforts are designed to allow students to continue with their clinical education during the pandemic.","Weber, A.

9028,Review of published systematic reviews and meta-analyses on COVID-19,"PurposeThe rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted researchers from all over the world to share their experience. The results were numerous reports with variable quality. The latter has provided an impetus to examine all published meta-analyses and systematic reviews on COVID-19 to date to examine available evidence. Methods: Using predefined selection criteria, a literature search identified 43 eligible meta-analyses and/or systematic reviews. Results: Most (N=17) studies addressed clinical manifestations and associated comorbidity, 6 studies addressed clinical manifestations in pregnant women and younger individuals, 8 studies addressed diagnostic data, 9 studies addressed various interventions, and 9 studies addressed prevention and control. The number of studies included in the various systemic reviews and meta-analyses ranged from 2 to 89. While there were some similarities and consistency for some findings, e.g. the relation between comorbidities and disease severity, we also noted occasionally conflicting data. Conclusion: As more data are collected from patients infected with COVID-19 all over the world, more studies will undoubtedly be published and attention to scientific accuracy in the performance of trials must be exercised to inform clinical decision-making and treatment guidelines.","Ibrahim, E.; Ibrahim, N.

23249,On the Environmental Determinants of COVID-19 Seasonality,"Viral respiratory diseases (VRDs), such as influenza and COVID-19, are thought to spread faster over winter than during summer. It has been previously argued that cold and dry conditions were more conducive to the transmission of VRD than warm and humid climates, although this relationship appears restricted to temperate regions, and the causal relationship is not well understood. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 has emerged as a serious global public health problem after the first COVID-19 reports in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It is still unclear whether this novel respiratory disease will ultimately prove to be a seasonal endemic disease. Here, we suggest that Air Drying Capacity (ADC; an atmospheric state-variable known to control the fate/evolution of the virus-laden droplets) and ultraviolet radiation (UV) are probable environmental determinants in shaping the transmission of COVID-19 at the seasonal time scale. These variables, unlike temperature and humidity, provide a physically-based framework consistent with the apparent seasonal variability in COVID-19 prevalence across a broad range of climates (e.g., Germany and India). Since this disease is known to be influenced by the compounding effect of social, biological, and environmental determinants, this study does not claim that these environmental determinants exclusively shape the seasonality of COVID-19. However, we argue that ADC and UV play a significant role in COVID-19 dynamics at the seasonal scale. These findings could help guide the development of a sound adaptation strategy against the pandemic over the coming seasons.

Plain Language SummaryThere is growing scientific interest in the potential seasonality of COVID-19 and its links to climate variables. This study aims to determine whether four environmental variables, namely temperature, humidity, Air Drying Capacity (ADC), and ultraviolet radiation (UV), are probable environmental determinants for the observed seasonal dynamics of COVID-19 prevalence, based on extensive country-level data spanning the first year of the pandemic. Although the influence of socio-economic factors may be dominant, we here suggest that ADC and UV are key environmental determinants of COVID-19 and can potentially affect the transmission and seasonality of the disease across a wide range of climates.

Key PointsO_LIThe seasonality of COVID-19 appears to follow seasonality of some environmental variables.
C_LIO_LISeasonality of air drying capacity and ultraviolet radiation consistently match seasonality of COVID-19, across climatic zones.
C_LIO_LISeasonality of air humidity and temperature, match seasonality of COVID-19 in temperate climates, but not in tropical monsoon climates.

15820,"INFERRED RESOLUTION THROUGH HERD IMMMUNITY OF FIRST COVID-19 WAVE IN MANAUS, BRAZILIAN AMAZON","INTRODUCTORY PARAGRAPHAs in many other settings, peak excess mortality preceded the officially reported  first wave peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Manaus, Brazil, reflecting delayed case recognition and limited initial access to diagnostic testing. To avoid early information bias, we used detailed age and gender stratified death certificate and hospitalisation data to evaluate the epidemics trajectory and infer the cause of its decline using a stochastic model. Our results are consistent with heterogenous transmission reducing over time due to the development of herd immunity. Relative to a baseline model that assumed homogenous mixing across Manaus, a model that permitted a small, self-isolated population fraction raised the estimated herd-immunity threshold from 28% to 30% and reduced the final attack rate from 86% to 65%. In the latter scenario, a substantial proportion of vulnerable, older individuals remained susceptible to infection. Given uncertainties regarding the distancing behaviours of population subgroups with different social and economic characteristics, and the duration of sterilising or transmission-modifying immunity in exposed individuals, we conclude that the potential for epidemic outbreaks remains, but that future waves of infection are likely to be much less pronounced than that already experienced.","Prowse, T.; Purcell, T.; Clarys Baia-Da-Silva, D.; Sampaio, V.; Marcelo Monteiro, W.; Wood, J.; Mueller, I.; Mcvernon, J.; Lacerda, M.; Ross, J.",2020-10-15,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.25.20201939,3,Joshua Ross,University of Adelaide,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.25.20201939v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.25.20201939v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,"NA"
27912,Rural prioritization may increase the impact of COVID-19 vaccines in Sub-Saharan Africa due to ongoing internal migration: A modeling study,"How COVID-19 vaccine is distributed within low- and middle-income countries has received little attention outside of equity or logistical concerns but may ultimately affect campaign impact in terms of infections, severe cases, or deaths averted. In this study we examined whether subnational (urban-rural) prioritization may affect the cumulative two-year impact on disease transmission and burden of a vaccination campaign using an agent-based model of COVID-19 in a representative Sub-Saharan Africa country setting. We simulated a range of vaccination strategies that differed by urban-rural prioritization, age group prioritization, timing of introduction, and final coverage level. Urban prioritization averted more infections in only a narrow set of scenarios, when internal migration rates were low and vaccination was started by day 30 of an outbreak. Rural prioritization was the optimal strategy for all other scenarios, e.g., with higher internal migration rates or later start dates, due to the presence of a large immunological naive rural population. Among other factors, timing of the vaccination campaign was important to determining maximum impact, and delays as short as 30 days prevented larger campaigns from having the same impact as smaller campaigns that began earlier. The optimal age group for prioritization depended on choice of metric, as prioritizing older adults consistently averted more deaths across all of the scenarios. While guidelines exist for these latter factors, urban-rural allocation is an orthogonal factor that we predict to affect impact and warrants consideration as countries plan the scale-up of their vaccination campaigns.","Selvaraj, P.; Wagner, B.

23082,Household COVID-19 risk and in-person schooling,"In-person schooling has proved contentious and difficult to study throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from a massive online survey in the United States indicates an increased risk of COVID-19-related outcomes among respondents living with a child attending school in-person. School-based mitigation measures are associated with significant reductions in risk, particularly daily symptoms screens, teacher masking, and closure of extra-curricular activities. With seven or more mitigation measures, the association between in-person schooling and COVID-19-related outcomes all but disappears. Teachers working outside the home were more likely to report COVID-19-related outcomes, but this association is similar to other occupations (e.g., healthcare, office work). In-person schooling is associated with household COVID-19 risk, but this risk can likely be controlled with properly implemented school-based mitigation measures.

One sentence summaryLiving with children attending in-person school is linked to a higher risk of COVID-19 outcomes, which school-based interventions can mitigate.","Lessler, J.; Grabowski, M.

20928,Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Neuromuscular Performance in Patients Recovered from COVID-19,"ObjectiveCOVID-19 affects cardiorespiratory and muscular systems, causing dysfunctions that may persist after recovery from the acute infection and treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate cardiorespiratory fitness and neuromuscular performance in these patients.

MethodsPatients recovered from mild (n=31) and severe (n=17) COVID-19 were evaluated and compared to healthy subjects (n=15). All volunteers underwent a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test with simultaneous acquisition of electromyography (EMG). Power output, oxygen uptake (VO2), pulse oxygen (O2Pulse), cardiovascular efficiency ({Delta}HR/{Delta}VO2), ventilation (VE), breathing reserve (BR) and ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO2 slope) were analyzed. From EMG, power output for type Ia and IIa activation as well as total neuromuscular efficiency ({Delta}watts/{Delta}%RMS) were determined.

ResultsPatients with severe COVID-19 presented lower VO2, O2Pulse and VE than mild COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). No differences in {Delta}HR/{Delta}VO2, BR or VE/VCO2 slope were observed among the groups (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). Type IIa and IIb fibers were activated at lower power output in severe than in mild COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects (p < 0.05). {Delta}watts/{Delta}%RMS was lower in severe than in mild COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects (p < 0.05).

4536,Automated and semi-automated contact tracing: Protocol for a rapid review of available evidence and current challenges to inform the control of COVID-19,"IntroductionTraditional approaches to case-finding, case isolation, and contact tracing methods have so far proved insufficient on their own to prevent the development of local epidemics of COVID-19 in many high-income countries despite relatively advanced public health systems. As a result, many governments have resorted to widespread social distancing measures and mass quarantines ( lock-downs) to reduce transmission and to prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. However, such measures impose heavy human and societal costs. Automated or semi-automated digital contact tracing, in conjunction with scaled-up community testing, has been proposed as a key part of exit strategies from lockdowns. However, the effectiveness of these approaches to contact tracing is unclear, and to be effective, trusted, and widely adopted such technology must overcome several challenges.

Methods and analysisWe will perform a rapid systematic review to assess the effectiveness of automated and semi-automated digital tools for contact tracing, and identify key considerations for successful implementation, to inform the control of COVID-19. We will search PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO Medical COVID information portal, OVID Global Health, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, BioRxiv, and arXiv for peer-reviewed and pre-print papers on automated or semi-automated digital tools for contact tracing of COVID-19, another respiratory disease with pandemic potential (limited to SARS, MERS, or pandemic influenza), or Ebola, in human populations.

The data for the study were pooled from studies that contained the search terms """"Obesity"""" AND (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV or Coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2) AND (""""ICU admission"""" OR """"Hospitalization"""" OR """"Disease severity"""" OR """"Invasive mechanical ventilator"""" OR """"Death"""" OR """"Mortality""""). All the online searches were supplemented by reference screening of retrieved studies for additional literature. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) from the retrieved studies were calculated using the random effect model (Inverse-Variance method).

FindingsFive studies with a combined sample size of 335,192 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled OR from the final analysis showed that patients who are severely obese were more likely to experience adverse outcome (death or ICU admission or needing IMV or hospitalization) compared to the normal patients [OR = 2.81, 95% CI = 2.33 - 3.40, I2 = 29%].

One key aspect to transition safely out of lockdown is to continuously test the population for infected subjects. Currently, detection is performed at points of care using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR), and requires dedicated professionals and equipment. Here, we developed a protocol based on Reverse Transcribed Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) for detection of SARS-CoV-2. This protocol is applied directly on SARS-CoV-2 nose and throat swabs, with no RNA purification step required. We tested this protocol on over 180 suspected patients, and compared its results to the standard method. We further succeeded to apply the protocol on self-sampled saliva from confirmed cases. Since the proposed protocol provides results on-the-spot, and can detect SARS-CoV-2 from saliva, it can allow simple and continuous surveillance of the community.","Ben-Assa, N.; Naddaf, R.; Gefen, T.; Capucha, T.; Hajjo, H.; Mandelbaum, N.; Elbaum, L.; Rogov, P.; King, D.

5227,Optimal strategies for quarantine stopping in France. General expected patterns of strategies focusing on contact between age groups,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have implemented a complete lockdown of their population that may not be sustainable for long. To identify the best strategy to replace this full lockdown, sophisticated models that rely on mobility data have been developed. In this study, using the example of France as a case-study, we develop a simple model considering contacts between age classes to derive the general impact of partial lockdown strategies targeted at specific age groups. We found that epidemic suppression can only be achieved by targeting isolation of young and middle age groups with high efficiency. All other strategies tested result in a flatter epidemic curve, with outcomes in (e.g. mortality and health system over-capacity) dependent of the age groups targeted and the isolation efficiency. Targeting only the elderly can decrease the expected mortality burden, but in proportions lower than more integrative strategies involving several age groups. While not aiming to provide quantitative forecasts, our study shows the benefits and constraints of different partial lockdown strategies, which could help guide decision-making.","Roche, B.; Garchitorena, A.; Roiz, D.",2020-04-24,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.21.20073932,1,Benjamin Roche,IRD,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.21.20073932v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.21.20073932v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"

20910,Monitoring the proportion infected by SARS-CoV-2 from age-stratified hospitalisation and serological data,"BackgroundRegional monitoring of the proportion infected by SARS-CoV-2 is important to guide local management of the epidemic, but is difficult in the absence of regular nationwide serosurveys.

MethodsWe developed a method to reconstruct in real-time the proportion infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the proportion of infections being detected from the joint analysis of age-stratified seroprevalence, hospitalisation and case data. We applied our approach to the 13 French metropolitan regions.

FindingsWe estimate that 5.7% [5.1%-6.4%] of adults in metropolitan France had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 by May 2020. This proportion remained stable until August and increased to 12.6% [11.2%-14.3%] by the end of November. With 23.8% [21.2%-26.8%] infected in the Paris region compared to 4.0% [3.5% - 4.6%] in Brittany, regional variations remained large (Coefficient of Variation CV: 0.53) although less so than in May (CV: 0.74). The proportion infected was twice higher (17.6% [13.4%-22.7%]) in 20-49 y.o. than in 50+ y.o (8.0% [5.7% - 11.5%]). Forty percent [33.7% - 45.4%] of infections in adults were detected in June-August compared to 55.7% [48.7% - 63.1%] in September-November. Our method correctly predicted seroprevalence in 11 regions in which only hospitalisation data were used.

InterpretationIn the absence of contemporary serosurvey, our real-time monitoring indicates that the proportion infected by SARS-CoV-2 may be above 20% in some French regions.

Of the residents, 13% showed positive IgM results and 15% positive IgG results. In 17% of the residents, at least one of the antibodies was positive. In total 13% of the staff members had positive IgM and 16% had a positive IgG. In 20% of the staff members at least one of these antibody tests was positive. In PCR positive residents, the percentage of IgM positive, IgG positive, and at least one of both was 28%, 34%, and 41%. In PCR positive staff, we found 30%, 60%, and 60%. Additional antibody tests were performed in nine residents between day 11 and 14 after the positive PCR test. Of those, 7 (78%) tested positive on at least one antibody. When retesting three weeks later, all remaining residents also tested positive.

conclusionsRecently it was reported that in Belgium antibodies are present in 3-4% of the general population. Although, the prevalence in our residents is higher, the number is largely insufficient for herd immunity. In staff members of the regional hospital the prevalence of antibodies was 6%. The higher prevalence in nursing home staff (21%) may be related to the complete absence of good quality protection in the first weeks of the outbreak.

Article summaryO_LSTStrengths and limitations of this studyC_LST- This is the first study in Belgium examining the prevalence of COVID-19 and the presence of antibodies in residents and staff members of a nursing home
- The internal procedural control was positive -with one exception- in all tests, which suggests good quality sampling and testing.
- Some degree of selection bias should be assumed in residents, since some residents were absent; mostly from hospitalisation or death which can be related to the presence of COVID-related disease.
- The study was set up in one nursing home and is consequently not representative for the whole of the Flemish community","Buntinx, F.; Claes, P.; Gulikers, M.; Verbakel, J.

17189,"Digital contact-tracing during the Covid-19 pandemic: an analysis of newspaper coverage in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland","Governments around the globe have started to develop and deploy digital contact tracing apps to gain control over the spread of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19). The appropriateness and usefulness of these technologies as a containment measure have since sparked political and academic discussions globally. The present paper contributes to this debate through an exploration of how the national daily newspapers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland reported on the development and adoption of digital contact-tracing apps during early and after stages of the lockdown. These countries were among the first in Europe to develop apps and were critical voices in the debate of decentralized vs. centralized data processing. We conducted thematic analysis on news coverage published between January and May 2020 in high-circulation national daily newspapers (print) from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. A total of 148 newspaper articles were included in the final analysis. From our analysis emerged six core themes of the development and adoption of digital contact tracing apps: 1) data governance; 2) role of IT giants; 3) scientific rigor; 4) voluntariness; 5) functional efficacy; 6) role of the app. These results shed light on the different facets of discussion regarding digital contact tracing as portrayed in German-speaking media. As news coverage can serve as a proxy for public perception, this study complements emerging survey data on public perceptions of digital contact tracing apps by identifying potential issues of public concern.","Amann, J.; Sleigh, J.; Vayena, E.",2020-10-26,Health Policy,10.1101/2020.10.22.20216788,1,Julia Amann,ETH Zurich,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.22.20216788v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.22.20216788v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1371/journal.pone.0246524
11630,COVID-19 misinformation: mere harmless delusions or much more? A knowledge and attitude cross-sectional study among the general public residing in Jordan,"Since the emergence of the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its spread as a pandemic, media was teeming with misinformation that led to psychologic, social and economic consequences among the global public. Probing knowledge and anxiety regarding this novel infectious disease is necessary to identify gaps and sources of misinformation which can help public health efforts to design and implement more focused interventional measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and effects of misinformation about COVID-19 on anxiety level among the general public residing in Jordan. An online survey was used that targeted people aged 18 and above and residing in Jordan. The questionnaire included items on the following: demographic characteristics of the participants, knowledge about COVID-19, anxiety level and misconceptions regarding the origin of the pandemic. The total number of participants included in final analysis was 3150. The study population was predominantly females (76.0%), with mean age of 31 years. The overall knowledge of COVID-19 was satisfactory. Older age, male gender, lower monthly income and educational levels, smoking and history of chronic disease were associated with perceiving COVID-19 as a very dangerous disease. Variables that were associated with a higher anxiety level during the pandemic included: lower monthly income and educational level, residence outside the capital (Amman) and history of smoking. Misinformation about the origin of the pandemic (being part of a conspiracy, biologic warfare and the 5G networks role) was also associated with higher anxiety and lower knowledge about the disease. Social media platforms, TV and news releases were the most common sources of information about the pandemic. The study showed the potential harmful effects of misinformation on the general public and emphasized the need to meticulously deliver timely and accurate information about the pandemic to lessen the health, social and psychological impact of the disease.","Sallam, M.; Dababseh, D.; Yaseen, A.; Al-Haidar, A.; Taim, D.; Eid, H.; Ababneh, N.

22179,A mechanistic and data-driven reconstruction of the time-varying reproduction number: Application to the COVID-19 epidemic,"The effective reproduction number Reff is a critical epidemiological parameter that characterizes the transmissibility of a pathogen. However, this parameter is difficult to estimate in the presence of silent transmission and/or significant temporal variation in case reporting. This variation can occur due to the lack of timely or appropriate testing, public health interventions and/or changes in human behavior during an epidemic. This is exactly the situation we are confronted with during this COVID-19 pandemic.

In this work, we propose to estimate Reff for the SARS-CoV-2 (the etiological agent of the COVID-19), based on a model of its propagation considering a time-varying transmission rate. This rate is modeled by a Brownian diffusion process embedded in a stochastic model. The model is then fitted by Bayesian inference (particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo method) using multiple well-documented hospital datasets from several regions in France and in Ireland. This mechanistic modeling framework enables us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the transmission rate of the COVID-19 based only on the available data. Except for the specific model structure, it is non-specifically assumed that the transmission rate follows a basic stochastic process constrained by the observations. This approach allows us to follow both the course of the COVID-19 epidemic and the temporal evolution of its Reff(t). Besides, it allows to assess and to interpret the evolution of transmission with respect to the mitigation strategies implemented to control the epidemic waves in France and in Ireland. We thus can estimate a reduction of more than 80% for the first wave in all the studied regions but a smaller reduction for the second wave when the epidemic was less active. For the third wave in Ireland the reduction was again significant (>70%).

Author SummaryIn the early stages of any new epidemic, one of the first steps to design a control strategy is to estimate pathogen transmissibility in order to provide information on its potential to spread in the population. Among the different epidemiological indicators that characterize the transmissibility of a pathogen, the effective reproduction number Reff is commonly used for measuring time-varying transmissibility. It measures how many additional people can be infected by an infected individual during the course of an epidemic. However, Reff is difficult to estimate in the presence of silent transmission and/or significant temporal variation in case reporting. This is exactly the situation we are confronted with during this COVID-19 pandemic.

The statistical methods classically used for the estimation of Reff have some shortcomings in the rigorous consideration of the transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We propose here to use an original approach based on a stochastic model whose parameters vary in time and are inferred in a Bayesian framework from reliable hospital data. This enables us to reconstruct both the COVID-19 epidemic and its Reff. The Reff time evolution allows us to get information regarding the potential effects of mitigation measures taken during and between epidemics waves.

This approach, based on a stochastic model that realistically describes the hospital multiple datasets and which overcomes many of the biases associated with Reff estimates, appears to have some advantage over previously developed methods.","Cazelles, B.; Champagne, C.; Nguyen Van Yen, B.; Comiskey, C.; Vergu, E.; Roche, B.",2021-05-13,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.02.04.21251167,2,Bernard Cazelles,Sorbonne University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.04.21251167v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.04.21251167v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,"NA"

6974,Deep Transfer Learning-based COVID-19 prediction using Chest X-rays,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is spreading very rapidly across the globe because of its highly contagious nature, and is declared as a pandemic by world health organization (WHO). Scientists are endeavoring to ascertain the drugs for its efficacious treatment. Because, till now, no full-proof drug is available to cure this deadly disease. Therefore, identifying COVID-19 positive people and to quarantine them, can be an effective solution to control its spread. Many machine learning and deep learning techniques are being used quite effectively to classify positive and negative cases. In this work, a deep transfer learning-based model is proposed to classify the COVID-19 cases using chest X-rays or CT scan images of infected persons. The proposed model is based on the ensembling of DenseNet121 and SqueezeNet1.0, which is named as DeQueezeNet. The model can extract the importance of various influential features from the X-ray images, which are effectively used to classify the COVID-19 cases. The performance study of the proposed model depicts its effectiveness in terms of accuracy and precision. A comparative study has also been done with the recently published works and it is observed the performance of the proposed model is significantly better.","Kumar, S.; Mishra, S.; Singh, S.

8416,"Covid19db -- An online database of trials of medicinal products to prevent or treat COVID-19, with a specific focus on drug repurposing","BackgroundThe global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus has prompted an unprecedented international effort to seek medicines for prevention and treatment of infection. Drug repurposing has played a key part in this response. The rapid increase in trial activity has raised questions about efficiency and lack of coordination. Our objective was to develop a user-friendly, open access database to monitor and rapidly identify trials of medicinal products.

MethodsUsing the US clinicaltrials.gov (NCT) registry, the EU Clinical Trials Register (EUCTR) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), we identified all COVID-19 trials of medicinal products. Trials that were out of scope and duplicates were excluded. A manual encoding was performed to ascertain key information (e.g. trial aim, type of intervention etc). The database, Covid19db, is published online at: http://www.redo-project.org/covid19db/.

ResultsDescriptive statistics of the database from April 4th 2020 through to August 18th show an increase from 186 to 1618 trials, or an average of 10.5 new trials registered per day. Over this period, the proportion of trials including a repurposing arm decreased slightly (from a maximum of 75% to 64% at the end of the covered period) as did the proportion of trials aiming to prevent infection (from a maximum of 16% to 13%). The most popular trial intervention is hydroxychloroquine (212 trials), followed by azithromycin (64 trials), tocilizumab, favipiravir and chloroquine (145 trials). Total planned enrolment is 1064556 participants as of 18th August 2020.

Conclusionswe have developed an open access and regularly updated tool to monitor clinical trials of medicinal products to prevent or treat infection by SARS-CoV-2 globally. Our analysis shows a high number of  me-too trials, in particular for some repurposed drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and tocilizumab, substantiating calls for better coordination and better use of trial resources.","Pantziarka, P.; Vandeborne, L.; Meheus, L.; Bouche, G.",2020-08-20,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.27.20114371,2,Pan Pantziarka,Anticancer Fund,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.20114371v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.20114371v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
9748,"Risk of death by age and gender from CoVID-19 in Peru, March-May, 2020","Peru implemented strict social distancing measures during the early phase of the epidemic and is now experiencing one of the largest CoVID-19 epidemics in Latin America. Estimates of disease severity are an essential indicator to inform policy decisions about the intensity and duration of interventions needed to mitigate the outbreak. Here we derive delay-adjusted case fatality rates (aCFR) of CoVID-19 in a middle-income country in South America.

We used government-reported time series of CoVID-19 cases and deaths stratified by age group and gender.

Our estimates as of May 25, 2020, of the aCFR for men and women are 10.8% (95%CrI: 10.5-11.1%) and 6.5% (95%CrI: 6.2-6.8%), respectively, and an overall aCFR of 9.1% (95%CrI: 8.9-9.3%). Our results show that senior individuals are the most severely affected by CoVID-19, particularly men, with aCFR of almost 60% for those aged 80-years. We found that men have a significantly higher cumulative morbidity ratio than women across most age groups (proportion test, p-value< 0.001), with the exception of those aged 0-9 years.

The COVID-19 epidemic is imposing a large mortality burden in Peru. Senior individuals, especially those who are older than 70 years of age, are being disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Munayco, C.; Chowell, G.; Tariq, A.; Undurraga, E.

10874,Data From the COVID-19 Epidemic in Florida Suggest That Younger Cohorts Have Been Transmitting Their Infections to Less Socially Mobile Older Adults,"We analyzed the daily incidence of newly reported COVID-19 cases among adults aged 20-39 years, 40-59 years, and 60 or more years in the sixteen most populous counties of the state of Florida from March 1 through June 27, 2020. In all 16 counties, an increase in reported COVID-19 case incidence was observed in all three age groups soon after the governor-ordered Full Phase 1 reopening went into effect. Trends in social mobility, but not trends in testing, track case incidence. Data on hospitalization do not support the hypothesis that the observed increase in case incidence was merely the result of liberalization of testing criteria. Parameter estimates from a parsimonious two-group heterogeneous SIR model strongly support the hypothesis that younger persons, having first acquired their infections through increasing social contact with their peers, then transmitted their infections to older, less socially mobile individuals. Without such cross-infection, an isolated epidemic among older people in Florida would be unsustainable.","Harris, J.

7334,Behavioural change towards reduced intensity physical activity is disproportionately prevalent among adults with serious health issues or self-perception of high risk during the UK COVID-19 lockdown.,"ImportanceThere are growing concerns that the UK COVID-19 lockdown has reduced opportunities to maintain health through physical activity, placing individuals at higher risk of chronic disease and leaving them more vulnerable to severe sequelae of COVID-19.

ObjectiveTo examine whether the UKs lockdown measures have had disproportionate impacts on intensity of physical activity in groups who are, or who perceive themselves to be, at heightened risk from COVID-19.

Designs, Setting, ParticipantsUK-wide survey of adults aged over 20, data collected between 2020-04-06 and 2020-04-22.

ExposuresSelf-reported doctor-diagnosed obesity, hypertension, type I/II diabetes, lung disease, cancer, stroke, heart disease. Self-reported disabilities and depression. Sex, gender, educational qualifications, household income, caring for school-age children. Narrative data on coping strategies.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresChange in physical activity intensity after implementation of UK COVID-19 lockdown (self-reported).

ResultsMost (60%) participants achieved the same level of intensity of physical activity during the lockdown as before the epidemic. Doing less intensive physical activity during the lockdown was associated with obesity (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02-1.41), hypertension (OR 1.52, 1.33-1.71), lung disease (OR 1.31,1.13-1.49), depression (OR 2.02, 1.82-2.22) and disability (OR 2.34, 1.99-2.69). Participants who reduced their physical activity intensity also had higher odds of being female, living alone or having no garden, and more commonly expressed sentiments about personal or household risks in narratives on coping.

Conclusions and relevanceGroups who reduced physical activity intensity included disproportionate numbers of people with either heightened objective clinical risks or greater tendency to express subjective perceptions of risk. Policy on exercise for health during lockdowns should include strategies to facilitate health promoting levels of physical activity in vulnerable groups, including those with both objective and subjective risks.","Rogers, N.

24304,Early super-spreader events are a likely determinant of novel SARS-CoV-2 variant predominance,"The emergence of multiple new SARS-CoV-2 variants, characterized to varying degrees by increased infectivity, higher virulence and evasion of vaccine and infection-induced immunologic memory, has hampered international efforts to contain the virus. While it is generally believed that these variants first develop in single individuals with poor immunologic control of the virus, the factors governing variant predominance in the population remain poorly characterized. Here we present a mathematical framework for variant emergence accounting for the highly variable number of people secondarily infected by individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our simulations suggest that threatening new variants probably develop within infected people fairly commonly, but that most die out and do not achieve permanence in the population. Variants that predominate are more likely to be associated with higher infectiousness, but also the occurrence of a super-spreader event soon after introduction into the population.","Goyal, A.; Reeves, D.

14134,Dynamic deformable attention (DDANet) for semantic segmentation,"Deep learning based medical image segmentation is an important step within diagnosis, which relies strongly on capturing sufficient spatial context without requiring too complex models that are hard to train with limited labelled data. Training data is in particular scarce for segmenting infection regions of CT images of COVID-19 patients. Attention models help gather contextual information within deep networks and benefit semantic segmentation tasks. The recent criss-cross-attention module aims to approximate global self-attention while remaining memory and time efficient by separating horizontal and vertical selfsimilarity computations. However, capturing attention from all non-local locations can adversely impact the accuracy of semantic segmentation networks. We propose a new Dynamic Deformable Attention Network (DDANet) that enables a more accurate contextual information computation in a similarly efficient way. Our novel technique is based on a deformable criss-cross attention block that learns both attention coefficients and attention offsets in a continuous way. A deep segmentation network (in our case a U-Net [1]) that employs this attention mechanism is able to capture attention from pertinent non-local locations and also improves the performance on semantic segmentation tasks compared to criss-cross attention within a U-Net on a challenging COVID-19 lesion segmentation task. Our validation experiments show that the performance gain of the recursively applied dynamic deformable attention blocks comes from their ability to capture dynamic and precise (wider) attention context. Our DDANet achieves Dice scores of 73.4% and 61.3% for Ground-Glass-Opacity and Consolidation lesions for COVID-19 segmentation and improves the accuracy by 4.9% points compared to a baseline U-Net.","Rajamani, K.

21839,A mathematical model to estimate percentage secondary infections from margin of error of diagnostic sensitivity: Useful tool for regulatory agencies to assess the risk of propagation due to false negative outcome of diagnostics,"False negative outcome of a diagnosis is one the major reasons for the dissemination of the diseases with high risk of propagation. Diagnostic sensitivity and the margin of error determine the false negative outcome of the diagnosis. A mathematical model had been developed to estimate the mean % secondary infections based on the margin of error of diagnostic sensitivity, % prevalence and R0 value. This model recommends a diagnostic test with diagnostic sensitivity [&ge;] 96% and at least 92% lower bound limit of the 95% CI or [&le;] 4% margin of error for a highly infectious diseases like COVID-19 to curb the secondary transmission of the infection due to false negative cases. Positive relationship was found between mean % secondary infection and margin of error of sensitivity suggesting greater the margin of error of a diagnostic test sensitivity, higher the number of secondary infections in a population due to false negative cases. Negative correlation was found between number of COVID-19 test kits (>90% sensitivity) with regulatory approval and margin of error (R= -0.92, p=0.023) suggesting lesser the margin of error of a diagnostic test, higher the chances of getting approved by the regulatory agencies. However, there are no specific regulatory standards available for margin of error of the diagnostic sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnostic tests. Highly infectious disease such as COVID-19, certainly need specific regulatory standards on margin of error or 95% CI of the diagnostic sensitivity to curb the dissemination of the disease due to false negative cases and our model can be used to set the standards such as sensitivity, margin of error or lower bound limit of 95% CI.","Palavesam, A.; Kumaragurubaran, K.; R Parthiban, A.

14542,The role of asymptomatic and presymptomatic infection in SARS-CoV-2 transmission: a living systematic review,"BackgroundReports suggest that asymptomatic individuals (those with no symptoms at all throughout the infection) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are infectious, but the extent of asymptomatic transmission requires further understanding.

PurposeThis living review aims to critically appraise available data about secondary attack rates from people with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Data sourcesMedline, EMBASE, China Academic Journals full-text database (CNKI), and preprint servers were searched from 30 December 2019 to 3 July 2020 using relevant MESH terms.

Study selectionStudies that report on contact tracing of index cases with asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, in either English or Chinese were included.

Data extractionTwo authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality and risk of bias. We calculated the secondary attack rate as the number of contacts with SARS-CoV-2, divided by the number of contacts tested.

Data synthesisOf 928 studies identified, 19 were included. Secondary attack rates from asymptomatic index cases ranged from 0% to 2.8% (9 studies). Pre-symptomatic secondary attack rates ranged from 0.7% to 31.8% (10 studies). The highest secondary attack rates were found in contacts who lived in the same household as the index case. Other activities associated with transmission were group activities such as sharing meals or playing board games with the index case.

LimitationsWe excluded some studies because the index case or number of contacts were unclear. Owing to the anticipated heterogeneity, we did not produce a summary estimate of the included studies.

ConclusionAsymptomatic patients can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others, but our findings indicate that such individuals are responsible for fewer secondary infections than people with symptoms in the same studies.

13320,Effects of universal masking on Massachusetts healthcare workers' COVID-19 incidence,"BackgroundHealthcare workers (HCWs) and other essential workers are at risk for occupational infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several infection control strategies have been implemented. Particularly, evidence shows that universal masking can mitigate COVID-19 infection, though existing research is limited by secular trend bias.

AimsTo investigate the effect of hospital universal masking on COVID-19 incidence among HCWs compared to the general community population.

MethodsWe compared the 7-day averaged incidence rates between a Massachusetts (USA) healthcare system and Massachusetts residents statewide. The study period was from March 17 (the date of first incident case in the healthcare system) to May 6 (the date Massachusetts implemented public masking). The healthcare system implemented universal masking on March 26, we allotted a 5-day lag for effect onset, and peak COVID-19 incidence in Massachusetts was April 20. Thus, we categorized March 17-31 as the pre-intervention phase, April 1-20 the intervention phase, and April 21-May 6 the post-intervention phase. Temporal incidence trends (i.e. 7-day average slopes) were compared using standardized coefficients from linear regression models.

ResultsThe standardized coefficients were similar between the healthcare system and the state in both the pre- and post-intervention phases. During the intervention phase, the healthcare systems epidemic slope became negative (standardized {beta}: -0.68, 95% CI: -1.06 - -0.31), while Massachusetts slope remained positive (standardized {beta}: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.94 - 1.05).

ConclusionsUniversal masking at the healthcare system was associated with flattening the COVID-19 curve among HCWs, while the infection rate continued to rise in the surrounding community.","Lan, F.-Y.; Christophi, C.

15938,Efficacy of face-masks used in Uganda: a laboratory-based inquiry during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BackgroundWith shortages of face-masks continuing to be reported worldwide, critical questions like whether or not there is an adequate alternative to commercially manufactured face-masks continue to linger especially in low- and middle-income settings. This study aimed at addressing this through testing and comparing various materials and forms of face-masks for filtration efficiency, breathability, microbial cleanliness, distance-dependent fitness, and re-usability of different face-masks procured from face-mask vendors in Kampala, Uganda.

MethodsThis was a laboratory-based descriptive study that applied new protocols and already existing protocols with substantive modifications to ten different types of face-mask types each in quadruplicate to achieve each specified aim.

ResultsSurgical face-masks had better filtration efficiency, distance-dependent fitness and breathability compared to other face-masks tested. Decontamination of these face-masks with 70% ethanol negatively affected their efficacy. Locally-made double layered face-masks had better: filtration efficiency, distance-dependent fitness and breathability compared to other locally-made cloth face-masks, and re-usability compared to all the face-mask types that had been tested.

Discussion/conclusionsLocally-made double layered cloth face-masks could serve as alternative face-masks especially for populations in low- and middle-income settings like Uganda while allowing restricted use of surgical face-masks and other respirators like the KN95 to high-risk groups only.","Mboowa, G.; Semugenze, D.; Nakabuye, H.; Bulafu, D.; Aruhomukama, D.",2020-09-29,Health Policy,10.1101/2020.09.28.20202952,1,Dickson Aruhomukama,Makerere University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.28.20202952v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.28.20202952v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.4269/ajtmh.21-0030

9204,"Containment of future waves of COVID-19: simulating the impact of different policies and testing capacities for contact tracing, testing, and isolation","We used multi-agent simulations to estimate the testing capacity required to find and isolate a number of infections sufficient to break the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Depending on the mitigation policies in place, a daily capacity between 0.7 to 3.6 tests per thousand was required to contain the disease. However, if contact tracing and testing efficacy dropped below 60% (e.g. due to false negatives or reduced tracing capability), the number of infections kept growing exponentially, irrespective of any testing capacity. Under these conditions, the populations geographical distribution and travel behaviour could inform sampling policies to aid a successful containment.","Fiore, V. G.; Defelice, N.; Glicksberg, B.

15475,Diagnosis value of SARS-CoV-2 antigen/antibody combined testing using rapid diagnostic tests at hospital admission,"ObjectivesThe implementation of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) may enhance the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 testing, as RDTs are widely accessible and easy to use. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a diagnosis strategy based on a combination of antigen and IgM/IgG serological RDTs.

MethodsPlasma and nasopharyngeal samples were collected between 14 March and 11 April 2020 at hospital admission from 45 patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 and 20 negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 antigen (Ag) was assessed in nasopharyngeal swabs using the Coris Respi-Strip. For IgM/IgG detection, SureScreen Diagnostics and Szybio Biotech RDTs were used in addition to laboratory assays (Abbott Alinity i SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Theradiag COVID-19 IgM ELISA).

ResultsUsing the Ag RDT, 13 out of 45 (29.0%) specimens tested positive, the sensitivity was 87.0% for Cycle Threshold (CT) values [&le;] 25 and 0% for CT values > 25. IgG detection was associated with high CT values and the amount of time after the onset of symptoms. The profile of isolated IgM on RDTs was more frequently observed during the first and second week after the onset of symptoms. The combination of Ag and IgM/IgG RDTs enabled the detection of up to 84.0% of COVID-19 confirmed cases at hospital admission.

ConclusionAntigen and antibody-based RDTs showed suboptimal performances when used alone. However when used in combination, they are able to identify most COVID-19 patients admitted in an emergency department.","Veyrenche, N.; Bollore, K.; Pisoni, A.; Bedin, A.-S.; Mondain, A.-M.; Ducos, J.; Segondy, M.; Montes, B.; Pastor, P.; Morquin, D.; Makinson, A.; Le Moing, V.; Van De Perre, P.; Foulongne, V.; Tuaillon, E.",2020-09-28,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.09.19.20197855,2,Nicolas Veyrenche,Montpellier University Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.19.20197855v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.19.20197855v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1002/jmv.26855
17024,Modifiable lifestyle factors and severe COVID-19 risk: Evidence from Mendelian randomization analysis,"BackgroundLifestyle factors including obesity and smoking are suggested to be related to increased risk of COVID-19 severe illness or related death. However, little is known about whether these relationships are causal, or the relationships between COVID-19 severe illness and other lifestyle factors, such as alcohol consumption and physical activity.

MethodsGenome-wide significant genetic variants associated with body mass index (BMI), lifetime smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity identified by large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were selected as instrumental variables. GWAS summary statistics of these genetic variants for relevant lifestyle factors and severe illness of COVID-19 were obtained. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted.

ResultsBoth genetically predicted BMI and lifetime smoking were associated with about 2-fold increased risks of severe respiratory COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospitalization (all P<0.05). Genetically predicted physical activity was associated with about 5-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4, 20.3; P=0.02) decreased risk of severe respiratory COVID-19, but not with COVID-19 hospitalization, though the majority of the 95% CI did not include one. No evidence of association was found for genetically predicted alcohol consumption, but associations were found when using pleiotropy robust methods.

ConclusionEvidence is found that BMI and smoking causally increase and physical activity causally decreases the risk of COVID-19 severe illness. This study highlights the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle in protecting from COVID-19 severe illness and its public health value in fighting against COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, S.",2020-10-21,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.10.19.20215525,1,Shuai Li,The University of Melbourne,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.20215525v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.20215525v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1186/s12920-021-00887-1
12831,The association between COVID-19-imposed lockdowns and online searches for toothache using Google Trends,"ObjectiveTo assess the association between the lockdowns due to COVID-19 and global online searches for toothache using Google Trends (GT).

MethodsWe investigated GT online searches for the search terms """"toothache"""" and """"tooth pain"""", within the past five years. The time frame for data gathering was considered as the initiation and end dates of national/regional lockdowns in each country. Relative search volumes (RSVs) for online Google Search queries in 2019 was considered as the control. We analysed data after normalising based on the Internet penetration rate. We used one-way ANOVA to identify statistical difference for RSVs between 2020 and 2016-2019 for each country. A linear regression model was used to assess whether there is a correlation between RSVs in 2020 and gross domestic production, COVID-19 deaths, dentists density, YLDs of oral conditions, Internet access, lockdown duration, Education Index, and dental expenditure per capita.

ResultsThe results of worldwide RSVs for toothache and tooth pain also showed significantly higher values in 2020 compared to the previous four years. Of 23 included countries in our study, 16 showed significantly increased RSVs during the lockdown period compared to the same periods in the past four years. There was a statistically significant relationship between difference of RSVs means in 2020 and in 2016-2019 combined with percent of urban residency (B=-1.82; 95% CI: (-3.38, -0.26); p=0.026) and dental expenditure per capita (B=-0.42; 95% CI: (-0.80, -0.05); p=0.031) (R2=0.66).

ConclusionGenerally, the interest in toothache and tooth pain has significantly increased in 2020 compared to the last four years. This could implicitly reinforce the importance of dental care, as urgent medical care worldwide. Governments expenditure on oral healthcare and the rate of urban residency, could be mentioned as important factors to direct general populations online care-seeking behaviour with regard to dental pain.","Sofi-Mahmudi, A.; Shamsoddin, E.; Ghasemi, P.; Nasser, M.; Mesgarpour, B.",2020-08-04,Dentistry And Oral Medicine,10.1101/2020.08.01.20157065,1,Erfan Shamsoddin,"National Institute for Medical Research Development (NIMAD), Tehran, Iran.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.01.20157065v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.01.20157065v1.full.pdf,cc_by,"NA"
4357,"Clinical characteristics of 34 COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU in Hangzhou, China","IntroductionThe purpose of the study was to summarize the clinical and laboratory characteristics of the coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted to intensive care unit.

MethodsWe tracked the data until March 5, 2020. The cases in our cohort were divided into cases only received noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and cases required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The characteristics between the two groups were compared.

Results34 cases were included in the study. The complications rate (including, acute liver injury, acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury) were higher in IMV cases. Lymphocytopenia and neutrophilia occurred in most cases in both groups on the admission day, however, lymphocyte levels dropped progressively and more severe lymphopenia occurred in IMV group. Increased amounts of plasma IL-6 and IL-10 were found in both groups on the admission day, the progressive decrease of which occurred in NIV cases rather than IMV cases, and the levels were higher in IMV cases during hospitalization.

ConclusionsLymphocytopenia, neutrophilia, and increase of IL-6 and IL-10 occurred in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in ICU, however, the dynamics of those were significantly different in IMV cases and NIV cases during hospitalization.","Zheng, Y.; Sun, L.; Xu, M.; Pan, J.; Zhang, Y.; Fang, X.; Fang, Q.; Cai, H.",2020-04-15,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.12.20062604,1,Hongliu Cai,"The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.12.20062604v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.12.20062604v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1631/jzus.b2000174
7878,Visualizing the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh using coxcombs: A tribute to Florence Nightingale,"Following detection of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in early December 2019 in Wuhan, China, nearly six months have passed and almost every country in the world is battling against the COVID-19 war. The frontline warriors, namely the doctors, nurses and healthcare staff, have in many countries struggled to care for the sick under conditions of limited resources and protection and the threat of an overwhelmed healthcare system. It is during times such as this, that we draw strength and inspiration from Florence Nightingale - a passionate statistician, social reformer, feminist champion and a pioneer of modern nursing and data visualization. Nightingales famed Florence Night-ingle Diagram also known as """"coxcomb"""", which was created 150 years ago and used to display the causes of death in the British Army hospital barracks, demonstrated how data visualization techniques could be a powerful medium of communication and a force for change. This paper pays tribute to Nightingales work by using data from Bangladesh to show that the coxcomb graph is still relevant in the era of COVID-19. The coxcomb graphs that have been produced to display COVID-19 data have provided deeper insights into the trends and relative changes of variables over the course of the pandemic. The paper also describes codes that allow one to easily reproduce the graphs using the statistical programming language R.","Rahaman Khan, H.; Howlader, T.",2020-05-24,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.23.20110866,1,Hasinur Rahaman Khan,"University of Dhaka, Bangladesh",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.23.20110866v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.23.20110866v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,"NA"
19706,"Social and racial inequalities in COVID-19 risk of hospitalisation and death across Sao Paulo state, Brazil","BackgroundLittle evidence exists on the differential health effects of COVID-19 on disadvantaged population groups. Here we characterise the differential risk of hospitalisation and death in Sao Paulo state, Brazil and show how vulnerability to COVID-19 is shaped by socioeconomic inequalities.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study using hospitalised severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) notified from March to August 2020, in the Sistema de Monitoramento Inteligente de Sao Paulo (SIMI-SP) database. We examined the risk of hospitalisation and death by race and socioeconomic status using multiple datasets for individual-level and spatio-temporal analyses. We explained these inequalities according to differences in daily mobility from mobile phone data, teleworking behaviour, and comorbidities.

FindingsThroughout the study period, patients living in the 40% poorest areas were more likely to die when compared to patients living in the 5% wealthiest areas (OR: 1{middle dot}60, 95% CI: 1{middle dot}48 - 1{middle dot}74) and were more likely to be hospitalised between April and July, 2020 (OR: 1{middle dot}08, 95% CI: 1{middle dot}04 - 1{middle dot}12). Black and Pardo individuals were more likely to be hospitalised when compared to White individuals (OR: 1{middle dot}37, 95% CI: 1{middle dot}32 - 1{middle dot}41; OR: 1{middle dot}23, 95% CI: 1{middle dot}21 - 1{middle dot}25, respectively), and were more likely to die (OR: 1{middle dot}14, 95% CI: 1{middle dot}07 - 1{middle dot}21; 1{middle dot}09, 95% CI: 1{middle dot}05 - 1{middle dot}13, respectively).

InterpretationLow-income and Black and Pardo communities are more likely to die with COVID-19. This is associated with differential access to healthcare, adherence to social distancing, and the higher prevalence of comorbidities.

5370,Resilient SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics workflows including viral heat inactivation,"There is a worldwide need for reagents to perform SARS-CoV-2 detection. Some laboratories have implemented kit-free protocols, but many others do not have the capacity to develop these and/or perform manual processing. We provide multiple workflows for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection in clinical samples by comparing several commercially available RNA extraction methods: QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAgen), RNAdvance Blood/Viral (Beckman) and Mag-Bind Viral DNA/RNA 96 Kit (Omega Bio-tek). We also compared One-step RT-qPCR reagents: TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (FastVirus, ThermoFisher Scientific), qPCRBIO Probe 1-Step Go Lo-ROX (PCR Biosystems) and Luna(R) Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (Luna, NEB). We used primer-probes that detect viral N (EUA CDC) and RdRP (PHE guidelines). All RNA extraction methods provided similar results. FastVirus and Luna proved most sensitive. N detection was more reliable than that of RdRP, particularly in samples with low viral titres. Importantly, we demonstrate that treatment of nasopharyngeal swabs with 70 degrees for 10 or 30 min, or 90 degrees for 10 or 30 min (both original variant and B 1.1.7) inactivates SARS-CoV-2 employing plaque assays, and that it has minimal impact on the sensitivity of the qPCR in clinical samples.

13727,"Keep calm and carry on: safety, feasibility and early outcomes of head and neck cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic","BackgroundPatients with cancer are considered at higher risk of COVID-19 infection and increased severity of infection. Anti-cancer treatment may further increase those risks.

The aim of this work is to report early outcomes in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) treated during the pandemic.

Materials and MethodsA retrospective cohort study in a UK tertiary level oncology centre between 1st March and 23 June 2020, including patients with HNC who were either newly diagnosed, had developed new recurrent/metastatic disease, or were already scheduled to receive treatment during that period.

Results200 patients were evaluated. Median age was 64 years, 65.5% had multiple co-morbidities, 77.5% were current or ex-smokers and 59.5% lived in areas of deprivation. 99 patients were treated with 6 weeks of radical (chemo) radiotherapy. Systemic anti-cancer treatment was delivered to 40 patients.

2 (1.0%) patients with HNC had confirmed COVID-19 infection; 1 patient prior to primary radical RT - no delay to treatment was required and RT was completed as planned, 1 patient acquired COVID-19 after primary surgery but recovered well and started adjuvant RT 9.7 weeks after surgery.

The proportion of patients receiving supportive care only (19.5%) was in keeping with that pre-COVID-19. The proportion of patients not completing (chemo) radiotherapy (3.4%) or with gaps in treatment (14.1%) was similar to pre-COVID-19. 30-day mortality after radical (chemo)radiotherapy was 2.3%, no higher than in previous years.

ConclusionsIt is feasible and safe to deliver standard treatment for patients with HNC during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Walker, S.; Thomson, M. C.; Campbell, F.; Hay, L.

21456,Rule of thumb in human intelligence for assessing the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 outbreak in Japan exhibited its third peak at the end of 2020. Mathematical modelling and developed AI cannot explain several peaks in a single year.

ObjectThis study was conducted to evaluate a rule of thumb for prediction from past wave experiences.

MethodWe rescaled the number of newly infected patients as 100% at the peak and checked similarities among waves. Then we extrapolated the courses of the third and later waves.

ResultsResults show some similarity around the second and the third waves. Based on this similarity, we expected the bottom of the third wave will show 2131 newly positive patients including asymptomatic patients at around the end of February, 2021.

Discussion and ConclusionWe can infer the course of the third wave from similarity with the second wave. Mathematical modelling has been unable to do it, even when AI was used for prediction.

18645,"Is Standard Personal Protective Equipment Effective Enough To Prevent COVID-19 Transmission During Aerosol Generating Dental, Oral and Maxillofacial Procedures ? A Systematic Review","A systematic review was performed to answer the following questions: 1) Do dental, oral and maxillofacial (OMF) surgical procedures generate bioaerosols (and if so, which ones), which can result in transmission of COVID-19?; 2) Are aerosolized airborne droplets (and to which extent is splatter) in dental and OMF procedures infective?; 3) Is enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) an essential to prevent spreading of COVID-19 during dental and OMF aerosol generating procedures (AGPs)? Authors performed a systematic review to retrieve all pertinent literature that assessed effectiveness of surgical mask vs respirators for protecting dental health care workers during dental and OMF AGPs surgical procedures. Additionally, studies which assessed potential aerosolization during dental, OMF and orthopaedic surgeries were retrieved. There is moderate evidence showing that ultrasonic scaling and bone drilling using high speed rotary instruments produces respirable aerosols. Additionally, there is very weak/inconclusive evidence to support the creation of infectious aerosols during dental procedures. According to available very weak/inconclusive evidence, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via infective aerosol during AGPS, so far, must remain speculative and controversial. As, however, this is a probable opportunistic way of transmission which at least cannot be sufficiently excluded and therefore should not be dismissed out of hand prematurely, proper and equally important properly applied protective equipment (i.e., N95 respirators or FFP-2 masksv or above regarding mouth and nose protection) should always be used during AGPs.","Al-Moraissi, E.

8138,Eruption of COVID-19 like illness in a remote village in Papua (Indonesia),"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic is creating significant challenges for healthcare infrastructure for countries of all development and resource levels. Low-and-middle resource countries face even larger challenges, as their resources are stretched and often insufficient under normal circumstances. A village in the Papuan highlands of Indonesia; small, isolated, accessed only by small plane or trekking has experienced an outbreak typical of COVID-19.

Methodology/Principal FindingsThis description was compiled from patient care records by lay healthcare workers in M20 (a pseudonym) during and after an outbreak and from medical doctors responding to online requests for help. We assume that, for reasons given, the outbreak that has been described was COVID-19. The dense social structure of the village resulted in a rapid infection of 90-95% of the population. Physical distancing and isolation measures were used, but probably implemented suboptimal and too late, and their effect on the illness course was unclear. The relatively young population, with a majority of women, probably influenced the impact of the epidemic, resulting in only two deaths so far.

Conclusions/SignificanceThis outbreak pattern of suspected SARS-CoV-2 in a village in the highlands of Papua (Indonesia) presents a unique report of the infection of an entire village population over five weeks. The age distribution, common in Papuan highland villages may have reduced case fatality rate (CFR) in this context and that might be the case in similar remote areas since survival to old age is already very limited and CFR among younger people is lower.

Author summaryA village in the Papuan highlands of Indonesia; small, isolated, accessed only by small plane or trekking has experienced an outbreak typical of COVID-19. The outbreak affected 90-95% of approximately 200 residents between 20 February 2020 and 31 March 2020. Lay health workers, consisting of trained local volunteers, without healthcare facilities and limited medication options reached out for help online and managed with what they had available. Their experience is relevant to others in similar settings. This report describes the village, outbreak, timeline, symptoms and treatments, and outcomes.","Van Burg, E.; Van Burg-Verhage, W.",2020-05-26,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.19.20106740,1,Elco Van Burg,Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20106740v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20106740v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
4950,Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic: An Overview of Systematic Reviews,"BackgroundNavigating the rapidly growing body of scientific literature on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is challenging and ongoing critical appraisal of this output is essential. We aimed to collate and summarize all published systematic reviews on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

MethodsNine databases (Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Sciences, PDQ-Evidence, WHOs Global Research, LILACS and Epistemonikos) were searched from December 1, 2019 to March 24, 2020. Systematic reviews analyzing primary studies of COVID-19 were included. Two authors independently undertook screening, selection, extraction (data on clinical symptoms, prevalence, pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, diagnostic test assessment, laboratory and radiological findings) and quality assessment (AMSTAR 2). Meta-analysis on prevalence of clinical outcomes was performed.

ResultsEighteen systematic reviews were included; one was empty. Using AMSTAR 2, confidence in the results of 13 reviews was rated as """"critically low"""", one as """"low"""", one as """"moderate"""" and two as """"high"""". Symptoms of COVID-19 were (range values of point estimates): fever (82-95%), cough with or without sputum (58-72%), dyspnea (26-59%), myalgia or muscle fatigue (29-51%), sore throat (10-13%), headache (8- 12%) and gastrointestinal complaints (5-9%). Severe symptoms were more common in men. Elevated C-reactive protein (associated with lymphocytopenia) and lactate dehydrogenase, and slightly elevated aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, were commonly described. Thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of procalcitonin and cardiac troponin I were associated with severe disease. Chest imaging described a frequent pattern of uni- or bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity. Only one review investigated the impact of medication (chloroquine) but found no verifiable clinical data. All-cause mortality ranged from 0.3% to 14%.

ConclusionsConfidence in the results of most reviews was """"critically low"""". Future studies and systematic reviews should adhere to established methodologies. The majority of included systematic reviews were hampered by imprecise search strategy and no previous protocol submission.

24570,"Estimating COVID-19 cases and deaths prevented by non-pharmaceutical interventions, and the impact of individual actions: a retrospective model-based analysis","Simulation models from the early COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the urgency of applying non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), but had limited empirical data. Here we use data from 2020-2021 to retrospectively model the impact of NPIs in Ontario, Canada. Our model represents age groups and census divisions in Ontario, and is parameterised with epidemiological, testing, demographic, travel, and mobility data. The model captures how individuals adopt NPIs in response to reported cases. We compare a scenario representing NPIs introduced within Ontario (closures of workplaces/schools, reopening of schools/workplaces with NPIs in place, individual-level NPI adherence) to counterfactual scenarios wherein alternative strategies (e.g. no closures, reliance on individual NPI adherence) are adopted to ascertain the extent to which NPIs reduced cases and deaths. Combined school/workplace closure and individual NPI adoption reduced the number of deaths in the best-case scenario for the case fatality rate (CFR) from 178548 [CI: 171845, 185298] to 3190 [CI: 3095, 3290] in the Spring 2020 wave. In the Fall 2020/Winter 2021 wave, the introduction of NPIs in workplaces/schools reduced the number of deaths from 20183 [CI: 19296, 21057] to 4102 [CI: 4075, 4131]. Deaths were several times higher in the worst-case CFR scenario. Each additional 9-16 (resp. 285-578) individuals who adopted NPIs in the first wave prevented one additional infection (resp., death). Our results show that the adoption of NPIs prevented a public health catastrophe. A less comprehensive approach, employing only closures or individual-level NPI adherence, would have resulted in a large number of cases and deaths.","Fair, K.; Karatayev, V.; Anand, M.; Bauch, C.",2021-06-24,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.03.26.21254421,3,Kathyrn Fair,University of Guelph,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.26.21254421v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.26.21254421v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
2555,Heat inactivation of serum interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2,"The detection of serum antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is emerging as a new tool for the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis. Since many coronaviruses are sensitive to heat, heating inactivation of samples at 56 {degrees}C prior to testing is considered a possible method to reduce the risk of transmission, but the effect of heating on the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is still unclear. By comparing the levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation of serum at 56 {degrees}C for 30 minutes using a quantitative fluorescence immunochromatographic assay, we shown that heat inactivation significantly interferes with the levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The IgM levels of all the 34 serum samples (100%) from COVID-19 patients decreased by an average level of 53.56%. The IgG levels were decreased in 22 of 34 samples (64.71%) by an average level of 49.54%. Similar changes can also be observed in the non-COVID-19 diseases group (n=9). Of note, 44.12% of the detected IgM levels were dropped below the cut-off value after heating, suggesting heat inactivation can lead to false-negative results of these samples. Our results indicate that heat inactivation of serum at 56 {degrees}C for 30 minutes interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Heat inactivation prior to immunoanalysis is not recommended and the possibility of false-negative results should be considered if the sample was pre-inactivated by heating.","Hu, X.; An, T.; Situ, B.; Hu, Y.; Ou, Z.; Li, Q.; He, X.; Zhang, Y.; Tian, P.; Sun, D.; Rui, Y.; Wang, Q.; Ding, D.; Zheng, L.",2020-03-16,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.12.20034231,1,Lei Zheng,"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University.

25433,Cyclooxygenase inhibitor use is associated with increased COVID-19 severity,"BACKGROUNDCyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation but have been associated with complications in community acquired pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Conclusive data are not available about potential beneficial or adverse effects of COX inhibitors on COVID-19 patients.

METHODSWe conducted a retrospective, multi-center observational study by leveraging the harmonized, high-granularity electronic health record data of the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). Potential associations of eight COX inhibitors with COVID-19 severity were assessed using ordinal logistic regression (OLR) on treatment with the medication in question after matching by treatment propensity as predicted by age, race, ethnicity, gender, smoking status, comorbidities, and BMI. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to estimate the correlation of medication use with morbidity for eight subcohorts defined by common indications for COX inhibitors.

RESULTSOLR revealed statistically significant associations between use of any of five COX inhibitors and increased severity of COVID-19. For instance, the odds ratio of aspirin use in the osteoarthritis cohort (n=2266 patients) was 3.25 (95% CI 2.76 - 3.83). Aspirin and acetaminophen were associated with increased mortality.

CONCLUSIONSThe association between use of COX inhibitors and COVID-19 severity was consistent across five COX inhibitors and multiple indication subcohorts. Our results align with earlier reports associating NSAID use with complications in RTI patients. Further research is needed to characterize the precise risk of individual COX inhibitors in COVID-19 patients.","Reese, J.; Coleman, B.; Chan, L.; Callahan, T.

20759,High prevalence of long-term psychophysical olfactory dysfunction in patients with COVID-19,"This study prospectively assessed the long-term prevalence of self-reported and psychophysically measured olfactory dysfunction in subjects with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Self-reported smell or taste impairment was prospectively evaluated by SNOT-22 at diagnosis, 4-week, 8-week, and 6-month. At 6 months from the diagnosis, psychophysical evaluation of olfactory function was also performed using the 34-item culturally adapted University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (CA-UPSIT). 145 completed both the 6-month subjective and psychophysical olfactory evaluation. According to CA-UPSIT, 87 subjects (60.0%) exhibited some smell dysfunction, with 54 (37.2) being mildly microsmic, 16 (11.0%) moderately microsmic, 7 (4.8%) severely microsmic, and 10 patients (6.9%) being anosmic. At the time CA-UPSIT was administered, a weak correlation was observed between the self-reported alteration of sense of smell or taste and olfactory test scores (Spearmans r=-0.26). Among 112 patients who self-reported normal sense of smell at last follow-up, CA-UPSIT revealed normal smell in 46 (41.1%), mild microsmia in 46 (41.1%), moderate microsmia in 11 (9.8%), severe microsmia in 3 (2.3%), and anosmia in 6 (5.4%) patients; however, of those patients self-reporting normal smell but who were found to have hypofunction on testing, 62 out of 66 had self-reported reduction in sense of smell or taste at an earlier time point. Despite most patients report a subjectively normal sense of smell, we observed a high percentage of persistent smell dysfunction at 6 months from the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with 11.7% of patients being anosmic or severely microsmic. These data highlight a significant long-term rate of smell alteration in patients with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Boscolo-Rizzo, P.; Menegaldo, A.; Fabbris, C.; Spinato, G.; Borsetto, D.; Vaira, L.

24546,Disparities in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among individuals presenting for care in central North Carolina over a six-month period,"BackgroundRobust community-level SARS-CoV-2 prevalence estimates have been difficult to obtain in the American South and outside of major metropolitan areas. Furthermore, though some previous studies have investigated the association of demographic factors such as race with SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk, fewer have correlated exposure risk to surrogates for socioeconomic status such as health insurance coverage.

MethodsWe used a highly specific serological assay utilizing the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein to identify SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in remnant blood samples collected by the University of North Carolina Health system. We estimated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in this cohort with Bayesian regression, as well as the association of critical demographic factors with higher prevalence odds.

FindingsBetween April 21st and October 3rd of 2020, a total of 9,624 unique samples were collected from clinical sites in central NC and we observed a seroprevalence increase from 2{middle dot}9 (1{middle dot}7, 4{middle dot}3) to 9{middle dot}1 (7{middle dot}2, 11{middle dot}1) over the study period. Individuals who identified as Latinx were associated with the highest odds ratio of SARS-CoV-2 exposure at 7{middle dot}77 overall (5{middle dot}20, 12{middle dot}10). Increased odds were also observed among Black individuals and individuals without public or private health insurance.

InterpretationOur data suggests that for this care-accessing cohort, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was significantly higher than cumulative total cases reported for the study geographical area six months into the COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina. The increased odds of seropositivity by ethnoracial grouping as well as health insurance highlights the urgent and ongoing need to address underlying health and social disparities in these populations.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for studies published through March 21st, 2021. We used search terms that included """"COVID-19"""", """"SARS-CoV-2"""", """"prevalence"""" and """"seroprevalence"""". Our search resulted in 399 papers, from which we identified 58 relevant studies describing SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence at sites around the United States from March 1 to December 9, 2020, 12 of which utilized remnant clinical samples and three of which overlapped with our study area. Most notably, one study of 4,422 asymptomatic inpatients and outpatients in central NC from April 28-June 19, 2020 found an estimated seroprevalence of 0{middle dot}7 -0{middle dot}8%, and another study of 177,919 inpatients and outpatients (3,817 from NC) from July 27-September 24, 2020 found an estimated seroprevalence of 2{middle dot}5 -6{middle dot}8%.

Added value of this studyThis is the largest SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence cohort published to date in NC. Importantly, we used a Bayesian framework to account for uncertainty in antibody assay sensitivity and specificity and investigated seropositivity by important demographic variables that have not yet been studied in this context in NC. This study corroborates other reports that specific demographic factors including race, ethnicity and the lack of public or private insurance are associated with elevated risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, in a subset of serum samples, we identify other SARS-CoV-2 antibodies elicited by these individuals, including functionally neutralizing antibodies.

Implications of all the available evidenceIt is difficult to say the exact seroprevalence in the central North Carolina area, but a greater proportion of the population accessing healthcare has been infected by SARS-CoV-2 than is reflected by infection cases confirmed by molecular testing. Furthermore, local governments need to prioritize addressing the many forms of systemic racism and socioeconomic disadvantage that drive SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk, such as residential and occupational risk, and an urgent need to provide access to SARS-CoV-2 testing and vaccination to these groups.","Lopez, C.

10943,Navigating hospitals safely through the COVID-19 epidemic tide: predicting case load for adjusting bed capacity,"BackgroundThe pressures exerted by the pandemic of COVID-19 pose an unprecedented demand on health care services. Hospitals become rapidly overwhelmed when patients requiring life-saving support outpace available capacities. We here describe methods used by a university hospital to forecast caseloads and time to peak incidence.

MethodsWe developed a set of models to forecast incidence among the hospital catchment population and describe the COVID-19 patient hospital care-path. The first forecast utilized data from antecedent allopatric epidemics and parameterized the care path model according to expert opinion (static model). Once sufficient local data were available, trends for the time dependent effective reproduction number were fitted and the care-path was parameterized using hazards for real patient admission, referrals, and discharge (dynamic model).

ResultsThe static model, deployed before the epidemic, exaggerated the bed occupancy (general wards 116 forecasted vs 66 observed, ICU 47 forecasted vs 34 observed) and predicted the peak too late (general ward forecast April 9, observed April 8, ICU forecast April 19, observed April 8). After April 5, the dynamic model could be run daily and precision improved with increasing availability of empirical local data.

ConclusionsThe models provided data-based guidance in the preparation and allocation of critical resources of a university hospital well in advance of the epidemic surge, despite overestimating the service demand. Overestimates should resolve when population contact pattern before and during restrictions can be taken into account, but for now they may provide an acceptable safety margin for preparing during times of uncertainty.","Donker, T.; Bürkin, F.; Wolkewitz, M.; Haverkamp, C.; Christoffel, D.; Kappert, O.; Hammer, T.; Busch, H.-J.; Biever, P.; Kalbhenn, J.; Bürkle, H.; Kern, W.; Wenz, F.; Grundmann, H.",2020-07-03,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.02.20143206,1,Tjibbe Donker,University Medical Center Freiburg,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20143206v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20143206v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1017/ice.2020.464
14637,The role of school reopening in the spread of COVID-19,"Many countries chose to close schools as part of their response to the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Whilst nations are gradually reopening schools, and many politicians advise that schools remain safe and the risks of increases in the spread of COVID-19 are low, little evidence has been presented to confirm those statements.

A review of the numbers of new confirmed COVID-19 cases by country suggests that the reopening of schools is likely to be a driver in the increase of the number of new cases. This is likely exacerbated by accompanying changes and easing of restrictions. However, with the exception of China, notable for its robust test, track, trace, and isolate processes, no other countries that had significant numbers of COVID-19 cases have successfully reopened schools without an increase in cases as a consequence.

Whilst reopening of schools following an initial peak and decrease in COVID-19 infections is desirable for a range of reasons, doing so without adequate controls and protections may lead to an exacerbation of spread within the school environment, which could then lead to increased community spread of disease.","Beesley, R.",2020-09-05,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.09.03.20187757,2,Richard Beesley,Juvenile Arthritis Research,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.20187757v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.20187757v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
7265,Progression of COVID-19 in Indian States - Forecasting Endpoints Using SIR and Logistic Growth Models,"COVID-19 has led to the most widespread public health crisis in recent history. The first case of the disease was detected in India on 31 January 2019, and confirmed cases stand at 74,281 as of 13 May 2020. Mathematical modeling can be utilized to forecast the final numbers as well as the endpoint of the disease in India and its states, as well as assess the impact of social distancing measures. In the present work, the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and the Logistic Growth model have been implemented to predict the endpoint of COVID-19 in India as well as three states accounting for over 55% of the total cases - Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi. The results using the SIR model indicate that the disease will reach an endpoint in India on 12 September, while Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi will reach endpoints on 20 August, 30 July and 9 September respectively. Using the Logistic Regression model, the endpoint for India is predicted on 23 July, while that for Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi is 5 July, 23 June and 10 August respectively. It is also observed that the case numbers predicted by the SIR model are greater than those for the Logistic Growth model in each case. The results suggest that the lockdown enacted by the Government of India has had only a moderate impact on the spread of COVID-19, and emphasize the need for firm implementation of social distancing guidelines.","Malhotra, B.; Kashyap, V.",2020-05-18,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.15.20103028,1,Vishesh Kashyap,Delhi Technological University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.15.20103028v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.15.20103028v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
4426,Long-term Coexistence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with Antibody Response in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Patients,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection causing coronavirus disease 2019 has spread worldwide. Whether antibodies are important for the adaptive immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection needs to be determined. Here, 26 cases of COVID-19 in Jinan, China, were examined and shown to be mild or with common clinical symptoms and no cases of severe symptoms were found among these patients. A striking feature of some patients is that SARS-CoV-2 could exist in patients who have virus-specific IgG antibodies for a very long period, with two cases for up to 50 days. One COVID-19 patient who did not produce any SARS-CoV-2-bound IgG successfully cleared SARS-CoV-2 after 46 days of illness, revealing that without antibody-mediated adaptive immunity, innate immunity may still be powerful enough to eliminate SARS-CoV-2. Overall, this report may provide a basis for further analysis of both innate and adaptive immunity in SARS-CoV-2 clearance, especially in non-severe cases. This study also has implications for understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.","Wang, B.; Wang, L.; Kong, X.; Geng, J.; Xiao, D.; Ma, C.; Jiang, X.; Wang, P.-H.",2020-04-21,Allergy And Immunology,10.1101/2020.04.13.20040980,2,Xuemei Jiang,"Jinan Infectious Diseases Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250021, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.20040980v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.20040980v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
27941,Public health relevant consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on malaria in sub-Saharan Africa: A scoping review,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented challenges to health systems worldwide, including the control of non-COVID-19 diseases. Malaria cases and deaths may increase due to the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic in malaria endemic countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).

ObjectivesThis scoping review aims to summarize information on public health relevant effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the malaria situation in SSA.

MethodsReview of publications and manuscripts on preprint servers, in peer-reviewed journals and in grey literature documents from December 1, 2019, to June 9, 2021. A structured search was conducted on different databases using predefined eligibility criteria for the selection of articles.

ResultsA total of 51 papers have been included in the analysis. Modeling papers have predicted a significant increase in malaria cases and malaria deaths in SSA due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many papers provided potential explanations for expected COVID-19 effects on the malaria burden; these ranged from relevant diagnostic and clinical aspects, to reduced access to health care services, impaired availability of curative and preventive commodities and medications, and effects on malaria prevention campaigns. Compared to previous years, fewer country reports provided data on the actual number of malaria cases and deaths in 2020, with mixed results. While highly endemic countries reported evidence of decreased malaria cases in health facilities, low endemic countries reported an overall higher numbers of malaria cases and deaths in 2020.

ConclusionsThe findings from this review provide evidence for a significant but diverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on malaria in SSA. There is the need to further investigate the public health consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on the malaria burden.

10868,"Diverse local epidemics reveal the distinct effects of population density, demographics, climate, depletion of susceptibles, and intervention in the first wave of COVID-19 in the United States","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused significant mortality and morbidity worldwide, sparing almost no community. As the disease will likely remain a threat for years to come, an understanding of the precise influences of human demographics and settlement, as well as the dynamic factors of climate, susceptible depletion, and intervention, on the spread of localized epidemics will be vital for mounting an effective response. We consider the entire set of local epidemics in the United States; a broad selection of demographic, population density, and climate factors; and local mobility data, tracking social distancing interventions, to determine the key factors driving the spread and containment of the virus. Assuming first a linear model for the rate of exponential growth (or decay) in cases/mortality, we find that population-weighted density, humidity, and median age dominate the dynamics of growth and decline, once interventions are accounted for. A focus on distinct metropolitan areas suggests that some locales benefited from the timing of a nearly simultaneous nationwide shutdown, and/or the regional climate conditions in mid-March; while others suffered significant outbreaks prior to intervention. Using a first-principles model of the infection spread, we then develop predictions for the impact of the relaxation of social distancing and local climate conditions. A few regions, where a significant fraction of the population was infected, show evidence that the epidemic has partially resolved via depletion of the susceptible population (i.e., """"herd immunity""""), while most regions in the United States remain overwhelmingly susceptible. These results will be important for optimal management of intervention strategies, which can be facilitated using our online dashboard.","Afshordi, N.; Holder, B.; Bahrami, M.; Lichtblau, D.",2020-07-02,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.30.20143636,1,Niayesh Afshordi,University of Waterloo,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.20143636v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.20143636v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,"NA"

23806,Magnesium Treatment on Methylation Changes of Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2),"BackgroundThe viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 requires host-expressed TMPRSS2 to facilitate the viral spike (S) protein priming.

ObjectivesTo test the hypothesis that Mg treatment leads to DNA methylation changes in TMPRSS2.

MethodsThis study is nested within the Personalized Prevention of Colorectal Cancer Trial (PPCCT), a double-blind 2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial, which enrolled 250 participants from Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Target doses for both Mg and placebo arms were personalized.

ResultsWe found that 12-week of personalized Mg treatment significantly increased 5-mC methylation at cg16371860 (TSS1500, promoter) by 7.2% compared to placebo arm (decreased by 0.1%) in those aged < 65 years old. The difference remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, sex and baseline methylation as well as FDR correction (FDR-adjusted P =0.014). Additionally, Mg treatment significantly reduced 5-hmC level at cg26337277 (close proximity to TSS200 and 5UTR, promoter) by 2.3% compared to increases by 7.1% in the placebo arm after adjusting for covariates in those aged < 65 years old (P=0.003). The effect remained significant at FDR of 0.10 (adjusted P value=0.088).

ConclusionAmong individuals aged younger than 65 years with the Ca:Mg intake ratios equal to or over 2.6, reducing Ca:Mg ratios to around 2.3 increased 5-mC modifications (i.e. cg16371860) and reduced 5-hmC modifications (i.e. cg26337277) in the TMPRSS2 gene. These findings, if confirmed, provide another mechanism for the role of Mg intervention for the prevention of COVID-19 and treatment of early and mild disease by modifying the phenotype of the TMPRSS2 genotype.","Fan, L.; Zhu, X.; Zheng, Y.; Zhang, W.; Seidner, D.

13523,Examining face-mask usage as an effective strategy to control COVID-19 spread,"COVID-19s high virus transmission rates have caused a pandemic that is exacerbated by the high rates of asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections. These factors suggest that face masks and social distance could be paramount in containing the pandemic. We examined the efficacy of each measure and the combination of both measures using an agent-based model within a closed space that approximated real-life interactions. By explicitly considering different fractions of asymptomatic individuals, as well as a realistic hypothesis of face masks protection during inhaling and exhaling, our simulations demonstrate that a synergistic use of face masks and social distancing is the most effective intervention to curb the infection spread. To control the pandemic, we show that practicing social distance is less efficacious than the widespread usage of face masks and that wearing face masks provides optimal protection even if only a small portion of the population comply with social distance. Finally, the face mask effectiveness in curbing the viral spread is not reduced if a large fraction of population is asymptomatic. Our findings have important implications for policies that dictate the reopening of social gatherings.

Author summaryThe COVID-19 outbreak has created an enormous burden on the worldwide population. Among the various ways of preventing the spread of the virus, face masks have been proposed as a main way of reducing transmission. Yet, the interplay between the usage of face mask and other forms of Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention is still not completely clear. In this paper we introduce a stochastic individual-based model which aims at producing realistic scenarios of disease spread when mask wearing with different inward and outward efficacy and social distancing are enforced. The model elucidates the conditions that makes the two forms of intervention synergistic in preventing the spread of the disease.","Catching, A.; Capponi, S.; Yeh, M.

5170,A simulation of a COVID-19 epidemic based on a deterministic SEIR model,"An epidemic disease caused by a new coronavirus has spread in Northern Italy with a strong contagion rate. We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 24, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and uncertainty of the different parameters, namely, the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time, the number of initially exposed individuals and infected people, the incubation and infectious periods and the fatality rate.

First, we perform an analysis of the results of the model, by varying the parameters and initial conditions (in order the epidemic to start, there should be at least one exposed or one infectious human). Then, we consider the Lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (April 28, 2020) and constraint the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (March 31) approximately, when there is a rapid decrease, with a reproduction ratio R0 = 3 initially, 1.36 at day 22 and 0.78 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is almost 15325 casualties, with 2.64 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit of the dead individuals is 4.25 days and the infectious period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57 %, and 2.36 % if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initially exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47 %. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infectious periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 versus 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 % versus 0.57 %), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Other choices of the set of parameters also provide a good fit of the data, but some of the results may not be realistic. Therefore, an accurate determination of the fatality rate and characteristics of the epidemic is subject to the knowledge of precise bounds of the parameters.

Besides the specific example, the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation measures, social distancing and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic. Hence, the importance to quantify the process to verify the effectiveness of the lockdown.","Carcione, J.

DesignThis was a descriptive cross-sectional survey which employed an interviewer-administered four-page questionnaire built into the Open Data Kit application for android phones. Knowledge and practice scores were computed by scoring every correct response/action as 1 and wrong responses as 0. Knowledge was graded as excellent for scores of [&ge;]80%, good for scores of 50-79% and poor for scores of <50%. Respondents who washed all critical parts of the hand were categorized as having correct handwashing practice.

SettingRivers State in the South-South region of Nigeria had recorded over 2000 cases of COVID 19 as of 18th August 2020, ranking 5th among the high burden states in Nigeria. As with any epidemic of an infectious nature, panic, fear, and misconceptions are rife. Risk communication utilizes multi-faceted activities geared towards facilitating correct and consistent knowledge and prevention practice.

ParticipantsStudy involved 1,294 adult community residents in the 23 districts of the state.

ResultsThe respondents were aged between 18 and 80 years with average age of 39.6 years (SD = 11.9 years). A total of 710 (54.9%) were male, 476 (36.8%) were unemployed with 685 (52.9%) having secondary education. Almost all respondents 1,271 (98.2%) had heard about COVID 19. The three most common sources of information about COVID 19 were radio jingles 1102 (86.7%), television adverts 940 (74.0%) and announcements in Church 612 (48.2%). Overall, 608 (47.0%) of the respondents had poor knowledge of COVID 19. About 1167 (90.2%) of the respondents who were aware of COVID 19 acknowledged that COVID 19 is a problem in the state while 443 (34.9%) respondents believed they were unlikely contract the virus. Only 505 (39.0%) of the respondents washed all critical parts of the hand correctly.

26759,Contact tracing indicators for COVID-19: rapid scoping review and conceptual framework,"BackgroundContact tracing is one of the key interventions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic but its implementation varies widely across countries. There is little guidance on how to monitor contact tracing performance, and no systematic overview of indicators to assess contact tracing systems or conceptual framework for such indicators exists to date.

MethodsWe conducted a rapid scoping review using a systematic literature search strategy in the peer-reviewed and grey literature as well as open source online documents. We developed a conceptual framework to map indicators by type (input, process, output, outcome, impact) and thematic area (human resources, financial resources, case investigation, contact identification, contact testing, contact follow up, case isolation, contact quarantine, transmission chain interruption, incidence reduction).

ResultsWe identified a total of 153 contact tracing indicators from 1,555 peer-reviewed studies, 894 studies from grey literature sources, and 15 sources from internet searches. Two-thirds of indicators were process indicators (102; 67%), while 48 (31%) indicators were output indicators. Only three (2%) indicators were input indicators. Indicators covered seven out of ten conceptualized thematic areas, with more than half being related to either case investigation (37; 24%) or contact identification (44; 29%). There were no indicators for the input area """"financial resources"""", the outcome area """"transmission chain interruption"""", and the impact area """"incidence reduction"""".

ConclusionsAlmost all identified indicators were either process or output indicators focusing on case investigation, contact identification, case isolation or contact quarantine. We identified important gaps in input, outcome and impact indicators, which constrains evidence-based assessment of contact tracing systems.

Many articles are available to support the good and bad side of this steroid use but remain inconclusive. To find some evidence about the safety of the drug, we investigated the effect of corticosteroids on the mortality of patients with respiratory viral infections including SARS-CoV-2, SARS, MERS, and Influenza.

MethodWe searched articles in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Medline, Google Scholar, and Web of Science records using keywords """"corticosteroid"""" or """"viral infection"""" or """"patients"""" or """"control study"""". Mortality was the primary outcome.

ResultOur selected 24 studies involving 16633 patients were pooled in our meta-analysis. Corticosteroid use and overall mortality were not significantly associated (P=0.176), but in subgroup analysis, corticosteroid use was significantly associated with lower mortality in the case of SARS (P=0.003) but was not significantly associated with mortality for Influenza (H1N1) (P=0.260) and SARS-CoV-2 (P=0.554). Further analysis using study types of SARS-CoV-2, we found that corticosteroid use was not significantly associated with mortality in the case of retrospective cohort studies (P=0.256) but was significantly associated with lower mortality in the case of randomized control trials (P=0.005). Our findings uncover how the outcome of particular drug treatment for different diseases with comparable pathogenesis may not be similar and, RCTs are sometimes required for robust outcome data.

ConclusionAt the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, data of corticosteroid use from other viral infections along with COVID-19 observational and retrospective cohort studies created confusion of its effect, but randomized control trials showed that corticosteroid can be used to treat COVID-19 patients.","Ali, S.; Uddin, S.

To address within-country variations, the analysis was extended to the state level with Sarawak state as an example.

Methodology/Principal FindingsDatasets on the daily confirmed cases and climate variables in Malaysia and Sarawak state were obtained from publicly accessible official websites. A descriptive analysis was performed to characterize all the important variables over the study period. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was introduced using daily cases as the dependent variable and climate parameters as the explanatory variables.

For Malaysia, the findings suggest that, ceteris paribus, the number of COVID-19 cases decreased with increasing average temperature (p=0.003) or wind speed (p=0.029). However, none of the climate parameters showed a significant relationship with the number of COVID-19 cases in Sarawak state. Forecasts from the ARIMA models showed that new daily COVID-19 cases had already reached the outbreak level and a decreasing trend in both settings. Holding other parameters constant, a small number of new cases (approximately a single digit) is a probable second wave in Sarawak state,

Conclusions/SignificanceThe findings suggest that climate parameters and forecasts are helpful for reducing the uncertainty in the severity of future COVID-19 transmission. A highlight is that forecasts will be a useful tool for making decisions and taking the appropriate interventions to contain the spread of the virus in the community.","Naing, C.; Ni, H.; Aung, H.

12165,Local measures enable COVID-19 containment with fewer restrictions due to cooperative effects,"Many countries worldwide that were successful in containing the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic are faced with the seemingly impossible choice between the resurgence of infections and endangering the economic and mental well-being of their citizens. While blanket measures are slowly being lifted and infection numbers are monitored, a systematic strategy for balancing contact restrictions and the freedom necessary for a functioning society long-term in the absence of a vaccine is currently lacking. Here, we propose a regional strategy with locally triggered containment measures that can largely circumvent this trade-off and substantially lower the magnitude of restrictions the average individual will have to endure in the near future. For the simulation of future disease dynamics and its control, we use current data on the spread of COVID-19 in Germany, Italy, England, New York State and Florida, taking into account the regional structure of each country and their past lockdown efficiency. Overall, our analysis shows that tight regional control in the short term can lead to long-term net benefits due to small-number effects which are amplified by the regional subdivision and crucially depend on the rate of cross-regional contacts. We outline the mechanisms and parameters responsible for these benefits and suggest possible was to gain access to them, simultaneously achieving more freedom for the population and successfully containing the epidemic. Our open-source simulation code is freely available and can be readily adapted to other countries. We hope that our analysis will help create sustainable, theory-driven long-term strategies for the management of the COVID-19 epidemic until therapy or immunization options are available.","Bittihn, P.; Hupe, L.; Isensee, J.; Golestanian, R.",2020-07-24,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.07.24.20161364,1,Ramin Golestanian,Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.20161364v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.20161364v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100718
5950,"Full-spectrum dynamics of the coronavirus disease outbreak in Wuhan, China: a modeling study of 32,583 laboratory-confirmed cases","Vigorous non-pharmaceutical interventions have largely suppressed the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the transmission dynamics and evaluate the impact of interventions using 32,583 laboratory-confirmed cases from December 8, 2019 till March 8, 2020, accounting for time-varying ascertainment rates, transmission rates, and population movements. The effective reproductive number R0 dropped from 3.89 (95% credible interval: 3.79-4.00) before intervention to 0.14 (0.11-0.28) after full-scale multi-8 pronged interventions. By projection, the interventions reduced the total infections in Wuhan by 96.5% till March 8. Furthermore, we estimated that 79% (lower bound: 60%) of the total infections were unascertained, potentially including asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic cases. The probability of resurgence was 0.22 and 0.10 based on models with 79% and 60% infections unascertained, respectively, assuming interventions were lifted after a 14-day period of no new ascertained infections. These results provide important implications for continuing surveillance and interventions to eventually contain the outbreak.","Hao, X.; Cheng, S.; Wu, D.; Wu, T.; Lin, X.; Wang, C.",2020-05-26,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.27.20078436,2,Chaolong Wang,Huazhong University of Science and Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.27.20078436v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.27.20078436v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
12410,New Insights on Excess Deaths and COVID-19,"BackgroundWeinberger and colleagues estimated that 27,065 of the 122,300 excess deaths in the United States between March 1 and May 30, 2020 did not have a COVID-19 cause of death.

MethodsThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) post weekly data on mortality for 13 causes of death from the most prevalent comorbid conditions reported on death certificates where COVID-19 was listed as a cause of death. The 2015-2019 data for weeks 10 through 22 were used to forecast the number of deaths from the 13 causes in the absence of COVID-19 during 2020. The forecast was subtracted from the observed number of deaths for each cause during the period March 1 to May 30, 2020.

ResultsThe total of the differences for each of the 13 causes of death, 18,489 deaths, accounts for over two-thirds of the 27,065 excess deaths not due to COVID-19.

ConclusionCombining the 95,235 reported COVID-19 deaths with the 18,489 from the 13 most frequent comorbid conditions reported on death certificates where COVID-19 was a cause suggests that as many as 93% of the excess deaths were due to COVID-19 and implies that COVID-19 deaths were undercounted. Ongoing assessment of excess deaths and causes of death is needed to provide a better understanding of the pandemics dynamics.","Wetzler, H. P.; Cobb, H.

17732,Encephalopathies associated with severe COVID-19 present specific neurovascular unit alterations without evidence of strong neuroinflammation,"ObjectiveCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been associated with a large variety of neurological disorders. However the mechanisms underlying these neurological complications remain elusive. In this study we aimed at determining whether neurological symptoms were caused by SARS-CoV-2 direct infection or by either systemic or local pro-inflammatory mediators.

MethodsWe checked for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-qPCR, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and for 49 cytokines/chemokines/growth factors (by Luminex) in the cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) +/-sera of a cohort of 22 COVID-19 patients with neurological presentation and 55 neurological control patients (inflammatory [IND], non-inflammatory [NIND], multiple sclerosis [MS]).

ResultsWe detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA and virus-specific antibodies in the CSF of 0/22 and 10/21 COVID-19 patients, respectively. Of the four categories of tested patients, the CSF of IND exhibited the highest level of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. In contrast, COVID-19 patients did not present overall upregulation of inflammatory mediators in the CSF. However, the CSF of patients with severe COVID-19 (ICU patients) exhibited higher concentrations of CCL2, CXCL8, and VEGF-A in the CSF than patients with a milder form of COVID-19. In addition, we could show that intrathecal CXCL8 synthesis was linked to an elevated barrier index and correlated to the increase of peripheral inflammation (serum HGF and CXCL10).

ConclusionOur results point at an absence of massive SARS-CoV-2 infection or inflammation of the central nervous system, but highlight a specific impairment of the neurovascular unit linked to intrathecal production of CXCL8.","Bernard-Valnet, R.; Perriot, S.; Canales, M.; Pizzarotti, B.; Caranzano, L.; Castro-Jimenez, M.; Epiney, J.-B.; Vijiala, S.; Salvioni Chiabotti, P.; Anichini, A.; Salerno, A.; Jaton, K.; Vaucher, J.; Perreau, M.; Greub, G.; Pantaleo, G.; Du Pasquier, R.",2021-02-21,Neurology,10.1101/2020.11.01.20217497,2,Raphael Bernard-Valnet,Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.01.20217497v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.01.20217497v2.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
16423,Lockdown impact on age-specific contact patterns and behaviours in France,"In the first trimester 2020, a significant number of countries implemented general lockdowns of their populations to contain the quickly expanding SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and avoid major saturation of health care capacity. Understanding how these unprecedented measures impacted population behaviour and contact patterns is key to predict more accurately the health, social and economic impacts of such extreme actions if they were to be applied to future outbreaks. We set up an online survey to measure how the lockdown affected social contact patterns in France, and collected information from 42,036 participants aged 18 years and over between April 10 and April 28, 2020. Among the participants who normally worked outside home prior to the lockdown (72% of the survey population), 68% reported that they had moved to working from home and 17% reported being unemployed during the lockdown.

Only 2% of participants used public transport during lockdown, as opposed to 37% before it. Participants reported increased frequency of washing hands, switch in greeting behaviour, but generally limited use of masks outside home. 138,934 contacts were reported, with an average 3.3 contacts per individual per day (1.7 for individuals aged >65 years old compared to 3.6 for younger age-groups). This represented a 70% reduction compared with previous surveys, consistent with reductions in transmission rates measured during the lockdown. Contacts in workplaces, shops, and transports on the previous day were respectively reported in only 11%, 31% and 0.5% of the participants. For those who maintained a professional activity outside home, the frequency of contacts at work dropped by 79%. This study shows that the lockdown dramatically affected populations behavior, work, risk perception and contact patterns. Both frequency and heterogeneity of contacts were affected, impacting potential important features of virus dissemination. Such surveys are essential to evaluate more accurately the impact of past or future lockdowns and anticipate epidemic dynamics in these conditions.","Bosetti, P.; Huynh, B.-T.; Youssouf Abdou, A.; Sanchez, M.; Eisenhauer, C.; Courtejoie, N.; Accardo, J.; Salje, H.; Guillemot, D.; Moslonka-Lefebvre, M.; Boëlle, P.-Y.; Beraud, G.; Cauchemez, S.; Opatowski, L.",2020-10-11,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.07.20205104,1,Paolo Bosetti,Institut Pasteur,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.07.20205104v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.07.20205104v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
7392,Rapid estimation of excess mortality in times of COVID-19 in Portugal - Beyond reported deaths,"BackgroundOne month after the first COVID-19 infection was recorded, Portugal counted 18 051 cases and 599 deaths from COVID-19. To understand the overall impact on mortality of the pandemic of COVID-19, we estimated the excess mortality registered in Portugal during the first month of the epidemic, from March 16 until April 14 using two different methods.

MethodsWe compared the observed and expected daily deaths (historical average number from daily death registrations in the past 10 years) and used 2 standard deviations confidence limit for all-cause mortality by age and specific mortality cause, considering the last 6 years. An adapted ARIMA model was also tested to validate the estimated number of all-cause deaths during the study period.

ResultsBetween March 16 and April 14, there was an excess of 1,255 all-cause deaths, 14% more than expected. The number of daily deaths often surpassed the 2 standard deviations confidence limit. The excess mortality occurred mostly in people aged 75+. Forty-nine percent (49%) of the estimated excess deaths were registered as due to COVID-19, The other 51% registered as other natural causes.

ConclusionEven though Portugal took early containment measures against COVID-19, and the population complied massively with those measures, there was significant excess mortality during the first month of the pandemic, mostly among people aged 75+. Only half of the excess mortality was registered as directly due do COVID-19.","Vieira, A.; Peixoto, V.

25130,COVID-19 outcomes among hospitalized men with or without exposure to alpha-1-adrenergic receptor blocking agents,"ImportanceAlpha-1-adrenergic receptor antagonists (1-blockers) can abrogate pro-inflammatory cytokines and may improve outcomes among patients with respiratory infections. Repurposing readily available drugs such as 1-blockers could augment the medical response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the association between 1-blocker exposure and COVID-19 mortality

DesignReal-world evidence study

SettingPatient level data with 32,355 records tested for SARS-CoV-2 at the Mount Sinai Health System including 8,442 laboratory-confirmed cases extracted from five member hospitals in the New York City metropolitan area.

Participants2,627 men aged 45 or older admitted with COVID-19 between February 24 and May 31, 2020

Exposures1-blocker use as an outpatient or while admitted for COVID-19

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIn-hospital mortality

ResultsMen exposed to 1-blockers (N=436) were older (median age 73 vs. 64 years, P<0.001) and more likely to have comorbidities than unexposed men (N=2,191). Overall, 758 (28.9%) patients died in hospital, 1,589 (60.5%) were discharged, and 280 (10.7%) were still hospitalized as of May 31, 2020. Outpatient exposure to 1-blockers was not associated with COVID-19 hospital outcomes, though there was a trend towards significance (OR 0.749, 95% CI 0.527-1.064; P=0.106). Conversely, inpatient use of 1-blockers was independently associated with improved in-hospital mortality in both multivariable logistic (OR 0.633, 95% CI 0.434-0.921; P=0.017) and Cox regression analyses (HR 0.721, 95% CI 0.572-0.908; P=0.006) adjusting for patient demographics, comorbidities, and baseline vitals and labs. Age-stratified analyses suggested greater benefit from inpatient 1-blocker use among younger age groups: Age 45-65 OR 0.384, 95% CI 0.164-0.896 (P=0.027); Age 55-75 OR 0.511, 95% CI 0.297-0.880 (P=0.015); Age 65-89 OR 0.810, 95% CI 0.509-1.289 (P=0.374).

20272,Effective design of barrier enclosure to contain aerosol emissions from COVID-19 patients,"Facing shortages of personal protective equipment, some clinicians have advocated the use of barrier enclosures (typically mounted over the head, with and without suction) to contain aerosol emissions from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. There is however little evidence for its usefulness. To test the effectiveness of such a device, we built a manikin that can expire micron-sized aerosols at flow rates close to physiological conditions. We then placed the manikin inside the enclosure and used a laser sheet to visualize the aerosol leaking out. We show that with sufficient suction, it is possible to effectively contain aerosol from the manikin even at high flow rates (up to 60 L min-1) of oxygen, reducing aerosol exposure outside the enclosure by 99%. In contrast, a passive barrier without suction only reduces aerosol exposure by 60%.","Daniel, D.; Lin, M.; Luhung, I.; Lui, T.; Sadovoy, A.; Koh, X.; Sng, A.; Tran, T.; Schuster, S.; Loh, X.

26606,Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen diagnostic tests for saliva samples,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for rapid, cost effective and easy-to-use diagnostic tools for SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen detection (RAD) for use in point of care settings or as self-tests, to limit disease transmission. Using saliva samples would further greatly facilitate sample collection, diagnostic feasibility, and mass screening.

ObjectiveWe tested two rapid antigen immunochromatographic tests designed for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva: Rapid Response COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test Cassette for oral fluids (Rapid Response) and DIAGNOS COVID-19 Antigen Saliva Test (DIAGNOS). Evaluation of detection limit was performed with purified SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and titrated live SARS-CoV-2 virus and compared to Abbott Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Panbio) designed for nasopharyngeal samples. Sensitivity and specificity were further evaluated on RT-qPCR positive and negative saliva samples from individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 (n=34); and asymptomatic health care personnel (n=20).

ResultsThe limit of detection of the saliva test from DIAGNOS was comparable with the Panbio test and showed higher sensitivity than Rapid Response for both nucleocapsid protein and diluted live viruses. DIAGNOS and Rapid Response further detected seven (47%) and five (33%), respectively, of the 15 RT-qPCR positive saliva samples in individuals hospitalized with COVID-19. Of the 39 RT-qPCR negative samples, all were negative with both tests (specificity 100%; 95% c.i. 0.91-1.00). Only one of the RT-qPCR positive saliva samples (Ct 21.6) contained infectious virus as determined by cell culture and was also positive using the saliva RADs.

ConclusionThe results show that the DIAGNOS test exhibit a similar limit of detection as the Panbio RAD and may be an important and easy-to-use saliva RAD complement to detect infectious individuals.","Hagbom, M.; Carmona-Vicente, N.; Sharma, S.; Olsson, H.; Jamtberg, M.; Nilsdotter-Augustinsson, A.; Sjowall, J.; Nordgren, J.",2021-05-16,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.05.14.21257100,1,Johan Nordgren,Linkoping University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.14.21257100v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.14.21257100v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
15264,Demand for Self-Managed Online Telemedicine Abortion in Eight European Countries During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Regression Discontinuity Analysis,"ObjectivesIn most European countries, patients seeking medication abortion during the COVID-19 pandemic are still expected to attend healthcare settings in person despite lockdown measures and infection risk. We assessed whether demand for self-managed medication abortion provided by a fully remote online telemedicine service increased following the emergence of COVID-19.

DesignWe used regression discontinuity to compare the number of requests to online telemedicine service Women on Web in eight European countries before and after they implemented lockdown measures to slow COVID-19 transmission. We examined the number deaths due to COVID-19, the degree of government-provided economic support, the severity of lockdown travel restrictions, and the medication abortion service provision model in countries with and without significant changes in requests.

SettingEight European countries served by Women on Web.

Participants3,915 people who made requests for self-managed abortion to Women on Web between January 1st, 2019 and June 1st, 2020.

Main Outcome MeasuresPercent change in requests to Women on Web before and after the emergence of COVID-19 and associated lockdown measures.

ResultsFive countries showed significant increases in requests, ranging from 28% in Northern Ireland (p=0.001) to 139% in Portugal (p<0.001). Two countries showed no significant change in requests, and one country, Great Britain, showed an 88% decrease in requests (p<0.001). Countries with significant increases in requests were either countries where abortion services are mainly provided in hospitals or where no abortion services are available and international travel was prohibited during lockdown. By contrast, Great Britain authorized teleconsultation for medication abortion and provision of medications by mail during the pandemic.

ConclusionThese marked changes in requests for self-managed medication abortion during COVID-19 demonstrate demand for fully remote models of abortion care and an urgent need for policymakers to expand access to medication abortion by telemedicine.

15308,Social distancing: barriers to its implementation and how they can be overcome - a rapid systematic review,"AimTo systematically review qualitative literature on social distancing in order to identify and describe factors that enable or prevent its implementation.

MethodsA rapid systematic qualitative review was conducted for which a comprehensive systematic search was carried out across eleven databases. Included papers report on primary qualitative studies of the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of social distancing measures in potentially epidemic infectious diseases. An adapted meta-ethnographical approach was used for synthesis. Review findings were assessed for strength and reliability using GRADE-CERQual.

Results29 papers were included from the systematic search that yielded 5620 results and supplementary methods. The review identifies two broad categories of barriers to social distancing measures: individual- or community-level psychological or sociological phenomena, and perceived shortcomings in governmental action. Based on this, 25 themes are identified that can be addressed to improve the implementation of social distancing.

ConclusionThere are many barriers, on different levels, to the implementation of social distancing measures. Among other findings, the review identifies the need for good communication as well as the need for authorities to provide comprehensive support as two key opportunities to increase acceptability and adherence. High-quality research is needed during the COVID-19 pandemic to better describe mechanisms by which implementation of social distancing can be improved, and, more importantly, what is already known has to be put into practice.","Sadjadi, M.; Moerschel, K.

15489,Quantifying the Effects of Social Distancing on the Spread of COVID-19,"This paper studies the interplay between the social distancing and the spread of COVID-19 disease--a widely spread pandemic that has affected nearly most of the world population. Starting in China, the virus has reached the United States of America with devastating consequences. Other countries severely affected by the pandemic are Brazil, Russia, United Kingdom, Spain, India, Italy, and France. Even though it is not possible to eliminate the spread of the virus from the world or any other country, it might be possible to reduce its effect by decreasing the number of infected people. Implementing such policies needs a good understanding of the systems dynamics, generally not possible with mathematical linear equations or Monte Carlo methods because human society is a complex adaptive system with complex and continuous feedback loops. As a result, we use agent-based methods to conduct our study. Moreover, recent agent-based modeling studies for the COVID-19 pandemic show significant promise assisting decision-makers in managing the crisis through applying some policies such as social distancing, disease testing, contact tracing, home isolation, providing good emergency and hospitalization strategies, and preventing traveling would lead to reducing the infection rates. Based on imperial college modeling studies that prove increasing levels of interventions could slow down the spread of disease and infection cases as much as possible, and taking into account that social distancing policy is considered to be the most important factor that was recommended to follow. Our proposed model is designed to test if increasing the social distancing policies strictness can slow down the spread of disease significantly or not, and find out what is the required safe level of social distancing. So, the model was run six times, with six different percentages of social distancing with keeping the other parameters levels fixed for all experiments. The results of our study show that social distancing affects the spread of COVID-19 significantly, where the spread of disease and infection rates decrease once social distancing procedures are implemented at higher levels. Also, the behavior space tool was used to run ten experiments with different levels of social distancing, which supported the previous results. We concluded that applying and increasing social distancing policy levels led to significantly reduced infection rates, which result in decreasing deaths. Both types of experiments prove that infection rates are reduced dramatically when the level of social distancing intervention is implemented between 80% to 100%.","Daghriri, T.; Ozmen, O.",2020-10-15,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.19.20197996,3,Talal Daghriri,University of Central Florida,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.19.20197996v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.19.20197996v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.3390/ijerph18115566
8163,Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and mortality in patients with hypertension hospitalized for COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"ObjectiveThe association between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) inhibitors and Coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) mortality is unclear. We aimed to explore the association of RAAS inhibitors, including angiotensin-converting inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) with COVID-19 mortality in patients with hypertension.

MethodsMEDLINE, SCOPUS, OVID, and Cochrane Library were searched for the period of January 1, 2020 to May 20, 2020. Studies reporting the association of RAAS inhibitors (ACEi and ARBs) and mortality in patients with hypertension, hospitalized for COVID-19 were extracted. Two reviewers independently extracted appropriate data of interest and assessed the risk of bias. All analyses were performed using random-effects models on log-transformed risk ratio estimates, and heterogeneity was quantified.

ResultsData were collected on 2,065,805 individuals (mean age, 58.73 years; 53.4% male). Patients with hypertension taking RAAS inhibitors were 35% less likely to die from COVID-19 compared to patients with hypertension not taking RAAS inhibitors (pooled RR= 0.65, 95% Confidence Intervals (CI): 0.45-0.94). To explore the association of COVID-19 and specific classes of RAAS inhibitors, we conducted a subgroup analysis of ARBs and ACEi separately from studies that provided them. Pooled risk ratio estimates from ARBs and ACEi showed a lower but not significant risk of death from COVID-19 (RR=0.93, 95% CI: 0.70-1.22) and ACEi (RR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.32-1.30).

ConclusionsIn this meta-analysis, it was discovered that taking RAAS inhibitors, significantly decreased the risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients with hypertension. This indicates a potential protective role that RAAS-inhibitors may have in COVID-19 patients with hypertension.

Key QuestionsO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about this subject?C_ST_ABSSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, interfaces with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Recent studies have questioned whether RAAS inhibitors are safe in patients with COVID-19. However, observational studies involving patients hospitalized with COVID-19 that report the association of RAAS-inhibitors and COVID-19 severity or death have yielded conflicting findings.

What does this study add?This systematic review and meta-analysis discovered that RAAS inhibitors reduced the risk of mortality by 35% in patients with hypertension hospitalized for COVID-19 (RR= 0.65, 95% CI 0.45-0.94).

How might this impact clinical practice?Patients taking RAAS-inhibitors to manage their hypertension should continue to do as per current treatment guidelines.","Ssentongo, A.; Ssentongo, P.; Heilbrunn, E.

13939,Correlation of National and Healthcare Workers COVID-19 Infection Data; Implications for Large-scale Viral Testing Programs,"Time analysis of the course of an infectious disease epidemic is a critical way to understand the dynamics of pathogen transmission and the effect of population scale interventions. Computational methods have been applied to the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak in five different countries (Ireland, Germany, UK, South Korea and Iceland) using their reported daily infection data. A Gaussian convolution smoothing function constructed a continuous epidemic line profile that was segmented into longitudinal time series of mathematically fitted individual logistic curves. The time series of fitted curves allowed comparison of disease progression with differences in decreasing daily infection numbers following the epidemic peak being of specific interest. A positive relationship between rate of declining infections and countries with comprehensive COVID-19 testing regimes existed. In contrast, extended epidemic timeframes were recorded for those least prepared for large scale testing and contact tracing. As many countries continue to struggle to implement population wide testing it is prudent to explore additional measures that could be employed. Comparative analysis of healthcare worker (HCW) infection data from Ireland shows it closely related to that of the entire population with respect to trends of daily infection numbers and growth rates over a 57-day period. With 31.6% of all test-confirmed infections in healthcare workers (all employees of healthcare facilities), they represent a concentrated 3% subset of the national population which if exhaustively tested (regardless of symptom status) could provide valuable information on disease progression in the entire population (or set). Mathematically, national population and HCWs can be viewed as a set and subset with significant influences on each other, with solidarity between both an essential ingredient for ending this crisis.","Wu, D.; Mac Aonghusa, P.; O'shea, D.",2020-08-24,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.08.21.20179283,1,Donal O'shea,Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179283v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179283v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1371/journal.pone.0250699
23182,"Clinical subphenotypes in COVID-19: derivation, validation, prediction, temporal patterns, and interaction with social determinants of health","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is heterogeneous and our understanding of the biological mechanisms of host response to the novel viral infection remains limited. Identification of meaningful clinical subphenotypes may benefit pathophysiological study, clinical practice, and clinical trials. Here, our aim was to derive and validate COVID-19 subphenotypes using machine learning and routinely collected clinical data, assess temporal patterns of these subphenotypes during the pandemic course, and examine their interaction with social determinants of health (SDoH). We retrospectively analyzed 14418 COVID-19 patients in five major medical centers in New York City (NYC), between March 1 and June 12, 2020. Using clustering analysis, four biologically distinct subphenotypes were derived in the development cohort (N = 8199). Importantly, the identified subphenotypes were highly predictive of clinical outcomes (especially 60-day mortality). Sensitivity analyses in the development cohort, and re-derivation and prediction in the internal (N = 3519) and external (N = 3519) validation cohorts confirmed the reproducibility and usability of the subphenotypes. Further analyses showed varying subphenotype prevalence across the peak of the outbreak in NYC. We also found that SDoH specifically influenced mortality outcome in Subphenotype IV, which is associated with older age, worse clinical manifestation, and high comorbidity burden. Our findings may lead to a better understanding of how COVID-19 causes disease in different populations and potentially benefit clinical trial development. The temporal patterns and SDoH implications of the subphenotypes may add new insights to health policy to reduce social disparity in the pandemic.","Su, C.; Zhang, Y.; Flory, J. H.; Weiner, M.

20149,Optimizing ventilation cycles to control airborne transmission risk of SARS-CoV2 in school classrooms,"Open schools in winter in highly epidemic areas pose a controversial issue: ventilation of classrooms (an essential mitigation factor for airborne transmission) is expected to sensibly decrease due to outdoor temperatures getting colder and regulators going to allow less restrictive policies on windows closure. Fundamental questions to be addressed are therefore: to which extent can we contain airborne transmission risk in schools? what would be the optimal ventilation strategy during the cold season considering the fact that most schools are not provided with mechanical ventilation systems? To try answering these questions a risk model for airborne transmission of covid-19 in classrooms has been develped based on previous models for tubercolosis and influenza. The separate cases of infective student and infective teacher, as well as infective teacher with microphone are investigated. We explored 3500 different air ventilation cycles for different lesson+break times and carried out a numerical optimization of the risk function. Safety risk-zones for breaks and lessons durations were estimated combining the effect of surgical masks and optimal windows opening cycles.","Zivelonghi, A.; Lai, M.",2021-03-12,Occupational And Environmental Health,10.1101/2020.12.19.20248493,4,Alessandro Zivelonghi,"ITCS \""""Lorgna-Pindemonte\"""", Verona, Italy",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.19.20248493v4?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.19.20248493v4.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,"NA"
8730,"Increased expression of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, in alveolar and bronchial epithelium of smokers and COPD subjects","RationaleSmokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk for severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

ObjectivesWe investigated the expression of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry receptor ACE2 and the protease TMPRSS2 in lung tissue from never smokers and smokers with and without COPD.

MethodsIn a cross-sectional, observational study we measured mRNA expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 by RT-PCR in lung tissue samples from 120 well phenotyped subjects. Next, protein levels of ACE2 were visualized by immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections from 87 subjects and quantified in alveolar and bronchial epithelium. Finally, primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were cultured at air liquid interface and exposed to air or cigarette smoke.

ResultsACE2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in lung tissue from current smokers and subjects with moderate to very severe COPD and correlated with physiological parameters of airway obstruction and emphysema. Pulmonary expression levels of TMPRSS2 were significantly higher in patients with (very) severe COPD and correlated significantly with ACE2 expression. Importantly, protein levels of ACE2 were elevated in both alveolar and bronchial epithelium of current smokers and subjects with moderate to very severe COPD. Finally, TMPRSS2 mRNA expression increased in in vitro cultured HBECs upon acute exposure to cigarette smoke.

ConclusionsWe demonstrate increased expression of ACE2 in lungs of smokers and COPD subjects, which might facilitate host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. These findings help identifying populations at risk for severe COVID-19.","Jacobs, M.; Van Eeckhoutte, H. P.; Wijnant, S. R.; Janssens, W.; Joos, G. F.; Brusselle, G. G.; Bracke, K.

18269,SARS-CoV-2: Proof of recombination between strains and emergence of possibly more virulent ones,"COVID-19 is challenging healthcare preparedness, world economies, and livelihoods. The infection and death rates associated with this pandemic are strikingly variable in different countries. To elucidate this discrepancy, we analyzed 2431 early spread SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GISAID. We estimated continental-wise admixture proportions, assessed haplotype block estimation, and tested for the presence or absence of strains recombination. Herein, we identified 1010 unique missense mutations and seven different SARS-CoV-2 clusters. In samples from Asia, a small haplotype block was identified; whereas, samples from Europe and North America harbored large and different haplotype blocks with nonsynonymous variants. Variant frequency and linkage disequilibrium varied among continents, especially in North America. Recombination between different strains was only observed in North American and European sequences. Additionally, we structurally modeled the two most common mutations D614G and P314L which suggested that these linked mutations may enhance viral entry and stability. Overall, we propose that COVID-19 virulence may be more severe in Europe and North America due to coinfection with different SARS-CoV-2 strains leading to genomic recombination which might be challenging for current treatment regimens and vaccine development. Furthermore, our study provides a possible explanation for the more severe second wave of COVID-19 that many countries are currently experiencing presented as higher rates of infection and death.","Haddad, D.; John, S.

15518,The effect of ABO blood group and antibody class on the risk of COVID-19 infection and severity of clinical outcomes.,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 22 million cases and caused immense burdens on governments and healthcare systems worldwide. Since its emergence in December 2019, research has been focused on ways to not only treat the infected but also identify those at risk and prevent spread. There is currently no known biological biomarker that can predict the risk of being infected. A growing set of studies have emerged that show an association between ABO blood group and the risk of COVID-19 infection. In this study, we used retrospective observational data in Bahrain to investigate the association between ABO blood group and risk of infection as well as susceptibility to a more severe ICU-requiring infection. We found that individuals with blood group B were at a higher risk of infection, while those with blood group AB were at a lower risk. No association was observed between blood group and the risk of a severe ICU-requiring COVID-19 infection. We extended the analysis to study the association by antibodies present; anti-a (blood groups B and O) and anti-b (blood groups A and O). Antibodies were not found to be associated with either risk of infection or susceptibility to severe infection. The current study, along with the variation in blood group association results, indicates that blood group may not be the most ideal biomarker to predict risk of COVID-19 infection.","Almadhi, M.; Abdulrahman, A.; Alawadhi, A.; Rabaan, A.; Alqahtani, M.",2020-09-22,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.09.22.20199422,1,Manaf Alqahtani,National Task Force for Combatting the Corona Virus (COVID19),https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.22.20199422v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.22.20199422v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"

This time-varying growth rate is estimated using the Kalman filter from data on new cases. The method is very easy to apply in practice, and it performs well even when the number of infected individuals is imperfectly measured, or the infection does not follow the SIR model.

7348,Forecasting the COVID-19 Pandemic with Climate Variables for Top Five Burdening and Three South Asian Countries,"BackgroundThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is now in a horrific situation around the world. Prediction about the number of infected and death cases may help to take immediate action to prevent the epidemic as well as control the situation of a country. The ongoing debate about the climate factors may need more validation with more studies. The climate factors of the top-five affected countries and three south Asian countries have considered in this study to have a real-time forecast and robust validation about the impact of climate variables.

MethodsThe ARIMA model have included to model the univariate cumulative confirmed and death cases separately. The MLP, ELM and likelihood-based GLM count time series also considered as they consider the external variables as exogenous regressors. As the death count includes zero itself, zero-inflated count time series model has included instead of likelihood-based GLM. The better fitting of the ARIMA model will validate the under-whelm of meteorological factors was the initial hypothesis. The best model has identified through the application and comparison with the real data points.

ResultsThe results depict that there is an influence of meteorological variables like temperature and humidity mostly for all the selected countries cumulative confirm cases excluding Italy and Sri-Lanka. However, the best models for deaths count of each country also identify the impact of meteorological variables for each country.

18289,Continued Age Shift of Confirmed Positive COVID-19 Incidence Over Time to Children and Young Adults: Washington State March - August 2020,"BackgroundAs the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic passed the initial infection peak in Washington State, phased re-opening lifted stay-at-home orders and restrictions leading to increased non-essential work, social activities and gathering, especially among younger persons.

MethodsA longitudinal cohort analysis of Washington State Department of Health COVID-19 confirmed case age distribution 1) March-April 2020 (N=13,934) and 2) March-August 2020 (N=76,032) for proportional change over time using chi square tests for significance.

ResultsFrom March 1st to April 19, 2020 COVID-19 case positive age distribution shifted with a 10% decline in cases age 60 years and older and a 20% increase in age 0-19/20-39 years (chi-square = 223.10, p <.001). Number of cases over the eight-week analysis period were 0-19 years n = 515, 20-39 years n = 4078, 40-59 years n =4788, 60-79 years n = 3221, 80+ years n = 1332. After the peak (March 22, 2020), as incidence declined in older age groups, the combined percentage of cases age 0-19 and 20-39 increased from 20% to 40% of total cases. During this time testing expanded with more testing among older age groups while case positivity shifted young. Percent positive cases by age through August 2020 increased to a consistent average of 60% less than age 40 [age 0-19 increased to 19% (N = 10257), age 20-39 increased to 42% (N = 30215)].

ConclusionsAn increased share of COVID-19 incidence among children (age 0-19) and young adults (age 20-39) indicates their elevated role in propagating the epidemic by creating a reservoir of disease with risk of spillovers to more vulnerable older persons and those with comorbid conditions. Media savvy and age appropriate COVID-19 messaging may increase mitigation compliance among these less vulnerable, more mobile and lower priority vaccination age groups. As vaccines become available, mitigation will continue to be a priority to reduce overall population incidence.","Malmgren, J.; Guo, B.; Kaplan, H.",2020-11-16,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.11.12.20229468,1,Judith Malmgren,University of Washington,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.12.20229468v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.12.20229468v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1371/journal.pone.0243042

In recent months, a body of literature has highlighted the robustness of trends in online activity as proxies for the sociological impact of COVID-19. We find that topic clustering based on mask-related Twitter data offers revealing insights into societal perceptions of COVID-19 and techniques for its prevention. We observe that the volume and polarity of mask-related tweets has greatly increased. Importantly, the analysis pipeline presented may be leveraged by the health community for qualitative assessment of public response to health intervention techniques in real time.","Sanders, A.

11227,Optimally Pooled Viral Testing,"It has long been known that pooling samples may be used to minimize the total number of tests required in order to identify each infected individual in a population. Pooling is most advantageous in populations with low infection (positivity) rates, but is expected to remain better than non-pooled testing in populations with infection rates up to 30%. For populations with infection rates lower than 10%, additional testing efficiency may be realized by performing a second round of pooling to test all the samples in the positive first-round pools. The present predictions are validated by recent COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pooled testing and detection sensitivity measurements performed using non-optimal pool sizes, and quantify the additional improvement in testing efficiency that could have been obtained using optimal pooling. Although large pools are most advantageous for testing populations with very low infection rates, they are predicted to become highly non-optimal with increasing infection rate, while pool sizes smaller than 10 remain near-optimal over a broader range of infection rates.","Ben-Amotz, D.",2020-07-21,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.05.20145805,2,Dor Ben-Amotz,Purdue University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20145805v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20145805v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.epidem.2020.100413
11399,"Using simulation to assess the potential effectiveness of implementing screening at national borders during international outbreaks of influenza, SARS, Ebola virus disease and COVID-19","The effectiveness of screening travellers for signs of infection during times of international disease outbreak is contentious, especially as the reduction of the risk of disease importation can be very small. Border screening typically consists of arriving individuals being thermally scanned for signs of fever and/or completing a survey to declare any possible symptoms, and while more thorough testing typically exists, these would generally prove more disruptive to deploy. In this paper, we utilise epidemiological data and Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the potential success rate of deploying border screening for a range of diseases (including the current COVID-19 pandemic) in varying outbreak scenarios. We negate the issue of testing precision by assuming a """"perfect"""" test is used; our outputs then represent the best-case scenario. We then use these outputs to briefly explore the types of scenarios where the implementation of border screening could prove most effective. Our models only considers screening implemented at airports, due to air travel being the predominant method of international travel. Primary results showed that in the best-case scenario, screening has the potential to detect 46.4%, 12.9% and 4.0% of travellers infected with influenza, SARS and ebola respectively, while screening for COVID-19 could potentially detect 12.0% of infected travellers.

19386,"Use of Public Data to Describe COVID-19 Contact Tracing in China during January 20-February 29, 2020","ObjectiveAlthough contact tracing is generally not used to control influenza pandemics, China and several countries in the Western Pacific Region employed contact tracing as part of COVID-19 response activities. To improve understanding on the use of contact tracing for COVID-19 emergency public health response activities, we describe reported COVID-19 contacts traced and quarantined in China and a proxy for number of reported contacts traced per reported case.

MethodsWe abstracted publicly available online aggregate data reported from Chinas National Health Commission and provincial health commissions COVID-19 daily situational reports for January 20-February 29, 2020. The number of new contacts traced by report date was computed as the difference between total contacts traced on consecutive reports. A proxy for the number of contacts traced per case was computed as the number of new contacts traced divided by the number of new cases.

ResultsDuring January 20-February 29, 2020, China reported 80,968 new COVID-19 cases (Hubei Province = 67,608 [83%]), and 659,899 contacts traced (Hubei Province = 265,617 [40%]). Non-Hubei provinces reported more contacts traced per case than Hubei Province; this difference increased over time.

DiscussionAlong with other NPI used in China, contact tracing likely contributed to reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission by quarantining a large number of potentially infected contacts.

7861,Avoiding COVID-19: Aerosol Guidelines,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought into sharp focus the need to understand respiratory virus transmission mechanisms. In preparation for an anticipated influenza pandemic, a substantial body of literature has developed over the last few decades showing that the short-range aerosol route is an important, though often neglected transmission path. We develop a simple mathematical model for COVID-19 transmission via aerosols, apply it to known outbreaks, and present quantitative guidelines for ventilation and occupancy in the workplace.","Evans, M.",2020-06-05,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.21.20108894,3,Matthew Evans,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.20108894v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.20108894v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
11402,Diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection,"SARS-CoV-2 causes multiple immune-related reactions at various stages of the disease. The wide variety of skin presentations has delayed linking these to the virus. Previous studies had attempted to look at the prevalence and timing of SARS-COV-2 rashes but were based on mostly hospitalized severe cases and had little follow up. Using data collected on a subset of 336,847 eligible UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app, we observed that 8.8% of the swab positive cases (total: 2,021 subjects) reported either a body rash or an acral rash, compared to 5.4% of those with a negative swab test (total: 25,136). Together, these two skin presentations showed an odds ratio (OR) of 1.67 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.41-1.96) for being swab positive. Skin rashes were also predictive in the larger untested group of symptomatic app users (N=54,652), as 8.2% of those who had reported at least one classical COVID-19 symptom, i.e., fever, persistent cough, and/or anosmia, also reported a rash. Data from an independent online survey of 11,546 respondents with a rash showed that in 17% of swab positive cases, the rash was the initial presentation. Furthermore, in 21%, the rash was the only clinical sign. Skin rashes cluster with other COVID-19 symptoms, are predictive of a positive swab test and occur in a significant number of cases, either alone or before other classical symptoms. Recognising rashes is important in identifying new and earlier COVID-19 cases.","Visconti, A.; Bataille, V.; Rossi, N.; Kluk, J.; Murphy, R.; Puig, S.; Nambi, R.; Bowyer, R. C.

11820,Changes in SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Responses Impact the Estimates of Infections in Population-Based Seroprevalence Studies,"We have determined SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in a cohort of 96 individuals with acute infection and in 578 individuals enrolled in a seroprevalence population study in Switzerland including three groups, i.e. subjects with previous RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (n=90),  positive patient contacts (n=177) and  random selected subjects (n=311). SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses specific to the Spike (S), in the monomeric and native trimeric forms, and/or the nucleocapsid (N) proteins were equally sensitive in the acute infection phase. Interestingly, as compared to anti-S antibody responses, those against the N protein appear to wane in the post-infection and substantially underestimated the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the groups of  patient positive contacts, i.e. 10.9 to 32.2% reduction and in the  random selected general population, i.e. up to 45% reduction. The overall reduction in seroprevalence targeting only anti-N IgG antibodies for the total cohort ranged from 9.4 to 31%. Of note, the use of the S protein in its native trimer form was more sensitive as compared to monomeric S proteins.

These results indicate that the assessment of anti-S IgG antibody responses against the native trimeric S protein should be implemented to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infections in population-based seroprevalence studies.","Fenwick, C.; Croxatto, A.; Coste, A.

23700,"Genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in the United Arab Emirates reveals novel virus mutation, patterns of co-infection and tissue specific host innate immune response","To unravel the source of SARS-CoV-2 introduction and the pattern of its spreading and evolution in the United Arab Emirates, we conducted meta-transcriptome sequencing of 1,067 nasopharyngeal swab samples collected between May 9th and Jun 29th, 2020 during the first peak of the local COVID-19 epidemic. We identified global clade distribution and eleven novel genetic variants that were almost absent in the rest of the world defined five subclades specific to the UAE viral population. Cross-settlement human-to-human transmission was related to the local business activity. Perhaps surprisingly, at least 5% of the population were co-infected by SARS-CoV-2 of multiple clades within the same host. We also discovered an enrichment of cytosine-to-uracil mutation among the viral population collected from the nasopharynx, that is different from the adenosine-to-inosine change previously reported in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples and a previously unidentified upregulation of APOBEC4 expression in nasopharynx among infected patients, indicating the innate immune host response mediated by ADAR and APOBEC gene families could be tissue-specific. The genomic epidemiological and molecular biological knowledge reported here provides new insights for the SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission and points out future direction on host-pathogen interaction investigation.","Liu, R.; Wu, P.; Ogrodzki, P.; Mahmoud, S.; Liang, K.; Liu, P.; Francis, S.

14839,EARLY VIRAL CLEARANCE AMONG COVID-19 PATIENTS WHEN GARGLING WITH POVIDONE-IODINE AND ESSENTIAL OILS: A PILOT CLINICAL TRIAL,"BackgroundGargling had been reported to have significant roles in the prevention and treatment of respiratory tract infections. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of regular gargling to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 in the oropharynx and nasopharynx.

MethodologyThis pilot, open labeled, randomized, parallel study compared the effect of 30 seconds, 3 times/day gargling using 1% povidone-iodine (PVP-I), essential oils and tap water on SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance among COVID-19 patients in a tertiary hospital in Kuala Lumpur. Progress was monitored by day 4,6 and 12 PCR (Ct value), gargling and symptoms diary as well as clinical observations.

ResultsFive confirmed Stage 1 COVID-19 patients were recruited for each arm. The age range was from 22 to 56 years old. The majority were males. Two respondents had co-morbidities, which were asthma and obesity. Viral clearance was achieved at day 6 in 100%, 80%, 20% and 0% for 1% PVP-I, essential oils, tap water and control group respectively. Analysis of 1% PVP-I group versus control group showed significant p-value for comparison of PCR results on Day 4, Day 6 and Day 12.

ConclusionsThis preliminary study showed that gargling with 1% PVP-I and essential oils show great potential to be part of the treatment and management of Stage 1 COVID-19. Larger studies are required to ascertain the benefit of gargling for different stages of COVID-19 patients. This study was registered in clinicaltrial.gov (NCT04410159).","Mohamed, N.

2065,"Public Exposure to Live Animals, Behavioural Change, and Support in Containment Measures in response to COVID-19 Outbreak: a population-based cross sectional survey in China","BackgroundIn response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we aimed to investigate behavioural change on exposure to live animals before and during the outbreak, and public support and confidence for governmental containment measures.

MethodsA population-based cross-sectional telephone survey via random dialing was conducted in Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases) between 1 and 10 February, 2020. 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai were randomly sampled. Differences of outcome measures were compared before and during the outbreak, and between two cities.

FindingsProportion of respondents visiting wet markets at usual was 23.3% (119/510) in Wuhan and 20.4% (102/501) in Shanghai. During the outbreak, it decreased to 3.1% (16) in Wuhan (p<0{middle dot}001), and 4.4% (22) in Shanghai (p<0{middle dot}001). Proportion of those consuming wild animal products declined from 10.2% (52) to 0.6% (3) in Wuhan (p<0{middle dot}001), and from 5.2% (26) to 0.8% (4) in Shanghai (p<0{middle dot}001). 79.0% (403) of respondents in Wuhan and 66.9% (335) of respondents in Shanghai supported permanent closure of wet markets (P<0.001). 95% and 92% of respondents supported banning wild animal trade and quarantining Wuhan, and 75% were confident towards containment measures. Females and the more educated were more supportive for the above containment measures.

InterpretationThe public responded quickly to the outbreak, and reduced exposure to live animals, especially in Wuhan. With high public support in containment measures, better regulation of wet markets and healthy diets should be promoted.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSOn February 19, 2020, we searched PubMed for papers published after January 1, 2020, containing the following terms: """"2019 nCoV"""" or """"COVID-19"""". We identified 179 studies, most of which are research on clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. To date there is no primary research to quantify public behavioural response and support in containment measures in response to the outbreak. Only four commentaries mentioned the influence of the outbreak on mental health. One commentary introduced the habit of consuming wild animal products in China. Another commentary briefly introduced isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment as public health measures in the outbreak. The Chinese government has introduced a series of strict containment measures, and societal acceptability of these measure is important for effective and sustained response. Evidence is urgently needed to help policy makers understand public response to the outbreak and support for the containment measures, but no evidence available to date.

Added value of this studyWe conducted a population-based cross-sectional telephone survey via random digital dialing in Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases) between 1 and 10 February, 2020. To date, this is the only few analyses on behavioural response to the outbreak and societal acceptability of governmental containment measures, which has been listed as the current priority of China CDC. We provide an assessment of behavioural change on exposure to live animals during the outbreak, by comparison before and during the outbreak, and between two cities with diverse exposure intensities to COVID-19. We also provide evidence on public support in governmental containment measures, including strict regulation on wet markets to reduce animal-to-human transmission and city quarantine to reduce human transmission.

Implications of all the available evidenceWe found that wild animal consumption was more prevalent in Wuhan (10.2%) than in Shanghai (5.2%). The public responded quickly to the outbreak, and significantly reduced exposure to live animals and stopped wild animal consumption, especially in Wuhan. They were very supportive of governmental containment measures. With high public support, wet markets should be better regulated, and healthy diets, including changing the traditional habit of eating wild animal products, should be promoted. This can inform policy makers in China and other countries to implement and adjust containment strategies in response to the outbreak in the future.","Hou, Z.; Lin, L.; Lu, L.; Du, F.; Qian, M.; Liang, Y.; Zhang, J.; Yu, H.",2020-02-23,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.02.21.20026146,1,Hongjie Yu,"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026146v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026146v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
7871,Importations of COVID-19 into African countries and risk of onward spread,"BackgroundThe emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 has caused widespread transmission around the world. As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April, and May following viral introduction.

MethodsWe used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 1.5 and 1.0 respectively.

FindingsWe estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algerias estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario.

ConclusionOur study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.","Sun, H.; Dickens, B.

DesignA single centre, open label randomized controlled trial

Place and DurationPulmonology department, Pak emirates Military Hospital (PEMH) from 10 April 2020 to 31 May 2020.

MethodologyFive hundred patients of both genders having age between 18-50 years who were PCR positive and had Mild COVID-19 were selected. Patients assigned to standard dose of HCQ (400mg 12 hourly day 1 then 200mg 12 hrly for next 4 days) plus SOC were 349 while 151 patients received SOC comprising of Vit C, Vit D, and Zinc only (control group). Primary outcome was progression of disease while secondary outcome was PCR negativity on day 7 and 14. The results were analyzed on SPSS version 23. P value <0.05 was considered significant.

ResultsMedian age of intervention group (34 {+/-} 11.778 years) and control group (34 {+/-} 9.813 years). Disease progressed in 16 patients, 11 (3.15%) were in intervention group as compared to 5 (3.35%) in control group, (p value = 0.865). PCR negativity in intervention and control groups were (day 7, 182 (52.1%) vs. 54 (35.7%) (p value = 0.001), (day 14, 244 (69.9%) vs. 110 (72.8%) (p value = 0.508).

19916,"Association of working shifts, inside and outside of healthcare, with risk of severe COVID-19: An observational study","BackgroundHealth and key workers are at an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; it is not known, however, if this risk is exacerbated in those with irregular work patterns. We aimed to investigate the risk of severe COVID-19 in health and shift workers.

MethodsWe included UK Biobank participants in employment or self-employed at baseline and with linked COVID-19 data to 31st August 2020. Participants were grouped as neither a health worker nor shift worker (reference category), health worker only, shift worker only, or both and associations with severe COVID-19 investigated in logistic regressions.

FindingsOf 235,685 participants (81{middle dot}5% neither health nor shift worker, 1{middle dot}4% health worker only, 16{middle dot}9% shift worker only, and 0{middle dot}3% both), there were 580 (0{middle dot}25%) cases of severe COVID-19. The risk of severe COVID-19 was higher in health workers (adjusted odds ratio: 2.32 [95% CI: 1{middle dot}33, 4{middle dot}05]; shift workers (2{middle dot}06 [1{middle dot}72, 2{middle dot}47]); and in health workers who worked shifts (7{middle dot}56 [3{middle dot}86, 14{middle dot}79]). Being both a health worker and a shift worker had a possible greater impact on the risk severe COVID-19 in South Asian and Black and African Caribbean ethnicities compared to White individuals.

InterpretationBoth health and shift work were independently associated with over twice the risk of severe COVID-19; the risk was over seven times higher in health workers who work shifts. Vaccinations, therapeutic and preventative options should take into consideration not only health and key worker status but also shift worker status.

FundingNational Institute for Health Research, UK Research and Innovation.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe risk of developing severe COVID-19 is greater in occupational groups with higher levels of viral exposure, e.g. health and key workers. We searched PubMed and medRxiv up to December 8, 2020 for papers on shift work patterns, health work and incidence of COVID-19 using the keywords """"COVID-19"""", """"SARS-CoV-2"""", """"shift work"""" """"health worker"""". Recent evidence suggests shift workers are also at increased risk of severe COVID-19 but it is not clear if the risk is exacerbated in those who work shifts in healthcare.

Added value of this studyThis study uses data from UK Biobank, a prospective cohort of >500,000 adults aged 40-69 years with baseline assessments between March 2006 and July 2010. Participants occupation was categorised according to whether or not they were health workers and/or shift workers at baseline. Results showed that being a health worker, or working shifts, were similarly and independently associated with over twice the population level risk of severe COVID-19 independent of age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation and co-morbidities. The risk was seven times higher in health workers with shift working patterns. The impact of health and shift work tended to be higher in males and in minority ethnic groups, who are already at an increased risk of severe COVID-19. In people over the age of retirement, the risk of developing severe COVID-19 associated with baseline health worker status was no longer apparent, suggesting the risk is likely explained by exposure to the virus. However, the elevated risk associated with baseline shift worker status persisted, albeit attenuated.

Implications of all the available evidenceShift workers are at elevated risk of developing severe COVID-19. The persistence of an elevated risk in people who are now over retirement age, but had a shift worker status at baseline, suggests the risk may not be fully explained by increased exposure to the virus. Vaccination, therapeutic and prevention programmes are being prioritised for health care workers. Our data suggests that shift workers should also be prioritised for these preventive measures.","Rowlands, A.; Gillies, C.; Chudasama, Y.; Davies, M.; Islam, N.; Kloecker, D.; Lawson, C.; Pareek, M.; Razieh, C.; Zaccardi, F.; Yates, T.; Khunti, K.",2020-12-18,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.12.16.20248243,1,Alex Rowlands,University of Leicester,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.16.20248243v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.16.20248243v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1186/s12889-021-10839-0
21329,Potential contribution of climate conditions on COVID-19 pandemic transmission over West and North African countries,"The COVID-19 disease, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a very contagious disease that has killed many people around the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) data, the spread of the disease appears to be slower in Africa. Although a number of studies have been published on the relationship between meteorological parameters and COVID-19 transmission, the effects of climate conditions on COVID-19 remain largely unexplored and without consensus following the main research finding over Africa (often based on a single country or city). Here, using available epidemiological data over 275 days (i.e., from March 1 to November 30, 2020) taken from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control of the European Union database and daily data of surface air temperature and humidity from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), this paper investigates the potential contributions of climate conditions on COVID-19 transmission over 16 countries selected from three bioclimatic regions of Africa (i.e., Sahel, Maghreb and Gulf of Guinea). On average, our main findings highlight statistically significant inverse correlations between COVID-19 cases and temperature over the Maghreb and the Gulf of Guinea regions, whereas positive correlations are found in the Sahel, especially over the central part including Niger and Mali. Correlations with specific humidity and water vapor parameters display significant and positive values over the Sahelian and the Gulf of Guinean countries and negative values over the Maghreb countries. In other word, results imply that the COVID-19 pandemic transmission is influenced differently across the three bioclimatic regions: i) cold and dry environmental conditions over the Maghreb; ii) warm and humid conditions over the Sahel iii) cold and humid conditions over the Gulf of Guinea. These findings could be useful for decision-makers who plan public health and control measures in affected African countries and would have substantial implications for directing respiratory disease surveillance activities.","Diouf, I.; Sy, S.; Senghor, H.; Fall, P.; Diouf, D.; Diakhate, M.; Thiaw, W.

7062,Risk factors for clinical progression in patients with COVID-19: a retrospective study of electronic health record data in the United Kingdom,"BackgroundThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak presents a significant threat to global health. A better understanding of patient clinical profiles is essential to drive efficient and timely health service strategies. In this study, we aimed to identify risk factors for a higher susceptibility to symptomatic presentation with COVID-19 and a transition to severe disease.

MethodsWe analysed data on 2756 patients admitted to Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust between 1st January and 23rd April 2020. We compared differences in characteristics between patients designated positive for COVID-19 and patients designated negative on hospitalisation and derived a multivariable logistic regression model to identify risk factors for predicting risk of symptomatic COVID-19. For patients with COVID-19, we used univariable and multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors associated with progression to severe disease defined by: 1) admission to the hospitals AICU, 2) the need for mechanical ventilation, 3) in-hospital mortality, and 4) at least one measurement of elevated D-dimer ([&ge;]1,000 g/L) indicative of increased risk of venous thromboembolism.

ResultsThe patient population consisted of 1148 COVID-19 positive and 1608 COVID-19 negative patients. Age, sex, self-reported ethnicity, C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, respiratory rate, body temperature, and systolic blood pressure formed the most parsimonious model for predicting risk of symptomatic COVID-19 at hospital admission. Among 1148 patients with COVID-19, 116 (10.1%) were admitted to the AICU, 71 (6.2%) required mechanical ventilation, 368 (32.1%) had at least one record of D-dimer levels [&ge;]1,000 g/L, and 118 patients died. In the multivariable logistic regression, age (OR = 0.953 per 1 year, 95% CI: 0.937-0.968) C-reactive protein (OR = 1.004 per 1 mg/L, 95% CI: 1.002-1.007), and white blood cell counts (OR = 1.059 per 109/L, 95% CI: 1.010-1.111) were found to be associated with admission to the AICU. Age (OR = 0.973 per 1 year, 95% CI: 0.955-0.990), C-reactive protein (OR = 1.003 per 1 mg/L, 95% CI: 1.000-1.006) and sodium (OR = 0.915 per 1 mmol/L, 0.868-0.962) were associated with mechanical ventilation. Age (OR = 1.023 per 1 year, 95% CI: 1.004-1.043), CRP (OR = 1.004 per 1 mg/L, 95% CI: 1.002-1.006), and body temperature (OR = 0.723 per 1{degrees}C, 95% CI: 0.541-0.958) were associated with elevated D-dimer. For mortality, we observed associations with age (OR = 1.060 per 1 year, 95% CI: 1.040-1.082), female sex (OR = 0.442, 95% CI: 0.442, 95% CI: 0.245-0.777), Asian ethnic background (OR = 2.237 vs White ethnic background, 95% CI: 1.111-4.510), C-reactive protein (OR = 1.004 per 1 mg/L, 95% CI: 1.001-1.006), sodium (OR = 1.038 per 1 mmol/L, 95% CI: 1.001-1.006), and respiratory rate (OR = 1.054 per 1 breath/min, 95% CI: 1.024-1.087).

ConclusionOur analysis suggests there are several demographic, clinical and laboratory findings associated with a symptomatic presentation of COVID-19. Moreover, significant associations between patient deterioration were found with age, sex and specific blood markers, chiefly C-reactive protein, and could help early identification of patients at risk of poorer prognosis. Further work is required to clarify the extent to which our observations are relevant beyond current settings.","Fletcher, R.

10920,Association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers use and the risk of infection and clinical outcome of COVID-19: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BackgroundThe effect of using Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) on the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a topic of recent debate. Although studies have examined the potential association between them, the results remain controversial. This study aims to determine the true effect of ACEI/ARBs use on the risk of infection and clinical outcome of COVID-19.

MethodsFive electronic databases (PubMed, Web of science, Cochrane library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, medRxiv preprint server) were retrieved to find eligible studies. Meta-analysis was performed to examine the association between ACEI/ARBs use and the risk of infection and clinical outcome of COVID-19.

Results22 articles containing 157,328 patients were included. Use of ACEI/ARBs was not associated with increased risk of infection (Adjusted OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.91-1.01, I2=5.8%) or increased severity (Adjusted OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.77-1.05, I2=27.6%) of COVID-19. The use of ACEI/ARBs was associated with lower risk of death from COVID-19 (Adjusted OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.44-0.99, I2=57.9%). Similar results of reduced risk of death were also found for ACEI/ARB use in COVID-19 patients with hypertension (Adjusted OR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.17-0.77, I2=0).

ConclusionThis study provides evidence that ACEI/ARBs use for COVID-19 patients does not lead to harmful outcomes and may even provide a beneficial role and decrease mortality from COVID-19. Clinicians should not discontinue ACEI/ARBs for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 if they are already on these agents.","Qu, G.; Shu, L.; Song, E. J.; Verghese, D.; Uy, J.

26956,Combining serological assays and official statistics to describe the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic: results from the EPICOVID19-RS study in Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil),"BackgroundThe EPICOVID19-RS study conducted 10 population-based surveys in Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil), starting early in the epidemic. The sensitivity of the rapid point-of-care test used in the first eight surveys has been shown to decrease over time after some phases of the study were concluded. The 9th survey used both the rapid test and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test, which has a higher and stable sensitivity.

MethodsWe provide a theoretical justification for a correction procedure of the rapid test estimates, assess its performance in a simulated dataset and apply it to empirical data from the EPICOVID19-RS study. COVID-19 deaths from official statistics were used as an indicator of the temporal distribution of the epidemic, under the assumption that fatality is constant over time. Both the indicator and results from the 9th survey were used to calibrate the temporal decay function of the rapid tests sensitivity from a previous validation study, which was used to estimate the true sensitivity in each survey and adjust the rapid test estimates accordingly.

ResultsSimulations corroborated the procedure is valid. Corrected seroprevalence estimates were substantially larger than uncorrected estimates, which were substantially smaller than respective estimates from confirmed cases and therefore clearly underestimate the true infection prevalence.

ConclusionCorrecting biased estimates requires a combination of data and modelling assumptions. This work illustrates the practical utility of analytical procedures, but also the critical need for good quality, populationally-representative data for tracking the progress of the epidemic and substantiate both projection models and policy making.","Hartwig, F.

15560,Delayed viral clearance and exacerbated airway hyperinflammation in hypertensive COVID-19 patients,"In COVID-19, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases have emerged as major risk factors for critical disease progression. Concurrently, the impact of the main anti-hypertensive therapies, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), on COVID-19 severity is controversially discussed. By combining clinical data, single-cell sequencing data of airway samples and in vitro experiments, we assessed the cellular and pathophysiological changes in COVID-19 driven by cardiovascular disease and its treatment options. Anti-hypertensive ACEi or ARB therapy, was not associated with an altered expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells and thus presumably does not change susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, we observed a more critical progress in COVID-19 patients with hypertension associated with a distinct inflammatory predisposition of immune cells. While ACEi treatment was associated with dampened COVID-19-related hyperinflammation and intrinsic anti-viral responses, under ARB treatment enhanced epithelial-immune cell interactions were observed. Macrophages and neutrophils of COVID-19 patients with hypertension and cardiovascular comorbidities, in particular under ARB treatment, exhibited higher expression of CCL3, CCL4, and its receptor CCR1, which associated with critical COVID-19 progression. Overall, these results provide a potential explanation for the adverse COVID-19 course in patients with cardiovascular disease, i.e. an augmented immune response in critical cells for the disease course, and might suggest a beneficial effect of clinical ACEi treatment in hypertensive COVID-19 patients.","Trump, S.; Lukassen, S.; Anker, M.

23491,Anti-Spike protein assays to determine post-vaccination antibody levels: a head-to-head comparison of five quantitative assays,"BackgroundReliable quantification of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is highly relevant for identifying possible vaccine failure and estimating the time of protection. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the performance of five different Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays regarding the quantification of anti-spike (S) antibodies induced after a single dose of BNT162b2.

MethodsSera of n=69 SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals 21{+/-}1 days after vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) were tested using the following quantitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays: Roche S total antibody, DiaSorin trimeric spike IgG, DiaSorin S1/S2 IgG, Abbott II IgG, and Serion/Virion IgG. Test agreement was assessed by Passing-Bablok regression. Results were further compared to the percent inhibition calculated from a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) by correlation and ROC (receiver-operating-characteristics) analysis.

ResultsIndividual values were distributed over several orders of magnitude for all assays evaluated. Although the assays were in good overall agreement ({rho}=0.80-0.94), Passing-Bablok regression revealed systematic and proportional differences, which could not be eliminated by converting the results to BAU/mL as suggested by the manufacturers. 7 (10%) individuals had a negative sVNT results (i.e. <30% inhibition). These samples were reliably identified by most assays and yielded low binding antibody levels (ROC-AUCs 0.84-0.93).

ConclusionsAlthough all assays evaluated showed good correlation, readings from different assays were not interchangeable, even when converted to BAU/mL using the WHO international standard for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin. This highlights the need for further standardization of SARS-CoV-2 serology.","Perkmann, T.; Perkmann-Nagele, N.; Koller, T.; Mucher, P.; Radakovics, A.; Marculescu, R.; Wolzt, M.; Wagner, O.

12145,"On the effect of age on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in households, schools and the community","BackgroundThere is limited information on the effect of age on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different settings, including primary, secondary and high schools, households, and the whole community. We undertook a literature review of published studies/data on detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in contacts of COVID-19 cases, as well as serological studies, and studies of infections in the school setting to examine those issues.

ResultsOur literature review presents evidence for significantly lower susceptibility to infection for children aged under 10 years compared to adults given the same exposure, for elevated susceptibility to infection in adults aged over 60y compared to younger/middle aged adults, and for the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with sleeping close to an infected individual. Published serological studies also suggest that younger adults (particularly those aged under 35y) often have high cumulative rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community. Additionally, there is some evidence of robust spread of SARS-CoV-2 in secondary/high schools, and there appears to be more limited spread in primary schools. Some countries with relatively large class sizes in primary schools (e.g.Chile and Israel) reported sizeable outbreaks in some of those schools, though routes of transmission of infection to both students and staff are not clear from current reports.

ConclusionsOpening secondary/high schools is likely to contribute to the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and, if implemented, it should require both lower levels of community transmission and greater safeguards to reduce transmission. Compared to secondary/high schools, opening primary schools and daycare facilities may have a more limited effect on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community, particularly under smaller class sizes and in the presence of mitigation measures. Efforts to avoid crowding in the classroom and other mitigation measures should be implemented, to the extent possible, when opening primary schools. Efforts should be undertaken to diminish the mixing in younger adults to mitigate the spread of the epidemic in the whole community.","Goldstein, E.; Lipsitch, M.; Cevik, M.",2020-07-28,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.19.20157362,2,Edward Goldstein,Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.19.20157362v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.19.20157362v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.1093/infdis/jiaa691
11475,At what times during infection is SARS-CoV-2 detectable and no longer detectable using RT-PCR based tests?: A systematic review of individual participant data,"STRUCTURED SUMMARYO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSTests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral ribonucleic acid (RNA), using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are pivotal to detecting current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and duration of detectable virus indicating potential for infectivity.

MethodsWe conducted an individual participant data (IPD) systematic review of longitudinal studies of RT-PCR test results in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2. We searched PubMed, LitCOVID, medRxiv and COVID-19 Living Evidence databases. We assessed risk of bias using a QUADAS- 2 adaptation. Outcomes were the percentage of positive test results by time and the duration of detectable virus, by anatomical sampling sites.

FindingsOf 5078 studies screened, we included 32 studies with 1023 SARS-CoV-2 infected participants and 1619 test results, from -6 to 66 days post-symptom onset and hospitalisation. The highest percentage virus detection was from nasopharyngeal sampling between 0 to 4 days post-symptom onset at 89% (95% confidence interval (CI) 83 to 93) dropping to 54% (95% CI 47 to 61) after 10 to 14 days. On average, duration of detectable virus was longer with lower respiratory tract (LRT) sampling than upper respiratory tract (URT). Duration of faecal and respiratory tract virus detection varied greatly within individual participants. In some participants, virus was still detectable at 46 days post- symptom onset.

InterpretationRT-PCR misses detection of people with SARS-CoV-2 infection; early sampling minimises false negative diagnoses. Beyond ten days post-symptom onset, lower RT or faecal testing may be preferred sampling sites. The included studies are open to substantial risk of bias so the positivity rates are probably overestimated.

PANEL: RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThere are numerous reports of negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results in participants with known SARS-CoV-2 infection, and increasing awareness that the ability of RT-PCR tests to detect virus depends on the timing of sample retrieval and anatomical sampling site.

Individual studies suggest that positive test results from RT-PCR with nasopharyngeal sampling declines within a week of symptoms and that a positive test later in the disease course is more likely from sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or stool, but data are inconsistent.

Added value of this studyWe searched 5078 titles and abstracts for longitudinal studies reporting individual participant data (IPD) for RT-PCR for participants with COVID-19 linked to either time since symptom onset or time since hospitalisation. Search included SARS-CoV-2 and RT-PCR keywords and MeSH terms. Each included study was subject to careful assessment of risk of bias. This IPD systematic review (SR) addresses RT-PCR test detection rates at different times since symptom onset and hospitalisation for different sampling sites, and summarises the duration of detectable virus. To our knowledge, this is the first rapid SR addressing this topic. We identified 32 studies available as published articles or pre-prints between January 1st and April 24th 2020, including participants sampled at 11 different sampling sites and some participants sampled at more than one site. At earlier time points, nasopharyngeal sampling had the highest virus detection, but the duration of shedding was shorter compared to lower respiratory tract sampling. At 10 to 14 days post-symptom onset, the percentage of positive nasopharyngeal test results was 54% compared to 89% at day 0 to 4. Presence and duration of faecal detection varied by participant, and in nearly half duration was shorter than respiratory sample detection. Virus detection varies for participants and can continue to be detected up to 46 days post-symptom onset or hospitalisation. The included studies were open to substantial risk of bias, so the detection rates are probably overestimates. There was also poor reporting of sampling methods and sparse data on sampling methods that are becoming more widely implemented, such as self-sampling and short nasal swab sampling (anterior nares/mid turbinate).

Implications of all the available evidenceResults from this IPD SR of SARS-CoV-2 testing at different time points and using different anatomical sample sites are important to inform strategies of testing. For prevention of ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, samples for RT-PCR testing need to be taken as soon as possible post-symptom onset, as we confirm that RT-PCR misses more people with infection if sampling is delayed. The percentage of positive RT-PCR tests is also highly dependent on the anatomical site sampled in infected people. Sampling at more than one anatomical site may be advisable as there is variation between individuals in the sites that are infected, as well as the timing of SARS-CoV-2 virus detection at an anatomical site. Testing ten days after symptom onset will lead to a higher frequency of negative tests, particularly if using only upper respiratory tract sampling. However, our estimates may considerably understate the frequency of negative RT-PCR results in people with SARS-CoV- 2 infection. Further investment in this IPD approach is recommended as the amount data available was small given the scale of the pandemic and the importance of the question. More studies, learning from our observations about risk of bias and strengths of example studies (Box 1, Box 2) are urgently needed to inform the optimal sampling strategy by including self-collected samples such as saliva and short nasal swabs. Better reporting of anatomical sampling sites with a detailed methodology on sample collection is also urgently needed.","Mallett, S.; Allen, J.; Graziadio, S.; Taylor, S. A.; Sakai, N.

MethodsThe EHS is an ongoing and deeply-phenotyped prospective cohort study that has recruited 667 participants in northwest Greece until August 31st, 2020. Level of knowledge on coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and COVID-19 severity was labeled as poor, moderate or good. Variables assessing knowledge and beliefs towards the pandemic were summarized overall and by gender, age group (25-39, 40-49, 50-59, [&ge;]60 years) and period of report (before the lifting of lockdown measures in Greece: March 30th to May 3rd, and two post-lockdown time periods: May 4th to June 31st, July 1st to August 31st). An exposure-wide association analysis was conducted to evaluate the associations between 153 explanatory variables and participants knowledge. Correction for multiple comparisons was applied using a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 5%.

ResultsA total of 563 participants (49 years mean age; 60% women) had available information on the standard EHS questionnaire, the clinical and biochemical measurements, and the COVID-19-related questionnaire. Percentages of poor, moderate and good knowledge status regarding COVID-19 were 4.5%, 10.0% and 85.6%, respectively. The majority of participants showed absolute or moderate trust in the Greek health authorities for the management of the epidemic (90.1%), as well as in the Greek Government (84.7%) and the official national sources of information (87.4%). Trust in the authorities was weaker in younger participants and those who joined the study after the lifting of lockdown measures (p-value[&le;]0.001). None of the factors examined was associated with participants level of knowledge after correction for multiple testing.

ConclusionsHigh level of knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic and trust in the Greek authorities was observed, possibly due to the plethora of good quality publicly available information and the timely management of the pandemic at its early stages in Greece. Information campaigns for the COVID-19 pandemic should be encouraged even after the lifting of lockdown measures to increase public awareness.","Kanellopoulou, A.; Koskeridis, F.; Markozannes, G.; Bouras, E.; Soutziou, C.; Chaliasos, K.; Doumas, M.

8491,Mortality rate and estimate of fraction of undiagnosed COVID-19 cases in the US in March and April 2020,"We use a simple model to derive a mortality probability distribution for a patient as a function of days since diagnosis (considering diagnoses made between 25 February and 29 March 2020). The peak of the mortality probability is the 13th day after diagnosis. The overall shape and peak location of this probability curve are similar to the onset-to-death probability distribution in a case study using Chinese data.

The total mortality probability of a COVID-19 patient in the US diagnosed between 25 February and 29 March is about 21%. We speculate that this high value is caused by severe under-testing of the population to identify all COVID-19 patients. With this probability, and an assumption that the true probability is 2.4%, we estimate that 89% of all SARS-CoV-2 infection cases were not diagnosed during this period.

When the same method is applied to data extended to 25 April, we found that the total mortality probability of a patient diagnosed in the US after 1 April is about 6.4%, significantly lower than for the earlier period. We attribute this drop to increasingly available tests.

9114,Anemia and iron metabolism in COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Iron metabolism and anemia may play an important role in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). If confirmed, this has important implications for the more than 1.62 billion people estimated to have anemia globally. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate biomarkers of anemia and iron metabolism (hemoglobin, ferritin, transferrin, soluble transferrin receptor, hepcidin, haptoglobin, unsaturated iron-binding capacity, erythropoietin, free erythrocyte protoporphyrine, and prevalence of anemia) in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and explore their prognostic value. Six bibliographic databases were searched up to May 5th 2020. We included 56 unique studies, with data from 14,044 COVID-19 patients (59 years median age). Pooled mean hemoglobin and ferritin levels in COVID-19 patients across all ages were 130.41 g/L (95% Confidence Interval (CI), 128.42; 132.39) and 673.91 ng/mL (95% CI, 420.98; 926.84), respectively. Hemoglobin levels decreased with advancing age and increasing percentage of comorbid and critically ill patients, while levels of ferritin increased with increasing male proportion and mean hemoglobin levels. Compared to moderate cases, severe cases had lower pooled mean hemoglobin [weighted mean difference (WMD), -4.21 (95% CI -6.63; -1.78)] and higher ferritin [WMD, -730.55 ng/mL (95% CI 413.24; 1047.85)]. A significant difference in mean ferritin level of 1027.23 ng/mL (95% CI 819.53; 1234.94) was found between survivors and non-survivors, but not in hemoglobin levels. No studies provided information on anemia or other biomarkers of interest. Future studies should explore the impact of iron metabolism and anemia and in the pathophysiology, prognosis, and treatment of COVID-19.","Taneri, P. E.; Gomez-Ochoa, S. A.; Llanaj, E.; Raguindin, P.

18310,Tracking and predicting the African COVID-19 pandemic,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is heterogeneous throughout Africa and threatening millions of lives. Surveillance and short-term modeling forecasts are critical to provide timely information for decisions on control strategies. We use a model that explains the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic over time in the entire African continent, parameterized by socioeconomic and geoeconomic variations and the lagged effects of social policy and meteorological history. We observed the effect of the human development index, containment policies, testing capacity, specific humidity, temperature and landlocked status of countries on the local within-country and external between-country transmission. One week forecasts of case numbers from the model were driven by the quality of the reported data. Seeking equitable behavioral and social interventions, balanced with coordinated country-specific strategies in infection suppression, should be a continental priority to control the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa.","Ssentongo, P.; Fronterre, C.; Geronimo, A.; Greybush, S.

18420,Characteristic of IgA and IgG antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in an Italian referral Covid-19 Hospital,"IntroductionAntibody response play a fundamental role in the natural history of infectious disease. A better understanding of the immune response in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection could be important for identifying patients at greater risk of developing a more severe form of disease and with a worse prognosis.

MethodsWe performed a cross-sectional analysis to determine the presence and the levels of both anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA in a cohort of hospitalized patients with confirmed infection at different times in the natural history of the disease. Patients enrolled when admitted at the emergency department were prospectively followed up during hospital stay.

ResultsOverall, 131 patients were considered with a total of 237 samples processed. Cross-sectional analysis showed that seroconversion for IgA seems to occur between days 5 and 15 while IgG response seems to occur slightly later, peaking at day 20 after symptoms onset. Both IgA and IgG were maintained beyond two months. Severe patients showed a higher IgA response compared with mild patients when analyzing optical density (8.3 versus 5.6, p < 0.001). Prospective analysis conducted on 55 patients confirmed that IgA appear slightly earlier than IgG. After stratifying for the severity of disease, both the IgA and IgG response was more vigorous in severe cases. Moreover, while IgG tended to stabilize, there was a relevant decline after the first month of IgA levels in mild cases.

ConclusionIgA and IgG antibody response is closely related although seroconversion for IgA occurs earlier. Both IgA and IgG are maintained beyond two months. Severe patients showed a more vigorous IgA and IgG response. IgA levels seem to decline after one month since the onset of symptoms in mild cases.","Carnicelli, A.; Fiori, B.; Ricci, R.; Piano, A.; Bonadia, N.; Taddei, E.; Fantoni, M.; Murri, R.; Cingolani, A.; Barillaro, C.; Cutuli, S.

22191,Longitudinal Metabolomics of Human Plasma Reveals Robust Prognostic Markers of COVID-19 Disease Severity,"There is an urgent need to identify which COVID-19 patients will develop life-threatening illness so that scarce medical resources can be optimally allocated and rapid treatment can be administered early in the disease course, when clinical management is most effective. To aid in the prognostic classification of disease severity, we performed untargeted metabolomics profiling of 341 patients with plasma samples collected at six longitudinal time points. Using the temporal metabolic profiles and machine learning, we then built a predictive model of disease severity. We determined that the levels of 25 metabolites measured at the time of hospital admission successfully predict future disease severity. Through analysis of longitudinal samples, we confirmed that these prognostic markers are directly related to disease progression and that their levels are restored to baseline upon disease recovery. Finally, we validated that these metabolites are also altered in a hamster model of COVID-19. Our results indicate that metabolic changes associated with COVID-19 severity can be effectively used to stratify patients and inform resource allocation during the pandemic.","Sindelar, M.; Stancliffe, E.; Schwaiger-Haber, M.; Anbukumar, D.

8837,Cytokine biomarkers of COVID-19,"We used a new strategy to screen cytokines associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cytokines that can classify populations in different states of SARS-CoV-2 infection were first screened in cross-sectional serum samples from 184 subjects by 2 statistical analyses. The resultant cytokines were then analyzed for their interrelationships and fluctuating features in sequential samples from 38 COVID-19 patients. Three cytokines, M-CSF, IL-8 and SCF, which were clustered into 3 different correlation groups and had relatively small fluctuations during SARS-CoV-2 infection, were selected for the construction of a multiclass classification model. This model discriminated healthy individuals and asymptomatic and nonsevere patients with accuracy of 77.4% but was not successful in classifying severe patients. Further searching led to a single cytokine, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which classified severe from nonsevere COVID-19 patients with a sensitivity of 84.6% and a specificity of 97.9% under a cutoff value of 1128 pg/ml. The level of this cytokine did not increase in nonsevere patients but was significantly elevated in severe patients. Considering its potent antiinflammatory function, we suggest that HGF might be a new candidate therapy for critical COVID-19. In addition, our new strategy provides not only a rational and effective way to focus on certain cytokine biomarkers for infectious diseases but also a new opportunity to probe the modulation of cytokines in the immune response.","Deng, H.-J.; Long, Q.-X.; Liu, B.-Z.; Ren, J.-H.; Liao, P.; Qiu, J.-F.; Tang, X.-J.; Zhang, Y.; Tang, N.; Xu, Y.-Y.; Mo, Z.; Chen, J.; Hu, J.; Huang, A.-L.",2020-06-03,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.31.20118315,1,Juan Chen,"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.31.20118315v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.31.20118315v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
19864,"Active vaccine safety surveillance via a scalable, integrated system in Australian pharmacies.","IntroductionActive vaccine safety surveillance will be critical to COVID-19 vaccine deployment. Pharmacists have been identified as potential immunisers in COVID-19 policies, yet there are no reported active surveillance systems operating in pharmacies. We integrated an established participant-centred active vaccine safety surveillance system with a cloud-based pharmacy immunisation-recording program. We measured adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) reported via the new surveillance system in pharmacies, and compared these to AEFI reported via an existing surveillance system in non-pharmacy sites (general practice and other clinics).

MethodsA prospective cohort study of individuals>10 years receiving influenza immunisations from 22 pharmacies and 90 non-pharmacy sites between March and October, 2020, in Australia. Active surveillance was conducted using SMS and smartphone technology, via an opt-out system. Multivariable logistic regression (including a subgroup analysis of participants over 65 years) was used to assess differences in proportions of AEFI between participants immunised in pharmacies compared to non-pharmacy sites, adjusting for confounders of age, sex, and influenza vaccine brand.

ResultsOf 101,440 influenza immunisation participants (6,992 from pharmacies; 94,448 from non-pharmacy sites), 77,498 (76.4%) responded; 96.1% (n=74,448) within 24 hours. Overall, 4.8% (n=247) pharmacy participants reported an AEFI, compared with 6.0% (n=4,356) non-pharmacy participants (adjusted odds ratio: 0.87; 95% confidence interval: 0.76 to 0.99; p=0.039). Similar proportions of AEFIs were reported in pharmacy (5.8%; n=31) and non-pharmacy participants (6.0; n=1617) aged over 65 years (adjusted odds ratio: 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.65 to 1.35; p=0.725).

ConclusionHigh and rapid response rates demonstrate good participant engagement with active surveillance in both pharmacy and non-pharmacy participants. Significantly fewer AEFIs reported after pharmacist immunisations compared to non-pharmacy immunisations, with no difference in older adults, suggests different cohorts attend pharmacy and non-pharmacy immunisers. The integrated pharmacy system is rapidly scalable across Australia with global potential.

27822,"A Novel and Expanding SARS-CoV-2 Variant, B.1.1.318, dominates infections in Mauritius","Mauritius, a small island in the Indian Ocean, has had a unique experience of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In March 2020, Mauritius endured a small first wave and quickly implemented control measures which allowed elimination of local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. When borders to the island reopened, it was accompanied by mandatory quarantine and testing of incoming passengers to avoid reintroduction of the virus into the community. As variants of concern (VOCs) emerged elsewhere in the world, Mauritius began using genomic surveillance to keep track of quarantined cases of these variants. In March 2021, another local outbreak occurred, and sequencing was used to investigate this new wave of local infections. Here, we analyze 154 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from Mauritius, which represent 12% of all the infections seem in Mauritius, these were both from specimens of incoming passengers before March 2021 and those of cases during the second wave. Our findings indicate that despite the presence of known VOCs Beta (B.1.351) and Alpha (B.1.1.7) among quarantined passengers, the second wave of local SARS-CoV-2 infections in Mauritius was caused by a single introduction and dominant circulation of the B.1.1.318 virus. The B.1.1.318 variant is characterized by fourteen non-synonymous mutations in the S-gene, with five encoded amino acid substitutions (T95I, E484K, D614G, P681H, D796H) and one deletion (Y144del) in the Spike glycoprotein. This variant seems to be increasing in prevalence and it is now present in 34 countries. This study highlights that despite having stopped the introduction of more transmissible VOCs by travel quarantines, a single undetected introduction of a B.1.1.318 lineage virus was enough to initiate a large local outbreak in Mauritius and demonstrated the need for continuous genomic surveillance to fully inform public health decisions.","Tegally, H.; Ramuth, M.; Amoaka, D.; Scheepers, C.; Wilkinson, E.; Giovanetti, M.; Lessells, R.

5299,Clinical evaluation of an immunochromatographic IgM/IgG antibody assay and chest computed tomography for the diagnosis of COVID-19,"BackgroundWe evaluated the clinical performance of an immunochromatographic (IC) IgM/IgG antibody assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) and chest computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

MethodsWe examined 139 serum specimens collected from 112 patients with COVID-19 and 48 serum specimens collected from 48 non-COVID-19 patients. The presence of IgM/IgG antibody for SARS-CoV2 was determined using the One Step Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG Antibody Test. Chest CT was performed in COVID-19 patients on admission.

FindingsOf the139 COVID-19 serum specimens, IgM was detected in 27.8%, 48.0%, and 95.8% of the specimens collected within 1 week, 1-2 weeks, and >2 weeks after symptom onset and IgG was detected in 3.3%, 8.0%, and 62.5%, respectively. Among the 48 non-COVID-19 serum specimens, 1 generated a false-positive result for IgM. Thirty-eight of the 112 COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, of whom 15 were positive for IgM, and 74 were symptomatic, of whom 22 were positive for IgM and 7 were positive for IgG. The diagnostic sensitivity of CT scan alone and in combination with the IC assay was 57.9 % (22/38) and 68.4% (26/38) for the asymptomatic patients and 74.3% (55/74) and 82.4% (61/74) for the symptomatic patients, respectively.

ConclusionThe IC assay had low sensitivity during the early phase of infection, and thus IC assay alone is not recommended for initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19. If RT-qPCR is not available, the combination of chest CT and IC assay may be useful for diagnosing COVID-19.","Imai, K.; Tabata, S.; Ikeda, M.; Noguchi, S.; Kitagawa, Y.; Matuoka, M.; Miyoshi, K.; Tarumoto, N.; Sakai, J.; Ito, T.; Maesaki, S.; Tamura, K.; Maeda, T.",2020-04-27,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.22.20075564,1,Kazuo Imai,Saitama Medical University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20075564v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20075564v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104393

MethodsWe conducted a prospective study of 6-month outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients with new neurological complications during hospitalization who survived were propensity score-matched to COVID-19 survivors without neurological complications hospitalized during the same period. The primary 6-month outcome was multivariable ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin Scale(mRS) comparing patients with or without neurological complications. Secondary outcomes included: activities of daily living (ADLs;Barthel Index), telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Neuro-QoL batteries for anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep.

ResultsOf 606 COVID-19 patients with neurological complications, 395 survived hospitalization and were matched to 395 controls; N=196 neurological patients and N=186 controls completed follow-up. Overall, 346/382 (91%) patients had at least one abnormal outcome: 56% had limited ADLs, 50% impaired cognition, 47% could not return to work and 62% scored worse than average on [&ge;]1 Neuro-QoL scale (worse anxiety 46%, sleep 38%, fatigue 36%, and depression 25%). In multivariable analysis, patients with neurological complications had worse 6-month mRS (median 4 vs. 3 among controls, adjusted OR 2.03, 95%CI 1.22-3.40, P=0.01), worse ADLs (aOR 0.38, 95%CI 0.29-0.74, P=0.01) and were less likely to return to work than controls (41% versus 64%, P=0.04).

6271,"Effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on Maternal, Perinatal and Neonatal Outcomes: a Systematic Review of 266 Pregnancies","ObjectiveTo perform a systematic review of available published literature on pregnancies affected by COVID-19 to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes.

MethodsWe performed a systematic review to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy, perinatal and neonatal outcomes. We conducted a comprehensive literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database and Wan Fang Data until April 20, 2020 (studies were identified through PubMed alert after April 20, 2020). For the research strategy, combinations of the following keywords and MeSH terms were used: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019, pregnancy, gestation, maternal, mothers, vertical transmission, maternal-fetal transmission, intrauterine transmission, neonates, infant, delivery. Eligibility criteria included laboratory-confirmed and/or clinically diagnosed COVID-19, patient was pregnant on admission, availability of clinical characteristics, including maternal, perinatal or neonatal outcomes. Exclusion criteria were unpublished reports, unspecified date and location of the study or suspicion of duplicate reporting, and unreported maternal or perinatal outcomes. No language restrictions were applied.

ResultsWe identified several case-reports and case-series but only 19 studies, including a total of 266 pregnant women with COVID-19, met eligibility criteria and were finally included in the review. In the combined data from seven case-series, the maternal age ranged from 20 to 41 years and the gestational age on admission ranged from 5 to 41 weeks. The most common symptoms at presentation were fever, cough, dyspnea/shortness of breath and fatigue. The rate of severe pneumonia was relatively low, with the majority of the cases requiring intensive care unit admission. Almost all cases from the case-series had positive computer tomography chest findings. There were six and 22 cases that had nucleic-acid testing in vaginal mucus and breast milk samples, respectively, which were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Only a few cases had spontaneous miscarriage or abortion. 177 cases had delivered, of which the majority by Cesarean section. The gestational age at delivery ranged from 28 to 41 weeks. Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes ranged from 7 to 10 and 8 to 10, respectively. A few neonates had birthweight less than 2500 grams and over one-third of cases were transferred to neonatal intensive care unit. There was one case each of neonatal asphyxia and neonatal death. There were 113 neonates that had nucleic-acid testing in throat swab, which was negative for SARS-CoV-2. From the case-reports, two maternal deaths among pregnant women with COVID-19 were reported.

ConclusionsThe clinical characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 are similar to those of nonpregnant adults with COVID-19. Currently, there is no evidence that pregnant women with COVID-19 are more prone to develop severe pneumonia, in comparison to nonpregnant patients. The subject of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial and more data is needed to investigate this possibility. Most importantly, in order to collect meaningful pregnancy and perinatal outcome data, we urge researchers and investigators to reference previously published cases in their publications and to record such reporting when the data of a case is being entered into a registry or several registries.

ContributionO_ST_ABSWhat are the novel findings of this work?C_ST_ABSAmongst a few cases from the case-series that had qRT-PCR testing in vaginal mucus and breast milks, the results were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, some of the cases from the case-series had qRT-PCR testing in amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab and neonatal feces, and the results were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Amongst the case-reports, there were two maternal deaths and two neonates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at 16 / 24 hours of life.

What are the clinical implications of this work?The subject of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial and more data is needed to investigate this possibility. In order to collect meaningful pregnancy and perinatal outcome data, we urge researchers and investigators to reference previously published cases in their publications and to record such reporting when the data of a case is being entered into a registry or several registries.","Juan, J.; Gil, M.

23692,Model Based Estimation of the SARS-CoV-2 Immunization Level in Austria and Consequences for Herd Immunity Effects,"Several systemic factors indicate, that worldwide herd immunity against COVID-19 will probably not be achieved in 2021. Vaccination programs are limited by availability of doses, the number of people already infected is still too low to have a disease preventing impact and new emerging variants of the virus seem to partially neglect developed antibodies from previous infections. Nevertheless, after one year of COVID-19 observing high numbers of reported cases in most European countries, we might expect that the immunization level should have an impact on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We used an agent-based simulation model to reproduce the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria to estimate the immunization level of the population as of February 2021. We ran several simulations of an uncontrolled epidemic wave with varying initial immunization scenarios to assess the effect on the effective reproduction number. We also used a classic differential equation SIR-model to cross-validate the simulation model. As of February 2021, 14.7% of the Austrian population has been affected by a SARS-CoV-2 infection which causes a 9% reduction of the effective reproduction number and a 24.7% reduction of the prevalence peak compared to a fully susceptible population. This estimation is now recomputed on a regular basis to publish model based analysis of immunization level in Austria also including the fast growing effects of vaccination programs. This provides substantial information for decision makers to evaluate the necessity of NPI-measures based on the estimated impact of natural and vaccinated immunization.","Bicher, M.

10409,The validation of the original and modified Caprini score in COVID-19 patients,"ObjectiveThe study aimed to validate the original Caprini score and its modifications considering coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a severe prothrombotic condition in patients admitted to the hospital with confirmed infection.

MethodsThe relevant data were extracted from the electronic medical records with the implemented Caprini score and were evaluated retrospectively. The score was calculated twice: by the physician at the admission and by the investigator at discharge or after death. The second calculation at discharge, considered additional risk factors that occurred during inpatient treatment. Besides the original Caprini score (a version of 2005), the modified version added the elevation of D-dimer and specific scores for COVID-19 as follows: 2 points for asymptomatic, 3 points for symptomatic and 5 points for symptomatic infection with positive D-dimer, were evaluated in a retrospective manner. The primary endpoint was symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) confirmed by appropriate imaging testing or dissection. The secondary endpoint included the unfavorable outcome as a combination of symptomatic VTE, admission to the intensive care unit, the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation, and death. The association of eight different versions of the Caprini score with outcomes was evaluated.

ResultsTotally 168 patients (83 males and 85 females at the age of 58.3{+/-}12.7 years old) were admitted to the hospital between April 30 and May 29, 2020, and were discharged or died up to the time of data analysis. The original Caprini score varied between 2-12 (5.4{+/-}1.8) at the admission and between 2-15 (5.9{+/-}2.5) at discharge or death. The presence of the virus increased these scores and resulted in an increased score with the maximal value for those including COVID-19 points (10.0{+/-}3.0). Patients received prophylactic (2.4%), intermediate (76.8%), or therapeutic (20.8%) doses of enoxaparin. Despite this, the symptomatic VTE was detected in 11 (6.5%) and unfavorable outcomes in 31 (18.5%) patients. The Caprini score of all eight versions demonstrated a significant association with VTE with the highest predictability for the original scale when assessed at discharge. Supplementation of the original score by elevated D-dimer improved predictability only at the admission. Four versions of the Caprini score calculated at the admission had a significant correlation with the unfavorable outcome with the minor advantages of specific COVID-19 points.

ConclusionThe study identified a significant correlation between the Caprini score and the risk of VTE or unfavorable outcomes in COVID-19 patients. All models, including specific COVID-19 scores, showed high predictability with minor differences.

Key FindingsThe original version of the Caprini score and its modifications considering the elevation of D-dimer and specific COVID-19 points demonstrated a significant association with symptomatic VTE and unfavorable outcome in 168 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, of whom 6.5% developed symptomatic VTE and 18.5% - unfavorable outcome despite routine pharmacoprophylaxis.

Take Home MessageThe Caprini score allows stratification of COVID-19 inpatients according to their VTE risk and identification of subjects at extremely high risk.

TABLE OF CONTENTS SUMMARYThis retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data demonstrates the significant association between the original and modified Caprini score and symptomatic VTE or unfavorable outcome in 168 patients with confirmed COVID-19. The Caprini score may be used for VTE risk assessment, and identification of persons at extremely high risk among COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital.","Tsaplin, S.; Schastlivtsev, I.; Lobastov, K.; Zhuravlev, S.; Barinov, V.; Caprini, J.",2020-06-23,Surgery,10.1101/2020.06.22.20137075,1,Kirill Lobastov,Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.20137075v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.20137075v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
6311,On the progression of COVID19 in Portugal: A comparative analysis of active cases using non-linear regression,"Portugal has been portrayed as a relatively successful case in the control of the COVID-19s March 2020 outbreak in Europe due to the timely confinement measures taken. As other European Union member states, Portugal is now preparing the phased loosening of the confinement measures, starting in the beginning of May. Even so, the current data, albeit showing at least a reduction in infection rates, renders difficult to forecast scenarios in the imminent future. Using South Korea data as scaffold, which is becoming a paradigmatic case of recovery following a high number of infected people, we fitted Portuguese data to biphasic models using non-linear regression and compared the two countries. The results, which suggest good fit, show that recovery in Portugal can be much slower than anticipated, with a very high percentage of active cases (over 50%) remaining still active even months after the projected end of mitigation measures. This, together with the unknown number of asymptomatic carriers, may increase the risk of a much slower recovery if not of new outbreaks. Europe and elsewhere must consider this contingency when planning the relief of containment measures.","Milhinhos, A.; Costa, P. M.",2020-05-06,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.02.20088856,1,Pedro M.

8396,A reductive analysis of a compartmental model for COVID-19: data assimilation and forecasting for the United Kingdom,"We introduce a deterministic model that partitions the total population into the susceptible, infected, quarantined, and those traced after exposure, the recovered and the deceased. We hypothesize  accessible population for transmission of the disease to be a small fraction of the total population, for instance when interventions are in force. This hypothesis, together with the structure of the set of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the populations, allows us to decouple the equations into just two equations. This further reduces to a logistic type of equation for the total infected population. The equation can be solved analytically and therefore allows for a clear interpretation of the growth and inhibiting factors in terms of the parameters in the full model. The validity of the  accessible population hypothesis and the efficacy of the reduced logistic model is demonstrated by the ease of fitting the United Kingdom data for the cumulative infected and daily new infected cases. The model can also be used to forecast further progression of the disease. In an effort to find optimized parameter values compatible with the United Kingdom coronavirus data, we first determine the relative importance of the various transition rates participating in the original model. Using this we show that the original model equations provide a very good fit with the United Kingdom data for the cumulative number of infections and the daily new cases. The fact that the model calculated daily new cases exhibits a turning point, suggests the beginning of a slow-down in the spread of infections. However, since the rate of slowing down beyond the turning point is small, the cumulative number of infections is likely to saturate to about 3.52 x 105 around late July, provided the lock-down conditions continue to prevail. Noting that the fit obtained from the reduced logistic equation is comparable to that with the full model equations, the underlying causes for the limited forecasting ability of the reduced logistic equation are elucidated. The model and the procedure adopted here are expected to be useful in fitting the data for other countries and in forecasting the progression of the disease.","Ananthakrishna, G.; Kumar, J.",2020-06-08,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.27.20114868,3,Garani Ananthakrishna,"Materials Research Centre, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru 560012, India",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.20114868v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.20114868v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,"NA"
9056,Dynamics of COVID-19 under social distancing measures are driven by transmission network structure,"In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions, social distancing is being used worldwide to curb the spread of COVID-19. The impact of these measures has been inconsistent, with some regions rapidly nearing disease elimination and others seeing delayed peaks or nearly flat epidemic curves. Here we build a stochastic epidemic model to examine the effects of COVID-19 clinical progression and transmission network structure on the outcomes of social distancing interventions. Our simulations show that long delays between the adoption of control measures and observed declines in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths occur in many scenarios. We find that the strength of within-household transmission is a critical determinant of success, governing the timing and size of the epidemic peak, the rate of decline, individual risks of infection, and the success of partial relaxation measures. The structure of residual external connections, driven by workforce participation and essential businesses, interacts to determine outcomes. We suggest limited conditions under which the formation of household """"bubbles"""" can be safe. These findings can improve future predictions of the timescale and efficacy of interventions needed to control second waves of COVID-19 as well as other similar outbreaks, and highlight the need for better quantification and control of household transmission.

Author SummarySocial distancing is the main tool used to control COVID-19, and involves reducing contacts that could potentially transmit infection with strategies like school closures, work-from-home policies, mask-wearing, or lockdowns. These measures have been applied around the world, but in situations where they have suppressed infections, the effect has not been immediate or consistent. In this study we use a mathematical model to simulate the spread and control of COVID-19, tracking the different settings of person-to-person contact (e.g. household, school, workplace) and the different clinical stages an infected individual may pass through before recovery or death. We find that there are often long delays between when strong social distancing policies are adopted and when cases, hospitalizations, and deaths peak and begin to decline. Moreover, we find that the amount of transmission that happens within versus outside the household is critical to determining when social distancing can be effective and the delay until the epidemic peak. We show how the interaction between unmitigated households spread and residual external connections due to essential activities impacts individual risk and population infection levels. These results can be used to better predict the impact of future interventions to control COVID-19 or similar outbreaks","Nande, A.; Adlam, B.; Sheen, J.; Levy, M. Z.; Hill, A.

18555,Cov-MS: a community-based template assay for clinical MS-based protein detection in Sars-Cov-2 patients,"Rising population density and global mobility are among the reasons why pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, spread so rapidly across the globe. The policy response to such pandemics will always have to include accurate monitoring of the spread, as this provides one of the few alternatives to total lockdown. However, COVID-19 diagnosis is currently performed almost exclusively by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Although this is efficient, automatable and acceptably cheap, reliance on one type of technology comes with serious caveats, as illustrated by recurring reagent and test shortages. We therefore developed an alternative diagnostic test that detects proteolytically digested SARS-CoV-2 proteins using Mass Spectrometry (MS). We established the Cov-MS consortium, consisting of fifteen academic labs and several industrial partners to increase applicability, accessibility, sensitivity and robustness of this kind of SARS-CoV-2 detection. This in turn gave rise to the Cov-MS Digital Incubator that allows other labs to join the effort, navigate and share their optimizations, and translate the assay into their clinic. As this test relies on viral proteins instead of RNA, it provides an orthogonal and complementary approach to RT-PCR, using other reagents that are relatively inexpensive and widely available, as well as orthogonally skilled personnel and different instruments. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD022550.","Van Puyvelde, B.; Van Uytfanghe, K.; Tytgat, O.; Van Oudenhove, L.; Gabriels, R.; Bouwmeester, R.; Daled, S.; Van Den Bossche, T.; Ramasamy, P.; Verhelst, S.; De Clerck, L.; Corveleyn, L.; Debunne, N.; Wynendaele, E.; De Spiegeleer, B.; Judak, P.; Roels, K.; De Wilde, L.; Van Eenoo, P.; Reyns, T.; Cherlet, M.; Dumont, E.; Debyser, G.; T'kindt, R.; Sandra, K.; Gupta, S.; Drouin, N.; Harms, A.; Hankemeier, T.; Jones, D.; Gupta, P.; Lane, C.; El Ouadi, S.; Vincendet, J.-B.; Morrice, N.; Oehrle, S.; Tanna, N.; Silvester, S.; Hannam, S.; Sigloch, F.; Bhangu-Uhlmann, A.; Claereboudt, J.; Razavi, M.;",2020-11-20,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.11.18.20231688,1,Maarten Dhaenens,"ProGenTomics, Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Ghent University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.18.20231688v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.18.20231688v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,"NA"
7972,COVID-19: Effects of environmental conditions on the propagation of respiratory droplets,"As Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread, a detailed understanding on the transmission mechanisms is of paramount importance. The disease transmits mainly through respiratory droplets and aerosol. Although models for the evaporation and trajectory of respiratory droplets have been developed, how the environment impacts the transmission of COVID-19 is still unclear. In this study, we investigate the propagation of respiratory droplets and aerosol particles generated by speech under a wide range of temperature (0 {degrees}C to 40 {degrees}C) and relative humidity (0% to 92%) conditions. We show that droplets can travel three times farther in low temperature and high humidity environment, while the amount of aerosol increases in high temperature and low humidity environment. The results also underscore the importance of proper ventilation, as droplets and aerosol spread significantly farther in airstreams.

We quantified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater influent and primary settled solids in two wastewater treatment plants to inform the pre-analytical and analytical approaches, and to assess whether influent or solids harbored more viral targets. The primary settled solids samples resulted in higher SARS-CoV-2 detection frequencies than the corresponding influent samples. Likewise, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was more readily detected in solids using one-step digital droplet (dd)RT-PCR than with two-step RT-QPCR and two-step ddRT-PCR, likely owing to reduced inhibition with the one-step ddRT-PCR assay. We subsequently analyzed a longitudinal time series of 89 settled solids samples from a single plant for SARS-CoV-2 RNA as well as coronavirus recovery (bovine coronavirus) and fecal strength (pepper mild mottle virus, PMMoV) controls. SARS-CoV-2 RNA targets N1 and N2 concentrations correlate positively and significantly with COVID-19 clinical confirmed case counts in the sewershed. Together, the results demonstrate that measuring SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in settled solids may be a more sensitive approach than measuring SARs-CoV-2 in influent.","Graham, K.; Loeb, S.; Wolfe, M.; Catoe, D.; Sinnott-Armstrong, N.; Kim, S.; Yamahara, K.; Sassoubre, L.; Mendoza, L.; Roldan-Hernandez, L.; Li, L.; Wigginton, K.; Boehm, A.",2020-09-15,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.09.14.20194472,1,Alexandria Boehm,Stanford University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.14.20194472v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.14.20194472v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1021/acs.est.0c06191

All patients, including asymptomatic patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition to a qualitative answer, providing viral load values to the RT-PCR results not only helped the clinician to evaluate the stage of the infection but addressed patient contagiousness and guided infection control decisions.

20017,Lessons learned from Vietnam's COVID-19 response: the role of adaptive behavior change and testing in epidemic control,"BackgroundVietnam has emerged as one of the worlds leading success stories in responding to COVID-19. After prolonged zero-low transmission, a summer outbreak of unknown source at Da Nang caused the countrys first COVID-19 deaths, but was quickly suppressed. Vietnam recently reopened its borders to international travelers. Understanding the attendant risks and how to minimize them is crucial as Vietnam moves into this new phase.

MethodsWe create an agent-based model of COVID-19 in Vietnam, using regional testing data and a detailed linelist of the 1,014 COVID-19 cases, including 35 deaths, identified across Vietnam. We investigate the Da Nang outbreak, and quantify the risk of another outbreak under different assumptions about behavioral/policy responses and ongoing testing.

ResultsThe Da Nang outbreak, although rapidly contained once detected, nevertheless caused significant community transmission before it was detected; higher symptomatic testing could have mitigated this. If testing levels do not increase, the adoption of past policies in response to newly-detected cases may reduce the size of potential outbreaks but will not prevent them. Compared to a baseline symptomatic testing rate of 10%, we estimate half as many infections under a 20% testing rate, and a quarter as many with 40-50% testing rates, over the four months following border reopenings.

ConclusionsVietnams success in controlling COVID-19 is largely attributable to its rapid response to detected outbreaks, but the speed of response could be improved even further with higher levels of symptomatic testing.","Pham, Q.

17952,Seroprevalence of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in a Cohort of New York City Metro Blood Donors using Multiple SARS-CoV-2 Serological Assays: Implications for Controlling the Epidemic and Reopening.,"Projections of the stage of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and local, regional and national public health policies designed to limit the spread of the epidemic as well as """"reopen"""" cities and states, are best informed by serum neutralizing antibody titers measured by reproducible, high throughput, and statically credible antibody (Ab) assays. To date, a myriad of Ab tests, both available and authorized for emergency use by the FDA, has led to confusion rather than insight per se. The present study reports the results of a rapid, point-in-time 1,000-person cohort study using serial blood donors in the New York City metropolitan area (NYC) using multiple serological tests, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and high throughput serological assays (HTSAs). These were then tested and associated with assays for neutralizing Ab (NAb). Of the 1,000 NYC blood donor samples in late June and early July 2020, 12.1% and 10.9% were seropositive using the Ortho Total Ig and the Abbott IgG HTSA assays, respectively. These serological assays correlated with neutralization activity specific to SARS-CoV-2. The data reported herein suggest that seroconversion in this population occurred in approximately 1 in 8 blood donors from the beginning of the pandemic in NYC (considered March 1, 2020). These findings deviate with an earlier seroprevalence study in NYC showing 13.7% positivity. Collectively however, these data demonstrate that a low number of individuals have serologic evidence of infection during this """"first wave"""" and suggest that the notion of """"herd immunity"""" at rates of [~]60% or higher are not near. Furthermore, the data presented herein show that the nature of the Ab-based immunity is not invariably associated with the development of NAb. While the blood donor population may not mimic precisely the NYC population as a whole, rapid assessment of seroprevalence in this cohort and serial reassessment could aid public health decision making.","Jin, D.

7706,"Comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory findings, imaging features, treatment strategies, and outcomes in adult and pediatric patients with COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis","IntroductionSince December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a world-wide pandemic with an enormous medical, societal, and economic toll. Thus, our aim was to gather all available information regarding comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, outcomes, laboratory findings, imaging features, and treatments in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

MethodsEMBASE, PubMed/ Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for studies published in any language between December 1st, 2019 and March 28th. Original studies were included if the exposure of interest was an infection with SARS-CoV-2 or confirmed COVID-19. The primary outcome was the risk ratio of comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, imaging features, treatments, outcomes, and complications associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. We performed random-effects pairwise meta-analyses for proportions and relative risks, I2, Tau2, and Cochrane Q, sensitivity analyses, and assessed publication bias.

Results148 met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review and meta-analysis with 12149 patients (5739 female) and a median age was 47.0 [35.0-64.6]. 617 patients died from COVID-19 and its complication, while 297 patients were reported as asymptomatic.

The heterogeneity between studies varied substantially (I2; range: 1.5-98.2%). Publication bias was only found in eight studies (Eggers test: p < 0.05).

13956,Examining the status of improved air quality due to COVID-19 lockdown and an associated reduction in anthropogenic emissions,"Clean air is a fundamental necessity for human health and well-being. The COVID-19 lockdown worldwide resulted in controls on anthropogenic emission that have a significant synergistic effect on air quality ecosystem services (ESs). This study utilised both satellite and surface monitored measurements to estimate air pollution for 20 cities across the world. Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) data were used for evaluating tropospheric air quality status during the lockdown period. Surface measurement data were retrieved from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, USA) for a more explicit assessment of air quality ESs. Google Earth Engine TROPOMI application was utilised for a time series assessment of air pollution during the lockdown (1 Feb to 11 May 2020) compared with the lockdown equivalent periods (1 Feb to 11 May 2019). The economic valuation for air pollution reduction services was measured using two approaches: (1) median externality value coefficient approach; and (2) public health burden approach. Human mobility data from Apple (for city-scale) and Google (for country scale) was used for examining the connection between human interferences on air quality ESs. Using satellite data, the spatial and temporal concentration of four major pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and the aerosol index (AI) were measured. For NO2, the highest reduction was found in Paris (46%), followed by Detroit (40%), Milan (37%), Turin (37%), Frankfurt (36%), Philadelphia (34%), London (34%), and Madrid (34%), respectively. At the same time, a comparably lower reduction of NO2 is observed in Los Angeles (11%), Sao Paulo (17%), Antwerp (24%), Tehran (25%), and Rotterdam (27%), during the lockdown period. Using the adjusted value coefficients, the economic value of the air quality ESs was calculated for different pollutants. Using the public health burden valuation method, the highest economic benefits due to the reduced anthropogenic emission (for NO2) was estimated in US$ for New York (501M $), followed by London (375M $), Chicago (137M $), Paris (124M $), Madrid (90M $), Philadelphia (89M $), Milan (78M $), Cologne (67M $), Los Angeles (67M $), Frankfurt (52M $), Turin (45M $), Detroit (43M $), Barcelona (41M $), Sao Paulo (40M $), Tehran (37M $), Denver (30M $), Antwerp (16M $), Utrecht (14 million $), Brussels (9 million $), Rotterdam (9 million $), respectively. In this study, the public health burden and median externality valuation approaches were adopted for the economic valuation and subsequent interpretation. This one dimension and linear valuation may not be able to track the overall economic impact of air pollution on human welfare. Therefore, research that broadens the scope of valuation in environmental capitals needs to be initiated for exploring the importance of proper monetary valuation in natural capital accounting.","Sannigrahi, S.; Molter, A.; Kumar, P.; Zhang, Q.; Basu, B.; Basu, A.

23017,A statewide analysis of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in New York,"New York State, in particular the New York City metropolitan area, was the early epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the United States. Similar to initial pandemic dynamics in many metropolitan areas, multiple introductions from various locations appear to have contributed to the swell of positive cases. However, representation and analysis of samples from New York regions outside the greater New York City area were lacking, as were SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the earliest cases associated with the Westchester County outbreak, which represents the first outbreak recorded in New York State. The Wadsworth Center, the public health laboratory of New York State, sought to characterize the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 across the entire state of New York from March to September with the addition of over 600 genomes from under-sampled and previously unsampled New York counties and to more fully understand the breadth of the initial outbreak in Westchester County. Additional sequencing confirmed the dominance of B.1 and descendant lineages (collectively referred to as B.1.X) in New York State. Community structure, phylogenetic, and phylogeographic analyses suggested that the Westchester outbreak was associated with continued transmission of the virus throughout the state, even after travel restrictions and the on-pause measures of March, contributing to a substantial proportion of the B.1 transmission clusters as of September 30th, 2020.","Lasek-Nesselquist, E.; Singh, N.; Russell, A.; Lamson, D.; Kelly, J.; Plitnick, J.; Pfeiffer, R.

25998,Estimating the early impact of immunization against COVID-19 on deaths among elderly people in Brazil: analyses of routinely-collected data on vaccine coverage and mortality.,"BackgroundVaccination against COVID-19 in Brazil started in January 2021, with health workers and the elderly as the priority groups. We assessed whether there was an impact of vaccinations on the mortality of elderly individuals in a context of wide transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 gamma (P.1) variant.

MethodsBy May 27, 2021, 147238,414 COVID-19 deaths had been reported to the Brazilian Mortality Information System. Denominators for mortality rates were calculated by correcting population estimates for all-cause deaths reported in 2020. Proportionate mortality at ages 70-79 and 80+ years relative to deaths at all ages were calculated for deaths due to COVID-19 and to other causes, as were COVID-19 mortality rate ratios relative to individuals aged 0-69 years. Vaccine coverage data were obtained from the Ministry of Health. All results were tabulated by epidemiological weeks 1-19, 2021.

FindingsThe proportion of all COVID-19 deaths at ages 80+ years was over 25% in weeks 1-6 and declined rapidly to 12.4% in week 19, whereas proportionate COVID-19 mortality for individuals aged 70-79 years started to decline by week 15. Trends in proportionate mortality due to other causes remained stable. Mortality rates were over 13 times higher in the 80+ years age group compared to that of 0-69 year olds up to week 6, and declined to 5.0 times in week 19. Vaccination coverage (first dose) of 90% was reached by week 9 for individuals aged 80+ years and by week 13 for those aged 70-79 years. Coronavac accounted for 65.4% and AstraZeneca for 29.8% of all doses administered in weeks 1-4, compared to 36.5% and 53.3% in weeks 15-19, respectively.

InterpretationRapid scaling up of vaccination coverage among elderly Brazilians was associated with important declines in relative mortality compared to younger individuals, in a setting where the gamma variant predominates. Had mortality rates among the elderly remained proportionate to what was observed up to week 6, an estimated additional 43,802 COVID-related deaths would have been expected up to week 19.","Victora, C.

2463,Effects of Chinese strategies for controlling the diffusion and deterioration of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in China,"BackgroundIn December 2019, an outbreak of new type of coronavirus named COVID-19 occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. In a very short time, this virus spread rapidly over China, greatly threatening public health and economic development. The Chinese government acted quickly and implemented a series of strategies to prevent diffusion of this disease. We therefore sought to evaluate the effects of these Chinese strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19.

MethodsFrom the data of cumulative confirmed cases from provincial Health Commission websites of China, we performed model fitting and calculated the growth speed of cumulative confirmed patients. We further analyzed the time when this growth speed, the rate of the number of new cases, reached its maximum (Speedmax). Comparing different times to Speedmax of different areas in China, we calculated the dates at which the growth speed began to decline in different areas. Also, The number of plateaus were analyzed.

ResultsThe quartic model showed the best fit. For almost all areas in mainland China, the speed of infections reached Speedmax and began to decline within 14 days; exceptions were Hebei, Heilongjiang, Hainan, Guizhou, and Hubei. The number of plateaus was significantly correlated with the emigration index. However, the distance from other areas to Hubei and the number of plateaus had little influence on when a province or area arrived at Speedmax. Once strict intervention strategies were implemented, diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 were inhibited quickly and effectively over China.

ConclusionOur study suggests that Chinese strategies are highly effective on controlling the diffusion and deterioration of the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia. These strategies supply experience and guidelines for other countries to control the COVID-19 epidemic.","Wang, X.; Tian, W.; Lv, X.; Shi, Y.; Zhou, X.; Yu, W.; Su, D.; Tian, J.",2020-03-12,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.10.20032755,1,Jie Tian,"Department of Anesthesiology, Renji Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.20032755v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.20032755v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
23777,COVID-19 and Medical Education in Ghana: Assessing the Impact,"Medical education in Ghana has been affected in many ways by the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though the pandemic has affected both preclinical and clinical segments of medical education, the effect has been felt more at the clinical stage. Medical students on vacation who started their clinical training abroad could not return to their destination of study to complete their programme because of COVID-19 linked travel restrictions. This qualitative study examined how COVID-19 impacted on teaching and learning at a public higher education institution offering clinical medical education in Ghana for over 200 medical students. These medical students were from three different higher education institutions with varied curriculum outcomes. Thus, for them to be considered as a single group required innovativeness on the part of administrators. Open-ended interviews were held with administrators and the outcome indicated that salient aspects of the clinical training process had been impacted. These included administration of clinical education, curriculum, student learning, student assessment and code of practice. As a result of the pandemic, student learning shifted from traditional face to face interaction to online learning at the beginning. Some of the administrative challenges that ensued included the need for reduced number of students per tutor and introduction of afternoon sessions with a limited budget. The paper concludes that COVID-19 has been disruptive to traditional medical education in Ghana. However, the novel learning processes may provide opportunities to increase access to medical education using a phased system of learning. The findings from this study should have implications for policy and contribute to the discourse on blended learning in medical education in Ghana while ensuring that quality is maintained in all instances.","Asumanu, E.; Tsevi, L.",2021-03-12,Medical Education,10.1101/2021.03.11.21253306,1,Edward Asumanu,"37 Military Hospital, Neghelli Barracks, Accra, Ghana",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.11.21253306v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.11.21253306v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
11872,SARS-Cov-2 cysteine-like protease (Mpro) is immunogenic and can be detected in serum and saliva of COVID-19-seropositive individuals,"Currently, there is a need for reliable tests that allow identification of individuals that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 even if the infection was asymptomatic. To date, the vast majority of the serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies are based on serum detection of antibodies to either the viral spike glycoprotein (the major target for neutralising antibodies) or the viral nucleocapsid protein that are known to be highly immunogenic in other coronaviruses. Conceivably, exposure of antigens released from infected cells could stimulate antibody responses that might correlate with tissue damage and, hence, they may have some value as a prognostic indicator. We addressed whether other non-structural viral proteins, not incorporated into the infectious viral particle, specifically the viral cysteine-like protease, might also be potent immunogens. Using ELISA tests, coating several SARS-CoV-2 proteins produced in vitro, we describe that COVID-19 patients make high titre IgG, IgM and IgA antibody responses to the Cys-like protease from SARS-CoV-2, also known as 3CLpro or Mpro, and it can be used to identify individuals with positive serology against the coronavirus. Higher antibody titres in these assays associated with more severe disease and no cross-reactive antibodies against prior betacoronavirus were found. Remarkably, IgG antibodies specific for Mpro and other SARS-CoV-2 antigens can also be detected in saliva. In conclusion, Mpro is a potent antigen in infected patients that can be used in serological tests and its detection in saliva could be the basis for a rapid, non-invasive test for COVID-19 seropositivity.","Martinez-Fleta, P.; Alfranca, A.; Gonzalez-Alvaro, I.; Casasnovas, J.

13679,Impacts on Surgery Resident Education at a first wave COVID-19 epicenter,"BackgroundThis study aims to identify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical resident training and education at Danbury Hospital.

MethodsWe conducted an observational study at a Western Connecticut hospital heavily affected by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its effects on surgical residents, focusing on surgical education, clinical experience, and operative skills development. Objective data was available through recorded work hours, case logs, and formal didactics. In addition, we created an anonymous survey to assess resident perception of their residency experience during the pandemic.

ResultsThere are 22 surgical residents at our institution; all were included in the study. Resident weekly duty hours decreased by 23.9 hours with the majority of clinical time redirected to caring for COVID-19 patients. Independent studying increased by 1.6 hours (26.2%) while weekly didactics decreased by 2.1 hours (35.6%). The operative volume per resident decreased by 65.7% from 35.0 to 12.0 cases for the period of interest, with a disproportionately high effect on junior residents, who experienced a 76.2% decrease. Unsurprisingly, 70% of residents reported a negative effect of the pandemic on their surgical skills.

ConclusionsDuring the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical residents usual workflows changed dramatically, as much of their time was dedicated to the critical care of patients with COVID-19. However, the consequent opportunity cost was to surgery-specific training; there was a significant decrease in operative cases and time spent in surgical didactics, along with elevated concern about overall preparedness for their intended career.","Ostapenko, A.; Mcpeck, S.; Liechty, S.; Kleiner, D.",2020-08-18,Surgery,10.1101/2020.08.16.20176073,1,Alexander Ostapenko,Danbury Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20176073v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20176073v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1177/2382120520975022

24886,Drug repositioning candidates identified using in-silico quasi-quantum molecular simulation demonstrate reduced COVID-19 mortality in 1.5M patient records,"BackgroundDrug repositioning is a key component of COVID-19 pandemic response, through identification of existing drugs that can effectively disrupt COVID-19 disease processes, contributing valuable insights into disease pathways. Traditional non in silico drug repositioning approaches take substantial time and cost to discover effect and, crucially, to validate repositioned effects.

MethodsUsing a novel in-silico quasi-quantum molecular simulation platform that analyzes energies and electron densities of both target proteins and candidate interruption compounds on High Performance Computing (HPC), we identified a list of FDA-approved compounds with potential to interrupt specific SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Subsequently we used 1.5M patient records from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative to create matched cohorts to refine our in-silico hits to those candidates that show statistically significant clinical effect.

ResultsWe identified four drugs, Metformin, Triamcinolone, Amoxicillin and Hydrochlorothiazide, that were associated with reduced mortality by 27%, 26%, 26%, and 23%, respectively, in COVID-19 patients.

ConclusionsTogether, these findings provide support to our hypothesis that in-silico simulation of active compounds against SARS-CoV-2 proteins followed by statistical analysis of electronic health data results in effective therapeutics identification.","Alamgir, J.; Yajima, M.; Ergas, R.; Chen, X.; Hill, N.; Munir, N.; Saeed, M.; Gersing, K.; Haendel, M.; Chute, C.; Abid, R.",2021-04-06,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.03.22.21254110,1,Joy Alamgir,ARIScience,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.22.21254110v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.22.21254110v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
15282,Increased incidence of thrombosis in a cohort of cancer patients with COVID-19,"BackgroundIncreased rates of TE have been reported in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), even without prior predisposition to thrombosis. Cancer patients are already predisposed to a hypercoagulable state. We aimed to assess whether COVID-19 further increased the risk of thromboembolism (TE) in patients with active cancer.

MethodsData from cancer patients with documented COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed up to April 10th, 2020. Active cancer was defined as disease treated within the past year. Patients' work-up of thrombosis was done at the clinicians' discretion. All imaging studies' reports within 30 days of the COVID-19 positive test were reviewed for identification of new arterial and/or venous TE. Patients were followed for 30 days from the date of COVID-19+ test for development of TE, hospital length of stay (LOS) and mortality.

ResultsOf 90 patients, eleven (12.2%) were found to have 13 new TE within 30 days of COVID-19+ test: 8 (8.9%) arterial and 5 (5.6%) venous. Arterial TE were primarily new strokes and/or microvascular cerebral disease (7) with 1 splenic infarct. Venous TE were superficial (1) and deep (3) venous thromboses with 1 pulmonary embolism. Peak D-dimer (DD) values were numerically higher in the TE group vs those with no TE, median peak DD, 7.7 vs 3.2, p=0.25. Out of the patients with CKD/ESRD, 72.7% developed TE vs 31.6% of the those without kidney disease, p=0.02. Hospitalized patients on either prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation (AC) had fewer TE than those patients who received no anticoagulation: 9.1% vs 79.0%, p<0.0001. Only 1 patient on enoxaparin prophylaxis developed TE. Mortality was higher in the TE group with a HR of 2.6 for TE vs no TE 95% CI (1.2 - 5.6), p=0.009. Cancer type, disease stage (metastatic vs non), administration of prior chemotherapy, patient setting (inpatient, ICU, outpatient, ED visit), LOS and ventilation did not correlate with increased incidence of TE.

ConclusionPatients with COVID-19 have increased rates of TE, which remained consistent in patients with active cancer within our population. Interestingly, a high incidence of arterial events was noted. TE was associated with worse survival outcomes.","Zavras, P. D.; Mehta, V.; Goel, S.; Billett, H.

17655,"Rapid, simplified whole blood-based multiparameter assay to quantify and phenotype SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells","Rapid tests to evaluate SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses are urgently needed to decipher protective immunity and aid monitoring vaccine-induced immunity. Using a rapid whole blood assay requiring minimal amount of blood, we measured qualitatively and quantitatively SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell responses in 31 healthcare workers, using flow cytometry. 100% of COVID-19 convalescent participants displayed a detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell response. SARS-CoV-2-responding cells were also detected in 40.9% of participants with no COVID-19-associated symptoms or who tested PCR negative. Phenotypic assessment indicated that, in COVID-19 convalescent participants, SARS-CoV-2 CD4 responses displayed an early differentiated memory phenotype with limited capacity to produce IFN{gamma}. Conversely, in participants with no reported symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 CD4 responses were enriched in late differentiated cells, co-expressing IFN{gamma} and TNF and also Granzyme B. This proof of concept study presents a scalable alternative to PBMC-based assays to enumerate and phenotype SARS-CoV-2-responding T cells, thus representing a practical tool to monitor adaptive immunity in vaccine trials.

25361,Pilot program for test-based SARS-CoV-2 screening and environmental monitoring in an urban public school district,"ImportanceScalable programs for school-based SARS-CoV-2 testing and surveillance are needed to guide in-person learning practices and inform risk assessments in K-12 settings.

ObjectivesTo characterize SARS-CoV-2 infections in staff and students in an urban public school setting and evaluate test-based strategies to support ongoing risk assessment and mitigation for K-12 in-person learning.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThe pilot program engaged three schools for weekly saliva PCR testing of staff and students participating in in-person learning over a 5-week period. Wastewater, air, and surface samples were collected weekly and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA to determine surrogacy for case detection and interrogate transmission risk of in-building activities.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresSARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva and environmental samples and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Results2,885 supervised self-collected saliva samples were tested from 773 asymptomatic staff and students during November and December, 2020. 46 cases (22 students, 24 staff) were detected, representing a 5.8- and 2.5-fold increase in case detection rates among students and staff, respectively, compared to conventional reporting mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in wastewater samples from all pilot schools, as well as in air samples collected from two choir rooms. Sequencing of 21 viral genomes in saliva specimens demonstrated minimal clustering associated with one school. Geographic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 cases reported district-wide demonstrated higher community risk in zip codes proximal to the pilot schools.

Conclusions and RelevanceWeekly screening of asymptomatic staff and students by saliva PCR testing dramatically increased SARS-CoV-2 case detection in an urban public-school setting, exceeding infection rates reported at the county level. Experiences differed among schools, and virus sequencing and geographic analyses suggest a dynamic interplay of school-based and community-derived transmission risk. Environmental testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air and surface samples enabled real-time risk assessment of in-school activities and allowed for interventions in choir classes. Wastewater testing demonstrated the utility of school building-level SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Collectively, these findings provide insight into the performance and community value of test-based SARS-CoV-2 screening and surveillance strategies in the K-12 educational setting.

KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDo test-based programs reduce SARS-CoV-2 risk in K-12 schools?

FindingsWeekly school-based saliva PCR testing at three urban public schools doubled case detection among staff and students over symptom-based strategies, exceeding county-level case rates. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in school wastewater samples each week, as well as air and surface samples related to choir classrooms.

MeaningRoutine SARS-CoV-2 testing removes infected staff and students from school who are not identified through conventional case detection. With rigorous infection control and environmental monitoring, this helps mitigate risk during school operations. Furthermore, screening in K-12 schools may provide insight into disease burdens of undertested communities.","Crowe, J.; Schnaubelt, A.; Schmidt-Bonne, S.; Angell, K.; Bai, J.; Eske, T.; Nicklin, M.; Pratt, C.; White, B.; Crotts-Hannibal, B.; Staffend, N.; Herrera, V.; Cobb, J.; Conner, J.; Carstens, J.; Tempero, J.; Bouda, L.; Ray, M.; Lawler, J.; Campbell, W.

15449,The Effects of Indias COVID-19 Lockdown on Critical Non-COVID Health Care and Outcomes: Evidence from a Retrospective Cohort Analysis of Dialysis Patients,"Indias COVID-19 lockdown, one of the most severe in the world, is widely believed to have disrupted critical non-COVID health services. However, linking these disruptions to effects on health outcomes has been difficult due to the lack of reliable, up-to-date health outcomes data. We identified all dialysis patients under a statewide health insurance program in Rajasthan, India, and conducted surveys to examine the effects of the lockdown on care access, morbidity, and mortality. 63% of patients experienced a disruption to their care. Transport barriers, hospital service disruptions, and difficulty obtaining medicines were the most common causes. We compared monthly mortality in the four months after the lockdown with pre-lockdown mortality trends, as well as with mortality trends for a similar cohort in the previous year. Mortality in May 2020, after a month of exposure to the lockdown, was 1.70 percentage points or 64% (p=0.01) higher than in March 2020 and total excess mortality between April and July was estimated to be 22%. Morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality between May and July were strongly positively associated with lockdown-related disruptions to care, providing further evidence that the uptick in mortality was driven by the lockdown. Females, socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, and patients living far from the health system faced worse outcomes. The results highlight the unintended consequences of the lockdown on critical, life-saving non-COVID health services that must be taken into account in the implementation of future policy efforts to control the spread of pandemics.","Jain, R.; Dupas, P.",2021-04-06,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.09.19.20196915,2,Radhika Jain,Stanford University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.19.20196915v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.19.20196915v2.full.pdf,cc_by,"NA"
25366,Prospective predictive performance comparison between Clinical Gestalt and validated COVID-19 mortality scores.,"BackgroundMost COVID-19 mortality scores were developed in the early months of the pandemic and now available evidence-based interventions have helped reduce its lethality. It has not been evaluated if the original predictive performance of these scores holds true nor compared it against Clinical Gestalt predictions. We tested the current predictive accuracy of six COVID-19 scores and compared it with Clinical Gestalt predictions.

Methods200 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in a tertiary hospital in Mexico City between September and December 2020. Clinical Gestalt predictions of death (as a percentage) and LOW-HARM, qSOFA, MSL-COVID-19, NUTRI-CoV and NEWS2 were obtained at admission. We calculated the AUC of each score and compared it against Clinical Gestalt predictions and against their respective originally reported value.

Results106 men and 60 women aged 56+/-9 and with confirmed COVID-19 were included in the analysis. The observed AUC of all scores was significantly lower than originally reported; LOW-HARM 0.96 (0.94-0.98) vs 0.76 (0.69-0.84), qSOFA 0.74 (0.65-0.81) vs 0.61 (0.53-0.69), MSL-COVID-19 0.72 (0.69-0.75) vs 0.64 (0.55-0.73) NUTRI-CoV 0.79 (0.76-0.82) vs 0.60 (0.51-0.69), NEWS2 0.84 (0.79-0.90) vs 0.65 (0.56-0.75), Neutrophil-Lymphocyte ratio 0.74 (0.62-0.85) vs 0.65 (0.57-0.73). Clinical Gestalt predictions were non-inferior to mortality scores (AUC=0.68 (0.59-0.77)). Adjusting the LOW-HARM score with locally derived likelihood ratios did not improve its performance. However, some scores performed better than Clinical Gestalt predictions when clinicians confidence of prediction was <80%.

ConclusionNo score was significantly better than Clinical Gestalt predictions. Despite its subjective nature, Clinical Gestalt has relevant advantages for predicting COVID-19 clinical outcomes.","Soto-Mota, A.; Marfil-Garza, B.

3554,Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus in semen and testicular biopsy specimen of COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundAs of March 11, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared as a pandemic. Expending our understanding of the transmission routes of the viral infection is crucial in controlling the outbreak. It is unclear whether the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) can directly infect the testes or male genital tract and be sexually transmitted from males.

MethodsFrom January 31 to March 14, 2020, 12 patients in recovery and one patient died of COVID-19 were included in this descriptive study. The clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, chest CT scans and outcome data were recorded. To examine whether there is sexual transmission from male, we employed realtime polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect 2019-nCov in semen or testicular biopsy specimen.

FindingsThe age range of the 12 patients in recovery was 22-38 years. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia. As of March 14, 2020, ten patients discharged from the hospital while the rest 2 had developed into recovery stage. All of the 12 patients in recovery tested negative for 2019-nCoV RNA in semen samples. Another patient aged 67 died in March 10, 2020, whose tissue sample via testicular biopsy was also tested negative for viral RNA.

ConclusionNo positive RT-PCR result was found in the semen or testicular biopsy specimen. The results from this study show no evidence of sexual transmission of 2019-nCov from males.","Song, C.; Wang, Y.; Li, W.; Hu, B.; Chen, G.; Xia, P.; Wang, W.; Li, C.; Hu, Z.; Yang, X.; Yao, B.; Liu, Y.",2020-04-10,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.31.20042333,2,Xiaoyu Yang,JiangSu Province Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20042333v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20042333v2.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
9712,Covariation of Zinc Deficiency with COVID-19 Infections and Mortality in European Countries: Is Zinc Deficiency a Risk Factor for COVID-19?,"Variables responsible for the differential COVID-19 pandemic severity among countries remain undefined. Zinc, a micronutrient required for immunocompetence, is found deficient in populations. We hypothesized the differential COVID-19 severity observed among European countries could be associated with the Zn-deficiency prevalence. The COVID-19 data from different stages of pandemic, i.e., 8 April, 12 and 26 May 2020, were analyzed for covariation with the estimated Zn-deficiency. A significant, relatively stable, but negative correlation of Zn-deficiency with cases per million for the time period [r(20): -0.4930 to -0.5335, p-value: 0.02720 to 0.0154] and a steady improvement of covariation with deaths per million [r(20): -0.4056; p-value: 0.0760 on 26 May 2020] was observed. Considering, Zincs key immunomodulatory role, widespread deficiency along with the self- and prescribed intervention in different target groups, e.g. children, women, elderly, carefully planned dedicated exploratory studies to understand the basis of the observed association are advisable.","Singh, S.",2020-09-02,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.12.20105676,2,Samer Singh,Banaras Hindu University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.20105676v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.20105676v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.37398/JSR.2020.640222
3209,A modified SEIR model to predict the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain and Italy: simulating control scenarios and multi-scale epidemics,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWAfter the spread of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic out of China, evolution in the pandemic worldwide shows dramatic differences among countries. In Europe, the situation of Italy first and later Spain has generated great concern, and despite other countries show better prospects, large uncertainties yet remain on the future evolution and the efficacy of containment, mitigation or attack strategies. Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we also incorporate effects of varying proportions of containment. We fit data to quarantined populations in order to account for the uncertainties in case reporting and study the scenario projections for the 17 individual regions (CCAA). Results indicate that with data for March 23, the epidemics follows an evolution similar to the isolation of 1, 5 percent of the population and if there were no effects of intervention actions it might reach a maximum over 1.4M infected around April27. The effect on the epidemics of the ongoing partial confinement measures is yet unknown (an update of results with data until March 31st is included), but increasing the isolation around ten times more could drastically reduce the peak to over 100k cases by early April, while each day of delay in taking this hard containment scenario represents an 90 percent increase of the infected population at the peak. Dynamics at the sub aggregated levels of CCAA show epidemics at the different levels of progression with the most worrying situation in Madrid an Catalonia. Increasing alpha values up to 10 times, in addition to a drastic reduction in clinical cases, would also more than halve the number of deaths. Updates for March 31st simulations indicate a substantial reduction in burden is underway. A similar approach conducted for Italy pre- and post-interventions also begins to suggest substantial reduction in both infected and deaths has been achieved, showing the efficacy of drastic social distancing interventions.","Lopez, L.

19214,The COVID-19 herd immunity threshold is not low: A re-analysis of European data from spring of 2020,"The recent publication of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD), which calls for relaxing all public health interventions on young, healthy individuals, has brought the question of herd immunity to the forefront of COVID-19 policy discussions, and is partially based on unpublished research that suggests low herd immunity thresholds (HITs) of 10-20%. We re-evaluate these findings and correct a flawed assumption leading to COVID-19 HIT estimates of 60-80%. If policymakers were to adopt a herd immunity strategy, in which the virus is allowed to spread relatively unimpeded, we project that cumulative COVID-19 deaths would be five times higher than the initial estimates suggest. Our re-estimates of the COVID-19 HIT corroborate strong signals in the data and compelling arguments that most of the globe remains far from herd immunity, and suggest that abandoning community mitigation efforts would jeopardize the welfare of communities and integrity of healthcare systems.","Fox, S.

10252,"COVID-19 lockdown: if, when and how","BackgroundWith the lack of an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, mathematical modeling has stepped up in the COVID-19 management to guide non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) policies. Complete lockdown has been characterized as the most powerful strategy for the epidemic; anyhow, it is associated with undeniable negative consequences. Not aware that global panic could make countries adopt premature and lengthy lockdowns, previous studies only warned about the inefficacy of late quarantine sets. Therefore, we proposed ourselves to find the optimal timing and lasting for COVID-19 suppressive measures.

MethodsWe used our previously elaborated compartmental SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) model to scan different timings for lockdown set and various lockdown lengths under different reproduction number (R0) scenarios. We explored healthcare parameters focusing on ICU occupation and deaths since they condition the sanitary system and reflect the severity of the epidemic.

ResultsThe timing for the lockdown trigger varies according to the original R0 and has great impact on ICU usage and fatalities. The less the R0 the later the lockdown should be for it to be effective. The lockdown length is also something to consider. Too short lockdowns ([~]15 days) have minimal effect on healthcare parameters, but too long quarantines (>45 days) do not benefit healthcare parameters proportionally when compared to more reasonable 30 to 45-day lockdowns. We explored the outcome of the combination of a 45-day lockdown followed by strict mitigation measures sustained in time, and interestingly, it outperformed the lengthy quarantine. Additionally, we show that if strict mitigation actions were to be installed from the very beginning of the epidemic, lockdown would not benefit substantially regarding healthcare parameters.

ConclusionLockdown set timing and lasting are non-trivial variables to COVID-19 management.","Mayorga, L.; Garcia, C.; Flores, G.; Masuelli, S.; Sanchez, M. V.; Sanchez, C. G.; Mayorga, L.

25918,"The herbal combination of Sugarcane, Black Myrobalan, and mastic as a supplementary treatment for COVID-19: a randomized clinical trial","BackgroundGiven the COVID-19 pandemics, researchers are beseeched for effective treatments. Herbal medicine is also queried for potential supplementary treatments for COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the effects of Sugarcane, Black Myrobalan, and Mastic herbal medications for COVID-19 patients.

MethodsThis was a double-blinded randomized clinical trial study conducted over three months from May to July 2020 in patients admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 in Peymaniyeh Hospital in Jahrom, Iran. The intervention group received the treatment protocol approved by the Ministry of Health of Iran during the period of hospitalization and the herbal supplement obtained from the combination of black myrobalan and mastic and sugarcane, twice a day (3g of herbal supplements). All patients were compared in terms of demographic variables, vital signs, clinical and laboratory variables.

Results72 patients with COVID-19, divided into intervention (n=37) and control (n=35) groups. intervention and control groups had not any significant difference in terms of baseline characteristics. The time-to-event analysis revealed a significant difference in 4 symptoms of cough, fever, dyspnea, and myalgia (P<0.05). The Control group had a significantly lower decrease in C-reactive protein during 7 days (P<0.05). Patients in the herbal supplement group were hospitalized for 4.12 days and in the control group were hospitalized for 8.37 days (P=0.001). ICU admission and death only happened in 3 (8.6%) patients of the control group.

23918,COVID-19 with early neurological and cardiac thromboembolic phenomena--timeline of incidence and clinical features,"BackgroundAt our tertiary care public hospital, we saw COVID-19 presenting with thromboembolic phenomena, indicating a possible early thrombo-inflammatory pathology.

ObjectivesWe documented patients with cardiac and neurological thromboembolic phenomena as a primary presentation of COVID-19, and compared a subset of COVID associated strokes against COVID-19 patients without thrombotic manifestations.

MethodsWe included all COVID-Stroke and COVID-ACS (COVID-19, with ischemic arterial stroke/Acute Coronary Syndrome presenting prior to/simultaneous with/within 72 hours of systemic/respiratory COVID manifestations) admitted from April to November 2020. In the nested case control analysis, we used unpaired T-test and chi-square test to study differences between COVID-Strokes (case group) and non-thrombotic COVID controls.

Results and ConclusionsWe noted 68 strokes and 122 ACS associated with COVID-19. ACS peaked in May-June, while stroke admissions peaked later in September-October, possibly because severe strokes may have expired at home during the lockdown.

In the case-control analysis, cases (n=43; 12F:31M; mean age 51.5 years) had significantly higher D-Dimer values than controls (n=50; 9F:41M; mean age 51.6 years). Mortality was significantly higher in cases (51.2% vs. 26.0%; p = 0.018). We noted 7.5 times higher mortality in cases versus controls even among patients needing minimal oxygen support. Imaging in 37 patients showed both anterior and posterior circulation territories affected in seven, with almost half of Carotid territory strokes being large hemispherical strokes. Additionally, CT/MRI angiography in 28 strokes showed large vessel occlusions in 19 patients. Death in cases thus probably occurred before progression to intense respiratory support, due to severe central nervous system insult.

Binary logistic regression analysis showed respiratory support intensity to be the sole independent predictor of mortality among cases. Respiratory distress could have been due to COVID-19 lung infection or aspiration pneumonia resulting from obtunded sensorium. In controls, mortality was predicted by increasing age, female sex, and respiratory support intensity.","Sundar, U.; Merchant, S.; Shah, M.; Mukhopadhyay, A.; Kolte, S.; Darole, P.; Mahajan, S.; Bansal, A.; Gosavi, S.; Asole, D.; Karnik, N.; Mahajan, A.; Joshi, A.",2021-03-17,Cardiovascular Medicine,10.1101/2021.03.15.21253619,1,Amita Mukhopadhyay,"Dr Chandramma Dayananda Sagar Institute of Medical Education and Research, Kanakapura 562112, Ramanagara District, Karnataka, India",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.15.21253619v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.15.21253619v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"

20043,Common variants at 21q22.3 locus influence MX1 gene expression and susceptibility to severe COVID-19,"The COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-Cov-2, presents a heterogeneous clinical spectrum. The risk factors do not fully explain the wide spectrum of disease manifestations, so it is possible that genetic factors could account for novel insights into its pathogenesis.

In our previous study, we hypothesized that common variants on chromosome 21, near TMPRSS2 and MX1 genes, may be genetic risk factors associated to the different clinical manifestations of COVID-19. Here, we performed an in-depth genetic analysis of chromosome 21 exploiting the genome-wide association study data including 6,406 individuals hospitalized for COVID-19 and 902,088 controls with European genetic ancestry from COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. We found that five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within TMPRSS2 and near MX1 gene show suggestive associations (P[&le;]1x10-5) with severe COVID-19. All five SNPs replicated the association in two independent cohorts of Asian subjects while two and one out of the 5 SNPs replicated in African and Italian populations, respectively (P[&le;]0.05). The minor alleles of these five SNPs correlated with a reduced risk of developing severe COVID-19 and increased level of MX1 expression in blood.

Our findings provide further evidence that host genetic factors can contribute to determine the different clinical presentations of COVID-19 and that MX1, an antiviral effector of type I and III interferon pathway, may be a potential therapeutic target.","Andolfo, I.; Russo, R.; Lasorsa, A.

8008,Are we #stayinghome to Flatten the Curve?,"The recent spread of COVID-19 across the U.S. led to concerted efforts by states to flatten the curve through the adoption of stay-at-home mandates that encourage individuals to reduce travel and maintain social distance. Combining data on changes in travel activity with COVID-19 health outcomes and state policy adoption timing, we characterize nationwide changes in mobility patterns, isolate the portion attributable to statewide mandates, and link these reductions to changes in COVID-19 health outcomes. We find evidence of dramatic nationwide declines in mobility prior to adoption of any statewide mandates. Once states adopt a mandate, we estimate further mandate-induced declines between 2.1 and 7.0 percentage points relative to pre-COVID-19 baseline levels. Controlling for pre-treatment changes in mobility, we estimate mandate-induced declines of 0.13-0.17 fewer deaths and 5.6-6 fewer hospitalizations per 100,000 residents, equivalent to 23-30,000 averted deaths in adopting states for the months of March and April and death rates 42-54% lower than in the absence of policies. These estimates represent a likely lower bound on the health impacts of stay-at-home mandates, and our findings for the health impacts of early mobility reductions convey important policy implications for re-opening.","Sears, J.; Villas-Boas, J.

We determined the prevalence of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 in residual blood samples from mothers attending antenatal care services at 2 referral hospitals in Kenya. We used a validated IgG ELISA for SARS-Cov-2 spike protein and adjusted the results for assay sensitivity and specificity. In Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi, seroprevalence in August 2020 was 49.9% (95% CI 42.7-58.0). In Kilifi County Hospital seroprevalence increased from 1.3% (95% CI 0.04-4.7) in September to 11.0% (95% CI 6.2-16.7) in November 2020. There has been substantial, unobserved transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in parts of Nairobi and Kilifi Counties.","Lucinde, R.; Mugo, D.; Bottomley, C.; Aziza, R.; Gitonga, J.; Karanja, H.; Nyagwange, J.; Wanjiku, P.; Nzomo, E.; Tuju, J.; Kamurie, E.; Thuranira, K.; Agunda, S.; Nyutu, G.

9325,"Who dies from COVID-19? Post-hoc explanations of mortality prediction models using coalitional game theory, surrogate trees, and partial dependence plots","As of early June, 2020, approximately 7 million COVID-19 cases and 400,000 deaths have been reported. This paper examines four demographic and clinical factors (age, time to hospital, presence of chronic disease, and sex) and utilizes Shapley values from coalitional game theory and machine learning to evaluate their relative importance in predicting COVID-19 mortality. The analyses suggest that out of the 4 factors studied, age is the most important in predicting COVID-19 mortality, followed by time to hospital. Sex and presence of chronic disease were both found to be relatively unimportant, and the two global interpretation techniques differed in ranking them. Additionally, this paper creates partial dependence plots to determine and visualize the marginal effect of each factor on COVID-19 mortality and demonstrates how local interpretation of COVID-19 mortality prediction can be applicable in a clinical setting. Lastly, this paper derives clinically applicable decision rules about mortality probabilities through a parsimonious 3-split surrogate tree, demonstrating that high-accuracy COVID-19 mortality prediction can be achieved with simple, interpretable models.","Yang, R.",2020-06-09,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.06.07.20124933,1,Russell Yang,The Harker School,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.07.20124933v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.07.20124933v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
10040,Anti-phospholipid antibodies in COVID-19 are different from those detectable in the anti-phospholipid syndrome,"BackgroundCritically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have a profound hypercoagulable state and often develop coagulopathy which leads to organ failure and death. Because of a prolonged activated partial-thromboplastin time (aPTT), a relationship with anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL) has been proposed, but results are controversial. Functional assays for aPL (i.e., lupus anticoagulant) can be influenced by concomitant anticoagulation and/or high levels of C reactive protein. The presence of anti-cardiolipin (aCL), anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (anti-{beta}2GPI) and anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT) antibodies was not investigated systematically. Epitope specificity of anti-{beta}2GPI antibodies was not reported.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the prevalence and the clinical association of aPL in a large cohort of COVID-19 patients, and to characterize the epitope specificity of anti-{beta}2GPI antibodies.

MethodsELISA and chemiluminescence assays were used to test 122 sera of patients suffering from severe COVID-19. Of them, 16 displayed major thrombotic events.

ResultsAnti-{beta}2GPI IgG/IgA/IgM were the most frequent in 15.6/6.6/9.0% of patients, while aCL IgG/IgM were detected in 5.7/6.6% by ELISA. Comparable values were found by chemiluminescence. aPS/PT IgG/IgM were detectable in 2.5 and 9.8% by ELISA. No association between thrombosis and aPL was found. Reactivity against domain 1 and 4-5 of {beta}2GPI was limited to 3/58 (5.2%) tested sera for each domain and did not correlate with aCL/anti-{beta}2GPI nor with thrombosis.

ConclusionsaPL show a low prevalence in COVID-19 patients and are not associated with major thrombotic events. aPL in COVID-19 patients are mainly directed against {beta}2GPI but display an epitope specificity different from antibodies in antiphospholipid syndrome.","Borghi, M.

3276,Prognostic factors for COVID-19 pneumonia progression to severe symptom based on the earlier clinical features: a retrospective analysis,"Approximately 15-20% of COVID-19 patients will develop severe pneumonia, about 10 % of which will die if not properly managed. Earlier discrimination of the potential severe patients basing on routine clinical and laboratory changes and commencement of prophylactical management will not only save their lives but also mitigate the otherwise overwhelmed health care burden. In this retrospective investigation, the clinical and laboratory features were collected from 125 COVID-19 patients, who were classified into mild (93 cases) or severe (32 cases) groups according to their clinical outcomes after 3 to 7-days post-admission. The subsequent analysis with single-factor and multivariate logistic regression methods indicated that 17 factors on admission differed significantly between mild and severe groups, but that only comorbid with underlying diseases, increased respiratory rate (>24/min), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP >10mg/liter), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH >250U/liter), were independently associated with the later disease development. Finally, we evaluated their prognostic values with the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis and found that the above four factors could not confidently predict the occurrence of severe pneumonia individually, but that a combination of fast respiratory rate and elevated LDH significantly increased the predictive confidence (AUC= 0.944, sensitivity= 0.941, and specificity= 0.902). A combination consisting of 3- or 4-factors could further increase the prognostic value. Additionally, measurable serum viral RNA post-admission independently predicted the severe illness occurrence. In conclusion, a combination of general clinical characteristics and laboratory tests could provide high confident prognostic value for identifying potential severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients.

SummaryWith our successful experience of treating COVID-19 patients, we retrospectively found that routine clinical features could reliably predict severe pneumonia development, thus provide quick and affordable references for physicians to save the otherwise fatal patients with the limited medical resource.","Huang, H.; Cai, S.; Li, Y.; Li, Y.; Fan, Y.; Li, L.; Lei, C.; Tang, X.; Hu, F.; Li, F.; Deng, X.",2020-03-30,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.28.20045989,1,Feng Li,Guangzhou Eighth People\'s Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20045989v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20045989v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3389/fmed.2020.557453

7477,Preventive behavior of Vietnamese people in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,"We sought to evaluate the adherence of Vietnamese adults to COVID-19 preventive measures, and gain insight into the effects of the epidemic on the daily lives of Vietnamese people. An online questionnaire survey was organized from March 31 to April 6, 2020. The questionnaire assessed preventive behavior using multiple-answer responses to indicate the extent of adherence. In total, 2175 respondents completed the questionnaire (age range: 18-69 years). The mean adherence scores for personal and community preventive measures were 7.23 {+/-} 1.63 (range 1-9) and 9.57 {+/-} 1.12 (range 1-11), respectively. Perceived adaptation of the community to lockdown ({beta}=2.64, 95% CI 1.25-4.03), fears/worries concerning ones health ({beta}=2.87, 95% CI 0.04-5.70), residing in large cities ({beta}=19.40, 95% CI 13.78-25.03), access to official COVID-19 information sources ({beta}=16.45, 95% CI 6.82-26.08), and belonging to the healthcare sector ({beta}=22.53, 95% CI 16.00-29.07) were associated with a higher adherence score to anti-COVID instructions. The study indicates excellent preventive behavior of the Vietnamese population which explains the low number of COVID-19 infections and zero recorded mortality up to the first week of May 2020. Further monitoring is recommended to assess the sustainability of COVID-19 prevention via behavior change in the medium and long-term.","Thang, T. V.; Nguyen, N. P. T.; Hoang, T. D.; Tran, V.

For precise policy making, accurate and efficient forecasts of confirmed cases and death counts are important. In this work, we used five different univariate time series models including; Autoregressive (AR), Moving Average (MA), Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA), Nonparametric Autoregressive (NPAR) and Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) models for forecasting confirmed, death and recovered cases. These models were applied to Pakistan COVID-19 data, covering the period from 10, March to 3, July 2020. To evaluate models accuracy, computed two standard mean errors such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The findings show that the time series models are useful in predicting COVID-19 confirmed, deaths and recovered cases. Furthermore, MA model outperformed the rest of all models for confirmed and deaths counts prediction, while ARMA is second best model. The SES model seems superior to other models for prediction of recovered counts, however MA is competitive. On the basis of best selected models, we forecast form 4th July to 14th August, 2020, which will be helpful for decision making of public health and other sectors of Pakistan.","Iftikhar, H.; Iftikhar, M.",2020-09-22,Health Policy,10.1101/2020.09.20.20198150,1,Hasnain Iftikhar,"Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Pakistan",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.20.20198150v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.20.20198150v1.full.pdf,cc_by,"NA"

designA nationally representative cross-sectional survey was used. Univariate analysis was employed to compute vaccine hesitancy proportions and compare them across groups and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to compute the adjusted odds ratio.

settingBangladesh

participantsA total of 1134 participants from the general population, aged 18 years and above.

outcome measuresPrevalence and predictors of vaccine hesitancy.

results32.5% of participants showed COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Hesitancy was high among respondents who were males, over age 60, unemployed, from low-income families, from central Bangladesh including Dhaka, living in rented houses, tobacco users, politically affiliated, participants who did not believe in the vaccines effectiveness for Bangladeshis and those who did not have any physical illnesses in the last year. In the multilevel logistic regression models, respondents who were transgender (AOR= 3.62), married (AOR=1.49), tobacco users (AOR=1.33), those who did not get any physical illnesses in the last year (AOR=1.49), those with political affiliations with opposition parties (AOR= 1.48), those who believed COVID-19 vaccines will not be effective for Bangladeshis (AOR= 3.20), and those who were slightly concerned (AOR = 2.87) or not concerned at all (AOR = 7.45) about themselves or a family member getting infected with COVID-19 in the next one year were significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy (p < 0.05).

conclusionsGiven the high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, it is important to promote evidence-based communication, mass media campaigns, and policy initiatives across Bangladesh to reduce vaccine hesitancy among the Bangladeshi population.

Strengths and Limitations of the studyO_LIThis study is the first its kind to measure COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Bangladesh.

This difference remained after accounting for differences between states in several demographic and socio-economic variables.

22979,Virtual handover of patients in the pediatric intensive care unit during COVID-19 crisis,"ObjectivesA key measure to mitigate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been social distancing. Incorporating video-conferencing applications in the patient handover process between healthcare workers can enhance social distancing while maintaining handover elements. This study describes pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) physicians experience of using an online video-conferencing application for handover during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: qualitative content analysis

SettingPICU at a university hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Subjects: PICU Physicians

InterventionsDue to the pandemic, the hospitals PICU used Zoom(R) as a remote conferencing application, instead of a face-to-face handover. Following institutional review board approval, data were collected over two weeks (July 1, 2020 to July 14, 2020). Measurements: Demographic data and narrative descriptions of the perceived efficacy of remote handover were collected using open-ended questions through a created online link. The analysis process included open coding, creating categories, and abstraction.

Main ResultsAll 37 PICU physicians who participated in the handover completed the survey. The participants comprised six attendings, nine specialists, and 22 residents. They had variable previous teleconferencing experiences. Most physicians (78.4%) were comfortable conducting a remote endorsement. Most found that Situation-Background- Assessment-Recommendation handover elements were properly achieved through this remote handover process. The perceived advantages of online handover included fewer interruptions, time efficiency, and facilitation of social distancing. The perceived disadvantages were the paucity of nonverbal communication and teaching during virtual meetings.

ConclusionsVideo-conferencing applications used for online handovers could supplement traditional face-to-face intensive care unit patient endorsement during outbreaks of infectious diseases. The use of video streaming and more emphasis on teaching should be encouraged to optimize the users experience.","Temsah, M.-H.; Abouammoh, N.; Ashry, A.; Al-Eyadhy, A.; Alhaboob, A.; Alsohime, F.; Almazyad, M.; Alabdulhafid, M.; Temsah, R.; Aljamaan, F.; Jamal, A.; Halwani, R.; Alhasan, K.; Al-Tawfiq, J.

17222,The French Covid-19 contact tracing app: usage and opinions by students in the health domain,"BackgroundMany countries around the world have developed mobile phone apps capable of supporting instantaneous contact tracing to control the Covid-19 pandemic. In France, a few people have downloaded and are using the StopCovid contact tracing app. Reasons for this low uptake are unexplored. Students in the health domain are especially concerned and their usage and opinions about the app can inform improvements and diffusion of StopCovid among young people.

ObjectiveTo investigate health-related students knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices about the StopCovid app.

MethodsA field survey was conducted among 318 students at the health sciences campus of the University of Bordeaux, France, between September 25th and October 16th, 2020. Quota sampling method was used and descriptive statistics were performed.

ResultsA total of 77.3% (246/318) students had heard about the app, but only 11.3% (36/318) had downloaded it and 4.7% (15/318) were still using it at the time of the survey. Main reasons for not using the app were: belief that it was not effective given its limited diffusion (17.6%, 37/210), lack of interest (17.6%, 37/210) and distrust in data security and fear to be geo-located (15.7%, 33/210). Among those who had not heard about the app, after a brief description of its functioning and confidentiality policy, 52.7% (38/72) would use it. Participants reported that the main solution for increasing the use of the app would be a better communication (71.4%, 227/318).

ConclusionEven among health students, the contact tracing app was poorly used. Findings suggest that improved communication describing its advantages and simplicity of use, and clarifying false beliefs about the app could help improving significantly its uptake.","Montagni, I.; Roussel, N.; Thiebaut, R.; Tzourio, C.",2020-11-12,Medical Education,10.1101/2020.10.23.20218214,2,Ilaria Montagni,University of Bordeaux,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.23.20218214v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.23.20218214v2.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
19484,Is the glass half full? Extraction-free RT-LAMP to detect SARS-CoV-2 is less sensitive but highly specific compared to standard RT-PCR in 101 samples,"The current scale of public and private testing cannot be expected to meet the emerging need for higher levels of community-level and repeated screening of asymptomatic Canadians for SARS-CoV-2. Rapid point-of-care techniques are increasingly being deployed to fill the gap in screening levels required to identify undiagnosed individuals with high viral loads. However, rapid, point-of-care tests often have lower sensitivity in practice. Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) for SARS-CoV-2 has proven sensitive and specific and provides visual results in minutes. Using a commercially available kit for RT-LAMP and primer set targetting nucleocapsid (N) gene, we tested a blinded set of 101 archived nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples with known RT-PCR results. RT-LAMP reactions were incubated at 65{degrees}C for 30 minutes, using heat-inactivated nasopharyngeal swab sample in viral transport medium, diluted tenfold in water, as input. RT-LAMP agreed with all RT-PCR defined negatives (N=51), and all positives with Ct less than 20 (N=24), 65% of positives with Ct between 20-30 (N=17), and no positives with Ct greater than 30 (N=9). RT-LAMP requires fewer and different core components, so may not compete directly with the mainline testing workflow, preserving precious central laboratory resources and gold standard tests for those with the greatest need. Careful messaging must be provided when using less-sensitive tests, so that people are not falsely reassured by negative results - """"glass half empty"""" - in exchange for reliable detection of those with high levels of virus within an hour, using <$10 worth of chemicals - """"glass half full"""".","Schellenberg, J.

18033,Optimal Allocation of Limited Test Resources for the Quantification of COVID-19 Infections,"The systematic identification of infected individuals is critical for the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic. Presently, the spread of the disease is mostly quantified by the reported numbers of infections, hospitalizations, recoveries and deaths; these quantities inform epidemiology models that provide forecasts for the spread of the epidemic and guide policy making. The veracity of these forecasts depends on the discrepancy between the numbers of reported and unreported, yet infectious, individuals.

We combine Bayesian experimental design with an epidemiology model and propose a methodology for the optimal allocation of limited testing resources in space and time, which maximizes the information gain for such unreported infections. The proposed approach is applicable at the onset and spreading of the epidemic and can forewarn for a possible recurrence of the disease after relaxation of interventions. We examine its application in Switzerland; the open source software is, however, readily adaptable to countries around the world.

We find that following the proposed methodology can lead to vastly less uncertain predictions for the spread of the disease. Estimates of the effective reproduction number and of the future number of unreported infections are improved, which in turn can provide timely and systematic guidance for the effective identification of infectious individuals and for decision-making.","Chatzimanolakis, M.; Weber, P.; Arampatzis, G.; W&Aumllchli, D.; Kicic, I.; Karnakov, P.; Papadimitriou, C.; Koumoutsakos, P.",2020-11-10,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.11.09.20228320,1,Petros Koumoutsakos,Harvard University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.09.20228320v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.09.20228320v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.4414/smw.2020.20445

We tested whether pre-existing lymphocytopenia reported prior to any possible exposure to SARS-COV2 (from 2010 to 2019) was associated with fatality. Using all patients diagnosed on testing in a single regional laboratory, we identified 1137 subjects with PCR positive for SARS-COV2 and at least one available complete blood count from the decade prior to any possible exposure to the virus. Bivariate analysis indicated an association between pre-existing lymphocytopenia (defined as absolute lymphocyte count <0.9x109 /L) and fatality (18% versus 4%). Furthermore, a logistic regression model, accounting for both patient age and number of blood counts obtained, indicated the subjects with pre-existing lymphocytopenia were 1.4 times as likely to die. Because the absolute lymphocyte count is almost universally available and easily interpreted, this biomarker of the risk of fatality could be widely useful.","Burack, R.; Rock, P.; Burtoon, D.; Cai, X.",2020-10-05,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.02.20200931,1,Richard Burack,University of Rochester,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.02.20200931v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.02.20200931v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"

The aim of this review was to identify maternal and neonatal outcomes in available articles on pregnancies affected by COVID-19. The articles that had assessed outcomes of pregnancy and perinatal of women with COVID-19 between Oct 2019 and Apr 30, 2020 without language limitation were considered. All kinds of studies such as case report, case series, retrospective cohort, case control were included. We searched databases, selected relevant studies and extracted data regarding maternal and neonatal outcomes from each article. Data of 287 pregnant women with COVID-19 of 6 countries were assessed from 28 articles between December 8, 2019 and April 6, 2020. Most pregnant women reported in their third trimester, 102 (35.5%) cases were symptomatic at the time of admission. Common onset symptoms, abnormal laboratory findings, and chest computed tomography pattern were fever (51.5%), lymphocytopenia (67.9%), and multiple ground-glass opacities (78.5%) respectively. 93% of all deliveries were done through cesarean section. No maternal mortality and 3 % ICU admission were reported. Vertical transmission was not reported but its possibility was suggested in three neonates. One neonatal death, one stillbirth, and one abortion were reported. All newborns were not breastfed. This review showed fewer adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19 in comparison with previous coronavirus outbreak infection in pregnancy. Limited data are available regarding possibility of virus transmission in utero, during vaginal childbirth and breastfeeding. Effect of COVID-19 on first and second trimester and ongoing pregnancy outcomes in infected mothers is still questionable.","Azarkish, F.; Janghorban, R.",2020-05-15,Obstetrics And Gynecology,10.1101/2020.05.09.20096842,1,Roksana Janghorban,"Department of Midwifery, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Maternal-Fetal Medicine Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.09.20096842v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.09.20096842v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
9632,Estimation of global case fatality rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using meta-analyses: Comparison between calendar date and days since the outbreak of the first confirmed case.,"Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December of 2019 in China, the estimation of the pandemics case fatality rate (CFR) has been the focus and interest of many stakeholders. In this manuscript, we prove that the method of using the cumulative CFR is static and does not reflect the trend according to the daily change per unit of time. A proportion meta-analysis was carried out on CFR in every country reporting COVID-19 cases. Based on the results, we performed a meta-analysis for global COVID-19 CFR. Each analysis was performed on two different calculations of CFR: according to calendar date and according to days since the outbreak of the first confirmed case. We thus explored an innovative and original calculation of CFR concurrently based on the date of the first confirmed case as well as on a daily basis. For the first time, we showed that using meta-analyses, according to calendar date and days since the outbreak of the first confirmed case were different. We propose that CFR according to days since the outbreak of the first confirmed case might be a better predictor of the current CFR of COVID-19 and its kinetics.","Abou Ghayda, R.; Lee, K.

4264,"COVID-19 pandemics modeling with SEIR(+CAQH), social distancing, and age stratification. The effect of vertical confinement and release in Brazil.","The ongoing COVID-19 epidemics poses a particular challenge to low and middle income countries, making some of them consider the strategy of """"vertical confinement"""". In this strategy, contact is reduced only to specific groups (like age groups) that are at increased risk of severe disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aim to assess the feasibility of this scenario as an exit strategy for the current lockdown in terms of its ability to keep the number of cases under the health care system capacity. We developed a modified SEIR model, including confinement, asymptomatic transmission, quarantine and hospitalization. The population is subdivided into 9 age groups, resulting in a system of 72 coupled nonlinear differential equations. The rate of transmission is dynamic and derived from the observed delayed fatality rate; the parameters of the epidemics are derived with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We used Brazil as an example of middle income country, but the results are easily generalizable to other countries considering a similar strategy. We find that starting from 60% horizontal confinement, an exit strategy on May 1st of confinement of individuals older than 60 years old and full release of the younger population results in 400 000 hospitalizations, 50 000 ICU cases, and 120 000 deaths in the 50-60 years old age group alone. The health care system avoids collapse if the 50-60 years old are also confined, but our model assumes an idealized lockdown where the confined are perfectly insulated from contamination, so our numbers are a conservative lower bound. Our results discourage confinement by age as an exit strategy.","Lyra, W.; Do Nascimento, J. D.; Belkhiria, J.; De Almeida, L.; Chrispim, P.

19809,Exploratory comparison of Healthcare costs and benefits of the UK's Covid-19 response with four European countries,"BackgroundIn responding to covid-19, governments have tried to balance protecting health while minimising Gross Domestic Product (GDP) losses. We compare health-related net benefit (HRNB) and GDP losses associated with government responses of the UK, Ireland, Germany, Spain, and Sweden from UK healthcare payer perspective.

MethodsWe compared observed cases, hospitalisations, and deaths under """"mitigation"""" to modelled events under """"no mitigation"""" to 20th July 2020. We thus calculated healthcare costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and HRNB at {pound}20,000/QALY saved by each country. On per population (i.e. per capita) basis, we compared HRNB with forecast reductions in 2020 GDP growth (overall or compared to Sweden as minimal mitigation country) and qualitatively and quantitatively described government responses.

ResultsThe UK saved 3.17 (0.32-3.65) million QALYs, {pound}33 (8-38) billion healthcare costs, and {pound}1416 (220-1637) HRNB per capita at {pound}20,000/QALY. Per capita, this is comparable to {pound}1,455 GDP loss using Sweden as comparator and offsets 46.1 (7.1-53.2)% of total {pound}3075 GDP loss.

Germany, Spain, and Sweden had greater HRNB per capita. These also offset a greater percentage of total GDP losses per capita. Ireland fared worst on both measures. Countries with more mask wearing, testing, and population susceptibility had better outcomes. Highest stringency responses did not appear to have best outcomes.

ConclusionsOur exploratory analysis indicates the benefit of government covid-19 responses may outweigh their economic costs. The extent that HRNB offset economic losses appears to relate to population characteristics, testing levels, and mask wearing, rather than response stringency.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSOur research question was how the health-related net benefits and economic impacts of the UK response to the covid-19 epidemic first wave compared to other European countries. We searched PubMed, MedRxiv, and Arxiv for terms related to cost-effectivness, covid-19, and the UK.

Two studies compared predicted lives saved to predicted gross domestic product (GDP) losses. One found that lives saved by a lockdown would outweigh GDP losses, while another found a lockdown to cost {pound}10million per life saved. A later modelling study used quality adjusted life-years (QALYs), going beyond lives saved, and found cost per QALY was below {pound}50,000. A fourth, comparing observed to modelled deaths and hospitalisations, found the cost per QALY was at least {pound}220,000, and thus the UK response was not cost-effective. None of these were international comparisons. One international study found good health and economic outcomes to be correlated. Another found global trade reductions and voluntary behavioural changes to have greater impact on economic growth than government measures. Neither considered cost-effectiveness. However, they suggest comparison to GDP loss is naive as this is total loss and not that due to government restrictions.

Added value of this studyWe compare the UK to Ireland, Germany, Spain, and Sweden on health-related net benefits and economic impacts of government response from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. We describe countries response measures. We compared model predictions of outcomes under """"no mitigation"""" to observed outcomes under """"mitigation"""" up to July 20th 2020. We estimated healthcare costs, QALYs, and health-related net benefit (HRNB) saved. We compared HRBN to GDP losses using Sweden as a """"minimal mitigation"""" comparator and calculated the % of total GDP loss they offset.

We found the UK saved 3{middle dot}17 (0{middle dot}32-3{middle dot}65) million QALYs, {pound}33 ({pound}8-38) billion in healthcare costs, and {pound}1416 (220-1637) HRNB per capita at the NHS threshold of {pound}20,000/QALY. This is comparable to the {pound}1,455 GDP loss per capita using Sweden as comparator and offsets 46{middle dot}1% (7{middle dot}1-53{middle dot}2) of the total estimated {pound}3075 GDP loss per capita. We found that Germany, Spain, and probably Sweden had greater HRNB per capita and offset greater percentages of GDP loss per capita. Ireland fared worst on both measures. We found countries with more mask wearing, testing, and population susceptibility (e.g. older and more interpersonal contact) had better outcomes. Highest stringency responses did not appear to have best outcomes.

Implications of all the available evidenceWe add to growing evidence that the total economic impact of covid-19 exceeds the HRNB of the UKs response. However, using Sweden as comparator and comparing across countries, we argue that GDP loss is not purely due to government restrictions and that due to restrictions may be outweighed by HRNB. We evaluated the extent to which countries have offset GDP losses, and these appear to be higher in countries with more at-risk populations, higher testing, and higher mask wearing, rather than those with most stringent restrictions.","Thom, H.; Walker, J.; Vickerman, P.; Hollingworth, W.",2021-02-24,Health Economics,10.1101/2020.12.14.20248201,2,Howard Thom,University of Bristol,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.14.20248201v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.14.20248201v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,"NA"

5405,"Performing risk stratification for COVID-19 when individual level data is not available, the experience of a large healthcare organization","With the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is an urgent need for risk stratification tools to support prevention and treatment decisions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) listed several criteria that define high-risk individuals, but multivariable prediction models may allow for a more accurate and granular risk evaluation. In the early days of the pandemic, when individual level data required for training prediction models was not available, a large healthcare organization developed a prediction model for supporting its COVID-19 policy using a hybrid strategy. The model was constructed on a baseline predictor to rank patients according to their risk for severe respiratory infection or sepsis (trained using over one-million patient records) and was then post-processed to calibrate the predictions to reported COVID-19 case fatality rates. Since its deployment in mid-March, this predictor was integrated into many decision-processes in the organization that involved allocating limited resources. With the accumulation of enough COVID-19 patients, the predictor was validated for its accuracy in predicting COVID-19 mortality among all COVID-19 cases in the organization (3,176, 3.1% death rate). The predictor was found to have good discrimination, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve of 0.942. Calibration was also good, with a marked improvement compared to the calibration of the baseline model when evaluated for the COVID-19 mortality outcome. While the CDC criteria identify 41% of the population as high-risk with a resulting sensitivity of 97%, a 5% absolute risk cutoff by the model tags only 14% to be at high-risk while still achieving a sensitivity of 90%. To summarize, we found that even in the midst of a pandemic, shrouded in epidemiologic """"fog of war"""" and with no individual level data, it was possible to provide a useful predictor with good discrimination and calibration.","Barda, N.; Riesel, D.; Akriv, A.; Levi, J.; Finkel, U.; Yona, G.; Greenfeld, D.; Sheiba, S.; Somer, J.; Bachmat, E.; Rothblum, G.

2157,A simple ecological model captures the transmission pattern of the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak in China,"The rapid spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), initially reported in the city of Wuhan in China, and quickly transmitted to the entire nation and beyond, has become an international public health emergency. Estimating the final number of infection cases and the turning point (time with the fastest spreading rate) is crucial to assessing and improving the national and international control measures currently being applied. In this paper we develop a simple model based on infectious growth with a time-varying infection rate, and estimate the final number of infections and the turning point using data updated daily from 3 February 2020, when China escalated its initial public health measures, to 10 February. Our model provides an extremely good fit to the existing data and therefore a reasonable estimate of the time-varying infection rate that has largely captured the transmission pattern of this epidemic outbreak. Our estimation suggests that (i) the final number of infections in China could reach 78,000 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 88,880; (ii) the turning point of the fastest spread was on the 4th or the 5th of February; and (iii) the projected period for the end of the outbreak (i.e., when 95% of the final predicted number of infection is reached) will be the 24th of February, with an upper 95% confidence limit on the 19th of March. This suggests that the current control measures in China are excellent, and more than sufficient to contain the spread of this highly infectious novel coronavirus, and that the application of such measures could be considered internationally for the global control of this outbreak.","Zhang, F.; Zhang, J.; Cao, M.; Hui, C.",2020-02-29,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.02.27.20028928,1,Feng Zhang,Anhui University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028928v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028928v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
23813,"Prediction of severe COVID-19 cases requiring a ventilator in Tokyo, Japan","BackgroundTo avoid exhaustion of medical resources by COVID-19, policy-makers must predict care needs, specifically the proportion of severe cases likely to need ventilator care.

ObjectiveThis study was designed to use a statistical model to elucidate dynamics of severe cases in Tokyo and to discuss the timing of effective policy activation.

MethodsThe study extended from April 27 through October 18, 2020 in Japans Tokyo Metropolitan area. Medical exhaustion was defined as use of more than half of the ventilator capacity available before the COVID-19 outbreak. We regressed the number of severe cases on the newly onset patients of more than 14 days prior. As earlier research indicated, the COVID-19 severity changed at the end of May. Therefore, we added dummy variables to reflect changing severity from June and its product with newly onset patients as the explanatory variable. Then we calculated the threshold using R(t): R(t)=0.99 for the number of patients 14 days prior was used as a threshold at which strong countermeasures should be activated to keep to avoid medical exhaustion.

ResultsThe critical number signaling medical exhaustion in Tokyo was defined as 655 cases. We selected 15, 30, 60 and 90 days prior as explanatory variables for explaining the number of severe cases. A coefficient of determination larger than 0.95 was inferred as indicating good fit. The threshold was estimated as more than 4500 cases for R(t)=1.1 and monotonically decreasing by R(t) to be 600 cases for R(t)=2.5.

Discussion and ConclusionResults showed that newly onset patients reported more than 14 days prior can explain the number of severe cases very well.

4052,"Know Your Epidemic, Know Your Response: Covid-19 in the United States","We document that during the week of March 10-16, the Covid-19 pandemic fundamentally affected the perceptions of U.S. residents about the health risks and socioeconomic consequences entailed by the pandemic. During this week, it seems, """"everything changed."""" Not only did the pandemic progress rapidly across the United States, but U.S. residents started to realize that the threat was real: increasing Covid-19 caseloads heightened perceptions of infection risks and excess mortality risks, concerns about the economic implications increased substantially, and behavioral responses became widespread as the pandemic expanded rapidly in the U.S. In early to mid-March 2020, average perceptions about the coronavirus infection risks are broadly consistent with projections about the pandemic, while expectations about dying conditional on infection and expectations about Covid-19-related excess mortality during the next months are possibly too pessimistic. However, some aspects of Covid-19 perceptions are disconcerting from the perspective of implementing and sustaining an effective societal response to the pandemic. For instance, the education gradient in expected infection risks entails the possibility of having different perceptions of the reality of the pandemic between people with and without a college education, potentially resulting in two different levels of behavioral and policy-responses across individuals and regions. Unless addressed by effective health communication that reaches individuals across all social strata, some of the misperceptions about Covid-19 epidemic raise concerns about the ability of the United States to implement and sustain the widespread and harsh policies that are required to curtail the pandemic. Our analyses also reveal perceptions of becoming infected with the virus, and dying from Covid-19, were driven upwards by a rapidly increasing national caseload, and perceptions of the economic consequences and the adaptation of social distancing were affected by both national and state-level cases.","Ciancio, A.; Kämpfen, F.; Kohler, I.

25170,"Long-Term Acceptability of Hygiene, Face Covering, and Social Distancing Interventions to Prevent Exacerbations in people living with Airways Diseases","IntroductionThere has been a substantial reduction in admissions to hospital with exacerbations of airways diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic, likely because measures introduced to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 also reduced transmission of other respiratory viruses. The acceptability to patients of continuing such interventions beyond the pandemic as a measure to prevent exacerbations is not known.

MethodAn online survey of people living with respiratory disease was created by the Asthma UK - British Lung Foundation Partnership. People were asked what infection control measures they expected to continue themselves, and what they thought should be policy for the population more generally in the future, once the COVID-19 pandemic had subsided.

Results4442 people completed the survey: 3627 with asthma, 258 with bronchiectasis and 557 with COPD. Regarding personal behaviour, 79.5% would continue increased handwashing, 68.6% social distancing indoors, 46.9% would continue to wear a face covering in indoor public places (45.7% on public transport), and 59.3% would avoid friends and family who were unwell with a respiratory infection. 45.6% wanted healthcare professionals to continue wearing a mask when seeing patients. 60.7% thought that face coverings should continue to be worn by everyone in indoor public spaces during the  flu season. Women and older people were, in general, more cautious.

ConclusionPeople living with airways diseases are supportive of infection control measures to reduce the risk of exacerbations and such measures should be considered for inclusion in guidelines. Further research to refine understanding of the most effective approaches is needed.","Hurst, J. R.; Cumella, A.; Nagoda Niklewicz, C.; Philip, K. E.

22394,"Risk Perceptions, Knowledge and Behaviors of General and High-Risk Adult Populations towards COVID-19: A Systematic Scoping Review","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic represents a major crisis for governments and populations around the globe. A large number of studies have been conducted worldwide to understand peoples awareness and behavioral response towards the disease. The publics risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors are key factors that play a vital role in the transmission of infectious diseases. Our scoping review aims to map the early evidence on risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors of general and high-risk adult populations towards COVID-19.

MethodsA systematic scoping review was conducted of peer-reviewed articles in five databases (MEDLINE-Ovid, EMBASE-Ovid, PsycINFO-Ovid, Web of Science, and CINAHL-EBSCO) on studies conducted during the early stage of COVID-19 (January to June, 2020). The gray literature was also searched through Open Grey, Scopus, Wonder, Social Science Research Network, MedRxiv, and websites of major public health organizations. Twenty studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included, appraised and analyzed.

ResultsDuring the early stage of the pandemic, levels of risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors towards COVID-19 were moderate to high in both general and high-risk adult populations. The perceived severity of the disease was slightly higher than the perceived susceptibility of getting COVID-19 during the first wave of COVID-19. Adults were knowledgeable about preventive behaviors, including hand-washing, mask-wearing, social distancing, and avoidance behaviors. Nevertheless, an important knowledge gap regarding the asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 was reported in many studies. Our review identified hand-washing and avoiding crowded places as dominant preventive behaviors at the early stage of the pandemic. Staying at home, reducing social contacts, and avoiding public transport were less widespread in general populations than in high-risk adult groups. Being a female, older, and more educated was associated with better knowledge of COVID-19 and appropriate preventive behaviors.

ConclusionThis scoping review offers a first understanding of general and high-risk adults risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors towards COVID-19 during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research should be undertaken to assess psychological and behavioral responses over time. Research gaps have been identified in the relationship between ethnicity and risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors towards COVID-19.

Contribution to the field statementSince the beginning of the pandemic, a large number of primary studies have been conducted worldwide to understand peoples awareness and behavioral response towards COVID-19. Nevertheless, no review has mapped the early evidence on the perceptions, knowledge, and preventive behaviors of adult populations towards the transmission of this new disease. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scoping review that offers an understanding of the general and high-risk adults risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors (RPKB) towards COVID-19 during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. This review also identified sociodemographic factors associated with adults RPKB regarding COVID-19. As the virus does not affect individuals equally, knowing these factors can help to mitigate the negative effects of COVID-19 in certain population groups by developing targeted communication strategies that will facilitate their engagement in preventive measures. Finally, research gaps have been identified in the relationship between ethnicity and RPKB towards COVID-19. The existence of a disproportionate number of COVID-19 fatalities within Black populations should signal the possible gaps in RPKB towards COVID-19 in these communities. Additional studies on ethnic health disparities can help public health authorities to introduce targeted actions towards these communities during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Clavel, N.; Badr, J.; Gautier, L.; Lavoie-Tremblay, M.",2021-02-15,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.02.09.21250257,1,Nathalie Clavel,McGill University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.09.21250257v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.09.21250257v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
21818,High variability in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within households and implications for control,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a high risk of transmission in close-contact indoor settings, which may include households. Prior studies have found a wide range of household secondary attack rates and may contain biases due to simplifying assumptions about transmission variability and test accuracy.

MethodsWe compiled serological SARS-CoV-2 antibody test data and prior SARS-CoV-2 test reporting from members of 9,224 Utah households. We paired these data with a probabilistic model of household importation and transmission. We calculated a maximum likelihood estimate of the importation probability, mean and variability of household transmission probability, and sensitivity and specificity of test data. Given our household transmission estimates, we estimated the threshold of non-household transmission required for epidemic growth in the population.

ResultsWe estimated that individuals in our study households had a 0.41% (95% CI 0.32% - 0.51%) chance of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection outside their household. Our household secondary attack rate estimate was 36% (27% - 48%), substantially higher than the crude estimate of 16% unadjusted for imperfect serological test specificity and other factors. We found evidence for high variability in individual transmissibility, with higher probability of no transmissions or many transmissions compared to standard models. With household transmission at our estimates, the average number of non-household transmissions per case must be kept below 0.41 (0.33 - 0.52) to avoid continued growth of the pandemic in Utah.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest that crude estimates of household secondary attack rate based on serology data without accounting for false positive tests may underestimate the true average transmissibility, even when test specificity is high. Our finding of potential high variability (overdispersion) in transmissibility of infected individuals is consistent with characterizing SARS-CoV-2 transmission being largely driven by superspreading from a minority of infected individuals. Mitigation efforts targeting large households and other locations where many people congregate indoors might curb continued spread of the virus.","Toth, D. J. A.; Beams, A. B.; Keegan, L.

18203,"Natural history, trajectory, and management of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients in the United Kingdom.","BackgroundTo date the description of mechanically ventilated patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has focussed on admission characteristics with no consideration of the dynamic course of the disease. Here, we present a data-driven analysis of granular, daily data from a representative proportion of patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) within the United Kingdom (UK) to evaluate the complete natural history of COVID-19.

MethodsWe included adult patients undergoing IMV within 48 hours of ICU admission with complete clinical data until intensive care unit (ICU) death or discharge. We examined factors and trajectories that determined disease progression and responsiveness to interventions used in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Our data visualisation tool is available as a web-based widget (https://www.CovidUK.ICU).

FindingsData for 633 adults with COVID-19 who were mechanically ventilated between 01 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 were analysed. Mortality, intensity of mechanical ventilation and severity of organ injury increased with severity of hypoxaemia. Median PaO2/FiO2 in non-survivors on the day of death was 12.3(8.9-18.4) kPa suggesting severe refractory hypoxaemia as a major contributor to mortality. Non-resolution of hypoxaemia over the first week of IMV was associated with higher ICU mortality (60.4% versus 17.6%; P<0.001). The reported ideal body weight overestimated our calculated ideal body weight derived from reported height, with three-quarters of all reported tidal volume values were above 6mL/kg of ideal body weight. Overall, 76% of patients with moderate hypoxaemia and 46% with severe did not undergo prone position at any stage of admission. Furthermore, only 45% showed a persistent oxygenation response on prone position. Non-responders to prone position show higher lactate, D-Dimers, troponin, cardiovascular component of the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and higher ICU mortality (69.5% versus 31.1%; P<0.001). There was no difference in number of prone sessions between survivors and non-survivors, however, patients who died without receiving prone position had a greater number of missed opportunities for prone intervention (7(3-15.5) versus 2(0-6); P<0.001).

InterpretationA sizeable proportion of patients with progressive worsening of hypoxaemia had no application of and were refractory to evidence based ARDS strategies and showed a higher mortality. Strategies for early recognition and management of COVID-19 patients refractory to conventional management strategies will be critical to improving future outcomes.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSBeyond the regular literature expertise of our consortium, we enhanced our literature review - due to the fast-evolving Covid-19 publication situation-by searching PubMed for articles published in English or with English language abstracts on October 26, 2020 (and before), with the terms """"mechanical ventilation"""", """"prone position"""", """"AND (""""coronavirus"""" OR """"COVID-19""""). Studies including patients not receiving ventilation were excluded, as were those reporting on paediatric and single-centre populations. Note, that neither of those studies analysed the data with respect to the temporal evolution of patients and at our level of granularity. Only four multicentre studies reported detailed ventilator settings and outcomes in ventilated patients with COVID-19. All studies showed only ventilator settings with restricted time points either on admission or the first 4 days of admission. None enabled granular visualisation and analysis of longitudinal ICU trajectory and management.

Added value of this studyThis study provides a comprehensive analysis and visualisation of routine clinical measurements tracking the whole ICU time course of patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation for COVID-19. Mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 have a different natural history and trajectory from descriptions of non-COVID ARDS patients, not predictable from admission physiology. Refractory hypoxaemia is an attributable factor associated with poor outcomes in Covid-19 and hence, understanding of use and utility of evidence-based ARDS interventions is clinically crucial. Opportunities to apply prone positioning appropriately are frequently missed, application of high levels of PEEP, and higher tidal volume delivery than planned is common. Lack of responsiveness to advanced ARDS management is associated with hypercoagulation and cardiovascular instability. These data may help homogenise future clinical management protocols and suggest change-of-practice trials.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis study shows that disease progression in Covid-19 during the first surge occurred more frequently and for longer than other forms of respiratory failure from pre-Covid19 studies. Furthermore, variations in clinical practise occur across sites which may benefit from standardisation of evidence-based practise. Patients that do not resolve hypoxaemia over the first week have a significantly higher mortality, and, crucially, that a significant proportion are refractory to prone interventions and show variability in responses to PEEP changes. Opportunities to implement prone position were missed in many patients and this was compounded with its reduced effect on oxygenation with delayed application. This lack of responsiveness is related to indices of inflammation, thrombosis, and cardiac dysfunction suggesting that pulmonary thrombosis could influence prone responsiveness and should be pro-actively investigated in the setting of refractory Covid-19 ARDS. Prediction of failure to resolve or respond to ARDS interventions could further focus research on this group with worse outcome.","Patel, B. V.; Haar, S.; Handslip, R.; Lee, T.

12888,Comparing the impact on COVID-19 mortality of self-imposed behavior change and of government regulations across 13 countries,"BackgroundCountries have adopted different approaches, at different times, to reduce the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Cross-country comparison could indicate the relative efficacy of these approaches. We assess various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) over time, comparing the effects of self-imposed (i.e. voluntary) behavior change and of changes enforced via official regulations, by statistically examining their impacts on subsequent death rates in 13 European countries.

Methods and findingsWe examine two types of NPI: the introduction of government-enforced closure policies over time; and self-imposed alteration of individual behaviors in response to awareness of the epidemic, in the period prior to regulations. Our proxy for the latter is Google mobility data, which captures voluntary behavior change when disease salience is sufficiently high. The primary outcome variable is the rate of change in COVID-19 fatalities per day, 16-20 days after interventions take place. Linear multivariate regression analysis is used to evaluate impacts. Voluntarily reduced mobility, occurring prior to government policies, decreases the percent change in deaths per day by 9.2 percentage points (95% CI 4.5-14.0 pp). Government closure policies decrease the percent change in deaths per day by 14.0 percentage points (95% CI 10.8-17.2 pp). Disaggregating government policies, the most beneficial are intercity travel restrictions, cancelling public events, and closing non-essential workplaces. Other sub-components, such as closing schools and imposing stay-at-home rules, show smaller and statistically insignificant impacts.

ConclusionsThis study shows that NPIs have substantially reduced fatalities arising from COVID-19. Importantly, the effect of voluntary behavior change is of the same order of magnitude as government-mandated regulations. These findings, including the substantial variation across dimensions of closure, have implications for the phased withdrawal of government policies as the epidemic recedes, and for the possible reimposition of regulations if a second wave occurs, especially given the substantial economic and human welfare consequences of maintaining lockdowns.","Jamison, J.; Bundy, D.; Jamison, D.; Spitz, J.; Verguet, S.",2020-08-04,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.08.02.20166793,1,Julian Jamison,University of Exeter,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.02.20166793v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.02.20166793v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
9130,Multicenter point-prevalence evaluation of the utilization and safety of drug therapies for COVID-19,"BackgroundThere are currently no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of COVID-19. At the onset of the pandemic, off-label medication use was supported by limited or no clinical data. We sought to characterize experimental COVID-19 therapies and identify safety signals during this period.

MethodsWe conducted a non-interventional, multicenter, point prevalence study of patients hospitalized with suspected/confirmed COVID-19. Clinical and treatment characteristics within a 24-hour window were evaluated in a random sample of up to 30 patients per site. The primary objective was to describe COVID-19 targeted therapies. The secondary objective was to describe adverse drug reactions (ADRs).

ResultsA total of 352 patients from 15 US hospitals were included. Most patients were treated at academic medical centers (53.4%) or community hospitals (42.6%). Sixty-seven patients (19%) were receiving drug therapy in addition to supportive care. Drug therapies included hydroxychloroquine (69%), remdesivir (10%), and interleukin-6 inhibitors (9%). Five patients (7.5%) were receiving combination therapy. Patients with a history of asthma (14.9% vs. 7%, p = 0.037) and those enrolled in clinical trials (26.9% vs.

3.2%, p< 0.001) were more likely to receive therapy. Among those receiving COVID-19 therapy, eight patients (12%) experienced an ADR, and ADRs were more commonly recognized in patients enrolled in clinical trials (62.5% vs 22%, OR = 5.9, p = 0.028).

ConclusionsWhile we observed high rates of supportive care for patients with COVID-19, we also found that ADRs were common among patients receiving drug therapy including in clinical trials.

Current risk prediction for CV complications in COVID-19 is limited and existing approaches fail to account for the dynamic course of the disease. Here, we develop and validate the COVID-HEART predictor, a novel continuously-updating risk prediction technology to forecast CV complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The risk predictor is trained and tested with retrospective registry data from 2178 patients to predict two outcomes: cardiac arrest and imaging-confirmed thromboembolic events. In repeating model validation many times, we show that it predicts cardiac arrest with an average median early warning time of 18 hours (IQR: 13-20 hours) and an AUROC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.91-0.92), and thromboembolic events with a median early warning time of 72 hours (IQR: 12-204 hours) and an AUROC of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.67-0.73). The COVID-HEART predictor is anticipated to provide tangible clinical decision support in triaging patients and optimizing resource utilization, with its clinical utility potentially extending well beyond COVID-19.","Shade, J.

25607,Preexisting diabetes and COVID-associated hyperglycaemia in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSObjectiveC_ST_ABSThe aim of the current study was to compare clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and major outcomes of patients hospitalized for COVID 19 pneumonia with new-onset or preexisting diabetes.

DesignA cohort of 176 adult patients with a diagnosis of pre-existing (n=112) or new-onset diabetes (n=55) and confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia was studied. Clinical outcomes and laboratory findings were analysed according to the presence of preexisting or new-onset diabetes. The time to viral clearance and the persistence of hyperglycemia were assessed during the follow-up after hospital discharge.

ResultsPatients with new-onset diabetes had lower BMI, significantly less comorbidities and higher levels of inflammatory markers and indicators of multi-organ injury than those with preexisting diabetes. No differences between preexisting and new onset diabetes were evident for symptoms at admission, humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 or autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase or interferon alpha-4. New-onset diabetes was independently associated with the risk of adverse clinical outcome defined as ICU admission or death (HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.34-3.31; p=0.001), even after adjustment for age, sex and other selected variables associated with COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, we documented a negative association (HR 0.661, 95% CI 0.43-1.02; p=0.063) between new-onset diabetes and the time to swab negativization. During follow-up we observed that in 30% of the patients with new-onset diabetes hyperglycemia reversed when the viral infection resolved.

ConclusionsThe recognition of new-onset diabetes as a specific clinical entity associated with COVID-19 pneumonia is relevant for early and appropriate patient management and close monitoring for the progression of disease severity.","Laurenzi, A.; Caretto, A.; Molinari, C.; Bazzigaluppi, E.; Brigatti, C.; Marzinotto, I.; Mercalli, A.; Melzi, R.; Nano, R.; Tresoldi, C.; Landoni, G.; Ciceri, F.; Lampasona, V.; Scavini, M.; Piemonti, L.",2021-05-24,Endocrinology,10.1101/2021.04.17.21255548,2,Lorenzo Piemonti,IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.17.21255548v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.17.21255548v2.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
12925,Evaluation of Serological SARS-CoV-2 Lateral Flow Assays for Rapid Point of Care Testing,"BackgroundRapid point-of-care tests (POCTs) for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies vary in performance. A critical need exists to perform head-to-head comparison of these assays.

MethodsPerformance of fifteen different lateral flow POCTs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was performed on a well characterized set of 100 samples. Of these, 40 samples from known SARS-CoV-2-infected, convalescent individuals (average of 45 days post symptom onset) were used to assess sensitivity. Sixty samples from the pre-pandemic era (negative control), that were known to have been infected with other respiratory viruses (rhinoviruses A, B, C and/or coronavirus 229E, HKU1, NL63 OC43) were used to assess specificity. The timing of seroconversion was assessed on five POCTs on a panel of 272 longitudinal samples from 47 patients of known time since symptom onset.

ResultsFor the assays that were evaluated, the sensitivity and specificity for any reactive band ranged from 55%-97% and 78%-100%, respectively. When assessing the performance of the IgM and the IgG bands alone, sensitivity and specificity ranged from 0%-88% and 80%-100% for IgM and 25%-95% and 90%-100% for IgG. Longitudinal testing revealed that median time post symptom onset to a positive result was 7 days (IQR 5.4, 9.8) for IgM and 8.2 days (IQR 6.3 to 11.3).

ConclusionThe testing performance varied widely among POCTs with most variation related to the sensitivity of the assays. The IgM band was most likely to misclassify pre-pandemic samples.

We observed SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity in the patients. Both were detected in newly discharged patients, suggesting both participate in immune-mediated protection to viral infection. However, follow-up patients (2 weeks post discharge) exhibited high titers of IgG antibodies, but with low levels of virus-specific T cells, suggesting that they may enter a quiescent state. Our work has thus provided a basis for further analysis of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19, especially in the severe cases. It has also implications in designing an effective vaccine to protect and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Dong, C.; Ni, L.; Ye, F.; Chen, M.-L.; Feng, Y.; Deng, Y.-Q.; Zhao, H.; Wei, P.; Ge, J.; Li, X.; Sun, L.; Wang, P.; Liang, P.; Guo, H.; Wang, X.; Qin, C.-F.; Chen, F.",2020-03-20,Allergy And Immunology,10.1101/2020.03.17.20036640,1,Chen Dong,"Institute for immunology, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20036640v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20036640v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
24590,On the association between SARS-COV-2 variants and COVID-19 mortality during the second wave of the pandemic in Europe,"BACKGROUNDPreliminary clinical evidence suggests an increased COVID-19 mortality associated with the variant of concern 20I/501Y.V1. The evidence outside the UK and a real-world comparison of variants spread and mortality is sparse. This study aims at investigating the association between COVID-19 mortality and SARS-COV-2 variants spread during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe.

METHODSFor 38 European countries, publicly available data were collected on numbers of COVID-19 deaths, SARS-COV-2 variants spread through time using Nextstrain classification and countries demographic and health characteristics. The cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths and the height of COVID-19 daily deaths peak during the second wave of the pandemic were considered as outcomes. Pearson correlations and multivariate generalized linear models with selection algorithms were used.

FINDINGSThe average proportion of 20I/501Y.V1 variant (B.1.1.7) was found to be a significant predictor of cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths within two months before the deaths peak and between 1 January - 25 February 2021, as well as of the deaths peak height when calculating the proportion during the second wave and the pre-peak period. The average proportion of 20A.EU2 variant (S:477N) was a significant predictor of cumulative COVID-19 deaths in the pre-peak period.

INTERPRETATIONOur findings suggest that the spread of a new variant of concern 20I/501Y.V1 had a significant impact on the mortality during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and that proportions of 20A.EU2 and 20I/501Y.V1 variants were associated with increased mortality in the initial phase of that wave.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSEmerging evidence suggests that the new variant of concern 20I/501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7) may be associated with an increased risk of death. The 20A.EU2 variant (S:447N), observed firstly in July 2020 in western Europe, was found to be capable of increasing SARS-COV-2 infectivity. The evidence outside the UK is still sparse, same as a real-world comparison of distinct variants spread and mortality through time.

Added value of this studyIn this study we investigated whether the change of the proportion of any SARS-COV-2 variant, including 20I/501Y.V1 and 11 other variants identified by Nextstrain up to 25 February 2021, has an association with COVID-19 cumulative mortality or with the height of the second wave COVID-19 mortality peak.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur findings shed light on the causes of the increased COVID-19 mortality during the second wave of the pandemic in Europe. It shows the need for early containment strategies when the variant 20I/501Y.V1 emerges. These findings also support the need for systematic SARS-CoV-2 regular genome sequencing to control the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jablonska, K.; Aballea, S.; Auquier, P.; Toumi, M.",2021-03-28,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.03.25.21254289,1,Katarzyna Jablonska,Creativ-Ceutical,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.25.21254289v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.25.21254289v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
13499,The operational impact of deploying SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in countries of the WHO African Region,"BackgroundAfter SARS-CoV-2 vaccines become available, they will be deployed to many countries with limited immunization systems.

MethodsWe conducted a cold chain capacity assessment of a simulated country in the WHO African Region. We combined region-specific data regarding immunization, population, healthcare workforce, and cold storage capacity (upper and lower range and quartile values for national and subnational levels). We used seasonal influenza vaccines as proxies for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We evaluated the increase in vaccine doses to be administered, doses administered per vaccinator, and cold storage volumes for SARS-CoV-2 campaigns targeting risk groups compared to routine immunization baselines.

FindingsCompared to routine immunization, a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign would increase monthly doses administered when targeting risk groups: [&ge;]65 years (29.9%), chronic diseases patients (101.5%), and healthcare workers (1.2%). SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would increase doses administered per vaccinator for risk groups: [&ge;]65 years (32.5%), chronic diseases patients (110.4%), or healthcare workers (1.4%). Routine vaccine volumes already exceed national level storage capacity for at least 75% of African Region countries, but subnational levels would have sufficient storage capacity for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in all but the lower 25% of African Region countries.

InterpretationSARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would substantially increase doses per vaccinator and cold chain capacity requirements over routine immunization baselines. Pandemic vaccination campaigns would add volume to national level stores already at their limits, but substantial capacity exists at subnational levels for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Immediate attention to strengthening delivery systems is essential to support pandemic vaccine responses in the African Region.

1839,Risk map of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China: proportionate control is needed,"BackgroundChina is running a national level antivirus campaign against the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Strict control measures are being enforced in either the populated areas and remote regions. While the virus is closed to be under control, tremendous economic loss has been caused.

Methods and findingsWe assessed the pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV for all cities/regions in China using the random forest algorithm, taking into account the effect of five factors: the accumulative and increased numbers of confirmed cases, total population, population density, and GDP. We defined four levels of the risk, corresponding to the four response levels to public health emergencies in China. The classification system has good consistency among cities in China, as the error rate of the confusion matrix is 1.58%.

ConclusionsThe pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV is dramatically different among the 442 cities/regions. We recommend to adopt proportionate control policy according to the risk level to reduce unnecessary economic loss.","Li, X.; Zhao, X.; Lou, Y.; Sun, Y.",2020-02-18,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.02.16.20023838,1,Xinhai Li,"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023838v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023838v1.full.pdf,cc_by,"NA"

OBJECTIVETo develop and validate a predication model, presented as nomogram and scale, to distinguish infectious acute abdomen patients suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

DESIGNDiagnostic model based on retrospective case series.

SETTINGTwo hospitals in Wuhan and Beijing, China.

PTRTICIPANTS584 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 from 2 Jan 2020 to15 Feb 2020 and 238 infectious acute abdomen patients receiving emergency operation from 28 Feb 2019 to 3 Apr 2020.

METHODSLASSO regression and multivariable logistic regression analysis were conducted to develop the prediction model in training cohort. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by calibration curves, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curves in training and validation cohort. A simplified screening scale and managing algorithm was generated according to the nomogram.

RESULTSSix potential COVID-19 prediction variables were selected and the variable abdominal pain was excluded for overmuch weight. The five potential predictors, including fever, chest computed tomography (CT), leukocytes (white blood cells, WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT), were all independent predictors in multivariable logistic regression analysis (p [&le;]0.001) and the nomogram, named COVID-19 Infectious Acute Abdomen Distinguishment (CIAAD) nomogram, was generated. The CIAAD nomogram showed good discrimination and calibration (C-index of 0.981 (95% CI, 0.963 to 0.999) and AUC of 0.970 (95% CI, 0.961 to 0.982)), which was validated in the validation cohort (C-index of 0.966 (95% CI, 0.960 to 0.972) and AUC of 0.966 (95% CI, 0.957 to 0.975)). Decision curve analysis revealed that the CIAAD nomogram was clinically useful. The nomogram was further simplified into the CIAAD scale.

CONCLUSIONSWe established an easy and effective screening model and scale for surgeons in emergency department to distinguish COVID-19 patients from infectious acute abdomen patients. The algorithm based on CIAAD scale will help surgeons manage infectious acute abdomen patients suspected COVID-19 more efficiently.","Zhao, B.; Wei, Y.; Sun, W.; Qin, C.; Zhou, X.; Wang, Z.; Li, T.; Cao, H.; Wang, W.; Wang, Y.",2020-04-23,Surgery,10.1101/2020.04.18.20071019,1,Weibin Wang,"Department of General Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.18.20071019v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.18.20071019v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3389/fmed.2021.601941
24819,Diagnostic Utility of Antigen Detection Rapid Diagnostic Tests for Covid- 19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"BackgroundEarly detection of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection to improve disease management, becomes the greatest challenge. Despite high sensitivity of RT-PCR, not only it was reported that 20-67% of infected patients have false negative results. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are widely used as a point-of-care test for SARS-CoV-2 detection in both pharyngeal and blood specimens. To be less time-consuming, not seem so costly, and requiring no special training make it more favorable, but the low sensitivity is the main limitation. Several reports indicated rapid test of blood and pharyngeal samples has the same sensitivity as the RT-PCR, but some reports have lower sensitivity especial in asymptomatic patients.

MethodsIn the present survey, we investigate the eligible studies for sensitivity and specificity of rapid tests and explore the factors that influence the result to help better diagnose COVID-19 infection. 20 studies met the inclusion criteria, which impose 33 different tests.

ResultsOur findings showed, type of sample, type of assay, time of sampling, and load of virus influence on sensitivity of RDTs.

ConclusionThis research extends our knowledge of how to improve the sensitivity of RDTs to better diagnose of infected patients to address the controlling COVID-19 pandemic.","Ebrahimi, M.; Nazari Harmooshi, N.; Rahim, F.",2021-04-05,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.04.02.21254714,1,Fakher Rahim,Ahvaz jundishapur university of medical sciences,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.02.21254714v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.02.21254714v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
20971,Bacterial superinfection pneumonia in SARS-CoV-2 respiratory failure,"BackgroundSevere community-acquired pneumonia secondary to SARS-CoV-2 is a leading cause of death. Current guidelines recommend patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia receive empirical antibiotic therapy for suspected bacterial superinfection, but little evidence supports these recommendations.

MethodsWe obtained bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation. We analyzed BAL samples with multiplex PCR and quantitative culture to determine the prevalence of superinfecting pathogens at the time of intubation and identify episodes of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) over the course of mechanical ventilation. We compared antibiotic use with guideline-recommended care.

ResultsThe 179 ventilated patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia discharged from our hospital by June 30, 2020 were analyzed. 162 (90.5%) patients had at least one BAL procedure; 133 (74.3%) within 48 hours after intubation and 112 (62.6%) had at least one subsequent BAL during their hospitalization. A superinfecting pathogen was identified within 48 hours of intubation in 28/133 (21%) patients, most commonly methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus species (21/28, 75%). BAL-based treatment reduced antibiotic use compared with guideline-recommended care. 72 patients (44.4%) developed at least one VAP episode. Only 15/72 (20.8%) of initial VAPs were attributable to multidrug-resistant pathogens. The incidence rate of VAP was 45.2/1000 ventilator days.

ConclusionsWith use of sensitive diagnostic tools, bacterial superinfection at the time of intubation is infrequent in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Treatment based on current guidelines would result in substantial antibiotic overuse. The incidence rate of VAP in ventilated patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia are higher than historically reported.","Pickens, C. O.; Gao, C. A.; Cuttica, M. J.; Smith, S.

24134,Weekly SARS-CoV-2 screening of asymptomatic students and staff to guide and evaluate strategies for safer in-person learning,"BackgroundData suggest that COVID-19 transmission in K-12 schools is uncommon, but few studies have confirmed this using widespread screening of asymptomatic individuals.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the incidence of asymptomatic COVID-19, document the frequency of in-school transmission, and confirm feasibility of widespread asymptomatic screening in schools.

DesignProspective observational study

SettingSingle mid-sized suburban school district including 10 schools and a central office.

ParticipantsDistrict staff and students

InterventionsAsymptomatic screening PCR for SARS-CoV-2

MeasurementsConcurrent with a hybrid model and layered mitigation, weekly pooled testing of staff and secondary students was offered using saliva samples collected at home. Identification of >1 case in a school prompted investigation for possible in-school transmission. Staff and families were surveyed about satisfaction with the screening program.

ResultsFrom weeks 1-18, rates of incident COVID-19 in the surrounding community rose steadily. Weekly staff and student screening identified 0-7 asymptomatic cases/week. In week 7, 5 cases were identified among staff who shared an office setting. Enhancements to mitigation strategies were undertaken. The proportion of survey respondents self-reporting comfort with in-person learning before versus after implementation of screening increased.

LimitationsBecause screening testing was not mandatory, the results from the participating population might not represent the entire school community.

ConclusionsIn this school district with layered mitigation measures, in-school transmission was rare. The program identified a cluster with in-school staff-to-staff transmission and spurred enhancement of safety strategies. A weekly COVID-19 screening program can provide critical data to inform mitigation efforts, and provides school-specific, current data to inform decisions about in-person learning models. Screening provided reassurance and identified asymptomatic cases.

In this paper, we present a data-informed approach for building stochastic compartmental models that is grounded in the Markovian processes underlying these models. Our initial data analyses reveal that the SIRD model - susceptiple (S), infected (I), recovered (R), and death (D) - is not consistent with the data. In particular, the transition times expressed in the dataset do not obey exponential distributions, implying that there exist unmodeled (hidden) states. We make use of the available epidemiological data to inform the location of these hidden states, allowing us to develop an augmented compartmental model which includes states for hospitalization (H) and end of infectious viral shedding (V). Using the proposed model, we characterize delay distributions analytically and match model parameters to empirical quantities in the data to obtain a good model fit.

23281,Reopening Universities without Testing During COVID-19: Evaluating a Possible Alternative Strategy in Low Risk Countries,"The safety of students worldwide remains a key issue during COVID-19. The reopening of universities in high risk countries during Fall 2020 resulted in numerous outbreaks. While regular screening and testing on campus can prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, they are extremely challenging to implement due to various reasons such as cost and logistics. However, for low risk countries with minimal to no community spread, our study suggests that universities can fully reopen without testing, if students self-quarantine for 14 days on arrival and adopt proper nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). This alternative strategy might save institutions millions of dollars. We adopt agent-based simulation to model virus transmission on campus and test the effectiveness of several NPIs when school reopens. Assuming one initially infected student, results indicate that transmission between roommates causes the most infections with visitors, ground floors, and elevators, being the next main contributors. Limiting density and/or population are not impactful at flattening the curve. However, adopting masks, minimizing movement, and increasing the frequency of cleaning can effectively minimize infection and prevent outbreak, allowing for classes and activities to resume as normal.","Xi, J.

Depression, anxiety and worsening of sleep quality have been reported in several recent articles that surveyed populations all over the globe. Our work meant to access, through a cross-sectional study, these disorders in the Brazilian population, through the application of an online questionnaire conducted on the second trimester of 2020.

Materials and MethodsWe applied an online questionnaire, filled with questions regarding social, economic, financial, educational and health status, as well as questions from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), and from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).

ResultsWe collected 2,695 valid answers, from April 24th to May 31st, 2020. Age ranged from 18 to 79 years, mean of 31.3. Women were 76.3%, men 23.7%. Symptoms of Anxiety were found in 56.5%, of depression in 46.1%, and of bad sleep in 49.2%. Some groups were more prone than others to one or more of those conditions, such as: younger people, women, mestizos, Northeasterners, people with lesser years of education, of lower income or whose income dropped significantly during the pandemic, caregivers, students, sedentary or people practicing less physical activity, people who followed more hours of news of COVID-19 and those less engaged in social and instrumental activities.

Conclusionanxiety, depression and bad sleep quality were significantly high in our survey. Mental and sleep health is heterogeneously affected among individuals, depending on social, economic, financial, educational and health status.

O_TEXTBOXHIGHLIGHTS

- An online survey (DEGAS-CoV) was conducted between April 30th and May 31st, 2020, with people living in Brazil, aged 18 or more. The study obtained 2,695 valid answers.
- Rates of possible anxiety, possible depression and bad sleep quality were 56.5%, 46.1% and 49.2%, respectively. Rates are similar to another Brazilian survey, with 45,161 participants, conducted in a similar time window.
- Were more prone to mental and/or sleep conditions: younger participants, women, mestizos, unemployed, students, people with less years of education, people with lower income or with considerable drops of income during the virus outbreak, caregivers, people who followed more news of COVID-19, people less engaged in social and instrumental activities, smokers, sedentary or those who practiced less physical activity, and people who had symptoms suspected (confirmed or not) of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
- Alcohol drinkers were slightly less likely to be possibly depressed. That finding needs more clarification and may be due to confounders.

5173,Current Understanding of COVID-19 Clinical Course and Investigational Treatments,"ImportanceCurrently, there is no unified framework linking disease progression to established viral levels, clinical tests, inflammatory markers, and investigational treatment options.

ObjectiveIt may take many weeks or months to establish a standard treatment approach. Given the growing morbidity and mortality with respect to COVID-19, we present a treatment approach based on a thorough review of scholarly articles and clinical reports. Our focus is on staged progression, clinical algorithms, and individualized treatment.

Evidence ReviewWe followed the protocol for a quality review article proposed by Heyn et. al.1 A literature search was conducted to find all relevant studies related to COVID-19. The search was conducted between April 1, 2020 and April 13, 2020 using the following electronic databases: PubMed (1809 to present), Google Scholar (1900 to present), MEDLINE (1946 to present), CINAHL (1937 to present), and Embase (1980 to present). Keywords used included COVID-19, 2019-nCov, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, with terms such as efficacy, seroconversion, microbiology, pathophysiology, viral levels, inflammation, survivability, and treatment and pharmacology. No language restriction was placed on the search. Reference lists were manually scanned for additional studies.

FindingsOf the articles found in the literature search, 70 were selected for inclusion in this study (67 cited in the body of the manuscript and 3 additional unique references in the Figures).

The articles represent work from China, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Rwanda, Israel, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada, and the United States. Most of the articles were cohort or case studies, but we also drew upon information found in guidelines from hospitals and clinics instructing their staff on procedures to follow. In addition, we based some decisions on data collected by agencies such as the CDC, FDA, IHME, ISDA, and Worldometer. None of the case studies or cohort studies used a large number of participants. The largest group of participants numbered less than 500 and some case studies had fewer than 30 patients. However, the review of the literature revealed the need for individualized treatment protocols due to the variability of patient clinical presentation and survivability. A number of factors appear to influence mortality: the stage at which the patient first presented for care, pre-existing health conditions, age, and the viral load the patient carried.

Conclusion and RelevanceCOVID-19 can be divided into three distinct Stages, beginning at the time of infection (Stage I), sometimes progressing to pulmonary involvement (Stage II, with or without hypoxemia) and less frequently to systemic inflammation (Stage III). In addition to modeling the stages of disease progression, we have also created a treatment algorithm which considers age, comorbidities, clinical presentation, and disease progression to suggest drug classes or treatment modalities. This paper presents the first evidence-based recommendations for individualized treatment for COVID-19.

In response, many governments denied entry to travellers arriving from various countries affected by the virus. While several industries continue to experience economic losses due to the imposed interventions, it is unclear whether the different travel restrictions were successful in reducing COVID-19 importations. Here we develop a comprehensive framework to model daily COVID-19 importations, considering different travel bans. We quantify the temporal effects of the restrictions and elucidate the relationship between incidence rates in other countries, travel flows and the expected number of importations into the country under investigation. As a cases study, we evaluate the travel bans enforced by the Australian government. We find that international travel bans in Australia lowered COVID-19 importations by 87.68% (83.39 - 91.35) between January and June 2020. The presented framework can further be used to gain insights into how many importations to expect should borders re-open. Authorities may consider the presented information when planning a phased re-opening of international borders.","Liebig, J.; Najeebullah, K.; Jurdak, R.; El Shoghri, A.; Paini, D.",2020-10-14,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.10.11.20211060,1,Jessica Liebig,CSIRO,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.11.20211060v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.11.20211060v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,"NA"
6789,Predicting the Growth and Trend of COVID-19 Pandemic using Machine Learning and Cloud Computing,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe outbreak of COVID-19 Coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV-2, has created a calamitous situation throughout the world. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing day by day. Machine Learning (ML) and Cloud Computing can be deployed very effectively to track the disease, predict growth of the epidemic and design strategies and policy to manage its spread. This study applies an improved mathematical model to analyse and predict the growth of the epidemic. An ML-based improved model has been applied to predict the potential threat of COVID-19 in countries worldwide. We show that using iterative weighting for fitting Generalized Inverse Weibull distribution, a better fit can be obtained to develop a prediction framework. This can be deployed on a cloud computing platform for more accurate and real-time prediction of the growth behavior of the epidemic. A data driven approach with higher accuracy as here can be very useful for a proactive response from the government and citizens. Finally, we propose a set of research opportunities and setup grounds for further practical applications.

8838,A comparative evaluation of dye-based and probe-based RT-qPCR assay for the screening of SARS-CoV-2 using individual and pooled-sample testing.,"Effective interventions are mandatory to control the transmission and spread of SARS-CoV-2, a highly contagious virus causing devastating effects worldwide. Cost-effective approaches are pivotal tools required to increase the detection rates and escalate further in massive surveillance programs, especially in countries with limited resources that most of the efforts have focused on symptomatic cases only. Here, we compared the performance of the RT-qPCR using an intercalating dye with the probe-based assay. Then, we tested and compared these two RT-qPCR chemistries in different pooling systems: after RNA extraction (post-RNA extraction) and before RNA extraction (pre-RNA extraction) optimizing by pool size and template volume. We evaluated these approaches in 610 clinical samples. Our results show that the dye-based technique has a high analytical sensitivity similar to the probe-based detection assay used worldwide. Further, this assay may also be applicable in testing by pool systems post-RNA extraction up to 20 samples. However, the most efficient system for massive surveillance, the pre-RNA extraction pooling approach, was obtained with the probe-based assay in test up to 10 samples adding 13.5 {micro}L of RNA template. The low cost and the potential use in pre-RNA extraction pool systems, place of this assays as a valuable resource for scalable sampling to larger populations. Implementing a pool system for population sampling results in an important savings of laboratory resources and time, which are two key factors during an epidemic outbreak. Using the pooling approaches evaluated here, we are confident that it can be used as a valid alternative assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human samples.","Verdugo, C.; Plaza, A.; Acosta-Jamett, G.; Castro, N.; Gutierrez, J.; Hernandez, C.; Lopez-Joven, C.; Loncoman, C.; Navarrete, C.; Ramirez-Reveco, A.; Romero, A.; Silva, A.; Vega, M.; Verdugo, C.; Vergara, J.",2020-06-03,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.30.20117721,1,Claudio Verdugo,Universidad Austral de Chile,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.30.20117721v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.30.20117721v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
26257,Multi-site Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Mutation Detection Using a Multiplex Real-time RT-PCR Assay,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, which can be fatal and is responsible for a global pandemic. Variants with increased transmissibility or the potential to evade immunity have emerged and represent a threat to global pandemic control. Variants of concern (VOC) can be identified by sequencing of viral RNA, or by more rapid methods for detection of subsets of signature mutations.

MethodsWe developed a multiplex, real-time RT-PCR assay (cobas(R) SARS-CoV-2 Variant Set 1) for the qualitative detection and differentiation of three key SARS-CoV-2 mutations in the viral spike protein: del 69-70, E484K and N501Y. Analytical sensitivity and accuracy were evaluated at three testing sites using clinical specimens from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants belonging to several different lineages, including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1.

ResultsThe limit of detection for E484K was between 180 and 620 IU/mL for the three different isolates tested. For N501Y, the LOD was between 270 and 720 IU/mL (five isolates), while for del 69-70, it was 80 - 92 IU/mL (two isolates). Valid test results were obtained with all clinical specimens that were positive using routine diagnostic tests. Compared to sequencing (Sanger and next-generation), test results were 100% concordant at all three loci; no false positive or false negative results were observed.

ConclusionsData collected at three independent laboratories indicates excellent performance and concordance of cobas(R) SARS-CoV-2 Variant Set 1 with sequencing. New sets of primers and probes that target additional loci can be rapidly deployed in response to the identification of other emerging variants.","Bier, C.; Edelmann, A.; Theil, K.; Schwarzer, R.; Deichner, M.; Gessner, A.; Hiergeist, A.; Rentschler, U.; Gohl, P.; Kuchta, A.; Manohar, C.; Santini, C.; Duncan, D.; Canchola, J.; Sun, J.; Spier, G.; Simon, C.",2021-05-07,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.05.05.21254713,1,Christian Simon,"Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.05.21254713v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.05.21254713v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
8910,Estimating the parameters of SIR model of COVID-19 cases in India during lock down periods,"From the pandemic scenario of COVID-19 disease cases in all over the world, the outbreak prediction becomes very complex for the emerging scientifically research. Several epidemiological mathematical models of spread are increasing day by day to forecast correctly. Here, the classical SIR modelling approach is carried out to study the different parameters of this model in case of India county. This type of approach analyzed by considering different governmental lock down measures in India. There are some assumptions were taken into account for fitting the model in Python simulation in each lock down scenario. The predicted parameters of SIR model showed some improvement in each case of lock down in India. The outcome results showed the extreme interventions should be taken to tackle this type of pandemic situation in near future.

20810,Deep learning-based detection of COVID-19 using wearables data,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that is primarily diagnosed using laboratory tests, which are frequently not administered until after symptom onset. However, SARS-CoV-2 is contagious multiple days before symptom onset and diagnosis, thus enhancing its transmission through the population.

MethodsIn this retrospective study, we collected 15 seconds to one-minute heart rate and steps interval data from Fitbit devices during the COVID-19 period (February 2020 until June 2020). Resting heart rate was computed by selecting the heart rate intervals where steps were zero for 12 minutes ahead of an interrogated time point. Data for each participant was divided into train or baseline by taking the days before the non-infectious period and test data by taking the days during the COVID-19 infectious period. Data augmentation was used to increase the size of the training days. Here, we developed a deep learning approach based on a Long Short-Term Memory Networks-based autoencoder, called LAAD, to predict COVID-19 infection by detecting abnormal resting heart rate in test data relative to the users baseline.

FindingsWe detected an abnormal resting heart rate during the period of viral infection (7 days before the symptom onset and 21 days after) in 92% (23 out of 25 cases) of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. In 56% (14) of cases, LAAD detection identified cases in their pre-symptomatic phase whereas 36% (9 cases) were detected after the onset of symptoms with an average precision score of 0{middle dot}91 (SD 0{middle dot}13, 95% CI 0{middle dot}854-0{middle dot}967), a recall score of 0{middle dot}36 (0{middle dot}295, 0{middle dot}232-0{middle dot}487), and a F-beta score of 0{middle dot}79 (0{middle dot}226, 0{middle dot}693-0{middle dot}888). In COVID-19 positive patients, abnormal RHR patterns start 5 days before symptom onset (6{middle dot}9 days in pre-symptomatic cases and 1{middle dot}9 days later in post-symptomatic cases). COVID-19+ patients have longer abnormal resting heart rate periods (89 hours or 3{middle dot}7 days) as compared to healthy individuals (25 hours or 1{middle dot}1 days).

InterpretationThese findings show that deep learning neural networks and wearables data are an effective method for the early detection of COVID-19 infection. Additional validation data will help guide the use of this and similar techniques in real-world infection surveillance and isolation policies to reduce transmission and end the pandemic.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSCOVID-19 resulted in up to 1{middle dot}7 million deaths worldwide in 2020. COVID-19 detection using laboratory tests is usually performed after symptom onset. This delay can allow the spread of viral infection and can cause outbreaks. We searched PubMed, Google, and Google Scholar for research articles published in English up to Dec 1, 2020, using common search terms including """"COVID-19 and wearables"""", """"Resting heart rate and viral infection"""", """"Resting heart rate and COVID-19"""", """"machine learning and COVID-19"""" and """"deep-learning and COVID-19"""". Previous studies have attempted to use an elevated resting heart rate as an indicator of viral infection. Although these studies have investigated the early prediction of COVID-19 using resting heart rate and other wearables data, studies to investigate a deep learning-based prediction model with performance evaluation metrics at the user level has not been reported.

Added value of this studyIn this study, we created a deep-learning system that used wearables data such as abnormal resting heart rate to predict COVID-19 before the symptom onset. The deep-learning system was created using retrospective time-series datasets collected from 25 COVID-19+ patients, 11 non-COVID-19, and 70 healthy individuals. To our knowledge, this is the first deep-learning model to identify an early viral infection using wearables data at the user level. This study also greatly extends our previous phase-1 study and factors unpredictable behavior and time-series nature of the data, limited data size, and lack of data labels to evaluate performance metrics. The use of a real-time version of this model using more data along with user feedback may help to scale early detection as the number of patients with COVID-19 continues to grow.

Implications of all the available evidenceIn the future, wearable devices may provide high-resolution sleep, temperature, saturated oxygen, respiration rate, and electrocardiogram, which could be used to further characterize an individuals baseline and improve the deep-learning model performance for infectious disease detection. Using multi-sensor data with a real-time deep-learning model has the potential to alert individuals of illness prior to symptom onset and may greatly reduce the viral spread.","Bogu, G.

3505,"Clinical features, Diagnosis, and Treatment of COVID-19: A systematic review of case reports and case series","ObjectivesThe 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been declared a public health emergency worldwide. The objective of this systematic review was to characterize the clinical, diagnostic, and treatment characteristics of patients presenting with COVID-19.

MethodsWe conducted a structured search using PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library to collect both case reports and case series on COVID-19 published up to February 30, 2020.

ResultsThirty-four articles were included analyzing a total of 99 patients with a mean age of 46.2 years. The most common presenting symptom in patients who tested positive for COVID-19 was fever, reported in up to 83% of patients from 76.4% of the analyzed studies. Other symptoms including rhinorrhea, dizziness, and chills were less frequently reported. Additionally, in studies which reported C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements (44%), a large majority of patients displayed an elevated CRP (73%). Progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was the most common complication of patients testing positive for COVID-19 (33%). CT images displayed ground-glass opacification (GGO) patterns (80%) as well as bilateral lung involvement (71.0%). The most commonly used antiviral treatment modalities included, lopinavir (HIV protease inhibitor), arbidiol hydrochloride (influenza fusion inhibitor), and oseltamivir (neuraminidase inhibitor).

ConclusionsDevelopment of ARDS may play a role in estimating disease progression and mortality risk. Early detection of elevations in serum CRP, combined with a clinical COVID-19 symptom presentation may be used as a surrogate marker for presence and severity of disease. There is a paucity of data surrounding the efficacy of treatments. There is currently not a well-established gold standard therapy for the treatment of diagnosed COVID-19. Further prospective investigations are necessary.","Tahvildari, A.; Arbabi, M.; Farsi, Y.; Jamshidi, P.; Hasanzadeh, S.; Calcagno, T. M.; Nasiri, M.

14046,Chest X-ray image analysis and classification for COVID-19 pneumonia detection using Deep CNN,"In order to speed up the discovery of COVID-19 disease mechanisms, this research developed a new diagnosis platform using deep convolutional neural network (CNN) which is able to assist radiologists with diagnosis by distinguishing COVID-19 pneumonia from non-COVID-19 pneumonia in patients at Middlemore Hospital based on chest X-rays classification and analysis. Such a tool can save time in interpreting chest X-rays and increase the accuracy and thereby enhance our medical capacity for detection and diagnosis COVID-19. The research idea is that a set of X-ray medical lung images (which include normal, infected by bacteria, infected by virus including COVID-19) were used to train a deep CNN which can be able to distinguish between the noise and the useful information and then uses this training to interpret new images by recognizing patterns that indicate certain diseases such as coronavirus infection in the individual images. The supervised learning method is used as the process of learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a doctor supervising the learning process. It becomes more accurate as the number of analyzed images growing. In this way, it imitates the training for a doctor, but the theory is that since it is capable of learning from a far larger set of images than any human, can have the potential of being more accurate.","Gao, T.",2020-10-12,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.08.20.20178913,2,Terry Gao Sr.,CMDHB,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.20178913v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.20178913v2.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
20107,COVID-19 Network Model to Evaluate Vaccine Strategies towards Herd Immunity,"With more than 60 million confirmed cases and more than 1.5 million deaths, SARS-CoV-2 has paralyzed our societies, leading to self isolation and quarantine for several months. A COVID-19 vaccine remains a critical element in the eventual solution to this public health crisis. Two vaccines are ready to be mass produced and eventually supplied to the population. Here, we develop an epidemiological network model able to represent COVID-19 pandemic dynamics of different countries such as in Italy. Stochastic computational simulations identify the necessary number of vaccines and vaccine efficacy thresholds capable of preventing an epidemic whilst adhering to lockdown guidelines. Assuming a vaccine efficacy of 100% in a mass vaccination program, at least 60% of a given population should be vaccinated to obtain herd immunity. Otherwise, new waves of COVID-19 would be reported. However, reaching 60% of the population will be an unprecedented mass immunisation campaign that will take several months and millions of dollars. If the vaccine efficacy reports lower levels of efficacy in practice, then the coverage of vaccination would be needed to be even higher. Simulations suggest that the """"Ring of Vaccination"""" strategy, vaccinating susceptible contact and contact of contacts, would be a more tractable vaccine strategy to prevent the new waves of COVID-19 meanwhile a high percent of the population is vaccinated.","Tetteh, J.

20533,"The Joint Impact of COVID-19 Vaccination and Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions on Infections, Hospitalizations, and Mortality: An Agent-Based Simulation","BackgroundVaccination against SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to significantly reduce transmission and morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. This modeling study simulated the comparative and joint impact of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and coverage with and without non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on total infections, hospitalizations, and deaths.

MethodsAn agent-based simulation model was employed to estimate incident SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and deaths over 18 months for the State of North Carolina, a population of roughly 10.5 million. Vaccine efficacy of 50% and 90% and vaccine coverage of 25%, 50%, and 75% (at the end of a 6-month distribution period) were evaluated. Six vaccination scenarios were simulated with NPIs (i.e., reduced mobility, school closings, face mask usage) maintained and removed during the period of vaccine distribution.

ResultsIn the worst-case vaccination scenario (50% efficacy and 25% coverage), 2,231,134 new SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred with NPIs removed and 799,949 infections with NPIs maintained. In contrast, in the best-case scenario (90% efficacy and 75% coverage), there were 450,575 new infections with NPIs maintained and 527,409 with NPIs removed. When NPIs were removed, lower efficacy (50%) and higher coverage (75%) reduced infection risk by a greater magnitude than higher efficacy (90%) and lower coverage (25%) compared to the worst-case scenario (absolute risk reduction 13% and 8%, respectively).

ConclusionSimulation results suggest that premature lifting of NPIs while vaccines are distributed may result in substantial increases in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Furthermore, as NPIs are removed, higher vaccination coverage with less efficacious vaccines can contribute to a larger reduction in risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to more efficacious vaccines at lower coverage. Our findings highlight the need for well-resourced and coordinated efforts to achieve high vaccine coverage and continued adherence to NPIs before many pre-pandemic activities can be resumed.","Patel, M.

7599,A structured model for COVID-19 spread: modelling age and healthcare inequities,"We use a stochastic branching process model, structured by age and level of healthcare access, to look at the heterogeneous spread of COVID-19 within a population. We examine the effect of control scenarios targeted at particular groups, such as school closures or social distancing by older people. Although we currently lack detailed empirical data about contact and infection rates between age groups and groups with different levels of healthcare access within New Zealand, these scenarios illustrate how such evidence could be used to inform specific interventions. We find that an increase in the transmission rates amongst children from reopening schools is unlikely to significantly increase the number of cases, unless this is accompanied by a change in adult behaviour. We also find that there is a risk of undetected outbreaks occurring in communities that have low access to healthcare and that are socially isolated from more privileged communities. The greater the degree of inequity and extent of social segregation, the longer it will take before any outbreaks are detected. Well-established evidence for health inequities, particularly in accessing primary healthcare and testing, indicates that Maori and Pacific peoples are at higher risk of undetected outbreaks in Aotearoa New Zealand. This highlights the importance of ensuring that community needs for access to healthcare, including early proactive testing, rapid contact tracing, and the ability to isolate, are being met equitably. Finally, these scenarios illustrate how information concerning contact and infection rates across different demographic groups may be useful in informing specific policy interventions.","James, A.; Plank, M.

Following the CDC health and safety guidelines, we test the concept using the culturing supernatant contain SARS-CoV-2 particles, and its full-length sequence was used for further analysis. The fraction of SARS-CoV-2 endogenous DNA was 93.47% with Cluster Factor about 1.1, which demonstrate that the numbers of mapped reads to SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence significantly increased, compared to metagenomic sequencing technology, following SARS-CoV-2 probe enrichment. Moreover, based on the high-quality sequence, we discussed the heterozygosity and viral expression during replication of coronavirus, and its phylogenetic relationship with other selected high-quality samples from The Genome Variation Map (GVM) (on 2020/03/22). We believe this manuscript is valuable for all the researchers who are interested in using clinical warp samples to obtain the high coverage of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence with a relatively low concentration of viral particles.

Nasal and oral swabs were placed in both viral transport media (VTM) and eNAT, a sterilizing transport buffer, prior to testing with the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Xpert) test. The sensitivity of each sampling strategy was compared using a composite positive standard. Overall, swab specimens collected in eNAT showed superior sensitivity compared to swabs in VTM (70% vs 57%, P=0.0022). Direct saliva 90.5%, (95% CI: 82%, 95%), followed by NP swabs in VTM and saliva in eNAT, was significantly more sensitive than nasal swabs in VTM (50%, P<0.001) or eNAT (67.8%, P=0.0012) and oral swabs in VTM (50%, P<0.0001) or eNAT (56%, P<0.0001). Saliva and use of eNAT buffer each increased detection of SARS-CoV-2 with the Xpert test; however, no single sample matrix identified all positive cases.","Banada, P.

4291,Application of COVID-19 pneumonia diffusion data to predict epidemic situation,"ObjectiveTo evaluate novel coronavirus pneumonia cases by establishing the mathematical model of the number of confirmed cases daily, and to assess the current situation and development of the epidemic situation, so as to provide a digital basis for decision-making.

MethodsThe number of newly confirmed covid-19 cases per day was taken as the research object, and the seven-day average value (M) and the sequential value (R) of M were calculated to study the occurrence and development of covid-19 epidemic through the analysis of charts and data.

ResultsM reflected the current situation of epidemic development; R reflected the current level of infection and the trend of epidemic development.

ConclusionThe current data can be used to evaluate the number of people who have been infected, and when R < 1, the peak of epidemic can be predicted.

PrefaceIn December 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia with unknown causes were found in some hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. On 11 March 2020, the director-general of the world health organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced that based on the assessment, WHO believes that the current outbreak of COVID-19 can be called a global pandemic. By early April 2020, there were more than one million confirmed cases worldwide.

COVID-19 has developed from sporadic cases to pandemic in a short period of 3 months. The analysis and research of its infectious data will help to prevent and control the next stage of epidemic prevention and other infectious diseases in the future.

In this paper, COVID-19 rounded average of seven days (M), and Ms ring ratio (R) are used to predict the current potential patients data, and the relative state of epidemic prevention and control is judged through the graphic features and characteristic data, so as to provide evidence for the prevention and control decisions.","Wu, Z.",2020-04-14,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.11.20061432,1,Zhenguo Wu,Xi\'an Jioatong University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20061432v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20061432v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
22459,A surrogate virus neutralization test to quantify antibody-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in finger stick dried blood spot samples,"BackgroundThe spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 engages the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter host cells, and neutralizing antibodies are effective at blocking this interaction to prevent infection. Widespread application of this important marker of protective immunity is limited by logistical and technical challenges associated with live virus methods and venous blood collection. To address this gap, we validated an immunoassay-based method for quantifying neutralization of the spike-ACE2 interaction in a single drop of capillary whole blood, collected on filter paper as a dried blood spot (DBS) sample.

MethodsSamples are eluted overnight and incubated in the presence of spike antigen and ACE2 in a 96-well solid phase plate. Competitive immunoassay with electrochemiluminescent label is used to quantify neutralizing activity. The following measures of assay performance were evaluated: dilution series of confirmed positive and negative samples, agreement with results from matched DBS-serum samples, analysis of results from DBS samples with known COVID-19 status, and precision (intra-assay percent coefficient of variation; %CV) and reliability (inter-assay; %CV).

ResultsDilution series produced the expected pattern of dose-response. Agreement between results from serum and DBS samples was high, with concordance correlation = 0.991. Analysis of three control samples across the measurement range indicated acceptable levels of precision and reliability. Median % neutralization was 46.9 for PCR confirmed convalescent COVID-19 samples and 0.1 for negative samples.

ConclusionsLarge-scale testing is important for quantifying neutralizing antibodies that can provide protection against COVID-19 in order to estimate the level of immunity in the general population. DBS provides a minimally-invasive, low cost alternative to venous blood collection, and this scalable immunoassay-based method for quantifying neutralization of the spike-ACE2 interaction can be used as a surrogate for virus-based assays to expand testing across a wide range of settings and populations.","Sancilio, A.; D'aquila, R.; Mcnally, E.; Velez, M.; Ison, M.; Demonbreun, A.

12851,Impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures on the incidence of preterm birth: a national quasi-experimental study,"IntroductionPreterm birth is the leading cause of child mortality globally, with many survivors experiencing long-term adverse consequences. Preliminary evidence suggests that preterm births dropped dramatically following implementation of policy measures aimed at mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsWe undertook a national quasi-experimental difference-in-regression-discontinuity approach to study the impact of the COVID-19 mitigation measures implemented in the Netherlands in a stepwise fashion on 9, 15, and 23 March 2020 on the incidence of preterm birth. We used data from the neonatal dried blood spot screening programme (2010-2020) and cross-validated these against national perinatal registry data. Stratified analyses were conducted according to gestational age subgroups, and sensitivity analyses to assess robustness of the findings. We explored potential effect modification by neighbourhood socio-economic status.

ResultsData on 1,599,547 singleton newborns were available, including 56,720 post-implementation births. Consistent reductions in preterm birth were seen across various time windows surrounding implementation of the 9 March COVID-19 mitigation measures: {+/-}2 months (n=531,823): odds ratio 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.66-0.91), p=0.002; {+/-}3 months (n=796,531): 0.85 (0.73-0.98), p=0.028; {+/-}4 months (n=1,066,872): 0.84 (0.73-0.97), p=0.023. Decreases observed following the 15 March measures were of smaller magnitude and not statistically significant. No changes were observed after 23 March. Preterm birth reductions after 9 March were consistent across gestational age strata and robust in sensitivity analyses. They appeared confined to high-socioeconomic status neighbourhoods, but effect modification was not statistically significant.

ConclusionIn this national quasi-experimental study, initial implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures was associated with a 15-23% drop in preterm births in the following months, in agreement with preliminary observations in other countries. It is now of pivotal importance that integration of comparable data from across the globe is undertaken to further substantiate these findings and start exploring the underlying mechanisms.","Been, J.

21672,Multinational Prevalence of Neurological Phenotypes in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19,"OBJECTIVENeurological complications can worsen outcomes in COVID-19. We defined the prevalence of a wide range of neurological conditions among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in geographically diverse multinational populations.

METHODSUsing electronic health record (EHR) data from 348 participating hospitals across 6 countries and 3 continents between January and September 2020, we performed a cross-sectional study of hospitalized adult and pediatric patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test, both with and without severe COVID-19. We assessed the frequency of each disease category and 3-character International Classification of Disease (ICD) code of neurological diseases by countries, sites, time before and after admission for COVID-19, and COVID-19 severity.

RESULTSAmong the 35,177 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, there was increased prevalence of disorders of consciousness (5.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.7%-7.8%, pFDR<.001) and unspecified disorders of the brain (8.1%, 95%CI: 5.7%-10.5%, pFDR<.001), compared to pre-admission prevalence. During hospitalization, patients who experienced severe COVID-19 status had 22% (95%CI: 19%-25%) increase in the relative risk (RR) of disorders of consciousness, 24% (95%CI: 13%-35%) increase in other cerebrovascular diseases, 34% (95%CI: 20%-50%) increase in nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage, 37% (95%CI: 17%-60%) increase in encephalitis and/or myelitis, and 72% (95%CI: 67%-77%) increase in myopathy compared to those who never experienced severe disease.

12077,Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia: results from the prospective AspCOVID-19 study,"BackgroundSuperinfections, including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), are well-known complications of critically ill patients with severe viral pneumonia. Aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence, risk factors and outcome of IPA in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

MethodsWe prospectively screened 32 critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia for a time period of 28 days using a standardized study protocol for oberservation of developement of COVID-19 associated invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). We collected laboratory, microbiological, virological and clinical parameters at defined timepoints in combination with galactomannan-antigen-detection from bronchial aspirates. We used logistic regression analyses to assess if COVID-19 was independently associated with IPA and compared it with matched controls.

FindingsCAPA was diagnosed at a median of 4 days after ICU admission in 11/32 (34%) of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia as compared to 8% in the control cohort.

In the COVID-19 cohort, mean age, APACHE II score and ICU mortality were higher in patients with CAPA than in patients without CAPA (36% versus 9.5%; p<0.001). ICU stay (21 versus 17 days; p=0.340) and days of mechanical ventilation (20 versus 15 days; p=0.570) were not different between both groups. In regression analysis COVID-19 and APACHE II score were independently associated with IPA.

InterpretationCAPA is highly prevalent and associated with a high mortality rate. COVID-19 is independently associated with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. A standardized screening and diagnostic approach as presented in our study can help to identify affected patients at an early stage.

20074,The Association Between Alpha-1 Adrenergic Receptor Antagonists and In-Hospital Mortality from COVID-19,"Effective therapies for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are urgently needed, and preclinical data suggest alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists (1-AR antagonists) may be effective in reducing mortality related to hyperinflammation independent of etiology. Using a retrospective cohort design with patients in the Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system, we use doubly robust regression and matching to estimate the association between baseline use of 1-AR antagonists and likelihood of death due to COVID-19 during hospitalization. Having an active prescription for any 1-AR antagonist (tamsulosin, silodosin, prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin, or alfuzosin) at the time of admission had a significant negative association with in-hospital mortality (relative risk reduction 18%; odds ratio 0.73; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.85; p [&le;] 0.001) and death within 28 days of admission (relative risk reduction 17%; odds ratio 0.74; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.84; p [&le;] 0.001). In a subset of patients on doxazosin specifically, an inhibitor of all three alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, we observed a relative risk reduction for death of 74% (odds ratio 0.23; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.94; p = 0.028) compared to matched controls not on any 1-AR antagonist at the time of admission. These findings suggest that use of 1-AR antagonists may reduce mortality in COVID-19, supporting the need for randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with early symptomatic infection.","Rose, L.; Graham, L.; Koenecke, A.; Powell, M.; Xiong, R.; Shen, Z.; Kinzler, K.; Bettegowda, C.; Vogelstein, B.; Athey, S.; Vogelstein, J.; Konig, M.

13317,Protocol for a Rapid Scoping Review of Evidence of Outdoor Transmission of COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic is both a global health crisis, and a civic emergency for national governments, including the UK. As countries across the world loosen their lockdown restrictions, the assumption is generally made that the risk of COVID-19 transmission is lower outdoors, and this assumption has shaped decisions about what activities can re-commence, the circumstances in which they should re-commence, and the conditions under which they should re-commence. This is important for events and activities that generate mass gatherings, particularly mass participation sports events such as running, but also events in other sectors such as concerts, carnivals and festivals.

This paper sets out a protocol for a rapid scoping review of evidence of incidents of outdoor transmission of COVID-19, including the settings, environments and circumstances of such transmission, and their comparative prevalence to incidents of indoor transmission.

13061,Features and Functions of Systemic and Mucosal Humoral Immunity Among SARS-CoV-2 Convalescent Individuals,"Understanding humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection will play a critical role in the development of vaccines and antibody-based interventions. We report systemic and mucosal antibody responses in convalescent individuals who experienced varying disease severity. Robust antibody responses to diverse SARS-CoV-2 antigens and evidence of elevated responses to endemic CoV were observed among convalescent donors. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG responses were often negatively correlated, particularly in mucosal samples, suggesting subject-intrinsic biases in isotype switching. Assessment of antibody-mediated effector functions revealed an inverse correlation between systemic and mucosal neutralization activity and site-dependent differences in the isotype of neutralizing antibodies. Serum neutralization correlated with systemic anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM response magnitude, while mucosal neutralization was associated with nasal SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA. These findings begin to map how diverse Ab characteristics relate to Ab functions and outcomes of infection, informing public health assessment strategies and vaccine development efforts.","Butler, S.

27375,Virologic features of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children,"BackgroundData on viral factors causing pediatric disease and guidance for pediatric-specific considerations have lagged behind adults throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. As COVID-19 infections and deaths increase in the pediatric population, characterization of SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics in children would enable data-driven public health guidance.

MethodsNasal swabs collected from children with COVID-19 were analyzed. Viral load was quantified by RT-PCR; viral culture was assessed by direct observation of cytopathic effects and semiquantitative viral titers. Correlations with age or symptom duration were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 whole genome amplification was compared with contemporaneous Massachusetts sequences to assess for clustering patterns.

ResultsNinety-seven children with COVID-19 (median age 10 years, range 2 weeks-22 years) were included in this study. Age did not impact SARS-CoV-2 viral load in nasal secretions: children of all ages were equally likely to carry live, replicating virus. Children within the first five days of illness had higher viral loads and rates of culture positivity, and viral load in hospitalized children (n=30) did not differ from hospitalized adults (n=21) with similar duration of symptoms. While pediatric SARS-CoV-2 sequences were representative of those in the community, novel variants were identified.

ConclusionsChildren can carry high quantities of live, replicating virus, creating a potential reservoir for transmission and evolution of genetic variants. As guidance around social distancing and masking evolves following vaccine uptake in older populations, a clear understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in children is critical for rational development of public health policies and vaccination strategies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.

Key points- Infants, children and adolescents are equally capable of carrying live, replicating SARS-CoV-2 in their nasal secretions.
- Respiratory secretions of infants, children and adolescents with COVID-19 are most infectious before symptoms develop and during the first five days of illness.
- Children can harbor SARS-CoV-2 variants that could have implications for disease severity and vaccine efficacy.","Yonker, L. M.; Boucau, J.; Regan, J.; Choudhary, M. C.; Burns, M.

19835,Socioeconomic inequalities associated with mortality for COVID-19 in Colombia: A cohort nation-wide study,"BackgroundAfter eight months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Latin American countries have some of the highest rates in COVID-19 mortality. Despite being one of the most unequal regions of the world, there is a scarce report of the effect of socioeconomic conditions on COVID-19 mortality in their countries. We aimed to identify the effect of some socioeconomic inequality-related factors on COVID-19 mortality in Colombia.

MethodsWe conducted a survival analysis in a nation-wide retrospective cohort study of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Colombia from March 2nd to October 26th, 2020. We calculated the time to death or recovery for each confirmed case in the cohort. We used an extended multivariable time-dependent Cox regression model to estimate the hazard risk ratio (HR) by age groups, sex, ethnicity, type of health insurance, area of residence, and socioeconomic strata.

ResultsThere were 1 033 218 confirmed cases and 30 565 deaths for COVID-19 in Colombia between March 2nd and October 26th. The risk of dying for COVID-19 among confirmed cases was higher in males (HR=1.68 95% CI: 1.64-1.72), in people older than 60 years (HR=296.58 95% CI: 199.22-441.51), in indigenous people (HR=1.20 95% CI: 1.08-1.33), in people with subsidized health insurance regime (HR=1.89 95% CI: 1.83-1.96), and in people living in the very low socioeconomic strata (HR=1.44 95% CI: 1.24-1.68).

The majority of patients with COVID-19 have a good prognosis, but variable percentages in different countries develop pneumonia associated with lymphocytopenia and severe inflammatory response due to uncontrolled release of cytokines. These immune mediators are transcriptionally regulated by JAK-STAT molecular pathways, which can be disabled by small molecules. Here, we provide evidences on the efficacy of baricitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, in correcting the immune abnormalities observed in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Indeed, we demonstrate a significant reduction in serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1{beta} and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a rapid recovery in circulating T and B cell frequencies and an increased antibody production against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in baricitinib-treated patients. Moreover, treated patients underwent a rapid reduction in oxygen flow need and progressive increase in the P/F.

PubMed, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, Global Health and google scholars were searched comprehensively for articles, preprints, grey literatures, reports, websites, conference proceedings and expert information. Studies conducted in human and published in English language were included in the analysis. All the findings and statements of the review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in citations.

ResultsWe identified 360 records, of which 50 studies met the inclusion criteria. We synthesized the data from the included records and dig out the deep insights of them and pooled into this review. The burden of the outbreak is worsening due to overcrowding, presence of asymptomatic carriers, scarcity of test kits, the immune escaping ability of the virus and lack of awareness.

Conclusions and recommendationsDue to the fast-spreading nature of COVID-19 the prevention and control strategies become challenging. It is imposing social, psychological, and socio-economic impacts. We recommended that following social distancing, isolation suspects, using personal protective equipment, health education and introducing hand-washing practices, avoiding contact with animals, vaccine development and treatment for controlling and prevention.","Berhe, B.; Legese, H.; Degefa, H.; Adhanom, G.; Gebrewahd, A.; Mardu, F.; Tesfay, K.; Welay, M.; Negash, H.",2020-04-06,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.04.02.20051052,1,Hadush Negash,"Adigrat University, College of Health Sciences",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051052v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051052v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
18165,"Two-step strategy for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern 202012/01 and other variants with spike deletion H69-V70, France, August to December 2020","We report the implementation of a two-step strategy for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying the spike deletion H69-V70 ({Delta}H69/{Delta}V70). This spike deletion resulted in a S-gene target failure (SGTF) of a three-target RT-PCR assay (TaqPath kit). Whole genome sequencing performed on 37 samples with SGTF revealed several receptor-binding domain mutations co-occurring with {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70. More importantly, this strategy enabled the first detection of the variant of concern 202012/01 in France on December 21th 2020.

Since September a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) deletion H69-V70 ({Delta}H69/{Delta}V70) has attracted increasing attention. This deletion was detected in the cluster-5 variant identified both in minks and humans in Denmark. This cluster-5 variant carries a receptor binding domain (RBD) mutation Y453F and was associated with reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies to sera from recovered COVID-19 patients [1-3]. The {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70 has also co-occurred with two other RBD mutations of increasing interest [4]: N439K that is currently spreading in Europe and might also have reduced susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [5]; and N501Y that is part of the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) 202012/01 recently detected in England [6]. Although the impact of {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70 on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is not clear, enhanced surveillance is urgently needed. Herein we report the implementation of a two-step strategy enabling a rapid detection of VOC 202012/01 or other variants carrying {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70.","Bal, A.; Destras, G.; Gaymard, A.; Marlet, J.; Stefic, K.; Regue, H.; Semanas, Q.; D'aubarde, C.; Billaud, G.; Laurent, F.; Gonzales, C.; Valette, M.; Bouscambert, M.; Gaudy-Graffin, C.; Lina, B.; Morfin, F.; Josset, L.",2021-01-11,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.11.10.20228528,3,Laurence Josset,HCL,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.10.20228528v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.10.20228528v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.3.2100008
8554,How Efficacious Must a COVID-19 Coronavirus Vaccine be to Prevent or Stop an Epidemic by Itself,"BackgroundGiven the continuing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and much of the U.S. implementing social distancing due to the lack of alternatives, there has been a push to develop a vaccine to eliminate the need for social distancing.

MethodsIn 2020, we developed a computational model of the U.S. simulating the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus and vaccination.

ResultsSimulation experiments revealed that when vaccine efficacy exceeded 70%, coverage exceeded 60%, and vaccination occurred on day 1, the attack rate dropped to 22% with daily cases not exceeding 3.2 million (reproductive rate, R0, 2.5). When R0 was 3.5, the attack rate dropped to 41% with daily cases not exceeding 14.4 million. Increasing coverage to 75% when vaccination occurred by day 90 resulted in 5% attack rate and daily cases not exceeding 258,029when R0 was 2.5 and a 26% attack rate and maximum daily cases of 22.6 million when R0 was 3.5. When vaccination did not occur until day 180, coverage (i.e., those vaccinated plus those otherwise immune) had to reach 100%. A vaccine with an efficacy between 40% and 70% could still obviate the need for other measures under certain circumstances such as much higher, and in some cases, potentially unachievable, vaccination coverages.

ConclusionOur study found that to either prevent or largely extinguish an epidemic without any other measures (e.g., social distancing), the vaccine has to have an efficacy of at least 70%.","Bartsch, S.

3713,Pre-outbreak determinants of perceived risks of corona infection and preventive measures taken. A prospective population-based study,"ObjectivesAssess how people perceive the risks of coronavirus infection, whether people take preventive measures, and which (pre-outbreak) factors contribute to the perceived risks and measures taken, such as (pre-outbreak) respiratory problems, heart problems, diabetes, anxiety and depression symptoms, loneliness, age, gender, marital status and education level.

MethodsData were collected in the longitudinal LISS panel, based on a random sample of the Dutch population. The coronavirus survey started on March 2, and the data collection ended on March 17 2020. Data were linked with surveys on health and social integration conducted at the end of 2019 (Nstudy sample=3,540).

ResultsAbout 15% perceived the risk of infection as high, and 11% the risk becoming ill when infected. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed the following. Older age-groups perceived the risk for coronavirus infection as lower (all adjusted Odd Ratios [aOR] [&le;] .058). In total, 43.8% had taken preventive measures, especially females (aOR=1.47, 95% CI=1.27-1.69). Those with lower education levels less often used preventive measures (aOR=0.56, 95% CI=0.46-0.69). Those with pre-outbreak respiratory problems (aOR=2.89, 95% CI=2.24-3.73), heart problems (aOR=2.17, 95% CI=1.49-3.16) and diabetes (aOR=3.10, 95% CI=2.02-4.74) perceived the risk becoming ill when infected as higher than others. However, respondents with pre-outbreak respiratory problems and diabetes did not more often take preventive measures.

ConclusionsVulnerable patients more often recognize that they are at risk becoming ill when infected by the coronavirus, but many do not take preventive measures. Interventions to stimulate the use of preventive measures should pay additional attention to physically vulnerable patients, men and those with lower education levels.","Van Der Velden, P.

Often, genomic studies rely on remnant diagnostic material, typically nasopharyngeal swabs, as input into whole genome SARS-CoV-2 next-generation sequencing pipelines. Saliva has proven to be a safe and stable specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via traditional diagnostic assays, however saliva is not commonly used for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. Using the ARTIC Network amplicon-generation approach with sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore MinION, we demonstrate that sequencing SARS-CoV-2 from saliva produces genomes comparable to those from nasopharyngeal swabs, and that RNA extraction is necessary to generate complete genomes from saliva. In this study, we show that saliva is a useful specimen type for genomic studies of SARS-CoV-2.","Alpert, T.; Vogels, C. B. F.; Breban, M. I.; Petrone, M.; Yale Impact Research Team,  ; Wyllie, A.

17070,"SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the Southern Region of New Zealand, 2020","BackgroundDuring New Zealands first outbreak in early 2020 the Southern Region had the highest per capita SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. PCR testing was initially limited by a narrow case definition and limited laboratory capacity, so cases may have been missed.

ObjectivesTo evaluate the Abbott(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgG nucleocapsid assay, alongside spike-based assays, and to determine the frequency of antibodies among PCR-confirmed and probable cases, contacts, and higher risk individuals in the Southern Region of NZ.

Study designPre-pandemic sera (n=300) were used to establish assay specificity and sera from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients (n=78) to establish sensitivity. For prevalence analysis, all samples (n=1214) were tested on the Abbott assay, and all PCR-confirmed cases (n=78), probable cases (n=9), and higher risk individuals with grey-zone (n=14) or positive results (n=11) were tested on four additional SARS-CoV-2 serological assays.

ResultsThe median time from infection onset to serum collection for PCR-confirmed cases was 14 weeks (range 11-17 weeks). The Abbott assay demonstrated a specificity of 99.7% (95% CI, 98.2%-99.99%) and a sensitivity of 76.9% (95% CI, 66.0%-85.7%). Spike-based assays demonstrated superior sensitivity ranging 89.7-94.9%. Nine previously undiagnosed sero-positive individuals were identified, and all had epidemiological risk factors.

ConclusionsSpike-based assays demonstrated higher sensitivity than the Abbott IgG assay, likely due to temporal differences in antibody persistence. No unexpected SARS-CoV-2 infections were found in the Southern region of NZ, supporting the elimination status of the country at the time this study was conducted.","Craigie, A.; Mcgregor, R.; Whitcombe, A.; Carlton, L.; Harte, D.; Sutherland, M.; Parry, M.; Smit, E.; Mcauliffe, G.; Ussher, J.; Moreland, N.; Jack, S.; Upton, A.",2020-10-23,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.20.20215616,1,Arlo Upton,"Southern Community Laboratories, Dunedin, New Zealand",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.20.20215616v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.20.20215616v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.pathol.2021.04.001

The efficacy of each model is tested in terms of predictions made for the next two weeks. The infectivity rates are found to be ever-increasing in the case of the five initial models. The infectivity rate for the sixth model, which is based on the data from 13th February to 14th May 2021, shows a decreasing nature with an increase in time. This indicates a decline in the second wave, which may start from 4th June 2021 according to the fitted parameters.","Viswanath, N.

9336,An Aberration Detection-Based Approach for Sentinel Syndromic Surveillance of COVID-19 and Other Novel Influenza-Like Illnesses,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a significant global concern, triggering harsh public health restrictions in a successful bid to curb its exponential growth. As discussion shifts towards relaxation of these restrictions, there is significant concern of second-wave resurgence. The key to managing these outbreaks is early detection and intervention, and yet there is significant lag time associated with usage of laboratory confirmed cases for surveillance purposes. To address this, syndromic surveillance can be considered to provide a timelier alternative for first-line screening. Existing syndromic surveillance solutions are however typically focused around a known disease and have limited capability to distinguish between outbreaks of individual diseases sharing similar syndromes. This poses a challenge for surveillance of COVID-19 as its active periods are tend to overlap temporally with other influenza-like illnesses. In this study we explore performing sentinel syndromic surveillance for COVID-19 and other influenza-like illnesses using a deep learning-based approach. Our methods are based on aberration detection utilizing autoencoders that leverages symptom prevalence distributions to distinguish outbreaks of two ongoing diseases that share similar syndromes, even if they occur concurrently. We first demonstrate that this approach works for detection of outbreaks of influenza, which has known temporal boundaries. We then demonstrate that the autoencoder can be trained to not alert on known and well-managed influenza-like illnesses such as the common cold and influenza. Finally, we applied our approach to 2019-2020 data in the context of a COVID-19 syndromic surveillance task to demonstrate how implementation of such a system could have provided early warning of an outbreak of a novel influenza-like illness that did not match the symptom prevalence profile of influenza and other known influenza-like illnesses.","Wen, A.; Wang, L.; He, H.; Liu, S.; Fu, S.; Sohn, S.; Kugel, J.

4993,Cluster of COVID-19 in northern France: A retrospective closed cohort study,"BackgroundThe Oise department in France has been heavily affected by COVID-19 in early 2020.

MethodsBetween 30 March and 4 April 2020, we conducted a retrospective closed cohort study among pupils, their parents and siblings, as well as teachers and non-teaching staff of a high-school located in Oise. Participants completed a questionnaire that covered history of fever and/or respiratory symptoms since 13 January 2020 and had blood tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The infection attack rate (IAR) was defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection based on antibody detection. Blood samples from two blood donor centres collected between 23 and 27 March 2020 in the Oise department were also tested for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

FindingsOf the 661 participants (median age: 37 years), 171 participants had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The overall IAR was 25.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 22.6-29.4), and the infection fatality rate was 0% (one-sided 97.5% CI = 0 - 2.1). Nine of the ten participants hospitalised since mid-January were in the infected group, giving a hospitalisation rate of 5.3% (95% CI = 2.4 -9.8). Anosmia and ageusia had high positive predictive values for SARS-CoV-2 infection (84.7% and 88.1%, respectively). Smokers had a lower IAR compared to non-smokers (7.2% versus 28.0%, P <0.001). The proportion of infected individuals who had no symptoms during the study period was 17.0% (95% CI = - 23.4). The proportion of donors with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in two nearby blood banks of the Oise department was 3.0% (95% CI = 1.1 - 6.4).

InterpretationThe relatively low IAR observed in an area where SARS-CoV-2 actively circulated weeks before confinement measures indicates that establishing herd immunity will take time, and that lifting these measures in France will be long and complex.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSThe first COVID-19 cases in France were reported on 24 January 2020. Substantial transmission has occurred since then, with the Oise department, north of Paris, one of the heaviest affected areas in the early stages of the epidemic in France. As of 13 April 2020, 98,076 cases had been diagnosed in France, including 5,379 deaths.

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been widely reported, but this has largely been centred on cases requiring medical care. What remains unclear at this stage is the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 infections may be asymptomatic or present as subclinical, non-specific symptoms. While extensive contact tracing has identified asymptomatic infections using RT-PCR testing, serologic detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is needed to determine the real infection attack rate and the proportion of all infections that are asymptomatic or subclinical.

Added value of this studyUsing a combination of serologic assays with high sensitivity and specificity for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, we conducted a retrospective closed cohort study. In a high school linked to a cluster of COVID-19 in the Oise department, we showed an overall infection attack rate (IAR) of 40.9% in the high school group, and 10.9% in parents and siblings of the pupils. The proportion of infected individuals who had no symptoms during the study period was 17.0%.

Implications of all of the available evidenceThe relatively low IAR in this area where SARS-CoV-2 actively circulated before confinement measures were introduced indicates that establishing herd immunity will take time, and that the lifting of these measures in France will be long and complex.","Fontanet, A.; Tondeur, L.; Madec, Y.; Grant, R.; Besombes, C.; Jolly, N.; Fernandes Pellerin, S.; Ungeheuer, M.-N.; Cailleau, I.; Kuhmel, L.; Temmam, S.; Huon, C.; Chen, K.-Y.; Crescenzo, B.; Munier, S.; Demeret, C.; Grzelak, L.; Staropoli, I.; Bruel, T.; Gallian, P.; Cauchemez, S.; Van Der Werf, S.; Schwartz, O.; Eloit, M.; Hoen, B.",2020-04-23,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.18.20071134,1,Arnaud Fontanet,Institut Pasteur,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.18.20071134v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.18.20071134v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.15.2001695
27738,Coupling freedom from disease principles and early warning from wastewater surveillance to improve health security,"Infectious disease surveillance is vitally important to maintaining health security, but these efforts are challenged by the pace at which new pathogens emerge. Wastewater surveillance can rapidly obtain population-level estimates of disease transmission, and we leverage freedom from disease principles to make use of non-detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater to estimate the probability that a community is free from SARS-CoV-2 transmission. From wastewater surveillance of 24 treatment plants across upstate New York beginning in May 2020, we observed a reliable limit of detection of 0.3--0.5 cases per 10,000 population. No COVID-19 cases were reported 40% of the time following a non-detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, and cases were less than 1 daily case per 10,000 population 97% of the time following non-detection. Trends in the intensity of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater correlate with trends in COVID-19 incidence and test positivity ({rho}>0.5), with the greatest correlation observed for active cases and a three-day lead time between wastewater sample date and clinical test date. Wastewater surveillance can cost-effectively demonstrate the geographic extent of the transmission of emerging pathogens, confirming that transmission is absent or under control and alerting of an increase in transmission. If a statewide wastewater surveillance platform had been in place prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers would have been able to complement the representative nature of wastewater samples to individual testing, likely resulting in more precise public health interventions and policies.","Larsen, D.

15217,Dual Attention Multiple Instance Learning with Unsupervised Complementary Loss for COVID-19 Screening,"Chest computed tomography (CT) based analysis and diagnosis of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) plays a key role in combating the outbreak of the pandemic that has rapidly spread worldwide. To date, the disease has infected more than 18 million people with over 690k deaths reported. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) is the current gold standard for clinical diagnosis but may produce false positives; thus, chest CT based diagnosis is considered more viable. However, accurate screening is challenging due to difficulty in annotation efforts of infected areas, curation of large datasets, and the slight discrepancies between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia. In this study, we propose an attention-based end-to-end weakly supervised framework for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia based on multiple instance learning (MIL). We further incorporate unsupervised contrastive learning for improved accuracy with attention applied both in spatial and latent contexts, herein we propose Dual Attention Contrastive based MIL (DA-CMIL). DA-CMIL takes as input a several patient CT slices (considered as a bag of instances) and outputs a single label. Attention based pooling is applied to implicitly select key slices in latent space, and spatial attention learns slice spatial context for interpretable diagnosis. A contrastive loss is applied at the instance level to encode similarity in features from the same patient against pooled patient features. Empirical results show our algorithm achieves an overall accuracy of 98.6% and an AUC of 98.4%. Moreover, ablation studies show the benefit of contrastive learning with MIL.","Chikontwe, P.; Luna, M.; Kang, M.; Hong, K. S.; Ahn, J. H.; Park, S.

21213,Performance of intensive care unit severity scoring systems across different ethnicities.,"BackgroundDespite wide utilisation of severity scoring systems for case-mix determination and benchmarking in the intensive care unit, the possibility of scoring bias across ethnicities has not been examined. Recent guidelines on the use of illness severity scores to inform triage decisions for allocation of scarce resources such as mechanical ventilation during the current COVID-19 pandemic warrant examination for possible bias in these models. We investigated the performance of three severity scoring systems (APACHE IVa, OASIS, SOFA) across ethnic groups in two large ICU databases in order to identify possible ethnicity-based bias.

MethodData from the eICU Collaborative Research Database and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care were analysed for score performance in Asians, African Americans, Hispanics and Whites after appropriate exclusions. Discrimination and calibration were determined for all three scoring systems in all four groups.

FindingsWhile measurements of discrimination -area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) -were significantly different among the groups, they did not display any discernible systematic patterns of bias. In contrast, measurements of calibration -standardised mortality ratio (SMR) -indicated persistent, and in some cases significant, patterns of difference between Hispanics and African Americans versus Asians and Whites. The differences between African Americans and Whites were consistently statistically significant. While calibrations were imperfect for all groups, the scores consistently demonstrated a pattern of over-predicting mortality for African Americans and Hispanics.

InterpretationThe systematic differences in calibration across ethnic groups suggest that illness severity scores reflect bias in their predictions of mortality.

22770,Role of Heterogeneous Transmission in the Decline of COVID-19 Cases During Winter of 2020/2021 in Massachusetts,"ImportanceHeterogeneity in transmission of COVID-19 is a significant multiscale phenomenon. However, the role of this heterogeneity in shaping the overall dynamics of disease transmission is not well understood.

ObjectiveTo investigate the role of heterogeneous transmission among different towns in Massachusetts in shaping the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission, especially the recent decline during winter of 2020/2021.

Design, Setting, ParticipantsAnalysis of COVID-19 data collected and archived by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

ExposuresThe entire population of the state of Massachusetts is exposed to the virus responsible for COVID-19, to varying degrees. This study quantifies this variation.

Main outcome measuresWeekly observations, by town, on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Massachusetts, during the period (April 15th, 2020 to February 9th 2021).

ResultsThe relative decline in COVID-19 cases, during January 12th, 2021 to February 9th, 2021, in the group of towns with higher total accumulated cases in the period before January 12th, 2021 is significantly larger than the corresponding relative decline in the group of towns with lower accumulated cases during the same period.

Conclusions and RelevanceHeterogeneous nature of transmission is playing a significant role in shaping the rapid recent decline (January 12th to February 9th, 2021) in reported cases in Massachusetts, and probably around the country. These findings are relevant to how we estimate the threshold defining """"herd"""" immunity, suggesting that we should account for effects due to heterogeneity.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes heterogeneity in disease transmission play a role in shaping the overall dynamics of COVID-19 in Massachusetts, including the recent decline in cases during the 2020/2021 winter.

FindingsBased on analysis of data on cases in Massachusetts, the consistent and widespread decline of COVID-19 spread during winter of 2020/2021 (January 12th, 2021 to February 9th, 2021) appears to be shaped to a significant degree by the heterogeneous nature of transmission at the scale of different towns. Towns with a history of high (low) transmission rates during 2020 are experiencing a faster (slower) relative decline.

MeaningWe suggest that heterogeneity in transmission of COVID-19 may impact the dynamics of disease transmission including the emergence of """"herd"""" immunity, in line with some recent theoretical studies. This finding deserves some attention from other research groups investigating """"herd"""" immunity, and from federal and state public health authorities concerned with the future evolution of the pandemic.","Choi, Y.-W.; Castro, M.

20939,Immunochromatographic SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody assay: a cross-sectional study conducted at Wakayama Medical University in Japan,"Asymptomatic patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection must be quickly identified and isolated to prevent the spread of the virus. The number of asymptomatic healthy people is completely unknown because they remain untested. Detection of specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies has been widely accepted as a diagnostic test, and an immunochromatographic test, which is simpler and relatively cheaper than other methods, is becoming the gold standard for identifying healthy people who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the past. In this study, 1,528 volunteers who worked at a particular hospital were subjected to an immunochromatographic IgG test for SARS-CoV-2 to determine the ratio of asymptomatic people. Only 12 volunteers (0.79%) were IgG+, with no significant background differences in the sex, age, profession, experiences of working at the emergency department or caring for coronavirus disease 2019 patients. If this IgG+ ratio was to be extrapolated to Wakayama citys population, 2,780 out of 3,54,063 people may be asymptomatic for SARS-CoV-2. The results imply that anyone may get infected with SARS-CoV-2 but remain asymptomatic.","Iwabuchi, S.; Katsuda, M.; Koizumi, Y.; Hatai, M.; Kojima, M.; Tokudome, N.; Tamura, S.; Nishio, M.; Kondo, T.; Hironishi, M.; Kakutani, C.; Yamaue, H.; Hashimoto, S.",2021-01-13,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.01.10.21249421,1,Shinichi Hashimoto,"Department of Molecular Pathophysiology, Wakayama Medical University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.10.21249421v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.10.21249421v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
7223,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Luxembourgish population: the CON-VINCE study.,"BACKGROUNDThe World Health Organization declared the outbreak of coronavirus disease to be a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. The first SARS-CoV-2 infection was subsequently detected in Luxembourg on February 29, 2020. Representative population-based data, including asymptomatic individuals for assessing the viral spread and immune response was, however, lacking worldwide.

METHODSUsing a panel-based method, we recruited a representative sample of the Luxembourgish population based on age, gender and residency for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody status in order to define prevalence irrespective of clinical symptoms. Participants were contacted via email to fill an online questionnaire before biosampling at local laboratories. Participants provided information related to clinical symptoms, epidemiology, socioeconomic and psychological assessments and underwent biosampling, rRT-PCR testing and serology for SARS-CoV-2.

RESULTSA total of 1862 individuals were included for our representative sample of the general Luxembourgish population. We detected an ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection based on rRT-PCR in 5 participants. h Four of the SARS-CoV-2 infected participants were oligosymptomatic and one was asymptomatic. Overall, 35 participants (1.97%) had developed a positive IgG response, of whom 11 self-reported to have previously received a positive rRT-PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data indicate a prevalence of 0.3% for active SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Luxembourgish population between 18 and 79 years of age.

CONCLUSIONSLuxembourgish residents show a low rate of acute infections after 7 weeks of confinement and present with an antibody profile indicative of a more recent immune response to SARS-CoV-2. All infected individuals were oligo- or asymptomatic. Bi-weekly follow-up visits over the next 2 months will inform about the viral spread by oligo- and asymptomatic carriers and the individual changes in the immune profile.","Snoeck, C.

25688,COV-ID: A LAMP sequencing approach for high-throughput co-detection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus in human saliva,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for rapid, effective, and low-cost SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing. Here, we describe COV-ID, an approach that combines RT-LAMP with deep sequencing to detect SARS-CoV-2 in unprocessed human saliva with high sensitivity (5-10 virions). Based on a multi-dimensional barcoding strategy, COV-ID can be used to test thousands of samples overnight in a single sequencing run with limited labor and laboratory equipment. The sequencing-based readout allows COV-ID to detect multiple amplicons simultaneously, including key controls such as host transcripts and artificial spike-ins, as well as multiple pathogens. Here we demonstrate this flexibility by simultaneous detection of 4 amplicons in contrived saliva samples: SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, human STATHERIN, and an artificial SARS spike-in. The approach was validated on clinical saliva samples, where it showed 100% agreement with RT-qPCR. COV-ID can also be performed directly on saliva adsorbed on filter paper, simplifying collection logistics and sample handling.","Warneford-Thomson, R.; Shah, P.

23028,Synthetic protein antigens for COVID-19 diagnostics,"There is an urgent need for inexpensive, rapid and specific antigen-based assays to test for infection with SARS-CoV-2 and distinguish variants arising as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads. We have identified a small, synthetic protein (JS7), representing a region of maximum variability within the receptor binding domain (RBD), which binds antibodies in sera from nine patients with PCR-verified COVID-19 of varying severity. Antibodies binding to either JS7 or the SARS-CoV-2 recombinant RBD, as well as those that disrupt binding between a fragment of the ACE2 receptor and the RBD, are proportional to disease severity and clinical outcome. Binding to JS7 was inhibited by linear peptides from the RBD interface with ACE2. Variants of JS7, such as N501Y, can be quickly synthesized in a pure form in large quantities by automated methods. JS7 and related synthetic antigens can provide a basis for specific diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Schein, C. H.; Mcclellan, S. F.; Levine, C. B.; Negi, S.

1836,Simulating and Forecasting the Cumulative Confirmed Cases of SARS-CoV-2 in China by Boltzmann Function-based Regression Analyses,"An ongoing outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is hitting Wuhan City and has spread to other provinces/cities of China and overseas. It very urgent to forecast the future course of the outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the potential total number of confirmed cases in mainland China by applying Boltzmann-function based regression analyses. We found that the cumulative number of confirmed cases from Jan 21 to Feb 14, 2020 for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City and other provinces were all well fitted with the Boltzmann function (R2 being close to 0.999). The potential total number of confirmed cases in the above geographic regions were estimated at 95% confidence interval (CI) as 79589 (71576, 93855), 64817 (58223, 77895), 46562 (40812, 57678) and 13956 (12748, 16092), respectively. Notably, our results suggest that the number of daily new confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in mainland China (including Hubei Province) will become minimal between Feb 28 and Mar 10, 2020, with 95% CI. In addition, we found that the data of cumulative confirmed cases of 2003 SARS-CoV in China and Worldwide were also well fitted to the Boltzmann function. To our knowledge this is the first study revealing that the Boltzmann function is suitable to simulate epidemics. The estimated potential total number of confirmed cases and key dates for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak may provide certain guidance for governments, organizations and citizens to optimize preparedness and response efforts.","Fu, X.; Ying, Q.; Zeng, T.; Long, T.; Wang, Y.",2020-02-20,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.02.16.20023564,2,Xinmiao Fu,Fujian Normal University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023564v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023564v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.019

We compared the analytical performance of a laboratory developed test (LDT) developed in our clinical laboratory based on CDC primer sets and four commercially available, FDA emergency use authorized assays for SARS-CoV-2 (Cepheid, DiaSorin, Hologic Panther, and Roche Cobas) on a total of 169 nasopharyngeal swabs. The LDT and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assays were the most sensitive assays for SARS-CoV-2 with 100% agreement across specimens. The Hologic Panther Fusion, DiaSorin Simplexa, and Roche Cobas 6800 only failed to detect positive specimens near the limit of detection of our CDC-based LDT assay. All assays were 100% specific, using our CDC-based LDT as the gold standard.

DesignPublicly available UK government data is used to determine a relationship between reported cases and deaths, taking into account various UK regions, age profiles and prevalence of the variant of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7.

Main Outcome MeasuresEstablishing a simple statistical relationship between detected cases and subsequent mortality.

ResultsThroughout October and November 2020, deaths in England are well described as 1/55th of detected cases from 12 days previously. After that, the relationship no longer holds and deaths are significantly higher. This is especially true in regions affected by the VOC B.1.1.7

ConclusionsIn early December, some new factor emerged to increase the case-fatality rate in the UK.

Summary BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSThe infection-mortality ratio enables one to predict future deaths based on current infections. Incomplete monitoring of infection may be sufficient to predict future trends.

What the study addsFor the specific case of the second wave of coronavirus infection in the UK, we show a clear mathematical relationship between detected infections (positive tests) and subsequent deaths. This relationship begins to fail in December, with unexpectedly high death rates. This may be correlated in time and region with the emergence of the Variant of Concern B 1.1.7.","Wallace, D.

3704,Flattening the curve before it flattens us: hospital critical care capacity limits and mortality from novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) cases in US counties,"BackgroundAs of March 26, 2020, the United States had the highest number of confirmed cases of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) of any country in the world. Hospital critical care is perhaps the most important medical system choke point in terms of preventing deaths in a disaster scenario such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. We therefore brought together previously established disease modeling estimates of the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic in the US under various social distancing contact reduction assumptions, with local estimates of the potential critical care surge response across all US counties.

MethodsEstimates of spatio-temporal COVID-19 demand and medical system critical care supply were calculated for all continental US counties. These estimates were statistically summarized and mapped for US counties, regions and urban versus non-urban areas. Estimates of COVID-19 infections and patients needing critical care were calculated from March 24, 2020 to April 24, 2020 for three different estimated population levels - 0%, 25%, and 50% - of contact reduction (through actions such as social distancing). Multiple national public and private datasets were linked and harmonized in order to calculate county-level critical care bed counts that included currently available beds and those that could be made available under four surge response scenarios - very low, low, medium, and high - as well as excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care.

ResultsSurge response scenarios ranged from a very low total supply 77,588 critical care beds to a high total of 278,850 critical care beds. Over the four week study period, excess deaths from inaccessible critical care ranged from 24,688 in the very low response scenario to 13,268 in the high response scenario. Northeastern and urban counties were projected to be most affected by excess deaths due to critical care shortages, and counties in New York, Colorado, and Virginia were projected to exceed their critical care bed limits despite high levels of COVID-19 contact reduction. Over the four week study period, an estimated 12,203-19,594 excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care could be averted through greater preventive actions such as travel restrictions, publicly imposed contact precautions, greater availability of rapid testing for COVID-19, social distancing, self-isolation when sick, and similar interventions. An estimated 4,029-11,420 excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care could be averted through aggressive critical care surge response and preparations, including high clearance of ICU and non-ICU critical care beds and extraordinary measures like using a single ventilator for multiple patients.

ConclusionsUnless the epidemic curve of COVID-19 cases is flattened over an extended period of time, the US COVID-19 epidemic will cause a shortage of critical care beds and drive up otherwise preventable deaths. The findings here support value of preventive actions to flatten the epidemic curve, as well as the value of exercising extraordinary surge capacity measures to increase access to hospital critical care for severely ill COVID-19 patients.","Branas, C.

7098,Evaluating the determinants of COVID-19 mortality: A cross-country study,"As the COVID-19 pandemic has spread to the entire world, a race to understand the virus and to find an effective and safe vaccine or treatment has triggered interest in the factors contributing to mortality. For instance, some studies have suggested that the BCG vaccine could protect from COVID-19 and nicotine patches could be therapeutic against the virus. This study makes use of data for about 140 countries to evaluate the determinants of COVID-19 mortality. It finds that a countrys share of spending on health care (as a measure of a countrys effectiveness in tracking, recording, and reporting COVID-19 deaths) is positively associated with COVID-19 deaths. It also finds that the share of people above 65 years of age, obesity, and urbanization are all positively associated with COVID-19 mortality. There is no evidence that BCG vaccination, smoking prevalence, and PM25 pollution have any link to COVID-19 mortality. These estimation results are robust to alternative specifications and after controlling for confounding factors and excluding outliers. Policymakers should allocate resources towards the protection of the elderly and those suffering from underlying conditions such as obesity. They should also exercise caution about administering nicotine patches or the BCG vaccine to fight COVID-19 without the backing of concrete scientific evidence.","Squalli, J.",2020-05-17,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.05.12.20099093,1,Jay Squalli,American University of Sharjah,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20099093v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20099093v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
19760,Risk-driven responses to COVID-19 eliminate the tradeoff between lives and livelihoods,"Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have been conditioned by a perceived tradeoff between saving lives and the economic costs of contact-reduction measures. We develop a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission where populations endogenously reduce contacts in response to the risk of death. We estimate the model for 118 countries and assess the existence of a tradeoff between death rates and changes in contacts. In this model communities go through three phases - rapid early outbreaks, control through initial response, and a longer period of quasi-equilibrium endemic infection with effective reproduction number (Re) fluctuating around one. Analytical characterization of this phase shows little tradeoff between contact reduction levels (underpinning economic costs) and death rates. Empirically estimating the model, we find no positive correlation between (log) death rates and (normalized) contact levels across nations, whether contacts are estimated based on epidemic curves or mobility data. While contact reduction levels are broadly similar across countries, expected death rates vary greatly, by two orders of magnitude (5-95 percentile: 0.03-17 deaths per million per day). Results suggest nations could significantly reduce the human toll of the pandemic without more disruption to normal social and economic activity than they have already faced.

Executive SummaryO_LIProblem specification: The response to COVID-19 pandemic is dominated by a perceived tradeoff between saving lives through cutting social interactions vs. allowing those interactions to maintain economic livelihood of communities. It is, however, unclear if this tradeoff really exists.
C_LIO_LIPractitioner audience: Local, regional, and national policy makers who control communities responses to observed levels of COVID-19 transmission risk are grappling with this perceived tradeoff on a daily basis.
C_LIO_LICore insight: The perceived tradeoff is illusory. Every community will pay a similar price in contact reduction. What communities do control is the level of infection and deaths at which they are willing to bring down contacts enough to keep the epidemic from growing further.
C_LIO_LIPractical implications: By becoming more responsive, effective leaders quickly bring down communitys interactions in response to small numbers of cases and deaths. They can then maintain these small case counts at social interaction levels similar to other communities that experience much larger ongoing cases. Thus, there is a path to saving lives at limited excess costs.

18194,Secondary Household Covid-19 Transmission Modelling of Students Returning Home from University,"We estimate the number of secondary Covid-19 infections caused by potentially infectious students returning from university to private homes with other occupants. Using a Monte-Carlo method and data derived from UK sources, we predict that an infectious student would, on average, infect 0.94 other household members. Or, as a rule of thumb, each infected student would generate (just less than) one secondary within-household infection. The total number of secondary cases for all returning students is dependent on the virus prevalence within the student population at the time of their departure from campus back home. Correspondingly, we provide results for prevalence ranging from 0.5% to 15%, which is based on observed minimum and maximum estimates from Cardiff Universitys asymptomatic testing service. Although the proposed estimation method is general and robust, the results are sensitive to the input data. We therefore provide Matlab code and a helpful online app (http://bit.ly/Secondary_infections_app) that can be used to estimate numbers of secondary infections based on local parameter values.","Harper, P.

18256,An Early Assessment of Curfew and Second COVID-19 Lock-down on Virus Propagation in France,"This note provides an early assessment of the reinforced measures to curb the COVID-19 pandemic in France, which include a curfew of selected areas and culminate in a second COVID-19-related lock-down that started on October 30, 2020 and is still ongoing. We analyse the change in virus propagation across age groups and across departements using an acceleration index introduced in Baunez et al. (2020). We find that while the pandemic is still in the acceleration regime, acceleration decreased notably with curfew measures and this more rapidly so for the more vulnerable population group, that is, for people older than 60. Acceleration continued to decline under lock-down, but more so for the active population under 60 than for those above 60. For the youngest population aged 0 to 19, curfew measures did not reduce acceleration but lock-down does. This suggests that if health policies aim at protecting the elderly population generally more at risk to suffer severe consequences from COVID-19, curfew measures may be effective enough. However, looking at the departmental map of France, we find that curfews have not necessarily been imposed in departements where acceleration was the largest.

20727,Optimal design for phase 2 studies of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs,"There is no agreed methodology for pharmacometric assessment of candidate SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs. The most widely used measure of virological response in clinical trials to date is the time to viral clearance assessed by serial qPCR. We posited that rate of viral clearance would have better discriminatory value. Using a pharmacodynamic model fit to individual SARS-CoV-2 qPCR data from 46 prospectively followed uncomplicated COVID-19 infections, we simulated viral load data and showed that rate of viral clearance is a uniformly superior endpoint as compared to time to clearance with respect to type 2 error. Rate of clearance is not dependent on initial viral load or assay sensitivity. We apply our approach to data from a randomised controlled trial of ivermectin. Pharmacometric antiviral assessments should be conducted in early illness with serial qPCR samples taken over one week. Response-adaptive trials using rate of clearance can identify promising antiviral interventions rapidly.","Watson, J. A.; Kissler, S.; Day, N. P.; Grad, Y. H.; White, N.

21699,Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccination strategies with a delayed second dose,"Two of the COVID-19 vaccines currently approved in the United States require two doses, administered three to four weeks apart. Constraints in vaccine supply and distribution capacity, together with a deadly wave of COVID-19 from November 2020 to January 2021 and the emergence of highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 variants, sparked a policy debate on whether to vaccinate more individuals with the first dose of available vaccines and delay the second dose, or to continue with the recommended two-dose series as tested in clinical trials. We developed an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission to compare the impact of these two vaccination strategies, while varying the temporal waning of vaccine efficacy following the first dose and the level of pre-existing immunity in the population. Our results show that for Moderna vaccines, a delay of at least 9 weeks could maximize vaccination program effectiveness and avert at least an additional 17.3 (95% CrI: 7.8 - 29.7) infections, 0.71 (95% CrI: 0.52 - 0.97) hospitalizations, and 0.34 (95% CrI: 0.25 - 0.44) deaths per 10,000 population compared to the recommended 4-week interval between the two doses. Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines also averted an additional 0.61 (95% CrI: 0.37 - 0.89) hospitalizations and 0.31 (95% CrI: 0.23 - 0.45) deaths per 10,000 population in a 9-week delayed second dose strategy compared to the 3-week recommended schedule between doses. However, there was no clear advantage of delaying the second dose with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in reducing infections, unless the efficacy of the first dose did not wane over time. Our findings underscore the importance of quantifying the characteristics and durability of vaccine-induced protection after the first dose in order to determine the optimal time interval between the two doses.","Moghadas, S.

10105,"Chloroquine, but not hydroxychlorquine, prolongs the QT interval in a primary care population","BackgroundChloroquine (CQ) and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have recently been suggested as treatment for the current Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, despite their long-term use and only few case reports on adverse effects, CQ and HCQ are listed as a known risk of the lethal ventricular arrhythmia Torsade de Pointes and their cardiac safety profile is being questioned. Thus, we aimed to investigate the electrocardiographic and mortality effects of CQ and HCQ in a primary care population.

MethodsWe used Danish health care registers and electrocardiograms (ECGs) from primary care to define three studies. 1) A paired study of subjects with ECGs before and during use of CQ/HCQ, 2) a matched ECG study of subjects taking CQ/HCQ compared to controls, and 3) a mortality study on people taking HCQ matched to control. In both matched studies, we adjusted for connective tissue diseases, use of QT-prolonging drugs, and cardiac disease. We used the QTc interval as the marker for electrocardiographic safety. In the mortality study, cases were followed from first claimed prescription until 300 days after estimated completion of the last prescription. 95% confidence intervals follow estimates in parenthesis.

ResultsUse of CQ was associated with a 5.5 (0.7;10) ms increase in QTc in the paired study (n=10). In the matched study (n=28, controls=280), QTc was insignificantly increased in subjects taking CQ by 4.7 (-3.4;13) ms. With a {Delta}QTc of 1.0 (-5.6;7.5), use of HCQ was not associated with an increased QTc in the paired study (n=32). In the matched study (n=172, controls=1,720), QTc also was not different between groups (p=0.5). In the mortality study (n=3,368), use of HCQ was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.67 (0.43;1.05).

ConclusionsIn subjects free of COVID-19, we found a small increase in QTc associated with use of chloroquine, but not hydroxychloroquine. We found no increased mortality associated with use of hydroxychloroquine.","Isaksen, J. L.; Holst, A. G.; Pietersen, A.; Nielsen, J. B.; Graff, C.; Kanters, J.

22307,Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in the Bronx enables clinical and epidemiological inference,"The Bronx was an early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA. We conducted temporal genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 genomes across the Bronx from March-October 2020. Although the local structure of SARS-CoV-2 lineages mirrored those of New York City and New York State, temporal sampling revealed a dynamic and changing landscape of SARS- CoV-2 genomic diversity. Mapping the trajectories of variants, we found that while some have become 'endemic' to the Bronx, other, novel variants rose in prevalence in the late summer/early fall. Geographically resolved genomes enabled us to distinguish between a case of reinfection and a case of persistent infection. We propose that limited, targeted, temporal genomic surveillance has clinical and epidemiological utility in managing the ongoing COVID pandemic.","Fels, J. M.; Khan, S.; Forster, R.; Skalina, K.

10690,Aligning SARS-CoV-2 Indicators via an Epidemic Model: Application to Hospital Admissions and RNA Detection in Sewage Sludge,"Ascertaining the state of coronavirus outbreaks is crucial for public health decision-making. Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the population, public health officials and researchers alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model. The results demonstrate that both data series plausibly follow from the transmission model specified, provide a direct estimate of the reproductive number R0 = 2.38, and suggest that the detection of viral RNA in sewage sludge leads hospital admissions by 4.6 days on average.","Kaplan, E.

10741,Epidemic Trend Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in SAARC Countries Using Modified SIR (M-SIR) Predictive Model,"A novel coronavirus causing the severe and fatal respiratory syndrome was identified in China, is now producing outbreaks in more than two hundred countries around the world, and became pandemic by the time. In this article, a modified version of the well known mathematical epidemic model Susceptible (S)- Infected (I)- Recovered (R) is used to analyze the epidemics course of COVID-19 in eight different countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). To achieve this goal, the parameters of the SIR model are identified by using publicly available data for the corresponding countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Based on the prediction model we estimated the epidemic trend of COVID-19 outbreak in SAARC countries for 20 days, 90 days, and 180 days respectively. An SML (short-mid-long) term prediction model has been designed to understand the early dynamics of COVID-19 Epidemic in the south-east Asian region. The maximum and minimum basic reproduction number (R0 = 1.33 and 1.07) for SAARC countries are predicted to be in Pakistan and Bhutan. We equate simulation results with real data in the SAARC countries on the COVID-19 outbreak, and model potential countermeasure implementation scenarios. Our results should provide policymakers with a method for evaluating the impacts of possible interventions, including lockdown and social distancing, as well as testing and contact tracking.","Dey, S.

7326,Is the Current N95 Respirator Filtration Efficiency Test Sufficient for Evaluating Protection Against Submicrometer Particles Containing SARS-CoV-2?,"The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health procedure No. TEB-APR-STP-0059 recommend of measuring the respirator filtration efficiency using sodium chloride aerosol with count median diameter of 75 nm {+/-} 20 nm and geometric standard deviation [&le;]1.86. This study showed that this method would overestimate the respirators ability to protect against submicrometer particles. In this study, we converted both mobility diameter and equivalent volume diameter to aerodynamic diameter for comparison. The results showed that one unqualified KN95 respirator (with the filtration efficiency of 72%{+/-}3% for [&ge;]300 nm sodium chloride aerosol) still passed the test with a measured overall filtration efficiency of 98%{+/-}3%, due to its larger most penetrating particle size compared to the typical N95 respirator. In addition, after three cycle H2O2 plasma vaporous sterilizations, the most penetrating particle size for the N95 grade respirators also shifted to 250 nm - 500 nm, in which size the particles carried the peak concentration of the SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals. This size shift caused the significant difference between the size specific (250 nm - 500 nm) filtration efficiency and overall filtration efficiency using the same NaCl test aerosol. For example, after three cycle H2O2 plasma vaporous sterilizations, the size specific filtration efficiency of the N95 was 55%{+/-}2%, however, the measured overall filtration efficiency was still 86%{+/-}5%. The size Specific filtration efficiency of the KN95 was 69%{+/-}2%, but, the measured overall filtration efficiency was still 90%{+/-}3%. In order to protect health care personnel adequately, we recommend increasing the test aerosol size, and measuring the size specific filtration efficiency to evaluate the N95 alternatives (e.g. KN95), and the reuse of N95 level respirators. In addition, multi-cycle sterilization with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation appears to have fewer negative effects than H2O2.","Cai, C.; Floyd, E. L.; Aithinne, K.

21771,Prediction Models for Severe Manifestations and Mortality due to COVID-19: A Rapid Systematic Review,"BackgroundThroughout 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a threat to public health on national and global level. There has been an immediate need for research to understand the clinical signs and symptoms of COVID-19 that can help predict deterioration including mechanical ventilation, organ support, and death. Studies thus far have addressed the epidemiology of the disease, common presentations, and susceptibility to acquisition and transmission of the virus; however, an accurate prognostic model for severe manifestations of COVID-19 is still needed because of the limited healthcare resources available.

ObjectiveThis systematic review aims to evaluate published reports of prediction models for severe illnesses caused COVID-19.

MethodsSearches were developed by the primary author and a medical librarian using an iterative process of gathering and evaluating terms. Comprehensive strategies, including both index and keyword methods, were devised for PubMed and EMBASE. The data of confirmed COVID-19 patients from randomized control studies, cohort studies, and case-control studies published between January 2020 and July 2020 were retrieved. Studies were independently assessed for risk of bias and applicability using the Prediction Model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). We collected study type, setting, sample size, type of validation, and outcome including intubation, ventilation, any other type of organ support, or death. The combination of the prediction model, scoring system, performance of predictive models, and geographic locations were summarized.

ResultsA primary review found 292 articles relevant based on title and abstract. After further review, 246 were excluded based on the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Forty-six articles were included in the qualitative analysis. Inter observer agreement on inclusion was 0.86 (95% confidence interval: 0.79 - 0.93). When the PROBAST tool was applied, 44 of the 46 articles were identified to have high or unclear risk of bias, or high or unclear concern for applicability. Two studied reported prediction models, 4C Mortality Score from hospital data and QCOVID from general public data from UK, and were rated as low risk of bias and low concerns for applicability.

ConclusionSeveral prognostic models are reported in the literature, but many of them had concerning risks of biases and applicability. For most of the studies, caution is needed before use, as many of them will require external validation before dissemination. However, two articles were found to have low risk of bias and low applicability can be useful tools.","Miller, J.; Tada, M.; Goto, M.; Mohr, N.

3533,Knowledge and Beliefs towards Universal Safety Precautions to flatten the curve during Novel Coronavirus Disease (nCOVID-19) Pandemic among general Public in India: Explorations from a National Perspective,"BackgroundThe novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is being considered as the most serious health threat that the world has never witnessed in the recent times and significantly affecting the daily routine of mankind by emerging as a global pandemic. Yet, as there is no treatment nor a vaccine that was approved so far, universal safety precautions (USPs) and mitigating strategies are the only way to deal with this emergency crisis. However, knowledge and beliefs towards USPs among the general public in countries such as India with a large population are lacking.

MethodsA prospective, cross-sectional, web-based online survey was conducted among the general public in India during March 2020. A 20-item self-administered survey questionnaire was developed and randomly distributed among the public using google document forms through social media networks. Descriptive statistics were used in representing the study characteristics, and the Chi-square test was used in assessing the associations among the study variables with a p-value of < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

ResultsOf 1287 participants, 1117 have given their consent of willingness and completed the questionnaire with a response rate of 86.8%. The mean age of the study participants was 28.8 {+/-} 10.9 years, where the majority of them belong to the age category <25 years, and sex was equally distributed. Based upon the socio-demographic information, the majority were post-graduates (32.9%), professional job holders (45%) and belonged to the upper-middle (40%) economic class. Overall, the knowledge and beliefs towards USPs and mitigating strategies among participants varied between moderate to high, with statistically significant associations with their socio-demographic characteristics.

ConclusionsAlthough the knowledge and beliefs of the general public in India towards USPs are encouraging, there is a need for long-term educational interventions as the dynamics and severity of COVID-19 have been changing day-by-day rapidly. The findings of this study could guide the public health authorities in making and implementing decisions to combat this pandemic.","Gudi, S. K.; Undela, K.; Venkataraman, R.; Mateti, U.

8503,Monitoring the post-containment COVID-19 crisis in Guadeloupe: Early-warning signals of destabilisation through bootstrapped probability density functions,"We propose a method to detect early-warning information in relation with subtle changes occurring in the trend of evolution in data time series of the COVID-19 epidemic spread (e.g. daily new cases). The method is simple and easy to implement on laptop computers. It is designed to be able to provide reliable results even with very small amounts of data (i.e. {approx} 10 - 20). The results are given as compact graphics easy to interpret. The data are separated into two subsets: the old data used as control points to statistically define a """"trend"""" and the recent data that are tested to evaluate their conformity with this trend. The trend is characterised by bootstrapping in order to obtain probability density functions of the expected misfit of each data point. The probability densities are used to compute distance matrices where data clusters and outliers are easily visually recognised. In addition to be able to detect very subtle changes in trend, the method is also able to detect outliers. A simulated case is analysed where R0 is slowly augmented (i.e. from 1.5 to 2.0 in 20 days) to pass from a stable damped control of the epidemic spread to an exponentially diverging situation. The method is able to give an early warning signal as soon as the very beginning of the R0 variation. Application to the data of Guadeloupe shows that a small destabilising event occurred in the data near April 30, 2020. This may be due to an increase of R0 0.7 around April 13-15, 2020.","Allali, M.; Portecop, P.; Carles, M.; Gibert, D.",2020-05-30,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.29.20117333,1,Meriem Allali,CHU POINTE-A-PITRE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.29.20117333v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.29.20117333v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
10784,Social Distancing Causally Impacts the Spread of SARS-CoV-2: A U.S. Nationwide Event Study,"BackgroundTo date, no study has examined the effectiveness of social distancing, while controlling for social mobility and social distancing restrictions in the United States. We utilize the quasi-experimental setting created by the nationwide protests precipitated by George Floyds tragic death on May 25, 2020, to assess the causal impact of social distancing on the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsOur sample period spans from January 22, 2020, to June 20, 2020, and consists of 474,422 county-days representing 3,142 counties from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. To assess the change in COVID-19 case counts following the protests, we employ a differences-in-differences estimation strategy in a multivariate setting, in which we control for social distancing restrictions and social mobility across counties. We also control for covariates that may influence SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and implement placebo tests using a Monte Carlo simulation.

FindingsWe document a country-wide increase of over 3{middle dot}06 cases per day, per 100,000 population, following the onset of the protests (95%CI: 2{middle dot}47-3{middle dot}65), and a further increase of 1{middle dot}73 cases per day, per 100,000 population, in the counties in which the protests took place (95%CI: 0{middle dot}59-2{middle dot}87). Relative to the week preceding the onset of the protests, this represents a 61{middle dot}2% country-wide increase in COVID-19 cases, and a further 34{middle dot}6% increase in the protest counties.

InterpretationOur study documents a significant increase in COVID-19 case counts in counties that experienced a protest, and we conclude that social distancing practices causally impact the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The observed effect cannot be explained by changes in social distancing restrictions and social mobility, and placebo tests rule out the possibility that this finding is attributable to chance.

16086,Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in Brazil using digital technology,"BackgroundBrazil has the third-highest number of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases worldwide. Understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 from reported cases is challenging due to heterogeneous testing rates. We estimated the number of COVID-19 cases in Brazil on a national and regional level using digital technology.

MethodsWe used a web-based application to perform a population-based survey from March 21st to August 29th, 2020 in Brazil. We obtained responses from 243 461 individuals across all federative units, who answered questions on COVID-19-related symptoms, chronic diseases and address of residence. COVID-19 was defined as at least one of the following: fever, cough, dyspnea and nasal flaring, associated with a history of close contact with a suspect or confirmed COVID-19 case in the previous 14 days. A stratified two-stage weighted survey analysis was performed to estimate the population level prevalence of COVID-19 cases.

ResultsAfter calibration weighing, we estimated that 10 339 461 cases of COVID-19 occurred, yielding a 2.75 estimated infection per officially reported case. Estimated/reported ratios varied across Brazilian states and were higher in states with lower human development indexes. Areas with lower income levels displayed higher rates of COVID-19 cases (66 vs 38 cases/1000 people in the lowest and highest income strata respectively, p<0.001), but presented lower rates of COVID-19 testing.

ConclusionIn this population-based survey using digital technology in Brazil, we estimated that the COVID-19 case rates were 2.75 times higher than officially reported. The estimated per reported case ratios were higher in areas with worse socioeconomic status.","Hajar, F. N.; Fernandes-Silva, M. M.; Pereira Da Cunha, G. S.; Herrera, G.; Hamud, A.; Azevedo, V.

23516,Persistence of symptoms up to 10 months following acute COVID-19 illness,"ImportanceCOVID-19 symptoms are increasingly recognized to persist among a subset of individual following acute infection, but features associated with this persistence are not well-understood.

ObjectiveWe aimed to identify individual features that predicted persistence of symptoms over at least 2 months at the time of survey completion.

Design: Non-probability internet survey. Participants were asked to identify features of acute illness as well as persistence of symptoms at time of study completion. We used logistic regression models to examine association between sociodemographic and clinical features and persistence of symptoms at or beyond 2 months.

SettingTen waves of a fifty-state survey between June 13, 2020 and January 13, 2021.

Participants6,211 individuals who reported symptomatic COVID-19 illness confirmed by positive test or clinician diagnosis.

Exposuresymptomatic COVID-19 illness

ResultsAmong 6,211 survey respondents reporting COVID-19 illness, with a mean age of 37.8 (SD 12.2) years and 45.1% female, 73.9% white, 10.0% Black, 9.9% Hispanic, and 3.1% Asian, a total of 4946 (79.6%) had recovered within less than 2 months, while 491 (7.9%) experienced symptoms for 2 months or more. Of the full cohort, 3.4% were symptomatic for 4 months or more and 2.2% for 6 months or more. In univariate analyses, individuals with persistent symptoms on average reported greater initial severity. In logistic regression models, older age was associated with greater risk of persistence (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.19 for each decade beyond 40); otherwise, no significant associations with persistence were identified for gender, race/ethnicity, or income. Presence of headache was significantly associated with greater likelihood of persistence (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.11-1.86), while fever was associated with diminished likelihood of persistence (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.53-0.83).

Conclusion and RelevanceA subset of individuals experience persistent symptoms from 2 to more than 10 months after acute COVID-19 illness, particularly those who recall headache and absence of fever. In light of this prevalence, strategies for predicting and managing such sequelae are needed.

4330,Bayesian Adaptive Clinical Trials for Anti-Infective Therapeutics during Epidemic Outbreaks,"In the midst of epidemics such as COVID-19, therapeutic candidates are unlikely to be able to complete the usual multi-year clinical trial and regulatory approval process within the course of an outbreak. We apply a Bayesian adaptive patient-centered model--which minimizes the expected harm of false positives and false negatives--to optimize the clinical trial development path during such outbreaks. When the epidemic is more infectious and fatal, the Bayesian-optimal sample size in the clinical trial is lower and the optimal statistical significance level is higher. For COVID-19 (assuming a static R0 = 2 and initial infection percentage of 0.1%), the optimal significance level is 7.1% for a clinical trial of a non-vaccine anti-infective therapeutic clinical trial and 13.6% for that of a vaccine. For a dynamic R0 ranging from 2 to 4, the corresponding values are 14.4% and 26.4%, respectively. Our results illustrate the importance of adapting the clinical trial design and the regulatory approval process to the specific parameters and stage of the epidemic.","Xu, Q.; Chaudhuri, S.; Xiao, D.; Lo, A.

4659,"Suppression of COVID-19 outbreak in the municipality of Vo, Italy","On the 21st of February 2020 a resident of the municipality of Vo, a small town near Padua, died of pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection1. This was the first COVID-19 death detected in Italy since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei province2. In response, the regional authorities imposed the lockdown of the whole municipality for 14 days3. We collected information on the demography, clinical presentation, hospitalization, contact network and presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasopharyngeal swabs for 85.9% and 71.5% of the population of Vo at two consecutive time points. On the first survey, which was conducted around the time the town lockdown started, we found a prevalence of infection of 2.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-3.3%). On the second survey, which was conducted at the end of the lockdown, we found a prevalence of 1.2% (95% CI 0.8-1.8%). Notably, 43.2% (95% CI 32.2-54.7%) of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections detected across the two surveys were asymptomatic. The mean serial interval was 6.9 days (95% CI 2.6-13.4). We found no statistically significant difference in the viral load (as measured by genome equivalents inferred from cycle threshold data) of symptomatic versus asymptomatic infections (p-values 0.6 and 0.2 for E and RdRp genes, respectively, Exact Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test). Contact tracing of the newly infected cases and transmission chain reconstruction revealed that most new infections in the second survey were infected in the community before the lockdown or from asymptomatic infections living in the same household. This study sheds new light on the frequency of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and their infectivity (as measured by the viral load) and provides new insights into its transmission dynamics, the duration of viral load detectability and the efficacy of the implemented control measures.","Lavezzo, E.; Franchin, E.; Ciavarella, C.; Cuomo-Dannenburg, G.; Barzon, L.; Del Vecchio, C.; Rossi, L.; Manganelli, R.; Loregian, A.; Navarin, N.; Abate, D.; Sciro, M.; Merigliano, S.; Decanale, E.; Vanuzzo, M.

6243,COVID-19 Pandemic Prediction for Hungary; a Hybrid Machine Learning Approach,"Several epidemiological models are being used around the world to project the number of infected individuals and the mortality rates of the COVID-19 outbreak. Advancing accurate prediction models is of utmost importance to take proper actions. Due to a high level of uncertainty or even lack of essential data, the standard epidemiological models have been challenged regarding the delivery of higher accuracy for long-term prediction. As an alternative to the susceptible-infected-resistant (SIR)-based models, this study proposes a hybrid machine learning approach to predict the COVID-19 and we exemplify its potential using data from Hungary. The hybrid machine learning methods of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multi-layered perceptron-imperialist competitive algorithm (MLP-ICA) are used to predict time series of infected individuals and mortality rate. The models predict that by late May, the outbreak and the total morality will drop substantially. The validation is performed for nine days with promising results, which confirms the model accuracy. It is expected that the model maintains its accuracy as long as no significant interruption occurs. Based on the results reported here, and due to the complex nature of the COVID-19 outbreak and variation in its behavior from nation-to-nation, this study suggests machine learning as an effective tool to model the outbreak. This paper provides an initial benchmarking to demonstrate the potential of machine learning for future research.","Pinter, G.; Felde, I.; Mosavi, A.; Ghamisi, P.; Gloaguen, R.",2020-05-06,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.05.02.20088427,1,Amir Mosavi,Obuda University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.02.20088427v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.02.20088427v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.3390/math8060890
17595,A rapid systematic review of measures to protect older people in long term care facilities from COVID-19,"The global COVID-19 pandemic produced large-scale health and economic complications. Older people and those with comorbidities are particularly vulnerable to this virus, with nursing homes and long term care facilities experiencing significant morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 outbreaks. The aim of this rapid systematic review was to investigate measures implemented in long term care facilities to reduce transmission of COVID-19 and their effect on morbidity and mortality of residents, staff, and visitors. Databases (including MedRXiv pre-published repository) were systematically searched to identify studies reporting assessment of interventions to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in nursing homes among residents, staff, or visitors. Outcome measures include facility characteristics, morbidity data, case fatalities, and transmission rates. Due to study quality and heterogeneity, no meta-analysis was conducted. The search yielded 1414 articles, with 38 studies included. Reported interventions include mass testing, use of personal protective equipment, symptom screening, visitor restrictions, hand hygiene and droplet/contact precautions, and resident cohorting. Prevalence rates ranged from 1.2-85.4% in residents and 0.6-62.6% in staff. Mortality rates ranged from 5.3-55.3% in residents. Novel evidence in this review details the impact of facility size, availability of staff and practices of operating between multiple facilities, and for-profit status of facilities as factors contributing to the size and number of COVID-19 outbreaks. No causative relationships can be determined; however, this review provides evidence of interventions that reduce transmission of COVID-19 in long term care facilities.","Frazer, K.; Mitchell, L.; Stokes, D.; Lacey, E.; Crowley, E.; Kelleher, C.

17312,Efficacy of Convalescent Plasma Therapy compared to Fresh Frozen Plasma in Severely ill COVID-19 Patients: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,"BackgroundThe role of convalescent plasma (COPLA) for the treatment of severely ill Corona Virus Disease-2019 is under investigation. We compared the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in severe COVID-19 patients.

Methods and findingsThis was an open-label, single-centre phase II RCT on 29 patients with severe COVID-19 from India. One group received COPLA with standard medical care (SMC) (n=14), and another group received FFP with SMC (n=15). A total of 29 patients were randomized in the two treatment groups. Eleven out of 14 (78.5%) patients remained free of ventilation at day seven in the intervention arm while the proportion was 14 out of 15 (93.3 %) in the control arm (p= 0.258). The median reductions in RR per min at 48-hours in COPLA-group and FFP group were -6.5 and -3 respectively [p=0.004] and at day seven were -14.5 and -10 respectively (p=0.008). The median improvements in percentage O2 saturation at 48-hours were 6.5 and 2 respectively [p=0.001] and at day seven were 10 and 7.5 respectively (p=0.026). In the COPLA-group, the median improvement in PaO2/FiO2 was significantly superior to FFP at 48-hours [41.94 and 231.15, p=0.009], and also at day-7 [5.55 and 77.01 p<0.001]. We did not find significant differences in hospitalization duration between the groups (0.08).

ConclusionCOPLA therapy resulted in rapid improvement in respiratory parameters and shortened time to clinical recovery, although no significant reduction in mortality was observed in this pilot trial. We need larger trials to draw conclusive evidence on the use of Convalescent plasma in COVID-19.

28034,"The Knowledge and Attitude of Physicians Regarding Vaccinations in Yerevan, Armenia: Challenges for COVID-19","BackgroundThis primary-data analysis investigates the current level of awareness and medical knowledge of physicians in 20 health facilities in Yerevan, Armenia regarding vaccination - specifically with regard to HPV infection and the recently-introduced Gardasil vaccine used against HPV infection - that may have implications for successful roll-outs of national programmes for new vaccines, including those for COVID-19.

MethodsA questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was completed by 348 physicians who met the study inclusion criteria, from 20 out of 36 randomly selected healthcare facilities in Yerevan, Armenia, between Dec 2017 to Sep 2018. The aim of the questionnaire was to identify physicians awareness of and attitudes to HPV-related cervical cancer and the Gardasil vaccine. Responses were analysed using SPSS software (Version 16).

ResultsThe responding physicians displayed a respectable level of knowledge and awareness regarding vaccination with regard to some characteristics (e.g. more than 81% knew that HPV infection was commonly asymptomatic, 87% were knew that HPV infection was implicated in most cervical cancers and 87% knew that cervical cancer is the most prevalent cancer amongst women) but low knowledge in others and poor understanding of key issues such as the age at which women were most likely to develop cervical cancer (only 15% answered correctly); whether or not the vaccine should be administered to people who had already been affected (27% answered correctly) and whether sexually active young people should be treated for infection before vaccination (26%). Lack of confidence within the surveyed groups regarding the value of vaccination and, in particular concerns over the reasons for administering it to certain age cohorts, was driven by misconceptions.

ConclusionsArmenian physicians awareness of vaccine characteristics, the reasons for their inclusion in the national vaccination programme and the characteristics of the diseases they treat can be poor. The study further suggests that drivers of vaccine hesitancy are complex, may not be consistent from vaccine to vaccine, and may vary from generation to generation. The Armenian healthcare sector may need to provide additional training, awareness-raising and educational activities to improve understanding of and trust in vaccination programmes. Further studies are warranted to better understand knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding immunization and vaccination programmes amongst Armenian healthcare workers.","Badalyan, A.

15278,Novel ELISA protocol links pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibodies with endemic coronavirus immunity and age and reveals improved serologic identification of acute COVID-19 via multi-parameter detection,"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted work, economy, and way of life. The SARS-CoV-2 virus displays unique features including widely varying symptoms and outcomes between infected individuals. Sensitive measurement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies would provide new insight into virus transmission dynamics, pre-existing cross-reactive immunity, and the nuances of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. To date, existing SARS-CoV-2 serology tests have limited utility due to insufficient detection of antibody levels lower than what is typically present after several days of symptoms. To measure lower quantities of SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA with higher resolution than existing assays, we developed a new ELISA protocol with a distinct plate washing procedure and timed plate development via use of a standard curve. This  BU ELISA method exhibits very low signal from plasma or serum samples added to uncoated wells at as low as a 1:5 dilution. Use of this method revealed circulating SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (NP) reactive antibodies from blood samples drawn prior to May 2019. Of our prepandemic cohort, no SARS-CoV-2 RBD-reactive IgG antibodies were detected in subjects over 70 years of age, and SARS-CoV-2 NP-reactive antibodies were present at similar levels to infected subjects in some individuals and very low in others. Also, samples drawn in May 2020 from two individuals with no symptoms or no known virus exposure contained SARS-CoV-2 RBD-reactive antibodies at intermediate amounts compared with other subject groups (higher than pre-pandemic and lower than confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected). The one asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 convalescent subject in our study possessed comparable amounts of SARS-CoV-2 NP-specific IgM and IgG but drastically lower IgA than the symptomatic counterparts. Also, our assay detected positive signal from samples that gave negative results in a commercially available Lateral Flow Device (LFD) and the EUA approved Abbott IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection. We propose that this improved ELISA protocol, which is straightforward to perform, low cost, and uses readily available commercial reagents, is a useful tool to elucidate new information about SARS-CoV-2 infection and has promising implications for improved detection of all analytes measurable by this platform.","Yuen, R.; Steiner, D.; Pihl, R.; Chavez, E.; Olson, A.; Baird, L.; Korkmaz, F.; Urick, P.; Sagar, M.; Berrigan, J.; Gummuluru, R.; Corley, R.; Quillen, K.; Belkina, A.; Mostoslavsky, G.; Rifkin, I.; Kataria, Y.; Cappione, A.; Lin, N.; Bhadelia, N.; Snyder-Cappione, J.; Smith, E.

5577,"Interim Analysis of Pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Latin America and the Caribbean: Morbidity, Mortality and Molecular Testing Trends in the Region","BackgroundThe relentless advance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic has resulted in a significant burden on countries, regardless of their socio-economic conditions. The virus has infected more than 2.5 million people worldwide, causing to date more than 150,000 deaths in over 210 countries.

ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to describe the trends in cases, tests and deaths related to novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries.

MethodologyData were retrieved from the WHO-Coronavirus Disease (COVID-2019) situation reports and the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) databases from Johns Hopkins University. Descriptive statistics including death rates, cumulative mortality and incidence rates, as well as testing rates per population at risk were performed. A comparison analysis among countries with [&ge;]50 confirmed cases was performed from February 26th, 2020 to April 8th, 2020.

ResultsBrazil had the greatest number of cases and deaths in the region. Panama experienced a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases with Trinidad and Tobago, Bolivia and Honduras having the highest case fatality rates. Panama and Chile conducted more tests per million inhabitants and more tests per day per million inhabitants, followed by Uruguay and El Salvador. Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Ecuador and Brazil had the highest positive test rates.

ConclusionsThe COVID-19 disease pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has progressed rapidly in LAC countries. Some countries have been affected more severely than others, with some adopting similar disease control methods to help slow down the spread of the virus. With limited testing and other resources, social distancing is needed to help alleviate the strain on already stretched health systems.","Simbana-Rivera, K.; Gomez-Barreno, L.; Guerrero, J.; Simbana-Guaycha, F.; Fernandez, R.; Lopez-Cortes, A.; Lister, A.; Ortiz-Prado, E.",2020-04-29,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.04.25.20079863,1,Esteban Ortiz-Prado,"OneHealth Global Research Group, Universidad De Las Americas",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079863v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079863v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
16018,Forecasting Covid-19 Infections and Deaths Horizon in Egypt,"The coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic is defining a global health crisis, which is the hugest challenge the world has faced since World War II. Accordingly, the global economy as well is facing the worst economic catastrophe since the 1930s Great Depression. The case in Egypt is similar to the rest of the world. Despite being threatened by GDP decline and income losses; the Egyptian government has reacted early to restrain the pandemic outbreak. By mid-March, many measures had been undertaken to contain the spread of the virus. More than three months after imposing them, Egypt began lifting many of the restrictions put in place to curb the spread of coronavirus. Predictions of the potential spread of Covid-19 based on time series Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and econometric Autoregressive-Distributed Lag (ARDL) forecasting models are utilized in this paper for designing and/or evaluating countermeasures. The aim of this study is threefold, first using the most recent available data to find the best prediction models for daily cases and death in Egypt and forecast them up to 7 November 2020. Second, to analyze the effect of mobility on the incidence of the pandemic using Google Community Mobility Reports (GCMR) to evaluate the results of easing lockdown restrictions. Finally, providing some recommendations that may help lessen the spread of the virus and eradicate new deaths as possible. The results revealed that mobility of population is affecting the incidence of new cases of Covid-19 significantly over the period of the study. Additionally, the total number of infections on November 7 2020 is expected to reach 102,352 cases, while the total death toll is predicted to be 5,938 according to the most accurate methods of forecasting. Accordingly, in order to sustain the predicted flat pandemic curve, many restrictions must be continued and emergency mechanisms need to be considered. For instance, adhering to the precautions of social distancing advised by the health minister and the declared hygiene rules to ensure that infection is prevented or transmitted is necessary. Besides, being prepared with re-imposing lockdown strategies and health system support are essential among others. It should also be noted that this expected pattern can shift, yet that depends on peoples actions.","Nosier, S.; Beram, R.

24791,"SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by viral load, S gene variants and demographic factors and the utility of lateral flow devices to prevent transmission","BackgroundHow SARS-CoV-2 infectivity varies with viral load is incompletely understood. Whether rapid point-of-care antigen lateral flow devices (LFDs) detect most potential transmission sources despite imperfect sensitivity is unknown.

MethodsWe combined SARS-CoV-2 testing and contact tracing data from England between 01-September-2020 and 28-February-2021. We used multivariable logistic regression to investigate relationships between PCR-confirmed infection in contacts of community-diagnosed cases and index case viral load, S gene target failure (proxy for B.1.1.7 infection), demographics, SARS-CoV-2 incidence, social deprivation, and contact event type. We used LFD performance to simulate the proportion of cases with a PCR-positive contact expected to be detected using one of four LFDs.

Results231,498/2,474,066 (9%) contacts of 1,064,004 index cases tested PCR-positive. PCR-positive results in contacts independently increased with higher case viral loads (lower Ct values) e.g., 11.7%(95%CI 11.5-12.0%) at Ct=15 and 4.5%(4.4-4.6%) at Ct=30. B.1.1.7 infection increased PCR-positive results by [~]50%, (e.g. 1.55-fold, 95%CI 1.49-1.61, at Ct=20). PCR-positive results were most common in household contacts (at Ct=20.1, 8.7%[95%CI 8.6-8.9%]), followed by household visitors (7.1%[6.8-7.3%]), contacts at events/activities (5.2%[4.9-5.4%]), work/education (4.6%[4.4-4.8%]), and least common after outdoor contact (2.9%[2.3-3.8%]). Contacts of children were the least likely to test positive, particularly following contact outdoors or at work/education. The most and least sensitive LFDs would detect 89.5%(89.4-89.6%) and 83.0%(82.8-83.1%) of cases with PCR-positive contacts respectively.

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 infectivity varies by case viral load, contact event type, and age. Those with high viral loads are the most infectious. B.1.1.7 increased transmission by [~]50%. The best performing LFDs detect most infectious cases.

Key pointsIn 2,474,066 contacts of 1,064,004 SARS-CoV-2 cases, PCR-positive tests in contacts increased with higher index case viral loads, the B.1.1.7 variant and household contact. Children were less infectious. Lateral flow devices can detect 83.0-89.5% of infections leading to onward transmission.","Lee, L. Y.; Rozmanowski, S.; Pang, M.; Charlett, A.; Anderson, C.; Hughes, G.

23180,Shifting research priorities in maternal and child health in the COVID-19 pandemic era in India: a renewed focus on systems strengthening,"BackgroundThe remarkable progress seen in maternal and child health (MCH) in India over the past two decades has been impacted by setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to undertake a rapid assessment to identify key priorities for public health research in MCH in India within the context and aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsA web-based survey was developed to identify top research priorities in MCH. It consisted of 26 questions on six broad domains: vaccine preventable diseases, outbreak preparedness, primary healthcare integration, maternal health, neonatal health, and infectious diseases. Key stakeholders were invited to participate between September and November 2020. Participants assigned importance on a 5-point Likert scale, and assigned overall ranks to each sub-domain research priority. Descriptive statistics were used to examine Likert scale responses, and a ranking analysis was done to obtain an """"average ranking score"""" and identify the top research priority under each domain.

ResultsAmongst the 84 respondents, 37% were public-health researchers, 25% healthcare providers, 20% academic faculty and 13% were policy makers. Across the six domains, most respondents considered conducting research on systems strengthening as extremely important. The highest ranked research priorities were strengthening the public sector workforce (vaccine preventable diseases), enhancing public-health surveillance networks (outbreak preparedness), nutrition support through community workers (primary care integration), encouraging at least 4-8 antenatal visits (maternal health), neonatal resuscitation to reduce birth asphyxia (neonatal health) and pediatric and maternal screening and treatment of tuberculosis (infectious diseases). Common themes identified through open-ended questions were also systems strengthening priorities across domains.

ConclusionsThe overall focus for research priorities in MCH in India during the COVID-19 pandemic is on strengthening existing services and service delivery, rather than novel research. Our results highlight pivotal steps within the roadmap for advancing and sustaining maternal and child health gains during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Mehta, K.; Zodpey, S.; Banerjee, P.; Pocius, S.

24719,Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 in a non-hospitalized cohort: results from the Arizona CoVHORT,"Clinical presentation, outcomes, and duration of COVID-19 has ranged dramatically. While some individuals recover quickly, others suffer from persistent symptoms, collectively known as post-acute sequelae of SAR-CoV-2 (PASC). Most PASC research has focused on hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe disease. We used data from a diverse population-based cohort of Arizonans to estimate prevalence of various symptoms of PASC, defined as experiencing at least one symptom 30 days or longer. There were 303 non-hospitalized individuals with a positive lab-confirmed COVID-19 test who were followed for a median of 61 days (range 30-250). COVID-19 positive participants were mostly female (70%), non-Hispanic white (68%), and on average 44 years old. Prevalence of PASC at 30 days post-infection was 68.7% (95%CI 63.4, 73.9). The most common symptoms were fatigue (37.5%), shortness-of-breath (37.5%), brain fog (30.8%), and stress (30.8%). The median number of symptoms was 3 (range 1-20). Amongst 157 participants with longer follow-up ([&ge;]60 days), PASC prevalence was 77.1%.","Bell, M. L.; Catalfamo, C. J.; Farland, L. V.; Ernst, K. C.; Jacobs, E. T.; Klimentidis, Y.

19996,"SARS-CoV-2 infection, risk perception, behaviour, and preventive measures at schools in Berlin, Germany, during the early post-lockdown phase: A cross-sectional study","BackgroundBriefly before the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Berlin, Germany, schools closed in mid-March 2020 for six weeks. Following re-opening, schools gradually resumed operation at a reduced level for nine weeks preceding the summer holidays.

AimDuring this phase, we conducted a situational assessment in schools among students and teachers as to infection status, symptoms, affective, behavioural, educational issues, and preventive measures.

MethodsAt twenty-four randomly selected primary and secondary schools, one class each was examined. Oro-nasopharyngeal swabs and capillary blood samples were collected to assess SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR) and specific IgG (ELISA), respectively. Medical history, household and schooling characteristics, leisure time activities, fear of infection, risk perception, hand hygiene, physical distancing, and facemask wearing were assessed.

ResultsAmong 535 participants (385 students, 150 staff), one teenager was SARS-CoV-2 infected (0.2%), and seven individuals exhibited specific IgG (1.3%); 16% reported symptoms upon examination, and 48% in the preceding 14 days. Compared to before the pandemic, the proportion of leisure time spent as screen-time increased, and the majority of primary school students reported reduced physical activity. Fear of infection and risk perception were relatively low, but acceptance of adapted health behaviours was high. Governmental preventive measures were adequately implemented, with primary schools performing better than secondary schools.

ConclusionIn this phase of rare infection and low seroreactivity, individual and school-level infection prevention and control measures were largely adhered to. Nevertheless, vigilance, continued and proactive preventive measures, and well-rehearsed reaction options are essential to cope with increasing pandemic activity.","Hommes, F.; Van Loon, W.; Thielecke, M.; Abramovich, I.; Lieber, S.; Hammerich, R.; Gehrke-Beck, S.; Linzbach, E.; Schuster, A.; Von Dem Busche, K.; Theuring, S.; Gertler, M.; Equihua Martinez, G.; Richter, J.; Bergmann, C.; Bölke, A.; Böhringer, F.; Mall, M.

16147,Design Of A Rapid And Reversible Fluorescence Assay To Detect COVID-19 And Other Pathogens,"We describe a rapid and reusable biophysical method to assay COVID-19 and other pathogens. The method uses fluorescent sensors (i.e. molecular beacons) designed to detect COVID-19 RNA or any RNA of interest, concurrent with an internal control without the need for amplification. The molecular beacons are stem-loop structures in which a [~]10 nucleotide loop region has the complementary sequence of a region of the target RNA, and a fluorophore and quencher are placed on the 5 and 3 ends of the stem. The energy of hybridization of the loop with its target is designed to be greater than the hybridization energy of the energy of the stem so that when the beacon encounters its target RNA, the structure opens resulting in dequenching of the fluorophore. Here, we designed a COVID-19 beacon that is completely quenched in its native form and undergoes a 50-fold increase in fluorescence when exposed to nanomolar amounts of synthetic viral oligonucleotide. No changes in intensity are seen when control RNA is added. A control beacon to a human GAPDH RNA, chosen for its high levels in saliva, behaved similar to the COVID-19 beacon. This increase in fluorescence with beacon opening can be completely reversed upon addition of single stranded DNA complementary to COVID-19 beacon loop region. Beacons can be attached to an insert matrix allowing their use in concentrated form and can be made from morphilino oligonucleotides that are resistant to RNases. We present an analysis of the parameters that will allow the development of test strips to detect virus in aerosol, body fluids and community waste.

9563,"At-home self-collection of saliva, oropharyngeal swabs and dried blood spots for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and serology: post-collection acceptability of specimen collection process and patient confidence in specimens","BackgroundOptions to increase the ease of testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune response are needed. Self-collection of diagnostic specimens at home offers an avenue to allow people to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection or immune response without traveling to a clinic or laboratory. Before this study, survey respondents indicated willingness to self-collect specimens for COVID-related tests, but hypothetical willingness can differ from post-collection acceptability after participants collect specimens.

Methods153 US adults were enrolled in a study of the willingness and feasibility of patients to self-collect three diagnostic specimens (saliva, oropharyngeal swab (OPS) and dried blood spot (DBS) card) while observed by a clinician through a telehealth session. After the specimens were collected, 148 participants participated in a survey about the acceptability of the collection, packing and shipping process, and their confidence in the samples collected for COVID-related laboratory testing.

ResultsA large majority of participants (>84%) reported that collecting, packing and shipping of saliva, OPS, and DBS specimens were acceptable. Nearly nine in 10 (87%) reported being confident or very confident that the specimens they collected were sufficient for laboratory analysis. There were no differences in acceptability for any specimen type, packing and shipping, or confidence in samples by gender, age, race/ethnicity, or educational level.

ConclusionsSelf-collection of specimens for SARS-CoV-2 testing and preparing and shipping specimens for analysis were acceptable in a diverse group of US adults. Further refinement of materials and instructions to support self-collection of saliva, OPS and DBS specimens for COVID-related testing is needed.

2372,"Estimating the scale of COVID-19 Epidemic in the United States: Simulations Based on Air Traffic directly from Wuhan, China","IntroductionCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has been characterized by rapid spread and unusually large case clusters. It is important to have an estimate of the current state of COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. to help develop informed public health strategies.

MethodsWe estimated the potential scale of the COVID-19 epidemic (as of 03/01/2020) in the U.S. from cases  imported directly from Wuhan area. We used simulations based on transmission dynamics parameters estimated from previous studies and air traffic data from Wuhan to the U.S and deliberately built our model based on conservative assumptions. Detection and quarantine of individual COVID-19 cases in the U.S before 03/01/2020 were also taken into account. A SEIR model was used to simulate the growth of the number of infected individuals in Wuhan area and in the U.S.

ResultsWith the most likely model, we estimated that there would be 9,484 infected cases (90%CI 2,054-24,241) as of 03/01/2020 if no successful intervention procedure had been taken to reduce the transmissibility in unidentified cases. Assuming current preventive procedures have reduced 25% of the transmissibility in unidentified cases, the number of infected cases would be 1,043 (90%CI 107-2,474).

ConclusionOur research indicates that, as of 03/01/2020., it is likely that there are already thousands of individuals in the US infected with SARS-CoV-2. Our model is dynamic and is available to the research community to further evaluate as the situation becomes clearer.","Li, D.; Lv, J.; Botwin, G.; Braun, J.; Cao, W.; Li, L.; Mcgovern, D. P.

17955,Longitudinal Physiological Data from a Wearable Device Identifies SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Symptoms and Predicts COVID-19 Diagnosis,"BackgroundChanges in autonomic nervous system function, characterized by heart rate variability (HRV), have been associated with and observed prior to the clinical identification of infection. We performed an evaluation of this metric collected by wearable devices, to identify and predict Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its related symptoms.

MethodsHealth care workers in the Mount Sinai Health System were prospectively followed in an ongoing observational study using the custom Warrior Watch Study App which was downloaded to their smartphones. Participants wore an Apple Watch for the duration of the study measuring HRV throughout the follow up period. Surveys assessing infection and symptom related questions were obtained daily.

FindingsUsing a mixed-effect COSINOR model the mean amplitude of the circadian pattern of the standard deviation of the interbeat interval of normal sinus beats (SDNN), a HRV metric, differed between subjects with and without COVID-19 (p=0.006). The mean amplitude of this circadian pattern differed between individuals during the 7 days before and the 7 days after a COVID-19 diagnosis compared to this metric during uninfected time periods (p=0.01). Significant changes in the mean MESOR and amplitude of the circadian pattern of the SDNN was observed between the first day of reporting a COVID-19 related symptom compared to all other symptom free days (p=0.01).

InterpretationLongitudinally collected HRV metrics from a commonly worn commercial wearable device (Apple Watch) can identify the diagnosis of COVID-19 and COVID-19 related symptoms. Prior to the diagnosis of COVID-19 by nasal PCR, significant changes in HRV were observed demonstrating its predictive ability to identify COVID-19 infection.

13299,Underdetection of COVID-19 cases in France in the exit phase following lockdown,"A novel testing policy was implemented in May in France to systematically screen potential COVID-19 infections and suppress local outbreaks while lifting lockdown restrictions. 20,736 virologically-confirmed cases were reported in mainland France from May 13, 2020 (week 20, end of lockdown) to June 28 (week 26). Accounting for missing data and the delay from symptom onset to confirmation test, this corresponds to 7,258 [95% CI 7,160-7,336] cases with symptom onset during this period, a likely underestimation of the real number. Using age-stratified transmission models parameterized to behavioral data and calibrated to regional hospital admissions, we estimated that 69,115 [58,072-77,449] COVID-19 symptomatic cases occurred, suggesting that 9 out of 10 cases with symptoms were not ascertained. Median detection rate increased from 7% [6-9]% to 31% [28-35]% over time, with regional estimates varying from 11% (Grand Est) to 78% (Normandy) by the end of June. Healthcare-seeking behavior in COVID-19 suspect cases remained low (31%) throughout the period. Model projections for the incidence of symptomatic cases (4.5 [3.9-5.0] per 100,000) were compatible with estimates integrating participatory and virological surveillance data, assuming all suspect cases consulted. Encouraging healthcare-seeking behavior and awareness in suspect cases is critical to improve detection. Substantially more aggressive and efficient testing with easier access is required to act as a pandemic-fighting tool. These elements should be considered in light of the currently observed resurgence of cases in France and other European countries.","Pullano, G.; Di Domenico, L.; Sabbatini, C.

6388,Efficacy of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients with a simulated two-arm controlled study,"While the recent study on the compassionate use of remdesivir for COVID-19 patients has shown a 68% clinical improvement7 it is a one-arm study that renders the evaluation of the efficacy in reducing death and the length of stay of hospitalization intractable due to a lacking of the control group. We came up with a two-arm controlled study design to simulate the treated and the untreated (control group) group by applying two respective transition models to the empirical data on dynamics of the disease severity (Figure 2 of the original article7) that are classified into low- (no and low oxygen supplement), medium- (non-invasive ventilator and high oxygen supplement), and high-(ECMO and invasive ventilator) from enrolment until discharge, death or the end of follow-up. By using a simulated two-arm controlled study, the remdesivir treatment group as opposed to the control group led to a statistically significantly 29% (95% CI: 22-35%) reduction of death from COVID-19. The treated group also revealed a 33% (95% CI 28-38%) significantly higher odds of discharge than the control group. The median time to discharge for the treated group (5.5 days, 16.5 days, and 29.5 days for low-, medium-, and high-risk state, respectively) was around half of those of the control arm. Our results with a simulated two-arm controlled study have not only corroborated the efficacy of remdesivir but also made great contribution to designing a further large-scale randomized controlled trial. They have significant implications for reducing transmission probability and infectious time of COVID-19 patients when contacting with susceptible health care workers during hospitalization.

20803,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants in Switzerland by genomic analysis of wastewater samples,"The SARS-CoV-2 lineages B.1.1.7 and 501.V2, which were first detected in the United Kingdom and South Africa, respectively, are spreading rapidly in the human population. Thus, there is an increased need for genomic and epidemiological surveillance in order to detect the strains and estimate their abundances. Here, we report a genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in 48 raw wastewater samples collected from three wastewater treatment plants in Switzerland between July 9 and December 21, 2020. We find evidence for the presence of several mutations that define the B.1.1.7 and 501.V2 lineages in some of the samples, including co-occurrences of up to three B.1.1.7 signature mutations on the same amplicon in four samples from Lausanne and one sample from a Swiss ski resort dated December 9 - 21. These findings suggest that the B.1.1.7 strain could be detected by mid December, two weeks before its first verification in a patient sample from Switzerland. We conclude that sequencing SARS-CoV-2 in community wastewater samples may help detect and monitor the circulation of diverse lineages.","Jahn, K.; Dreifuss, D.; Topolsky, I.; Kull, A.; Ganesanandamoorthy, P.; Fernandez-Cassi, X.; Bänziger, C.; Stachler, E.; Fuhrmann, L.; Jablonski, K.

5954,A cohort of patients with COVID-19 in a major teaching hospital in Europe,"BACKGROUNDSince the confirmation of the first patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Spain in January 2020, the epidemic has grown rapidly, with the greatest impact on the Madrid region. This article describes the first 2226 consecutive adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to the La Paz University Hospital in Madrid.

METHODSOur cohort included all consecutively admitted patients who were hospitalized and who had a final outcome (death or discharge) in a 1286-bed hospital of Madrid (Spain) from February 25th (first case admitted) to April 19th, 2020. Data was entered manually into an electronic case report form, which was monitored prior to the analysis.

RESULTSWe consecutively included 2226 adult patients admitted to the hospital who either died (460) or were discharged (1766). The patients median age was 61 years; 51.8% were women. The most common comorbidity was arterial hypertension (41.3%). The most common symptom on admission were fever (71.2%). The median time from disease onset to hospital admission was 6 days. Overall mortality was 20.7% and was higher in men (26.6% vs 15.1%). Seventy-five patients with a final outcome were transferred to the ICU (3.4%). Most patients admitted to the ICU were men, and the median age was 64 years. Baseline laboratory values on admission were consistent with an impaired immune-inflammatory profile.

CONCLUSIONSWe provide a description of the first large cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Europe.

9108,Optimal Control Measures to Combat COVID19 Spread in Sri Lanka: A Mathematical ModelConsidering the Heterogeneity of Cases,"The COVID 19 pandemic caused by the novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) has been one of the major public health concerns across the globe, currently more than 3.5 million individuals have been infected, and the number of deaths has passed 250,000. The world wide burden of the disease has been massive, and the governments are in dilemma to protect the health system of the country while safeguarding the economy. There is no vaccine or antivirus drug found against this virus while multiple research groups are actively working on a suitable candidate. The only available mode of minimizing the disease burden has been to control its transmission among the population. Since the occurrence of first COVID 19 local case on 11 March 2020, the government of Sri Lanka introduced serious social distancing and public health interventions in its fullest capacity as a developing nation to effectively combat with the disease spread. This study focuses to develop a mathematical model to investigate the dynamic of this novel disease using an extended version of an SEIR compartmental structure considering the heterogeneity of cases such as asymptomatic, symptomatic with mild indications and the cases required intensive care treatments. All the measures and interventions are in progress with a significantly large social and economic cost, thus, optimal control techniques are used to identify the most appropriate strategies to minimize this cost. The results of the simulations prove that optimal control measures can be worked out as the epidemic curves are flattened while delaying the outbreak so that the health system might not be under pressure to treat and care the patients.","Wickramaarachchi, T.; Perera, S.",2020-06-05,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.04.20122382,1,Tharindu Wickramaarachchi Sr.,The Open University of sri Lanka,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.04.20122382v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.04.20122382v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
2210,Precautions are Needed for COVID-19 Patients with Coinfection of Common Respiratory Pathogens,"BackgroundWith the ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), infected patients within and beyond the epidemic area, Wuhan, China, showed different epidemiological and clinical characteristics. There is a paucity of data concerning coinfection with other common respiratory pathogens in COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan.

MethodsWe conducted a double-centre study recruiting 68 patients with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing in Qingdao and Wuhan from January 17 to February 16, 2020. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed to detect the specific IgM antibody against common respiratory pathogens in collected acute phase serum.

ResultsOf the 68 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 30 (44.12%) were from Qingdao. The median age of Qingdao and Wuhan patients were 50 (IQR: 37-59) and 31 (IQR: 28-38) years, respectively, and the majority of patients were female in Qingdao (60.00%) and Wuhan (55.26%). Among COVID-19 patients in Qingdao, 24 (80.00%) of them had IgM antibodies against at least one respiratory pathogen, whereas only one (2.63%) of the patients in Wuhan had positive results for serum IgM antibody detection (P<0.0001). The most common respiratory pathogens detected in Qingdao COVID-19 patients were influenza virus A (60.00%) and influenza virus B (53.33%), followed by mycoplasma pneumoniae (23.33%) and legionella pneumophila (20.00%). While the pattern for coinfection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Qingdao was quite different, with a positive rate of only 20.90%.

InterpretationWe reported a large proportion of COVID-19 patients with coinfection of seasonal respiratory pathogens in Qingdao, northeast China, which differed greatly from the patients in Wuhan, central China. Precautions are needed when dealing with COVID-19 patients beyond the epidemic centre who have coinfection with other respiratory pathogens. We highly recommend adding SARS-CoV-2 to routine diagnostic testing in capable hospitals to prevent misdetection of the virus.","Xing, Q.; Li, G.; Xing, Y.; Chen, T.; Li, W.; Ni, W.; Deng, K.; Gao, R.; Chen, C.; Gao, Y.; Li, Q.; Yu, G.; Tong, J.; Li, W.; Hao, G.; Sun, Y.; Zhang, A.; Wu, Q.; Li, Z.; Pan, S.",2020-03-05,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.02.29.20027698,2,Quansheng Xing,Qingdao Women and Children\'s Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20027698v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20027698v2.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
15915,Which early indicator allows for a better understanding of the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in France?,"We provide an explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the dynamic of the positive COVID-19 test rates and of the numbers of COVID-19-related hospital and intensive care admissions and deaths in France. We highlight the existence of a latency period of around 5 weeks between the infections of young individual (generally asymptomatic) to older individuals that may have a severe form of the disease and may be hospitalized. If the overall positive detection rate provided relevant information until the end of August, since the beginning of September the overall positive detection rate has reached a plateau and no longer provides relevant information on the current state of the epidemic. We show that the positive detection rate in the 70+ age group is a relevant and early indicator of the epidemic. Furthermore, we have shown an identical doubling time of around 16 days for the following indicators: the positive tests rate for the 70+ age group, the number of new admissions to hospital, intensive care unit admissions and deaths.","Loisel, P.",2020-10-01,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.29.20203760,3,Patrice Loisel,INRAE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.29.20203760v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.29.20203760v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
3735,Core warming of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients undergoing mechanical ventilation: protocol for a randomized controlled pilot study,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, is spreading rapidly across the globe, with no proven effective therapy. Fever is seen in most cases of COVID-19, at least at the initial stages of illness. Although fever is typically treated (with antipyretics or directly with ice or other mechanical means), increasing data suggest that fever is a protective adaptive response that facilitates recovery from infectious illness.

ObjectiveTo describe a randomized controlled pilot study of core warming patients with COVID-19 undergoing mechanical ventilation.

MethodsThis prospective single-site randomized controlled pilot study will enroll 20 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to standard-of-care or to receive core warming via an esophageal heat exchanger commonly utilized in critical care and surgical patients. The primary outcome is the severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (as measured by PaO2/FiO2 ratio) at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours after initiation of treatment. Secondary outcomes include hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, viral load, and 30-day mortality.

ResultsResulting data will provide effect size estimates to guide a definitive multi-center randomized clinical trial. ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT04426344.

ConclusionsWith growing data to support clinical benefits of elevated temperature in infectious illness, this study will provide data to guide further understanding of the role of active temperature management in COVID-19 treatment and provide effect size estimates to power larger studies.","Bonfanti, N.; Gundert, E.; Goff, K.; Drewry, A.; Bedimo, R.; Kulstad, E.",2020-09-08,Intensive Care And Critical Care Medicine,10.1101/2020.04.03.20052001,2,Erik Kulstad,UT Southwestern Medical Center,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052001v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052001v2.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1371/journal.pone.0243190

13244,"Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of molecular and serological tests for COVID-19. A longitudinal study in emergency room.","Accuracy of diagnostic tests is essential for suspected cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to assess the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV) of molecular and serological tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 346 consenting, adult patients were enrolled at the emergency room of IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital, Negrar, Italy. We evaluated three RT-PCR methods including six different gene targets; five serologic rapid diagnostic tests (RDT); one ELISA test. The final classification of infected/not infected patients was performed using Latent Class Analysis in combination with clinical re-assessment of incongruous cases and was the basis for the main analysis of accuracy.

Of 346 patients consecutively enrolled, 85 (24.6%) were classified as infected. The molecular test with the highest sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV was RQ-SARS-nCoV-2 with 91.8% (C.I. 83.8-96.6), 100% (C.I. 98.6-100.0), 100.0% (C.I. 95.4-100.0) and 97.4% (C.I. 94.7-98.9) respectively, followed by CDC 2019-nCoV with 76.2% (C.I. 65.7-84.8), 99.6% (C.I. 97.9-100.0), 98.5% (C.I. 91.7-100.0) and 92.9% (C.I. 89.2-95.6) and by in-house test targeting E-RdRp with 61.2% (C.I. 50.0-71.6), 99.6% (C.I. 97.9-100.0), 98.1% (C.I. 89.9-100.0) and 88.7% (C.I. 84.6-92.1). The analyses on single gene targets found the highest sensitivity for S and RdRp of the RQ-SARS-nCoV-2 (both with sensitivity 94.1%, C.I. 86.8-98.1). The in-house RdRp had the lowest sensitivity (62.4%, C.I. 51.2-72.6). The specificity ranged from 99.2% (C.I. 97.3-99.9) for in-house RdRp and N2 to 95.0% (C.I. 91.6-97.3) for E. The PPV ranged from 97.1% (C.I. 89.8-99.6) of N2 to 85.4% (C.I. 76.3-92.00) of E, and the NPV from 98.1% (C.I. 95.5-99.4) of gene S to 89.0% (C.I. 84.8-92.4) of in-house RdRp. All serological tests had <50% sensitivity and low PPV and NPV. One RDT (VivaDiag IgM) had high specificity (98.5%, with PPV 84.0%), but poor sensitivity (24.7%). Molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection showed excellent specificity, but significant differences in sensitivity. As expected, serological tests have limited utility in a clinical context.","Bisoffi, Z.; Pomari, E.; Deiana, M.; Piubelli, C.; Ronzoni, N.; Beltrame, A.; Bertoli, G.; Riccardi, N.; Perandin, F.; Formenti, F.; Gobbi, F.; Buonfrate, D.; Silva, R.",2020-08-11,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.09.20171355,1,Elena Pomari,IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.09.20171355v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.09.20171355v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.3390/diagnostics10090669
7292,"Anti-Spike, anti-Nucleocapsid and neutralizing antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 inpatients and asymptomatic carriers","ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to monitor the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in infected patients.

MethodsIn order to assess the time of seroconversion, we used 151 samples from 30 COVID-19 inpatients and monitored the detection kinetics of anti-S1, anti-S2, anti-RBD and anti-N antibodies with in-house ELISAs. We also monitored the presence of neutralizing antibodies in these samples as well as 25 asymptomatic carrier samples using retroviral particles pseudotyped with the spike of the SARS-CoV-2.

ResultsWe observed that specific antibodies were detectable in all inpatients two weeks post-symptom onset. The detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid and RBD was more sensitive than the detection of the S1 or S2 subunits. Neutralizing antibodies reached a plateau two weeks post-symptom onset and then declined in the majority of inpatients. Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies were undetectable in 56% of asymptomatic carriers.

ConclusionsOur results raise questions concerning the role played by neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 cure and protection against secondary infection. They also suggest that induction of neutralizing antibodies is not the only strategy to adopt for the development of a vaccine. Finally, they imply that anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies should be titrated to optimize convalescent plasma therapy.

9388,Excess deaths in people with cardiovascular diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"BackgroundCardiovascular diseases(CVD) increase mortality risk from coronavirus infection(COVID-19), but there are concerns that the pandemic has affected supply and demand of acute cardiovascular care. We estimated excess mortality in specific CVDs, both """"direct"""", through infection, and """"indirect"""", through changes in healthcare.

MethodsWe used population-based electronic health records from 3,862,012 individuals in England to estimate pre- and post-COVID-19 mortality risk(""""direct"""" effect) for people with incident and prevalent CVD. We incorporated: (i)pre-COVID-19 risk by age, sex and comorbidities, (ii)estimated population COVID-19 prevalence, and (iii)estimated relative impact of COVID-19 on mortality(relative risk, RR: 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0). For """"indirect"""" effects, we analysed weekly mortality and emergency department data for England/Wales and monthly hospital data from England(n=2), China(n=5) and Italy(n=1) for CVD referral, diagnosis and treatment until 1 May 2020.

FindingsCVD service activity decreased by 60-100% compared with pre-pandemic levels in eight hospitals across China, Italy and England during the pandemic. In China, activity remained below pre-COVID-19 levels for 2-3 months even after easing lockdown, and is still reduced in Italy and England. Mortality data suggest indirect effects on CVD will be delayed rather than contemporaneous(peak RR 1.4). For total CVD(incident and prevalent), at 10% population COVID-19 rate, we estimated direct impact of 31,205 and 62,410 excess deaths in England at RR 1.5 and 2.0 respectively, and indirect effect of 49932 to 99865 excess deaths.

InterpretationSupply and demand for CVD services have dramatically reduced across countries with potential for substantial, but avoidable, excess mortality during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsA web-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April 13 to May 5, 2020. Adult residents of Greece anonymously completed an online survey that was distributed through email and social media. A total of 1396 fully complete questionnaires were collected. Demographic questions, questions regarding the knowledge about the disease etiology, diagnosis and prevention, and questions related to the respondents attitude and perception toward the restriction measures and the confidence in different kinds of institutions providing information were included in the survey items. The appropriate statistical analyses were conducted according to the type of variable and the research question.

4871,A Global Scale Estimate of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases Using Extreme Value Distributions,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis and the governments are fighting rigorously to control the spread by imposing intervention measures and increasing the medical facilities. In order to tackle the crisis effectively we need to know the trajectories of number of the people infected (i.e. confirmed cases). Such information is crucial to government agencies for developing effective preparedness plans and strategies. We used a statistical modeling approach - extreme value distributions (EVDs) for projecting the future confirmed cases on a global scale. Using the 69 days data (from January 22, 2020 to March 30, 2020), the EVDs model predicted the number of confirmed cases from March 31, 2020 to April 9, 2020 (validation period) with an absolute percentage error < 15 % and then projected the number of confirmed cases until the end of June 2020. Also, we have quantified the uncertainty in the future projections due to the delay in reporting of the confirmed cases on a global scale. Based on the projections, we found that total confirmed cases would reach around 11.4 million globally by the end of June 2020.The USA may have 2.9 million number of confirmed cases followed by Spain-1.52 million and Italy-1.28 million.","Aadhityaa, M.; Kasiviswanathan, K.; Ilampooranan, I.; Soundharajan, B.; Balamurugan, M.; He, J.",2020-04-22,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.17.20069500,1,Ks Kasiviswanathan,"Department of Water Resources Development and Management, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069500v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069500v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
3150,UV Sterilization of Personal Protective Equipment with Idle Laboratory Biosafety Cabinets During the Covid-19 Pandemic,"DISCLAIMERThis article does not represent the official recommendation of the Cleveland Clinic or Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, nor has it yet been peer reviewed. We are releasing it early, pre-peer review, to allow for quick dissemination/vetting by the scientific/clinical community given the necessity for rapid conservation of personal protective equipment (PPE) during this dire global situation. We welcome feedback from the community.

Personal protective equipment (PPE), including face shields, surgical masks, and N95 respirators, is crucially important to the safety of both patients and medical personnel, particularly in the event of an infectious pandemic. As the incidence of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) increases exponentially in the United States and worldwide, healthcare provider demand for these necessities is currently outpacing supply. As such, strategies to extend the lifespan of the supply of medical equipment as safely as possible are critically important. In the midst of the current pandemic, there has been a concerted effort to identify viable ways to conserve PPE, including decontamination after use. Some hospitals have already begun using UV-C light to decontaminate N95 respirators and other PPE, but many lack the space or equipment to implement existing protocols. In this study, we outline a procedure by which PPE may be decontaminated using ultraviolet (UV) radiation in biosafety cabinets (BSCs), a common element of many academic, public health, and hospital laboratories, and discuss the dose ranges needed for effective decontamination of critical PPE. We further discuss obstacles to this approach including the possibility that the UV radiation levels vary within BSCs. Effective decontamination of N95 respirator masks or surgical masks requires UV-C doses of greater than 1 Jcm-2, which would take a minimum of 4.3 hours per side when placing the N95 at the bottom of the BSCs tested in this study. Elevating the N95 mask by 48 cm (so that it lies 19 cm from the top of the BSC) would enable the delivery of germicidal doses of UV-C in 62 minutes per side. Effective decontamination of face shields likely requires a much lower UV-C dose, and may be achieved by placing the face shields at the bottom of the BSC for 20 minutes per side. Our results are intended to provide support to healthcare organizations looking for alternative methods to extend their reserves of PPE. We recognize that institutions will require robust quality control processes to guarantee the efficacy of any implemented decontamination protocol. We also recognize that in certain situations such institutional resources may not be available; while we subscribe to the general principle that some degree of decontamination is preferable to re-use without decontamination, we would strongly advise that in such cases at least some degree of on-site verification of UV dose delivery be performed.","Weaver, D.

18585,Multicenter evaluation of the Panbio COVID-19 Rapid Antigen-Detection Test for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection,"The standard RT-PCR assay for COVID-19 is laborious and time-consuming, limiting the availability of testing. Rapid antigen-detection tests are faster and less expensive; however, the reliability of these tests must be validated before they can be used widely. The objective of this study was to determine the reliability of the PanbioTM COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (PanbioRT) (Abbott) for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab specimens. This was a prospective multicenter study in ten Spanish university hospitals of patients from hospital units with clinical symptoms or epidemiological criteria for COVID-19. Patients whose onset of symptoms or exposure was more than 7 days earlier were excluded. Two nasopharyngeal exudate samples were taken to perform the PanbioRT and a diagnostic RT-PCR test. Among the 958 patients studied, 359 (37.5%) were positive by RT-PCR and 325 (33.9%) were also positive by the PanbioRT. Agreement was 95.7% (kappa score: 0.90). All 34 false-negative PanbioRT results were in symptomatic patients, with 23.5% of them at 6-7 days since the onset of symptoms and 58.8% presenting CT >30 values for RT-PCR, indicating a low viral load. Overall sensitivity and specificity for the PanbioRT were 90.5% and 98.8%, respectively. The PanbioRT provides good clinical performance as a point-of-care test, with even more reliable results for patients with a shorter clinical course of the disease or a higher viral load.

12853,Effectiveness of Convalescent Plasma for Treatment of COVID-19 Patients,"Background and objectiveThe outbreak of COVID-19 has become a global health concern. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma therapy in patients with severe and critically ill COVID-19.

MethodsSixteen COVID-19 patients received transfusion of anti-COVID-19 antibody-positive convalescent plasma. The main outcome was time for viral nucleic acid amplification (NAA) test turning negative. Clinical laboratory parameters were measured at the baseline (d0) before plasma transfusion, and day 1 (d1), day 3 (d3) after transfusion as well.

ResultsAmong the 16 patients, 10 of them had a consistently positive result of viral NAA test before convalescent plasma transfusion. Eight patients (8/10) became negative from day 2 to day 8 after transfusion. Severe patients showed a shorter time for NAA test turning negative after transfusion (mean rank 2.17 vs 5{middle dot}90, P = 0.036). Two critically ill patients transfused plasma with lower antibody level remained a positive result of NAA test. CRP level demonstrated a decline 1 day after convalescent plasma treatment, compared with the baseline (P = 0.017). No adverse events were observed during convalescent plasma transfusion.

ConclusionsViral NAA test of most patients with COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma transfusion turned negative on the 2nd to 8th days after transfusion, and the negative time of severe patients was shorter than that of critically ill patients.

7355,"Integration of clinical characteristics, lab tests and a deep learning CT scan analysis to predict severity of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","The SARS-COV-2 pandemic has put pressure on Intensive Care Units, and made the identification of early predictors of disease severity a priority. We collected clinical, biological, chest CT scan data, and radiology reports from 1,003 coronavirus-infected patients from two French hospitals. Among 58 variables measured at admission, 11 clinical and 3 radiological variables were associated with severity. Next, using 506,341 chest CT images, we trained and evaluated deep learning models to segment the scans and reproduce radiologists annotations. We also built CT image-based deep learning models that predicted severity better than models based on the radiologists reports. Finally, we showed that adding CT scan information--either through radiologist lesion quantification or through deep learning--to clinical and biological data, improves prediction of severity. These findings show that CT scans contain novel and unique prognostic information, which we included in a 6-variable ScanCov severity score.","Lassau, N.; Ammari, S.; Chouzenoux, E.; Gortais, H.; Herent, P.; Devilder, M.; Soliman, S.; Meyrignac, O.; Talabard, M.-P.; Lamarque, J.-P.; Dubois, R.; Loiseau, N.; Trichelair, P.; Bendjebbar, E.; Garcia, G.; Balleyguier, C.; Merad, M.; Stoclin, A.; Jegou, S.; Griscelli, F.; Tetelboum, N.; Li, Y.; Verma, S.; Terris, M.; Dardouri, T.; Gupta, K.; Neacsu, A.; Chemouni, F.; Sefta, M.; Jehanno, P.; Bousaid, I.; Boursin, Y.; Planchet, E.; Azoulay, M.; Dachary, J.; Brulport, F.; Gonzalez, A.; Dehaene, O.; Schiratti, J.-B.; Schutte, K.; Pesquet, J.-C.; Talbot, H.; Pronier, E.; Wainrib, G.; Clozel, T.",2020-10-06,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.14.20101972,3,Michael G.

12840,Estimating the reproductive number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States and eight European countries and implications for vaccination,"SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread from a regional outbreak to a global pandemic in just a few months. Global research efforts have focused on developing effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes, COVID-19. However, some of the basic epidemiological parameters, such as the exponential epidemic growth rate and the basic reproductive number, R0, across geographic areas are still not well quantified. Here, we developed and fit a mathematical model to case and death count data collected from the United States and eight European countries during the early epidemic period before broad control measures were implemented. Results show that the early epidemic grew exponentially at rates between 0.19-0.29/day (epidemic doubling times between 2.4-3.6 days). We discuss the current estimates of the mean serial interval, and argue that existing evidence suggests that the interval is between 6-8 days in the absence of active isolation efforts. Using parameters consistent with this range, we estimated the median R0 value to be 5.8 (confidence interval: 4.7-7.3) in the United States and between 3.6 and 6.1 in the eight European countries. This translates to herd immunity thresholds needed to stop transmission to be between 73% and 84%. We further analyze how vaccination schedules depends on R0, the duration of vaccine-induced immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and show that individual-level heterogeneity in vaccine induced immunity can significantly affect vaccination schedules.

SignificanceWith the global efforts to develop vaccines for COVID-19, it is important to understand the contagiousness of the virus to design regional vaccination policy. To that end, we fit a mathematical model to data collected from the early epidemic period in the United States and eight European countries, estimating that the early epidemic doubles between 2.4-3.6 days. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible in the absence of strong control measures irrespective of heterogeneity in geographic and social settings. We estimated the median basic reproduction number, R0 to be 5.8 (confidence interval: 4.7-7.3) in the United States and between 3.6 and 6.1 in the eight European countries. The herd immunity needed to stop transmission is high (between 73% and 84%).","Ke, R.; Romero-Severson, E.

12252,The role of mathematical model in curbing COVID-19 in Nigeria,"The role of mathematical models in controlling infectious diseases cannot be overemphasized. COVID-19 is a viral disease that is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which has no approved vaccine. The available control measures are non-pharmacological interventions like wearing face masks, social distancing, and lockdown which are being advocated for by the WHO. This work assesses the impact of non-pharmaceutical control measures (social distancing and use of face-masks) and mass testing on the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria. A community-based transmission model for COVID-19 in Nigeria is formulated with observing social distancing, wearing face masks in public and mass testing. The model is parameterized using Nigeria data on COVID-19 in Nigeria. The basic reproduction number is found to be less than unity(R0 < 1) when the compliance with intervention measures is moderate (50% [&le;]  <70%) and the testing rate per day is moderate (0.5 [&le;]{sigma} 2 < 0.7) or when the liance with intervention measures is strict ( [&ge;] 70%) and the testing rate per day is poor ({sigma}2 = 0.3). This implies that Nigeria will be able to halt the spread of COVID-19 under these two conditions. However, it will be easier to enforce strict compliance with intervention measures in the presence of poor testing rate due to the limited availability of testing facilities and manpower in Nigeria. Hence, this study advocates that Nigerian governments (Federal and States) should aim at achieving a testing rate of at least 0.3 per day while ensuring that all the citizens strictly comply with wearing face masks and observing social distancing in public.","Madubueze, C.

17554,U-shaped-aggressiveness of SARS-CoV-2: Period between initial symptoms and clinical progression to COVID-19 suspicion. A population-based cohort study,"BackgroundEarly identification of different COVID-19 clinical presentations may depict distinct pathophysiological mechanisms and guide management strategies.

ObjectiveTo determine the aggressiveness of SARS-CoV-2 using symptom progression in COVID-19 patients.

DesignHistoric cohort study of Mexican patients. Data from January-April 2020 were provided by the Health Ministry.

SettingPopulation-based. Patients registered in the Epidemiologic Surveillance System in Mexico.

ParticipantsSubjects who sought medical attention for clinical suspicion of COVID-19. All patients were subjected to RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2.

MeasurementsWe measured the Period between initial symptoms and clinical progression to COVID-19 suspicion (PISYCS) and compared it to the primary outcomes (mortality and pneumonia).

Results65,500 patients were included. Reported fatalities and pneumonia were 2176 (3.32%), and 11568 (17.66%), respectively. According to the PISYCS, patients were distributed as follows: 14.89% in <24 hours, 43.25% between 1-3 days, 31.87% between 4-7 days and 9.97% >7 days. The distribution for mortality and pneumonia was 5.2% and 22.5% in <24 hours, 2.5% and 14% between 1-3 days, 3.6% and 19.5% between 4-7 days, 4.1% and 20.6% >7 days, respectively (p<0.001). Adjusted-risk of mortality was (OR [95% CI], p-value): <24 hours= 1.75 [1.55-1.98], p<0.001; 1-3 days= 1 (reference value); 4-7 days= 1.53 [1.37-1.70], p<0.001; >7 days= 1.67 [1.44-1.94], p<0.001. For pneumonia: <24 hours= 1.49 [1.39-1.58], p<0.001; 1-3 days= 1; 4-7 days= 1.48 [1.41-1.56], p<0.001; >7 days= 1.57 [1.46-1.69], p<0.001.

LimitationsUsing a database fed by large numbers of people carries the risk of data inaccuracy. However, this imprecision is expected to be random and data are consistent with previous studies.

ConclusionThe PISYCS shows a U-shaped SARS-CoV-2 aggressiveness pattern.

9713,Nasal-Swab Testing Misses Patients with Low SARS-CoV-2 Viral Loads,"The urgent need for large-scale diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 has prompted pursuit of sample-collection methods of sufficient sensitivity to replace sampling of the nasopharynx (NP). Among these alternatives is collection of nasal-swab samples, which can be performed by the patient, avoiding the need for healthcare personnel and personal protective equipment.

Previous studies have reached opposing conclusions regarding whether nasal sampling is concordant or discordant with NP. To resolve this disagreement, we compared nasal and NP specimens collected by healthcare workers in a cohort consisting of individuals clinically suspected of COVID-19 and outpatients known to be SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive undergoing follow-up. We investigated three different transport conditions, including traditional viral transport media (VTM) and dry swabs, for each of two different nasal-swab collection protocols on a total of 308 study participants, and compared categorical results and Ct values to those from standard NP swabs collected at the same time from the same patients. All testing was performed by RT-PCR on the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 RealTime EUA (limit of detection [LoD], 100 copies viral genomic RNA/mL transport medium). We found high concordance (Cohens kappa >0.8) only for patients with viral loads above 1,000 copies/mL. Those with viral loads below 1,000 copies/mL, the majority in our cohort, exhibited low concordance (Cohens kappa = 0.49); most of these would have been missed by nasal testing alone. Previous reports of high concordance may have resulted from use of assays with higher LoD ([&ge;]1,000 copies/mL). These findings counsel caution in use of nasal testing in healthcare settings and contact-tracing efforts, as opposed to screening of asymptomatic, low-prevalence, low-risk populations. Nasal testing is an adjunct, not a replacement, for NP.","Callahan, C.; Lee, R.; Lee, G.; Zulauf, K. E.; Kirby, J.

22642,Prediction of Mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a statewide health network,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSImportanceC_ST_ABSA predictive model to automatically identify the earliest determinants of both hospital discharge and mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients could be of great assistance to caregivers if the predictive information is generated and made available in the immediate hours following admission.

ObjectiveTo identify the most important predictors of hospital discharge and mortality from measurements at admission for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

DesignObservational cohort study.

SettingElectronic records from hospitalized patients.

ParticipantsPatients admitted between March 3rd and August 24th with COVID-19 in Johns Hopkins Health System hospitals.

Exposures216 phenotypic variables collected within 48 hours of admission.

Main OutcomesWe used age-stratified (<60 and >=60 years) random survival forests with competing risks to identify the most important predictors of death and discharge. Fine-Gray competing risk regression (FGR) models were then constructed based on the most important RSF-derived covariates.

ResultsOf 2212 patients, 1913 were discharged (age 57{+/-}19, time-to-discharge 9{+/-}11 days) while 279 died (age 75{+/-}14, time to death 14{+/-}15 days). Patients >= 60 years were nearly 10 times as likely to die within 60 days of admission as those <60. As the pandemic evolved, the rate of hospital discharge increased in both older and younger patients. Incident death and hospital discharge were accurately predicted by measures of respiratory distress, inflammation, infection, renal function, red cell turn over and cardiac stress. FGR models for each of hospital discharge and mortality as outcomes based on these variables performed well in the older (AUC 0.80-0.85 at 60-days) and younger populations (AUC >0.90 at 60-days).

Conclusions and RelevanceWe identified markers collected within 2 days of admission that predict hospital discharge and mortality in COVID-19 patients and provide prediction models that may be used to guide patient care. Our proposed model suggests that hospital discharge and mortality can be forecasted with high accuracy based on 8-10 variables at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings also point to several specific pathways that could be the focus of future investigations directed at reducing mortality and expediting hospital discharge among COVID-19 patients. Probability of hospital discharge increased over the course of the pandemic.

28176,Digital contact tracing contributes little to COVID-19 outbreak containment,"Digital contact tracing applications have been introduced in many countries to aid in the containment of COVID-19 outbreaks. Initially, enthusiasm was high regarding their implementation as a non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI). Yet, no country was able to prevent larger outbreaks without falling back to harsher NPIs, and the total effect of digital contact tracing remains elusive. Based on the results of empirical studies and modeling efforts, we show that digital contact tracing apps might have prevented cases on the order of single-digit percentages up until now, at best. We show that this poor impact can be attributed to a combination of low participation rates, a non-flexible reliance on symptom-based testing, low engagement of participants, and delays between testing and test result upload. We find that contact tracing does not change the epidemic threshold and exclusively prevents more cases during the supercritical phase of an epidemic, making it unfit as a tool to prevent outbreaks. Locally clustered contact structures may increase the interventions efficacy, but only if the number of contacts per individual is homogeneously distributed, a condition usually not found in contact networks. Our results suggest that policy makers cannot rely on digital contact tracing to contain outbreaks of COVID-19 or similar diseases.","Burdinski, A.; Brockmann, D.; Maier, B.

However, it remains unclear how effectively Covid-19 vaccines prevent people from spreading the virus to their close contacts in real-world circumstances. Here, using nationwide administrative datasets on SARS-CoV-2 infections, vaccination records, demographics, and unique household IDs, we provide evidence about the direct and indirect effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines in reducing infections among vaccinated individuals and their unvaccinated household members. Our estimates for adults imply indirect effectiveness of 8.7% (95% CI: -28.9 to 35.4) two weeks and 42.9% (95% CI: 22.3 to 58.1) 10 weeks after the first dose. We find that the indirect effect of Covid-19 vaccines is smaller and less precise for unvaccinated children aged between 3 to 18 years than for adults. These results provide household-level evidence that vaccines do not only protect vaccinated individuals but provide indirect protection to unvaccinated individuals in a real-world setting.","Salo, J.; Hagg, M.; Kortelainen, M.; Leino, T.; Saxell, T.; Siikanen, M.; Saaksvuori, L.",2021-05-29,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.05.27.21257896,1,Lauri Saaksvuori,Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare and University of Turku,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.27.21257896v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.27.21257896v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
5351,"Relative disease burdens of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza in New York City, February 1 - April 18, 2020.","Comparisons between the mortality burdens of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza often fail to account for the fact that the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports annual influenza mortality estimates which are calculated based upon a series of assumptions about the underreporting of flu deaths. COVID-19 deaths, in contrast, are being reported as raw counts. In this report, we compare COVID-19 death counts to seasonal influenza death counts in New York City during the interval from February 1 - April 18, 2020. Using this approach, COVID-19 appears to have caused 21.4 times the number of deaths as seasonal influenza during the same period. We also assessed excess mortality in order to verify this finding. New York City has had approximately 13,032 excess all-cause mortality deaths during this time period. We assume that most of these deaths are COVID-19 related. We therefore calculated the ratio of excess deaths (i.e. assumed COVID-19 deaths) to seasonal influenza deaths during the same time interval and found a similar ratio of 21.1 COVID-19 to seasonal influenza deaths. Our findings are consistent with conditions on the ground today. Comparing COVID-19 deaths with CDC estimates of yearly influenza-related deaths would suggest that, this year, seasonal influenza has killed approximately the same number of Americans as COVID-19 has. This does not comport with the realities of the pandemic we see today.","Faust, J.; Del Rio, C.",2020-04-27,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.22.20073551,1,Jeremy Faust,"Brigham and Women\'s Hospital, Harvard Medical School",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20073551v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20073551v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
13604,"Knowledge, Practice and associated factors towards the Prevention of COVID-19 among high-risk groups: A cross-sectional study in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","BackgroundCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly transmittable virus that continues to disrupt livelihoods, particularly those of low income segments of society, around the world. In Ethiopia, more specifically in the capital city of Addis Ababa, a sudden increase in the number of confirmed positive cases in high-risk groups of the community has been observed over the last few weeks of the first case. Therefore, this study aims to assess knowledge, practices and associated factors that can contribute to the prevention of COVID-19 among high-risk groups in Addis Ababa.

MethodsA cross-sectional in person survey (n=6007) was conducted from 14-30 April, 2020 following a prioritization within high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. The study area targeted bus stations, public transport drivers, air transport infrastructure, health facilities, public and private pharmacies, hotels, government-owned and private banks, telecom centers, trade centers, orphanages, elderly centers, prison, prisons and selected slum areas where the people live in a crowed. A questionnaire comprised of four sections (demographics, knowledge, practice and reported symptoms) was used for data collection. The outcomes (knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 and practices) were measured using four items. A multi variable logistic regression was applied with adjustment for potential confounding.

ResultsAbout half (48%, 95% CI: 46-49) of the study participants had poor knowledge on the transmission mode of COVID-19 whereas six out of ten (60%, 95% CI: 58-61) had good knowledge on prevention methods for COVID-19. The practice of preventive measures towards COVID-19 was found to be low (49%, 95% CI: 48-50). Factors that influence knowledge on COVID-19 transmission mechanisms were female gender, older age, occupation (health care and grocery worker), lower income and the use of the 8335 free call centre. Older age, occupation (being a health worker), middle income, experience of respiratory illness and religion were significantly associated with being knowledgeable about the prevention methods for COVID-19. The study found that occupation, religion, income, knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 were associated with the practice of precautionary measures towards COVID-19.

ConclusionThe study highlighted that there was moderate knowledge about transmission modes and prevention mechanism.

12119,Chronic Hemodialysis Patients have better outcomes with COVID-19 - a retrospective cohort study,"IntroductionSeveral comorbid conditions, have been identified as risk factors in patients with COVID-19. However, there is a dearth of data describing the impact of COVID-19 infection in patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD-HD).

MethodsThis retrospective case series analyzed 362 adult patients consecutively hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 illness between March 12, 2020 and May 13, 2020, at a teaching hospital in the New York City metropolitan area. Primary outcome was severe pneumonia as defined by the World Health Organization. Secondary outcomes were: 1) the Combined Outcome of Acute respiratory distress syndrome or in-hospital Death (COAD), and 2) the need for High-levels of Oxygen supplementation (HiO2).

ResultsPatients with ESRD-HD had lower odds for poor outcomes including severe pneumonia [Odds Ratio (OR) 0.4, Confidence Interval (CI) (0.2-0.9) p=.04], HiO2 [OR 0.3, CI (0.1- 0.8) p=.02] and COAD [OR 0.4, CI (0.2-1.05) p=.06], when compared to patients without ESRD. In contrast, higher odds for severe pneumonia, COAD and HiO2 were seen with advancing age. African-Americans were over-represented in the hospitalized patient cohort, when compared to their representation in the community (35% vs 18%). Hispanics had higher odds for severe-illness and HiO2 when compared to Caucasians.

ConclusionsPatients with ESRD-HD had a milder course of illness with a lower likelihood of severe pneumonia and a lesser need for aggressive oxygen supplementation when compared to patients not on chronic dialysis. This """"protective effect"""" might have a pathophysiologic basis and needs to be further explored.","Naaraayan, A.; Nimkar, A.; Hasan, A.; Pant, S.; Durdevic, M.; Elenius, H.; Nava Suarez, C.; Basak, P.; Lakshmi, K.; Mandel, M.; Jesmajian, S.",2020-07-24,Nephrology,10.1101/2020.07.22.20159202,1,Ashutossh Naaraayan,Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159202v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159202v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
18993,Predictors of QT Interval Prolongation in Critically-ill Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection Treated with Hydroxychloroquine,"BackgroundHydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been described as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there are safety concerns regarding its QT interval and pro-arrhythmic effects.

ObjectiveThis trial aimed to determine the predictors of QT interval prolongation and pro-arrhythmic effects in patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection and receiving HCQ.

MethodsWe performed a retrospective observational study of 45 critically-ill patients hospitalized because of SARS-CoV-2 infection and treated with 800 mg of HCQ at day 1 and 400 mg on days 2-5. Clinical aspects and outcomes, basal and final corrected QT (QTc) interval, and the incidence of arrhythmias and arrhythmogenic death were observed. Independent predictors of QTc prolongation were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis. QT interval prolongation was considered substantial at final QTc [&ge;] 480 ms.

ResultsThe mean age was 60.9 {+/-} 16.67 years and 28 (62.2%) patients were men. Basal QTc was 442 {+/-} 28 ms, and the final QTc interval was 458 {+/-} 34 ms, for a mean QTc interval variation of 15 {+/-} 11 ms. There was no arrhythmogenic death. The need for hemodialysis remained a statistically significant predictor of QT interval enlargement (odds ratio, 10.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 - 102.18; p = 0.045).

ConclusionsHCQ promotes mild to moderate QT interval prolongation. The risk of QT interval prolongation is higher among patients with acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis.","Scuotto, F.; Marra, R.; Almeida, L. L. D.; Soares, M. S. R.; Silva, G. K.; Paul, L.

5880,Response strategies for COVID-19 epidemics in African settings: a mathematical modelling study,"BackgroundThe health impact of COVID-19 may differ in African settings as compared to countries in Europe or China due to demographic, epidemiological, environmental and socio-economic factors. We evaluated strategies to reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden in African countries, so as to support decisions that balance minimising mortality, protecting health services and safeguarding livelihoods.

MethodsWe used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered mathematical model, stratified by age, to predict the evolution of COVID-19 epidemics in three countries representing a range of age distributions in Africa (from oldest to youngest average age: Mauritius, Nigeria and Niger), under various effectiveness assumptions for combinations of different non-pharmaceutical interventions: self-isolation of symptomatic people, physical distancing, and  shielding (physical isolation) of the high-risk population. We adapted model parameters to better represent uncertainty about what might be expected in African populations, in particular by shifting the distribution of severity risk towards younger ages and increasing the case-fatality ratio.

ResultsWe predicted median clinical attack rates over the first 12 months of 17% (Niger) to 39% (Mauritius), peaking at 2-4 months, if epidemics were unmitigated. Self-isolation while symptomatic had a maximum impact of about 30% on reducing severe cases, while the impact of physical distancing varied widely depending on percent contact reduction and R0. The effect of shielding high-risk people, e.g. by rehousing them in physical isolation, was sensitive mainly to residual contact with low-risk people, and to a lesser extent to contact among shielded individuals. Response strategies incorporating self-isolation of symptomatic individuals, moderate physical distancing and high uptake of shielding reduced predicted peak bed demand by 46% to 54% and mortality by 60% to 75%. Lockdowns delayed epidemics by about 3 months. Estimates were sensitive to differences in age-specific social mixing patterns, as published in the literature.

DiscussionIn African settings, as elsewhere, current evidence suggests large COVID-19 epidemics are expected. However, African countries have fewer means to suppress transmission and manage cases. We found that self-isolation of symptomatic persons and general physical distancing are unlikely to avert very large epidemics, unless distancing takes the form of stringent lockdown measures. However, both interventions help to mitigate the epidemic. Shielding of high-risk individuals can reduce health service demand and, even more markedly, mortality if it features high uptake and low contact of shielded and unshielded people, with no increase in contact among shielded people. Strategies combining self-isolation, moderate physical distancing and shielding will probably achieve substantial reductions in mortality in African countries. Temporary lockdowns, where socioeconomically acceptable, can help gain crucial time for planning and expanding health service capacity.","Van Zandvoort, K.; Jarvis, C. I.; Pearson, C.; Davies, N.

1709,The effect of travel restrictions on the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak,"Motivated by the rapid spread of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Mainland China, we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of both domestic and international travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic. The model is calibrated on the evidence of internationally imported cases before the implementation of the travel quarantine of Wuhan. By assuming a generation time of 7.5 days, the reproduction number is estimated to be 2.4 [90% CI 2.2-2.6]. The median estimate for number of cases before the travel ban implementation on January 23, 2020 is 58,956 [90% CI 40,759 - 87,471] in Wuhan and 3,491 [90% CI 1,924 - 7,360] in other locations in Mainland China. The model shows that as of January 23, most Chinese cities had already received a considerable number of infected cases, and the travel quarantine delays the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days. The travel quarantine has a more marked effect at the international scale, where we estimate the number of case importations to be reduced by 80% until the end of February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.","Chinazzi, M.; Davis, J.

16408,"COVID-19, Type-2 Diabetes, and Associated Health Outcomes in China: Results from a Nationwide Survey of 10,545 Adults","ObjectiveThis study examined the associations between type-2 diabetes (T2DM) and self-reported/familial COVID-19 infection and investigated health-related outcomes among those with diabetes during Chinas nationwide quarantine.

MethodsThe 2020 China COVID-19 Survey was administered anonymously via social media (WeChat) across China. It was completed by 10,545 adults in all of mainland Chinas 31 provinces. The survey consisted of 74 items covering sociodemographic characteristics, preventive measures for COVID-19, lifestyle behaviors, and health-related outcomes during the period of quarantine. Regression models examined associations among study variables, adjusting for covariates.

ResultsDiabetes was associated with a six-fold increased risk of reporting COVID-19 infection among respondents or their family members. Among patients with diabetes, individuals who rarely wore masks had double the risk of suspected COVID-19 infection compared with those who always wore masks, with an inverse J-shaped relationship between face mask wearing and suspected COVID-19 infection. People with T2DM tended to have both poor knowledge of COVID-19 and poor compliance with preventive measures, despite perceiving a high risk of personal infection (40.0% among respondents reporting T2DM and 8.0% without T2DM). Only 54-55% of these respondents claimed to consistently practice preventive measures, including wearing face masks. Almost 60% of those with T2DM experienced food or medication shortages during the quarantine period, which was much higher than those without T2DM. Importantly, respondents who experienced medication shortages reported a 63% higher COVID-19 infection rate.

ConclusionsT2DM was associated with an increased risk of self-reported personal and family member COVID-19 infection, which is mitigated by consistent use of face masks.

FundingThe project is supported in part by research grants from the China Medical Board (Grant number: 16-262), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant Number: 2017YFC0907200 & 2017YFC0907201), the University Alliance of the Silk Road (Grant number: 2020LMZX002), and Xian Jiaotong University Global Health Institute.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become increasingly clear that the risk factors for initial infection and subsequent poor health outcomes include, but are not limited to, social vulnerability, economic status, older age, and obesity. While community-wide masking has been recommended by the World Health Organization to control COVID-19, its overall effectiveness has not been clearly evaluated.

Added value of this studyThrough an anonymous survey disseminated and promoted through WeChat, the largest social media platform in China, we sought to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the health, wellbeing, and health-related behaviors of adults in China. Specifically, this study examined how individuals with chronic diseases managed the threat, including their COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes, and adherence to preventive measures such as wearing face masks, and their disease-related self-care.

Implications of the available evidenceThis study demonstrates that type-2 diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection, which is mitigated by consistent use of face masks.","Shi, Z.; Yan, A.; Zimmet, P.; Sun, X.; Do Vale Moreira, N.

27045,Behaviour of smokers and their influencers in the UK during COVID-19 pandemic,"PurposeThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented circumstances and changes in behaviour. This research sought to better understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and lockdown, on smoking behaviour in the UK from the perspectives of consumers (current and former smokers) and some of their smoking-related behaviour-influencers.

Design/methodology/approachThis research project encompassed two surveys, one for current and former smokers (Consumers) and one for those individuals in professions with the potential to influence smoking behaviours (Influencers). Both surveys were conducted online and were infield for approximately two weeks during UKs first COVID-19 lockdown. Because of the unprecedented times the society was experiencing, several questions relating directly to COVID-19 were added to the survey and this paper is based only on findings only from those questions and not the whole project. The results were analysed descriptively.

FindingsA total of 954 consumers and 1027 influencers participated in the surveys. Increased smoking was reported by 67% of the consumers mainly due to stress and boredom arising out of COVID-19 lockdown. Consumers under 45 years of age, those in professional and managerial occupations, and among dual users reported increased smoking in lockdown. The COVID-19 situation changed the plans to quit smoking in 36% of consumers, with only 6% deciding to quit. Only 40% of healthcare professionals (HCPs) documented patient smoking status in over half their interactions.

Originality/ valueThis research among current and former smokers and their influencers highlights important changes in behaviour during the COVID-19 times and underscores urgent measures to be taken by HCPs and policymakers for staying on course of achieving smokefree goals despite challenges posed by COVID-19.","Patwardhan, S.

10449,COVID-19 related concerns of people with long-term respiratory conditions: A qualitative study,"BACKGROUNDThe COVID-19 pandemic is having profound psychological impacts on populations globally, with increasing levels of stress, anxiety, and depression being reported, especially in people with pre- existing medical conditions who appear to be particularly vulnerable. There are limited data on the specific concerns people have about COVID-19 and what these are based on.

METHODSThe aim of this study was to identify and explore the concerns of people with long-term respiratory conditions in the UK regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and how these concerns were affecting them. We conducted a thematic analysis of free text responses to the question """"What are your main concerns about getting coronavirus?"""", which was included in the British Lung Foundation/Asthma UK (BLF-AUK) partnership COVID-19 survey, conducted between the 1st and 8th of April. This was during the 3rd week of the UKs initial social distancing measures.

RESULTS7,039 responses were analysed, with respondents from a wide range of ages, gender, and all UK nations. Respondents reported having asthma (85%), COPD (9%), bronchiectasis (4%), interstitial lung disease (2%), or  other lung diseases (e.g. lung cancer) (1%). Four main themes were identified: 1) vulnerability to COVID-19; 2) anticipated experience of contracting COVID-19; 3) wide-reaching uncertainty; and 4) inadequate national response.

CONCLUSIONSThe COVID-19 pandemic is having profound psychological impacts. The concerns we identified largely reflect objective, as well as subjective, aspects of the current situation. Hence, key approaches to reducing these concerns require changes to the reality of their situation, and are likely to include i) helping people optimise their health, limit risk of infection, and access necessities; ii) minimising the negative experience of disease where possible, iii) providing up-to-date, accurate and consistent information, iv) improving the government and healthcare response.","Philip, K.

Here we developed an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within a childcare center and households. Scenarios varied the student-to-educator ratio (15:2, 8:2, 7:3), and family clustering (siblings together vs. random assignment). We also evaluated a primary school setting (30:1, 15:1 and 8:1) including cohorts that alternate weekly. In the childcare scenarios, grouping siblings significantly reduced outbreak size and student-days lost. We identify an intensification cascade specific to classroom outbreaks of respiratory viruses with presymptomatic infection. In both childcare and primary school settings, each doubling of class size from 8 to 15 to 30 more than doubled the outbreak size and student-days lost, by factors of 2-5, respectively 2.5-4.5, depending on the scenario. Proposals for childcare and primary school reopening could be enhanced for safety by switching to lower ratios and sibling groupings.","Phillips, B.; Browne, D.; Anand, M.; Bauch, C.",2020-08-16,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.07.20170407,2,Chris Bauch,University of Waterloo,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.20170407v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.20170407v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1038/s41598-021-85302-6
23158,Seasonal pattern COVID-19 and Flu-Like Illnesses comparable,"BackgroundDuring the first wave of COVID-19 it was hypothesized that COVID-19 is subject to multi-wave seasonality, similar to Influenza-Like Illnesses since time immemorial. One year into the pandemic, we aimed to test the seasonality hypothesis for COVID-19.

MethodsWe calculated the average annual time-series for Influenza-Like Illnesses based on incidence data from 2016 till 2019 in the Netherlands, and compared these with two COVID-19 time-series during 2020/2021 for the Netherlands. We plotted the time-series on a standardized logarithmic infection scale. Finally, we calculated correlation coefficients and used univariate regression analysis to estimate the strength of the association between the time-series of COVID-19 and Influenza-Like Illnesses.

ResultsThe time-series for COVID-19 and Influenza-Like Illnesses were strongly and highly significantly correlated. The COVID-19 peaks were all during flu season, and lows were all in the opposing period. Finally, COVID-19 meets the multi-wave characteristics of earlier flu-like pandemics, namely a short first wave at the tail-end of a flu season, and a longer and more intense second wave during the subsequent flu season.

ConclusionsWe conclude that seasonal patterns of COVID-19 incidence and Influenza-Like Illnesses incidence are highly similar, in a country in the temperate climate zone, such as the Netherlands. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic satisfies the criteria of earlier respiratory pandemics, namely a first wave that is short-lived at the tail-end of flu season, and a second wave that is longer and more severe.

This seems to imply that the same factors that are driving the seasonality of Influenza-Like Illnesses are causing COVID-19 seasonality as well, such as solar radiation (UV), temperature, relative humidity, and subsequently seasonal allergens and allergies.

HIGHLIGHTSO_LITime-series analysis shows that COVID-19 and historic of Influenza-Like illnesses have highly similar seasonal patterns in the Netherlands.
C_LIO_LICOVID-19 satisfies the criteria of earlier flu-like pandemics, namely a short cycle at the end of flu season, and a longer, more intense cycle during the subsequent flu season.
C_LIO_LIThe implication is that the seasonal factors driving flu season, are also responsible for COVID-19 seasonality.
C_LIO_LIWe developed and applied a new method to determine seasonality, encompassing comparative time-series analysis, a standardized logarithmic infection scale, and qualitative seasonality criteria.

17129,"Emergency Response for Evaluating SARS-CoV-2 Immune Status, Seroprevalence and Convalescent Plasma in Argentina","We report the emergency development and application of a robust serologic test to evaluate acute and convalescent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in Argentina. The assays, COVIDAR IgG and IgM, which were produced and provided for free to health authorities, private and public health institutions and nursing homes, use a combination of a trimer stabilized spike protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD) in a single enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate. Over half million tests have already been distributed to detect and quantify antibodies for multiple purposes, including assessment of immune responses in hospitalized patients and large seroprevalence studies in neighborhoods, slums and health care workers, which resulted in a powerful tool for asymptomatic detection and policy making in the country. Analysis of antibody levels and longitudinal studies of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in over one thousand patient samples provided insightful information about IgM and IgG seroconversion time and kinetics, and IgM waning profiles. At least 35% of patients showed seroconversion within 7 days, and 95% within 45 days of symptoms onset, with simultaneous or close sequential IgM and IgG detection. Longitudinal studies of asymptomatic cases showed a wide range of antibody responses with median levels below those observed in symptomatic patients. Regarding convalescent plasma applications, a protocol was standardized for the assessment of end point IgG antibody titers with COVIDAR with more than 500 plasma donors. The protocol showed a positive correlation with neutralizing antibody titers, and was used to assess antibody titers for clinical trials and therapies across the country. Here, we demonstrate the importance of providing a robust and specific serologic assay for generating new information about antibody kinetics in infected individuals and mitigation policies to cope with pandemic needs.

AUTHOR SUMMARYThe development of robust and specific serologic assays to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understand the pandemic evolution and to stablish mitigation strategies. Here, we report the emergency development, production and application of a versatile ELISA test for detecting antibodies against the whole spike protein and its receptor binding domain. Over half million tests have been freely distributed in public and private health institutions of Argentina for evaluating immune responses, convalescent plasma programs and for large seroprevalence studies in neighborhoods and health care workers. We are still learning how and when to use serologic testing in different epidemiological settings. This program allowed us to produce large amount of high quality data on antibody levels in symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and generate relevant information about IgM and IgG seroconversion time and kinetics. We also present standardized protocols for antibody quantification as guidance for convalescent donor plasma selection in hospitals throughout the country for compassionate use and clinical trials. Here, we provide a framework for generating widely available tools, protocols and information of antibody responses for pandemic management.","Ojeda, D.; Gonzalez Lopez Ledesma, M.

27948,App-based COVID-19 surveillance and prediction: The COVID Symptom Study Sweden,"BackgroundThe response of the Swedish authorities to the COVID-19 pandemic was less restrictive than in most countries during the first year, with infection and death rates substantially higher than in neighbouring Nordic countries. Because access to PCR testing was limited during the first wave (February to June 2020) and regional data were reported with delay, adequate monitoring of community disease spread was hampered. The app-based COVID Symptom Study was launched in Sweden to disseminate real-time estimates of disease spread and to collect prospective data for research. The aim of this study was to describe the research project, develop models for estimation of COVID-19 prevalence and to evaluate it for prediction of hospital admissions for COVID-19.

MethodsWe enrolled 143 531 study participants ([&ge;]18 years) throughout Sweden, who contributed 10{middle dot}6 million daily symptom reports between April 29, 2020 and February 10, 2021. Data from 19 161 self-reported PCR tests were used to create a symptom-based algorithm to estimate daily prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19. The prediction model was validated using external datasets. We further utilized the model estimates to forecast subsequent new hospital admissions.

FindingsA prediction model for symptomatic COVID-19 based on 17 symptoms, age, and sex yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0{middle dot}78 (95% CI 0{middle dot}74-0{middle dot}83) in an external validation dataset of 943 PCR-tested symptomatic individuals. App-based surveillance proved particularly useful for predicting hospital trends in times of insufficient testing capacity and registration delays. During the first wave, our prediction model estimates demonstrated a lower mean error (0{middle dot}38 average new daily hospitalizations per 100 000 inhabitants per week (95% CI 0{middle dot}32, 0{middle dot}45)) for subsequent hospitalizations in the ten most populated counties, than a model based on confirmed case data (0{middle dot}72 (0{middle dot}64, 0{middle dot}81)). The model further correctly identified on average three out of five counties (95% CI 2{middle dot}3, 3{middle dot}7) with the highest rates of hospitalizations the following week during the first wave and four out of five (3{middle dot}0, 4{middle dot}6) during the second wave.

InterpretationThe experience of the COVID Symptom Study highlights the important role citizens can play in real-time monitoring of infectious diseases, and how app-based data collection may be used for data-driven rapid responses to public health challenges.

5267,Knowledge and Beliefs of General Public of India on COVID-19: A Web-based Cross-sectional Survey,"ContextDespite many awareness programs conducted by the governments and other agencies, there are certain false beliefs among the general public of India towards the transmission, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19.

AimsTo assess the knowledge and beliefs of the general public of India on COVID-19.

Materials and MethodsA web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between 20th March and 15th April 2020. A 17-item questionnaire was developed, validated, and used for the study. The questionnaire was randomly distributed among the public using Google forms through social media networks. Descriptive analysis was performed to represent the study characteristics, Chi-square test for assessing the associations among the study variables, and logistic regression analysis for identifying the factors influencing the beliefs.

ResultsA total of 462 participants with a mean (SD) age of 30.66 (11.31) years were responded to the questionnaire. Study participants are having fairly good knowledge of the basic aspects of COVID-19. However, a considerable fraction of participants were having false beliefs towards the transmission of new coronavirus, and prevention & treatment of COVID-19. It was observed that the participants who were aged 31-60 years and >60 years, education level of intermediate or diploma and high school certificate, and occupation as the unskilled workers had more of false beliefs towards COVID-19 compared to their counterparts.

ConclusionThough the overall knowledge on COVID-19 was good enough among the general public of India, still there is a need for education to avoid false beliefs especially among the people who are elderly, having a low level of education, and non-professional workers.

26202,Preliminary Analysis of Safety and Immunogenicity of a SARS-CoV-2 Variant Vaccine Booster,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has led to more than 3 million deaths worldwide. Safe and effective vaccines are now available, including the mRNA-1273 prototype vaccine, which encodes for the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein stabilized in the prefusion conformation by 2 proline substitutions. This vaccine showed 94% efficacy in prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 disease in a phase 3 clinical study. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged, some of which have shown decreased susceptibility to neutralization by vaccine-induced antibody, most notably the B.1.351 variant, although the overall impact on vaccine efficacy remains to be determined. In addition, recent evidence of waning antibody levels after infection or vaccination point to the need for periodic boosting of immunity. Here we present the preliminary evaluation of a clinical study on the use of the prototype mRNA-1273 or modified COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, designed to target emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants as booster vaccines in participants previously vaccinated approximately 6 months earlier with two doses of the prototype vaccine, mRNA-1273. The modified vaccines include a monovalent mRNA-1273.351 encoding for the S protein found in the B.1.351 variant and multivalent mRNA-1273.211 comprising a 1:1 mix of mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351. As single 50 {micro}g booster vaccinations, both mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351 had acceptable safety profiles and were immunogenic. Antibody neutralization titers against B.1.351 and P.1 variants measured by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) assays before the booster vaccinations, approximately 6 to 8 months after the primary series, were low or below the assay limit of quantification, although geometric mean titers versus the wild-type strain remained above levels likely to be protective. Two weeks after the booster vaccinations, titers against the wild-type original strain, B.1.351, and P.1 variants increased to levels similar to or higher than peak titers after the primary series vaccinations. Although both mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351 boosted neutralization of the wild-type original strain, and B.1.351 and P.1 variants, mRNA-1273.351 appeared to be more effective at increasing neutralization of the B.1.351 virus versus a boost with mRNA-1273. The vaccine trial is ongoing and boosting of clinical trial participants with the multivalent mRNA-1273.211 is currently being evaluated.","Wu, K.; Choi, A.; Koch, M.; Ma, L.; Hill, A.; Nunna, N.; Huang, W.; Oestreicher, J.; Colpitts, T.; Bennett, H.; Legault, H.; Paila, Y.; Nestorova, B.; Ding, B.; Pajon, R.; Miller, J.; Leav, B.; Carfi, A.; Mcphee, R.; Edwards, D.",2021-05-06,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.05.05.21256716,1,Roderick Mcphee,"Moderna, Inc.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.05.21256716v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.05.21256716v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
12262,The Epidemiology Workbench: a Tool for Communities to Strategize in Response to COVID-19 and other Infectious Diseases,"COVID-19 poses a dramatic challenge to health, community life, and the economy of communities across the world. While the properties of the virus are similar from place to place, the impact has been dramatically different from place to place, due to such factors as population density, mobility, age distribution, etc. Thus, optimum testing and social distancing strategies may also be different from place to place. The Epidemiology Workbench provides access to an agent-based model in which a communitys demographic, geographic, and public health information together with a social distancing and testing strategy may be input, and a range of possible outcomes computed, to inform local authorities on coping strategies. The model is adaptable to other infectious diseases, and to other strains of coronavirus. The tool is illustrated by scenarios for the cities of Urbana and Champaign, Illinois, the home of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Our calculations suggest that massive testing is the most effective strategy to combat the likely increase in local cases due to mass ingress of a student population carrying a higher viral load than that currently present in the community.","Nunez-Corrales, S.; Jakobsson, E.",2020-08-05,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.22.20159798,2,Santiago Núñez-Corrales,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159798v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159798v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,"NA"
9925,Prevalence of Chemosensory Dysfunction in COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Reveals Significant Ethnic Differences,"A significant fraction of people who test positive for COVID-19 have chemosensory deficits. However, the reported prevalence of these deficits in smell and/or taste varies widely, and the reason for the differences between studies is unclear. We determined the pooled prevalence of such chemosensory deficits in a systematic review. We searched the COVID-19 portfolio of the National Institutes of Health for all studies that reported the prevalence of smell and/or taste deficits in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Forty-two studies reporting on 23,353 patients qualified and were subjected to a systematic review and meta-analysis. Estimated random prevalence of olfactory dysfunction was 38.5%, of taste dysfunction was 30.4% and of overall chemosensory dysfunction was 50.2%. We examined the effects of age, disease severity, and ethnicity on chemosensory dysfunction. The effect of age did not reach significance, but anosmia/hypogeusia decreased with disease severity, and ethnicity was highly significant: Caucasians had a 3-6 times higher prevalence of chemosensory deficits than East Asians. The finding of ethnic differences points to genetic, ethnicity-specific differences of the virus-binding entry proteins in the olfactory epithelium and taste buds as the most likely explanation, with major implications for infectivity, diagnosis and management of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Von Bartheld, C.

10910,Rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection by multicapillary column coupled ion mobility spectrometry (MCC-IMS) of breath. A proof of concept study,"There is an urgent need for screening of patients having a communicable viral disease to cut infection chains.

We could recently demonstrate that MCC-IMS of breath is able to identify Influenza-A infected patients. With decreasing Influenza epidemic and upcoming SARS-CoV-2 infections we went on and also analysed patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections.

75 patients, 34m, 41f, aged 64.4 {+/-} 15.4 years, 14 positive for Influenza-A, 16 positive for SARS-CoV-2, the remaining 44 patients were used as controls. In one patient RT-PCR was highly suspicious of SARS-CoV-2 but initially inconclusive.

Besides RT-PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs all patients underwent MCC-IMS analysis of breath. There was no difference in gender or age according to the groups.

97.3% of the patients could be correctly classified to the respective group by discriminant analysis. Even the inconclusive patient could be mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 group applying the discrimination function.

ConclusionMCC-IMS is able to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection and Influenza-A infection in breath. As this method provides exact, fast non-invasive diagnosis it should be further developed for screening of communicable viral diseases.

27981,"Efficacy of Proxalutamide in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Design Clinical Trial","BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity is mediated by the androgen-promoted protease, transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Previously, we have shown that treatment with proxalutamide, a non-steroidal androgen receptor antagonist, accelerates viral clearance and clinical remission in outpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) compared to placebo. The effects in hospitalized COVID-19 patients were unknown.

MethodsMen and women hospitalized but not requiring mechanical ventilation were randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive 300 mg of proxalutamide per day or placebo for 14 days. The study was conducted at eight sites in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. The primary outcome measure was the clinical status (8-point ordinal scale) at 14-days post-randomization. The primary efficacy endpoint was the 14-day recovery ratio (alive hospital discharge [scores 1, 2]).

FindingsA total of 645 patients were randomized (317 received proxalutamide, 328 placebo) and underwent intention-to-treat analysis. The 14-day median ordinal scale score in the proxalutamide group was 1 (interquartile range [IQR]=1-2) versus 7 (IQR=2-8) for placebo, P<0.001. The 14-day recovery rate was 81.4% for proxalutamide and 35.7% for placebo (recovery ratio, 2.28; 95% CI 1.95-2.66 [P<0.001]). The 28-day all-cause mortality rate was 11.0% for proxalutamide versus 49.4% for placebo (hazard ratio, 0.16; 95% CI 0.11-0.24). The median post-randomization time to recovery was 5 days (IQR=3- 8) for proxalutamide versus 10 days (IQR=6-15) for placebo.

InterpretationHospitalized COVID-19 patients not requiring mechanical ventilation receiving proxalutamide had a 128% higher recovery rate than those treated with placebo. All-cause mortality was reduced by 77.7% over 28 days. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04728802).","Cadegiani, F. A.; Fonseca, D. N.; Mccoy, J.; Zimerman, R. A.; Mirza, F. N.; Correia, M.

MethodsBetween May 29 and July 2, 2020, a retrospective cohort study was conducted among two populations: requisitioned health-care workers and requisitioned staff from hospitals childcare centers, to investigate the virus circulation during lockdown, in a French area of high transmission.

ResultsThe infection attack rate was 6/52 (11.6%) and 8/46 (17.4%) among health-care workers and childcare staff, respectively. An early epidemic occurred among Montreuil s hospital childcare staff, but the parents were not affected (p=0.029). Among Aulnay-sous-bois childcare center, three staff members were infected but none of them was in charge of a child whose parents were infected. Also among the parents of the children they cared for, none developed antibodies. Out of 14 infections, 12 were reliable to a source of transmission, mostly among colleagues.

2966,"Meplazumab treats COVID-19 pneumonia: an open-labelled, concurrent controlled add-on clinical trial","BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 is a novel human coronavirus, there is no specific antiviral drugs. It has been proved that host-cell-expressed CD147 could bind spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and involve in host cell invasion. Antibody against CD147 could block the infection of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of meplazumab, a humanized anti-CD147 antibody, as add-on therapy in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

MethodsAll patients received recommended strategy from Diagnosis and Treatment for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Diseases released by National Health Commission of China. Eligible patients were add-on administered 10 mg meplazumab intravenously at days 1, 2, and 5. Patients hospitalized in the same period were observed as concurrent control. The endpoints include virological clearance rate, case severity, chest radiographic, and laboratory test. This trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of Institution at the Tangdu hospital, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT 04275245.

Findings17 patients were enrolled and assigned to meplazumab group between Feb 3, 2020 and Feb 10, 2020. 11 hospitalized patients served as concurrent control. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced across two groups. Compared to control group, meplazumab treatment significantly improved the discharged (p=0.006) and case severity (p=0.021) in critical and severe patients. The time to virus negative in meplazumab group was reduced than that in control group (median 3, 95%CI[1.5-4.5] vs. 13, [6.5-19.5]; p=0.014, HR=0.37, 95%CI[0.155-0.833]). The percentages of patients recovered to the normal lymphocyte count and CRP concentration were also increased remarkably and rapidly in meplazumab group. No adverse effect was found in meplazumab-treated patients.

InterpretationMeplazumab efficiently improved the recovery of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with a favorable safety profile. Our results support to carry out a large-scale investigation of meplazumab as a treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia.

This study evaluated the analytical performance of the newly developed rapid molecular assays GENECUBE(R) HQ SARS-CoV-2 and the GENECUBE(R) FLU A/B.

MethodThis prospective study was conducted between December 14, 2020, and January 9, 2021, at a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) center. Samples were collected from the nasopharynx with flocked swabs. Molecular tests were performed with the GENECUBE(R) system and reference reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and the results of the two assays were compared.

ResultAmong 1065 samples, 81 (7.6%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the reference RT-PCR. Three showed discordance between GENECUBE(R) HQ SARS-CoV-2 and the reference RT-PCR; the total, positive and negative samples of concordance for the two assays were 99.7%, 100%, and 99.7%, respectively. All discordant cases were positive for GENECUBE(R) HQ SARS-CoV-2 and negative for the reference RT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 was detected from all three samples by another molecular assay for SARS-CoV-2. For the GENECUBE(R) FLU A/B, the total, positive and negative samples of concordance for the two assays were 99.5%, 100%, and 99.1%.

ConclusionThe GENECUBE(R) HQ SARS-CoV-2 and GENECUBE(R) FLU A/B demonstrated sufficient analytical performance to detect SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus A/B.

Key pointsWe prospectively evaluated the analytical performance of the newly developed rapid molecular assays GENECUBE(R) HQ SARS-CoV-2 and the GENECUBE(R) FLU A/B. The two assays showed >99% concordance rate compared with a reference PCR, which indicated their sufficient analytical performance to detect SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus A/B.","Kiyasu, Y.; Akashi, Y.; Sugiyama, A.; Takeuchi, Y.; Notake, S.; Naito, A.; Nakamura, K.; Ishikawa, H.; Suzuki, H.",2021-02-25,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.02.24.21252337,1,Yusaku Akashi Dr.,"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Tsukuba Medical Center Hospital",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.24.21252337v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.24.21252337v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1007/s40291-021-00535-5
19747,Clinical and Virological Characteristics of Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients in a German Tertiary Care Center during the First Wave of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,"BackgroundAdequate patient allocation is pivotal for optimal resource management in strained healthcare systems, and requires detailed knowledge of clinical and virological disease trajectories.

MethodsA cohort of 168 hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients enrolled in a prospective observational study at a large European tertiary care center was analyzed.

ResultsForty-four percent (71/161) of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Shorter duration of symptoms before admission (aOR 1.22 per day less, 95%CI 1.10-1.37, p<0.01), age 60-69 as compared to 18-59 years (aOR 4.33, 95%CI 1.07-20.10, p=0.04), and history of hypertension (aOR 5.55, 95%CI 2.00-16.82, p<0.01) were associated with need for IMV. Patients on IMV had higher maximal concentrations, slower decline rates, and longer shedding of SARS-CoV-2 than non-IMV patients (33 days, IQR 26-46.75, vs 18 days, IQR 16-46.75, respectively, p<0.01). Median duration of hospitalization was 9 days (IQR 6-15.5) for non-IMV and 49.5 days (IQR 36.8-82.5) for IMV-patients.

ConclusionOur results indicate a short duration of symptoms before admission as a risk factor for severe disease and different viral load kinetics in severely affected patients.","Thibeault, C.; Muehlemann, B.; Helbig, E.

16615,Gargle-Direct: Extraction-Free Detection of SARS-CoV-2 using Real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) of Saline Gargle Rinse Samples,"BackgroundSaline mouth rinse/gargle samples have recently been shown to be a suitable option for swab-independent self-collection for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. We sought to evaluate a simplified process for direct reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) testing of this novel sample type and to compare performance with routine RT-qPCR using automated nucleic acid extraction.

MethodsClinical saline mouth rinse/gargle samples were subjected to automated nucleic acid extraction (""""standard method""""), followed by RT-qPCR using three assays including the FDA authorized US-CDCs N1/N2 assay, which was the reference standard for determining sensitivity/specificity. For extraction-free workflow, an aliquot of each gargle sample underwent viral heat inactivation at 65 {degrees}C for 20 minutes followed by RT-qPCR testing, without an intermediate extraction step. An in-house validated RT-qPCR lab developed test (LDT), targeting the SARS-CoV-2s S/ORF8 genes (SORP triplex assay) and the N1/N2 US-CDC assay was used to evaluate the extraction-free protocol. To improve the analytical sensitivity, we developed a single-tube hemi-nested (STHN) version of the SORP triplex assay.

ResultsA total of 38 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 75 negative saline mouth rinse/gargle samples were included in this evaluation. A 100% concordance in detection rate was obtained between the standard method and the extraction-free approach for the SORP assay. An average increase of +2.63 to +5.74 of the cycle threshold (CT) values was observed for both the SORP and N1/N2 assay when extraction-free was compared between the standard method. The average {Delta}CT [{Delta}CT=CT(Direct PCR)-CT(Extracted RNA)], for each of the gene targets were: S ({Delta}CT= +4.24), ORF8 ({Delta}CT=+2.63), N1 ({Delta}CT=+2.74) and N2 ({Delta}CT=+5.74). The {Delta}CT for the STHN SORP assay was +1.51 and -2.05 for the S and ORF8 targets respectively, when extracted method was compared to the standard method.

ConclusionOur Gargle-Direct SARS-CoV-2 method is operationally simple, minimizes pre-analytical sample processing and is potentially implementable by most molecular diagnostic laboratories. The empirical demonstration of single-tube hemi-nested RT-qPCR, to specifically address and alleviate the widely-acknowledged problem of reduced analytical sensitivity of detection of extraction-free templates, should help diagnostic laboratories in choosing Gargle-Direct protocol for high-throughput testing.","Tilley, P.; Gadkar, V.; Goldfarb, D.

12377,The best COVID-19 predictor is recent smell loss:a cross-sectional study,"BackgroundCOVID-19 has heterogeneous manifestations, though one of the most common symptoms is a sudden loss of smell (anosmia or hyposmia). We investigated whether olfactory loss is a reliable predictor of COVID-19.

MethodsThis preregistered, cross-sectional study used a crowdsourced questionnaire in 23 languages to assess symptoms in individuals self-reporting recent respiratory illness. We quantified changes in chemosensory abilities during the course of the respiratory illness using 0-100 visual analog scales (VAS) for participants reporting a positive (C19+; n=4148) or negative (C19-; n=546) COVID-19 laboratory test outcome. Logistic regression models identified singular and cumulative predictors of COVID-19 status and post-COVID-19 olfactory recovery.

ResultsBoth C19+ and C19-groups exhibited smell loss, but it was significantly larger in C19+ participants (mean{+/-}SD, C19+: -82.5{+/-}27.2 points; C19-: -59.8{+/-}37.7). Smell loss during illness was the best predictor of COVID-19 in both single and cumulative feature models (ROC AUC=0.72), with additional features providing negligible model improvement. VAS ratings of smell loss were more predictive than binary chemosensory yes/no-questions or other cardinal symptoms, such as fever or cough. Olfactory recovery within 40 days was reported for [~]50% of participants and was best predicted by time since illness onset.

ConclusionsAs smell loss is the best predictor of COVID-19, we developed the ODoR-19 tool, a 0-10 scale to screen for recent olfactory loss. Numeric ratings [&le;]2 indicate high odds of symptomatic COVID-19 (4<OR<10), which can be deployed when viral lab tests are impractical or unavailable.","Gerkin, R. C.; Ohla, K.; Veldhuizen, M.

9643,How far Covid19 virus spread can be curbed byrelaxing lockdown in different stages? -A study inIndian scenario,"After the emergence of the first cases in Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has rapidly spread out to other provinces, neighboring countries and finally has become a global terror. It is indeed a matter of serious concern to study the transmission dynamics of this virus. The potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity can be well understood by the unknown basic reproduction number. A stochastic model can be used to estimate this number with possible safeguard on uncertainties. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV infection and how long they should be maintained. A short-term forecast of incidences are often of high priority. The challenge is to forecast unseen """"future"""" simulated data for three different scenarios at some time points. We estimate current levels of transmissibility, over variable time points under different levels of interventions and use that to forecast near-future incidence.

19744,Estimation of COVID-19 risk-stratified epidemiological parameters and policy implications for Los Angeles County through an integrated risk and stochastic epidemiological model,"SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSHealth disparities have emerged with the COVID-19 epidemic because the risk of exposure to infection and the prevalence of risk factors for severe outcomes given infection vary within and between populations. However, estimated epidemic quantities such as rates of severe illness and death, the case fatality rate (CFR), and infection fatality rate (IFR), are often expressed in terms of aggregated population-level estimates due to the lack of epidemiological data at the refined subpopulation level. For public health policy makers to better address the pandemic, stratified estimates are necessary to investigate the potential outcomes of policy scenarios targeting specific subpopulations.

MethodsWe develop a framework for using available data on the prevalence of COVID-19 risk factors (age, comorbidities, BMI, smoking status) in subpopulations, and epidemic dynamics at the population level and stratified by age, to estimate subpopulation-stratified probabilities of severe illness and the CFR (as deaths over observed infections) and IFR (as deaths over estimated total infections) across risk profiles representing all combinations of risk factors including age, comorbidities, obesity class, and smoking status. A dynamic epidemic model is integrated with a relative risk model to produce time-varying subpopulation-stratified estimates. The integrated model is used to analyze dynamic outcomes and parameters by population and subpopulation, and to simulate alternate policy scenarios that protect specific at-risk subpopulations or modify the population-wide transmission rate. The model is calibrated to data from the Los Angeles County population during the period March 1 - October 15 2020.

FindingsWe estimate a rate of 0.23 (95% CI: 0.13,0.33) of infections observed before April 15, which increased over the epidemic course to 0.41 (0.11,0.69). Overall population-average IFR(t) estimates for LAC peaked at 0.77% (0.38%,1.15%) on May 15 and decreased to 0.55% (0.24%,0.90%) by October 15. The population-average IFR(t) stratified by age group varied extensively across subprofiles representing each combination of the additional risk factors considered (comorbidities, BMI, smoking). We found median IFRs ranging from 0.009%-0.04% in the youngest age group (0-19), from 0.1%-1.8% for those aged 20-44, 0.36%-4.3% for those aged 45-64, and 1.02%-5.42% for those aged 65+. In the group aged 65+ for which the rate of unobserved infections is likely much lower, we find median CFRs in the range 4.4%-23.45%. The initial societal lockdown period avoided overwhelming healthcare capacity and greatly reduced the observed death count. In comparative scenario analysis, alternative policies in which the population-wide transmission rate is reduced to a moderate and sustainable level of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) would not have been sufficient to avoid overwhelming healthcare capacity, and additionally would have exceeded the observed death count. Combining the moderate NPI policy with stringent protection of the at-risk subpopulation of individuals 65+ would have resulted in a death count similar to observed levels, but hospital counts would have approached capacity limits.

InterpretationThe risk of severe illness and death of COVID-19 varies tremendously across subpopulations and over time, suggesting that it is inappropriate to summarize epidemiological parameters for the entire population and epidemic time period. This includes variation not only across age groups, but also within age categories combined with other risk factors analyzed in this study (comorbidities, obesity status, smoking). In the policy analysis accounting for differences in IFR across risk groups in comparing the control of infections and protection of higher risk groups, we find that the strict initial lockdown period in LAC was effective because it both reduced overall transmission and protected individuals at greater risk, resulting in preventing both healthcare overload and deaths. While similar numbers of deaths as observed in LAC could have been achieved with a more moderate NPI policy combined with greater protection of individuals 65+, this would have come at the expense of overwhelming the healthcare system. In anticipation of a continued rise in cases in LAC this winter, policy makers need to consider the trade offs of various policy options on the numbers of the overall population that may become infected, severely ill, and that die when considering policies targeted at subpopulations at greatest risk of transmitting infection and at greatest risk for developing severe outcomes.","Horn, A.

21798,Administration of tocilizumab to patients with high concentrations of IL-6 in the course of COVID-19 is associated with a better prognosis,"BackgroundDespite the direct viral activity, the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) includes an overproduction of cytokines including interleukin 6 (IL-6). Therefore tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptors, became considered as a possible therapeutic option.

MethodsPatients were selected from the SARSTer national database, which included 2332 individuals with COVID-19 and the current study included 825 adult patients with moderate to severe course. The retrospective analysis was performed in 170 patients treated with TCZ and 655 without this medication or any other anti-cytokine therapy. The end-points of treatment effectiveness were a rate of death, need for mechanical ventilation, and clinical improvement.

ResultsPatients treated with TCZ were balanced compared to non-TCZ regarding gender, age, BMI, and prevalence of coexisting conditions. The reduced death rate was demonstrated in patients treated with TCZ and baseline IL-6 >100 pg/ml (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.10-0.78), or those needing oxygen supplementations who worsened within 7 days of hospitalization (HR: 0.38, 95% CI:0.16-0.88).

2360,Role of temperature and humidity in the modulation of the doubling time of COVID-19 cases,"COVID-19 is having a great impact on public health, mortality and economy worldwide, in spite of the efforts to prevent its epidemy. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is different from that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, although also expected to spread differently according to meteorological conditions. Our main goal is to investigate the role of some meteorological variables on the expansion of this outbreak.

In this study, an exponential model relating the number of accumulated confirmed cases and time was considered. The rate of COVID-19 spread, using as criterion the doubling time of the number of confirmed cases, was used as dependent variable in a linear model that took four independent meteorological variables: temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed. Only China cases were considered, to control both cultural aspects and containment policies. Confirmed cases and the 4 meteorological variables were gathered between January 23 and March 1 (39 days) for the 31 provinces of Mainland China. Several periods of time were sampled for each province, obtaining more than one value for the rate of disease progression. Two different periods of time were tested, of 12 and 15 days, along with 3 and 5 different starting points in time, randomly chosen. The median value for each meteorological variable was computed, using the same time period; models with [Formula] were selected. The rate of progression and doubling time were computed and used to fit a linear regression model. Models were evaluated using  = 0.05.

Results indicate that the doubling time correlates positively with temperature and inversely with humidity, suggesting that a decrease in the rate of progression of COVID-19 with the arrival of spring and summer in the north hemisphere. A 20{degrees}C increase is expected to delay the doubling time in 1.8 days. Those variables explain 18% of the variation in disease doubling time; the remaining 82% may be related to containment measures, general health policies, population density, transportation or cultural aspects.","Oliveiros, B.; Caramelo, L.; Ferreira, N.

18621,Viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 can be partially shielded from UV radiation when in particles generated by sneezing or coughing: Numerical simulations,"UV radiation can inactivate viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. However, designing effective UV germicidal irradiation (UVGI) systems can be difficult because the effects of dried respiratory droplets and other fomites on UV light intensities are poorly understood. Numerical modeling of UV intensities inside virus-containing particles on surfaces can increase understanding of these possible reductions in UV intensity. We model UV intensities within spherical approximations of virions randomly positioned within spherical particles. The model virions and dried particles have sizes and optical properties to approximate SARS-CoV-2 and dried particles formed from respiratory droplets, respectively. Wavelengths used are 260 nm (germicidal UVC) and 302 nm (solar UVB). In 5- and 9-m diameter particles on a surface, illuminated by 260-nm UV light from a direction perpendicular to the surface, 10% and 18% (respectively) of simulated virions are exposed to intensities less than 1/100th of intensities in individually exposed virions (i.e., they are partially shielded). Even for 302-nm light, where the absorption is small, 11% of virions in 9-{micro}m particles have exposures 1/100th those of individually exposed virions. Calculated results show that shielding of virions in a particle can be strongly reduced by illuminating a particle either from multiple widely separated incident directions, or by illuminating a particle rotating in air (because of turbulence, Brownian diffusion, etc.) for a time sufficient to rotate through all orientations with respect to the UV illumination. Because highly UV-reflective paints and surfaces can increase the angular ranges of illumination, they appear likely to be useful for reducing shielding of virions.","Doughty, D. C.; Hill, S.

3851,Predict the next moves of COVID-19: reveal the temperate and tropical countries scenario,"The spread of COVID-19 engulfs almost all the countries and territories of the planet, and infections and fatality are increasing rapidly. The first epi-center of its massive spread was in Wuhan, Hubei province, China having a temperate weather, but the spread has got an unprecedented momentum in European temperate countries mainly in Italy and Spain (as of March 30, 2020). However, Malaysia and Singapore and the neighboring tropical countries of China got relatively low spread and fatality that created a research interest on whether there are potential impacts of weather condition on COVID-19 spread. Adopting the SIR (Susceptible Infected Removed) deviated model to predict potential cases and death in the coming days from COVID-19 was done using the secondary and official sources of data. This study shows that COVID-19 spread and fatality tend to be high across the world but compared to tropical countries, it is going to be incredibly high in the temperate countries having lower temperature (7-16{degrees}C) and humidity (80-90%) in last March. However, some literature predicted that this might not to be true, rather irrespective of weather conditions there might be a continuous spread and death. Moreover, a large number of asymptotic COVID-19 carrier in both temperate and tropical countries may re-outbreak in the coming winter. Therefore, a comprehensive global program with the leadership of WHO for testing of entire population of the world is required, which will be very useful for the individual states to take proper political action, social movement and medical services.","Hasan, N.

23972,Knowledge barriers in the symptomatic-COVID-19 testing programme in the UK: an observational study,"BackgroundSymptomatic testing programmes are crucial to the COVID-19 pandemic response. We sought to examine United Kingdom (UK) testing rates amongst individuals with test-qualifying symptoms, and factors associated with not testing.

MethodsWe analysed a cohort of untested symptomatic app users (N=1,237), nested in the Zoe COVID Symptom Study (Zoe, N= 4,394,948); and symptomatic survey respondents who wanted, but did not have a test (N=1,956), drawn from the University of Maryland-Facebook Covid-19 Symptom Survey (UMD-Facebook, N=775,746).

FindingsThe proportion tested among individuals with incident test-qualifying symptoms rose from [~]20% to [~]75% from April to December 2020 in Zoe. Testing was lower with one vs more symptoms (73.0% vs 85.0%), or short vs long symptom duration (72.6% vs 87.8%). 40.4% of survey respondents did not identify all three test-qualifying symptoms. Symptom identification decreased for every decade older (OR=0.908 [95% CI 0.883-0.933]). Amongst symptomatic UMD-Facebook respondents who wanted but did not have a test, not knowing where to go was the most cited factor (32.4%); this increased for each decade older (OR=1.207 [1.129-1.292]) and for every 4-years fewer in education (OR=0.685 [0.599-0.783]).

InterpretationDespite current UK messaging on COVID-19 testing, there is a knowledge gap about when and where to test, and this may be contributing to the [~]25% testing gap. Risk factors, including older age and less education, highlight potential opportunities to tailor public health messages.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSTo assess current evidence on test uptake in symptomatic testing programmes, and the reasons for not testing, we searched PubMed from database inception for research using the keywords (COVID-19) AND (testing) AND ((access) OR (uptake)). We did not find any work reporting on levels of test uptake amongst symptomatic individuals. We found three papers investigating geographic barriers to testing. We found one US based survey reporting on knowledge barriers to testing, and one UK based survey reporting on barriers in the period March - August 2020. Neither of these studies were able to combine testing behaviour with prospectively collected symptom reports from the users surveyed.

Added value of this studyThrough prospective collection of symptom and test reports, we were able to estimate testing uptake amongst individuals with test-qualifying symptoms in the UK. Our results indicate that whilst testing has improved since the start of the pandemic, there remains a considerable testing gap. Investigating this gap we find that individuals with just one test-qualifying symptom or short symptom duration are less likely to get tested. We also find knowledge barriers to testing: a substantial proportion of individuals do not know which symptoms qualify them for a COVID-19 test, and do not know where to seek testing. We find a larger knowledge gap in individuals with older age and fewer years of education.

Implications of all the available evidenceDespite the UK having a simple set of symptom-based testing criteria, with tests made freely available through nationalised healthcare, a quarter of individuals with qualifying symptoms do not get tested. Our findings suggest testing uptake may be limited by individuals not acting on mild or transient symptoms, not recognising the testing criteria, and not knowing where to get tested. Improved messaging may help address this testing gap, with opportunities to target individuals of older age or fewer years of education. Messaging may prove even more valuable in countries with more fragmented testing infrastructure or more nuanced testing criteria, where knowledge barriers are likely to be greater.","Graham, M.

In a cohort of 25 consecutive COVID-19 survivors admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation hospital (76% male), 80% of them had at least one sonographic abnormality of diaphragm muscle structure or function.

Specifically, when compared to established normative data, 76% had reduced diaphragm thickening ratio (impaired contractility), and 20% patients had reduced diaphragm muscle thickness (atrophy). These findings support neuromuscular respiratory dysfunction as a highly prevalent underlying cause for prolonged functional impairments after hospitalization for COVID-19.","Farr, E.; Wolfe, A.

23773,Acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination among health care workers in Ghana,"The acceptance or otherwise of the COVID-19 vaccine by health care workers can influence the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines among the general population as they are a reliable source of health information. In this study, we sought to determine the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines among health care workers in Ghana. Using a cross-sectional design, we collected data from 234 health care workers through a self-administered online survey from 16 January to 15 February 2021. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses using binary logistic regression were performed using STATA version 15. The results showed that 39.3% of health care workers had the intention of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Factors such as sex, category of health care workers, relative being diagnosed with COVID-19, and trust in the accuracy of the measures taken by the government in the fight against COVID-19 proved to be significant predictors of the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine. Concerns about the safety of vaccines and the adverse side effects of the vaccine were identified as the main reasons why health care workers would decline uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in Ghana. The self-reported low intention of health care workers to accept the COVID-19 vaccine in Ghana requires the urgent call of the Government of Ghana and other stakeholders to critically address health care workers concerns about the safety and adverse side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, as this would increase vaccine uptake. Interventions must also take into consideration sex and the category of health care workers to achieve the desired results.","Agyekum, M. W.; Afrifa-Anane, G.

21069,Impact of training modules on physicians perspective of COVID-19: An online survey,"BackgroundThe outbreak of COVID-19 has remained a massive challenge for healthcare workers specially physicians. Effective professional training has a crucial role in preparing doctors for responding to pandemics.

ObjectiveTo assess the effectiveness of existing training modules on enhancing knowledge, ensuring safe practice, and improving behavior on COVID-19 among physicians.

MethodsThis is a descriptive, cross-sectional, online survey; where a virtual questionnaire was used to collect data through online professional platforms. A pre-tested survey tool was employed to assess the impact of professional training on infection prevention and control.

ResultsTotal 161 physicians participated in this survey from 15 different countries. Most of the respondents (72%) received training from various sources like the workplace (60%) and international agencies (21%), through the in-person or online format. Knowledge assessment revealed advanced (43%) and competent (40%) understanding by the participants. Improving knowledge progression was displayed by the cohort who received professional training (p<0.00). Physicians positive behavior and good practices were observed with the training modules.

ConclusionIt became evident from this study, that professional training is effective in enhancing knowledge, improving behavior, and ensuring safe practices. Hence, designing such training modules for the physicians is warranted to tackle ongoing and future pandemics.","Umar, B. U.; Alam, N. N.; Alam, T.; Mannan, M.; Rahman, S. M.

14640,SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a tri-national urban area is dominated by a B.1 lineage variant linked to mass gathering events,"BackgroundThe first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Basel, Switzerland, was detected on February 26th 2020. We present a phylogenetic longitudinal study and explore viral introduction and evolution during the exponential early phase of the local COVID-19 outbreak from February 26th until March 23rd.

MethodsWe sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from naso-oropharyngeal swabs, generated 468 high quality genomes, and called variants with our COVID-19 Pipeline (COVGAP). We analysed viral genetic diversity using PANGOLIN taxonomic lineages. To identify introduction and dissemination events we incorporated global SARS-CoV-2 genomes and inferred a time-calibrated phylogeny.

FindingsThe early outbreak in Basel was dominated by lineage B.1 (83{middle dot}6%), detected from March 2nd, although the first lineage identified was B.1.1. Within B.1, a clade containing 68{middle dot}2% of our samples, defined by the SNP C15324T, suggests local spreading events. We infer the geographic origin of this mutation to our tri-national region. The remaining genomes map broadly over the global phylogenetic tree, evidencing several events of introduction from and/or dissemination to other regions of the world. We also observe family transmission events.

InterpretationA single lineage dominated the outbreak in the City of Basel while other lineages such as the first (B1.1) did not propagate. Thus spreading events seem to have contributed most to viral spread, while travel returners and family transmissions were better controlled by the recommended measures. This phylogenetic analysis enriches epidemiological and contact tracing data, allowing connection of seemingly unconnected events, and can inform public health interventions.

3651,Glucocorticoids inhibit type I IFN beta signaling and the upregulation of CD73 in human lung,"PurposeGlucocorticoids are widely used to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) despite its use is highly controversial based on randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. As type I interferons (IFNs) are our first line of defense against severe viral respiratory infections, we explored whether glucocorticoids interfere with IFN signaling and whether their use associates to outcome of IFN beta treatment of ARDS.

MethodsWe performed a propensity-matched post-hoc-analysis using data from the recent randomized INTEREST-trial comparing IFN beta-1a to placebo in ARDS patients. Based on the results of these analyses we utilized human lung tissue and human pulmonary endothelial cell cultures to investigate the effect of hydrocortisone on IFN nuclear signaling and the protein transcription of CD73, a molecule responsible for vascular integrity.

ResultsWe found that hydrocortisone reduces the production, and prevents the nuclear translocation of IRF9, that is required for IFN beta-dependent signaling of multiple IFN-induced genes. In addition, hydrocortisone inhibits IFN beta-dependent upregulation of CD73 in human lung tissue. Additionally, we found that use of glucocorticoids with IFN beta-1a was independently associated with increased mortality (OR 5.4, 95% CI 2.1-13.9, P< 0.001) in the INTEREST-trial.

ConclusionsGlucocorticoids inhibit type I IFN beta signaling and the upregulation of CD73 in human lung. This provides the mechanistic basis for the harmful association of glucocorticoids in IFN beta treated patients in the INTEREST-trial. Most importantly, it strongly speaks against the use of glucocorticoids in viral-induced ARDS such as in the current corona virus pandemia.

Take home messageGlucocorticoids inhibit type I interferon beta signaling and the upregulation of CD73 that is a key molecule preventing vascular leakage and harmful leukocyte infiltration into the lungs. This work provides the mechanistic basis for the need to avoid glucocorticoids in viral-induced ARDS, in which endogenous interferon is needed to combat the infection and its consequences.","Jalkanen, J.; Pettila, V.; Karvonen, M.; Huttunen, T.; Mandelin, J.; Jalkanen, M.; Malmberg, M.; Elima, K.; Bellingan, G.; Ranieri, V.

10572,Cost effectiveness of interventions for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders following major incidents including terrorism and pandemics,"BackgroundPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is commonly experienced in the aftermath of major incidents such as terrorism and pandemics. Well-established principles of response include effective and scalable treatment for individuals affected by PTSD. In England, such responses have combined proactive outreach, screening, and evidence-based interventions (a """"screen-and-treat"""" approach), but little is known about the cost-effectiveness of this approach.

MethodsA decision modelling analysis was undertaken to estimate the costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained from a screen-and-treat approach compared to treatment-as-usual. Model input variables were drawn from relevant empirical studies in the context of terrorism and the unit costs of health and social care in England. The model was run over a five-year time horizon for a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 exposed adults from the perspective of the National Health Service and Personal Social Services in England.

ResultsThe incremental cost per QALY gained was {pound}8,297. This would be considered cost-effective 95% of the time at a willingness-to-pay threshold of {pound}20,000 per QALY gained, the threshold associated with NICE. Sensitivity analysis confirmed this result was robust.

ConclusionsA screen-and-treat approach for identifying and treating PTSD in adults following major incidents appears cost-effective in England compared to treatment-as-usual through conventional primary care routes. This finding was in the context of terrorism but can be translatable into other major-incident related scenarios including the current COVID-19 pandemic in lieu of data on the impact of this pandemic.

ResultsThe cohort included 290 Arabs and 115 South Asians. South Asians recorded significantly higher COVID-19 death rates compared to Arabs (33% vs. 7.6%, P value<0.001). When compared to Arabs, South Asians also had higher odds of being admitted to the ICU (OR = 6.28, 95% CI: 3.34 - 11.80, p < 0.001).

24920,Impact of COVID-19 on Pediatric Emergency Department Visits: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Background & ObjectiveCOVID-19 has caused significant shifts in healthcare utilization, including pediatric emergency departments (EDs). We describe variations in visits made to two large pediatric EDs during the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to a historical control period.

MethodsWe performed a retrospective cohort study of children presenting to two academic pediatric EDs in Quebec, Canada. We compared the number of ED visits during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic (March-May 2020) to historical controls (March-May 2015-2019), using Poisson regression, adjusting for site and the underlying baseline trend. Secondary analyses examined variations in ED visits by acuity, disposition, and disease categories.

ResultsFrom 2015 to 2019, the two EDs had a median of 1,632 visits per week [interquartile range (IQR) 1,548; 1,703]; in 2020, this number decreased to 536 visits per week [IQR 446; 744]. In multivariable analyses, this represent a 53.3% (95%CI: 52.1, 54.4) reduction in the number of ED visits. The reduction was larger among visits triage categories 4 and 5 (lower acuity) than categories 1, 2 and 3 (higher acuity): -54.2% vs. -42.0% (p<0.001). A greater proportion of children presenting to these sites were hospitalized during the COVID period than in pre-COVID period: 11.8% vs. 5.5% (p<0.001).

8999,"iSCAN: An RT-LAMP-coupled CRISPR-Cas12 module for rapid, sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2","The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 affects all aspects of human life. Detection platforms that are efficient, rapid, accurate, specific, sensitive, and user friendly are urgently needed to manage and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. RT-qPCR based methods are the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, these methods require trained personnel, sophisticated infrastructure, and a long turnaround time, thereby limiting their usefulness. Reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), a one-step nucleic acid amplification method conducted at a single temperature, has been used for colorimetric virus detection. CRISPR-Cas12 and CRISPR-Cas13 systems, which possess collateral activity against ssDNA and RNA, respectively, have also been harnessed for virus detection. Here, we built an efficient, rapid, specific, sensitive, user-friendly SARS-CoV-2 detection module that combines the robust virus amplification of RT-LAMP with the specific detection ability of SARS-CoV-2 by CRISPR-Cas12. Furthermore, we combined the RT-LAMP-CRISPR-Cas12 module with lateral flow cells to enable highly efficient point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 detection. Our iSCAN SARS-CoV-2 detection module, which exhibits the critical features of a robust molecular diagnostic device, should facilitate the effective management and control of COVID-19.","Ali, Z.; Aman, R.; Mahas, A.; Gundra, S.; Tehseen, M.; Marsic, T.; Salunke, R.; Subudhi, A.; Hala, S.; Hamdan, S.; Pain, A.; Hassan, N.; Mahfouz, M.",2020-06-05,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.02.20117739,1,Magdy Mahfouz,KAUST,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.02.20117739v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.02.20117739v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.virusres.2020.198129
17922,SARS-Cov-2 Viral Load as an Indicator for COVID-19 Patients Hospital Stay,"Background/objectiveThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a global threat to the public health. There is a challenge in measuring the patients length of hospital stay and managing the healthcare resources to handle the situation successfully. Our objective is to use the qPCR cycle of threshold (Ct) as a tool in evaluating the severity of the infection and hence the length of hospital stay to better utilize and manage the healthcare resources.

MethodsThis cross sectional study was carried out on 306 patients who admitted to COVID-19 care centers in Kingdom of Bahrain from 20th March 2020 to 5th April 2020. Standard qPCR was used to estimate the viral load and data were analyzed to investigate the relationship between Ct values and various variables.

ResultsOut of 306 patients, 2 deaths, 1 active stable case and 303 recovered cases were reported. Ct value was significantly and negatively associated (P value <0.001) with length of hospital stay. The viral clearance was also inversely associated with the Ct values.

ConclusionCt value was inversely associated with hospital stay duration (and time to viral clearance), higher the Ct value is indicative of faster time to viral clearance. This association could help to better manage the infection and resources allocation.","Alali, S.

26073,System inference via field inversion for the spatio-temporal progression of infectious diseases: Studies of COVID-19 in Michigan and Mexico,"We present an approach to studying and predicting the spatio-temporal progression of infectious diseases. We treat the problem by adopting a partial differential equation (PDE) version of the Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, Deceased (SIRD) compartmental model of epidemiology, which is achieved by replacing compartmental populations by their densities. Building on our recent work (Computational Mechanics, 66, 1177, 2020), we replace our earlier use of global polynomial basis functions with those having local support, as epitomized in the finite element method, for the spatial representation of the SIRD parameters. The time dependence is treated by inferring constant parameters over time intervals that coincide with the time step in semi-discrete numerical implementations. In combination, this amounts to a scheme of field inversion of the SIRD parameters over each time step. Applied to data over ten months of 2020 for the pandemic in the US state of Michigan and to all of Mexico, our system inference via field inversion infers spatio-temporally varying PDE SIRD parameters that replicate the progression of the pandemic with high accuracy. It also produces accurate predictions, when compared against data, for a three week period into 2021. Of note is the insight that is suggested on the spatio-temporal variation of infection, recovery and death rates, as well as patterns of the populations mobility revealed by diffusivities of the compartments.","Wang, Z.; Teja, M.

15249,A SARS-CoV-2 Reference Standard Quantified by Multi-digital PCR Platforms for Quality Assessment of Molecular Tests,"SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans and has caused an emerging and rapidly evolving global pandemic (COVID-19) with significant morbidity and mortality. To meet the urgent and massive demand for the screening and diagnosis of infected individuals, many in vitro diagnostic assays using nucleic acid tests (NATs) have been urgently authorized by regulators worldwide. The limit of detection (LoD) is a crucial feature for a diagnostic assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples, and a reference standard with a well-characterized concentration or titer is of the utmost importance for LoD studies. Although several reference standards of plasmids or synthetic RNA carrying specific genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 have already been announced, a reference standard for inactivated virus particles with accurate concentration is still needed to evaluate the complete procedure including nucleic acid extraction and to accommodate customized primer-probe sets targeting different genome sequences. Here, we performed a collaborative study to estimate the NAT-detectable units as viral genomic equivalent quantity (GEQ) of an inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 reference standard candidate using digital PCR (dPCR) on multiple commercialized platforms. The median of the quantification results (4.6x105 {+/-} 6.5x104 GEQ/mL) was treated as the consensus true value of GEQ of virus particles in the reference standard. This reference standard was then used to challenge the LoDs of six officially approved diagnostic assays. Our study demonstrates that an inactivated whole virus quantified by dPCR can serve as a reference standard and provides a unified solution for assay development, quality control, and regulatory surveillance.","Zhou, H.; Liu, D.; Ma, L.; Ma, T.; Xu, T.; Ren, L.; Li, L.; Xu, S.",2020-09-18,Pathology,10.1101/2020.09.14.20193904,1,Sihong Xu,National Institutes for Food and Drug Control,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.14.20193904v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.14.20193904v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1021/acs.analchem.0c03996
21162,The Socioeconomic Impact of COVID-19 in Urban Informal Settlements,"The COVID-19 pandemic has reached almost every corner of the world. Without a pharmaceutical solution, governments have been forced to implement regulations and public policies to control social behavior and prevent the spread of the virus. There is dramatic evidence of the social and economic effects of these measures and their disparate impact on vulnerable communities. Individuals living in urban informal settlements are in a structurally disadvantaged position to cope with a health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper examines the socioeconomic impact of the crisis brought by the pandemic in informal settlements in Chile. We use a three-wave panel study to compare the situation in informal settlements before and during the health crisis. We show that households living in informal settlements are paying a high toll. Their employment loss is dramatic, substantially larger than the loss reported in the general population, and has particularly affected the inmigrant population. We also find that the pandemic has triggered neighborhood cooperation within the settlements. Targeted government assistance programs have reached these communities; however, this groups coverage is not enough to counteract the magnitude of the crisis. Our results suggest that governments, the non-profit sector, and the community need to urgently provide economic support and protections to individuals living in informal settlements and consider this opportunity for long-term improvements in these marginalized communities.

23290,"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) communities: a qualitative study on the perspectives of BAME community leaders","ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to explore the perspectives of BAME community leaders in relation to - the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their communities; and BAME communitys perception, understanding and adherence to Government guidelines on COVID-19 public health measures.

DesignA phenomenological approach was adopted using qualitative semi-structured interviews.

SettingsCommunity organisations and places of worships in the West Midlands region of England.

ParticipantsCommunity leaders were recruited through organisations representing BAME communities and religious places of worship.

ResultsA total of 19 participants took part. Participants alluded to historical and structural differences for the observed disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Many struggled with lockdown measures which impeded cultural and religious gatherings that were deemed to be integral to the community. Cultural and social practices led to many suffering on their own as discussion of mental health was still deemed a taboo within many communities. Many expressed their communitys reluctance to report symptoms for the fear of financial and physical health implications. They reported increase in hate crime which was deemed to be exacerbated due to perceived insensitive messaging from authority officials and historical structural biases. Access and adherence to government guidelines was an issue for many due to language and digital barriers. Reinforcement from trusted community and religious leaders encouraged adherence. Points of support such as food banks were vital in ensuring essential supplies during the pandemic. Many could not afford masks and sanitisers.

ConclusionThe study highlights the perceived impact of COVID-19 pandemic on BAME communities. Government agencies and public health agencies need to integrate with the community, and community leaders to penetrate the key messages and deliver targeted yet sensitive public health advice which incorporates cultural and religious practices. Addressing route cause of disparities is imperative to mitigate current and future pandemics.

26911,"Modeling third waves of Covid-19 spread with piecewise differential and integral operators: Turkey, Spain and Czechia","Several collected data representing the spread of some infectious disease have demonstrated that the spread does not really exhibit homogeneous spread. Clear examples can include the spread of Spanish flu and Covid-19. Collected data depicting numbers of daily new infections in the case of Covid-19 from countries like Turkey, Spain show three waves with different spread patterns. A clear indication of crossover behaviors. While modelers have suggested many mathematical models to depicting these behaviors, it becomes clear that their mathematical models cannot really capture the crossover behaviors, especially passage from deterministic resetting to stochastics. Very recently Atangana and Seda have suggested a concept of piecewise modeling consisting in defining a differential operator piece-wisely, the idea was first in chaos and outstanding patterns were captured. In this paper, we extend this concept to the field of epidemiology with the aim to depict waves with different patterns. Due to the novelty of this concept, a different approach to insure the existence and uniqueness of system solutions are presented. A piecewise numerical approach is presented to derive numerical solutions of such models. An illustrative example is presented and compared with collected data from 3 different countries including Turkey, Spain and Czechia. The obtained results let no doubt for us to conclude that this concept is a new window that will help mankind to better understand nature.","Atangana, A.; Igret Araz, S.",2021-05-23,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.05.20.21257515,1,Seda Igret Araz,Siirt university,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.20.21257515v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.20.21257515v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
20224,Rapid COVID-19 Diagnosis Using Deep Learning of the Computerized Tomography Scans,"Several studies suggest that COVID-19 may be accompanied by symptoms such as a dry cough, muscle aches, sore throat, and mild to moderate respiratory illness. The symptoms of this disease indicate the fact that COVID-19 causes noticeable negative effects on the lungs. Therefore, considering the health status of the lungs using X-rays and CT scans of the chest can significantly help diagnose COVID-19 infection. Due to the fact that most of the methods that have been proposed to COVID-19 diagnose deal with the lengthy testing time and also might give more false positive and false negative results, this paper aims to review and implement artificial intelligence (AI) image-based diagnosis methods in order to detect coronavirus infection with zero or near to zero false positives and false negatives rates. Besides the already existing AI image-based medical diagnosis method for the other well-known disease, this study aims on finding the most accurate COVID-19 detection method among AI methods such as machine learning (ML) and artificial neural network (ANN), ensemble learning (EL) methods.","Tabrizchi, H.; Mosavi, A.; Szabo-Gali, A.; Nadai, L.",2020-12-23,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.12.20.20248582,1,Amir Mosavi,Obuda University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.20.20248582v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.20.20248582v1.full.pdf,cc_by,"NA"
15687,Comparative Effectiveness of Famotidine in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients,"BackgroundFamotidine has been posited as a potential treatment for COVID-19. We compared the incidence of COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., death; and death or intensive services use) among hospitalized famotidine users vs. proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) users, hydroxychloroquine users or famotidine non-users separately.

MethodsWe constructed a retrospective cohort study using data from COVID-19 Premier Hospital electronic health records. Study population were COVID-19 hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older. Famotidine, PPI and hydroxychloroquine exposure groups were defined as patients dispensed any medication containing one of the three drugs on the day of admission. The famotidine non-user group was derived from the same source population with no history of exposure to any drug with famotidine as an active ingredient prior to or on the day of admission. Time-at-risk was defined based on the intention-to-treat principle starting 1 day after admission to 30 days after admission. For each study comparison group, we fit a propensity score (PS) model through large-scale regularized B logistic regression. The outcome was modeled using a survival model.

ResultsWe identified 2193 users of PPI, 5950 users of the hydroxychloroquine, 1816 users of famotidine and 26,820 non-famotidine users. After PS stratification, the hazard ratios for death were as follows: famotidine vs no famotidine HR 1.03 (0.89-1.18); vs PPIs: HR 1.14 (0.94-1.39); vs hydroxychloroquine:1.03 (0.85-1.24). Similar results were observed for the risk of death or intensive services use.

ConclusionWe found no evidence of a reduced risk of COVID-19 outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients who used famotidine compared to those who did not or compared to PPI or hydroxychloroquine users.","Shoaibi, A.; Fortin, S.; Weinstein, R.; Berlin, J.; Ryan, P.",2020-09-24,Gastroenterology,10.1101/2020.09.23.20199463,1,Azza Shoaibi,"Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Titusville, NJ, USA",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.23.20199463v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.23.20199463v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.14309/ajg.0000000000001153
17766,"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Saint Petersburg, Russia: a population-based study","BackgroundEstimates from initial SARS-CoV-2 serological surveys were likely to be biased due to convenience sampling whereas large-scale population-based serosurveys could be biased due to non-response. This study aims to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Saint Petersburg, Russia accounting for non-response bias.

MethodsWe recruited a random sample of adults residing in St. Petersburg with random digit dialling. Computer-assisted telephone interview was followed by an invitation for an antibody test with randomized rewards for participation. Blood samples collected between May 27, 2020 and June 26, 2020 were assessed for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two tests -- CMIA and ELISA. The seroprevalence estimates were corrected for non-response bias, test sensitivity, and specificity. Individual characteristics associated with seropositivity were assessed.

Findings66,250 individuals were contacted, 6,440 adults agreed to be interviewed and were invited to participate in the serosurvey. Blood samples were obtained from 1038 participants. Naive seroprevalence corrected for test characteristics was 9.0% [95% CI 7.2-10.8] by CMIA and 10.8% [8.8-12.7] by ELISA. Correction for non-response bias decreased seroprevalence estimates to 7.4% [5.7-9.2] for CMIA and to 9.3% [7.4-11.2] for ELISA. The most pronounced decrease in non-response bias-corrected seroprevalence was attributed to the history of any illnesses in the past 3 months and COVID-19 testing. Besides that seroconversion was negatively associated with smoking status, self-reported history of allergies and changes in hand-washing habits.

InterpretationThese results suggest that even low estimates of seroprevalence in Europes fourth-largest city can be an overestimation in the presence of non-response bias. Serosurvey design should attempt to identify characteristics that are associated both with participation and seropositivity. Further population-based studies are required to explain the lower seroprevalence in smokers and participant reporting allergies.

26258,Precision Health Diagnostic and Surveillance Network uses S Gene Target Failure (SGTF) combined with sequencing technologies to identify emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.,"Several genomic epidemiology tools have been developed to track the public and population health impact of SARS-CoV-2 community spread worldwide. A SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VOC) B.1.1.7, known as 501Y.V1, which shows increased transmissibility, has rapidly become the dominant VOC in the United States (US). Our objective was to develop an evidenced-based genomic surveillance algorithm that combines RT-PCR and sequencing technologies to identify VOCs. Deidentified data were obtained from 508,969 patients tested for COVID-19 with the TaqPath COVID-19 RT-PCR Combo Kit (ThermoFisher) in four CLIA certified clinical laboratories in Puerto Rico (n=86,639) and in three CLIA certified clinical laboratories in the US (n=422,330). TaqPath data revealed a frequency of S Gene Target Failure (SGTF) >47% for the last week of March 2021, in both Puerto Rico and US laboratories. The monthly frequency of SGTF in Puerto Rico steadily increased exponentially from 4% in November 2020 to 47% in March 2021.The weekly SGTF rate in US samples was high (>8%) from late December to early January, and then also increased exponentially through April (48%). The exponential increase in SGFT prevalence in Puerto Rico is concurrent with a sharp increase in VOCs among all SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Puerto Rico uploaded to GISAID (n=461). B.1.1.7 frequency increased from <1% in the last week of January 2021 to 51.5% of viral sequences from Puerto Rico collected in the last week of March 2021. The exponential increase in SGTF and B.1.1.7 prevalence in Puerto Rico and US requires an urgent response. According to the proposed evidence-based algorithm, approximately 50% of all positive samples should be managed as potential B.1.1.7 carriers with VOC quarantine and contact tracing protocols while their lineage is confirmed by WGS in surveillance laboratories. Patients infected with VOCs should be effectively triaged for isolation, contact tracing and follow-up treatment purposes.","Guerrero-Preston, R.; Rivera Amill, V.; Caraballo, K.; Arias Garcia, A.; Sanchez Torres, R.; Tadeu Zamuner, F.; Zanettini, C.; Mackay, M.

7906,Effects of Government Mandated Social Distancing Measures on Cumulative Incidence of COVID-19 in the United States and its Most Populated Cities,"COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has quickly spread throughout the world, necessitating assessment of the most effective containment methods. Very little research exists on the effects of social distancing measures on this pandemic. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of government implemented social distancing measures on the cumulative incidence rates of COVID-19 in the United States on a state level, and in the 25 most populated cities, while adjusting for socio-demographic risk factors. The social distancing variables assessed in this study were: days to closing of non-essential business; days to stay home orders; days to restrictions on gathering, days to restaurant closings and days to school closing. Using negative binomial regression, adjusted rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated comparing two levels of a binary variable: """"above median value,"""" and """"median value and below"""" for days to implementing a social distancing measure. For city level data, the effects of these social distancing variables were also assessed in high (above median value) vs low (median value and below) population density cities. For the state level analysis, days to school closing was associated with cumulative incidence, with an adjusted rate ratio of 1.59 (95% CI:1.03,2.44), p=0.04 at 35 days. Some results were counterintuitive, including inverse associations between cumulative incidence and days to closure of non-essential business and restrictions on gatherings. This finding is likely due to reverse causality, where locations with slower growth rates initially chose not to implement measures, and later implemented measures when they absolutely needed to respond to increasing rates of infection. Effects of social distancing measures seemed to vary by population density in cities. Our results suggest that the effect of social distancing measures may differ between states and cities and between locations with different population densities. States and cities need individual approaches to containment of an epidemic, with an awareness of their own structure in terms of crowding and socio-economic variables. In an effort to reduce infection rates, cities may want to implement social distancing in advance of state mandates.","Krishnamachari, B.; Dsida, A.; Zastrow, D.; Harper, B.; Morris, A.; Santella, A.",2020-05-24,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.22.20110460,1,Bhuma Krishnamachari,New York Institute of Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.20110460v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.20110460v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
10391,Knowledge about COVID-19 and patients beliefs about and use of herbal products during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study in Saudi Arabia,"The lack of treatment options for COVID-19 has raised many concerns among populations worldwide, which has led to many attempts to find alternative options to prevent the transmission of the disease or to alleviate the progression of the infection, including focusing more on preventive measures (to prevent transmission to other individuals) and the use of natural products and herbal extracts to increase immunity and decrease the probability of getting infected. This study explored the knowledge of the population of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) about COVID-19 preventive measures and their belief about the consumption of herbal products for the prevention of COVID-19 infection. A total of 5,258 individuals participated in this study. Participants knowledge about the appropriate COVID-19 preventive measures in terms of handwashing procedures, self-quarantine and social distancing was moderate, with a mean score of 5.5 (SD: 1.7) out of 10 (representing around 55.0% of the total score). About 22.1% (n= 1,161) of the participants reported that they have used herbal products or nutritional supplements during the pandemic period, to protect themselves from the disease. Social media and the Internet (39.4%, n= 372) were the main motivators for the participants to try herbal products. Vitamin C was the most commonly used food supplement to increase immunity and reduces the chance of contracting COVID-19. Our study demonstrated that the general population in Saudi Arabia has a moderate level of knowledge about COVID-19 transmission and preventive measures. A considerable proportion of the population reported the use of herbal products or food supplements in order to protect themselves from the disease.

14676,Immunological characteristics govern the changing severity of COVID-19 during the transition to endemicity,"1As prospects for eradicating CoV-2 dwindle, we are faced with the question of how the severity of CoV-2 disease may change in the years ahead. Will CoV-2 continue to be a pathogenic scourge that, like smallpox or measles, can be tamed only by ongoing vaccination, or will it join the ranks of mild endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs)? Our analysis of immunological and epidemiological data on HCoVs shows that infection-blocking immunity wanes rapidly, but disease-reducing immunity is long-lived. We estimate the relevant parameters and incorporate them into a new epidemiological model framework which separates these different components of immunity. Our model recapitulates both the current severity of CoV-2 and the relatively benign nature of HCoVs; suggesting that once the endemic phase is reached, CoV-2 may be no more virulent than the common cold. The benign outcome at the endemic phase is contingent on the virus causing primary infections in children. We predict a very different outcome were a CoV like MERS (that causes severe disease in children) to become endemic. These results force us to re-evaluate control measures that rely on identifying and isolating symptomatic infections, and reconsider ideas regarding herd immunity and the use of immune individuals as shields to protect vulnerable groups.","Lavine, J.

6560,ProgNet: Covid-19 prognosis using recurrent andconvolutional neural networks,"--Humanity is facing nowadays a dramatic pandemic episode with the Coronavirus propagation over all continents. The Covid-19 disease is still not well characterized, and many research teams all over the world are working on either therapeutic or vaccination issues. Massive testing is one of the main recommendations. In addition to laboratory tests, imagery-based tools are being widely investigated. Artificial intelligence is therefore contributing to the efforts made to face this pandemic phase.

Regarding patients in hospitals, it is important to monitor the evolution of lung pathologies due to the virus. A prognosis is therefore of great interest for doctors to adapt their care strategy. In this paper, we propose a method for Covid-19 prognosis based on deep learning architectures. The proposed method is based on the combination of a convolutional and recurrent neural networks to classify multi-temporal chest X-ray images and predict the evolution of the observed lung pathology. When applied to radiological time-series, promising results are obtained with an accuracy rates higher than 92%.","Fakhfakh, M.; Bouaziz, B.; Gargouri, F.; Chaari, L.",2020-05-08,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.05.06.20092874,1,Lotfi Chaari,Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.20092874v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.20092874v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.2174/1874347102012010011
12818,"Delayed Interventions, Low Compliance, and Health Disparities Amplified the Early Spread of COVID-19","The United States (US) public health interventions were rigorous and rapid, yet failed to arrest the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as infections spread throughout the US. Many factors have contributed to the spread of COVID-19, and the success of public health interventions depends on the level of community adherence to preventative measures. Public health professionals must also understand regional demographic variation in health disparities and determinants to target interventions more effectively. In this study, a systematic evaluation of three significant interventions employed in the US, and their effectiveness in slowing the early spread of COVID-19 was conducted. Next, community-level compliance with a state-level stay at home orders was assessed to determine COVID-19 spread behavior. Finally, health disparities that may have contributed to the disproportionate acceleration of early COVID-19 spread between certain counties were characterized. The contribution of these factors for the disproportionate spread of the disease was analyzed using both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. Results of this investigation show that delayed implementation of public health interventions, a low level of compliance with the stay at home orders, in conjunction with health disparities, significantly contributed to the early spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jalali, A.

17927,Severity of Respiratory Infections due to SARS-CoV-2 in Working Population: Age and Body Mass Index Outweigh ABO Blood Group,"BackgroundWith increasing rates of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the intention to avoid a lock-down, the risks for the working population are of great interest. No large studies have been conducted which allow risk assessment for this population.

MethodsDKMS is a non-profit donor center for stem cell donation and reaches out to registered volunteers between 18 and 61 years of age. To identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 courses in this population we performed a cross-sectional study. Self-reported data on oro- or nasopharyngeal swabs, risk factors, symptoms and treatment were collected with a health questionnaire and linked to existing genetic data. We fitted multivariable logistic regression models for the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, risk of severe respiratory infection and risk of hospitalization.

FindingsOf 4,440,895 contacted volunteers 924,660 (20.8%) participated in the study. Among 157,544 participants tested, 7,948 reported SARS-CoV-2 detection. Of those, 947 participants (11.9%) reported an asymptomatic course, 5,014 (63.1%) mild/moderate respiratory infections, and 1,987 (25%) severe respiratory tract infections. In total, 286 participants (3.6%) were hospitalized for respiratory tract infections. The risk of hospitalization in comparison to a 20-year old person of normal weight was 2.1-fold higher (95%-CI, 1.2-3.69, p=0.01) for a person of same age with a BMI between 35-40 kg/m2, it was 5.33-fold higher (95%-CI, 2.92-9.70, p<0.001) for a 55-year old person with normal weight and 11.2-fold higher (95%-CI, 10.1-14.6, p<0.001) for a 55-year old person with a BMI between 35-40 kg/m2. Blood group A was associated with a 1.15-fold higher risk for contracting SARS-CoV-2 (95%-CI 1.08-1.22, p<0.001) than blood group O but did not impact COVID-19 severity.

InterpretationIn this relatively healthy population, the risk for hospitalizations due to SARS-CoV-2 infections was moderate. Age and BMI were major risk factors. These data may help to tailor risk-stratified preventive measures.

22051,HEALTHCARE WORKERS PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS At EARLY PHASE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN MOROCCO,"IntroductionThe mental being of healthcare workers with the COVID 19 pandemic is a determinant of their resilience. We investigated the psychological impact of health workers during early phase of Covid 19 pandemic in Morocco.

MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study based on a survey of health workers of the Rabat University Hospital Ibn-Sina in Morocco. Data were collected during the first week of health emergency state -between 23 and 30 march-related to the covid-19 pandemic declaration in Morocco. Sociodemographic, health characteristics and professional characteristics of each health worker were collected. We also evaluated the knowledge of health workers concerning the protective measures against COVID 19. The mental health status of the health workers was investigated using the Arabic validated version of HADS 14 items, evaluating hospital anxiety and depression

ResultsTwo hundred eighty-seven health workers were included.The mean age was 34.4{+/-}12.18 year; and 64.5% were female, 54% have been trained regarding protection procedures, and 94.8% declared that they are aware of individual protection measures. The incidence of anxiety and depression was respectively 77.4% and 73.9%. High degree of anxiety and depression was associated with female gender. However, Higher degree of anxiety was also related to function, specialty of practice, and knowledge of the protective measures against COVID-19.

ConclusionWe reported the result of the first evaluation of psychological burden of health worker during early period of COVID-19 pandemic in a developing country. The study showed high frequency of anxiety and depression among Moroccan health worker in a hospital faced to COVID-19 patient management.","Belayachi, J.; Benammi, S.; Chippo, H.; Bennis, R.

3018,"COVID-19 clinical characteristics, and sex-specific risk of mortality: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","ObjectivesThe rapidly evolving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. It was first detected in the city of Wuhan in China and has spread globally resulting in substantial health and economic crisis in many countries. Observational studies have partially identified the different aspects of this disease. Up to this date, no comprehensive systematic review for the clinical, laboratory, epidemiologic and mortality findings has been published. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis for a better understanding of COVID-19.

MethodsWe reviewed the scientific literature published from January 1, 2019 to March 3, 2020. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA (version 14, IC; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). The pooled frequency with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was assessed using random effect model. Publication bias was assessed and p <0.05 was considered a statistically significant publication bias.

ResultsOut of 1102 studies, 32 satisfied the inclusion criteria. A total of 4789 patients with a mean age of 49 years were evaluated. Fever (83.0%, CI 77.5 to 87.6), cough (65.2%, CI 58.6 to 71.2) and myalgia/fatigue (34.7, CI 26.0 to 44.4) were the most common symptoms. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (18.5 %, CI 12.7 to 24.4) and Cardiovascular disease (14.9 %, CI 6.0 to 23.8). Among the laboratory abnormalities, elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (72.0% (CI 54.3 to 84.6) and lymphopenia (50.1%, CI 38.0 to 62.4) were the most common findings. Bilateral ground-glass opacities (66.0%, CI 51.1 to 78.0) was the most common CT-Scan presentation. Pooled mortality rate was 6.6%, with males having significantly higher mortality compared to females (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 9.1, P = 0.01).

ConclusionCOVID-19 commonly presented with a progressive course of cough and fever with more than half of hospitalized patients showing leukopenia or a high CRP on their laboratory findings. Mortality associated with COVID19 was higher than that reported in studies in China with Males having a 3-fold higher risk of mortality in COVID19 compared to females.

7935,A pattern categorization of CT findings to predict outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia,"AbstractsO_ST_ABSPurposeC_ST_ABSAs global healthcare system is overwhelmed by novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), early identification of risks of adverse outcomes becomes the key to optimize management and improve survival. This study aimed to provide a CT-based pattern categorization to predict outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia.

Methods165 patients with COVID-19 (91 men, 4-89 years) underwent chest CT were retrospectively enrolled. CT findings were categorized as Pattern0 (negative), Pattern1 (bronchopneumonia), Pattern2 (organizing pneumonia), Pattern3 (progressive organizing pneumonia) and Pattern4 (diffuse alveolar damage). Clinical findings were compared across different categories. Time-dependent progression of CT patterns and correlations with clinical outcomes, i.e. discharge or adverse outcome (admission to ICU, requiring mechanical ventilation, or death), with pulmonary sequelae (complete absorption or residuals) on CT after discharge were analyzed.

ResultsOf 94 patients with outcome, 81(86.2%) were discharged, 3(3.2%) were admitted to ICU, 4(4.3%) required mechanical ventilation, 6(6.4%) died. 31(38.3%) had complete absorption at median day 37 after symptom-onset. Significant differences between pattern-categories were found in age, disease-severity, comorbidity and laboratory results (all P<0.05). Remarkable evolution was observed in Pattern0-2 and Pattern3-4 within 3 and 2 weeks after symptom-onset, respectively; most of patterns remained thereafter. After controlling for age, CT pattern significantly correlated with adverse outcomes (Pattern4 vs. Pattern0-3 [reference]; hazard-ratio[95%CI], 18.90[1.91-186.60], P=0.012). CT pattern (Pattern3-4 vs. Pattern0-2 [reference]; 0.26[0.08-0.88], P=0.030) and C-reactive protein (>10 vs. [&le;]10mg/L [reference]; 0.31[0.13-0.72], P=0.006) were risk-factors associated with pulmonary residuals.

Little is known about the frequency of specific symptoms in the general population, and how symptoms predict the magnitude of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsWe quantified IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) in home-collected dried blood spot samples from 3,365 adults participating in a community-based seroprevalence study in the city of Chicago, USA, collected between June 24 and November 11, 2020.

Results17.8% of the sample was seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. A cluster of symptoms (loss of sense of smell or taste, fever, shortness of breath, muscle or body aches, cough, fatigue, diarrhea, headache) was associated with stronger anti-RBD IgG responses among the seropositives. 39.2% of infections were asymptomatic, and 2 or fewer symptoms were reported for 66.7% of infections. Total number of symptoms was positively but weakly associated with IgG response: Median anti-RBD IgG was 0.95 ug/mL for individuals with 3 or more symptoms, in comparison with 0.61 ug/mL for asymptomatic infections.

ConclusionWe document high rates of asymptomatic and mild infection in a large community-based cohort, and relatively low levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in the general population of previously exposed individuals.","Mcdade, T.

A nationwide case-control study,"ObjectiveTo determine the risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 among teachers and their household members, overall and compared to healthcare workers and the general working-age population.

DesignPopulation-based nested case-control study.

SettingsScotland, March 2020 to January 2021. Before and after schools re-opened in early August 2020.

ParticipantsAll cases of COVID-19 in Scotland in adults ages 21 to 65 (n = 83,817) and a random sample of controls matched on age, sex and general practice (n = 841,708).

ExposureIndividuals identified as actively teaching in a Scottish school by the General Teaching Council for Scotland, and household members of such individuals identified via the Unique Property Reference Number.

ComparatorIndividuals identified as healthcare workers in Scotland, their household members, and the remaining """"general population"""" of working-age adults.

Main outcomesThe primary outcome was hospitalisation with COVID-19 defined in anyone testing positive with COVID-19 in hospital, admitted to hospital within 28 days of a positive test, and/or diagnosed with COVID-19 on discharge from hospital. Severe COVID-19 was defined as individuals admitted to intensive care or dying within 28 days of a positive test or assigned COVID-19 as a cause of death.

ResultsMost teachers were young (mean age 42), female (80%) and had no underlying conditions (84%). The cumulative incidence (risk) of hospitalisation with COVID-19 was below 1% for all of the working age adults. In the period after school re-opening, compared to the general population, in conditional logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, general practice, deprivation, underlying conditions and number of adults in the household, the relative risk in teachers (among 18,479 cases and controls) for hospitalisation was rate ratio (RR) 0.97 (95%CI 0.72-1.29) and for severe COVID-19 was RR 0.27 (95%CI 0.09-0.77). Equivalent rate ratios for household members of teachers were 0.97 (95%CI 0.74-1.27) and 0.67 (95%CI 0.36-1.24), and for healthcare workers were 1.82 (95%CI 1.55-2.14) and 1.76 (95%CI 1.22-2.56), respectively.

ConclusionCompared to working-age adults who are otherwise similar, teachers and their household members are not at increased risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 and are at lower risk of severe COVID-19.

By investigating 47 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 16 uninfected controls, we found an immunometabolic dysregulation specific for patients with progressed disease that was reversible in the recovery phase. Specifically, T cells and monocytes exhibited increased mitochondrial mass, accumulated intracellular ROS and these changes were accompanied by disrupted mitochondrial architecture. Basigin (CD147), but not established markers of T cell activation, was up-regulated on T cells from progressed COVID-19 patients and correlated with ROS accumulation, reflected in the transcriptome. During recovery, basigin and ROS decreased to match the uninfected controls. In vitro analyses confirmed the correlation and showed a down-regulation of ROS by dexamethasone treatment. Our findings provide evidence of a basigin-related and reversible immunometabolic dysregulation in COVID-19.","Siska, P.

9218,A COVID-19 outbreak in a rheumatology department upon the early days of the pandemic,"ObjectivesTo describe our experience with a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak within a large rheumatology department, early in the pandemic.

MethodsSymptomatic and asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) had a naso-oropharyngeal swab for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and were followed clinically. Reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was repeated to document cure, and serological response was assessed. Patients with risk contacts within the department in the 14 days preceding the outbreak were screened for COVID-19 symptoms.

Results14/34 HCWs (41%; 40{+/-}14 years, 71% female) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 11/34 (32%) developed symptoms but were RT-PCR-negative. Half of RT-PCR-positive HCWs did not report fever, cough, or dyspnoea before testing, which were absent in 3/14 cases (21%). Mild disease prevailed (79%), but 3 HCWs had moderate disease requiring further assessment, which excluded severe complications. Nevertheless, symptom duration (28{+/-}18 days), viral shedding (31{+/-}10 days post-symptom onset, range 15-51) and work absence (29{+/-}28 days) were prolonged. 13/14 (93%) of RT-PCR-positive and none of the RT-PCR-negative HCWs had a positive humoral response, with higher IgG-index in individuals over 50 years (14.5{+/-}7.7 vs 5.0{+/-}4.4, p=0.012). Of 617 rheumatic patients, 8 (1.3%) developed COVID-19 symptoms (1/8 hospitalisation, 8/8 complete recovery), following a consultation/procedure with an asymptomatic (7/8) or mildly-symptomatic (1/8) HCW.

ConclusionsA COVID-19 outbreak can occur among HCWs and rheumatic patients, swiftly spreading over the presymptomatic stage. Mild disease without typical symptoms should be recognised, and may evolve with delayed viral shedding, prolonged recovery, and adequate immune response in most individuals.

O_LSTKey messagesC_LSTO_LIHigh infection rates have been reported in healthcare workers (HCWs) dealing with COVID-19 patients. Less is known about potential transmission by pre/asymptomatic carriers, which may be important in the context of rheumatology practice, among both HCWs and patients.

18766,Assessment of effectiveness of a COVID-adapted diagnostic pathway for colorectal cancer to mitigate the adverse impact on investigation and referrals,"ObjectivesThe Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to impose formidable challenges on healthcare services. The dramatic curtailment of endoscopy and CT colonography capacity has adversely impacted on timely diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). We describe a COVID-adapted pathway rapidly implemented to mitigate risk and maximise cancer diagnosis in patients referred with symptoms of suspected CRC during the pandemic.

DesignThe """"COVID-adapted pathway"""" integrated multiple quantitative faecal immunochemical tests (qFIT), to enrich for significant colorectal disease. CT with oral contrast was used to detect gross pathology. Patients reporting  high-risk symptoms were triaged to qFIT+CT and the remainder underwent initial qFIT. Prospective data collection comprised referral category, symptoms, blood results, medical history, time to first test, qFIT and CT results.

SettingTertiary colorectal unit which manages over 500 cancer patients annually.

ParticipantsAll patients referred as  urgent suspicious of cancer (USOC) were included. Overall 422 patients (median age 64 years, 220 females) were triaged using this pathway.

Main outcome measuresOutcomes comprised cancer detection frequency.

ResultsCompared to the same time period (1st April - 31st May) in 2017-2019, we observed a 43% reduction in primary care referrals with suspected CRC (1071 referrals expected reducing to 609). Overall 422 patients (median age 64 years, 220 females) were triaged using this pathway. Most (84{middle dot}6%) were referred as USOC. Of the 422 patients, 202 (47{middle dot}9%) were triaged to CT and qFIT, 211 (50{middle dot}0%) to qFIT only, eight (1{middle dot}9%) to outpatient clinic, and one to colonoscopy. Fifteen (3{middle dot}6%) declined investigation and seven (1{middle dot}7%) were deemed unfit. We detected 13 cancers (3{middle dot}1%); similar to the mean cancer detection rate from all referrals in 2017-2019 (3{middle dot}3%).

ConclusionsThe response to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a marked reduction in referrals and cessation of key diagnostic services. Although this COVID-adapted pathway mitigated the adverse effects on diagnostic capacity, the overall reduction in expected diagnoses is very substantial. It is clear that the adverse impact of measures taken to constrain the pandemic will lead to many undetected cancers due to the decrease in referrals.

21943,"ABC2-SPH risk score for in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients: development, external validation and comparison with other available scores","ObjectiveTo develop and validate a rapid scoring system at hospital admission for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), and to compare this score with other existing ones.

DesignCohort study

SettingThe Brazilian COVID-19 Registry has been conducted in 36 Brazilian hospitals in 17 cities. Logistic regression analysis was performed to develop a prediction model for in-hospital mortality, based on the 3978 patients that were admitted between March-July, 2020. The model was then validated in the 1054 patients admitted during August-September, as well as in an external cohort of 474 Spanish patients.

ParticipantsConsecutive symptomatic patients ([&ge;]18 years old) with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 admitted to participating hospitals. Patients who were transferred between hospitals and in whom admission data from the first hospital or the last hospital were not available were excluded, as well those who were admitted for other reasons and developed COVID-19 symptoms during their stay.

Main outcome measuresIn-hospital mortality

ResultsMedian (25th-75th percentile) age of the model-derivation cohort was 60 (48-72) years, 53.8% were men, in-hospital mortality was 20.3%. The validation cohorts had similar age distribution and in-hospital mortality. From 20 potential predictors, seven significant variables were included in the in-hospital mortality risk score: age, blood urea nitrogen, number of comorbidities, C-reactive protein, SpO2/FiO2 ratio, platelet count and heart rate. The model had high discriminatory value (AUROC 0.844, 95% CI 0.829 to 0.859), which was confirmed in the Brazilian (0.859) and Spanish (0.899) validation cohorts. Our ABC2-SPH score showed good calibration in both Brazilian cohorts, but, in the Spanish cohort, mortality was somewhat underestimated in patients with very high (>25%) risk. The ABC2-SPH score is implemented in a freely available online risk calculator (https://abc2sph.com/).

ConclusionsWe designed and validated an easy-to-use rapid scoring system based on characteristics of COVID-19 patients commonly available at hospital presentation, for early stratification for in-hospital mortality risk of patients with COVID-19.

6236,Evaluating growth pattern and assessing future scenario of COVID-19 epidemic of India,"COVID-19 the modern pandemic has spread across the world at a rapid pace. SARS-CoV 2 is highly transmissible and the rate of infection is exponential for heavily infected countries. Asymptotic carriers and longer incubation period have been key towards such a large-scale distribution of disease. Data released by official authorities on COVID-19 cases is significantly affected by various factors such as size of sample, incubation period of disease and time taken to test the sample. These factors mask the useful pattern (signal) of disease spread. Thus, an ingenious method to group data into cycles of five and seven days, for studying pattern of disease spread is undertaken. Occurrence of recurrent peaks as indicated by Adjusted Rate of infection per day indicated the spread of disease has been non-uniform. Currently, India is yet to reach the critical point (peak of epidemic) with adjusted daily cases more than 1000. Increasing testing capacity along with random sampling and sample pooling can help in preventing formation of these peaks in future. The proposed method helps in assessing the current state and for predicting future scenarios epidemics.","Patil, N. L.; Gangavati, L.

16609,The Characteristics of Health Care Workers with COVID-19 and Relationship Between COVID-19 Mortality and BCG/Tuberculosis History: a multi-center study,"BackgroundToday, COVID-19 pandemic has brought countries health services into sharp focus. Despite the low incidence of cases(1.2%) and high mortality rate(2.4%) among Turkish population, the low mortality rate(0.3%) despite the high incidence(11.5%) declared in healthcare workers drew our groups attention. Therefore, we aimed to report the characteristics of infected health-care workers and investigate the relationship between BCG vaccine and tuberculosis history with COVID-19 mortality in infected health-care worker population.

MethodThis study was conducted in three hospitals to assess the clinical presentations, disease severity and correlation with BCG vaccine and tuberculous history in COVID-19 positive health-care workers by an online questionnaire platform. The relationship between characteristics and tuberculosis history were investigated according to hospitalization status of the patients.

ResultTotal of 465 infected healthcare workers included in the study. The rate of history of direct care and contact to tuberculosis patient, presence of previous tuberculosis treatment and BCG scar, presence of radiological infiltrations was significantly higher in hospitalized healthcare workers. The ratio of direct care and direct contact to the patient with tuberculosis, and presence of family history of tuberculosis were statistically significantly higher in patients with radiological infiltrations.

ConclusionAlthough COVID-19 risk and incidence are higher among healthcare workers compared to the normal population due to higher virus load, this study brings evidence for the fact that the lower mortality rate seen in infected healthcare workers might be due to healthcare workers frequent exposure to tuberculosis bacillus and the mortality-reducing effects of BCG vaccine, despite the higher hospitalization rate and radiological infiltrations due to over-triggered immune system.","Torun, S.; Ozkaya, S.; Sen, N.; Kanat, F.; Karaman, I.; Yosunkaya, S.; Sengoren Dikis, O.; Asan, A.; Aydogan Eroglu, S.; Atal, S.

8866,Therapeutic Anticoagulation Is Associated with Decreased Mortality in Mechanically Ventilated COVID-19 Patients,"ObjectiveTo evaluate differences in morbidity and mortality among mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 treated with therapeutic versus prophylactic anticoagulation.

MethodsWe performed a retrospective review of 245 COVID-19 positive patients admitted to the ICU requiring mechanical ventilation from March 1, 2020 through April 11, 2020 at Mount Sinai Hospital. Patients either received therapeutic anticoagulation for a minimum of 5 days or prophylactic dose anticoagulation. Morbidity and mortality data were analyzed.

ResultsPropensity score (PS) weighted Kaplan-Meier plot demonstrated a survival advantage (57% vs. 25%) at 35 days from admission to the ICU in patients who received therapeutic anticoagulation for a minimum of 5 days compared to those who received prophylactic anticoagulation during their hospital course. A multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model with PS weights to adjust for baseline differences found a 79% reduction in death in patients who were therapeutically anticoagulated HR 0.209, [95% Cl (0.10, 0.46), p < 0.001]. Bleeding complications were similar between both groups. A 26.7% [95% Cl (1.16, 1.39), p< 0.001] excess mortality was found for each 1 mg/dL rise in serum creatinine over a 21-day period.

19304,Screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic individuals using the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test (Abbott) compared to RT-qPCR,"BackgroundAntigen-based point of care tests for identification of SARS-CoV-2 may markedly enhance effectiveness of population-based controlling strategies. Previous studies have demonstrated acceptable sensitivity and high specificity compared to RT-qPCR in symptomatic individuals, but test performance for asymptomatic individuals is unknown.

MethodsTest performance of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott) was compared to RT-qPCR in a longitudinal cohort study of asymptomatic football players and staff members of professional football clubs. Based on timing of symptoms and prior and subsequent test results, positive RT-qPCR tests were categorized as pre-symptomatic, early or late infection or persistent RNA shedding.

Findings2425 tests were performed in 824 individuals, of which 52 (6.3%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive based on RT-qPCR. There were 2406 paired sets from asymptomatic subjects for analysis. Sixteen Panbio tests were inconclusive, for which sensitivity analyses were performed (considering results as either positive or negative or being excluded). Sensitivity of Panbio ranged from 61.76% (95% CI 49.2-73.3) to 69.12% (95% CI: 56.7-79.8) and specificity from 99.53% (95% CI: 99.2-99.8) to 100% (95% CI: 99.8-100). Sensitivity of Panbio to detect subjects with pre-symptomatic/early infection (n= 42) ranged from 81.82% (95% CI: 67.3-91.8) to 90.91% (95% CI: 78.3-97.5) with specificity always above 99%.

InterpretationIn asymptomatic subjects the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test had sensitivity of 81.82% to 90.91% and specificity above 99% for identifying pre-symptomatic and early SARS-CoV-2 infection.

21973,"Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among farmworkers in Monterey County, California","ImportanceEssential workers in agriculture and food production have been severely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

ObjectiveTo identify risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 shedding and antibody response in farmworkers in California.

DesignThis cross-sectional study collected survey data and determined current SARS-CoV-2 shedding and seropositivity among 1,107 farmworkers in Californias Salinas Valley from 16 July to 30 November 2020.

SettingFarmworkers receiving transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection at federally qualified community clinics and community sites were invited to participate in our study.

ParticipantsIndividuals were eligible if they were not pregnant, [&ge;]18 years old, had conducted farm work since the pandemic started, and were proficient in English or Spanish.

ExposuresSociodemographic, household, community, and workplace characteristics.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Current (as indicated by TMA positivity) and historical (as indicated by IgG seropositivity) SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsMost farmworkers enrolled in the study were born in Mexico, had primary school or lower levels of educational attainment, and were overweight or obese. Current SARS-CoV-2 shedding was associated in multivariable analyses with attained only primary or lower educational levels (RR=1.32; 95% CI: 0.99-1.76), speaking an indigenous language at home (RR=1.30; 0.97-1.73), working in the fields (RR=1.60; 1.03-2.50), and exposure to known or suspected COVID-19 case at home (RR=2.98; 2.06-4.32) or in the workplace (RR=1.59; 1.18-2.14). Antibody detection was associated with residential exposures including living in crowded housing (RR=1.23; 0.98-1.53), with children (RR=1.40; 1.1-1.76) or unrelated roommates (RR=1.40; 1.19-1.64), and with a known or suspected COVID-19 case (RR=1.59; 1.13-2.24). Those who were obese (RR=1.65; 1.01-2.70) or diabetic (RR=1.31; 0.98-1.75) were also more likely to be seropositive. Farmworkers who lived in rural areas other than Greenfield (RR=0.58; 0.47-0.71), worked indoors (RR=0.68; 0.61-0.77), or whose employer provided them with information on how to protect themselves at work (RR=0.59; 0.40-0.86) had lower risk of prior infection.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings suggest both residential and workplace exposures are contributing to SARS-CoV-2 infection among farmworkers in California. Urgent distribution of COVID-19 vaccines is warranted given this populations increased risk of infection and the essential nature of their work.","Mora, A. M.; Lewnard, J.

17253,Large-scale population analysis of SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences reveals host-mediated viral evolution with emergence of mutations in the viral Spike protein associated with elevated mortality rates,"BackgroundWe aimed to further characterize and analyze in depth intra-host variation and founder variants of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide up until August 2020, by examining in excess of 94,000 SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences in order to understand SARS-CoV-2 variant evolution, how these variants arose and identify any increased mortality associated with these variants.

Methods and FindingsWe combined worldwide sequencing data from GISAID and Sequence Read Archive (SRA) repositories and discovered SARS-CoV-2 hypermutation occurring in less than 2% of COVID19 patients, likely caused by host mechanisms involved APOBEC3G complexes and intra-host microdiversity. Most of this intra-host variation occurring in SARS-CoV-2 are predicted to change viral proteins with defined variant signatures, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 can be actively shaped by the host immune system to varying degrees. At the global population level, several SARS-CoV-2 proteins such as Nsp2, 3C-like proteinase, ORF3a and ORF8 are under active evolution, as evidenced by their increased {pi}N/ {pi}S ratios per geographical region. Importantly, two emergent variants: V1176F in co-occurrence with D614G mutation in the viral Spike protein, and S477N, located in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike protein, are associated with high fatality rates and are increasingly spreading throughout the world. The S477N variant arose quickly in Australia and experimental data support that this variant increases Spike protein fitness and its binding to ACE2.

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 is evolving non-randomly, and human hosts shape emergent variants with positive fitness that can easily spread into the population. We propose that V1776F and S477N variants occurring in the Spike protein are two novel mutations occurring in SARS-CoV-2 and may pose significant public health concerns in the future.

Author SummaryWe have developed an efficient bioinformatics pipeline that has allowed us obtain the most complete picture to date of how the SARS-CoV-2 virus has changed during the last eight month global pandemic and will continue to change in the near future. We characterized the importance of the host immune response in shaping viral variants at different degrees, evidenced by hypermutation responses on SARS-CoV-2 in less than 2% of infections and positive selection of several viral proteins by geographical region. We underscore how human hosts are shaping emergent variants with positive fitness that can easily spread into the population, evidenced by variants V1176F and S477N, located in the stalk and receptor binding domains of the Spike protein, respectively. Variant V1176 is associated with increased mortality rates in Brazil and variant S477N is associated with increased mortality rates over the world. In addition, it has been experimentally demonstrated that S477N variant increase fitness of Spike protein and its binding with ACE2, thus predicting to increase virulence of SARS-CoV-2. This limits the concept of  herd immunity proposals and re-emphasize the need to limit the spread of the virus to avoid emergence of more virulent forms of SARS-CoV-2 that can spread worldwide.","Farkas, C.; Mella, A.; Haigh, J.

13635,GIS-based spatial modeling to identify factors affecting COVID-19 incidence rates in Bangladesh,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented shock throughout the world which leads to generate a massive social, human, and economic crisis. However, there is a lack of research on geographic modeling of COVID-19 as well as identification of contributory factors affecting the COVID-19 in the context of developing countries. To fulfill the gap, this study aimed to identify the potential factors affecting the COVID-19 incidence rates at the district-level in Bangladesh using spatial regression model (SRM). Therefore, data related to 32 demographic, economic, weather, built environment, health, and facilities related factors were collected and analyzed to explain the spatial variability of this disease incidence. Three global (Ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial lag model (SLM) and spatial error model (SEM)) and one local (geographically weighted regression (GWR)) SRMs were developed in this study. The results of the models showed that four factors significantly affected the COVID-19 incidence rates in Bangladesh. Those four factors are urban population percentage, monthly consumption, number of health workers, and distance from the capital. Among the four developed models, the GWR model performed the best in explaining the variation of COVID-19 incidence rates across Bangladesh with a R2 value of 78.6%. Findings from this research offer a better insight into the COVID-19 situation and would help to develop policies aimed to prevent the future epidemic crisis.","Rahman, M. H.; Zafri, N. M.; Ashik, F.

11720,Interpreting Deep Ensemble Learning through Radiologist Annotations for COVID-19 Detection in Chest Radiographs,"Data-driven deep learning (DL) methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrate promising performance in natural image computer vision tasks. However, using these models in medical computer vision tasks suffers from several limitations, viz., (i) adapting to visual characteristics that are unlike natural images; (ii) modeling random noise during training due to stochastic optimization and backpropagation-based learning strategy; (iii) challenges in explaining DL black-box behavior to support clinical decision-making; and (iv) inter-reader variability in the ground truth (GT) annotations affecting learning and evaluation. This study proposes a systematic approach to address these limitations for COVID-19 detection using chest X-rays (CXRs). Specifically, our contribution benefits from (i) pretraining specific to CXRs in transferring and fine-tuning the learned knowledge toward improving COVID-19 detection performance; (ii) using ensembles of the fine-tuned models to further improve performance compared to individual constituent models; (iii) performing statistical analyses at various learning stages to validate our claims; (iv) interpreting learned individual and ensemble model behavior through class-selective relevance mapping (CRM)-based region of interest (ROI) localization; (v) analyzing inter-reader variability and ensemble localization performance using Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE) methods. We observe that: (i) ensemble approaches improved classification and localization performance; and, (ii) inter-reader variability and performance level assessment helped guide algorithm design and parameter optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to construct ensembles, perform ensemble-based disease ROI localization, and analyze inter-reader variability and algorithm performance for COVID-19 detection in CXRs.","Rajaraman, S.; Sornapudi, S.; Alderson, P.

11889,Probabilistic approaches for classifying highly variable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses,"Serological studies are critical for understanding pathogen-specific immune responses and informing public health measures1,2. Here, we evaluate tandem IgM, IgG and IgA responses in a cohort of individuals PCR+ for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (n=105) representing different categories of disease severity, including mild and asymptomatic infections. All PCR+ individuals surveyed were IgG-positive against the virus spike (S) glycoprotein. Elevated Ab levels were associated with hospitalization, with IgA titers, increased circulating IL-6 and strong neutralizing responses indicative of intensive care status. Additional studies of healthy blood donors (n=1,000) and pregnant women (n=900), sampled weekly during the initial outbreak in Stockholm, Sweden (weeks 14-25, 2020), demonstrated that anti-viral IgG titers differed over 1,000-fold between seroconverters, highlighting the need for careful evaluation of assay cut-offs for individual measurements and accurate estimates of seroprevalence (SP). To provide a solution to this, we developed probabilistic machine learning approaches to assign likelihood of past infection without setting an assay cut-off, allowing for more quantitative individual and population-level Ab measures. Using these tools, that considered responses against both S and RBD, we report SARS-CoV-2 S-specific IgG in 6.8% of blood donors and pregnant women two months after the peak of spring COVID-19 deaths, with the SP curve and country death rate following similar trajectories.","Castro Dopico, X.; Hanke, L.; Sheward, D.

22266,Robust immune responses after one dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine dose in SARS-CoV-2 experienced individuals,"The use of COVID-19 vaccines will play a major role in helping to end the pandemic that has killed millions worldwide. COVID-19 vaccine candidates have resulted in robust humoral responses and protective efficacy in human trials, but efficacy trials excluded individuals with prior diagnosis of COVID-19. As a result, little is known about how immune responses induced by mRNA vaccine candidates differ in individuals who recovered from COVID-19. Here, we evaluated longitudinal immune responses to two-dose BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination in 13 adults who recovered from COVID-19, compared to 19 adults who did not have prior COVID-19 diagnosis. Consistent with prior studies of mRNA vaccines, we observed robust cytotoxic CD8 T cell responses in both cohorts. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals had progressive increases in humoral and antigen-specific antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses following each dose of vaccine, whereas SARS-CoV-2-experienced individuals demonstrated strong humoral and antigen-specific ASC responses to the first dose but muted responses to the second dose of the vaccine for the time points studied. Together, these data highlight the relevance of immunological history for understanding vaccine immune responses and may have significant implications for personalizing mRNA vaccination regimens used to prevent COVID-19.

5046,Clinical Characteristics of Hospitalized Covid-19 Patients in New York City,"BackgroundThe coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic is a global public health crisis, with over 1.6 million cases and 95,000 deaths worldwide. Data are needed regarding the clinical course of hospitalized patients, particularly in the United States.

MethodsDemographic, clinical, and outcomes data for patients admitted to five Mount Sinai Health System hospitals with confirmed Covid-19 between February 27 and April 2, 2020 were identified through institutional electronic health records. We conducted a descriptive study of patients who had in-hospital mortality or were discharged alive.

ResultsA total of 2,199 patients with Covid-19 were hospitalized during the study period. As of April 2nd, 1,121 (51%) patients remained hospitalized, and 1,078 (49%) completed their hospital course. Of the latter, the overall mortality was 29%, and 36% required intensive care. The median age was 65 years overall and 75 years in those who died. Pre-existing conditions were present in 65% of those who died and 46% of those discharged. In those who died, the admission median lymphocyte percentage was 11.7%, D-dimer was 2.4 ug/ml, C-reactive protein was 162 mg/L, and procalcitonin was 0.44 ng/mL. In those discharged, the admission median lymphocyte percentage was 16.6%, D-dimer was 0.93 ug/ml, C-reactive protein was 79 mg/L, and procalcitonin was 0.09 ng/mL.

ConclusionsThis is the largest and most diverse case series of hospitalized patients with Covid-19 in the United States to date. Requirement of intensive care and mortality were high. Patients who died typically had pre-existing conditions and severe perturbations in inflammatory markers.","Paranjpe, I.; Russak, A.; De Freitas, J. K.; Lala, A.; Miotto, R.; Vaid, A.; Johnson, K.

26664,HLA-B*15:01 is associated with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundEvidence has shown that a large proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals do not experience symptomatic disease. Owing to its critical role in immune response, we hypothesized that variation in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci may underly asymptomatic infection.

MethodsWe enrolled 29,947 individuals registered in the National Marrow Donor Program for whom high-resolution HLA genotyping data were available in a smartphone-based study designed to track COVID-19 symptoms and outcomes. Among 21,893 individuals who completed the baseline survey, our discovery (N=640) and replication (N=788) cohorts were comprised of self-identified White subjects who reported a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2. We tested for association of five HLA loci (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1) with asymptomatic vs. symptomatic infection.

ResultsHLA-B*15:01 was significantly increased in asymptomatic individuals in the discovery cohort compared to symptomatic (OR = 2.45; 95%CI 1.38-4.24, p = 0.0016, pcorr = 0.048), and we reproduced this association in the replication cohort (OR= 2.32; 95%CI = 1.10-4.43, p = 0.017). We found robust association of HLA-B*15:01 in the combined dataset (OR=2.40 95% CI = 1.54-3.64; p = 5.67 x10-5) and observed that homozygosity of this allele increases more than eight times the chance of remaining asymptomatic after SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR = 8.58, 95%CI = 1.74-34.43, p = 0.003). Finally, we demonstrated the association of HLA-B*15:01 with asymptomatic SARS-Cov-2 infection is enhanced by the presence of HLA-DRB1*04:01

ConclusionHLA-B*15:01 is strongly associated with asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 and is likely to be involved in the mechanism underlying early viral clearance.","Augusto, D.

12935,"A Comprehensive Analysis of COVID-19 Transmission and Fatality Rates at the County level in the United States considering Socio-Demographics, Health Indicators, Mobility Trends and Health Care Infrastructure Attributes","BackgroundSeveral research efforts have evaluated the impact of various factors including a) socio-demographics, (b) health indicators, (c) mobility trends, and (d) health care infrastructure attributes on COVID-19 transmission and mortality rate. However, earlier research focused only on a subset of variable groups (predominantly one or two) that can contribute to the COVID-19 transmission/mortality rate. The current study effort is designed to remedy this by analyzing COVID-19 transmission/mortality rates considering a comprehensive set of factors in a unified framework.

MethodWe study two per capita dependent variables: (1) daily COVID-19 transmission rates and (2) total COVID-19 mortality rates. The first variable is modeled using a linear mixed model while the later dimension is analyzed using a linear regression approach. The model results are augmented with a sensitivity analysis to predict the impact of mobility restrictions at a county level.

FindingsSeveral county level factors including proportion of African-Americans, income inequality, health indicators associated with Asthma, Cancer, HIV and heart disease, percentage of stay at home individuals, testing infrastructure and Intensive Care Unit capacity impact transmission and/or mortality rates. From the policy analysis, we find that enforcing a stay at home order that can ensure a 50% stay at home rate can result in a potential reduction of about 30% in daily cases.

InterpretationThe model framework developed can be employed by government agencies to evaluate the influence of reduced mobility on transmission rates at a county level while accommodating for various county specific factors. Based on our policy analysis, the study findings support a county level stay at home order for regions currently experiencing a surge in transmission. The model framework can also be employed to identify vulnerable counties that need to be prioritized based on health indicators for current support and/or preferential vaccination plans (when available).

FundingNone.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe conducted an exhaustive review of studies examining the factors affecting COVID-19 transmission and mortality rates at an aggregate spatial location such as national, regional, state, county, city and zip code levels. The review considered articles published in peer-reviewed journals (via PubMed and Web of Science) and working articles uploaded in preprint platforms (such as medRxiv). A majority of these studies focused on a small number of counties (up to 100 counties) and considered COVID-19 data only up to the month of April. While these studies are informative, cases in the US grew substantially in recent months. Further, earlier studies have considered factors selectively from the four variable groups - socio-demographics, health indicators, mobility trends, and health care infrastructure attributes. The exclusion of variables from these groups is likely to yield incorrect/biased estimates for the factors considered.

Added value of this studyThe proposed study enhances the coverage of COVID-19 data in our analysis. Spatially, we consider 1258 counties encompassing 87% of the total population and 96% of the total confirmed COVID-19 cases. Temporally, we consider data from March 25th to July 3rd, 2020. The model system developed comprehensively examines factors affecting COVID-19 from all four categories of variables described above. The county level daily transmission data has multiple observations for each county. To accommodate for these repeated measures, we employ a linear mixed modeling framework for model estimation. The model estimation results are augmented with policy scenarios imposing hypothetical mobility restrictions.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe proposed framework and the results can allow policy makers to (a) evaluate the influence of population behavior factors such as mobility trends on virus transmission (while accounting for other county level factors), (b) identify priority locations for health infrastructure support as the pandemic evolves, and (c) prioritize vulnerable counties across the country for vaccination (when available).","Bhowmik, T.; Tirtha, S.

One of the most affected populations by the pandemic are healthcare professionals. Thus, it is paramount to understand and categorize their perceived levels of stress, as it can be a detonating factor leading to mental illness. In our study, we used a machine learning prediction model to help measure perceived stress; a C5.0 decision tree algorithm was used to analyze and classify datasets obtained from healthcare professionals of the northeast region of Mexico. Our analysis showed that 6 out of 102 instances were incorrectly classified. Missing two cases for mild, three for moderate and 1 for severe (accuracy of 94.1%), statistical correlation analysis was performed to ensure integrity of the method, in addition we concluded that severe stress cases can be related mostly to high levels of Xenophobia and Compulsive stress.","Delgado-Gallegos, J.

26228,Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in COVID-19 patients and in-hospital mortality: results from the Brazilian Registry using a propensity score matched analysis,"Around 5% of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients develop critical disease, with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In these cases, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be considered when conventional therapy fails. This study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 patients with ARDS refractory to standard lung-protective ventilation and pronation treated with ECMO support and to compare them to patients who did not receive ECMO. Patients were selected from the Brazilian COVID-19 Registry. At the moment of the analysis, 7,646 patients were introduced in the registry, eight of those received ECMO support (0.1%). The convenience sample of patients submitted to ECMO was compared to control patients selected by genetic matching for gender, age, comorbidities, pronation, ARDS and hospital, in a 5:1 ratio. From the 48 patients included in the study, eight received ECMO and 40 were matched controls. There were no significant differences in demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics. Mortality was higher in the ECMO group (n = 7; 87.5%) when compared with controls (n = 17; 42.5%), (p=0.048). In conclusion, COVID 19 patients with ARDS refractory to conventional therapy who received ECMO support had worse outcomes to patients who did not receive ECMO. Our findings are not different from previous studies including a small number of patients, however there is a huge difference from Extracorporeal Life Support Organization results, which encourages us to keep looking for our best excellence.","Ponce, D.; Marcolino, M.

6648,Who can go back to work when the COVID-19 pandemic remits?,"This paper seeks to determine which workers affected by lockdown measures can return to work when a government decides to apply lockdown exit strategies. This system, which we call Sequential Selective Multidimensional Decision (SSMD), involves deciding sequentially, by geographical areas, sectors of activity, age groups and immunity, which workers can return to work at a given time according to the epidemiological criteria of the country as well as that of a group of reference countries, used as a benchmark, that have suffered a lower level of lockdown de-escalation strategies.

17112,An Empirical Inference of the Severity of Resurgence of COVID-19 in Europe,"In Europe the Corona Virus spread had started to retard months ago, but after some time it has started to accelerate again. In this article, we are going to analyze the current COVID-19 spread patterns in Italy, the UK, Germany, Russia, Spain and France. We have found that the current spread has perhaps been underestimated as just the second wave. As per our analysis, as on 7 October the resurgence is much more vigorous than the first wave of spread of the disease. It is going to be most serious in Russia, followed by Italy, Germany and the UK, while in Spain and France the patterns are yet to take inferable shapes.","Baruah, H.

20780,The incremental value of computed tomography of COVID-19 pneumonia in predicting ICU admission,"RationaleTriage is crucial for patients management and estimation of the required Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds is fundamental for Health Systems during the COVID-19 pandemic.

ObjectiveTo assess whether chest Computed Tomography (CT) of COVID-19 pneumonia has an incremental role in predicting patients admission to ICU.

MethodsWe performed volumetric and texture analysis of the areas of the affected lung in CT of 115 outpatients with COVID-19 infection presenting to the Emergency Room with dyspnea and unresponsive hypoxyemia. Admission blood laboratory including lymphocyte count, serum lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer and C-Reactive Protein and the ratio between the arterial partial pressure of oxygen and inspired oxygen were collected. By calculating the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC), we compared the performance of blood laboratory-arterial gas analyses features alone and combined with the CT features in two hybrid models (Hybrid radiological and Hybrid radiomics)for predicting ICU admission. Following a machine learning approach, 63 patients were allocated to the training and 52 to the validation set.

Measurements and Main ResultsTwenty-nine (25%) of patients were admitted to ICU. The Hybrid radiological model comprising the lung %consolidation performed significantly (p=0.04) better in predicting ICU admission in the validation (AUC=0.82; 95%Confidence Interval 0.68-0.95) set than the blood laboratory-arterial gas analyses features alone (AUC=0.71; 95%Confidence Interval 0.56-0.86). A risk calculator for ICU admission was derived and is available at:https://github.com/cgplab/covidapp

ConclusionsThe volume of the consolidated lung in CT of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia has a mild but significant incremental value in predicting ICU admission.","Bartolucci, M.; Benelli, M.; Betti, M.; Bicchi, S.; Fedeli, L.; Giannelli, F.; Aquilini, D.; Baldini, A.; Consales, G.; Di Natale, M.

Our identification approach exploits regional variation in the point in time when face masks became compulsory. Depending on the region we analyse, we find that face masks reduced the cumulative number of registered Covid-19 cases between 2.3% and 13% over a period of 10 days after they became compulsory.

7636,A data-driven method to detect the flattening of the COVID-19 pandemic curve and estimating its ending life-cycle using only the time-series of new cases per day.,"The novel Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) has emerged as a pandemic and has presented itself as an unprecedented challenge to the majority of countries worldwide. The containment measures for this disease such as the requirement of health care facilities greatly rely on estimating the future dynamics and flattening of the COVID-19 curve. However, it is always challenging to estimate the future trends and flattening of the COVID-19 curve due to the involvement of many real-life variables. Recently, traditional methods based on SIR and SEIR have been presented for predictive monitoring and detection of flattening of the COVID-19 curve. In this paper, a novel method for detection of flattening of the COVID-19 curve and its ending life-cycle using only the time-series of new cases per day is presented. Simulation results are compared to the SIR based methods in three different scenarios using COVID-19 curves for South Korea, the United States of America, and India. In this study, simulations, performed on the 26th April 2020 show that the peak of the COVID-19 curve in the USA has already arrived and situated on the 14th of April 2020, while the peak of the COVID-19 curve for India has yet to arrive.","Gupta, D.

5881,Enhanced Contact Investigations for Nine Early Travel-Related Cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, China and has since become pandemic. As part of initial response activities in the United States, enhanced contact investigations were conducted to enable early identification and isolation of additional cases and to learn more about risk factors for transmission.

MethodsClose contacts of nine early travel-related cases in the United States were identified. Close contacts meeting criteria for active monitoring were followed, and selected individuals were targeted for collection of additional exposure details and respiratory samples. Respiratory samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

ResultsThere were 404 close contacts who underwent active monitoring in the response jurisdictions; 338 had at least basic exposure data, of whom 159 had [&ge;]1 set of respiratory samples collected and tested. Across all known close contacts under monitoring, two additional cases were identified; both secondary cases were in spouses of travel-associated case patients. The secondary attack rate among household members, all of whom had [&ge;]1 respiratory sample tested, was 13% (95% CI: 4 - 38%).

ConclusionsThe enhanced contact tracing investigations undertaken around nine early travel-related cases of COVID-19 in the United States identified two cases of secondary transmission, both spouses. Rapid detection and isolation of the travel-associated case patients, enabled by public awareness of COVID-19 among travelers from China, may have mitigated transmission risk among close contacts of these cases.","Burke, R.

12819,Land Use Change and Coronavirus Emergence Risk,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) causing coronaviruses are mostly discovered in Asian horseshoe bats. It is still unclear how ongoing land use changes may facilitate SARS-related coronavirus transmission to humans. Here we use a multivariate hotspot analysis of high-resolution land-use data to show that regions of China populated by horseshoe bats are hotspots of forest fragmentation, livestock and human density. We also identify areas susceptible to new hotspot emergence in response to moderate expansion of urbanization, livestock production, or forest disturbance, thereby highlighting regions vulnerable to SARS-CoV spillover under future land-use change. In China population growth and increasing meat consumption associated with urbanization and economic development have expanded the footprint of agriculture, leading to human encroachment in wildlife habitat and increased livestock density in areas adjacent to fragmented forests. The reduced distance between horseshoe-bats and humans elevates the risk for SARS-related coronavirus transmission to humans.

26109,"Women's views on accepting COVID-19 vaccination during and after pregnancy, and for their babies: A multi-methods study in the UK.","BackgroundCOVID-19 vaccines are the cornerstone of the pandemic response and now advised for pregnant women in the United Kingdom(UK) however COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among pregnant women is unknown.

MethodsAn online survey and semi-structured interviews were used to investigate pregnant womens views on COVID-19 vaccine acceptability for themselves when pregnant, not pregnant and for their babies. 1,181 women, aged over 16 years, who had been pregnant since 23rd March 2020, were surveyed between 3rd August-11th October 2020. Ten women were interviewed.

ResultsThe majority of women surveyed (81.2%) reported that they would  definitely or were  leaning towards accepting a COVID-19 vaccine when not pregnant. COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was significantly lower during pregnancy (62.1%, p<0.005) and for their babies (69.9%, p<0.005). Ethnic minority women were twice as likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves when not pregnant, pregnant and for their babies compared to women from White ethnic groups (p<0.005). Women from lower-income households, aged under 25-years, and from some geographic regions were more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine when not pregnant, pregnant and for their babies. Multivariate analysis revealed that income and ethnicity were the main drivers of the observed age and regional differences. Women unvaccinated against pertussis in pregnancy were over four times more likely to reject COVID-19 vaccines when not pregnant, pregnant and for their babies. Thematic analysis of the survey freetext responses and interviews found safety concerns about COVID-19 vaccines were common though wider mistrust in vaccines was also expressed. Trust in vaccines and the health system were also reasons women gave for accepting COVID-19 vaccines.

ConclusionSafety information on COVID-19 vaccines must be clearly communicated to pregnant women to provide reassurance and facilitate informed pregnancy vaccine decisions. Targeted interventions to promote COVID-19 vaccine uptake among ethnic minority and lower-income women may be needed.","Skirrow, H.; Barnett, S.; Bell, S.

23366,Modeling transmission dynamics and effectiveness of worker screening programs for SARS-CoV-2 in pork processing plants,"Pork processing plants were apparent hotspots for SARS-CoV2 in the spring of 2020. As a result, the swine industry was confronted with a major occupational health, financial, and animal welfare crisis. The objective of this work was to describe the epidemiological situation within processing plants, develop mathematical models to simulate transmission in these plants, and test the effectiveness of routine PCR screening at minimizing SARS-CoV2 circulation. Cumulative incidence of clinical (PCR-confirmed) disease plateaued at [~]2.5% to 25% across the three plants studied here. For larger outbreaks, antibody prevalence was approximately 30% to 40%. Secondly, we developed a mathematical model that accounts for asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and background """"community"""" transmission. By calibrating this model to observed epidemiological data, we estimated the initial reproduction number (R) of the virus. Across plants, R generally ranged between 2 and 4 during the initial phase, but subsequently declined to [~]1 after two to three weeks, most likely as a result of implementation/compliance with biosecurity measures in combination with population immunity. Using the calibrated model to simulate a range of possible scenarios, we show that the effectiveness of routine PCR-screening at minimizing disease spread was far more influenced by testing frequency than by delays in results, R, or background community transmission rates. Testing every three days generally averted about 25% to 40% of clinical cases across a range of assumptions, while testing every 14 days typically averted 7 to 13% of clinical cases. However, the absolute number of additional clinical cases expected and averted was influenced by whether there was residual immunity from a previous peak (i.e., routine testing is implemented after the workforce had experienced an initial outbreak). In contrast, when using PCR-screening to prevent outbreaks or in the early stages of an outbreak, even frequent testing may not prevent a large outbreak within the workforce. This research helps to identify protocols that minimize risk to occupational safety and health and support continuity of business for U.S. processing plants. While the model was calibrated to meat processing plants, the structure of the model and insights about testing are generalizable to other settings where large number of people work in close proximity.","Vanderwaal, K.; Black, L.; Hodge, J.; Bedada, A.; Dee, S.",2021-03-05,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.03.02.21249552,1,Kimberly Vanderwaal,University of Minnesota,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.02.21249552v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.02.21249552v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"

We assessed the recognition of three variants of concern (B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1) in cohorts of COVID-19 patients ranging in disease severity (n = 69) and recipients of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (n = 50). Spike binding and neutralization against all three VOC was substantially reduced in the majority of samples, with the largest 4-7-fold reduction in neutralization being observed against B.1.351. While hospitalized COVID-19 patients and vaccinees maintained sufficient neutralizing titers against all three VOC, 39% of non-hospitalized patients did not neutralize B.1.351. Moreover, monoclonal neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) show sharp reductions in their binding kinetics and neutralizing potential to B.1.351 and P.1, but not to B.1.1.7. These data have implications for the degree to which pre-existing immunity can protect against subsequent infection with VOC and informs policy makers of susceptibility to globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 VOC.","Caniels, T.

2403,Analysis of early renal injury in COVID-19 and diagnostic value of multi-index combined detection,"ObjectivesThe aim of the study was to analyze the incidence of COVID-19 with early renal injury, and to explore the value of multi-index combined detection in diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19.

DesignThe study was an observational, descriptive study.

SettingThis study was carried out in a tertiary hospital in Guangdong, China.

Participants12 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 20, 2020 to February 20, 2020.

Primary and secondary outcome measuresThe primary outcome was to evaluate the incidence of early renal injury in COVID-19. In this study, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) and urine microalbumin / urinary creatinine ratio (UACR) were calculated to assess the incidence of early renal injury. Secondary outcomes were the diagnostic value of urine microalbumin (UMA), 1-microglobulin (A1M), urine immunoglobulin-G (IGU), urine transferring (TRU) alone and in combination in diagnosis of COVID-19 with early renal injury.

ResultsWhile all patients had no significant abnormalities in serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), the abnormal rates of eGFR, Ccr, and UACR were 66.7%, 41.7%, and 41.7%, respectively. Urinary microprotein detection indicated that the area under curve (AUC) of multi-index combined to diagnose early renal injury in COVID-19 was 0.875, which was higher than UMA (0,813), A1M (0.813), IGU (0.750) and TRU (0.750) alone. Spearman analysis showed that the degree of early renal injury was significantly related to C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil ratio (NER), suggesting that the more severe the infection, the more obvious the early renal injury. Hypokalemia and hyponatremia were common in patients with COVID-19, and there was a correlation with the degree of renal injury.

ConclusionsEarly renal injury was common in patients with COVID-19. Combined detection of UMA, A1M, IGU, and TRU was helpful for the diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19.","Hong, X.-W.; Chi, Z.-P.; Liu, G.-Y.; Huang, H.; Guo, S.-Q.; Fan, J.-R.; Lin, X.-W.; Qu, L.-Z.; Chen, R.-L.; Wu, L.-J.; Wang, L.-Y.; Zhang, Q.-C.; Wu, S.-W.; Pan, Z.-Q.; Lin, H.; Zhou, Y.-H.; Zhang, Y.-H.",2020-03-12,Nephrology,10.1101/2020.03.07.20032599,2,Yong-Hai Zhang,Shantou Central Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.07.20032599v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.07.20032599v2.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
17847,Shorter androgen receptor polyQ alleles protect against life-threatening COVID-19 disease in males.,"BackgroundCOVID-19 presentation ranges from asymptomatic to fatal. The variability in severity may be due in part to impaired Interferon type I response due to specific mutations in the host genome or to autoantibodies, explaining about 15% of the cases when combined. Exploring the host genome is thus warranted to further elucidate disease variability.

MethodsWe developed a synthetic approach to genetic data representation using machine learning methods to investigate complementary genetic variability in COVID-19 infected patients that may explain disease severity, due to poly-amino acids repeat polymorphisms. Using host whole-exome sequencing data, we compared extreme phenotypic presentations (338 severe versus 300 asymptomatic cases) of the entire (men and women) Italian GEN-COVID cohort of 1178 subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2. We then applied the LASSO Logistic Regression model on Boolean gene-based representation of the poly-amino acids variability.

FindingsShorter polyQ alleles ([&le;]22) in the androgen receptor (AR) conferred protection against a more severe outcome in COVID-19 infection. In the subgroup of males with age <60 years, testosterone was higher in subjects with AR long-polyQ ([&ge;]23), possibly indicating receptor resistance (p=0.004 Mann-Whitney U test). Inappropriately low testosterone levels for the long-polyQ alleles predicted the need for intensive care in COVID-19 infected men. In agreement with the known anti-inflammatory action of testosterone, patients with long-polyQ ([&ge;]23) and age>60 years had increased levels of C Reactive Protein (p=0.018).

InterpretationOur results may contribute to design reliable clinical and public health measures and provide a rationale to test testosterone treatment as adjuvant therapy in symptomatic COVID-19 men expressing AR polyQ longer than 23 repeats.

BoxesO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched on Medline, EMBASE, and Pubmed for articles published from January 2020 to August 2020 using various combinations of the search terms """"sex-difference"""", """"gender"""" AND SARS-Cov-2, or COVID. Epidemiological studies indicate that men and women are similarly infected by COVID-19, but the outcome is less favorable in men, independently of age. Several studies also showed that patients with hypogonadism tend to be more severely affected. A prompt intervention directed toward the most fragile subjects with SARS-Cov2 infection is currently the only strategy to reduce mortality. glucocorticoid treatment has been found cost-effective in improving the outcome of severe cases. Clinical algorithms have been proposed, but little is known on the ability of genetic profiling to predict outcome and disclose novel therapeutic strategies.

Added-value of this studyIn a cohort of 1178 men and women with COVID-19, we used a supervised machine learning approach on a synthetic representation of the uncovered variability of the human genome due to poly-amino acid repeats. Comparing the genotype of patients with extreme manifestations (severe vs. asymptomatic), we found that the poly-glutamine repeat of the androgen receptor (AR) gene is relevant for COVID-19 disease and defective AR signaling identifies an association between male sex, testosterone exposure, and COVID-19 outcome. Failure of the endocrine feedback to overcome AR signaling defect by increasing testosterone levels during the infection leads to the fact that polyQ becomes dominant to T levels for the clinical outcome.

Implications of all the available evidenceWe identify the first genetic polymorphism predisposing some men to develop a more severe disease irrespectively of age. Based on this, we suggest that sizing the AR poly-glutamine repeat has important implications in the diagnostic pipeline of patients affected by life-threatening COVID-19 infection. Most importantly, our studies open to the potential of using testosterone as adjuvant therapy for severe COVID-19 patients having defective androgen signaling, defined by this study as [&ge;]23 PolyQ repeats and inappropriate levels of circulating androgens.","Baldassarri, M.; Picchiotti, N.; Fava, F.; Fallerini, C.; Benetti, E.; Daga, S.; Valentino, F.; Doddato, G.; Furini, S.; Giliberti, A.; Tita, R.; Amitrano, S.; Bruttini, M.; Croci, S.; Meloni, I.; Pinto, A.

Subjects/MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, 66 patients were remotely (via phone call) and in-person (by home visit) assessed for health status and lifestyle habits. Results: Mean age was 47.4 years. Patients were obese grade I (30.0%), II (22.0%), and III (30.0%), and 94.2% had above reference waist circumference values. Sixty-four percent displayed high blood pressure, whereas 24% showed CRP levels above normal range. Nineteen percent of patients reported irregular use of nutritional supplementation and 6.0% reported binge eating habits. Thirty-three exhibited symptoms of depression. Mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms were reported by 27.4% and 11.3% of the patients; 4.5% exhibited suicidal ideation and were referred to a specialist for healthcare. Of relevance, inactive patients (59.6%) had poorer global mental and physical health scores as compared to active peers (both p<0.05). Conclusion: This out-of-hospital screening revealed that the absence of face-to-face health care due to the Covid-19 pandemic is associated with suboptimal status of physical and mental health as well as lifestyle inadequacies among patients who have recently undergone bariatric surgery.

20352,"Understanding Covid-19 misinformation and vaccine hesitancy in context: Findings from a qualitative study involving citizens in Bradford, UK","BackgroundCovid-19 vaccines can offer a route out of the pandemic, yet initial research suggests that many are unwilling to be vaccinated. A rise in the spread of misinformation is thought to have played a significant role in this vaccine hesitancy. In order to maximise vaccine uptake it is important to understand why misinformation has been able to take hold at this time and why it may pose a more significant problem within certain populations and places.

ObjectiveTo understand peoples Covid-19 beliefs, their interactions with health (mis)information during Covid-19 and attitudes towards a Covid-19 vaccine.

Design and participantsIn-depth phone interviews were carried out with 20 people from different ethnic groups and areas of Bradford during Autumn 2020. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted.

ResultsParticipants spoke about a wide range of emotive misinformation they had encountered regarding Covid-19, resulting in confusion, distress and mistrust. Vaccine hesitancy could be attributed to three prominent factors: safety concerns, negative stories and personal knowledge. The more confused, distressed and mistrusting participants felt about their social worlds during the pandemic, the less positive they were about a vaccine.

ConclusionsCovid-19 vaccine hesitancy needs to be understood in the context of the relationship between the spread of misinformation and associated emotional reactions. Vaccine programmes should provide a focused, localised and empathetic response to counter misinformation.

Patient or public contributionA rapid community and stakeholder engagement process was undertaken to identify Covid-19 related priority topics important to both Bradford citizens and local decision makers.","Lockyer, B.; Islam, S.; Rahman, A.; Dickerson, J.; Pickett, K.; Sheldon, T.; Wright, J.; Mceachan, R.; Sheard, L.",2020-12-26,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.12.22.20248259,1,Bridget Lockyer,"Bradford Institute for Health Research, Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.22.20248259v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.22.20248259v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1111/hex.13240
24329,Estimating the impact of interventions against COVID-19: from lockdown to vaccination,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease of humans caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the first case was identified in China in December 2019 the disease has spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic. In this article, we present a detailed agent-based model of COVID-19 in Luxembourg, and use it to estimate the impact, on cases and deaths, of interventions including testing, contact tracing, lockdown, curfew and vaccination.

Our model is based on collation, with agents performing activities and moving between locations accordingly. The model is highly heterogeneous, featuring spatial clustering, over 2000 behavioural types and a 10 minute time resolution. The model is validated against COVID-19 clinical monitoring data collected in Luxembourg in 2020.

Our model predicts far fewer cases and deaths than the equivalent equation-based SEIR model. In particular, with R0 = 2.45, the SEIR model infects 87% of the resident population while our agent-based model results, on average, in only around 23% of the resident population infected. Our simulations suggest that testing and contract tracing reduce cases substantially, but are much less effective at reducing deaths. Lockdowns appear very effective although costly, while the impact of an 11pm-6am curfew is relatively small. When vaccinating against a future outbreak, our results suggest that herd immunity can be achieved at relatively low levels, with substantial levels of protection achieved with only 30% of the population immune. When vaccinating in midst of an outbreak, the challenge is more difficult. In this context, we investigate the impact of vaccine efficacy, capacity, hesitancy and strategy.

We conclude that, short of a permanent lockdown, vaccination is by far the most effective way to suppress and ultimately control the spread of COVID-19.","Thompson, J.; Wattam, S.",2021-03-26,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.03.21.21254049,1,James Thompson,The Alan Turing Institute,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.21.21254049v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.21.21254049v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
18019,A shorter symptom-onset to remdesivir treatment (SORT) interval is associated with a lower mortality in moderate-to-severe COVID-19: A real-world analysis,"BackgroundRemdesivir is the current recommended anti-viral treatment in moderate-to-severe COVID-19. However, data on several aspects of its use such as impact of timing of therapy, efficacy, and safety in this severity category are limited. The current study aimed to evaluate the impact of timing of remdesivir initiation (symptom-onset to remdesivir treatment [SORT] interval) on in-hospital all-cause mortality in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19.

MethodsThis retrospective study was conducted between June 25, 2020 and October 3, 2020, at a tertiary care dedicated COVID center in India. Consecutive patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 (moderate: SpO2 <94%; severe: SpO2 <90%) were included. Data were collected from the health records of the hospital. Remdesivir was administered along with other standard medications as per protocol. The main outcome was the impact of SORT interval on in-hospital all-cause mortality. Subgroups were formed based on SORT interval. Other measures analyzed included overall in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, and safety.

ResultsOf 350 patients treated with remdesivir, 346 were included for the final analysis (males: 270 [78.0%]; median [range] age: 60 [24-94] years). Overall, 243 (70.2%) patients had [&ge;]1 comorbidity; 109 (31.5%) patients had moderate disease, 237 (68.5%) had severe disease, and 50 (14.5%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Of the 346 patients, 76 (22.0%) patients died (moderate: 3 [2.8%], severe: 73 [30.8%]). In the subset of mechanically ventilated patients, 43 (86.0%) died. All-cause mortality was significantly lower in patients with SORT interval [&le;]9 days (n = 260) compared with those with SORT interval >9 days (n = 86; 18.1% vs 33.7%; P = .004). The odds of death were significantly lower in patients with SORT interval [&le;]9 days vs >9 days (odds ratio = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.25-0.76; P = .004). Adverse events (transaminitis [&ge;]5 times upper limit of normal or estimated glomerular filtration rate <30ml/min) leading to drug discontinuation were seen in 4 (1.1%) patients.

ConclusionIn this large series of moderate-to-severe COVID-19, initiation of remdesivir [&le;]9 days from symptom-onset was associated with a significant mortality benefit. These findings indicate a treatment window and reinforce the need for earlier remdesivir initiation in moderate-to-severe COVID-19 infection.","Mehta, R.

17774,SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence and symptoms in a local Austrian population,"BackgroundSince December 2019 the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is the center of global attention due to its rapid transmission and toll on health care systems and global economy. Population-based serosurveys measuring antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 provide one method for estimating infection rates and monitoring the progression of the epidemic.

MethodsIn June 2020 we succeeded in testing almost half of the population of an Austrian township (n=835 of 1359 inhabitants) with a reported higher incidence for COVID-19 infections. We determined the level of prevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in this population, factors affecting, and symptoms correlated with prior infection.

ResultsWe found a high prevalence of 9% positive antibodies among the town population in comparison to 6% of the neighboring villages. Only 20% of SARS-CoV-2 cases self-declared being asymptomatic. In contrast, we identified six single major symptoms, including anosmia/ageusia, weight loss, anorexia, general debility, dyspnea, and fever, and especially their combination to be of high prognostic value for predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient. Our comparison of the gold standard lab-based ELISA test and the on-site antibody test demonstrated a lack of accuracy for the latter test form.

ConclusionsThis population study demonstrated a high prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as a marker of both active and past infections in an Austrian township. Several symptoms revealed a diagnostic value especially in combination. Results from self-administered antibody tests should be considered with caution.","Ladage, D.; Hoeglinger, Y.; Ladage, D.; Adler, C.; Yalcin, I.; Braun, R.",2020-11-04,Respiratory Medicine,10.1101/2020.11.03.20219121,1,Dennis Ladage,Kliniken Maria Hilf,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.03.20219121v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.03.20219121v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3389/fmed.2021.632942
23278,"Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 in Slovakia using a novel, multiplexed RT-qPCR assay","The emergence of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant called lineage B.1.1.7 sparked global alarm due to evidence of increased transmissibility, mortality, and uncertainty about vaccine efficacy, thus accelerating efforts to detect and track the variant. Current approaches to detect lineage B.1.1.7 include sequencing and RT-qPCR tests containing a target assay that fails or results in reduced sensitivity towards the B.1.1.7 variant. Since many countries lack robust genomic surveillance programs and failed assays detect multiple unrelated variants containing similar mutations as B.1.1.7, we sought to develop an RT-qPCR test that can accurately and rapidly differentiate the B.1.1.7 variant from other SARS-CoV-2 variants. We used bioinformatics, allele-specific PCR, and judicious placement of LNA-modified nucleotides to develop a test that differentiates B.1.1.7 from other SARS-CoV-2 variants. We validated the test on 106 clinical samples with lineage status confirmed by sequencing. Our room temperature-stable, multiplexed RT-qPCR test consists of two assays that target either the common SARS-CoV-2 spike gene or spike gene deletions specific to lineage B.1.1.7. A simple relative comparison of the Ct values of the two assays permits not only identification of the B.1.1.7 variant but also its differentiation from other variants that harbor only the {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70 deletion.The test showed 97% clinical sensitivity at detecting lineage B.1.1.7. This test can easily be implemented in labs to rapidly scale B.1.1.7 surveillance efforts and is particularly useful in countries with high prevalence of variants possessing only the {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70 deletion because current strategies using target failure assays incorrectly identify these as putative B.1.1.7 variants.","Kovacova, V.; Borsova, K.; Paul, E.

22538,Multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants escape neutralization by vaccine-induced humoral immunity,"Vaccination elicits immune responses capable of potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. However, ongoing surveillance has revealed the emergence of variants harboring mutations in spike, the main target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the impact of globally circulating variants, we evaluated the neutralization potency of 48 sera from BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients against pseudoviruses bearing spike proteins derived from 10 strains of SARS-CoV-2. While multiple strains exhibited vaccine-induced cross-neutralization comparable to wild-type pseudovirus, 5 strains harboring receptor-binding domain mutations, including K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y, were highly resistant to neutralization. Cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variants was weak and comparable to SARS-CoV and bat-derived WIV1-CoV, suggesting that a relatively small number of mutations can mediate potent escape from vaccine responses. While the clinical impact of neutralization resistance remains uncertain, these results highlight the potential for variants to escape from neutralizing humoral immunity and emphasize the need to develop broadly protective interventions against the evolving pandemic.","Garcia-Beltran, W.

19410,"Multifaceted strategies for the control of COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care facilities in Ontario, Canada","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused severe outbreaks in Canadian long-term care facilities (LTCFs). In Canada, over 80% of COVID-19 deaths during the first pandemic wave occurred in LTCFs. We sought to evaluate the effect of mitigation measures in LTCFs including frequent testing of staff, and vaccination of staff and residents. We developed an agent-based transmission model and parameterized it with disease-specific estimates, temporal sensitivity of nasopharyngeal and saliva testing, results of vaccine efficacy trials, and data from initial COVID-19 outbreaks in LTCFs in Ontario, Canada. Characteristics of staff and residents, including contact patterns, were integrated into the model with age-dependent risk of hospitalization and death. Estimates of infection and outcomes were obtained and 95% credible intervals were generated using a bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap method. Weekly routine testing of staff with 2-day turnaround time reduced infections among residents by at least 25.9% (95% CrI: 23.3% - 28.3%), compared to baseline measures of mask-wearing, symptom screening, and staff cohorting alone. A similar reduction of hospitalizations and deaths was achieved in residents. Vaccination averted 2-4 times more infections in both staff and residents as compared to routine testing, and markedly reduced hospitalizations and deaths among residents by 95.9% (95% CrI: 95.4% - 96.3%) and 95.8% (95% CrI: 95.5% - 96.1%), respectively, over 200 days from the start of vaccination. Vaccination could have a substantial impact on mitigating disease burden among residents, but may not eliminate the need for other measures before population-level control of COVID-19 is achieved.","Vilches, T.

23526,"Low Dose Regimens of BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine Exceed SARS-Cov-2 Correlate of Protection Estimates for Symptomatic Infection, in those 19-55 Years of Age","BackgroundAn exact correlate of protection (CoP) is not yet known for symptomatic COVID-19. However, it is still possible to show a new vaccine regimen exceeds an unknown CoP, provided the regimen shows an equivalent or greater immunological response in all measured indicators relative to the immunological response elicited by a clinically proven vaccine regimen. The principle of comparing immunogenicity between regimens is what the FDA, EMA, and Access Consortium use to authorize modifications to the vaccines for VOC, without requiring clinical efficacy studies before implementation. It is logical to apply the same principle to modifying vaccine doses if the data is available to do so. A two dose 30ug regimen of BNT162b2 has strong clinical evidence of efficacy, as does a single dose 30 ug regimen. The immunological markers for these regimens have been profiled in detail in Phase 1 and 2 trial data.

MethodsThe immunological profile (including binding antibodies, viral neutralization, cytokine profiles, and CD4 and 8 expansion) of the 2 dose 30ug BNT162b2 vaccine is examined, referred to as a highly conservative CoP estimate. The single dose 30 ug BNT162b2 immunological profile is also examined, a tenable CoP estimate. Data from the phase 1 and 2 trials are examined to see if alternate regimens meet or exceed the level of each immune marker measured, relative to the regimens listed above that have proven clinical efficacy.

ResultsFor adults aged 19-55, a 2 dose 10ug BNT162b2 regimen elicits a comparable response to the standard 30 ug dose for each immune indicator, with viral neutralization nearly an order of magnitude greater than the tenable CoP estimate. Similarly, a single dose 10ug BNT 162b2 regimen or a two dose 1ug BNT 162b2 regimen equals or exceeds the immunogenicity of a single 30 ug dose.

ConclusionIf it is reasonable for the FDA, EMA, and Access Consortium to approve vaccine modifications without a clinical trial based on immunogenicity data, three alternate low dose regimens were identified that meet the requirements of having comparable immunogenicity relative to a protocol that has proven clinical efficacy. Immediate implementation of these lower dose regimens should be considered as they have major implications in alleviating vaccine supply, as well as improving vaccine side effect profile, and lowering total cost of vaccination.","Jurgens, G.",2021-03-11,Allergy And Immunology,10.1101/2021.03.06.21253058,2,Graham Jurgens,Unaffiliated,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.06.21253058v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.06.21253058v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,"NA"

The performance of Ag-RDT vary greatly between manufacturers and evaluating their analytical limit of detection (LOD) has become high priority. Here we describe a manufacturer-independent evaluation of the LOD of 19 marketed Ag-RDT using live SARS-CoV-2 spiked in different matrices: direct culture supernatant, a dry swab, and a swab in Amies. Additionally, the LOD using dry swab was investigated after 7 days storage at -80{degrees}C of the SARS-CoV-2 serial dilutions. An LOD of {approx} 5.0 x 102 pfu/ml (1.0 x 106 genome copies/ml) in culture media is defined as acceptable by the World Health Organization.

Six Ag-RDT were not compatible with Amies media and a decreased sensitivity of 2 to 20-fold was observed for eleven tests on the stored dilutions at -80{degrees}C for 7 days.

22721,Association between benzodiazepine receptor agonist use and increased mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19: results from an observational study,"ObjectiveTo examine the association between benzodiazepine receptor agonist (BZRA) use and mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

MethodsWe conducted an observational multicenter retrospective cohort study at AP-HP Greater Paris University hospitals. The sample involved 14,381 adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19. 686 (4.8%) inpatients received a BZRA within at the time of hospital admission at a mean daily diazepam-equivalent dose of 19.7 mg (SD=25.4). The study baseline was the date of hospital admission and the primary endpoint was death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received BZRAs and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusted for patient characteristics (such as age, sex, obesity and comorbidity) and other medications. The primary analysis was a Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting (IPW).

ResultsOver a mean follow-up of 14.5 days (SD=18.1), the primary endpoint occurred in 186 patients (27.1%) who received a BZRA and in 1,134 patients (8.3%) who did not. There was a significant association between BZRA use and increased mortality both in the crude analysis (HR=3.20; 95% CI=2.74-3.74; p<0.01) and in the primary IPW analysis (HR=1.61; 95% CI=1.31-1.98, p<0.01), with a significant dose-dependent relationship (HR=1.55; 95% CI=1.08-2.22; p=0.02). This association remained significant in multiple sensitivity analyses.

7903,Mortality of the COVID-19 outbreak in Sweden in relation to previous severe disease outbreaks,"Influenza viruses have caused disease outbreaks in human societies for a long time. Influenza often has rapid onset and relatively short duration, both in the individual and in the population. The case fatality rate varies for different strains of the virus, as do the effects on total mortality. Outbreaks related to coronavirus infections have recently become a global concern but much less is known about the dynamics of these outbreaks and their effects on mortality.

In this work, disease outbreaks in Sweden, in the time period of 1860-2020, are characterized and compared to the currently ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. The focus is on outbreaks with a sharp increase in all-cause mortality. Outbreak onset is defined as the time point when deaths counts starts to increase consistently for a period of 10 days. The duration of the outbreak is defined as the time period in which mortality rates are elevated. Excess mortality is estimated by standard methods.

In total there were 15 outbreaks detected in the time period, the first 14 were likely caused by influenza virus infections, the last by SARS-CoV-2. The mortality dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is shown to be similar to outbreaks due to influenza virus, and in terms of the number of excess deaths, it is the worst outbreak in Sweden since the Spanish flu of 1918-1919.","Ledberg, A.",2020-12-07,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.22.20110320,3,Anders Ledberg,Stockholm university,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.20110320v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.20110320v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.3389/fpubh.2021.579948
18068,A gender comparison of the psychological distress of medical students in Nigeria during the Coronavirus pandemic: A cross-sectional survey.,"BackgroundThe Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic as a large scale stressor could have negative distress on the mental health on medical students. Since gender differences in mental health may exist between males and females, it would prove interesting to see if a large scale stressor such as the pandemic will cause variances in the psychological distress between both genders.This study assessed and compared the psychological distress of COVID-19 among male and female medical students in medical schools in South-Western Nigeria

Materials and methodsA cross-sectional online survey using was carried out among 1010 medical students from three largest universities in south western Nigeria during the COVID-19 pandemic. The respondents were purposively selected, data was obtained on participants demographic and psychological distress was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ-12). Data was analyzed using the SPSS version 21 statistical software, chi square was used to assess gender differences, multivariate regression analysis assessed the predictors of psychological distress among both gendersand p values less than 0.05 were considered significant.

ResultsFemale medical students are at a higher risk of psychological distress compared to their male counterparts (p<0.005). Females were almost twice at risk of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic than males (OR=1.534, 95% p=0.003). Females with a positive history of mental illness were five times more at risk of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to females with no previous mental health history (OR=5.102, p=0.002)

ConclusionFemales were at higher risk of psychological distress compared to male students. Gender specific interventions addressing psychological distress among medical students are recommended.","Idowu, O. M.; Adaramola, O. G.; Aderounmu, B. S.; Olugbamigbe, I. D.; Dada, O.

3055,Estimation of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Prevalence in Santa Clara County,"To reliably estimate the demand on regional health systems and perform public health planning, it is necessary to have a good estimate of the prevalence of infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) in the population. In the absence of wide-spread testing, we provide one approach to infer prevalence based on the assumption that the fraction of true infections needing hospitalization is fixed and that all hospitalized cases of COVID-19 in Santa Clara are identified.

Our goal is to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, i.e. the true number of people currently infected with the virus, divided by the total population size.

Our analysis suggests that as of March 17, 2020, there are 6,500 infections (0.34% of the population) of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County. Based on adjusting the parameters of our model to be optimistic (respectively pessimistic), the number of infections would be 1,400 (resp. 26,000), corresponding to a prevalence of 0.08% (resp. 1.36%). If the shelter-in-place led to R0 < 1, we would expect the number of infections to remain about constant for the next few weeks. However, even if this were true, we expect to continue to see an increase in hospitalized cases of COVID-19 in the short term due to the fact that infection of SARS-CoV-2 on March 17th can lead to hospitalizations up to 14 days later.","Yadlowsky, S.; Shah, N.; Steinhardt, J.",2020-03-27,Health Policy,10.1101/2020.03.24.20043067,1,Steve Yadlowsky,Stanford University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20043067v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20043067v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,"NA"
22376,An alternative approach for bioanalytical assay development for wastewater-based epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2,"Wastewater-based epidemiology could be applied to track down SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks at high spatio-temporal resolution and could potentially be used as an early-warning for emergence of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the general population. Epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in monitoring the spread of the virus in the population and controlling possible outbreaks. However, sensitive sample preparation and detection methods are necessary to detect trace levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in influent wastewater (IWW).

Unlike predecessors, method development of a SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration and detection procedure was performed with IWW samples with high viral SARS-CoV-2 loads (in combination with seeding IWW with a surrogate coronavirus). This is of importance since the SARS-CoV-2 genome in IWW might have already been subject to in-sewer degradation into smaller genome fragments or might be present in a different form (e.g. cell debris,...). Centricon Plus-70 (100 kDa) centrifugal filter devices resulted in the lowest and most reproducible Ct-values for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Lowering pore sizes did not improve our limit of detection and quantification. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was employed for the amplification of the N1, N2, N3 and E_Sarbeco-gene.

This is one of the first studies to apply digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in IWW. Interestingly, qPCR results were comparable with dPCR results suggesting that qPCR is a valid method. In this study, dPCR was also used as a proxy to assess the precision of qPCR. In this light, dPCR showed high variability at low concentration levels (100 copies/{micro}L), indicating that variability in bioanalytical assays for SARS-CoV-2 RNA might be substantial.

On average, the N2-gene showed high in-sample stability in IWW for 10 days of storage at 4 {degrees}C. Between-sample variability was substantial due to the low native concentrations in IWW. Additionally, the E-gene proved to be less stable compared to the N2-gene and showed higher variability. Freezing the IWW samples resulted in a 10-fold decay of loads of the N2- and E-gene in IWW.

Although WBE can already aid in filling some knowledge gaps in the epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, future WBE studies should aim to further validate and standardize bioanalytical assays, especially with regards to methodological limitations.

9772,Comparison of Mental Health Symptoms Prior to and During COVID-19 among Patients with Systemic Sclerosis from Four Countries: A Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network (SPIN) Cohort Study,"BackgroundNo studies have reported comparisons of mental health symptoms prior to and during COVID-19 in vulnerable populations. Objectives were to compare anxiety and depression symptoms among people with a pre-existing medical condition, the autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma), including continuous change scores, proportion with change [&ge;] 1 minimal clinically important difference (MCID), and factors associated with changes, including country.

MethodsPre-COVID-19 Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network Cohort data were linked to COVID-19 data collected April 9 to April 27, 2020. Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 scale (MCID = 4 points) and depression symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (MCID = 3 points). Multiple linear and logistic regression were used to assess factors associated with continuous change and change[&ge;] 1 MCID.

FindingsAmong 435 participants (Canada = 98; France = 159; United Kingdom = 50; United States = 128), mean anxiety symptoms increased 4.9 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.0 to 5.7). Depression symptom change was negligible (0.3 points; 95% CI -0.7 to 0.2). Compared to France, adjusted scores from the United States and United Kingdom were 3.8 points (95% CI 1.7 to 5.9) and 2.9 points higher (95% CI 0.0 to 5.7); scores for Canada were not significantly different. Odds of increasing by [&ge;] 1 MCID were twice as high for the United Kingdom (2.0, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.2) and United States (1.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.2). Participants who used mental health services pre-COVID had adjusted increases 3.7 points (95% CI 1.7 to 5.7) less than other participants.

InterpretationAnxiety symptoms, but not depression symptoms, increased dramatically during COVID-19 among people with a pre-existing medical condition. Increase was larger in the United Kingdom and United States than in Canada and France but substantially less for people with pre-COVID-19 mental health treatment.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe referred to a living systematic review that is evaluating mental health changes from pre-COVID-19 to COVID-19 by searching 7 databases, including 2 Chinese language databases, plus preprint servers, with daily updates (https://www.depressd.ca/covid-19-mental-health). As of June 13, 2020, only 5 studies had compared mental health symptoms prior to and during COVID-19. In 4 studies of university students, there were small increases in depression or general mental health symptoms but minimal or no increases in anxiety symptoms. A general population study from the United Kingdom reported a small increase in general mental health symptoms but did not differentiate between types of symptoms. No studies have reported changes from pre-COVID-19 among people vulnerable due to pre-existing medical conditions. No studies have compared mental health changes between countries, despite major differences in pandemic responses.

Added value of this studyWe evaluated changes in anxiety and depression symptoms among 435 participants with the autoimmune condition systemic sclerosis and compared results from Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare mental health symptoms prior to and during COVID-19 in any vulnerable population. These are the first data to document the substantial degree to which anxiety symptoms have increased and the minimal changes in depression symptoms among vulnerable individuals. It is also the first study to examine the association of symptom changes with country of residence and to identify that people receiving pre-COVID-19 mental health services may be more resilient and experience less substantial symptom increases than others.

Implications of all the available evidenceAlthough this was an observational study, it provided evidence that vulnerable people with a pre-existing medical condition have experienced substantially increased anxiety symptoms and that these increases appear to be associated with where people live and, possibly, different experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic across countries. By comparing with evidence from university samples, which found that depression symptoms were more prominent, these data underline the need for accessible interventions tailored to specific needs of different populations. They also suggest that mental health treatments may help people to develop skills or create resilience, which may reduce vulnerability to major stressors such as COVID-19.","Thombs, B.

19710,"Azithromycin in Hospitalised Patients with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial","BackgroundAzithromycin has been proposed as a treatment for COVID-19 on the basis of its immunomodulatory actions. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of azithromycin in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.

MethodsIn this randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial, several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to either usual standard of care alone or usual standard of care plus azithromycin 500 mg once daily by mouth or intravenously for 10 days or until discharge (or one of the other treatment arms). Patients were twice as likely to be randomised to usual care as to any of the active treatment groups. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. The trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).

FindingsBetween 7 April and 27 November 2020, 2582 patients were randomly allocated to receive azithromycin and 5182 patients to receive usual care alone. Overall, 496 (19%) patients allocated to azithromycin and 997 (19%) patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 1{middle dot}00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0{middle dot}90-1{middle dot}12; p=0{middle dot}99). Consistent results were seen in all pre-specified subgroups of patients. There was no difference in duration of hospitalisation (median 12 days vs. 13 days) or the proportion of patients discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (60% vs. 59%; rate ratio 1{middle dot}03; 95% CI 0{middle dot}97-1{middle dot}10; p=0{middle dot}29). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, there was no difference in the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (21% vs. 22%; risk ratio 0{middle dot}97; 95% CI 0{middle dot}89-1{middle dot}07; p=0{middle dot}54).

InterpretationIn patients hospitalised with COVID-19, azithromycin did not provide any clinical benefit. Azithromycin use in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 should be restricted to patients where there is a clear antimicrobial indication.

A detailed scientific analysis of this phenomenon is still to come, but now it is urgently needed to evaluate the parameters of the disease dynamics in order to make some preliminary estimations of the number of cases and possible duration of the pandemic. The corresponding mathematical models must be simple enough, since their parameters are unknown and have to be estimated using limited statistical data sets. The SIR model, statistical approach to the parameter identification and the official WHO daily data about the confirmed cumulative number of cases were used to calculate the SIR curves and make some estimations and predictions. New cases in Italy could stop to appear after May 12, 2020, and the final number of such accumulated cases could be around 112 thousand.

3294,First month of the epidemic caused by COVID-19 in Italy: current status and real-time outbreak development forecast,"BackgroundThe first outbreaks of COVID-19 in Italy occurred during the second half of February 2020 in some areas in the North of the country. Due to the high contagiousness of the infection, further spread by asymptomatic people, Italy has become in a few weeks the country with the greatest number of infected people after China. The large number of severe cases among infected people in Italy led to the hospitalization of thousands of patients, with a heavy burden on the National Health Service.

MethodsWe analyzed data provided daily by Italian Authorities for the period from 24 February 2020 to 26 March 2020. Considering such information, we developed a forecast model in real-time, based on the cumulative logistic distribution. We then produced an estimate of the overall number of potentially infected individuals and epidemic duration at a national and Regional level, for the most affected Regions.

ResultsWe reported the daily distribution of performed swabs and confirmed cases, and the cumulative distribution of confirmed cases, of patients quarantined at home (42%), hospitalized in non-intensive care (31%), recovered or discharged (13%), deceased (10%), and hospitalized in intensive care (4%). The forecast model estimated a number of infected persons for Italy of 115,000 about, and a duration of the epidemic not less than 2 months.

ConclusionsOnce month after the first outbreaks there seems to be the first signs of a decrease in the number of infections, showing that we could be now facing the descending phase of the epidemic. The forecast obtained thanks to our model could be used by decision-makers to implement coordinative and collaborative efforts in order to control the epidemic.","Megna, R.",2020-03-30,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.26.20044628,1,Rosario Megna,National Council of Research,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044628v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044628v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1186/s41256-020-00170-3
22708,Reported COVID-19 Incidence in Wisconsin High School Athletes During Fall 2020,"IntroductionThe purpose of this study was to describe the reported incidence of COVID-19 in Wisconsin high school athletes in September 2020, and to investigate the relationship of COVID-19 incidence with sport and face mask use.

MethodsSurveys were sent to athletic directors of all Wisconsin high schools regarding sports during September 2020. The association between reported case rates in athletes in each county and the county general population were evaluated with a weighted linear model. Multivariable negative binomial regression models evaluated the associations between COVID-19 incidence and sport type and face mask use by players, adjusting for the county COVID-19 incidence for each school.

Results207 schools that had reinitiated sport reported 270 COVID-19 cases among 30,074 players, for case and incidence rates of 809 cases per 100,000 players and 32.6 cases per 100,000 player-days, respectively. The case rates for athletes in each county were positively correlated with the case rates for the countys general population ({beta} =1.14{+/-}0.20, r=0.60, p<0.001). One hundred fifteen (55%) of cases were attributed to household contact, 85 (41%) to contact outside sport or school, 5 (2.4%) to school contact, and 1 (0.5%) to sport contact. No difference was identified between team and individual sports (incidence rate ratio (IRR)=1.03 [95% CI=0.49-2.2], p=0.93) or between non-contact and contact sports (IRR=0.53 [0.23-1.3], p=0.14), although the difference between outdoor and indoor sports approached statistical significance (IRR=0.52 [0.26-1.1], p=0.07). 84% of schools required face masks while playing. For those sports with >50 participating schools, there were no significant associations between COVID-19 incidence and face mask use in cross country (IRR=0.71 [0.2-2.2], p=0.52), football (IRR=1.6 [0.6-5.1], p=0.404), boys soccer (IRR=2.3 [0.5-17], p=0.31), or girls volleyball (IRR=1.4 [0.3-6.6], p=0.64).

ConclusionsIncidence of reported COVID-19 among athletes was related to background county incidence and most cases were attributed to household and community contact. Although not statistically significant, reported COVID-19 incidence may be lower in outdoor sports. Face mask use did not have a significant benefit, which may be due to relatively low rates of COVID-19 and the small number of schools that did not report using face masks.","Sasser, P.; Mcguine, T.; Haraldsdottir, K.; Biese, K.; Goodavish, L.; Stevens, B.; Watson, A.",2021-02-20,Sports Medicine,10.1101/2021.02.18.21251986,1,Andrew Watson,"University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.18.21251986v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.18.21251986v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.4085/1062-6050-0185.21
12147,Epidemiological and cohort study finds no association between COVID-19 and Guillain-Barre syndrome,"BackgroundReports of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) have emerged during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This epidemiological and cohort study sought to investigate any causative association between COVID-19 infection and GBS.

MethodsThe epidemiology of GBS cases reported via the UK National Immunoglobulin Database were studied from 2016-2019 and compared to cases reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. For the cohort study, members of the British Peripheral Nerve Society reported all cases of GBS during the pandemic. The clinical features, investigation findings and outcomes of COVID-19 (definite or probable) and non-COVID-19 associated GBS cases were compared.

ResultsThe UK GBS incidence from 2016-2019 was 1.65-1.88 per 100,000 people per year. GBS and COVID-19 incidence varied between regions and did not correlate (r = 0.06, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.63, p=0.86). GBS incidence fell between March and May 2020 compared to the same months of 2016-2019. Forty-seven GBS cases were included in the cohort study (13 definite, 12 probable COVID-19 and 22 non-COVID-19). There were no significant differences in the pattern of weakness, time to nadir, neurophysiology, CSF findings or outcome. Intubation was more frequent in the COVID-19+ve cohort (7/13, 54% vs 5/22, 23% in COVID negative) thought to be related directly to COVID-19 pulmonary involvement.

ConclusionsThis study finds no epidemiological or phenotypic clues of SARS-CoV-2 being causative of GBS. GBS incidence has fallen during the pandemic which may be the influence of lockdown measures reducing transmission of GBS inducing pathogens such as Campylobacter jejuni and respiratory viruses.","Keddie, S.; Pakpoor, J.; Mousele, C.; Pipis, M.; Machado, P.

ResultsOf 9,896 eligible invited adults, 5,412 (54.7%) completed surveys; 5,011 (92.6%) respondents met screening criteria and were analysed, including 1,362 (27.2%) caregivers. Caregivers had higher prevalences of adverse mental health symptoms than non-caregivers, including anxiety or depressive disorder symptoms (57.6% vs 21.5%, respectively, p<0.0001) having recently seriously considered suicide (33.4% vs 3.7%, p<0.0001). Symptoms were more common among caregivers who were young vs older adults (e.g., aged 18-24 vs [&ge;]65 years, aPR 2.75, 95% CI 1.95-3.88, p<0.0001), Hispanic or Latino vs non-Hispanic White (1.14, 1.04-1.25, p=0.0044), living with vs without disabilities (1.18, 1.10-1.26, p<0.0001), and with moderate and high vs low Caregiver Intensity Index scores (2.31, 1.65-3.23; 2.81, 2.00-3.94; both p<0.0001). Suicidal ideation was more prevalent among non-Hispanic Black vs non-Hispanic White caregivers (1.48, 1.15-1.90, p=0.0022).

ConclusionsCaregivers, who accounted for one in four US adult respondents in this nationally representative sample, more commonly reported adverse mental health symptoms than non-caregivers. Increased visibility of and access to mental health care resources are urgently needed to address mental health challenges of caregiving.","Czeisler, M. E.; Drane, A.; Winnay, S. S.; Capodilupo, E.

24916,Monitoring carbon dioxide to quantify the risk of indoor airborne transmission of COVID-19,"A new guideline for mitigating indoor airborne transmission of COVID-19 prescribes a limit on the time spent in a shared space with an infected individual (Bazant and Bush, 2021). Here, we rephrase this safety guideline in terms of occupancy time and mean exhaled carbon dioxide concentration in an indoor space, thereby enabling the use of CO2 monitors in the risk assessment of airborne transmission of respiratory diseases. While CO2 concentration is related to airborne pathogen concentration (Rudnick and Milton, 2003), the guideline developed here accounts for the different physical processes affecting their evolution, such as enhanced pathogen production from vocal activity and pathogen removal via face-mask use, filtration, sedimentation and deactivation. Critically, transmission risk depends on the total infectious dose, so necessarily depends on both the pathogen concentration and exposure time. The transmission risk is also modulated by the fractions of susceptible, infected and immune persons within a population, which evolve as the pandemic runs its course. A mathematical model is developed that enables a prediction of airborne transmission risk from real-time CO2 measurements. Illustrative examples of implementing our guideline are presented using data from CO2 monitoring in university classrooms and office spaces.

O_TEXTBOXImpact StatementThere is mounting scientific evidence that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through indoor airborne transmission, as arises when a susceptible person inhales virus-laden aerosol droplets exhaled by an infectious person. A safety guideline to limit indoor airborne transmission (Bazant and Bush, 2021) has recently been derived that complements the public health guidelines on surface cleaning and social distancing. We here recast this safety guideline in terms of total inhaled carbon dioxide, as can be readily monitored in most indoor spaces. Our approach paves the way for optimizing air handling systems by balancing health and financial concerns, informs policy for safely re-opening schools and businesses as the pandemic runs its course, and may be applied quite generally in the mitigation of airborne respiratory illnesses, including influenza.

15142,Sensing of COVID-19 Antibodies in Seconds via Aerosol Jet Printed Three Dimensional Electrodes,"Rapid diagnosis is critical for the treatment and prevention of diseases. In this research, we report sensing of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 virus in seconds via an electrochemical platform consisting of gold micropillar array electrodes decorated with reduced graphene oxide and functionalized with recombinant viral antigens. The array electrodes are fabricated by Aerosol Jet (AJ) nanoparticle 3D printing, where gold nanoparticles (3-5nm) are assembled in 3D space, sintered, and integrated with a microfluidic device. The device is shown to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein and its receptor-binding-domain (RBD) at concentrations down to 1pM via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and read by a smartphone-based user interface. In addition, the sensor can be regenerated within a minute by introducing a low-pH chemistry that elutes the antibodies from the antigens, allowing successive testing of multiple antibody samples using the same sensor. The detection time for the two antibodies tested in this work is 11.5 seconds. S1 protein sensing of its antibodies is specific, which cross-reacts neither with other antibodies nor with proteins such as Nucleocapsid antibody and Interleukin-6 protein. The proposed sensing platform is generic and can also be used for the rapid detection of biomarkers for other infectious agents such as Ebola, HIV, and Zika, which will benefit the public health.","Ali, M.

9476,Early administration of lopinavir/ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine does not alter the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a retrospective cohort study.,"As it has been shown that lopinavir (LPV) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have in vitro activity against coronaviruses, they were used to treat COVID-19 during the first wave of the epidemic in Lombardy, Italy.

The aim of this retrospective intent-to-treat analysis of the hospitalized patients who started off-label treatment with LPV/ritonavir (LPV/r)+HCQ between 21 February and 20 March 2020 was to compare the rate of clinical improvement between those who started the treatment within five days of symptom onset (early treatment, ET) and those who started later (delayed treatment, DT). The association between the timing of treatment and the probability of 30-day mortality was also assessed using uni- and multivariable logistic models.

The study involved 172 patients: 43 (25%) in the ET and 129 (75%) in the DT group. The rate of clinical improvement increased over time to 73.3% on day 30, without any significant difference between the two groups (Grays test P = 0.213). After adjusting for potentially relevant clinical variables, there was no significant association between the timing of the start of treatment and the probability of 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] ET vs DT = 1.45, 95% confidence interval 0.50-4.19). Eight percent of the patients discontinued the treatment because of severe gastrointestinal disorders attributable to LPV/r.

The timing of the start of LPV/r+HCQ treatment does not seem to affect the clinical course of hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Together with the severe adverse events attributable to LPV/r, this raises concerns about the benefit of using this combination to treat COVID-19.","Giacomelli, A.; Pagani, G.; Ridolfo, A.

21687,Duration of SARS-CoV-2 Sero-Positivity in a Large Longitudinal Sero-Surveillance Cohort: The COVID-19 Community Research Partnership,"BackgroundEstimating population prevalence and incidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential to formulate public health recommendations concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. However, interpreting estimates based on sero-surveillance requires an understanding of the duration of elevated antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the large number of people with pauci-symptomatic or asymptomatic disease.

MethodsWe examined >30,000 serology assays for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM assays acquired longitudinally in 11,468 adults between April and November 2020 in the COVID-19 Community Research Partnership.

FindingsAmong participants with serologic evidence for infection but few or no symptoms or clinical disease, roughly 50% sero-reverted in 30 days of their initial positive test. Sero-reversion occurred more quickly for IgM than IgG and for antibodies targeting nucleocapsid protein compared with spike proteins, but was not associated with age, sex, race/ethnicity, or healthcare worker status.

InterpretationThe short duration of antibody response suggests that the true population prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection may be significantly higher than presumed based on earlier sero-surveillance studies. The impact of the large number of minimally symptomatic COVID-19 cases with only a brief antibody response on population immunity remains to be determined.

O_TEXTBOXResearch in context

Evidence before this studyPrevious longitudinal studies of the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 suggest that people with less severe disease have a more rapid decline of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies than people with severe disease. However, these data come from small laboratory-based investigations or studies of convenience samples identified based on symptomatic disease.

Added value of this studyThis study provides extensive longitudinal serologic follow-up in a large number of people with serologic evidence of prior infection who had little or no symptoms based on active daily symptom surveillance.

Implications of the available evidenceThe data indicate that serologic evidence of prior infection in minimally symptomatic people is fleeting, suggesting that cross-sectional sero-surveys have under-estimated the true prevalence of prior infection in populations. The data highlight the challenge of determining transmission dynamics and long-term immunity in asymptomatic cases which likely represents an even larger fraction of all cases of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection than previously presumed.

4810,Differential ventilation using flow control valves as a potential bridge to full ventilatory support during the COVID-19 crisis,"BackgroundIt has been projected that there will be too few ventilators to meet demand during the COVID-19 (SARS CoV-2) pandemic. Ventilator sharing has been suggested as a crisis standard of care strategy to increase availability of mechanical ventilation. The safety and practicality of shared ventilation in patients is unknown. We designed and evaluated a system whereby one mechanical ventilator can be used to simultaneously ventilate two patients who have different lung compliances using a custom manufactured flow control valve to allow for individual adjustment of tidal volume and airway pressure for each patient.

MethodsThe system was first evaluated in a simulation lab using two human patient simulators under expected clinical conditions. It was then tested in an observational study of four patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Two separately ventilated COVID-19 patients were connected to a single ventilator for one hour. This intervention was repeated in a second pair of patients. Ventilatory parameters (tidal volume, peak airway pressures, compliance) were recorded at five minute intervals during both studys. Arterial blood gases were taken at zero, thirty, and sixty minutes. The primary outcome was maintenance of stable acid-base status and oxygenation during shared ventilation.

ResultsTwo male and two female patients, age range 32-56 yrs, participated. Ideal body weight and driving pressure were markedly different among patients. All patients demonstrated stable physiology and ventilation for the duration of shared ventilation. In one patient tidal volume was increased after 30 minutes to correct a respiratory acidosis.

ConclusionsDifferential ventilation using a single ventilator and a split breathing circuit with flow control valves is possible. A single ventilator could feasibly be used to safely ventilate two COVID-19 patients simultaneously as a bridge to full ventilatory support.

13167,"Immunogenicity and Safety of a SARS-CoV-2 Inactivated Vaccine in Healthy Adults Aged 18-59 years: Report of the Randomized, Double-blind, and Placebo-controlled Phase 2 Clinical Trial","BACKGROUNDThe top priority for the control of COVID-19 pandemic currently is the development of a vaccine. A phase 2 trial conducted to further evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine (CoronaVac).

METHODSWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the optimal dose, immunogenicity and safety of the CoronaVac. A total of 600 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were randomly assigned to receive 2 injections of the trial vaccine at a dose of 3 g/0.5 mL or 6 g /0.5mL, or placebo on Day 0,14 schedule or Day 0,28 schedule. For safety evaluation, solicited and unsolicited adverse events were collected after each vaccination within 7 days and 28 days, respectively. Blood samples were taken for antibody assay.

RESULTSCoronaVac was well tolerated, and no dose-related safety concerns were observed. Most of the adverse reactions fell in the solicited category and were mild in severity. Pain at injection site was the most frequently reported symptoms. No Grade 3 adverse reaction or vaccine related SAEs were reported. CoronaVac showed good immunogenicity with the lower 3 g dose eliciting 92.4% seroconversion under Day 0,14 schedule and 97.4% under Day 0,28 schedule. 28 days after two-dose vaccination, the Nab levels of individual schedules range from 23.8 to 65.4 among different dosage and vaccination schedules.

CONCLUSIONSFavorable safety and immunogenicity of CoronaVac was demonstrated on both schedules and both dosages, which support the conduction of phase 3 trial with optimum schedule/dosage per different scenarios.","Zhang, Y.-J.; Zeng, G.; Pan, H.-X.; Li, C.-G.; Kan, B.; Hu, Y.-L.; Mao, H.-Y.; Xin, Q.-Q.; Chu, K.; Han, W.-X.; Chen, Z.; Tang, R.; Yin, W.-D.; Chen, X.; Gong, X.-J.; Qin, C.; Hu, Y.-S.; Liu, X.-Y.; Cui, G.-L.; Jiang, C.-B.; Zhang, H.-M.; Li, J.-X.; Yang, M.-N.; Lian, X.-J.; Song, Y.; Lu, J.-X.; Wang, X.-X.; Xu, M.; Gao, Q.; Zhu, F.-C.",2020-08-10,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.07.31.20161216,1,Feng-Cai Zhu,Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.31.20161216v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.31.20161216v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
24396,Epitweetr: Early warning of public health threats using Twitter data,"BackgroundECDC performs epidemic intelligence activities to systematically collate information from a variety of sources, including Twitter, to rapidly detect public health events. The lack of a freely available, customisable and automated early warning tool using Twitter data, prompted ECDC to develop epitweetr.

The specific objectives are to assess the performance of the geolocation and signal detection algorithms used by epitweetr and to assess the performance of epitweetr in comparison with the manual monitoring of Twitter for early detection of public health threats.

MethodsEpitweetr collects, geolocates and aggregates tweets to generate signals and email alerts. Firstly, we evaluated manually the tweet geolocation characteristics of 1,200 tweets, and assessed its accuracy in extracting the correct location and its performance in detecting tweets with available information on the tweet geolocation. Secondly, we evaluated signals generated by epitweetr between 19 October and 30 November 2020 and we calculated the positive predictive value (PPV). Then, we evaluated the sensitivity, specificity and timeliness of epitweetr in comparison with Twitter manual monitoring.

FindingsThe epitweetr geolocation algorithm had an accuracy of 30.1% and 25.9% at national and subnational levels, respectively. General and specific PPV of the signal detection algorithm was 3.0% and 74.6%, respectively. Epitweetr and/or manual monitoring detected 570 signals and 454 events. Epitweetr had a sensitivity of 78.6% [75.2% - 82.0%] and PPV of 74.6% [70.5% - 78.6%]; and the manual monitoring had a sensitivity of 47.9% [43.8% - 52.0%] and PPV of 97.9% [95.8% - 99.9%]. The median validation time difference between sixteen common events detected by epitweetr and manual monitoring was -48.6 hours [(-102.8) - (-23.7) hours].

InterpretationEpitweetr has shown to have sufficient performance as an early warning tool for public health threats using Twitter data. Having developed epitweetr as a free, open-source tool with several configurable settings and a strong automated component, it is expected to increase its usability and usefulness to public health experts.

Most recent studies, in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, have shown the added value of early warning tools based on Twitter and other social media platforms. They also noted the lack of an open-source tool for real-time monitoring and surveillance.

Added value of this studyEpitweetr is a free, open-source and R-based early warning tool for automatic Twitter data monitoring that will support public health experts in rapidly detecting public health threats. The evaluation of epitweetr presented in this study shows the strengths of the tool which include having good performance, high degree of automation, being a near-real-time tool and being publicly available with various customisable settings. Furthermore, it shows which are the areas of improvement for the next versions of epitweetr.

15251,"Association among income loss, financial strain and depressive symptoms during COVID-19: evidence from two longitudinal studies","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has major ramifications for global health and the economy, with growing concerns about economic recession and implications for mental health. Here we investigated the associations between COVID-19 pandemic-related income loss with financial strain and mental health trajectories over a 1-month course.

MethodsTwo independent studies were conducted in the U.S and in Israel at the beginning of the outbreak (March-April 2020, T1; N = 4 171) and at a 1-month follow-up (T2; N = 1 559). Mixed-effects models were applied to assess associations among COVID-19-related income loss, financial strain, and pandemic-related worries about health, with anxiety and depression, controlling for multiple covariates including pre-COVID-19 income.

FindingsIn both studies, income loss and financial strain were associated with greater depressive symptoms at T1, above and beyond T1 anxiety, worries about health, and pre-COVID-19 income. Worsening of income loss was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in both studies. Worsening of subjective financial strain was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in one study (US).

InterpretationIncome loss and financial strain were uniquely associated with depressive symptoms and the exacerbation of symptoms over time, above and beyond pandemic-related anxiety. Considering the painful dilemma of lockdown versus reopening, with the tradeoff between public health and economic wellbeing, our findings provide evidence that the economic impact of COVID-19 has negative implications for mental health.

13208,Comparative Clinical Outcomes and Mortality in Prisoner and Non-Prisoner Populations Hospitalized with COVID-19: A Cohort from Michigan,"BackgroundPrisons in the United States have become a hotbed for spreading Covid-19 among incarcerated individuals. Covid-19 cases among prisoners are on the rise, with more than 46,000 confirmed cases to date. However, there is paucity of data addressing clinical outcomes and mortality in prisoners hospitalized with Covid-19.

MethodsAn observational study of all patients hospitalized with Covid-19 between March 10 and May 10, 2020 at two Henry Ford Health System hospitals in Michigan. Clinical outcomes were compared amongst hospitalized prisoners and non-prisoner patients. The primary outcomes were intubation rates, in-hospital mortality, and 30-day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox-regression models were used to investigate primary outcomes.

ResultsOf the 706 hospitalized Covid-19 patients (mean age 66.7 {+/-} 16.1 years, 57% males, and 44% black), 108 were prisoners and 598 were non-prisoners. Compared to non-prisoners, prisoners were more likely to present with fever, tachypnea, hypoxemia, and markedly elevated inflammatory markers. Prisoners were more commonly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (26.9% vs. 18.7%), required vasopressors (24.1% vs. 9.9%), and intubated (25.0% vs. 15.2%). Prisoners had higher unadjusted inpatient mortality (29.6% vs. 20.1%) and 30-day mortality (34.3% vs. 24.6%). In the adjusted models, prisoner status was associated with higher in-hospital death (odds ratio, 1.95; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07 to 3.57) and 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.98).

22716,Preservation of neutralizing antibody function in COVID-19 convalescent plasma treated using a riboflavin and ultraviolet light-based pathogen reduction technology,"Background and ObjectiveConvalescent plasma (CP) has been embraced as a safe therapeutic option for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) while other treatments are developed. However, transfusion-transmitted disease is a risk, particularly in regions with high endemic prevalence of transfusion-transmissible diseases. Pathogen reduction can mitigate this risk; thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of riboflavin and ultraviolet light (R+UV) pathogen reduction technology on the functional properties of CCP.

Materials and MethodsCCP units (n = 6) from recovered COVID-19 research donors were treated with R+UV. Pre- and post-treatment samples were tested for coagulation factor and immunoglobulin retention. Antibody binding to spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), S1, and S2 epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by ELISA.

Neutralizing antibody (nAb) function was assessed by pseudovirus reporter viral particle neutralization (RVPN) assay and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT).

ResultsMean retention of coagulation factors was [&ge;] 70% while retention of immunoglobulins was 100%. Starting nAb titers were low, but PRNT50 titers did not differ between pre- and post-treatment samples.

6165,Trends in excess cancer and cardiovascular deaths in Scotland during the COVID-19 pandemic 30 December 2019 to 20 April 2020,"Understanding the trends in causes of death for different diseases during the current COVID-19 pandemic is important to determine whether there are excess deaths beyond what is normally expected. Using the most recent report from National Records Scotland (NRS) on 29 April 2020, we examined the percentage difference in crude numbers of deaths in 2020 compared to the average for 2015-2019 by week of death within calendar year. To determine if trends were similar, suggesting underreporting/underdiagnosed COVID-19 related deaths, we also looked at the trends in % differences for cardiovascular disease deaths. From the first 17 weeks of data, we found a peak in excess deaths at week 14 of 2020, about four weeks after the first case in Scotland was detected on 1 March 2020-- but by week 17 these excesses had returned to normal levels, 4 weeks after lockdown in the UK began. Similar observations were seen for cardiovascular disease-related deaths. These observations suggest that the short-term increase in excess cancer and cardiovascular deaths might be associated with undetected/unconfirmed deaths related to COVID-19. Both of these conditions make patients more susceptible to infection and lack of widespread access to testing for COVID-19 are likely to have resulted in under-estimation of COVID-19 mortality. These data further suggest that the cumulative toll of COVID-19 on mortality is likely undercounted. More detailed analysis is needed to determine if these excesses were directly or indirectly related to COVID-19. Disease specific mortality will need constant monitoring for the foreseeable future as changes occur in increasing capacity and access to testing, reporting criteria, changes to health services and different measures are implemented to control the spread of the COVID-19. Multidisciplinary, multi-institutional, national and international collaborations for complementary and population specific data analysis is required to respond and mitigate adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and to inform planning for future pandemics.","Figueroa, J.; Brennan, P.; Theodoratou, E.; Poon, M.; Purshouse, K.; Din, F.; Jin, K.; Mesa-Eguiagaray, I.; Dunlop, M.

23523,Inflammatory but not respiratory symptoms associated with ongoing upper airway viral replication in outpatients with uncomplicated COVID-19,"BackgroundThe vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections are uncomplicated and do not require hospitalization, but contribute to ongoing transmission. Our understanding of the clinical course of uncomplicated COVID-19 remains limited.

MethodsWe detailed the natural history of uncomplicated COVID-19 among 120 outpatients enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of Peginterferon Lambda. We characterized symptom trajectory and clusters using exploratory factor analysis, assessed predictors of symptom resolution and cessation of oropharyngeal viral shedding using Cox proportional hazard models, and evaluated associations between symptoms and viral shedding using mixed effects linear models.

ResultsHeadache, myalgias and chills peaked at day 4 after symptom onset; cough peaked on day 9. Two distinct symptom cluster trajectories were identified; one with mild, upper respiratory symptoms, and the other with more severe and prolonged inflammatory symptoms. The median time to symptom resolution from earliest symptom onset was 17 days (95% CI 14-18). Neither enrollment SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels (Hazard ratio [HR] 1.88, 95% CI 0.84-4.20) nor oropharyngeal viral load at enrollment (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98-1.05) were significantly associated with the time to symptom resolution. The median time to cessation of viral shedding was 10 days (95% CI 8-12), with higher SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels at enrollment associated with hastened resolution of viral shedding (HR 3.12, 95% CI 1.4-6.9, p=0.005). Myalgia, joint pains, and chills were associated with a significantly greater odds of oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection.

ConclusionsIn this outpatient cohort, inflammatory symptoms peaked early and were associated with ongoing SARS-CoV-2 replication. SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were associated with more rapid viral shedding cessation, but not with time to symptom resolution. These findings have important implications for COVID-19 screening approaches and clinical trial design.","Jacobson, K. B.; Purington, N.; Parsonnet, J.; Andrews, J.

13726,On COVID-19-safety ranking of seats in intercontinental commercial aircrafts: A preliminary multiphysics computational perspective,"The evolution of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) into a pandemic has severely hampered the usage of public transit systems. In a post-COVID-19 world, we may see an increased reliance on autonomous cars and personal rapid transit (PRT) systems, with inherent physical distancing, over buses, trains and aircraft for intracity, intercity, and interstate travel. However, air travel would continue to be the dominant mode of intercontinental transportation for humans. In this study, we perform a comprehensive computational analysis of typical intercontinental aircraft ventilation systems to determine the seat where environmental factors are most conducive to human comfort with regards to air quality, protection from orally or nasally released pollutants such as CO2 and coronavirus, and thermal comfort levels. Air velocity, temperature, and air pollutant concentration emitted from the nose/mouth of fellow travelers are considered for both Boeing and Airbus planes. In each plane, first class, business class, and economy class sections were analyzed. We present conclusions as to which is the optimum seat in each section of each plane and provide the data of the environmental conditions to support our inferences. The findings may be used by the general public to decide which seat to occupy for their next intercontinental flight. Alternatively, the commercial airliners can use such a model to plan the occupancy of the aircraft on long-duration intercontinental flights (viz., Airbus A380 and Boeing B747).","Desai, P.

27540,"Aspirin in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial","BackgroundAspirin has been proposed as a treatment for COVID-19 on the basis of its antithrombotic properties.

MethodsIn this randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial, several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Eligible and consenting adults were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either usual standard of care plus 150mg aspirin once daily until discharge or usual standard of care alone using web-based simple (unstratified) randomisation with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. The trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).

FindingsBetween 01 November 2020 and 21 March 2021, 7351 patients were randomly allocated to receive aspirin and 7541 patients to receive usual care alone. Overall, 1222 (17%) patients allocated to aspirin and 1299 (17%) patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0{middle dot}96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0{middle dot}89-1{middle dot}04; p=0{middle dot}35). Consistent results were seen in all pre-specified subgroups of patients. Patients allocated to aspirin had a slightly shorter duration of hospitalisation (median 8 vs. 9 days) and a higher proportion were discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (75% vs. 74%; rate ratio 1{middle dot}06; 95% CI 1{middle dot}02-1{middle dot}10; p=0{middle dot}0062). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, there was no significant difference in the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (21% vs. 22%; risk ratio 0{middle dot}96; 95% CI 0{middle dot}90-1{middle dot}03; p=0{middle dot}23). Aspirin use was associated with an absolute reduction in thrombotic events of 0.6% (SE 0.4%) and an absolute increase in major bleeding events of 0.6% (SE 0.2%).

InterpretationIn patients hospitalised with COVID-19, aspirin was not associated with reductions in 28-day mortality or in the risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death but was associated with a small increase in the rate of being discharged alive within 28 days.

All countries have implemented multiple strategies to try mitigating the losses caused by this virus. To stop the rapid spread of the disease and in compliance with the World Health Organizations social distancing policy, the government of Bangladesh has implemented a number of strategies, one of which is to limit the spread of the virus in hospitals by postponing elective procedures and providing only emergency services in the hospitals.

The objective of this survey was to assess the current status of pediatric surgical procedures in different hospitals in Bangladesh and assess the effects of the current restrictions along with their implications in the long run.

Materials and MethodsA survey was performed among doctors from public and private hospitals in Bangladesh to evaluate the status on pediatric surgery.

ResultsThe results clearly revealed the lack of a significant reduction in doctors exposure to SARS-CoV-2 by postponing elective procedures.

ConclusionKeeping in mind the socioeconomic and health care conditions of the country, the author recommend resuming elective surgical procedures.","Hannan, M. J.; Parveen, M. K.; Hasan, M.

13520,A novel approach for evaluating contact patterns and risk mitigation strategies for COVID-19 in English Primary Schools with application of Structured Expert Judgement,"BackgroundContact patterns are the drivers of close-contacts infections, such as COVID-19. In an effort to control COVID-19 transmission in the UK, schools were closed on 23 March 2020. With social distancing in place, Primary Schools were partially re-opened on 1 June 2020, with plans to fully re-open in September 2020. The impact of social distancing and risk mitigation measures on childrens contact patterns is not known.

MethodsWe conducted a structured expert elicitation of a sample of Primary Headteachers to quantify contact patterns within schools in pre-COVID-19 times and how these patterns were expected to change upon re-opening. Point estimates with uncertainty were determined by a formal performance-based algorithm. Additionally, we surveyed school Headteachers about risk mitigation strategies and their anticipated effectiveness.

ResultsExpert elicitation provides estimates of contact patterns that are consistent with contact surveys. We report mean number of contacts per day for four cohorts within schools along with a range at 90% confidence for the variations of contacts among individuals. Prior to lockdown, we estimate that, mean numbers per day, younger children (Reception and Year 1) made 15 contacts [range 8..35] within school, older children (Year 6) 18 contacts [range 5.. 55], teaching staff 25 contacts [range 4.. 55) and non-classroom staff 11 contacts [range 2.. 27]. Compared to pre-COVID times, after schools re-opened the mean number of contacts were reduced by about 53% for young children, about 62% for older children, about 60% for classroom staff and about 64% for other staff. Contacts between teaching and non-teaching staff reduced by 80%, which is consistent with other independent estimates. The distributions of contacts per person are asymmetric indicating a heavy tail of individuals with high contact numbers.

ConclusionsWe interpret the reduction in childrens contacts as a consequence of efforts to reduce mixing with interventions such as forming groups of children (bubbles) who are organized to learn together to limit contacts. Distributions of contacts for children and adults can be used to inform COVID-19 transmission modelling. Our findings suggest that while official DfE guidelines form the basis for risk mitigation in schools, individual schools have adopted their own bespoke strategies, often going beyond the guidelines.","Sparks, S.

26368,Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in social housing areas in Denmark,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is suggested to be more prevalent among ethnic minorities and individuals with low socioeconomic status. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during the COVID-19 pandemic among citizens 15 years or older in Denmark living in social housing (SH) areas.

MethodsAs part of """"Testing Denmark"""", a nationwide sero-epidemiological surveillance survey, we conducted a study between January 8th and January 31st, 2021 with recruitment in 13 selected SH areas in Denmark. Participants were offered a point-of-care rapid SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody test and a questionnaire concerning previous testing (viral throat- and nasopharyngeal swab or antibody test), test results for COVID-19, demographics, household characteristics, employment, risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and history of symptoms associated with COVID-19. Data on seroprevalence from Danish blood donors in same period using a total Ig ELISA assay were used as a proxy for the general Danish population.

FindingsOf the 13,279 included participants, 2,296 (17.3%) were seropositive (mean age 46.6 (SD 16.4) years, 54.2% female), which was 3 times higher than in the general Danish population (mean age 41.7 (SD 14.1) years, 48.5% female) in the same period (5.8%, risk ratios (RR) 2.96, 95% CI 2.78-3.16, p>0.001). Seropositivity was higher among males than females (RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.05-1.22%, p=0.001) and increased with age, with an OR seropositivity of 1.03 for each 10-year increase in age (95% CI 1.00-1.06, p=0.031). Close contact with COVID-19-infected individuals was associated with a higher risk of infection, especially among members of the same households (OR 5.0, 95% CI 4.1-6.2 p<0,001). Adjusted for age, gender and region living at least 4 people in a household significantly increased the OR of seropositivity (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.6, p=0.02) as did living in a multi-generational household (OR 1.3 per generation, 95% CI 1.1-1.5, p=0.007). Only 1.6% of participants reported not following any of the national COVID-19 recommendations. Anosmia (RR 3.2 95% CI 2.8-3.7, p<0.001) and ageusia (RR 3.3, 95% CI 2.9-3.8, p<0.001) were strongest associated with seropositivity.

InterpretationDanish citizens living in SH areas of low socioeconomic status had a three times higher SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence compared to the general Danish population. The seroprevalence was significantly higher in males and increased with age. Living in multiple generations or more than four persons in a household was an independent risk factor for being seropositive. Results of this study can be used for future consideration of the need for preventive measures in the populations living in SH areas.","Fogh, K.; Eriksen, A. R.; Hasselbalch, R. B.; Kristensen, E.

Herein, we present the analysis of 6,515 SARS-CoV-2 sequences sampled in Italy between 29th January 2020 and 1st March 2021 and show how different lineages emerged multiple times independently despite lockdown restrictions. Virus lineage B.1.177 became the dominant variant in November 2020, when cases peaked at 40,000 a day, but since January 2021 this is being replaced by the B.1.1.7  variant of concern. In addition, we report a sudden increase in another documented variant of concern - lineage P.1 - from December 2020 onwards, most likely caused by a single introduction into Italy. We again highlight how international importations drive the emergence of new lineages and that genome sequencing should remain a top priority for ongoing surveillance in Italy.","Di Giallonardo, F.; Puglia, I.; Curini, V.; Camma, C.; Mangone, I.; Calistri, P.; Cobbin, J.

26685,SARS-CoV-2 transmission in K-12 schools in the Vancouver Coastal Health Region: a descriptive epidemiologic study,"BackgroundThere is an urgent need to assess the role of schools in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada to inform public health measures. We describe the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in students and staff in the Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) region in the first three months of the 2020/2021 academic year, and examine the extent of transmission in schools.

MethodsThis descriptive epidemiologic study using contact tracing data included all SARS-CoV-2 cases reported to VCH between September 10 and December 18, 2020 who worked in or attended K-12 schools in-person. Case and cluster characteristics were described.

ResultsThere were 699 school staff and student cases during the study period, for an incidence of 55 cases per 10,000 population, compared to 73 per 10,000 population in all VCH residents. Among VCH resident staff and student cases, 53% were linked to a household case/cluster, <1.5% were hospitalized and there were no deaths. Out of 699 cases present at school, 26 clusters with school-based transmission resulted in 55 secondary cases. Staff members accounted for 54% of index cases (14/26) while comprising 14% of the school population. Among clusters, 88% had fewer than 4 secondary cases.

InterpretationCOVID-19 incidence in the school population was lower than that of the general population. There were no deaths and severe disease was rare. School-based transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 were uncommon and clusters were small. Our results support the growing body of evidence that schools do not play a major role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Bark, D.; Dhillon, N.; St-Jean, M.; Kinniburgh, B.; Mckee, G.; Choi, A.",2021-05-18,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.05.15.21257271,1,Alexandra Choi,"Office of the Chief Medical Health Officer, Vancouver Coastal Health, Vancouver BC",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.15.21257271v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.15.21257271v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
20078,Transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 on airplanes and high-speed trains,"Modern transportation plays a key role in the long-distance and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, little is known about the transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 on confined vehicles, such as airplanes and trains. Based on the itinerary and epidemiological data of COVID-19 cases and close contacts among 9,265 airline passengers on 291 airplanes and 29,335 passengers on 830 high-speed trains in China from December 20, 2019 to March 17, 2020, we estimated that the upper bound of overall attack rate of COVID-19 among passengers was 0.60% (95% confidence interval: 0.43%-0.84%) for airplanes and 0.35% (0.28%-0.44%) for trains departing from Wuhan before its lockdown, respectively. The reproduction number during travel ranged from 0.12 to 0.19 on airplanes and from 0.07 to 0.12 on trains, with the risk varying by seat distance from the index case and joint travel time, but the difference in risk was not significant between the types of aircraft and train. Overall, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on planes and high-speed trains with high efficiency air filtration devices was relatively low.

3034,Severe airport sanitarian control could slow down the spreading of COVID-19 pandemics in Brazil,"BackgroundWe investigated a likely scenario of COVID-19 spreading in Brazil through the complex airport network of the country, for the 90 days after the first national occurrence of the disease. After the confirmation of the first imported cases, the lack of a proper airport entrance control resulted in the infection spreading in a manner directly proportional to the amount of flights reaching each city, following first occurrence of the virus coming from abroad.

MethodologyWe developed a SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model divided in a metapopulation structure, where cities with airports were demes connected by the number of flights. Subsequently, we further explored the role of Manaus airport for a rapid entrance of the pandemic into indigenous territories situated in remote places of the Amazon region.

ResultsThe expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus between cities was fast, directly proportional to the airport closeness centrality within the Brazilian air transportation network. There was a clear pattern in the expansion of the pandemic, with a stiff exponential expansion of cases for all cities.

2255,Case fatality risk of novel coronavirus diseases 2019 in China,"ObjectiveThe outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) imposed a substantial health burden in mainland China and remains a global epidemic threat. Our objectives are to assess the case fatality risk (CFR) among COVID-19 patients detected in mainland China, stratified by clinical category and age group.

MethodsWe collected individual information on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases from publicly available official sources from December 29, 2019 to February 23, 2020. We explored the risk factors associated with mortality. We used methods accounting for right-censoring and survival analyses to estimate the CFR among detected cases.

ResultsOf 12,863 cases reported outside Hubei, we obtained individual records for 9,651 cases, including 62 deaths and 1,449 discharged cases. The deceased were significantly older than discharged cases (median age: 77 vs 39 years, p<0.001). 58% (36/62) were male. Older age (OR 1.18 per year; 95%CI: 1.14 to 1.22), being male (OR 2.02; 95%CI: 1.02 to 4.03), and being treated in less developed economic regions (e.g., West and Northeast vs. East, OR 3.93; 95%CI: 1.74 to 8.85) were mortality risk factors. The estimated CFR was 0.89-1.24% among all cases. The fatality risk among critical patients was 2-fold higher than that among severe and critical patients, and 24-fold higher than that among moderate, severe and critical patients.

ConclusionsOur estimates of CFR based on laboratory-confirmed cases ascertained outside of Hubei suggest that COVID-19 is not as severe as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but more similar to the mortality risk of 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in hospitalized patients. The fatality risk of COVID-19 is higher in males and increases with age. Our study improves the severity assessment of the ongoing epidemic and can inform the COVID-19 outbreak response in China and beyond.","Deng, X.; Yang, J.; Wang, W.; Wang, X.; Zhou, J.; Chen, Z.; Li, J.; Chen, Y.; Yan, H.; Zhang, J.; Zhang, Y.; Wang, Y.; Qiu, Q.; Gong, H.; Wei, X.; Wang, L.; Sun, K.; Wu, P.; Ajelli, M.; Cowling, B.

11800,A systematic review uncovers a wide-gap between COVID-19 in humans and animal models,"BackgroundAnimal models of COVID-19 have been rapidly reported after the start of the pandemic. We aimed to assess whether the newly created models reproduce the full spectrum of humans COVID-19.

MethodsWe searched the Medline, as well as BioRxiv and MedRxiv preprint servers for original research published in English from January 1, to May 20, 2020. We used the search terms """"COVID-19"""" OR """"SARS-CoV-2"""" AND, """"animal models"""", """"hamsters"""", """"nonhuman primates"""", """"macaques"""", """"rodent"""", """"mice"""", """"rats"""", """"ferrets"""", """"rabbits"""", """"cats"""", and """"dogs"""". Inclusion criteria were the establishment of animal models of COVID-19 as an endpoint. Other inclusion criteria were assessment of prophylaxis, therapies, or vaccines, using animal models of COVID-19.

Findings13 peer-reviewed studies and 14 preprints met inclusion criteria. The animals used were nonhuman primates (n=13), mice (n=7), ferrets (n=4), hamsters (n=4), and cats (n=1). All animals supported high viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract associated with mild clinical manifestations, lung pathology and full recovery. Older animals displayed relatively more severe illness than the younger ones. No animal models developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, multiple organ dysfunction, culminating in death. All species elicited a specific IgG antibodies response to the spike proteins, which were protective against a second exposure. Transient systemic inflammation was observed occasionally in Rhesus macaques, hamsters, and mice. Notably, none of the animals unveiled cytokine storm or coagulopathy.

ConclusionsMost of the animal models of COVID-19 recapitulated mild pattern of human COVID-19 with full recovery phenotype. No severe illness associated with mortality was observed, suggesting a wide gap between COVID-19 in humans and animal models.

7895,"Association of country-wide coronavirus mortality with demographics, testing, lockdowns, and public wearing of masks. Update August 4, 2020.","PurposeTo determine sources of variation between countries in per-capita mortality from COVID-19 (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus).

MethodsPotential predictors of per-capita coronavirus-related mortality in 200 countries by May 9, 2020 were examined, including age, sex, obesity prevalence, temperature, urbanization, smoking, duration of infection, lockdowns, viral testing, contact tracing policies, and public mask-wearing norms and policies. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed.

ResultsIn univariate analyses, the prevalence of smoking, per-capita gross domestic product, urbanization, and colder average country temperature were positively associated with coronavirus-related mortality. In a multivariable analysis of 196 countries, the duration of infection in the country, and the proportion of the population 60 years of age or older were positively associated with per-capita mortality, while duration of mask-wearing by the public was negatively associated with mortality (all p<0.001). International travel restrictions and a lower prevalence of obesity were independently associated with mortality in a model which controlled for testing policy. Internal lockdown requirements and viral testing policies and levels were not associated with mortality. The association of contact tracing policy with mortality approached statistical significance (p=0.06). In countries with cultural norms or government policies supporting public mask-wearing, per-capita coronavirus mortality increased on average by just 15.8% each week, as compared with 62.1% each week in remaining countries.

ConclusionsSocietal norms and government policies supporting the wearing of masks by the public, as well as international travel controls, are independently associated with lower per-capita mortality from COVID-19.","Leffler, C.

19703,Potential role of aberrant mucosal immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in pathogenesis of IgA Nephropathy,"Aberrant mucosal immunity has been suggested to play a pivotal role in pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), the most common form of glomerulonephritis worldwide. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the causal pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has become a global concern. However, whether the mucosal immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 influences the clinical manifestations of IgAN patients remains unknown. Here we tracked the SARS-CoV-2 anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody levels in a cohort of 88 COVID-19 patients. We found that 52.3% of the COVID-19 patients produced more SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgA than IgG or IgM, and the levels of the IgA were stable during 4-41 days of infection. Among these IgA-dominated COVID-19 patients, we found a severe COVID-19 patient concurrent with IgAN. The renal function of the patient declined presenting with increased serum creatinine during the infection and till 7 months post infection. This patient predominantly produced anti-RBD IgA as well as total IgA in the serum compared to that of healthy controls. The analysis of the IgA-coated microbiota as well as proinflammatory cytokine IL-18, which was mainly produced in the intestine, reveals intestinal inflammation, although no obvious gastrointestinal symptom was reported. The mucosal immune responses in the lung are not evaluated due to the lack of samples from respiratory tract. Collectively, our work highlights the potential adverse effect of the mucosal immune response towards SARS-CoV-2, and additional care should be taken for COVID-19 patients with chronic diseases like IgAN.","Zhang, Z.; Zhang, G.; Guo, M.; Tao, W.; Liu, X.; Wei, H.; Jin, T.; Zhang, Y.; Zhu, S.",2020-12-11,Nephrology,10.1101/2020.12.11.20247668,1,Shu Zhu,University of Science and Technology of China,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.11.20247668v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.11.20247668v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
12799,Magnitude and Dynamics of the T-Cell Response to SARS-CoV-2 Infection at Both Individual and Population Levels,"T cells are involved in the early identification and clearance of viral infections and also support the development of antibodies by B cells. This central role for T cells makes them a desirable target for assessing the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we combined two high-throughput immune profiling methods to create a quantitative picture of the T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2. First, at the individual level, we deeply characterized 3 acutely infected and 58 recovered COVID-19 subjects by experimentally mapping their CD8 T-cell response through antigen stimulation to 545 Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I presented viral peptides (class II data in a forthcoming study). Then, at the population level, we performed T-cell repertoire sequencing on 1,815 samples (from 1,521 COVID-19 subjects) as well as 3,500 controls to identify shared """"public"""" T-cell receptors (TCRs) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection from both CD8 and CD4 T cells. Collectively, our data reveal that CD8 T-cell responses are often driven by a few immunodominant, HLA-restricted epitopes. As expected, the T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 peaks about one to two weeks after infection and is detectable for at least several months after recovery. As an application of these data, we trained a classifier to diagnose SARSCoV-2 infection based solely on TCR sequencing from blood samples, and observed, at 99.8% specificity, high early sensitivity soon after diagnosis (Day 3-7 = 85.1% [95% CI = 79.9-89.7]; Day 8-14 = 94.8% [90.7-98.4]) as well as lasting sensitivity after recovery (Day 29+/convalescent = 95.4% [92.1-98.3]). These results demonstrate an approach to reliably assess the adaptive immune response both soon after viral antigenic exposure (before antibodies are typically detectable) as well as at later time points. This blood-based molecular approach to characterizing the cellular immune response has applications in clinical diagnostics as well as in vaccine development and monitoring.","Snyder, T.

9479,Point of care lung ultrasound is useful when screening for CoVid-19 in Emergency Department patients.,"BackgroundCoVid-19 can be a life-threatening lung disease or a trivial upper respiratory infection depending on whether the alveoli are involved. Emergency department (ED) screening in symptomatic patients with normal vital signs is frequently limited to oro-nasopharyngeal swabs. We tested the null hypothesis that patients being screened for CoVid-19 in the ED with normal vital signs and without hypoxia would have a point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS) consistent with CoVid-19 less than 2% of the time.

MethodsO_ST_ABSSubjectsC_ST_ABSSubjects were identified from ED ultrasound logs.

Inclusion criteriaAge 14 years or older with symptoms prompting ED screening for CoVid-19.

Exclusion criteriaKnown congestive heart failure or other chronic lung condition likely to cause excessive B lines on LUS.

InterventionStructured blinded ultrasound review and chart review

AnalysisWe used a two-sided exact hypothesis test for binomial random variables. We also measured LUS diagnostic performance using computed tomography as the gold standard.

ResultsWe reviewed 77 charts; 49 met inclusion criteria. Vital signs were normal in 30/49 patients; 10 (33%) of these patients had LUS consistent with CoVid-19. We rejected the null hypothesis (p-value < 0.001). The treating physicians interpretation of their own point of care lung ultrasounds had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 75%, 100%) and specificity of 80% (95% CI 68%, 89%).

ConclusionLUS has a meaningful detection rate for CoVid-19 in symptomatic ED patients with normal vital signs. We recommend at least LUS be used in addition to PCR testing when screening symptomatic ED patients for CoVid-19.

Capsule What is knownAuscultation and chest x-ray are insufficient to screen for lung involvement when SARS-CoV-2 infection is suspected. Point of care lung ultrasound is widely available, safer, and less resource intensive than CT imaging.

What we foundIn symptomatic patients presenting to the ED even those with normal vital signs had point of care lung ultrasound evidence of alveolar level involvement 33%of patients. Point of care lung ultrasound was 100% sensitive and 80% specific compared to CT (reference standard) when evaluating patients for Covid-19.

What this addsPoint of care lung ultrasound or similar imaging should performed when screening symptomatic patients in whom SARS-CoV-2 infection is suspected.","Hankins, A.; Bang, H.; Walsh, P.",2020-06-12,Emergency Medicine,10.1101/2020.06.09.20123836,1,Paul Walsh,"Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Sutter Medical Center Sacramento, 2825 Capitol Avenue, Sacramento, CA 95816",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.09.20123836v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.09.20123836v1.full.pdf,cc_by,"NA"
13472,"A simple numerical and analytical analysis of Covid-19 progression, infection inhibition and control in various countries","Covid-19 disease outspread and its subsequent control and inhibition strategies in various countries have been different which led to quite drastic difference in the outcome of the disease progression. In this paper we present an analytical and numerical study of Covid-19 disease spread and control by applying the modified SIR model of epidemic outbreak to explain the Covid spread from February-July 2020 in various countries. Two approaches are evident from the disease progression; one focused on disease eradication and inhibition, and the other is less restrictive dynamic response. Both the approaches are analytically modeled to determine the parameters that characterize the effectiveness of dealing with the disease progression. The model successfully explains the Covid-19 evolution and control of various countries over a vast span of four-five months. The study is highly beneficial to simply analytically and numerically model this complex problem of epidemic proliferation. It assists to easily determine the mathematical parameters for the Covid-19 control measures, helps in predicting the end of the epidemic, and most importantly conceiving the judicious way of unlock process to restore communication between cities, states and countries.","Chakravarty, U.; Chaturvedi, D.; Joshi, M.

19356,A cross-national study of factors associated with perinatal mental health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BackgroundPregnant and postpartum women face unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic that may put them at elevated risk of mental health problems. However, few large-scale and no cross-national studies have been conducted to date that investigate modifiable pandemic-related behavioral or cognitive factors that may influence mental health in this vulnerable group. This international study sought to identify and measure the associations between pandemic-related information seeking, worries, and prevention behaviors on perinatal mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods and FindingsAn anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey of pregnant and postpartum women was conducted in 64 countries between May 26 2020 and June 13 2020. The survey, available in twelve languages, was hosted on the Pregistry platform for COVID-19 studies (https://corona.pregistry.com), and advertised predominantly in social media channels and online parenting forums. Participants completed measures on demographic characteristics, COVID-19 exposure and worries, media exposure, COVID-19 prevention behaviors, and mental health symptoms including posttraumatic stress symptoms via the IES-6, anxiety/depression via the PHQ-4, and loneliness via the UCLA-3. Of the 6,894 participants, substantial proportions of women scored at or above the cut-offs for elevated posttraumatic stress (2,979 [43%]), anxiety/depression (2,138 [31%], and loneliness (3,691 [53%]). Information seeking from any source (e.g., social media, news, talking to others) five or more times per day was associated with more than twice the odds of elevated posttraumatic stress and anxiety/depression, in adjusted models. A large majority of women (86%) reported being somewhat or very worried about COVID-19. The most commonly reported worries were related to pregnancy and delivery, including family being unable to visit after delivery (59%), the baby contracting COVID-19 (59%), lack of a support person during delivery (55%), and COVID-19 causing changes to the delivery plan (41%). Greater worries related to children (i.e. inadequate childcare, their infection risk) and missing medical appointments were associated with significantly higher odds of posttraumatic stress, anxiety/depression and loneliness. Engaging in hygiene-related COVID-19 prevention behaviors (face mask-wearing, washing hands, disinfecting surfaces) were not related to mental health symptoms or loneliness.

ConclusionsClinically significant posttraumatic stress, anxiety/depression, and loneliness are highly prevalent in pregnant and postpartum women across 64 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Excessive information seeking and worries related to children and medical care are associated with clinically significant symptoms, whereas engaging in hygiene-related preventive measures were not. In addition to screening and monitoring mental health symptoms, reinforcing healthy information seeking, addressing worries about access to medical care and the well-being of their children, and strategies to target loneliness (e.g., online support groups) should be part of intervention efforts for perinatal women. Public and mental health interventions need to explicitly address the impact of COVID-19 on both physical and mental health in perinatal women, as prevention of viral exposure itself does not mitigate the mental health impact of the pandemic.","Basu, A.; Kim, H.

17027,"PREVALENCE OF ANTIBODIES AGAINST SARS-CoV-2 IN PROFESSIONALS OF A PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY AT SAO PAULO, SP, BRAZIL","BackgroundCovid-19 Serology may document exposure and perhaps protection to the virus and serological test may help understand epidemic dynamics. We tested health workers form a public laboratory to evaluate previous exposure to the virus and estimate the prevalence of antibodies against-SARS-CoV-2 in Adolfo Lutz Institute, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil.

MethodsThis study was an open, prospective evaluation among professionals of Adolfo Lutz Institute some administrative personnel from the Secretary of Health that shares common areas with the institute. We used a lateral flow immunoassay (rapid test) to detect IgG and IgM for SARS-CoV-2; positive samples were further evaluated using Roche Electrochemiluminescence assay. SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was also offered to participants.

ResultsA total of 406 HPs participated. Thirty five (8.6%) tested positive on rapid test and 32 these rapid test seropositive cases were confirmed by ECLIA. 43 HPs had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected at a median of 33 days, and the three cases not reactive at Roche ECLIA had a previous positive RNA. Outsourced professionals (34% seropositive), males (15%) workers referring COVID-19 patients at home (22%) and those living farther form the institute tended to have higher prevalence of seropositivity, but in multivariable logistic analysis only outsourced workers and those with COVID patients at home remained independently associated to seropositivity. We observed no relation of seropositivity to COVID samples handling. Presence of at least one symptom was common but some clinical manifestations as anosmia/dysgeusia. Fatigue, cough and fever were associated to seropositivity.

ConclusionsWe documented a relatively high (8.6%) of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological reactivity in this population, higher among outsourced workers and those residing with COVID-19 patients. COVID related work did not increased seropositivity. Some symptoms show strong association to COVID-19 serology and may be used in scoring tools for screening or diagnosis in resort limited settings.","Silva, V. O.; De Oliveira, E. L.; Castejon, M.

14549,Validating and modeling the impact of high-frequency rapid antigen screening on COVID-19 spread and outcomes,"High frequency screening of populations has been proposed as a strategy in facilitating control of the COVID-19 pandemic. We use computational modeling, coupled with clinical data from rapid antigen tests, to predict the impact of frequent viral antigen rapid testing on COVID-19 spread and outcomes. Using patient nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens, we demonstrate that the sensitivity/specificity of two rapid antigen tests compared to quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) are 82.0%/100% and 84.7%/85.7%, respectively; moreover, sensitivity correlates directly with viral load. Based on COVID-19 data from three regions in the United States and Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Brazil, we show that high frequency, strategic population-wide rapid testing, even at varied accuracy levels, diminishes COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths at a fraction of the cost of nucleic acid detection via qRT-PCR.

5797,Comparison of the Clinical Implications among Two Different Nutritional Indices in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease.It was first reported in Wuhan, China, and then broke out on a large scale around the world.This study aimed to assess the clinical significance of two different nutritional indices in 245 patients with COVID-19.

MethodsIn this retrospective single-center study, we finally included 245 consecutive patients who confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital from January 1 to February 29. Cases were classified as either discharged or dead. Demographic, clinical and laboratory datas were registered, two different nutritional indices were calculated: (i)the Controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score; (ii) prognostic nutritional index (PNI). We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to explore the relationship between nutritional indices and hospital death.

Results212 of them were discharged and 33 of them died. In-hospital mortality was signifcantly higher in the severe group of PNI than in the moderate and normal groups. It was also significantly worse in the severe-CONUT group than in the moderate-, mild-, and normal-CONUT groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the CONUT score (odds ratio3.371,95%CI (1.124-10.106), p = 0.030) and PNI(odds ratio 0.721,95% CI (0.581-0.896), P=0.003) were independent predictors of all-cause death at an early stage; Multivariate logistic regression analysis also showed that the severe group of PNI was the independent risk predictor of in-hospital death(odds ratio 24.225, 95% CI(2.147-273.327), p=0.010).The CONUT score cutoff value was 5.5 (56.00 and 80.81%; AUC 0.753; 95% CI (0.644-0.862); respectively). The PNI cutoff value was 40.58 (81.80 and 66.20%; AUC 0.778; 95% CI (0.686-0.809); respectively).

24071,"Within-country age-based prioritisation, global allocation, and public health impact of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: a mathematical modelling analysis","The worldwide endeavour to develop safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines has been extraordinary, and vaccination is now underway in many countries. However, the doses available in 2021 are likely to be limited. We extended a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission across different country settings to evaluate the public health impact of potential vaccines using WHO-developed target product profiles. We identified optimal vaccine allocation strategies within- and between-countries to maximise averted deaths under constraints on dose supply. We found that the health impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination depends on the cumulative population-level infection incidence when vaccination begins, the duration of natural immunity, the trajectory of the epidemic prior to vaccination, and the level of healthcare available to effectively treat those with disease. Within a country we find that for a limited supply (doses for <20% of the population) the optimal strategy is to target the elderly. However, with a larger supply, if vaccination can occur while other interventions are maintained, the optimal strategy switches to targeting key transmitters to indirectly protect the vulnerable. As supply increases, vaccines that reduce or block infection have a greater impact than those that prevent disease alone due to the indirect protection provided to high-risk groups. Given a 2 billion global dose supply in 2021, we find that a strategy in which doses are allocated to countries proportional to population size is close to optimal in averting deaths and aligns with the ethical principles agreed in pandemic preparedness planning.

HighlightsO_LIThe global dose supply of COVID-19 vaccines will be constrained in 2021
C_LIO_LIWithin a country, prioritising doses to protect those at highest mortality risk is efficient
C_LIO_LIFor a 2 billion dose supply in 2021, allocating to countries according to population size is efficient and equitable

8703,Viral Dynamics Matter in COVID-19 Pneumonia: the success of early treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in Lebanon.,"1.1.1. Background/PurposeWe share our experience in COVID-19 pneumonia management at Saint George Hospital University Medical Center (SGHUMC) in Lebanon. In the absence of a standard of care, early diagnosis and opt-in therapy with Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin were offered.

1.2. MethodsWe reviewed records of COVID-19 pneumonia patients from March 16-April 26 2020. Based on NEWS score, we stratified patients as A: low B: medium, and C: high clinical severity and obtained pharmacotherapy data. Chest-CT-severity-score (CTSS) was used. We defined clinical cure as resolution of symptoms and biomarkers and virologic cure as a PCR above 35 cycles(Ct).

1.3. ResultsWe recorded 21 COVID-19 pneumonia patients of whom 19 opted for treatment. Clinical symptoms and laboratory markers at presentation did not significantly correlate with severity. Lower initial viral load significantly correlated with lower levels of clinical and radiological severity (p=0.038). Virologic cure, Ct>35, by day 10, was only 33% in high severity significantly less than categories A and B. We observed 100% clinical cure at day 10 in Category-A, 67% in B, and 33% in C(p<0.05). Patients with the lowest severity had the fastest virologic cure in a mean of 5.8 days from diagnosis, shortest hospitalization and earlier radiological improvement(p<0.005). Ultimately, 18 patients were discharged home in good condition and one remains in the ICU.

1.4. ConclusionViral dynamics matter in COVID-19 pneumonia. An early control of replication may be crucial in averting complications. Early administration of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin potentially explains our 94.7% success rate in treating a fairly complex cohort of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Chamieh, A.; Afif, C.; El-Hajj, G.; Zmerli, O.; Djaffar-Jureidini, I.; Raad, R.

8386,"Causal Impact of Masks, Policies, Behavior on Early Covid-19 Pandemic in the U.S.","The paper evaluates the dynamic impact of various policies adopted by US states on the growth rates of confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths as well as social distancing behavior measured by Google Mobility Reports, where we take into consideration peoples voluntarily behavioral response to new information of transmission risks in a causal structural model framework. Our analysis finds that both policies and information on transmission risks are important determinants of Covid-19 cases and deaths and shows that a change in policies explains a large fraction of observed changes in social distancing behavior. Our main counterfactual experiments suggest that nationally mandating face masks for employees early in the pandemic could have reduced the weekly growth rate of cases and deaths by more than 10 percentage points in late April and could have led to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives. We also find that, without stay-at-home orders, cases would have been larger by 6 to 63 percent and without business closures, cases would have been larger by 17 to 78 percent. We find considerable uncertainty over the effects of school closures due to lack of cross-sectional variation; we could not robustly rule out either large or small effects. Overall, substantial declines in growth rates are attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well. We also carry out sensitivity analyses to find neighborhoods of the models under which the results hold robustly: the results on mask policies appear to be much more robust than the results on business closures and stay-at-home orders. Finally, we stress that our study is observational and therefore should be interpreted with great caution. From a completely agnostic point of view, our findings uncover predictive effects (association) of observed policies and behavioral changes on future health outcomes, controlling for informational and other confounding variables.","Chernozhukov, V.; Kasahara, H.; Schrimpf, P.",2020-09-12,Health Economics,10.1101/2020.05.27.20115139,6,Victor Chernozhukov,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.20115139v6?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.20115139v6.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.09.003
9956,"Effect of evacuation of Japanese residents from Wuhan, China, on preventing transmission of novel coronavirus infection: a modelling study","ObjectiveIn late January 2020, the Japanese government carried out three evacuations by aircraft from Wuhan, China, to avoid further cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among Wuhans Japanese residents. Evacuation by aircraft may be an effective countermeasure against outbreaks of infectious diseases, but evidence of its effect is scarce. This study estimated how many COVID-19 cases were prevented among the Japanese residents of Wuhan by the evacuation countermeasure.

ResultsEleven imported COVID-19 cases were reported on Feb 1 from among the total 566 evacuees who returned to Japan. In the case of no evacuations being made, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases among Wuhans Japanese residents was estimated to reach 25 (95% CI [20, 29]) on Feb 8 and 34 (95% CI [28, 40]) on Feb 15. A 1-week delay in the evacuation might be led to 14 additional cases and a 2-week delay to 23 additional cases. Evacuation by aircraft can contribute substantially to reducing the number of infected cases in the initial stage of the outbreak.","Asai, Y.; Tsuzuki, S.; Kutsuna, S.; Hayakawa, K.; Ohmagari, N.",2020-06-18,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.17.20133520,1,Shinya Tsuzuki,National Center for Global Health and Medicine,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.17.20133520v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.17.20133520v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.jiac.2020.12.011
21990,Extremely high SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a strictly-Orthodox Jewish community in the UK,"BackgroundEthnic and religious minorities have been disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. The UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish community has been severely affected by the pandemic. This group shares characteristics with other ethnic minorities including larger family sizes, higher rates of household crowding and relative socioeconomic deprivation. We studied a UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish population to understand how COVID-19 had spread within this community.

MethodsWe performed a household-focused cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey specific to three antigen targets. Randomly-selected households completed a standardised questionnaire and underwent serological testing with a multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We report clinical illness and testing before the serosurvey, seroprevalence stratified by age and gender. We used random-effects models to identify factors associated with infection and antibody titres.

FindingsA total of 343 households, consisting of 1,759 individuals, were recruited. Serum was available for 1,242 participants. The overall seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was 64.3% (95% CI 61.6-67.0%). The lowest seroprevalence was 27.6% in children under 5 years and rose to 73.8% in secondary school children and 74% in adults. Antibody titres were higher in symptomatic individuals and declined over time since reported COVID-19 symptoms, with the decline more marked for nucleocapsid titres.

InterpretationIn this tight-knit religious minority population in the UK, we report one of the highest SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence levels in the world to date. In the context of this high force of infection, all age groups experienced a high burden of infection. Actions to reduce the burden of disease in this and other minority populations are urgently required.

FundingThis work was jointly funded by UKRI and NIHR [COV0335; MR/V027956/1], a donation from the LSHTM Alumni COVID-19 response fund, HDR UK, the MRC and the Wellcome Trust. The funders had no role in the design, conduct or analysis of the study or the decision to publish.

Research In ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSIn January 2020, we searched PubMed for articles on rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst ethnic minority groups and amongst the Jewish population. Search teams included """"COVID-19"""", """"SARS-CoV-2"""", seroprevalence, """"ethnic minority"""", and """"Jewish"""" with no language restrictions. We also searched UK government documents on SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst minority groups. By January 2020, a large number of authors had reported that ethnic minority groups experienced higher numbers of cases and increased hospitalisations due to COVID-19. A small number of articles provided evidence that strictly-Orthodox Jewish populations had experienced a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection but extremely limited data was available on overall population level rates of infection amongst specific ethnic minority population groups. There was also extremely limited data on rates of infection amongst young children from ethnic minority groups.

Added value of the studyWe report findings from a population representative, household survey of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst a UK strictly Orthodox Jewish population. We demonstrate an extremely high seroprevalence rate of SARS-CoV-2 in this population which is more than five times the estimated seroprevalence nationally and five times the estimated seroprevalence in London. In addition the large number of children in our survey, reflective of the underlying population structure, allows us to demonstrate that in this setting there is a significant burden of disease in all age groups with secondary school aged children having an equivalent seroprevalence to adults.

Implications of the available evidenceOur data provide clear evidence of the markedly disproportionate impact of SARS-CoV-2 in minority populations. In this setting infection occurs at high rates across all age groups including pre-school, primary school and secondary school-age children. Contextually appropriate measures to specifically reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 amongst minority populations are urgently required.","Gaskell, K. M.; Johnson, M.; Gould, V.; Hunt, A.; Stone, N.

ObjectiveWe characterized the incidence of PASC, or related symptoms and diagnoses, for COVID-19 and influenza patients.

DesignRetrospective cohort study.

SettingOur data sources were the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE), Optum Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) databases that were transformed to the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) and were part of the Observational Health Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) network.

ParticipantsThe COVID-19 cohort consisted of patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 or positive lab test of SARS-CoV-2 after January 1st 2020 with a follow up period of at least 30 days. The influenza cohort consisted of patients with a diagnosis of influenza between October 1, 2018 and May 1, 2019 with a follow up period of at least 30 days.

InterventionInfection with COVID-19 or influenza.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresPost-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), or related diagnoses, for COVID-19 and influenza patients.

ResultsIn aggregate, we characterized the post-acute experience for over 440,000 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 or tested positive for SARS-COV-2. The long term sequelae that had a higher incidence in the COVID-19 compared to Influenza cohorts were altered smell or taste, myocarditis, acute kidney injury, dyspnea and alopecia. Additionally, the long term incidences of respiratory illness, musculoskeletal disease, and psychiatric disorders for the COVID-19 population were higher than expected.

Conclusions and RelevanceThe long term sequelae of COVID-19 and influenza may be different.

11378,Addition of Tocilizumab to the standard of care reduces mortality in severe COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"IntroductionTocilizumab is an anti-interleukin-6 antibody that has been used for the treatment of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the concrete evidence of its benefit in reducing the mortality in severe COVID-19 is lacking. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant studies that compared the efficacy of Tocilizumab in severe COVID-19 vs. standard of care alone.

MethodsLiterature search for studies that compared  Tocilizumab and  Standard of care in the treatment of COVID-19 was done using major online databases from December 2019 to June 14th, 2020. Search words   Tocilizumab,  anti-interleukin-6 antibody, and  COVID-19 or  coronavirus 2019 in various combinations were used. Articles in the form of abstracts, letters without original data, case reports, and reviews were excluded. Data was gathered on an excel sheet, and statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3.

ResultsSixteen studies were eligible from 693 initial studies, including 3,641 patients (64% males). There were thirteen retrospective studies and three prospective studies. There were 2,488 patients in the standard of care group (61.7%) and 1,153 patients (68.7%) in the Tocilizumab group. The death rate in the tocilizumab group, 22.4% (258/1153), was lower than the standard of care group, 26.21% (652/2,488) (Pooled odds ratio 0.57 [95% CI 0.36-0.92] p=0.02). There was a significant heterogeneity (Inconsistency index= 80%) among the included studies.

ConclusionThe addition of Tocilizumab to the standard of care might reduce the mortality in severe COVID-19.

25698,Estimating the total morbidity burden of COVID-19,"BackgroundCalculations of disease burden of COVID-19 are used to allocate scarce resources and historically have focused on mortality, with little attention to morbidity such as postviral  post-COVID, similar to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), which strikes 4 and 16% of male and female survivors. This paper quantifies post-COVID disability burden and combines it with case fatality to estimate total morbidity per COVID-19 case.

MethodsHealthy life years lost per COVID-19 case were computed as the sum of (incidence*disability weight*remaining lifespan) for death and post-COVID (modeled as CFS) by sex and 10-year age category. In addition to death, the main model considered lifelong mild, moderate or severe CFS; Model 2, CFS which resolved in ten years; Model 3, no CFS but 10% risk of death 10 years later.

ResultsIn all models, acute mortality was only a small share of total morbidity. For lifelong moderate CFS symptoms, healthy years lost per COVID-19 case ranged from 0.92 (male in his 30s) to 5.71 (girl under 10) and were 3.5 and 3.6 for the oldest females and males. At higher symptom severities, young people and females bore larger shares of total morbidity; if symptoms were persistent or survivors later mortality increased, young people of both sexes were at highest risk.

ConclusionsCompared to post-COVID, acute mortality contributes only a small share of total COVID-19 morbidity. Total burden falls heavily on the young, who are currently deprioritized for preventive interventions such as vaccines. To fairly allocate scarce resources, decisionmakers should consider all morbidity.","Smith, M.

23873,Impact of School Reopening on Pandemic Spread: A Case Study using an Agent-Based Model for COVID-19,"This article examines the impact of partial/full reopening of school/college campuses on the spread of a pandemic using COVID-19 as a case study. The study uses an agent-based simulation model that replicates community spread in an urban region of U.S.A. via daily social mixing of susceptible and infected individuals. Data representing population demographics, SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, and social interventions guides the models behavior, which is calibrated and validated using data reported by the government. The model indicates a modest but significant increase (8.15 %) in the total number of reported cases in the region for a complete (100%) reopening compared to keeping schools and colleges fully virtual. For partial returns of 75% and 50%, the percent increases in the number of reported cases are shown to be small (2.87% and 1.26%, respectively) and statistically insignificant. The AB model also predicts that relaxing the stringency of the school safety protocol for sanitizing, use of mask, social distancing, testing, and quarantining and thus allowing the school transmission coefficient to double may result in a small increase in the number of reported infected cases (2.14%). Hence for pandemic outbreaks from viruses with similar characteristics as for SARS-CoV-2, keeping the schools and colleges open with a modest campus safety protocol and in-person attendance below a certain threshold may be advisable.","Tatapudi, H.

4929,Why does COVID-19 case fatality rate vary among countries?,"BackgroundWhile the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 is spreading worldwide, there is much concern over the mortality rate that the infection induces. Available data suggest that COVID-19 case fatality rate varies temporally (as the epidemic progresses) and spatially (among countries). Here, we attempted to identify key factors possibly explaining the variability in case fatality rate across countries.

MethodsWe used data on the temporal trajectory of case fatality rate provided by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, and country-specific data on different metrics describing the incidence of known comorbidity factors associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality at the individual level (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation). We also compiled data on demography, economy and political regimes for each country.

FindingsWe first showed that temporal trajectories of case fatality rate greatly vary among countries. We found no evidence for association between comorbidities and case fatality rate at the country level. Case fatality rate was negatively associated with number of hospital beds x1,000 inhabitants. We also report evidence suggesting an association between case fatality rate and the political regime, with democracies suffering from the highest mortality burden, compared to autocratic regimes. However, most of the among-country variance in case fatality rate remained unexplained.

InterpretationOverall, these results emphasize the role of socio-economic and political factors as possible drivers of COVID-19 case fatality rate at the country level.

15881,Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19: A living systematic review,"Objective This living systematic review aims to provide a timely, rigorous and continuously updated summary of the evidence available on the role of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 Methods We adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. Eligible studies were randomised trials evaluating the effect of remdesivir versus placebo or no treatment. We conducted searches in the LOVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that maps PICO questions to a repository maintained through regular searches in electronic databases, preprint servers, trial registries and other resources relevant to COVID-19. All the searches covered the period until 25 August 2020. No date or language restrictions were applied. Two reviewers independently evaluated potentially eligible studies according to predefined selection criteria, and extracted data on study characteristics, methods, outcomes, and risk of bias, using a predesigned, standardised form. We performed meta-analyses using random-effect models and assessed overall certainty in evidence using the GRADE approach. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. Results Our search strategy yielded 574 references. Finally, we included 3 randomised trials evaluating remdesivir in addition to standard care versus standard care alone. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of remdesivir on mortality (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.05; very low certainty evidence) and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.24; very low certainty evidence). On the other hand, remdesivir likely results in a large reduction in the incidence of adverse effects in patients with COVID-19 (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.84; moderate certainty evidence). Conclusions The evidence is insufficient for the outcomes critical for making decisions about the role of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, so it is not possible to balance the potential benefits, if any, with the adverse effects and costs.

2758,"A Tool to Early Predict Severe 2019-Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (COVID-19) : A Multicenter Study using the Risk Nomogram in Wuhan and Guangdong, China","BackgroundDue to no reliable risk stratification tool for severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients at admission, we aimed to construct an effective model for early identifying cases at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19.

MethodsIn this retrospective three-centers study, 372 non-severe COVID-19 patients during hospitalization were followed for more than 15 days after admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and patients who kept non-severe state were assigned to the severe and non-severe group, respectively. Based on baseline data of the two groups, we constructed a risk prediction nomogram for severe COVID-19 and evaluate its performance.

ResultsThe train cohort consisted of 189 patients, while the two independent validation cohorts consisted of 165 and 18 patients. Among all cases, 72 (19.35%) patients developed severe COVID-19. We found that old age, and higher serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, the coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width, blood urea nitrogen, direct bilirubin, lower albumin, are associated with severe COVID-19. We generated the nomogram for early identifying severe COVID-19 in the train cohort (AUC 0.912 [95% CI 0.846-0.978], sensitivity 85.71%, specificity 87.58%); in validation cohort (0.853 [0.790-0.916], 77.5%, 78.4%). The calibration curve for probability of severe COVID-19 showed optimal agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation. Decision curve and clinical impact curve analysis indicated that nomogram conferred high clinical net benefit.

ConclusionOur nomogram could help clinicians to early identify patients who will exacerbate to severe COVID-19, which will enable better centralized management and early treatment of severe patients.

SummaryOlder age; higher LDH, CRP, RDW, DBIL, BUN; lower ALB on admission correlated with higher odds of severe COVID-19. An effective prognostic nomogram composed of 7 features could allow early identification of patients at risk of exacerbation to severe COVID-19.","Gong, J.; Ou, J.; Qiu, X.; Jie, Y.; Chen, Y.; Yuan, L.; Cao, J.; Tan, M.; Xu, W.; Zheng, F.; Shi, Y.; Hu, B.",2020-04-22,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.03.17.20037515,2,Bo Hu,Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037515v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037515v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1093/cid/ciaa443
15261,COVID-19 pandemic increased the magnitude of mortality risks associated with cold temperature in Italy: A nationwide time-stratified case-crossover study,"Abstract Backgrounds: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and some containment measures have changed many people lives and behaviours. Whether the pandemic could change the association between cold temperature and mortality remains unknown. Objectives: We aimed to assess whether the association between cold temperature and all-cause mortality in the pandemic period has changed compared to non-COVID-19 period (2015-2019) in Italy. Methods: We collected daily all-cause mortality data and meteorological data for 107 Italian provinces from 1, January 2015 to 31, May 2020. A time-stratified case-crossover design with the distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine the association between cold temperature and all-cause mortality during the first three months (from March to May in 2020) of the COVID-19 outbreak and the same months in 2015-2019. Results: The relative risk (RR) of all-cause mortality at extreme cold temperature (2.5th percentile of temperature at 3 {degrees}C) in comparison with the minimum mortality temperature (24 {degrees}C) was 4.75 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.90-5.79] in the pandemic period, which is more than triple higher than RR [1.41 (95%CI: 1.33-1.50)] in the same months during 2015-2019. The shift in cold-mortality association was particularly significant for people aged 65-74 years [RR (95%CI): 5.98 (3.78-9.46) in 2020 versus 1.29 (1.10-1.51) in 2015-2019], 75-84 years [5.25 (3.79-7.26) versus 1.40 (1.25-1.56)], and [&ge;] 85 years [5.03 (3.90-6.51) versus 1.52 (1.39-1.66)], but not significant for those aged 0-64 years [1.95 (1.17-3.24) versus 1.24 (1.05-1.48)]. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic enhanced the risk of cold temperature on mortality in Italy, particularly among the elderly people. Further studies are warranted to understand the exact mechanism when detailed data are available.","Yu, W.; Xu, R.; Ye, T.; Han, C.; Li, S.; Guo, Y.",2020-09-18,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.09.15.20194944,1,Yuming Guo,Monash University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.15.20194944v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.15.20194944v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
4423,Evaluation of lockdown impact on SARS-CoV-2 dynamics through viral genome quantification in Paris wastewaters,"SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of COVID-19. Most of SARS-CoV-2 carriers are assumed to exhibit no or mild non-specific symptoms. Thus, they may contribute to the rapid and mostly silent circulation of the virus among humans. Since SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples it has recently been proposed to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters (WW) as a complementary tool to investigate virus circulation in human populations. In the present work we assumed that the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters should correlate with the number of symptomatic or non-symptomatic carriers. To test this hypothesis, we performed a time-course quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR in raw wastewater samples collected from several major wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of the Parisian area. The study was conducted from 5 March to 23 April 2020, therefore including the lockdown period in France (since 17 March 2020). We confirmed that the increase of genome units in raw wastewaters accurately followed the increase of human COVID-19 cases observed at the regional level. Of note, the viral genomes could be detected before the beginning of the exponential growth of the epidemic. As importantly, a marked decrease in the quantities of genomes units was observed concomitantly with the reduction in the number of new COVID-19 cases which was an expected consequence of the lockdown. A s a conclusion, this work suggests that a quantitative monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters should bring important and additional information for an improved survey of SARS-CoV-2 circulation at the local or regional scale.","Wurtzer, S.; Marechal, V.; Mouchel, J.-M.; Maday, Y.; Teyssou, R.; Richard, E.; Almayrac, J.

19871,A safe protocol to identify low risk patients with COVID-19 pneumonia for outpatient management,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has made necessary to rationalize health-care resources, but there are no published data to this moment regarding ambulatory management of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

ObjectiveEvaluate the results of a protocol for ambulatory management of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia according to the rate of readmissions, admission into the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and deaths. Identify unfavorable prognostic factors that increase the risk of readmission, ICU admission and/or death.

MethodsProspective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia discharged from the emergency ward of Infanta Cristina Hospital (Madrid, Spain), that met the criteria of the hospital protocol for outpatient management. We describe outcomes of those patients and compare those who needed readmission versus those we did not. We use logistic regression to explore factors associated with readmissions.

Findings314 patients were included, of which 20 (6.4%) needed readmission, 3 (1%) developed severe respiratory failure, and none needed ICU admission nor died. 29.9% of patients had any one comorbidity. Hypertension, leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), increased aminotransferases were associated to a higher risk of readmission. A clinical course of 10 days or longer, and an absolute eosinophil count over 200/{micro}L were associated with a lower risk. After multivariate analysis, only hypertension (OR 4.99, CI 1.54-16.02), temperature over 38{degrees}C in the emergency ward (OR 9.03, CI: 1.89-45.77), leukopenia (OR 4.92, CI 1.42-17.11) and increased LDH (OR 6.62, CI 2.82-19.26) remained significantly associated to readmission.

ConclusionOutpatient management of patients with low-risk COVID-19 pneumonia is safe, if adequately selected. The protocol presented here has allowed avoiding 30% of the admissions for COVID-19 pneumonia in our hospital, with a very low readmission rate and non-existing mortality.

24902,No Evidence of Infectious SARS-CoV-2 in Human Milk: Analysis of a Cohort of 110 Lactating Women,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 infections of infants and toddlers are usually mild but can result in life-threatening disease. SARS-CoV-2 RNA been detected in the breast milk of lactating women, but the potential role of breastfeeding in transmission to infants has remained uncertain.

MethodsBreast milk specimens were examined for the presence of the virus by RT-PCR and/or culture. Specimens that contained viral RNA (vRNA) were examined for the presence of subgenomic coronavirus RNA (sgRNA), a putative marker of infectivity. Culture methods were used to determine the thermal stability of SARS-CoV-2 in human milk.

ResultsBreast milk samples from 110 women (65 confirmed with a SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test, 36 with symptoms but without tests, and 9 with symptoms but a negative SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test) were tested by RT-PCR (285 samples) and/or viral culture (160 samples). Although vRNA of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the milk of 7 of 110 (6%) women with either a confirmed infection or symptomatic illness, and in 6 of 65 (9%) of women with a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test, virus was not detected in any culture. None of the 7 milk specimens with detectable vRNA contained sgRNA. Notably, when artificially added to human milk in control experiments, infectious SARS-CoV-2 could be cultured despite several freeze-thaw cycles, as occurs in the storage and usage of human milk.

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 RNA can be found infrequently in the breastmilk of women with recent infection, but we found no evidence that breastmilk contains infectious virus or that breastfeeding represents a risk factor for transmission of infection to infants.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSSARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in a small number of human milk samples collected from recently infected women. The role of breastfeeding in transmission of the virus to infants has remained uncertain due to the small number of specimens analyzed in any study published thus far.

FindingsIn a total study group of 110 women, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in milk from 6 of 65 women (9.2%) with recent confirmed infection. Neither infectious virus nor subgenomic RNA (a marker of virus infectivity) were detected in any of the samples.

MeaningWe found no evidence that infectious SARS-CoV-2 is present milk from recently infected women, even if SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests are positive, providing reassurance of the safety of breastfeeding.","Krogstad, P.; Contreras, D.; Ng, H.; Tobin, N.; Chambers, C.; Bertrand, K.; Bode, L.; Aldrovandi, G.",2021-04-07,Pediatrics,10.1101/2021.04.05.21254897,1,Paul Krogstad,David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.05.21254897v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.05.21254897v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
23360,Characterizing all-cause excess mortality patterns during COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico,"BackgroundThe low testing rates, compounded by reporting delays, hinders the estimation of the mortality burden associated with the COVID-19 pandemic based on surveillance data alone. A more reliable picture of the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on mortality can be derived by estimating excess deaths above an expected level of death. In this study we aim to estimate the absolute and relative mortality impact of COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico in 2020 by gender and two geographic regions: Mexico City and the rest of the country.

MethodsWe obtained mortality time series due to all causes for Mexico, and by gender, and geographic region using epidemiological weeks from January to December 2020 and for preceding 5 years. We also compiled data on COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality to assess the timing and intensity of the pandemic in Mexico. We assembled weekly series of the number of tweets about  death from Mexico to assess the correlation between peoples media interaction about  death and the rise in pandemic deaths. We estimated all-cause excess mortality rates and mortality rate ratio increase over baseline by fitting Serfling regression models.

ResultsThe COVID-19 pandemic excess mortality rates per 10,000 population in Mexico between March 1, 2020 and January 2, 2021 was estimated at 26.10. The observed total number of deaths due to COVID-19 was 128,886 which is 38.64% of the total estimated excess deaths. Males had about 2-fold higher excess mortality rate (33.99) compared to females (18.53). The excess mortality rate for Mexico City (63.54) was about 2.7-fold higher than the rest of the country (23.25). Similarly, the mortality rate ratio relative to baseline was highest for Mexico City (RR: 2.09). There was no significant correlation between weekly number of tweets on  death and the weekly all-cause excess mortality rates ({rho}=0.309 (95% CI: 0.010, 0.558, p-value=0.043).

ConclusionThe excess mortality rate of 26.10 per 10,000 population corresponds to a total of 333,538 excess deaths in Mexico between March 1, 2020 to January 2, 2021. COVID-19 accounted for only 38.21% of the total excess deaths, which reflects either the effect of low testing rates in Mexico, or the surge in number of deaths due to other causes.","Dahal, S.; Banda, J.

3181,A mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission between frontliners and the general public,"The number of COVID-19 cases is continuously increasing in different countries (as of March 2020) including the Philippines. It is estimated that the basic reproductive number of COVID-19 is around 1.5 to 4. The basic reproductive number characterizes the average number of persons that a primary case can directly infect in a population full of susceptible individuals. However, there can be superspreaders that can infect more than this estimated basic reproductive number. In this study, we formulate a conceptual mathematical model on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 between the frontliners and the general public. We assume that the general public has a reproductive number between 1.5 to 4, and frontliners (e.g. healthcare workers, customer service and retail personnel, food service crews, and transport or delivery workers) have a higher reproduction number. Our simulations show that both the frontliners and the general public should be protected or resilient against the disease. Protecting only the frontliners will not result in flattening the epidemic curve. Protecting only the general public may flatten the epidemic curve but the infection risk faced by the frontliners is still high, which may eventually affect their work. Our simple model does not consider all factors involved in COVID-19 transmission in a community, but the insights from our model results remind us of the importance of community effort in controlling the transmission of the disease. All in all, the take-home message is that everyone in the community, whether a frontliner or not, should be protected or should implement preventive measures to avoid being infected.","Buhat, C. A.

10564,Memory-Dependent Model for the Dynamics of COVID-19 Pandemic,"COVID-19 pandemic has impacted people all across the world. As a result, there has been a collective effort to monitor, predict, and control the spread of this disease. Among this effort is the development of mathematical models that could capture accurately the available data and simulate closely the futuristic scenarios. In this paper, a fractional-order memory-dependent model for simulating the spread of COVID-19 is proposed. In this model, the impact of governmental action and public perception are incorporated as part of the time-varying transmission rate. The model simulation is performed using the two-step generalized exponential time-differencing method and tested for data from Wuhan, China. The mean-square errors demonstrate the merit of the fractional-order model and provide a good estimate of the optimal order.","Furati, K. M.; Sarumi, I. O.; Khaliq, A. Q.

5903,Excess mortality during COVID-19 in five European countries and a critique of mortality analysis data,"INTRODUCTIONThe COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing event disrupting lives, health systems, and economies worldwide. Clear data about the pandemics impact is lacking, namely regarding mortality. This work aims to study the impact of COVID-19 through the analysis of all-cause mortality data made available by different European countries, and to critique their mortality surveillance data.

METHODSEuropean countries that had publicly available data about the number of deaths per day/week were selected (England and Wales, France, Italy, Netherlands and Portugal). Two different methods were selected to estimate the excess mortality due to COVID19: (DEV) deviation from the expected value from homologue periods, and (RSTS) remainder after seasonal time series decomposition. We estimate total, age- and gender-specific excess mortality. Furthermore, we compare different policy responses to COVID-19.

RESULTSExcess mortality was found in all 5 countries, ranging from 10.6% in Portugal (DEV) to 98.5% in Italy (DEV). Furthermore, excess mortality is higher than COVID-attributed deaths in all 5 countries.

DISCUSSIONThe impact of COVID-19 on mortality appears to be larger than officially attributed deaths, in varying degrees in different countries. Comparisons between countries would be useful, but large disparities in mortality surveillance data could not be overcome. Unreliable data, and even a lack of cause-specific mortality data undermine the understanding of the impact of policy choices on both direct and indirect deaths during COVID-19. European countries should invest more on mortality surveillance systems to improve the publicly available data.","Felix-Cardoso, J.; Vasconcelos, H.; Rodrigues, P.; Cruz-Correia, R.",2020-05-02,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.28.20083147,1,Jorge Felix-Cardoso,Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Porto,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20083147v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20083147v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
14121,"Transfer learning to detect COVID-19 automatically from X-ray images, using convolutional neural networks","Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is a contagious disease that has already caused thousands of deaths and infected millions of people worldwide. Thus, all technological gadgets that allow the fast detection of COVID-19 infection with high accuracy can offer help to healthcare professionals. This study is purposed to explore the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in the rapid and reliable detection of COVID-19 based on chest X-ray imaging. In this study, reliable pre-trained deep learning algorithms were applied to achieve the automatic detection of COVID-19-induced pneumonia from digital chest X-ray images.

Moreover, the study aims to evaluate the performance of advanced neural architectures proposed for the classification of medical images over recent years. The data set used in the experiments involves 274 COVID-19 cases, 380 viral pneumonia, and 380 healthy cases, which was derived from several open sources of X-Rays, and the data available online. The confusion matrix provided a basis for testing the post-classification model. Furthermore, an open-source library PYCM was used to support the statistical parameters. The study revealed the superiority of Model vgg16 over other models applied to conduct this research where the model performed best in terms of overall scores and based-class scores. According to the research results, deep Learning with X-ray imaging is useful in the collection of critical biological markers associated with COVID-19 infection. The technique is conducive for the physicians to make a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Meanwhile, the high accuracy of this computer-aided diagnostic tool can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis.","Taresh, M.; Zhu, N.; Ali, T. A.

22388,The Missing Science: Epidemiological data gaps for COVID-19 policy in the United States,"We report on a scoping study of COVID-19 epidemiological data available for COVID-19 policy and management decisions for U.S. settings. We synthesize current US Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates for parameter of infectious transmission, infection severity, and disease burden, and summarize epidemiologic contributions to these parameters published by CDC-affiliated investigators through Oct 30, 2020. Authoritative estimates of most infectious transmission and infection severity parameters exist but rely primarily on data from studies conducted in non-U.S. populations. Estimates of secondary infection risks for household, workplace, school, or other community settings are lacking and estimates of the clinical fraction remain uncertain. The CDC reports multiple disease incidence and prevalence measures at national and state geographies, including some measures disaggregated by age group, race/ethnicity and sex; however, nationally uniform disease burden measures are not available at the sub-state level or for sub-populations defined by exposure setting, limiting opportunities for targeted interventions. CDC-affiliated investigators authored 133 quantitative studies on COVID-19 through Oct 30, 2020; however only 34 employed analytic methods. The remainder were descriptive. Of the 34 analytic studies, eleven reported on risk factors for infection, seven reported on risk factors for severe disease, three on symptomatic infections, three reported secondary infection risks, and four reported on indirect pandemic effects. Gaps remain in the epidemiological data required for an efficient and equitable public health policy response to COVID-19. The existence of these gaps one year after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need for standardizing data collection and research priorities and protocols in the context of a rapidly emerging infectious disease epidemics.","Bhatia, R.; Sledge, I.; Baral, S.",2021-02-15,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.02.11.21251602,1,Rajiv Bhatia,Stanford University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.11.21251602v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.11.21251602v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
5084,Modest effects of contact reduction measures on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 in the most affected European countries and the US,"Population density, behaviour and cultural habits strongly influence the spread of pathogens. Consequently, key epidemiological parameters may vary from country to country. Many estimates of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 strongly depend on testing frequency and case definitions. The fatal cases due to SARS-CoV2 could be a more reliable parameter, since missing of deaths is less likely. We analysed the dynamics of new infection and death cases to estimate the daily reproduction numbers (Rt) and the effectiveness of control measures in the most affected European Countries and the US. In summary, calculating Rt based on the daily number of deaths as well as of new infections may lead to more reliable estimates than those based on infection cases alone, as death based Rt are expected to be less susceptible to testing bias or limited capacities.","Ensser, A.; Überla, P.; Überla, K.",2020-04-24,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.20.20067538,1,Armin Ensser,"Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander Universitaet Erlangen-Nuernberg (FAU)",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.20067538v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.20067538v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
7528,Causal Modeling of Twitter Activity During COVID-19,"Understanding the characteristics of public attention and perception is an essential prerequisite for appropriate crisis management during adverse health events. This is even more crucial during a pandemic such as COVID-19, as primary responsibility of risk management is not centralized to a single institution, but distributed across society. While numerous studies utilize Twitter data in descriptive or predictive context during COVID-19 pandemic, causal modeling of public attention has not been investigated. In this study, we propose a causal inference approach to discover and quantify causal relationships between pandemic characteristics (e.g. number of infections and deaths) and Twitter activity as well as public sentiment. Our results show that the proposed method can successfully capture the epidemiological domain knowledge and identify variables that affect public attention and perception. We believe our work contributes to the field of infodemiology by distinguishing events that correlate with public attention from events that cause public attention.","Gencoglu, O.; Gruber, M.",2020-05-20,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.05.16.20103903,1,Oguzhan Gencoglu,Tampere University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.16.20103903v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.16.20103903v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3390/computation8040085
14052,Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transcriptional activity in cardiomyocytes of COVID-19 patients without clinical signs of cardiac involvement,"BackgroundCardiovascular complication in patients affected by novel Coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) are increasingly recognized. However, although a cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for inflammatory cells in autopsy heart samples of COVID-19 patients has been reported, the presence of the virus in cardiomyocytes has not been documented yet.

MethodsWe investigated for SARS-CoV-2 presence in heart tissue autopsies of 6 consecutive COVID-19 patients deceased for respiratory failure showing no signs of cardiac involvement and with no history of heart disease. Cardiac autopsy samples were analysed by digital PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, RNAScope, and transmission electron microscopy assays.

ResultsThe presence of SARS-CoV-2 into cardiomyocytes was invariably detected. A variable pattern of cardiomyocytes injury was observed, spanning from the absence of cell death and subcellular alterations hallmarks to the intracellular oedema and sarcomere ruptures. In addition, we found active viral transcription in cardiomyocytes, by detecting both sense and antisense SARS-CoV-2 spike RNA.

ConclusionsIn this analysis of autopsy cases, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 into cardiomyocytes, determining variable patterns of intracellular involvement, has been documented. All these findings suggest the need of a cardiologic surveillance even in survived COVID-19 patients not displaying a cardiac phenotype, in order to monitor potential long-term cardiac sequelae.","Bulfamante, G.

19793,Does Contact Tracing Work? Quasi-Experimental Evidence from an Excel Error in England,"Contact tracing has been a central pillar of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, contact tracing measures face substantive challenges in practice and well-identified evidence about their effectiveness remains scarce. This paper exploits quasi-random variation in COVID-19 contact tracing. Between September 25 and October 2, 2020, a total of 15,841 COVID-19 cases in England (around 15 to 20% of all cases) were not immediately referred to the contact tracing system due to a data processing error. Case information had been truncated from an Excel spreadsheet due to a row limit, which was discovered on October 3. There is substantial variation in the degree to which different parts of England areas were exposed - by chance - to delayed referrals of COVID-19 cases to to the contact tracing system. We show that more affected areas subsequently experienced a drastic rise in new COVID-19 infections and deaths alongside an increase in the positivity rate and the number of test performed, as well as a decline in the performance of the contact tracing system. Conservative estimates suggest that the failure of timely contact tracing due to the data glitch is associated with more than 125,000 additional infections and over 1,500 additional COVID-19-related deaths. Our findings provide strong quasi-experimental evidence for the effectiveness of contact tracing.","Fetzer, T.; Graeber, T.",2020-12-15,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.12.10.20247080,1,Thiemo Fetzer,University of Warwick,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.20247080v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.20247080v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,"NA"
27476,Alcov: Estimating Variant of Concern Abundance from SARS-CoV-2 Wastewater Sequencing Data,"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater is an important strategy for community level surveillance. Variants of concern (VOCs) can be detected in the wastewater samples using next generation sequencing, however it can be challenging to determine the relative abundance of different VOCs since the reads cannot be assembled into complete genomes. Here, we present Alcov (abundance learning of SARS-CoV-2 variants), a tool that uses mutation frequencies in SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data to predict the distribution of VOC lineages in the sample. We used Alcov to predict the distributions of lineages from three wastewater samples which agreed well with clinical data. By predicting not just which VOCs are present, but their relative abundances in the population, Alcov extracts a more complete snapshot of the variants which are circulating in a community.","Ellmen, I.; Lynch, M.

15337,"COVID-19 and human milk: SARS-CoV-2, antibodies, and neutralizing capacity","Background: It is not known whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from mother to infant during breastfeeding, and if so whether the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh this risk. This study was designed to evaluate 1) if SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in milk and on the breast of infected women, 2) concentrations of milk-borne anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and 3) the capacity of milk to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Methods: We collected 37 milk samples and 70 breast swabs (before and after breast washing) from 18 women recently diagnosed with COVID-19. Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-qPCR. Milk was also analyzed for IgA and IgG specific for the nucleocapsid protein, receptor binding domain (RBD), S2 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as 2 seasonal coronaviruses using ELISA; and for its ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Results: We did not detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in any milk sample. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on several breast swabs, although only one was considered conclusive. All milk contained SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG, and levels of anti-RBD IgA correlated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Strong correlations between levels of IgA and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses were noted. Conclusions: Our data do not support maternal-to-child transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via milk; however, risk of transmission via breast skin should be further evaluated. Importantly, milk produced by infected mothers is a source of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 activity. These results support recommendations to continue breastfeeding during mild-to-moderate maternal COVID-19 illness.","Pace, R. M.; Williams, J. E.; Järvinen, K. M.; Belfort, M. B.; Pace, C.

14239,Tocilizumab in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19 Pneumonia,"BACKGROUNDCOVID-19 is associated with immune dysregulation and hyperinflammation. Tocilizumab is an anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody.

METHODSPatients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia receiving standard care were randomized (2:1) to double-blinded intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg or placebo. The primary outcome measure was clinical status on a 7-category ordinal scale at day 28 (1, discharged/ready for discharge; 7, death).

RESULTSOverall, 452 patients were randomized; the modified-intention-to-treat population included 294 tocilizumab-treated and 144 placebo-treated patients. Clinical status at day 28 was not statistically significantly improved for tocilizumab versus placebo (P=0.36). Median (95% CI) ordinal scale values at day 28: 1.0 (1.0 to 1.0) for tocilizumab and 2.0 (1.0 to 4.0) for placebo (odds ratio, 1.19 [0.81 to 1.76]). There was no difference in mortality at day 28 between tocilizumab (19.7%) and placebo (19.4%) (difference, 0.3% [95% CI, -7.6 to 8.2]; nominal P=0.94). Median time to hospital discharge was 8 days shorter with tocilizumab than placebo (20.0 and 28.0, respectively; nominal P=0.037; hazard ratio 1.35 [95% CI 1.02 to 1.79]). Median duration of ICU stay was 5.8 days shorter with tocilizumab than placebo (9.8 and 15.5, respectively; nominal P=0.045). In the safety population, serious adverse events occurred in 34.9% of 295 patients in the tocilizumab arm and 38.5% of 143 in the placebo arm.

CONCLUSIONSIn this randomized placebo-controlled trial in hospitalized COVID-19 pneumonia patients, tocilizumab did not improve clinical status or mortality. Potential benefits in time to hospital discharge and duration of ICU stay are being investigated in ongoing clinical trials.

15299,"Heterogeneity and temporal variation in the management of COVID-19: a multinational drug utilization study including 71,921 hospitalized patients from China, South Korea, Spain, and the United States of America","ObjectivesA plethora of medicines have been repurposed or used as adjunctive therapies for COVID-19. We characterized the utilization of medicines as prescribed in routine practice amongst patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in South Korea, China, Spain, and the USA.

DesignInternational network cohort

SettingHospital electronic health records from Columbia University Irving Medical Centre (NYC, USA), Stanford (CA, USA), Tufts (MA, USA), Premier (USA), Optum EHR (USA), department of veterans affairs (USA), NFHCRD (Honghu, China) and HM Hospitals (Spain); and nationwide claims from HIRA (South Korea)

Participantspatients hospitalized for COVID-19 from January to June 2020

Main outcome measuresPrescription/dispensation of any medicine on or 30 days after hospital admission date

AnalysesNumber and percentage of users overall and over time

Results71,921 people were included: 304 from China, 2,089 from Spain, 7,599 from South Korea, and 61,929 from the USA. A total of 3,455 medicines were identified. Common repurposed medicines included hydroxychloroquine (<2% in NFHCRD to 85.4% in HM), azithromycin (4.9% in NFHCRD to 56.5% in HM), lopinavir/ritonavir (<3% in all US but 34.9% in HIRA and 56.5% in HM), and umifenovir (0% in all except 78.3% in NFHCRD). Adjunctive medicines were used with great variability, with the ten most used treatments being (in descending order): bemiparin, enoxaparin, heparin, ceftriaxone, aspirin, vitamin D, famotidine, vitamin C, dexamethasone, and metformin. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin increased rapidly in use in March-April but declined steeply in May-June.

ConclusionsMultiple medicines were used in the first months of COVID-19 pandemic, with substantial geographic and temporal variation. Hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, and umifenovir (in China only) were the most prescribed repurposed medicines. Antithrombotics, antibiotics, H2 receptor antagonists and corticosteroids were often used as adjunctive treatments. Research is needed on the comparative risk and benefit of these treatments in the management of COVID-19.

5547,FIRST DETECTION OF SARS-COV-2 IN UNTREATED WASTEWATERS IN ITALY,"Several studies have demonstrated the advantages of environmental surveillance through the monitoring of sewer systems for the assessment of viruses circulating in a given community (wastewater-based epidemiology, WBE).

During the COVID-19 public health emergency, many reports have described the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stools from COVID-19 patients, and a few studies reported the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters worldwide. Italy is among the worlds worst-affected countries in the COVID-19 pandemic, but so far there are no studies assessing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in Italian wastewaters. To this aim, twelve influent sewage samples, collected between February and April 2020 from Wastewater Treatment Plants in Milan and Rome, were tested adapting, for concentration, the standard WHO procedure for Poliovirus surveillance. Molecular analysis was undertaken with three nested protocols, including a newly designed SARS-CoV-2 specific primer set.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection occurred in volumes of 250 mL of wastewaters collected in both areas at high (Milan) and low (Rome) epidemic circulation, according to clinical data. Overall, 6 out of 12 samples were positive. One of the positive results was obtained in a Milan wastewater sample collected a few days after the first notified Italian case of autochthonous SARS-CoV-2.

The study shows that WBE has the potential to be applied to SARS-CoV-2 as a sensitive tool to study spatial and temporal trends of virus circulation in the population.","La Rosa, G.; Iaconelli, M.; Mancini, P.; Bonanno Ferraro, G.; Veneri, C.; Bonadonna, L.; Lucentini, L.; Suffredini, E.",2020-05-07,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.25.20079830,2,Giuseppina La Rosa,National Institute of Health,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079830v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079830v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139652
2516,Protocol for a randomized controlled trial testing inhaled nitric oxide therapy in spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19,"Introductionthe current worldwide outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is seriously threatening the public health. The number of infected patients is continuously increasing and the need for Intensive Care Unit admission ranges from 5 to 26%. The mortality is reported to be around 3.4% with higher values for the elderly and in patients with comorbidities. Moreover, this condition is challenging the healthcare system where the outbreak reached its highest value. To date there is still no available treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO) has a beneficial effect on the coronavirus-mediated acute respiratory syndrome, and this can be related to its viricidal effect. The time from the symptoms onset to the development of severe respiratory distress is relatively long. We hypothesize that high concentrations of inhaled NO administered during early phases of COVID-19 infection can prevent the progression of the disease.

Methods and analysisThis is a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Spontaneous breathing patients admitted to the hospital for symptomatic COVID-19 infection will be eligible to enter the study. Patients in the treatment group will receive inhaled NO at high doses (140-180 parts per million) for 30 minutes, 2 sessions every day for 14 days in addition to the hospital care. Patient in the control group will receive only hospital care. The primary outcome is the percentage of patients requiring endotracheal intubation due to the progression of the disease in the first 28 days from enrollment in the study. Secondary outcomes include mortality at 28 days, proportion of negative test for SARS-CoV-2 at 7 days and time to clinical recovery.

Ethics and disseminationThe trial protocol has been approved at the Investigation Review Boards of Xijing Hospital (Xian, China) and The Partners Human Research Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, USA) is pending. Recruitment is expected to start in March 2020. Results of this study will be published in scientific journals, presented at scientific meetings, and on related website or media in fighting this widespread contagious disease.

28123,"Inflection in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections missing the N501Y mutation as a marker of rapid Delta (B.1.617.2) lineage expansion in Ontario, Canada","BackgroundThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Delta lineage (B.1.617.2) was implicated in the SARS-CoV-2 surge in India. We sought to describe the rapid expansion of the Delta lineage in Ontario, Canada (population 15 million) using mutation profile information and confirmatory whole genome sequencing.

MethodsAll laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases reported to Public Health Ontario between April 1st and June 12th 2021, with cycle threshold values [&le;]35, were eligible for screening for the N501Y and the E484K mutations. We classified cases via mutation screening as: (1) N501Y-/E484K- (wild-type/Delta), (2) Alpha (N501Y+/E484K-), (3) Beta/Gamma (N501Y+/E484K+), or (4) N501Y-/E484K+ (predominantly B.1.525, and B.1.1.318).

ResultsThe N501Y-/E484K- mutation profile went from having a 29% transmission deficit relative to Alpha (relative Re = 0.71, 95%CI: 0.64, 0.77) on April 1st to having a 50% transmission advantage on June 12th (relative Re = 1.50, 95%CI: 1.31, 1.71). Whole genome sequencing of N501Y-/E484K-cases (N=583) confirmed that the pattern of increasing relative reproduction number coincided with the replacement of wild-type with Delta variant (from 2.2% in early April, to 83% in late May).

DiscussionDelta is rapidly overtaking other SARS-CoV-2 variants in Ontario, and has a substantial transmission advantage. An inflection in the proportion of cases missing the N501Y mutation from rapidly decreasing to rapidly increasing,3 may be an early warning signal for Delta lineage expansion.","Brown, K.

1902,Effective containment explains sub-exponential growth in confirmed cases of recent COVID-19 outbreak in Mainland China,"The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China is characterized by a distinctive algebraic, sub-exponential increase of confirmed cases with time during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate. Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents  = 2.1 {+/-} 0.3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population. These insights may aid the implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced COVID-19 secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.","Maier, B.

10009,Effect of hydroxychloroquine on SARS-CoV-2 viral load in patients with COVID-19,"BackgroundSome studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an effective drug in reducing the in vitro replication of SARS-CoV-2. However, the in vivo effect of HCQ still unclear. This study aims to evaluate viral load clearance in patients with COVID-19 who underwent HCQ treatment in comparison with a control group that did not receive the drug.

MethodsThis prospective study comprised consecutive viral load measurements in patients with COVID-19 hospitalized with a moderate illness. Patients received 400 mg of HCQ every 12 hours for 10 days according to the medical decision. Nasal swab samples were collected at the 1st, 7th, and 14th days of the admission.

Results155 samples were collected from 66 patients with COVID-19 (60% female), with a median age of 58 years. The viral load between studied groups, assumed as a semiquantitative measure of cycle threshold (Ct) values, presented no significant difference within the three consecutive measures ({Delta}Ct) (p>0.05). We also analyzed the {Delta}Ct viral load at different intervals of sample collection ({Delta}t <7; 7-12 and >12 days) without significant differences at any {Delta}Ct (p>0.05).

ConclusionIn this study, we did not observe any change in viral load in vivo with the use of HCQ.

SummaryWe evaluate viral load clearance in patients with COVID-19 who took hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for treatment and those who not. Prospective viral load measurements have shown any change in viral load in vivo with the use of HCQ.","Faico-Filho, K. S.; Conte, D. D.; Souza Luna, L. K.; Carvalho, J. M. A.; Perosa, A. H.

24081,Longitudinal assessment of diagnostic test performance over the course of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection,"What is already known about this topic?Diagnostic tests and sample types for SARS-CoV-2 vary in sensitivity across the infection period.

What is added by this report?We show that both RTqPCR (from nasal swab and saliva) and the Quidel SARS Sofia FIA rapid antigen tests peak in sensitivity during the period in which live virus can be detected in nasal swabs, but that the sensitivity of RTqPCR tests rises more rapidly in the pre-infectious period. We also use empirical data to estimate the sensitivities of RTqPCR and antigen tests as a function of testing frequency.

What are the implications for public health practice?RTqPCR tests will be more effective than rapid antigen tests at identifying infected individuals prior to or early during the infectious period and thus for minimizing forward transmission (provided results reporting is timely). All modalities, including rapid antigen tests, showed >94% sensitivity to detect infection if used at least twice per week. Regular surveillance/screening using rapid antigen tests 2-3 times per week can be an effective strategy to achieve high sensitivity (>95%) for identifying infected individuals.","Smith, R.

27454,Multisystemic cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in autopsies of COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundMultiorgan tropism of SARS-CoV-2 has previously been shown for several major organs.

MethodsWe have comprehensively analyzed 25 different formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues/organs from autopsies of fatal COVID-19 cases (n=8), using detailed histopathological assessment, detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using polymerase chain reaction and RNA in situ hybridization, viral protein using immunohistochemistry, and virus particles using transmission electron microscopy. Finally, we confirmed these findings in an independent external autopsy cohort (n=9).

FindingsSARS-CoV-2 RNA was mainly localized in epithelial cells, endothelial and mesenchymal cells across all organs. Next to lung, trachea, kidney, heart, or liver, viral RNA was also found in tonsils, salivary glands, oropharynx, thyroid, adrenal gland, testicles, prostate, ovaries, small bowel, lymph nodes, skin and skeletal muscle. Viral RNA was predominantly found in cells expressing ACE2, TMPRSS2, or both. The SARS-CoV-2 replicating RNA was also detected in these organs. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy were not suitable for reliable and specific SARS-CoV-2 detection in autopsies. The findings were validated using in situ hybridization on external COVID-19 autopsy samples. Finally, apart from the lung, correlation of virus detection and histopathological assessment did not reveal any specific alterations that could be attributed to SARS-CoV-2.

InterpretationSARS-CoV-2 could be observed in virtually all organs, colocalizing with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mainly in epithelial but also in mesenchymal and endothelial cells, and viral replication was found across all organ systems. Apart from the respiratory tract, no specific (histo-)morphologic alterations could be assigned to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSARS-CoV-2 has been shown to infect the respiratory tract and affect several other major organs. However, on a cellular level, the localization of SARS-CoV-2 and its targets ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have not been described comprehensively.

Added value of this studyWe have analyzed tissue SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-PCR and visualized its localization together with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 using in situ hybridization (ISH) in 25 different autopsy tissues. SARS-CoV-2 sense and antisense RNA were detected in 16 tissues/organs, mainly in epithelial cells and, to a lesser extent, in endothelial or stromal cells. Detection of viral protein using immunohistochemistry or viral particles using transmission electron microscopy did not yield specific results. Interestingly, apart from the respiratory tract and specifically the lungs, we have not found a specific pathology that would be associated with extrapulmonary viral spread.

Implications of all the available evidenceWe provide a recommendation on using these methods in autopsy diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2. Our data extend the current hypothesis of severe COVID-19 being multisystemic diseases. Our data also provide clear evidence of infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the endothelial cell across all organs, extending the hypothesis on the (micro)vascular involvement in COVID-19.","Wong, D.

20391,Staff to staff transmission as a driver of healthcare worker infections with COVID-19,"ObjectivesTo investigate the COVID-19 infections among staff at our institution and determine the interventions required to prevent subsequent staff infections.

DesignRetrospective cohort study

Participants and settingStaff working at a single tertiary referral hospital who returned a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 between 25 January 2020 and 25 November 2020.

Main outcome measuresSource of COVID-19 infection.

ResultsOf 45 staff who returned a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, 19 were determined to be acquired at Austin Health. Fifteen (15/19; 79% [95% CI: 54-94%]) of these were identified through contact tracing and testing following exposures to other infected staff and were presumed to be staff-staff transmission, including 10 healthcare workers (HCWs) linked to a single ward that cared for COVID-19 patients. Investigation of the outbreak identified the staff tearoom as the likely location for transmission, with subsequent reduction in HCW infections and resolution of the outbreak following implementation of enhanced control measures in tearoom facilities. No HCW contacts (0/204; 0% [95% CI: 0-2%]) developed COVID-19 infection following exposure to unrecognised patients with COVID-19.

ConclusionsUnrecognised infections among staff may be a significant driver of HCW infections in healthcare settings. Control measures should be implemented to prevent acquisition from other staff as well as patient-staff transmission.","Gordon, C. L.; Trubiano, J. A.; Holmes, N. E.; Chua, K.

22462,Treatment of irritant contact dermatitis in healthcare settings during the COVID19 pandemic: The emollient Dermol 500 exhibits virucidal activity against influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2.,"ObjectivesTo investigate whether the antimicrobial emollient Dermol 500 and its active components, benzalkonium chloride (BAK) and chlorhexidine dihydrochloride (CD), exhibit virucidal activity thus informing whether Dermol 500 is a suitable soap substitute for use during the COVID19 pandemic, to combat the increased incidence of work-related contact dermatitis in clinical settings that we report here.

MethodsInactivation of influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 by Dermol 500 and the independent and combined virucidal activity of the Dermol 500 components BAK and CD was assessed by influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity assays. Viruses were treated with concentrations of BAK and CD comparable to Dermol 500, and lower, and infectivity of the viruses assessed by titration.

ResultsDermol 500 exhibits comparable virucidal activity to alcohol-based sanitisers against influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the Dermol 500 components BAK and CD exhibit independent and synergistic virucidal activity against influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID19.

ConclusionsThe synergistic virucidal activity of the Dermol 500 components BAK and CD makes Dermol 500 suitable as a soap substitute to treat and prevent work-related contact dermatitis in healthcare settings.

22361,Associations between movement behaviors and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile,"BackgroundThere is limited evidence about emotional and behavioral responses in toddlers and preschoolers during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, particularly in Latin America.

ObjectiveTo assess associations between changes in movement behaviors (physical activity, screen time and sleeping) and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers during early stages of the pandemic in Chile.

MethodsA cross-sectional study conducted from March 30th to April 27th, 2020. Main caregivers of 1-to 5-year-old children living in Chile answered an online survey that included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, changes in the childs emotions and behaviors, movement behaviors and caregivers stress during the pandemic. Multiple linear regressions were used to assess the association between different factors and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers.

ResultsIn total, 1727 caregivers provided complete data on emotional changes for children aged 2.9{+/-}1.36 years old, 47.9% girls. A large proportion of toddlers and preschoolers in Chile experienced emotional and behavioral changes. Most caregivers reported that children were  more affectionate (78.9%),  more restless (65.1%), and  more frustrated (54.1%) compared with pre-pandemic times. Apart from changes in movement behaviors, factors such as child age, caregivers age and stress, and residential area (urban/rural) were consistently associated with changes in emotions and behaviors.

ConclusionThe pandemic substantially affected the emotions and behaviors of toddlers and preschoolers in Chile. Mental health promotion programs should consider multilevel approaches in which the promotion of movement behaviors and support for caregivers should be essential pieces for future responses.","Aguilar-Farias, N.; Toledo-Vargas, M.; Miranda-Marquez, S.; Cortinez-Oryan, A.; Martino-Fuentealba, P.; Cristi-Montero, C.; Rodriguez-Rodriguez, F.; Guarda-Saavedra, P.; Del Pozo Cruz, B.; Okely, A.

8010,Containing the Spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Meteorological Factors and Control Strategies,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally and the meteorological factors vary greatly across the world. Understanding the effect of meteorological factors and control strategies on COVID-19 transmission is critical to contain the epidemic. Using individual-level data in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore, and the number of confirmed cases in other regions, we explore the effect of temperature, relative humidity, and control measures on the spread of COVID-19. We found that high temperature mitigates the transmission of the disease. High relative humidity promotes COVID-19 transmission when temperature is low, but tends to reduce transmission when temperature is high. Implementing classical control measures can dramatically slow the spread of the disease. However, due to the occurrence of pre-symptomatic infections, the effect of the measures to shorten onset-to-isolation time is markedly reduced and the importance of contact tracing and quarantine and social distancing increases. The analytic results also highlight the importance of early intervention to contain the spread of COVID-19.","Lin, J.; Huang, W.; Wen, M.; Ma, S.; Hua, J.; Hu, H.; Li, D.; Yin, S.; Qian, Y.; Chen, P.; Zhang, Q.; Yuan, N.; Sun, S.",2020-05-26,Health Policy,10.1101/2020.05.23.20111468,1,Jun Lin,Xi\'an Jiaotong University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.23.20111468v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.23.20111468v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140935
17787,Profiling SARS-CoV-2 mutation fingerprints that range from the viral pangenome to individual infection quasispecies,"BackgroundThe genome of SARS-CoV-2 is susceptible to mutations during viral replication due to the errors generated by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. These mutations enable the SARS-CoV-2 to evolve into new strains. Viral quasispecies emerge from de novo mutations that occur in individual patients. In combination, these sets of viral mutations provide distinct genetic fingerprints that reveal the patterns of transmission and have utility in contract tracing.

MethodsLeveraging thousands of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we performed a viral pangenome analysis to identify conserved genomic sequences. We used a rapid and highly efficient computational approach that relies on k-mers, short tracts of sequence, instead of conventional sequence alignment. Using this method, we annotated viral mutation signatures that were associated with specific strains. Based on these highly conserved viral sequences, we developed a rapid and highly scalable targeted sequencing assay to identify mutations, detect quasispecies and identify mutation signatures from patients. These results were compared to the pangenome genetic fingerprints.

ResultsWe built a k-mer index for thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and identified conserved genomics regions and landscape of mutations across thousands of virus genomes. We delineated mutation profiles spanning common genetic fingerprints (the combination of mutations in a viral assembly) and rare ones that occur in only small fraction of patients. We developed a targeted sequencing assay by selecting primers from the conserved viral genome regions to flank frequent mutations. Using a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples, we identified genetic fingerprints consisting of strain-specific mutations seen across populations and de novo quasispecies mutations localized to individual infections. We compared the mutation profiles of viral samples undergoing analysis with the features of the pangenome.

ConclusionsWe conducted an analysis for viral mutation profiles that provide the basis of genetic fingerprints. Our study linked pangenome analysis with targeted deep sequenced SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples. We identified quasispecies mutations occurring within individual patients, mutations demarcating dominant species and the prevalence of mutation signatures, of which a significant number were relatively unique. Analysis of these genetic fingerprints may provide a way of conducting molecular contact tracing.","Lau, B. T.; Pavlichin, D.; Hooker, A. C.; Almeda, A. F.; Shin, G.; Chen, J.; Sahoo, M.

8005,No evidence for allelic association between Covid-19 and ACE2 genetic variants by direct exome sequencing in 99 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients,"BackgroundCoronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many animal species. Animal coronaviruses rarely infect humans with the exceptions of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and now SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Many studies suggested that genetic variants in ACE2 gene may influence the host susceptibility/resistance to SARS-CoV-2 virus according to the functional role of ACE2 in human pathophysiology. However, all these studies have been conducted in silico based on epidemiological and population data. We therefore investigated the occurrence of ACE2 variants in a cohort of 99 Italian unrelated individuals clinically diagnosed with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) to experimental demonstrate allelic association with disease severity.

MethodsBy whole-exome sequencing we analysed 99 DNA samples of severely and extremely severely COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the University Hospital of Rome """"Tor Vergata"""" and Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome.

ResultsWe identified three different germline variants, one intronic (c.439+4G>A) and two missense (c.2158A>G, p.Asn720Asp; c.1888G>C, p.Asp630His), in 26 patients with a similar frequency between male and female and a not statistically different frequency, except for c.1888G>C, (p.Asp630His) with the ethnically matched populations (EUR).

ConclusionsOur results suggest that there is not any ACE2 exonic allelic association with disease severity. It is possible that rare susceptibility alleles are located in the non-coding region of the gene able to control ACE2 gene activity. It is therefore of interest, to explore the existence of ACE2 susceptibility alleles to SARS-Co-V2 in these regulatory regions. In addition, we found no significant evidence that ACE2 alleles is associated with disease severity/sex bias in the Italian population.","Novelli, A.; Biancolella, M.; Borgiani, P.; Cocciadiferro, D.; Colona, V.

6709,"The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Minas Gerais, Brazil: insights from epidemiological data and SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing.","The recent emergence of a previously unknown coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), first confirmed in the city of Wuhan in China in December 2019, has caused serious public health and economic issues due to its rapid dissemination worldwide. Although 61,888 confirmed cases had been reported in Brazil by 28 April 2020, little was known about the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the country. To better understand the recent epidemic in the second most populous state in southeast Brazil (Minas Gerais, MG), we looked at existing epidemiological data from 3 states and sequenced 40 complete genomes from MG cases using Nanopore. We found evidence of multiple independent introductions from outside MG, both from genome analyses and the overly dispersed distribution of reported cases and deaths. Epidemiological estimates of the reproductive number using different data sources and theoretical assumptions all suggest a reduction in transmission potential since the first reported case, but potential for sustained transmission in the near future. The estimated date of introduction in Brazil was consistent with epidemiological data from the first case of a returning-traveler from Lombardy, Italy. These findings highlight the unique reality of MGs epidemic and reinforce the need for real-time and continued genomic surveillance strategies as a way of understanding and therefore preparing against the epidemic spread of emerging viral pathogens.","Xavier, J.; Giovanetti, M.; Adelino, T.; Fonseca, V.; Vitor Barbosa Da Costa, A.; Aparecida Ribeiro, A.; Nascimento Felicio, K.; Guerra Duarte, C.; Vinicius Ferreira Silva, M.; Salgado, A.; Teixeira Lima, M.; De Jesus, R.; Fabri, A.; Franco Soares Zoboli, C.; Gutemberg Souza Santos, T.; Iani, F.; Maria Bispo De Filippis, A.; Agudo Mendonca Teixeira De Siqueira, M.; Luiz De Abreu, A.; De Azevedo, V.; Brock Ramalho, D.; F.

19845,It makes you realise your own mortality: A qualitative study on mental health of older adults in the UK during COVID-19,"BackgroundOlder adults have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, with high fatalities and health complications reported. Adults over the age of 70 in the UK were advised to self-isolate for 3 months early during the pandemic and it is unclear which factors influenced their experiences during this time.

ObjectiveThe aim of this qualitative study was to explore factors that threatened and protected the wellbeing of older adults living in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsWe undertook semi-structured interviews with 20 adults aged over 70. Purposive sampling methods were used to increase diversity within the group. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsParticipants were aged 72-93, 9 women and 11 men, 80% were White British, 40% lived alone. We identified 2 superordinate themes, including (1) Threats to wellbeing: mortality concerns, grief and loss of normal life, restricted health service access, COVID-19 concerns, and restricted access to activities that protect wellbeing. (2) Factors protective of wellbeing: slower pace of life, maintaining routine, socialising, and use of past coping skills. Many participants drew on their resilience and life experience to self-manage fear and uncertainty associated with the pandemic, using their time during lockdown to reflect or organise end-of-life affairs.

ConclusionsThis study provides evidence that while older adults experienced challenges, many were resilient against COVID-19 restrictions despite early concerns of mental health consequences. Our findings highlight the importance of maintaining access to essentials to promote feelings of normality and social support to help reduce uncertainty in times of pandemics.","Mckinlay, A.

13742,A DEEP LEARNING MODEL TO PREDICT THE NEED FOR MECHANICAL VENTILATION USING CHEST X-RAY IMAGES IN HOSPITALIZED COVID-19 PATIENTS,"PurposeEarly identification of a potentially deteriorating clinical course in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is critical since there exists a resource-demand gap for the ventilators.

MaterialsWe aimed to develop and validate a deep learning-based approach to predict the need for mechanical ventilation as early as at the time of initial radiographic evaluation. We exploited the well-established DenseNet121 deep learning architecture for this purpose on 663 X-ray images derived from 528 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Two Pulmonary and Critical Care experts blindly and independently evaluated the same X-ray images for purpose of validation.

ResultsWe found that our deep learning model predicted the need for ventilation with a high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity (90.06%, 86.34% and 84.38%, respectively). This prediction was done approximately three days ahead of the actual intubation event. Our model also outperformed two Pulmonary and Critical Care experts who evaluated the same X-ray images and provided an incremental accuracy of 7.24-13.25%.

ConclusionOur deep learning model accurately predicted the need for mechanical ventilation early during hospitalization of COVID-19 patients. Until effective preventive or treatment measures become widely available for COVID-19 patients, prognostic stratification as provided by our model is likely to be highly valuable.","Kulkarni, A.

28327,Relating in vitro neutralisation level and protection in the CVnCoV (CUREVAC) trial.,"A recent study analysed the relationship between neutralising antibody response and protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection across eight vaccine platforms1. The efficacy results from a phase 2b/3 trial of a ninth vaccine candidate, CVnCoV (CUREVAC), was announced on 16 June 20212. The low efficacy of this new mRNA vaccine, which showed only 47% protection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, was surprising given the high efficacy of two previous mRNA-based vaccines3,4. A number of factors have been suggested to play a role in the low efficacy in the CVnCoV study, particularly around the dose and immunogenicity of the vaccine (which uses an unmodified mRNA construct5,6) and the potential role of infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants (which were the dominant strains observed in the CVnCoV trial)2.","Cromer, D.; Reynaldi, A.; Steain, M.; Triccas, J.

We provide, on the basis of these assumptions alone, a full derivation of mathematical formulas required for statistical analysis of testing data. In particular, we express the disease prevalence in a population through those for its homogeneous subpopulations. Although some of these formulas are routinely employed in prevalence studies, the study design often contravenes the assumptions upon which these formulas vitally depend. We also designed a natural prevalence estimator from the testing data and studied some of its properties.

3166,A COVID-19 Infection Risk Model for Frontline Health Care Workers,"The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, a set of risk assessment criteria is proposed to classify risks as  low,  moderate, or  high. We recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patients, e.g., less than 40 minutes for the whole day; (iii) increase the clean and safe space for social distancing, e.g., maximum of 10% crowd density, and if possible, implement compartmentalization of patients; and/or (iv) provide effective protective gears and facilities, e.g., 95% effective, that the frontline health care workers can use during their shift. Moreover, the formulated model can be used for other similar scenarios, such as identifying infection risk in public transportation, school classroom settings, offices, and mass gatherings.","Dy, L.

19876,"The impact of working during the Covid-19 pandemic on health care workers and first responders: mental health, function, and professional retention","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected front line health care workers (HCW) and first responders (FR). The infection risk from SARS CoV-2, the high mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the duration of the pandemic have created sustained and often traumatic stressors affecting HCW and FR.

ObjectivesTo assess the relationship of COVID-19 stressor frequency scores to psychiatric rating scale scores amongst HCW and FR. To determine if psychiatric rating scale scores mediate stressor effects on perceived work function and likelihood of remaining in current occupation.

DesignObservational, self-report in a convenience sample.

Participants118 HCW and FR caring for COVID-19 patients in the United States.

Main MeasureCOVID-19 related stressor frequencies were assessed using a 17-item questionnaire. Psychiatric symptoms were assessed with the PTSD Checklist 5 (PCL5), the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (for depression) (PHQ9), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD7).

Key ResultsStressor frequency scores correlated significantly with PCL5 scores (R=.57, p<1e-8), PHQ scores (R=.35, P<.001), ISI scores (R=.38, p<1e-4), and GAD7 scores (R=.39, p<.001), likelihood of staying in current occupation (R=-.39,p<1e-4), and trouble doing usual work (R=.33,p<.001). 51% of HCW and 44% of FR indicated decreased likelihood of staying in their current occupation. PCL5 scores substantially mediated the association between stress frequency scores and work function impairment.

ConclusionsThese results direct attention to recognizing potentially treatable psychiatric symptoms, particularly those of PTSD, in HCW and FR experiencing COVID-19 related stressors. They also suggest that mitigating COVID-19 related stressors when possible, such as by providing adequate personal protective equipment, can improve HCW and FR mental health, work function and retention in the health care work force.

4500,A Simple Method to Estimate Flow Restriction for Dual Ventilation of Dissimilar Patients: The BathRC Model,"With large numbers of COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation and ventilators being in short supply, in extremis two patients are having to share one ventilator. This possibility has been discussed for at least two decades, and careful matching of patient ventilation requirements is advised. However, with a large range of lung compliance and other characteristics, which may also vary with time, good matching is difficult to achieve. Adjusting the impedance of the flow path between ventilator and patient gives the opportunity to control the airway pressure and hence flow and volume individually for each patient. Several groups are now investigating this, in particular the addition of a flow restrictor in the inspiration tube for the patient who is more compliant, or requires a lower tidal volume. In this paper, we show that a simple linear resistance-compliance model, termed the BathRC model, of the ventilator tubing system and lung allows direct calculation of the relationships between pressures, volumes, and required flow restriction. The BathRC model is experimentally validated using a GE Aisys CS2 ventilator connected to two test lungs. The pressure-flow relationships for two restrictors are experimentally determined, and despite the need to approximate them with a linear resistance characteristic, their effect in the breathing circuit is accurately predicted by the simple model. The BathRC model is freely available for download; we do not condone dual ventilation, but this tool is provided to demonstrate that flow restriction can be readily estimated. This research is part of a larger test, simulation and design investigation on dual ventilation being undertaken at the UoB and RUH.","Plummer, A. R.; Du Bois, J. L.; Flynn, J.

18444,RT-LAMP assay for ultra-sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and VTM clinical samples,"The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the shortcomings in the deployment of state-of-the-art diagnostic platforms. Although several PCR-based techniques have been rapidly developed to meet the growing testing needs, such techniques often need samples collected through a swab, the use of RNA extraction kits, and expensive thermocyclers in order to successfully perform the test. Isothermal amplification-based approaches have also been recently demonstrated for rapid SARS-CoV-2 detection by minimizing sample preparation while also reducing the instrumentation and reaction complexity. There are limited reports of saliva as the sample source and some of these indicate inferior sensitivity when comparing RT-LAMP with PCR-based techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate an improved sensitivity assay to test saliva using a 2-step RT-LAMP assay, where a short 10-minute RT step is performed with only B3 and BIP primers before the final reaction. We show that while the 1-step RT-LAMP demonstrate satisfactory results, the optimized 2-step approach allows for single molecule sensitivity per reaction and performs significantly better than the 1-step RT-LAMP and conventional 2-step RT-LAMP approaches with all primers included in the RT Step. Importantly, we demonstrate RNA extraction-free RT-LAMP based assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from VTM and saliva clinical samples.","Ganguli, A.; Mostafa, A.; Berger, J.; Stewart De Ramirez, S.

5138,Performance of Fabrics for Home-Made Masks Against the Spread of Respiratory Infections Through Droplets: A Quantitative Mechanistic Study,"Respiratory infections may spread through droplets and aerosols released by infected individuals coughing, sneezing, or speaking. In the case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), spread can occur from symptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and asymptomatic persons. Given the limited supply of professional face masks and respirators, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended home-made cloth face coverings for use by the general public in areas of significant community-based transmission. There is, however, little information on the effectiveness of cloth face coverings in reducing droplet dissemination. Here, we ascertained the performance of 11 household fabrics at blocking high-velocity droplets, using a commercial medical mask as a benchmark. We also assessed their breathability (air permeability), texture, fiber composition, and water absorption properties. We found that droplet blocking efficiency anti-correlates with breathability; less breathable fabrics being more effective in blocking. However, materials with high breathability are desirable for comfort and to reduce airflow through gaps between the mask and face. Our measurements indicate that 2 or 3 layers of highly permeable fabric, such as T-shirt cloth, may block droplets with an efficacy similar to that of medical masks, while still maintaining comparable breathability. Overall, our study suggests that cloth face coverings, especially with multiple layers, may help reduce droplet transmission of respiratory infections. Furthermore, face coverings made from biodegradable fabrics such as cotton allow washing and reusing, and can help reduce the adverse environmental effects of widespread use of commercial disposable and non-biodegradable facemasks.","Aydin, O.; Emon, M.

19368,Development and optimization of a new method for direct extraction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from municipal wastewater using magnetic beads,"The use of magnetic beads in the extraction of nucleic acids from wastewater is presented as an approach to simplify extraction techniques for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral fragments in wastewater. In particular, this paper describes the development and optimization of a direct method for extracting SARS-CoV-2 RNA from municipal wastewater using magnetic beads. The recovery efficiency of the method using Accuplex SARS-CoV-2 Positive Reference Material (ASCV-2) was examined. Method factors assessed were sample volume, concentration of magnetic bead mix, elution temperature, and water matrix (deionized (DI) water and wastewater). The combination of optimized method parameters that resulted in the highest RNA recovery in both DI water (26.0 {+/-} 0.8%) and wastewater (11.8 {+/-} 1.4%) was a sample volume of 1.0 mL, a magnetic beads concentration of 100 {micro}L mL-1 sample, and an elution temperature of 60 {degrees}C. The performance of this optimized method was further assessed in recovery experiments using wastewater samples spiked at 1.8x106 and 1.8x104 gene copies L-1 (GU L-1) with Gamma Inactivated SARS-COV-2 (GI-SCV-2) and 1.0x106 and 1.0x104 infectious units L-1 of Human Coronavirus 229E (HCV 229E) as viral surrogates. Recoveries of 86.1 and 4.6% were achieved for wastewater samples spiked with GI-SCV-2 at low and high concentrations, respectively. In assessing the effects of wastewater pre-filtration and addition of DL-Dithiothreitol (DTT, used to inactivate RNases that may degrade RNA) on recovery efficiency of ASCV-2, the magnetic bead-based extraction protocol performed optimally with unfiltered wastewater without DTT (recovery = 17.4 {+/-} 0.4%). The method limit of detection (MLOD) for ASCV-2 recovered from pre-filtered wastewater was determined to be 4.6x104 GU L-1 (95% degree of confidence). Using this optimized magnetic bead-based extraction protocol, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was verified in wastewater collected from sewershed locations in Atlantic Canada. This emerging RNA extraction method is direct, rapid, and does not require the use of specialized equipment, thus offering advantageous application for laboratories with limited resources. As such, this method is an indispensable tool in the monitoring of wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 to potentially understand COVID-19 infection occurrence within communities and inform public health leaders.

Metagenomic analysis recovered whole genomes of the bacterium directly from samples, revealing the AMR genotype.

3267,In-host Modelling of COVID-19 Kinetics in Humans,"COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the impact of emergent pathogens as a major threat for human health. The development of quantitative approaches to advance comprehension of the current outbreak is urgently needed to tackle this severe disease. In this work, several mathematical models are proposed to represent SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in infected patients. Considering different starting times of infection, parameters sets that represent infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 are computed and compared with other viral infections that can also cause pandemics.

Based on the target cell model, SARS-CoV-2 infecting time between susceptible cells (mean of 30 days approximately) is much slower than those reported for Ebola (about 3 times slower) and influenza (60 times slower). The within-host reproductive number for SARS-CoV-2 is consistent to the values of influenza infection (1.7-5.35). The best model to fit the data was including immune responses, which suggest a slow cell response peaking between 5 to 10 days post onset of symptoms. The model with eclipse phase, time in a latent phase before becoming productively infected cells, was not supported. Interestingly, both, the target cell model and the model with immune responses, predict that virus may replicate very slowly in the first days after infection, and it could be below detection levels during the first 4 days post infection. A quantitative comprehension of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and the estimation of standard parameters of viral infections is the key contribution of this pioneering work.","Hernandez Vargas, E.

This study aimed to investigate the potential associations of obesity and diabetes with COVID-19 severe outcomes, assessed as ICU admittance.

SubjectsDemographic and patient characteristics from a retrospective cohort of 1158 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in a single center in Kuwait, along with their medical history, were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore the associations between different variables and ICU admittance.

ResultsFrom the 1158 hospitalized patients, 271 (23.4%) had diabetes, 236 (20.4%) had hypertension and 104 (9%) required admittance into the ICU. From patients with available measurements, 157 (21.6%) had body mass index (BMI)[&ge;]25 kg/m2. Univariate analysis showed that overweight (BMI=25.0-29.9 kg/m2), obesity class I (BMI=30-34.9 kg/m2) and morbid obesity (BMI[&ge;]40 kg/m2) associated with ICU admittance (odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence intervals (CI)]: 2.45 [1.26-4.74] p-value=0.008; OR [95% CI]: 3.51 [1.60-7.69] p-value=0.002; and OR [95% CI]: 5.18 [1.50-17.85] p-value=0.009], respectively). Patients with diabetes were more likely to be admitted to ICU (OR [95% CI]: 9.38 [5.49-16.02]). Two models for multivariate regression analysis were used, assessing either BMI or diabetes on ICU outcomes. In the BMI model, class I obesity and morbid obesity were associated with ICU admittance (adjusted OR (AOR) [95% CI]: 2.7 [1.17-6.20] p-value=0.019 and AOR [95% CI]: 3.95 [1.00-15.20] p-value=0.046, respectively). In the diabetes model, diabetes was associated with higher ICU admittance (AOR [95% CI]: 5.49 [3.13-9.65] p-value<0.001) whereas hypertension had a protective effect on ICU admittance (AOR [95% CI]: 0.51 (0.28-0.91).

ConclusionsIn our cohort, overweight, obesity and diabetes in patients with COVID-19 were associated with ICU admittance, putting these patients at higher risk of poor outcomes.","Al-Sabah, S.

22207,INCLUSIVE HEALTH: MODELING COVID-19 IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES AND COMMUNITIES,"Mass incarceration, commonly associated with overcrowding and inadequate health resources for incarcerated people, creates a fertile environment for the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in U.S. correctional facilities. The exact role that correctional facilities play in enhancing COVID-19 spread and enabling community re-emergence of COVID-19 is unknown. We constructed a novel stochastic model of COVID-19 transmission to estimate the impact of correctional facilities, specifically jails and state prisons, for enhancing disease transmission and enabling disease re-emergence in local communities. Using our model, we evaluated scenarios of testing and quarantining infected incarcerated people at 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0 times the rate that occurs for infected people in the local community for population sizes of 5, 10, and 20 thousand people. Our results illustrate testing and quarantining an incarcerated population of 800 would reduce the probability of a major community outbreak by 6% and also prevent between 250 to 730 incidences of COVID-19 per year, depending on local community size. These findings illustrate that managing COVID-19 in correctional facilities is essential to mitigate risks to community health, and thereby stresses the importance of improving the health standards of incarcerated people.","Greenhalgh, S.; Provencher, A.",2021-02-08,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.02.05.21251174,1,Scott Greenhalgh,Siena College,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.05.21251174v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.05.21251174v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,"NA"
15369,Identification of potential biomarkers and inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 infection,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has overwhelmed many health systems globally. Here, we aim to identify biological markers and associated biological processes of COVID-19 using a bioinformatics approach to elucidate their potential pathogenesis. The gene expression profile of the GSE152418 dataset was originally produced by using the high-throughput Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were applied to identify functional categories and biochemical pathways. KEGG and GO results suggested that biological pathways such as """"Cancer pathways"""" and """"Insulin pathways"""" were mostly affected in the development of COVID-19. Moreover, we identified several genes including EP300, CREBBP, and POLR2A were involved in the virus activities in COVID-19 patients. We further predicted that some inhibitors may have the potential to block the SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the L1000FWD analysis. Therefore, our study provides further insights into the underlying pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Gu, H.; Yuan, G.",2020-09-18,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.15.20195487,1,Gongsheng Yuan,"Department of Physiology and Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.15.20195487v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.15.20195487v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
22692,Statewide Impact of COVID-19 on Social Determinants of Health - A First Look: Findings from the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin,"There is an urgent need to track the early and ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on population health from local to global scales. At the same time, there is an overall lack of U.S. state-specific surveillance data tracking social determinants of health (SDOH) and associations with population well-being, individual mitigation and coping strategies, family dynamics and other economic shocks of the pandemic in populations. Statewide data can offer important insights into how SDOH shape the long-term effects of COVID-19 in the population since implementation of many policies and programs varied widely early on in the pandemic. In May of 2020, the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) program launched a statewide online/phone survey of early and ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on health and well-being across diverse communities and families. The goal of this study is to provide descriptive data including perceived COVID-19 risks, access to and results of COVID-19 antigen testing, individual mitigation and coping strategies, family dynamics and other economic shocks of the pandemic on health and mental health in populations. Key findings include higher rates of testing and perceived past infection from COVID-19 among non-white respondents. Higher economic shifts and job changes in female vs male respondents. Families with children reported overall higher levels of stress, and stress from the pandemic. There were urban and rural differences in changes to access to care. Rural regions, which had a lower prevalence of infections early in the pandemic as compared to urban areas, also reported fewer delays or missed appointments due to COVID-19. Key findings show that SDOH are shaping impacts of health and well-being early on in the pandemic and future longitudinal follow-up will be important to shape policies and programs well into the future.","Malecki, K.

2306,Optimal timing of one-shot interventions for epidemic control,"The apparent early success in Chinas large-scale intervention to control the COVID-19 epidemic has led to interest in whether other countries can replicate it as well as concerns about a resurgence of the epidemic if or when China relaxes the interventions. In this paper we look at the impact of a single short-term intervention on an epidemic. We see that if an intervention cannot be sustained long-term, it has the greatest impact if it is imposed once infection levels have become large enough that there is an appreciable number of infections present. For minimising the total number infected it should start close to the peak so that there is no rebound once the intervention is stopped, while to minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, allowing two peaks of comparable size rather than one very large peak. In populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each sub-population separately.

We do not attempt to clearly determine what makes an intervention sustainable or not. We believe that is a policy question. If an intervention is sustainable, it should be kept in place. Our intent is to offer insight into how best to time an intervention whose impact on society is too great to maintain.","Di Lauro, F.; Kiss, I.

22900,An integrated framework for building trustworthy data-driven epidemiological models: Application to the COVID-19 outbreak in New York City,"Epidemiological models can provide the dynamic evolution of a pandemic but they are based on many assumptions and parameters that have to be adjusted over the time when the pandemic lasts. However, often the available data are not sufficient to identify the model parameters and hence infer the unobserved dynamics. Here, we develop a general framework for building a trustworthy data-driven epidemiological model, consisting of a workflow that integrates data acquisition and event timeline, model development, identifiability analysis, sensitivity analysis, model calibration, model robustness analysis, and forecasting with uncertainties in different scenarios. In particular, we apply this framework to propose a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, including new compartments and model vaccination in order to forecast the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in New York City (NYC). We find that we can uniquely estimate the model parameters and accurately predict the daily new infection cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, in agreement with the available data from NYCs governments website. In addition, we employ the calibrated data-driven model to study the effects of vaccination and timing of reopening indoor dining in NYC.","Zhang, S.; Ponce, J.; Zhang, Z.; Lin, G.; Karniadakis, G.

5264,"Knowledge, attitude, practice and perception regarding COVID-19 among students in Bangladesh: Survey in Rajshahi University","BackgroundThe number of infection and death by COVID-19 has been rapidly increasing since December 2019 in all over the world. Until now, there is no specific treatment or vaccine for this disease; WHO suggests only some protective measures like maintaining social distance, staying home, washing hands with soap or sanitizer, wearing mask etc. The objective of this study was to survey knowledge, attitude, practice and perception regarding COVID-19 among students in Rajshahi University, Bangladesh.

MethodsWe collected data from 305 students of Rajshahi University for this cross-sectional study using mixed sampling from March 11 to March 19, 2020. Frequency distribution, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used in this study.

ResultsOut of 305 participants, 224 (73.4%) and 81 (26.6%) were male and female students respectively. The study revealed that Rajshahi university students had average knowledge on symptoms, protective way and transmission of COVID-19. Female students were more knowledgeable than male. More than one third of the students had negative attitude to avoiding public transport and going out to public places with friends and family. The practice of students practice during our data collection period and in future was not satisfactory. More than one third of students were not keen to stay at home and avoid going to crowded places. The perception towards COVID-19 was not good; they had no idea whether the outbreak would affect their daily routine, study and financial matters, study field work and restrict leisure time of meeting family and relatives.

ConclusionsWe found that general knowledge, attitude, practice and perception of the university students regarding COVID-19 were not satisfactory. This indicated that the situation was worse among common people. In Bangladesh, the number of healthcare providers is insufficient. University students can be employed as potential workforce to create awareness among mass people on prevention of COVID-19.","Wadood, M. A.; Mamun, A.; Rafi, M. A.; Islam, M.

27323,Cross-reactive antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination,"Current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are losing efficacy against emerging variants and may not protect against future novel coronavirus outbreaks, emphasizing the need for more broadly protective vaccines. To inform the development of a pan-coronavirus vaccine, we investigated the presence and specificity of cross-reactive antibodies against the spike (S) proteins of human coronaviruses (hCoV) after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. We found an 11 to 123-fold increase in antibodies binding to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as a 2 to 4-fold difference in antibodies binding to seasonal hCoVs in COVID-19 convalescent sera compared to pre-pandemic healthy donors, with the S2 subdomain of the S protein being the main target for cross-reactivity. In addition, we detected cross-reactive antibodies to all hCoV S proteins after SARS-CoV-2 S protein immunization in macaques, with higher responses for hCoV more closely related to SARS-CoV-2. These findings support the feasibility of and provide guidance for development of a pan-coronavirus vaccine.","Grobben, M.; Van Der Straten, K.; Brouwer, P. J.

13193,Quantifying threat from COVID-19 infection hazard in Primary Schools in England,"We have constructed a COVID-19 infection hazard model for the return of pupils to the 16,769 state Primary Schools in England that takes into account uncertainties in model input parameters. The basic probabilistic model estimates likely number of primary schools with one or more infected persons under three different return-to-school circumstances. Inputs to the infection hazard model are: the inventory of children, teachers and support staff; the prevalence of COVID-19 in the general community including its spatial variation, and the ratio of adult susceptibility to that of children. Three scenarios of inventory are: the counts on 1st June when schools re-opened to Nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 children, when approximately one-third of eligible children attended; a scenario assuming a full return of eligible children in those cohorts; and a return of all primary age children, scheduled for September. With a national average prevalence, we find that for the first scenario between 178 and 924 schools out of 16,769 in total (i.e. about 1% and 5.5% respectively) may have infected individuals present, expressed as a 90% credible interval. For the second scenario, the range is between 336 (2%) and 1873 (11%) schools with one (or more) infected persons, while for the third scenario the range is 661 (4%) to 3310 (20%) schools, assuming that the prevalence is the same as it was on 5th June. The range decreases to between 381 (2%) and 900 (5%) schools with an infected person if prevalence is one-quarter that of 5th June, and increases to between 2131 (13%) and 9743 (58%) schools for the situation where prevalence increases to 4 times the 5th June level. Net prevalence of COVID-19 in schools is reduced relative to the general community because of the lower susceptibility of primary age children to infection. When regional variations in prevalence and school size distribution are taken into account there is a slight decrease in number of infected schools, but the uncertainty on these projected numbers increases markedly. The probability of having an infected school in a community is proportional to the local prevalence and school size. Analysis of a scenario equivalent to a full return to school with an average national prevalence of 1 in 1700 and spatial prevalence variations, estimated from data for late June, indicates 82% of infected schools would be located in areas where prevalence exceeds the national average. The probability of having multiple infected persons in a school increases markedly in high prevalence areas. Assuming national prevalence characteristic of early June, individual, operational and societal risk will increase if schools reopen fully in September due to both increases in numbers of children and the increased challenges of sustaining mitigation measures. Comparison between incidents in primary schools with positive tests in June and July and our estimates of number of infected schools indicates at least an order of magnitude difference. The much lower number of incidents reflects several factors, including effective reduction in transmission resulting from risk mitigation measure instigated by schools.","Sparks, S. R.; Aspinall, W.

Limited evidence is available concerning breastfeeding in women with COVID-19.

MethodsTwenty-three pregnant women and puerperae were enrolled in the study. To evaluate the effect of breastfeeding on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the presence of SARS-CoV-2, IgG and IgM in breast milk, maternal blood and infant blood were assessed. Feeding patterns were also recorded in follow-up.

ResultsNo positive detection for SARS-CoV-2 of neonates was found. All breast milk samples were negative for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The presence of IgM of SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk was correlated with maternal blood. The results of IgG detection for SARS-CoV-2 were negative in all breast milk samples. All the infants were in healthy condition while six of them were fed with whole or partial breast milk. Eight infants received antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 in one month after birth and the results were all negative.

ConclusionFindings from this small number of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for mother-to-child transmission via breast feeding in women with COVID-19 in the third trimester and puerperium.","Luo, Q.; Chen, L.; Yao, D.; Zhu, J.; Zeng, X.; Xia, L.; Wu, M.; Lin, L.; Jin, Z.; Zhang, Q.; Feng, D.; Yu, S.; Song, B.; Zhang, W.; Wang, H.; Zhang, Y.; Su, Z.; Luo, M.; Jiang, X.; Chen, H.",2020-06-01,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.30.20033407,1,Hui Chen,"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.30.20033407v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.30.20033407v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"

While essential activities remained consistent over time, more individuals attended gatherings of 10 or more people as cases rose, particularly in the 18-29 age group. A majority of individuals wore masks. It appears necessary to continue limiting gatherings and encourage mask-wearing, particularly among younger groups.","Sheehan, M. M.; Pfoh, E.

17105,Survey of Attitudes on Personal Protection Interventions Against COVID-19 Including MMR Vaccination and Future Anti-COVID Vaccines,"An electronic survey was conducted in October, 2020 among individuals primarily age 60 and older regarding their degree of confidence of deriving personal protection from 8 different anti-COVID interventions - social isolation, lockdowns, avoiding restaurants, taking MMR vaccine, wearing masks when indoors with others, avoiding hotels, avoiding commercial air travel, and using the first future specific anti-COVID vaccine. Responses were received from 135 persons from many different U.S. regions and 5 foreign countries. Respondents were generally individuals with very high levels of education and personal achievement. Results demonstrated wide diversity of responses regarding each of these interventions. None were strongly supported by a majority of respondents, but those receiving the largest proportions of strong support were social isolation (41%), wearing masks indoors (41%), and using the first anti-COVID vaccine (41%). MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccination was viewed much more positively than negatively but had the highest proportion of individuals who felt they had insufficient data to formulate an opinion. The largest number of strong negative assessments were toward lockdowns (37%). We speculate that the wide variation in perception of possible benefits from the surveyed interventions, most of which have been widely practiced by or imposed upon millions of individuals, in this highly accomplished older population at increased personal risk from COVID-19 reflects the current absence of rigorous scientific proof of the efficacy of any these interventions, and the continuation of the epidemic despite the widespread utilization of most of them.","Schulman, J.

23288,Impact of COVID-19 pre-test probability on positive predictive value of high cycle threshold SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription PCR test results,"BackgroundPerformance characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection assays are understudied within contexts of low pre-test probability, including screening asymptomatic persons without epidemiological links to confirmed cases, or asymptomatic surveillance testing. SARS-CoV-2 detection without symptoms may represent resolved infection with persistent RNA shedding, presymptomatic or asymptomatic infection, or a false positive test. This study assessed clinical specificity of SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays by retesting positive specimens from five pre-test probability groups ranging from high to low with an alternate assay.

Materials and MethodsA total of 122 rRT-PCR positive specimens collected from unique patients between March and July 2020 were retested using a laboratory-developed nested RT-PCR assay targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene followed by Sanger sequencing.

ResultsSignificantly less positive results in the lowest pre-test probability group (facilities with institution-wide screening having [&le;] 3 positive asymptomatic cases) were reproduced with the nested RdRp gene RT-PCR assay than in all other groups combined (5/32, 15{middle dot}6% vs 61/90, 68%; p <0{middle dot}0001), and in each subgroup with higher pre-test probability (individual subgroup range 50{middle dot}0% to 85{middle dot}0%).

ConclusionsA higher proportion of false-positive test results are likely with lower pre-test probability. Positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results should be interpreted within the context of patient history, clinical setting, known exposure, and estimated community disease prevalence. Large-scale SARS-CoV-2 screening testing initiatives among low pre-test probability populations should be evaluated thoroughly prior to implementation given the risk of false positives and consequent potential for harm at the individual and population level.","Gubbay, J.

11277,Clinical Features of Hemodialysis (HD) patients confirmed with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): a Retrospective Case-Control Study,"BackgroundSince December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) occurred in wuhan, China, and outbreaked rapidly into a global pandemic. This current poses great challenges to hemodialysis (HD) patients.

ObjectiveTo make a comprehensive evaluation and comparison between HD patients confirmed with COVID-19 and the general HD patients.

MethodsHD patients confirmed with COVID-19 in Wuhan No.5 Hospital were admitted as confirmed group from Jan 10 to Mar 15, 2020. And HD patients not infected in our dialysis center were chosen as control group. General characteristics, laboratory indicators were retrospectively collected, analyzed and compared.

ResultsA total of 142 cases were admitted, including 43 cases in confirmed group and 99 in control group. Body mass index (BMI) was slightly lower in confirmed group than that in control group (P=0.011). The proportion of one or less underlying disease in confirmed group(51.16%) was higher than that in control group(14.14%)(P< 0.001), and the proportion of three or more underlying diseases in confirmed group(11.63%) was lower than that in control group(52.53%)(P< 0.001). Patients in confirmed group exhibited significantly lower hemoglobin, lymphocyte count, and lymphocyte percentage, but higher neutrophil percentage, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein, aspartate transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase. There was no significant difference in age, gender, dialysis age, primary disease, the using of ACEI/ARB, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and other indicators between the two groups.

ConclusionsFaced with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), HD patients with lower BMI and hemoglobin were more susceptible to be infected, which might be related to malnutrition. Once confirmed with COVID-19, HD patients expressed obviously dis-regulated of inflammation and immune.","Wang, X.; Zhou, H.; Xiao, X.; Tan, X.; Zhang, X.; He, Y.; Li, J.; Yang, G.; Li, M.; Liu, D.; Han, S.; Kuang, H.",2020-07-10,Nephrology,10.1101/2020.07.06.20147827,1,Xiaohui Wang,"Department of Nephrology, Wuhan No.5 Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430050, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147827v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147827v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
22547,Epidemiology of COVID-19 infection amongst workers in Primary Healthcare in Qatar,"BackgroundCOVID-19 transmission was significant amongst Healthcare workers worldwide.

AimThis study aims to estimate the risk of exposure for COVID-19 across Primary Healthcare workers in the State of Qatar. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted to study the burden of COVID-19 among staff working at PHCC during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 1 to October 31, 2020.

Results1,048 (87.4%)of the infected HCWs belonged to the age group below 45 years, and 488 (40.7%) HCWs were females. 450 (37.5%) were HCWs clinical staff working in one of the 27 PHCC HCs; Despite the increased patient footfall and risk environment, the COVID HCs had an attack rate of 10.1%, which is not significantly different from the average attack rate of 8.9% among staff located in other HCs (p-value =0.26). Storekeepers, engineering & maintenance staff, housekeeping staff, support staff, and security staff (outsourced positions) had the highest positivity rates, 100%, 67.2%, 47.1%, 32.4%, and 29.5% respective positivity rates.

ConclusionsThe elevated risk of infection amongst outsourced healthcare workers can be explained by environmental factors such as living conditions. On the other hand, better containment within clinical healthcare workers can be attributed to strict safety training and compliance with preventative measures which is recommended to be implemented across all settings.","Al Kuwari, M.; Abdelmalik, M.; Al Nuaimi, A.; Abdelmajeed, J.; Romaihi, H.; Semaan, S.",2021-02-18,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.02.15.21251586,1,Sandy Semaan,Primary Healthcare Corporation,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.15.21251586v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.15.21251586v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
23150,Introductions and evolutions of SARS-CoV-2 strains in Japan,"COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in Japan on January 15th, 2020, soon after the pandemic originated in Wuhan, China. Subsequently, Japan experienced three distinct waves of the outbreak in the span of a year and has been attributed to new exogenous strains and evolving existing strains. Japan engaged very early on in tracking different COVID-19 sub-strains and have sequenced approximately 5% of all confirmed cases. While Japan has enforced stringent airport surveillance on cross-border travelers and returnees, some carriers appear to have advanced through the quarantine stations undetected. In this study, 17112 genomes sampled in Japan were analyzed to understand the strains, heterogeneity and temporal evolution of different SARS-CoV-2 strains. We identified 11 discrete strains with a substantial number of cases with most strains possessing the spike (S) D614G and nucleocapsid (N) 203_204delinsKR mutations. Besides these variants, ORF1ab P3371S, A4815V, S1361P, and N P151L were also detected in nearly half the samples constituting the most common strain in Japan. 115 distinct strains have been introduced into Japan and 12 of them were introduced after strict quarantine policy was implemented. In particular, the B.1.1.7 strain, that emerged in the United Kingdom (UK) in September 2020, has been circulating in Japan since late 2020 after eluding cross-border quarantine stations. Similarly, the B.1.351 strain dubbed the South African variant, P.1 Brazilian strain and R.1 strain with the spike E484K mutation have been detected in Japan. At least four exogenous B.1.1.7 sub-strains have been independently introduced in Japan as of late January 2021, and these strains carry mutations that give selective advantage including N501Y, H69_V70del, and E484K that confer increased transmissibility, reduced efficacy to vaccines and possible increased virulence. It is imperative that the quarantine policy be revised, cross-border surveillance reinforced, and new public health measures implemented to mitigate further transmission of this deadly disease and to identify strains that may engender resistance to vaccines.","Tokumasu, R.; Weeraratne, D.; Snowdon, J.; Parida, L.; Kudo, M.; Koyama, T.",2021-05-14,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.02.26.21252555,2,Takahiko Koyama,IBM TJ Watson Research Center,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.26.21252555v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.26.21252555v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,"NA"
15165,Containment to outbreak tipping points in COVID-19,"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been a cornerstone in managing emergent diseases such as COVID-191-4. However, despite their potential to contain or attenuate the epidemic, the effects of NPIs on disease dynamics are not well understood1,5-7. We show that saturation of NPIs with the increase in infected individuals, an expected consequence of limited contact tracing and healthcare capacities, produces a positive feedback in the disease growth rate and a threshold between two alternative states--containment and outbreak8. These alternative states were previously related with the strength of NPIs but not with the infection number2,9-11. Furthermore, the transition between these states involves an abrupt acceleration in disease dynamics, which we report here for several COVID-19 outbreaks around the world. The consequences of a positive feedback in population dynamics at low numbers is a phenomenon widely studied in ecology--the Allee effect. This effect is a determinant of extinction-outbreak states, geographic synchronization, spatial spread, and the effect of exogenous variables, as vaccination12-15. As countries are relaxing containing measures, recognizing an NPI-induced Allee effect may be essential for deploying containment strategies within and among countries16 and acknowledges the need for early warning indicators of approaching epidemic tipping points17.","Arim, M.; Herrera-Esposito, D.; Bermolen, P.; Cabana, A.; Fariello, M.

24091,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical procedures in Brazil: a descriptive study,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has deeply affected medical practice, and changes in healthcare activities were needed to minimize the overload and avoid healthcare systems collapse. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on surgical procedures in Brazil.

Materials and MethodsWe conducted a descriptive study of the number of hospitalizations for surgical procedures in Brazil from 2016 to 2020. Data were collected from the Brazilian Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System (DATASUS). Analyzes were performed according to the type of procedure, geographical region, subgroups of surgical procedures, and the number of surgeries from 2020 were compared with the average from 2016 to 2019.

ResultsThere were 4,009,116 hospitalizations for surgical procedures in the Brazilian Public Health System in 2020. When comparing it to the average of hospitalizations from 2016-2019, there was a decrease of 14.88% [95%IC (14.82-14.93)]. Decrease rates were 34.82% [95%IC (34.73-34.90)] for elective procedures and 1.11% [95%IC (1.07-1.13)] for urgent procedures. Decrease rates were similar in all the five regions of the country (average 14.17%). Surgical procedure subgroups with the highest decrease rates were endocrine gland surgery (48.03%), breast surgery (40.68%), oral and maxillofacial surgery (37.03%), surgery of the upper airways, face, head and neck (36.06%), and minor surgeries and surgeries of skin, subcutaneous tissue and mucosa (33.16%). Conclusion: The overload of healthcare facilities has demanded a reduction of non-urgent activities to prevent a collapse of healthcare systems, resulting in a decrease in elective surgeries. Recommendations about the performance of surgical procedures were made, and continuous refinements of these recommendations are encouraged.","Luizeti, B. O.; Perli, V. A.

8094,"High-throughput immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2, considerable differences in performance when comparing three methods","BackgroundThe recently launched high-throughput assays for the detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may change the managing strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed at investigating the performance of three high-throughput assays and one rapid lateral flow test relative to the recommended criteria defined by regulatory authorities.

MethodsA total of 133 samples, including 100 pre-pandemic samples, 20 samples from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive individuals, and 13 potentially cross-reactive samples were analysed with SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Abbott), Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche), LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG (DiaSorin) and 2019-nCOV IgG/IgM Rapid Test (Dynamiker Biotechnology Co).

ResultsAll assays performed with a high level of specificity; however, only Abbott reached 100% (95% CI 96.3-100). The pre-pandemic samples analysed with Roche, DiaSorin and Dynamiker Biotechnology resulted in two to three false-positive results per method (specificity 96.9-98.0%). Sensitivity differed more between the assays, Roche exhibiting the highest sensitivity (100%, CI 83.9-100). The corresponding figures for Abbott, DiaSorin and Dynamiker Biotechnology were 85.0%, 77.8% and 75.0%, respectively.

ConclusionsThe results of the evaluated SARS-CoV-2 assays vary considerably as well as their ability to fulfil the performance criteria proposed by regulatory authorities. Introduction into clinical use in low-prevalent settings, should therefore, be made with caution.","Ekelund, O.; Ekblom, K.; Somajo, S.; Pattison-Granberg, J.; Olsson, K.; Petersson, A.",2020-09-17,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.22.20106294,2,Annika Petersson,"Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Vaxjo Central Hospital, Vaxjo, Sweden",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.20106294v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.20106294v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1080/23744235.2021.1931434
22797,SARS-CoV-2 disinfection in aqueous solution by UV222 from a krypton chlorine excilamp,"There is an urgent need for evidence-based development and implementation of engineering controls to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. Ultraviolet (UV) light can inactivate coronaviruses, but the practicality of UV light as an engineering control in public spaces is limited by the hazardous nature of conventional UV lamps, which are Mercury (Hg)-based and emit a peak wavelength (254 nm) that penetrates human skin and is carcinogenic. Recent advances in the development and production of Krypton Chlorine (KrCl) excimer lamps hold promise in this regard, as these emit a shorter peak wavelength (222 nm) and are recently being produced to filter out emission above 240 nm. However, the disinfection kinetics of KrCl UV excimer lamps against SARS-CoV-2 are unknown. Here we provide the first dose response report for SARS-CoV-2 exposed to a commercial filtered KrCl excimer light source emitting primarily 222 nm UV light (UV222), using multiple assays of SARS-CoV-2 viability. Plaque infectivity assays demonstrate the pseudo-first order rate constant of SARS-CoV-2 reduction of infectivity to host cells to be 0.64 cm2/mJ (R2 = 0.95), which equates to a D90 (dose for 1 log10 or 90% inactivation) of 1.6 mJ/cm2. Through RT-qPCR assays targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene with a short (<100 bp) and long ([~]1000 bp) amplicon in samples immediately after UV222 exposure, the reduction of ability to amplify indicated an approximately 10% contribution of N gene damage to disinfection kinetics. Through ELISA assay targeting the N protein in samples immediately after UV222 exposure, we found no dose response of the ability to damage the N protein. In both qPCR assays and the ELISA assay of viral outgrowth supernatants collected 3 days after incubation of untreated and UV222 treated SARS-CoV-2, molecular damage rate constants were similar, but lower than disinfection rate constants. These data provide quantitative evidence for UV222 doses required to disinfect SARS-CoV-2 in aqueous solution that can be used to develop further understanding of disinfection in air, and to inform decisions about implementing UV222 for preventing transmission of COVID19.

16976,Extending the range of COVID-19 risk factors ina Bayesian network model for personalised riskassessment,"A need is emerging for individuals to gauge their own risks of coronavirus infection as it becomes apparent that contact tracing to contain the spread of the virus is not working in many societies. This paper presents an extension of an existing Bayesian network model for an application in which people can add their own personal risk factors to calculate their probability of exposure to the virus and likely severity if they do catch the illness. The data need not be shared with any central authority. In this way, people can become more aware of their individual risks and adjust their behaviour accordingly, as many countries prepare for a second wave of infections or a prolonged pandemic. This has the advantage not only of preserving privacy but also of containing the virus more effectively by allowing users to act without the time lag of waiting to be informed that a contact has been tested and confirmed COVID-19 positive. Through a nuanced assessment of individual risk, it could also release many people from isolation who are judged highly vulnerable using cruder measures, helping to boost economic activity and decrease social isolation without unduly increasing transmission risk. Although much has been written and reported about single risk factors, little has been done to bring these factors together in a user-friendly way to give an overall risk rating. The causal probabilistic model presented here shows the power of Bayesian networks to represent the interplay of multiple, dependent variables and to predict outcomes. The network, designed for use in the UK, is built using detailed data from government and health authorities and the latest research, and is capable of dynamic updates as new information becomes available. The focus of the paper is on the extended set of risk factors.","Prodhan, G.",2020-10-21,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.10.20.20215814,1,Georgina Prodhan,"Queen Mary, University of London",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.20.20215814v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.20.20215814v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
12736,"COVID-19 Pandemic Severity, Lockdown Regimes, and People Mobility: Evidence from 88 Countries","This study empirically investigates the complex interplay between the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, mobility changes in retail and recreation, transit stations, workplaces, and residential areas, and lockdown measures in 88 countries of the word. To conduct the study, data on mobility patterns, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of people, lockdown measures, and coronavirus pandemic were collected from multiple sources (e.g., Google, UNDP, UN, BBC, Oxford University, Worldometer). A Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique is used to investigate the direct and indirect effects of independent variables on dependent variables considering the intervening effects of mediators. Results show that lockdown measures have significant effects to encourage people to maintain social distancing. However, pandemic severity and socioeconomic and institutional factors have limited effects to sustain social distancing practice. The results also explain that socioeconomic and institutional factors of urbanity and modernity have significant effects on pandemic severity. Countries with a higher number of elderly people, employment in the service sector, and higher globalization trend are the worst victims of the coronavirus pandemic (e.g., USA, UK, Italy, and Spain). Social distancing measures are reasonably effective at tempering the severity of the pandemic.","Rahman, M. M.; Thill, J.-C.; Paul, K.

27757,Brain imaging before and after COVID-19 in UK Biobank,"There is strong evidence for brain-related pathologies in COVID-19, some of which could be a consequence of viral neurotropism. The vast majority of brain imaging studies so far have focused on qualitative, gross pathology of moderate to severe cases, often carried out on hospitalised patients. It remains unknown however whether the impact of COVID-19 can be detected in milder cases, in a quantitative and automated manner, and whether this can reveal a possible mechanism for the spread of the disease. UK Biobank scanned over 40,000 participants before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, making it possible to invite back in 2021 hundreds of previously-imaged participants for a second imaging visit. Here, we studied the effects of the disease in the brain using multimodal data from 782 participants from the UK Biobank COVID-19 re-imaging study, with 394 participants having tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection between their two scans. We used structural and functional brain scans from before and after infection, to compare longitudinal brain changes between these 394 COVID-19 patients and 388 controls who were matched for age, sex, ethnicity and interval between scans. We identified significant effects of COVID-19 in the brain with a loss of grey matter in the left parahippocampal gyrus, the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the left insula. When looking over the entire cortical surface, these results extended to the anterior cingulate cortex, supramarginal gyrus and temporal pole. We further compared COVID-19 patients who had been hospitalised (n=15) with those who had not (n=379), and while results were not significant, we found comparatively similar findings to the COVID-19 vs control group comparison, with, in addition, a greater loss of grey matter in the cingulate cortex, central nucleus of the amygdala and hippocampal cornu ammonis (all |Z|>3). Our findings thus consistently relate to loss of grey matter in limbic cortical areas directly linked to the primary olfactory and gustatory system. Unlike in post hoc disease studies, the availability of pre-infection imaging data helps avoid the danger of pre-existing risk factors or clinical conditions being mis-interpreted as disease effects. Since a possible entry point of the virus to the central nervous system might be via the olfactory mucosa and the olfactory bulb, these brain imaging results might be the in vivo hallmark of the spread of the disease (or the virus itself) via olfactory and gustatory pathways.","Douaud, G.; Lee, S.; Alfaro-Almagro, F.; Arthofer, C.; Wang, C.; Lange, F.; Andersson, J.

5252,Lack of association between genetic variants at ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection and human quantitative phenotypes,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shows a wide variation in expression and severity of symptoms, from very mild or no symptomes, to flu-like symptoms, and in more severe cases, to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and even death. Large differences in outcome have also been observed between males and females. The causes for this variability are likely to be multifactorial, and to include genetics. The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the infection uses the human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell invasion, and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. Genetic variation in these two genes may thus modulate an individuals genetic predisposition to infection and virus clearance. While genetic data on COVID-19 patients is being gathered, we carried out a phenome-wide association scan (PheWAS) to investigate the role of these genes in other human phenotypes in the general population. We examined 178 quantitative phenotypes including cytokines and cardio-metabolic biomarkers, as well as 58 medications in 36,339 volunteers from the Lifelines population biobank, in relation to 1,273 genetic variants located in or near ACE2 and TMPRSS2. While none reached our threshold for significance, we observed a suggestive association of polymorphisms within the ACE2 gene with (1) the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) combination therapies (p=5.7x10-4), an association that is significantly stronger in females (pdiff=0.01), and (2) with the use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products (p=5.5x10-4). While these associations need to be confirmed in larger sample sizes, they suggest that these variants play a role in diseases such as hypertension and chronic inflammation that are often observed in the more severe COVID-19 cases. Further investigation of these genetic variants in the context of COVID-19 is thus promising for better understanding of disease variability.

27125,"Fear, Anxiety, Stress, and Depression of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic among patients and their healthcare workers","BackgroundDisease pandemics are known to cause psychological distress. The ensuing mental health issues are not only restricted to the patients and their relatives/friends but affect the healthcare workers (HCWs) as well. Our study aims to assess these psychological trends during the COVID-19 pandemic between the two most affected population groups, that is, patients and frontline healthcare workers.

MethodsA survey questionnaire including scales to assess fear, anxiety, stress, depression - PSS 10, and DASS 21 was distributed and sent to all COVID-19 suspected/confirmed individuals and healthcare workers at a tertiary care center along with a second visit after 14 days of answering the first questionnaire and this continued as follow up. Data were analyzed with the SPSS Version 23 using various tests of significance.

ResultsIn the community, COVID-19 patients in the age group 41-50 with respiratory tract symptoms and those who were home isolated/quarantined experienced a greater tendency of mental health problems. Healthcare workers posted in COVID-19 designated areas of the hospital displayed higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression.

ConclusionThe high degree of uncertainty associated with novel pathogens has a profound effect on the psychological state of suspected/confirmed cases as well as healthcare workers. Within the community, individuals suspected of having COVID-19 display a significant mental health burden, while HCWs also experience an unprecedented amount of stress during such enduring situations.

9886,"Clinical, immunological and virological characterization of COVID-19 patients that test re-positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR","BackgroundCOVID-19 pandemic is underway. Some COVID-19 cases re-tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA after discharge raising the public concern on their infectivity. Characterization of re-positive cases are urgently needed for designing intervention strategies.

MethodsClinical data were obtained through Guangdong COVID-19 surveillance network. Neutralization antibody titre was determined using a microneutralization assay. Potential infectivity of clinical samples was evaluated after the cell inoculation. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using three different RT-PCR kits and multiplex PCR with nanopore sequencing.

ResultsAmong 619 discharged COVID-19 cases, 87 were re-tested as SARS-CoV-2 positive in circumstance of social isolation. All re-positive cases had mild or moderate symptoms in initial diagnosis and a younger age distribution (mean, 30.4). Re-positive cases (n=59) exhibited similar neutralization antibodies (NAbs) titre distributions to other COVID-19 cases (n=150) parallel-tested in this study. No infective viral strain could be obtained by culture and none full-length viral genomes could be sequenced for all re-positive cases.

ConclusionsRe-positive SARS-CoV-2 was not caused by the secondary infection and was identified in around 14% of discharged cases. A robust Nabs response and a potential virus genome degradation were detected from nearly all re-positive cases suggesting a lower transmission risk, especially through a respiratory route.","Lu, J.; Peng, J.; Xiong, Q.; Liu, Z.; Lin, H.; Tan, X.; Kang, M.; Yuan, R.; Zeng, L.; Zhou, P.; Liang, C.; Yi, L.; Plessis, L.

25362,Clinical validation of point-of-care SARS-COV-2 BD Veritor antigen test by a single throat swab for rapid COVID-19 status on hospital patients predominantly without overt COVID symptoms,"BACKGROUNDFast identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected individuals is a strategically vital task to ensure correct management and quarantine. Rapid antigen test could be a supplement to the standard-of-care Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT). The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of the BD Veritor SARS-CoV-2 antigen test as a screening instrument in a hospital setting.

METHODSA cohort of prospective samples were collected from hospital staff and patients at the Emergency, Infectious Diseases and Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine departments at Hvidovre Hospital. All samples were collected using oropharyngeal swabs, and BD Veritor Antigen test results were paired with routine NAAT test results. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the antigen test were calculated using NAAT as reference.

RESULTSOverall, 809 samples from 674 individuals were included (average age 45 years, range 0-98 years). Among all samples, 8% were SARS-CoV-2 positive by NAAT testing and 5.3% by BD Veritor. The sensitivity of the antigen test was 63.1% and specificity 99.7%. The positive predictive value was 95.3%. False-positive rate was 4%. The cycle threshold value was significantly higher among individuals with false negative antigen tests compared to true positives.

CONCLUSIONThe sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values show that the BD Veritor antigen test from oropharyngeal collected specimens performs well. Antigen testing may be a supplement, but not substitute, to NAAT testing as the primary diagnostic modality in hospital settings where fast turnaround test results may assist in decisions regarding isolation and quarantine.","Bonde, J.; Ejegod, D.

27514,Introduction and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 in Denmark,"In early 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 became dominant across large parts of the world. In Denmark, comprehensive and real-time test, contact-tracing, and sequencing efforts were applied to sustain epidemic control. Here, we use these data to investigate the transmissibility, introduction, and onward transmission of B.1.1.7 in Denmark. In a period with stable restrictions, we estimated an increased B.1.1.7 transmissibility of 58% (95% CI: [56%,60%]) relative to other lineages. Epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses revealed that 37% of B.1.1.7 cases were related to the initial introduction in November 2020. Continuous introductions contributed substantially to case numbers, highlighting the benefit of balanced travel restrictions and self-isolation procedures coupled with comprehensive surveillance efforts, to sustain epidemic control in the face of emerging variants.","Michaelsen, T.

16932,2008 financial crisis vs 2020 economic fallout: How COVID-19 might influence fertility treatment and live births,"BackgroundThe economic and reproductive medicine response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has reduced the affordability and accessibility of fertility care. We sought to determine the impact of the 2008 financial recession and the COVID-19 recession on fertility treatments and cumulative live-births.

MethodsWe examined annual US natality, CDC IVF cycle activity and live birth data from 1999 to 2018 encompassing 3,286,349 treatment cycles, to estimate the age-stratified reduction in IVF cycles undertaken after the 2008 financial recession, with forward quantitative modelling of IVF cycle activity and cumulative live-births for 2020 to 2023.

ResultsThe financial recession of 2008 caused a four-year plateau in fertility treatments with a predicted 53,026 (95% CI 49,581 to 56,471) fewer IVF cycles and 16,872 (95% CI 16,713 to 17,031) fewer live births. A similar scale of economic recession would cause 67,386 (95% CI: 61,686 to 73,086) fewer IVF cycles between 2020 and 2023, with women younger than 35 years overall undertaking 22,504 (95% CI 14,320 to 30,690) fewer cycles, as compared to 4,445 (95% CI 3,144 to 5749) fewer cycles in women over the age of 40 years. This equates to overall 25,143 (95% CI: 22,408 to 27,877) fewer predicted live-births from IVF, of which only 490 (95% CI 381 to 601) are anticipated to occur in women over the age of 40 years.

ConclusionsThe COVID-19 recession could have a profound impact on US IVF live-birth rates in young women, further aggravating pre-existing declines in total fertility rates.

However, prior studies of these medications as potentially reversible risk factors for COVID-19 have been conflicting. We performed a case-control study involving clinician-abstracted data from 900 health records across 3 US medical centers. We incorporated sociobehavioral predictors of infectious exposure using geomapping to publicly-available data. We found no evidence for an association between chronic acid suppression and incident COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio 1.04, 95% CI: 0.92-1.17, P=0.515). However, we identified several medical and social features as positive (Latinx ethnicity, BMI [&ge;] 30, dementia, public transportation use, month of the pandemic) and negative (female sex, concurrent solid tumor, alcohol use disorder) predictors of new-onset infection.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, researchers and authorities are mainly concerned with carrying out quantitative studies (modeling and predictions) overcoming the scarcity of tests that lead us to under-reporting cases. To address these issues, we introduce a Bayesian approach to the SIR model with correction for under-reporting in the analysis of COVID-19 cases in Brazil. The proposed model was enforced to obtain estimates of important quantities such as the reproductive rate and the average infection period, along with the more likely date when the pandemic peak may occur.

To apprehend the transmission of COVID-19 and the improvement of air quality, we have studied air quality indicators (PM2.5, PM10, AQI, and NO2), CO2 emission, and climate variables (temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind velocity) in the extremely polluted and densely populated Southeast Asian megacity Dhaka, Bangladesh from March to June 2020. The Kendall and Spearman correlations were chosen to test the connotation of air quality and climate variables with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The average concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and CO2 were 65.0 {+/-} 37.9 and 87.1 {+/-} 52.8 {micro}m m-3, and 427 {+/-} 11.8 ppm, respectively. The average PM2.5 and PM10 drastically reduced up to 62% during COVID-19 lockdown in Dhaka comparing with March 2020 (before lockdown). Comparing with the same period in 2019, PM2.5 reduced up to 33.5%. The average NO2 concentration was 35.0 {micro}mol m-2 during the lockdown period in April, whereas 175.0 {micro}mol m-2 during March (before lockdown). A significant correlation was observed between COVID-19 cases and air quality indicators. A strong correlation was obtained between climate variables and the total number of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality representing a favorable condition for spreading the virus. Our study will be very expedient for policymakers to establish a mechanism for air pollution mitigation based on scientific substantiation, and also will be an essential reference for the advance research to improve urban air quality and the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the tropical nations.

11125,WICID framework Version 1.0: Criteria and considerations to guide evidence-informed decision-making on non-pharmacological interventions targeting COVID-19,"1IntroductionDecision-making on matters of public health and health policy requires the balancing of numerous, often conflicting factors. However, a broad societal discourse and a participatory decision-making process on the criteria underpinning the decision was often not feasible within the time constraints imposed on by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While evidence-to-decision frameworks are not able or intended to replace stakeholder participation, they can serve as a tool to approach relevancy and comprehensiveness of the criteria considered.

ObjectiveTo develop a decision-making framework adapted to the challenges of decision-making on national and sub-national level implementation of non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) measures to contain the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

MethodsWe employed the """"best-fit"""" framework synthesis technique and used the WHO-INTEGRATE framework Version 1.0 as a starting point. In a first phase adapted the framework through brainstorming exercises and application to exemplary case studies (e.g. school reopening). In a second phase we conducted a content analysis of comprehensive strategy documents intended to guide policymakers on the phasing out of applied lockdown measures in Germany. Based on factors and criteria identified in this process, we adapted previous framework versions into the WICID (WHO-INTEGRATE COVID-19) framework Version 1.0.

ResultsTwelve comprehensive strategy documents were included in the content analysis. The revised WICID framework consists of eleven criteria, supported by 48 aspects, the metacriterion quality of evidence and embraces a complexity and systems-perspective. The criteria cover implications for the health of individuals and populations due to and beyond COVID-19, infringement on liberties and fundamental human rights, acceptability and equity considerations, societal, environmental, and economic implications, as well as resource and feasibility considerations.

DiscussionIn a third phase, the proposed framework will be expanded through a comprehensive document analysis focusing on key-stakeholder groups across the society. The WICID framework can be a tool to support comprehensive evidence-informed decision-making processes.

2 Key-questionsO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABSAd-hoc Decision-making on matters of public health and health policy such as non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, requires decision-makers to balance numerous and often conflicting criteria. Insufficient consideration of relevant factors reduces acceptance and can limit the effectiveness of the intervention.

What are the new findings?Based on a content-analysis of comprehensive strategy documents, we newly developed WICID framework provides of 11+1 criteria informed by 47 aspects which are intended to support decision-makers in the balancing act of identifying and considering criteria of relevance.

What do the new findings imply?The usage of the WICID evidence-to-decision framework can support decision-makers and expert committees in making more balanced decision, even if not all voices of relevant stakeholders could be included in the process due to time constraints imposed by the rapid progress of the pandemic.","Stratil, J.

23733,Impact of close interpersonal contact on COVID-19 incidence: evidence from one year of mobile device data,"Close contact between people is the primary route for transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We sought to quantify interpersonal contact at the population-level by using anonymized mobile device geolocation data. We computed the frequency of contact (within six feet) between people in Connecticut during February 2020 - January 2021. Then we aggregated counts of contact events by area of residence to obtain an estimate of the total intensity of interpersonal contact experienced by residents of each town for each day. When incorporated into a susceptible-exposed-infective-removed (SEIR) model of COVID-19 transmission, the contact rate accurately predicted COVID-19 cases in Connecticut towns during the timespan. The pattern of contact rate in Connecticut explains the large initial wave of infections during March-April, the subsequent drop in cases during June-August, local outbreaks during August-September, broad statewide resurgence during September-December, and decline in January 2021. Contact rate data can help guide public health messaging campaigns to encourage social distancing and in the allocation of testing resources to detect or prevent emerging local outbreaks more quickly than traditional case investigation.

11535,Municipality- level predictors of COVID-19 mortality in Mexico: a cautionary tale,"BackgroundInequalities and burden of comorbidities of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vary importantly inside the countries. We aimed to analyze the Municipality-level factors associated with a high COVID-19 mortality rate of in Mexico.

MethodsWe retrieved information from 142,643 cumulative confirmed symptomatic cases and 18,886 deaths of COVID-19 as of June 20th, 2020 from the publicly available database of the Ministry of Health of Mexico. Public official data of the most recent census and surveys of the country were used to adjust a negative binomial regression model with the quintiles (Q) of the distribution of sociodemographic and health outcomes among 2,457 Municipality-level. Expected Mortality Rates (EMR), Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) and 95% Confidence Intervals are reported.

ResultsFactors associated with high MR of COVID-19, relative to Quintile 1 (Q1), were; diabetes prevalence (Q4, IRR=2.60), obesity prevalence (Q5, IRR=1.93), diabetes mortality rate (Q5, IRR=1.58), proportion of indigenous population (Q2, IRR=1.68), proportion of economically active population (Q5, IRR=1.50), density of economic units that operate essential activities (Q4, IRR=1.54) and population density (Q5, IRR=2.12). We identified 1,351 Municipality-level without confirmed COVID-19 deaths, of which, 202 had nevertheless high (Q4, Mean EMR= 8.0 deaths per 100,000) and 82 very high expected COVID-19 mortality (Q5, Mean EMR= 13.8 deaths per 100,000).

ConclusionThis study identified 1,351 Municipality-level of Mexico that, in spite of not having confirmed COVID-19 deaths yet, share characteristics that could eventually lead to a high mortality scenario later in the epidemic and warn against premature easing of mobility restrictions. Local information should be used to reinforce strategies of prevention and control of outbreaks in communities vulnerable to COVID-19.

Key messagesO_LIPredictors of COVID-19 mortality varied importantly between Municipality-level.

16234,Serological testing in addition to PCR screening for the re-opening of American colleges and universities: potential for cost-savings without compromising pandemic mitigation,"ImportanceThe addition of a serological testing could reduce the overall testing costs of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing reopening plan for colleges/universities in the United States, without compromising the efficacy of the testing plan.

ObjectivesTo determine whether a college/university reopening SARS-CoV-2 testing plan that includes serological testing can be cost-saving compared to a PCR-only testing.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe assessed costs of serological testing in addition to PCR testing under various scenarios of university sizes (2000, 10,000, and 40,000) and epidemic conditions (initial antibody prevalence 2.5-15%; cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence during the school year 5-30%) of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. We estimated total testing costs and relative percentage of cost-savings of different screening (i.e. targeted/ universal) and testing (i.e. in-sourcing/out-sourcing) scenarios between September 2020-May 2021.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresTesting costs of serological testing and PCR testing, Relative percentage of cost saving by including serology testing in addition to PCR testing.

ResultsIncluding baseline serology testing alongside routine regular PCR testing can reduce total test volumes and related costs throughout the school year. While the total testing cost is likely much lower if regular PCR testing is insourced compared to outsourced ($5 million vs $34 million for university size 10,000), including serologic testing could achieve the up to 20% cost-savings relative to PCR testing alone. The insourcing of serological testing when PCR testing is insourced can achieve greater cost-savings under high initial antibody prevalence (>5%) and cumulative incidence throughout the school year (>10%) at medium and large sized universities. If PCR testing is outsourced, however, the inclusion of serological testing becomes always preferred in most university sizes and epidemic conditions.

Conclusions and RelevanceWhile regular PCR testing alone is the preferred strategy for containing epidemics, including serology testing may help achieve cost-savings if outbreaks are anticipated, or if baseline seropositivity is high.

Key Points (96/100)O_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan the addition of a serological testing reduce the overall testing costs of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing reopening plan for universities in the United States?

FindingsThis costing study suggested that inclusion of serological testing in addition to outsourced PCR testing as part of a university re-opening strategy could achieve cost savings of up to 20%. The amount of savings, or additional costs, is dependent on insourcing or outsourcing of testing, epidemic conditions and university size.

MeaningThe relative cost-savings depend strongly on whether PCR and/or serology are being insourced or outsourced, university sizes and cumulative incidence.","Jo, Y.; Singh, R.; Rao, G.; Galea, S.; Nichols, B.

14359,The Uncertain COVID-19 Spread Pattern in India: A Statistical Analysis of the Current Situation,"There are standard techniques of forecasting the spread of pandemics. Uncertainty however is always associated with such forecasts. In this article, we are going to discuss the uncertain situation currently prevailing in the COVID-19 spread in India. For statistical analysis, we have considered the total number of cases for 60 consecutive days, from June 23 to August 21. We have seen that instead of taking data of all 60 days together, a better picture of uncertainty can be observed if we consider the data separately in three equal parts from June 23 to July 12, from July 13 to August 1, and from August 2 to August 21. For that we would first need to ascertain that the current spread pattern in India is almost exponential. Thereafter we shall show that the data regarding the total number of cases in India are not really behaving in an expected way, making forecasting the time to peak very difficult. We have found that the pandemic would perhaps change its pattern of growth from nearly exponential to nearly logarithmic, which we have earlier observed in the case of Italy, in less than 78 days starting from August 2.","Baruah, H.

6148,"Prediction of the Epidemic Peak of Covid19 in Egypt, 2020","ObjectivesSince December 2019 a pandemic of new novel coronavirus has started from Wuhan, China, in Egypt, the first case reported on February 14, 2020. In this study we aimed to predict the time of possible peak and simulate the changes could be happen by the social behavior of Egyptians during Ramadan (the holy month).

MethodsSIR and SEIR compartmental models were used to predict the peak time. We simulated different expected scenarios based to examine their effects on the peak timing.

ResultsWe found that the peak most likely to be in middle of June 2020. Simulating different transmission rate probability and R0 the earliest peak could to be in the May 20 and latest one could be in 18 July. The peak shifted much earlier to 11th April 2020 without lockdown and other mitigation strategies.

ConclusionSocial behaviors of citizens during the holy month will dramatically affect the peak timing. Mitigations strategies and other lockdown measure helped to delay the expected peak.","El Desouky, E. D.",2020-05-05,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.30.20086751,1,Eman D.

7750,Exploring the spread dynamics of COVID-19 inMorocco,"Despite some similarities of the dynamic of COVID-19 spread in Morocco and other countries, the infection, recovery and death rates remain very variable. In this paper, we analyze the spread dynamics of COVID-19 in Morocco within a standard susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-death (SEIRD) model. We have combined SEIRD model with a time-dependent infection rate function, to fit the real data of i) infection counts and ii) death rates due to COVID-19, for the period between March 2nd and Mai 15th 2020. By fitting the infection rate, SEIRD model placed the infection peak on 04/24/2020 and could reproduce it to a large extent on the expense of recovery and death rates. Fitting the SEIRD model to death rates gives rather satisfactory predictions with a maximum of infections on 04/06/2020. Regardless of the low peak position, the confirmed cases and transmission rate were well reproduced.","Naji, M.",2020-05-22,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.18.20106013,1,Mohamed Naji,University of Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.18.20106013v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.18.20106013v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
18925,"The Impact of COVID-19 on Care Seeking Behavior of Patients at Tertiary Care Follow-up Clinics: A Cross-Sectional Telephone Survey. Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.","BackgroundCOVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is among the most obscure global pandemics resulting in diverse health and economic disruptions. It adversely affects the routine health care delivery and health service uptake by patients. However, its impact on care-seeking behaviour is largely unknown in Ethiopia.

ObjectiveThis study was to determine the impact of the pandemic on care-seeking behaviour of patients with chronic health condition at Tikur Anbessa Specialized hospital in Addis Ababa.

MethodsA cross-sectional hospital-based survey conducted between May and July 2020 on patients whose appointment was between March to June 2020. Sample of 750 patients were approached using phone call and data collection was done using a pretested questionnaire. After cleaning, the data entered in to IBM SPSS software package for analysis.

ResultsA total of 644 patients with a median age of 25 years, and M: F ratio of 1:1.01 was described with a response rate of 86%. A loss to follow up, missed medication and death occurred in 70%, 12%, and 1.3% of the patients respectively. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, patients above 60 years old were more likely to miss follow-up (OR-23.28 (9.32-58.15), P<001). Patients who reported fear of COVID-19 at the hospital were 19 times more likely to miss follow-up (adjusted OR=19.32, 95% CI:10.73-34.79, P<0.001), while patients who reported transportation problems were 6.5 times more likely to miss follow-up (adjusted OR=6.11, 95% CI:3.06-12.17, P<0.001).

ConclusionsCOVID-19 pandemic affected the care-seeking behaviour of patients with chronic medical condition adversely and the impact was more pronounced among patients with severe disease, fear of COVID19 and with transportation problems. Education on preventive measures of COVID-19, use of phone clinic and improving chronic illness services at the local health institutions may reduce loss to follow-up among these patients.

What is already known?O_LIAs a result of COVID-19, an essential maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) services in Addis Ababa city showed that first antenatal attendance and under-five pneumonia treatment decreased by 12 and 35%.
C_LIO_LIA drop in client flow was ascribed to fear of acquiring COVID-19 at health facilities, limited access due to movement restrictions, and dedication of health facilities as COVID-19 treatment centers.
C_LI

What are the new findings?O_LIA cross-sectional hospital-based telephone survey indicated that a loss to follow up, missed medication and death occurred in 70%, 12%, and 1.3% of patients with chronic medical conditions respectively.
C_LI

What do the new findings imply?O_LIFear of COVID-19 and transportation problems are the most commonly stated reasons thus, the finding implies that since health care services to patients with chronic medical conditions is concentrated in specialized referral hospitals mostly aggregated in big cities, patients who travel long distance to get the service are at high risk of Loss to follow up.
C_LIO_LIStrengthening the chronic care service at a local health institutions, and promoting COVD-19 preventive measures, may help decrease the LTFU and associated complications.

11875,Development and Validation of a Web-Based Severe COVID-19 Risk Prediction Model,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) carries high morbidity and mortality globally. Identification of patients at risk for clinical deterioration upon presentation would aid in triaging, prognostication, and allocation of resources and experimental treatments.

Research QuestionCan we develop and validate a web-based risk prediction model for identification of patients who may develop severe COVID-19, defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and/or death?

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study reviewed 415 patients admitted to a large urban academic medical center and community hospitals. Covariates included demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. The independent association of predictors with severe COVID-19 was determined using multivariable logistic regression. A derivation cohort (n=311, 75%) was used to develop the prediction models. The models were tested by a validation cohort (n=104, 25%).

ResultsThe median age was 66 years (Interquartile range [IQR] 54-77) and the majority were male (55%) and non-White (65.8%). The 14-day severe COVID-19 rate was 39.3%; 31.7% required ICU, 24.6% mechanical ventilation, and 21.2% died. Machine learning algorithms and clinical judgment were used to improve model performance and clinical utility, resulting in the selection of eight predictors: age, sex, dyspnea, diabetes mellitus, troponin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and aspartate aminotransferase. The discriminative ability was excellent for both the severe COVID-19 (training area under the curve [AUC]=0.82, validation AUC=0.82) and mortality (training AUC= 0.85, validation AUC=0.81) models. These models were incorporated into a mobile-friendly website.

InterpretationThis web-based risk prediction model can be used at the bedside for prediction of severe COVID-19 using data mostly available at the time of presentation.","Woo, S. H.; Rios-Diaz, A.

25406,Differential Performance of CoronaCHEK SARS-CoV-2 Lateral Flow Antibody Assay by Geographic Origin of Samples,"BackgroundWe assessed the performance of CoronaCHEK lateral flow assay on samples from Uganda and Baltimore to determine the impact of geographic origin on assay performance.

MethodsSerum samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ individuals (Uganda: 78 samples from 78 individuals and Baltimore: 266 samples from 38 individuals) and from pre-pandemic individuals (Uganda 1077 and Baltimore 532) were evaluated. Prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated to identify factors associated with a false-positive test.

ResultsAfter first positive PCR in Ugandan samples the sensitivity was: 45% (95% CI 24,68) at 0-7 days; 79% (95%CI 64,91) 8-14 days; and 76% (95%CI 50,93) >15 days. In samples from Baltimore, sensitivity was: 39% (95% CI 30, 49) 0-7 days; 86% (95% CI 79,92) 8-14 days; and 100% (95% CI 89,100) 15 days post positive PCR. The specificity of 96.5% (95% CI 97.5,95.2) in Ugandan samples was significantly lower than samples from Baltimore 99.3% (95% CI 98.1,99.8), p<0.01. In Ugandan samples, individuals with a false positive result were more likely to be male (PR 2.04, 95% CI 1.03,3.69) or individuals who had a fever more than a month prior to sample acquisition (PR 2.87, 95% CI 1.12,7.35).

ConclusionsSensitivity of the CoronaCHEK was similar in samples from Uganda and Baltimore. The specificity was significantly lower in Ugandan samples than in Baltimore samples. False positive results in Ugandan samples appear to correlate with a recent history of a febrile illness, potentially indicative of a cross-reactive immune response in individuals from East Africa.","Baker, O.

3731,Separate Fever Clinics Prevent the Spread of COVID-19 and Offload Emergency Resources: Analysis from a large tertiary hospital in China,"ObjectivesCOVID-19 began spreading widely in China in January 2020. Outpatient """"Fever Clinics"""" (FCs), instituted during the SARS epidemic in 2003 were upgraded to provide COVID-19 screening and prevention attached to large tertiary hospitals. We sought to analyze the effect of upgraded FCs to detecting COVID-19 at our institution.

DesignA population-based cross-sectional study.

ParticipantsA total of 6,365 patients were screened in the FC.

MethodsThe FC of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) was upgraded on January 20, 2020. We performed a retrospective study of patients presenting to the FC between December 12, 2019 to February 29, 2020, covering a period of 40 days before and after upgrading the FC. All necessary data, including baseline patient information, diagnoses, follow-up conditions for critical patients, transfer information between the FC and emergency department (ED) were collected and analyzed.

Results6,365 patients were screened in the FC, among whom 2,192 patients were screened before January 21, 2020, while 3,453 were screened afterwards. Screening results showed that upper respiratory infection was the major disease associated with fever. Compared to before the outbreak, patients transferred from the FC to ED decreased significantly [39.21% vs 15.75%, p<0.001] and tended to spend more time in the FC [55 vs 203mins, p<0.001]. For critically-ill patients waiting for a screening result, the total length of stay in the FC was 22mins before the outbreak, compared to 442mins after the outbreak (p< 0.001). The number of in-hospital deaths of critical-care patients seen first in the FC was 9 of 29 patients before the outbreak and 21 of 38 after (p<0.050). Nineteen COVID-19 cases were confirmed in the FC, but no other patients or medical care providers were cross-infected.

ConclusionThe work-load of the FC increased after the COVID-19 outbreak and effectively prevented COVID-19 from spreading in the hospital,as well as offload ED resources.","Wang, J.; Zong, L.; Zhang, J.; Sun, H.; Joseph, W.

4602,Mesenchymal stromal cells for COVID-19: A living systematic review protocol,"ObjectiveTo determine the impact of mesenchymal stromal cells outcomes important to patients with COVID-19.

DesignThis is the protocol of a living systematic review.

Data sourcesWe will conduct searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature and in a centralised repository in L{middle dot}OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L{middle dot}OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L{middle dot}OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methodsWe adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question.

We will include randomised trials evaluating the effect of mesenchymal stromal cells versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomised trials evaluating other coronavirus infections, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19 will be searched in case we find no direct evidence from randomised trials, or if the direct evidence provides low- or very low-certainty for critical outcomes.

Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will pool the results using meta-analysis and will apply the GRADE system to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates.

Ethics and disseminationNo ethics approval is considered necessary. The results of this review will be widely disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, social networks and traditional media.

14461,Determinants of SARS-CoV-2 receptor gene expression in upper and lower airways,"BackgroundThe recent outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has led to a worldwide pandemic. A subset of COVID-19 patients progresses to severe disease, with high mortality and limited treatment options. Detailed knowledge of the expression regulation of genes required for viral entry into respiratory epithelial cells is urgently needed.

MethodsHere we assess the expression patterns of genes required for SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, and their regulation by genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors, throughout the respiratory tract using samples collected from the upper (nasal) and lower airways (bronchi).

FindingsGenes encoding viral receptors and activating protease are increased in the nose compared to the bronchi in matched samples and associated with the proportion of secretory epithelial cells in cellular deconvolution analyses. Current or ex-smoking was found to increase expression of these genes only in lower airways, which was associated with a significant increase in the predicted proportion of goblet cells. Both acute and second hand smoke exposure were found to increase ACE2 expression while inhaled corticosteroids decrease ACE2 expression in the lower airways. A strong association of DNA- methylation with ACE2 and TMPRSS2- mRNA expression was identified.

InterpretationGenes associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into cells are high in upper airways, but strongly increased in lower airways by smoke exposure. In contrast, ICS decreases ACE2 expression, indicating that inhaled corticosteroids are unlikely to increase the risk for more severe COVID-19 disease.

4675,A Validation Study for the Successful Isolation Policy in China: a Meta-Analysis in COVID-19,"COVID-19 is quickly spreading around the world and carries along with it a significant threat to public health. This study sought to apply meta-analysis to more precisely and accurately estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the isolation policy across countries, and the corresponding public health capability to care for patients. Prior estimates of R0 have varied widely and range from 1.95 to 6.49. Utilizing meta-analysis techniques we determined a more robust estimation of 3.05 for R0, which is substantially larger than that provided by the WHO. We also present the infectious rate standardized to per million population, which has proved to be a good index to determine whether the isolation measures in specific countries are effective. Also, this standardized infection rate can be used to determine whether the current infectious severity status is out of range of the national health capacity. Finally, we utilize our robust estimate of R0 and the standardized infectious rate to illustrate that the early and aggressive isolation measures enforced by the Chinese government were substantially more effective in controlling the negative impact COVID-19 than the more permissive measures enacted early in Italy and the United States.","Dong, J.; Zhou, Y.; Zhang, Y.; Franz, D.",2020-04-18,Respiratory Medicine,10.1101/2020.04.15.20065102,1,Jianghu Dong,College of Public Health,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.15.20065102v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.15.20065102v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.6339/JDS.202007_18(3).0016
3529,Simple model for Covid-19 epidemics - back-casting in China and forecasting in the US,"Abstract and FindingsIn our previous work, we analyze, in near-real time, evolution of Covid-19 epidemic in China for the first 22 days of reliable data (up to February 6, 2020). In this work, we used the data for the whole 87 days (up to March 13, 2020) in China and the US data available till March 31 (day 70) for systematic evaluation of the logistic model to predict epidemic growth. We sequentially estimated sets of model parameters (maximum number of cases K, growth rate r, and half-time t0) and the epidemic """"end time"""" t95 (defined as the time when the number of cases, predicted or actual, reached 95% of the maximum). The estimates of these parameters were done for sequences of reported cases growing daily (back-casting for China and forecasting for the US). In both countries, the estimates of K grew very much in time during the exponential and nearly exponential phases making longer term forecasting not reliable. For the US, the current estimate of the maximum number of cases K is about 265,000 but it is very likely that it will grow in the future. However, running estimates of the """"end time"""" t95 were in a much smaller interval for China (60 - 70 days vs. the actual value of 67). For the US, the values estimated from the data sequences going back two weeks from now range from 70 to 80 days. If the behavior of the US epidemic is similar to the previous Chinese development, the number of reported cases could reach a maximum around April 10 to 14.","Hermanowicz, S.

23924,"U.S. adolescents' mental health and COVID-19-related changes in technology use, Fall 2020","Preliminary reports suggest that during COVID-19, adolescents mental health has worsened while technology and social media use has increased. Much data derives from early in the pandemic, when schools were uniformly remote and personal/family stressors related to the pandemic were limited. This cross-sectional study, conducted during Fall 2020, examines the correlation between mental wellbeing and COVID-19-related changes in technology use, along with influence of COVID-19-related stressors, school status (in-person versus remote), and social media use for coping purposes, among 978 U.S. adolescents. Results suggest self-reported daily social media and technology use increased significantly from prior to COVID-19 through Fall 2020. Increased social media use was significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms regardless of other theoretical moderators or confounders of mental health (e.g., demographics, school status, importance of technology, COVID-19-related stress). Despite literature suggesting that remote learning may result in adverse mental health outcomes, we did not find local school reopening to be associated with current depressive/anxiety symptoms, nor with COVID-19-related increases in technology use. Self-reported use of social media for coping purposes moderated the association between increased social media use and mental health symptoms; in other words, some social media use may have positive effects. Although much prior research has focused on social media use as a marker of stress, we also found that increased video gaming and TV/movie watching were also associated with internalizing symptoms, in accordance with others' work. Future research should explore in more granular detail what, if any, social media and technology use is protective during a pandemic, and for whom, to help tailor prevention efforts.","Burke, T.

14627,This time is different: model-based evaluation of the implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection kinetics for disease control,"As the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic passes from an acute to a chronic situation, countries and territories are grappling with the issue of how to reopen safely. The unique kinetics of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, with its significant presymptomatic transmission, presents an unprecedented challenge to our intuitions. In this context, a generalizable quantitative understanding of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity on disease control strategies is vital. We used a previously published time-dependent model of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (He et al., 2020) to parameterize an epidemiological model of transmission, which was then used to explore the effect of various disease control measures. Our analysis suggests that using symptom-based isolation alone as a control strategy is ineffective in limiting the spread of COVID-19, in contrast to its effectiveness in other diseases, such as SARS and influenza. Additionally, timeliness of testing and tracing strategies to reduce time to isolation, along with widespread adoption of measures to limit transmission are critical for any containment strategy. Our findings suggest that for symptom-based isolation and testing strategies to be effective, reduced transmission is required, reinforcing the importance of measures to limit transmission. From a public health strategy perspective, our findings lend support to the idea that symptomatic isolation should not form the primary basis for COVID-19 disease control.","Johnson, K.

10644,Silk fabric as a protective barrier for personal protective equipment and as a functional material for face coverings during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BackgroundThe worldwide shortage of single-use N95 respirators and surgical masks due to the COVID-19 pandemic has forced many health care personnel to prolong the use of their existing equipment as much as possible. In many cases, workers cover respirators with available masks in an attempt to extend their effectiveness against the virus. Due to low mask supplies, many people instead are using face coverings improvised from common fabrics. Our goal was to determine what fabrics would be most effective in both practices.

Methods and findingsWe examined the hydrophobicity of fabrics (silk, cotton, polyester), as measured by their resistance to the penetration of small and aerosolized water droplets, an important transmission avenue for the virus causing COVID-19. We also examined the breathability of these fabrics and their ability to maintain hydrophobicity despite undergoing repeated cleaning. Tests were done when fabrics were fashioned as an overlaying barrier and also when constructed as do-it-yourself face coverings. As a protective barrier and face covering, silk is more effective at impeding the penetration and absorption of droplets due to its greater hydrophobicity relative to other tested fabrics. Silk face coverings repelled droplets as well as masks, but unlike masks they are hydrophobic and can be readily sterilized for immediate reuse.

ConclusionsSilk is an effective hydrophobic barrier to droplets, more breathable than other fabrics that trap humidity, and are readily re-useable via cleaning. Therefore, silk can serve as an effective material for protecting respirators under clinical conditions and as a material for face coverings.","Parlin, A. F.; Stratton, S. M.; Culley, T.

3896,Interaction between malarial transmission and BCG vaccination with COVID-19 incidence in the world map: A changing landscape human immune system?,"BackgroundCOVID-19 (Corona virus Disease-2019) is a new public health emergency and is a pandemic currently. Incidence and mortality of COVID-19 vary in different geographical areas. In this study we aimed to analyse the relationship between malaria transmission and BCG vaccination with COVID-19 incidence in the world map.

Materials and methodsWe collected malaria cases data (World Health Organisation (WHO), 2018), worldwide COVID-19 cases and mortality data (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) and data on BCG vaccination. COVID-19 incidence and mortality was compared.

FindingsData on 5316978938 persons from 166 countries were analysed. Malaria incidence rate was negatively correlated with COVID-19 incidence rate (correlation coefficient = -0.513, p<0.001). Malaria free countries had significantly higher number of COVID-19 cases compared to malaria endemic countries. In Europe and Americas, countries, which have higher BCG vaccination coverage, had significantly less mortality per thousand population compared to those with low BCG coverage (median 0.0002 (0-0.0005) vs 0.0029 (0.0002-0.0177), p=0.017). The case fatality ratio of COVID-19 was related nonlinearly to the malaria incidence.

ConclusionsThe results suggest the changing human immune system as we progress to eliminate parasitic diseases with time. Chloroquine exposure in malaria endemic zones might have a protective effect.

Summary boxO_ST_ABS""""What is already known on this subject?""""C_ST_ABSTo the best of the authors no similar evidence, of the effect of malarial transmission on the COVID-19 global distribution is known. The effect of the Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine on modifying the human immune system has been reported before and is postulated to protective against certain viral infections like Influenza A (H1N1) and herpes virus.

""""What this study adds?""""This study finds that COVID-19 incidence, worldwide is less in countries, which are malaria-endemic. In the European and American countries, increased BCG coverage may have some mortality advantage against COVID-19. The case fatality rate was related to malaria incidence, however, in a complex way. This could be a window into the changing landscape of human immune system as we progress to eliminate parasitic disease with time or this could be due to long-term protective body level of anti-malarials like chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in countries with higher malaria incidence rate.","Goswami, R.

9462,Estimating the COVID-19 epidemic trajectory and hospital capacity requirements in South West England: a mathematical modelling framework,"ObjectivesTo develop a regional model of COVID-19 dynamics, for use in estimating the number of infections, deaths and required acute and intensive care (IC) beds using the South West of England (SW) as an example case.

DesignOpen-source age-structured variant of a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) deterministic compartmental mathematical model. Latin hypercube sampling and maximum likelihood estimation were used to calibrate to cumulative cases and cumulative deaths.

SettingSW at a time considered early in the pandemic, where National Health Service (NHS) authorities required evidence to guide localised planning and support decision-making.

ParticipantsPublicly-available data on COVID-19 patients.

Primary and secondary outcome measuresThe expected numbers of infected cases, deaths due to COVID-19 infection, patient occupancy of acute and IC beds and the reproduction (""""R"""") number over time.

ResultsSW model projections indicate that, as of the 11th May 2020 (when  lockdown measures were eased), 5,793 (95% credible interval, CrI, 2,003 - 12,051) individuals were still infectious (0.10% of the total SW England population, 95%CrI 0.04 - 0.22%), and a total of 189,048 (95%CrI 141,580 - 277,955) had been infected with the virus (either asymptomatically or symptomatically), but recovered, which is 3.4% (95%CrI 2.5 - 5.0%) of the SW population. The total number of patients in acute and IC beds in the SW on the 11th May 2020 was predicted to be 701 (95%CrI 169 - 1,543) and 110 (95%CrI 8 - 464) respectively. The R value in SW England was predicted to be 2.6 (95%CrI 2.0 - 3.2) prior to any interventions, with social distancing reducing this to 2.3 (95%CrI 1.8 - 2.9) and lockdown/ school closures further reducing the R value to 0.6 (95CrI% 0.5 - 0.7).

ConclusionsThe developed model has proved a valuable asset for local and regional healthcare services. The model will be used further in the SW as the pandemic evolves, and - as open source software - is portable to healthcare systems in other geographies.

17714,"Early COVID-19 Therapy with Azithromycin Plus Nitazoxanide, Ivermectin or Hydroxychloroquine in Outpatient Settings Significantly Reduced Symptoms Compared to Known Outcomes in Untreated Patients.","BackgroundWhile there was a lack of pharmacological interventions proven to be effective in early, outpatient settings for COVID-19, in a prospective, open-label observational study (pre-AndroCoV Trial) the use of nitazoxanide, ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine demonstrated similar effects, and apparent improvement of outcomes compared to untreated patients. The unexpected apparent positive results led to ethical questions on the employment of further full placebo-control studies in early stage COVID-19. The objective of the present study was to elucidate whether the conduction of a full placebo-control RCT was still ethically viable, through a comparative analysis with two control-groups.

Materials and methodsActive group (AG) consisted of mild-to-moderate early stage COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Pre AndroCoV-Trial, treated with nitazoxanide ivermectin, or hydroxychloroquine in selected cases, in association with azithromycin. Vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, glucocorticoids and anticoagulants, when clinically recommended. Control Group 1 (CG1) consisted of a retrospectively obtained group of untreated patients from the same population as those from the Pre-AndroCoV Trial, and Control Group 2 (CG2) resulted from a precise prediction of clinical outcomes, based on a thorough and structured review of articles indexed in PubMed and MEDLINE and statements by official government agencies and specific medical societies. For both CGs, patients were matched for proportion between sex, age, obesity and other comorbidities. Results: Compared to CG1 and CG2, AG showed a reduction of 31.5 to 36.5% in viral shedding (p < 0.0001), 70 to 85% and 70 to 73% in duration of COVID-19 clinical symptoms when including and not including anosmia and ageusia, respectively ((p < 0.0001 for both), and 100% in respiratory complications through the parameters of the Brescia COVID-19 Respiratory Scale (p < 0.0001). For every 1,000 confirmed cases for COVID-19, a minimum of 140 patients were prevented from hospitalization (p < 0.0001), 50 from mechanical ventilation, and five deaths, when comparing to age-, sex- and comorbidity-matched non-treated patients with similar initial disease severity at the moment of diagnosis.

ConclusionApparent benefits of the combination between early detection and early pharmacological approaches for COVID-19 demonstrated to be consistent when when compared to different control groups of untreated patients. The potential benefits could allow a large number of patients prevented from hospitalizations, deaths and persistent symptoms after COVID-19 remission. The potential impact on COVID-19 disease course and numbers of negative outcomes and the well-established safety profile of the drugs proposed by the Pre-AndroCoV Trial led to ethical questions regarding the conduction of further placebo control randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for early COVID-19. Early pharmacological approaches including azithromycin in combination with any of the options between nitazoxanide, ivermectin or optionally hydroxychloroquine should be considered for those diagnosed with COVID-19 presenting less than seven days of symptoms. Of the three drugs, we opted for nitazoxanide, due to more extensive demonstration of in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity, proven efficacy against other viruses in humans, and steadier safety profile.","Cadegiani, F.

8452,A SARS-CoV-2 serological assay to determine the presence of blocking antibodies that compete for human ACE2 binding,"As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread around the world, there is an urgent need for new assay formats to characterize the humoral response to infection. Convalescent serum is being used for treatment and for isolation of patient-derived antibodies. However, currently there is not a simple means to estimate serum bulk neutralizing capability. Here we present an efficient competitive serological assay that can simultaneously determine an individuals seropositivity against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and estimate the neutralizing capacity of anti-Spike antibodies to block interaction with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) required for viral entry. In this ELISA-based assay, we present natively-folded viral Spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD)-containing antigens via avidin-biotin interactions. Sera are then supplemented with soluble ACE2-Fc to compete for RBD-binding serum antibodies, and antibody binding quantified. Comparison of signal from untreated serum and ACE2-Fc-treated serum reveals the presence of antibodies that compete with ACE2 for RBD binding, as evidenced by loss of signal with ACE2-Fc treatment. In our test cohort of nine convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients, we found all patients had developed anti-RBD antibodies targeting the epitope responsible for ACE2 engagement. This assay provides a simple and high-throughput method to screen patient sera for potentially neutralizing anti-Spike antibodies to enable identification of candidate sera for therapeutic use.","Byrnes, J.

3096,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"In the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, currently vaccines and specific anti-viral treatment are not yet available. Thus, preventing viral transmission by case isolation, quarantine, and social distancing is essential to slowing its spread. Here we model social networks using weighted graphs, where vertices represent individuals and edges represent contact. As public health measures are implemented, connectivity in the graph decreases, resulting in lower effective reproductive numbers, and reduced viral transmission. For COVID-19, model parameters were derived from the coronavirus epidemic in China, validated by epidemic data in Italy, then applied to the United States. We calculate that, in the U.S., the public is able to contain viral transmission by limiting the average number of contacts per person to less than 7 unique individuals over each 5 day period. This increases the average social distance between individuals to 10 degrees of separation.","Zhao, P.

27041,Exploiting Molecular Basis of Age and Gender Differences in Outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 Infections.,"MotivationSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (coronavirus disease, 2019; COVID-19) is associated with adverse outcomes in patients. It has been observed that lethality seems to be related to the age of patients. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that ageing causes some modifications at a molecular level.

ObjectiveThe study aims to shed out light on a possible link between the increased COVID-19 lethality and the molecular changes that occur in elderly people.

MethodsWe considered public datasets on ageing-related genes and their expression at tissue level. We selected interactors that are known to be related to ageing process. Then, we performed a network-based analysis to identify interactors significantly related to both SARS-CoV-2 and ageing. Finally, we investigated changes on the expression level of coding genes at tissue, gender and age level.

ResultsWe observed a significant intersection between some SARS-CoV-2 interactors and ageing-related genes suggesting that those genes are particularly affected by COVID-19 infection. Our analysis evidenced that virus infection particularly affects ageing molecular mechanisms centred around proteins EEF2, NPM1, HMGA1, HMGA2, APEX1, CHEK1, PRKDC, and GPX4. We found that HMGA1, and NPM1 have a different expression in lung of males, while HMGA1, APEX1, CHEK1, EEF2, and NPM1 present changes in expression in males due to aging effects.

ConclusionOur study generated a mechanistic framework to explaining the correlation between COVID-19 incidence in elderly patients and molecular mechanisms of ageing. This will provide testable hypotheses for future investigation and pharmacological solutions tailored on specific age ranges.","Mercatelli, D.; Pedace, E.; Giorgi, F. M.; Guzzi, P.

22273,Rapid Impact Analysis of B 1.1.7 Variant on the Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in North Carolina,"BackgroundSeveral cases of the B1.1.7 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were identified in North Carolina first on January 23, 2021 in Mecklenburg County and later in Guilford County on January 28, 2021.[1,2] This variant has been associated with higher levels of transmissibility.[3-6] This study examines the potential impact of increased transmissibility as the B1.1.7 variant becomes more predominant given current vaccine distribution plans and existing non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs).

MethodWe explored the anticipated impact on the effective reproduction number for North Carolina and Guilford County given the date of import of B1.1.7. The approximate growth rate in proportion of B1.1.7 observed in the United Kingdom was fit and used to establish the estimate share of B1.1.7 circulating in North Carolina. Using the nowcasted reproduction numbers, a stochastic discrete compartmental model was fit with the current vaccination rates and B1.1.7 transmissibility to estimate the impact on the effective reproduction number.

ResultsWe found that the effective reproduction number for North Carolina and Guilford County may exceed one, indicating a return to accelerating spread of infection in April as the proportion of B1.1.7 increases. The effective reproduction number will likely decrease into March, then increase as the proportion of B1.1.7 increases in circulation in the population.

ConclusionsExisting non-pharmaceutical interventions will need to remain in effect through the spring. Given the current vaccination rate and these interventions, it is likely that there will be an increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections. The impact of the variant will likely be heterogeneous across North Carolina given the reproduction number and volume of susceptible persons in each county at the time of introduction of the variant. Age-based vaccinations will likely reduce the overall impact on hospitalizations. This analysis underlines the need for population level genetic surveillance to confirm the proportion of variants circulating.","Dewitt, M.

3692,Inflow restrictions can prevent epidemics when contact tracing efforts are effective but have limited capacity,"When a region tries to prevent an outbreak of an epidemic, like that of COVID-19, two broad strategies are initially available: limiting the inflow of infected cases using travel restrictions and quarantines, and reducing the transmissions from inflowing cases using contact tracing and community interventions. A large number of papers have used epidemiological models to argue that inflow restrictions are unlikely to be effective. We conduct a mathematical analysis using a simple epidemiological model and perform simulations which show how this conclusion changes if we relax the assumption of unlimited capacity in containment efforts such as contact tracing. In particular, when contact tracing is effective, but the system is close to being overwhelmed, moderate travel restrictions can have a very large effect on the probability of an epidemic.","Malmberg, H.; Britton, T.",2020-04-06,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.01.20050401,1,Hannes Malmberg,"University of Minnesota, Department of Economics",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050401v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050401v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1098/rsif.2020.0351
9514,Interregional SARS-CoV-2 spread from a single introduction outbreak in a meat-packing plant in northeast Iowa,"SARS-CoV-2 spread has proven to be especially difficult to mitigate in high risk settings, including nursing homes, cruises, prisons and various industrial settings. Among industrial settings, meat processing facilities in the United States have experienced particularly challenging outbreaks. We have sequenced SARS-CoV-2 whole viral genomes from individuals testing positive in an integrated regional healthcare system serving 21 counties in southwestern Wisconsin, northeastern Iowa and southeastern Minnesota, providing an overview of SARS-CoV-2 introduction and spread in a region spanning multiple jurisdictions with differing mitigation policies. While most viral introductions we detected were contained with only minor transmission chains, a striking exception was an outbreak associated with a meatpacking plant in Postville, IA. In this case, a single viral introduction led to unrestrained spread within the facility, affecting many staff and members of their households. Importantly, by surveilling viral sequences from the surrounding counties, we have documented the spread of this SARS-CoV-2 substrain from this epicenter to individuals in 13 cities in 7 counties in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota, a region spanning 185 square miles. This study highlights the regional public health consequences of failures to rapidly act to mitigate viral spread in a single industrial setting.","Richmond, C. S.; Sabin, A. P.; Jobe, D.

19665,Intense and Mild Wave of COVID-19 in The Gambia: a Cohort Analysis,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is evolving differently in Africa compared to other regions, with lower transmission and milder clinical presentation. Reasons for this are not fully understood. Recent data from Eastern and Southern Africa suggest that transmission may be higher than measured. Detailed epidemiological data in different African settings is urgently needed.

MethodsWe calculated cumulative rates of SAR-CoV-2 infections per 1,000 people at risk in The Gambia (2.42 million individuals) using publicly available data. We evaluated these rates in a cohort of 1,366 employees working at the MRC Unit The Gambia @LSHTM (MRCG) where systematic surveillance of symptomatic cases and contact tracing was implemented. Cumulative rates among the Gambian population were stratified by age groups and, among MRCG staff, by occupational exposure risk. SARS-CoV-2 testing was conducted on oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal samples with consistent sampling and laboratory procedures across cohorts.

FindingsBy September 2020, 3,579 cases of SARS-CoV-2 and 115 deaths had been identified; with 67% of cases detected in August. Among them, 191 cases were MRCG staff; all of them were asymptomatic/mild, with no deaths. The cumulative incidence rate for SARS-CoV-2 infection among MRCG staff (excluding those with occupational exposure risk) was 129 per 1,000, at least 20-fold higher than the estimations based on diagnosed cases in the adult Gambian population.

InterpretationOur findings are consistent with recent African sero-prevalence studies reporting high community transmission of SAR-CoV-2.

4692,Meteorological factors and domestic new cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in nine Asian cities: A time-series analysis,"AIMTo investigate the associations of meteorological factors and the daily new cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in nine Asian cities.

METHODPearsons correlation and generalized additive modeling were performed to assess the relationships between daily new COVID-19 cases and meteorological factors (daily average temperature and relative humidity) with the most updated data currently available.

RESULTSThe Pearson correlation showed that daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 were more correlated with the average temperature than with relative humidity. Daily new confirmed cases were negatively correlated with the average temperature in Beijing (r=-0.565, P<0.01), Shanghai (r=-0.471, P<0.01), and Guangzhou (r=-0.530, P<0.01), yet in contrast, positively correlated with that in Japan (r=0.441, P<0.01). In most of the cities (Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo, and Kuala Lumpur), generalized additive modeling analysis showed the number of daily new confirmed cases was positively associated with both average temperature and relative humidity, especially in lagged 3d model, where a positive influence of temperature on the daily new confirmed cases was discerned in 5 cities except in Beijing, Wuhan, Korea, and Malaysia. Nevertheless, the results were inconsistent across cities and lagged time, suggesting meteorological factors were unlikely to greatly influence the COVID-19 epidemic.

CONCLUSIONThe associations between meteorological factors and the number of COVID-19 daily cases are inconsistent across cities and lagged time. Large-scale public health measures and expanded regional research are still required until a vaccine becomes available and herd immunity is established.

Significance statementWith increasing COVID-19 cases across China and the world, and previous studies showing that meteorological factors may be associated with infectious disease transmission, the saying has it that when summer comes, the epidemic of COVID-19 may simultaneously fade away. We demonstrated the influence of meteorological factors on the daily domestic new cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in nine Asian cities. And we found that the associations between meteorological factors and the number of COVID-19 daily cases are inconsistent across cities and time. We think this important topic may give better clues on prevention, management, and preparation for new events or new changes that could happen in the COVID-19 epidemiology in various geographical regions and as we move towards Summer.","He, Z.; Chin, Y.; Huang, J.; He, Y.; Akinwunmi, B.

17153,Social and Psychiatric Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic and Distance Learning On High School Students: A Cross-Sectional Web-Based Survey Comparing Turkey and Denmark,"ObjectiveIn this study we investigated the socio-psychological effects of both the pandemic and distance learning on high school students in Turkey and Denmark. We aimed to assess whether there were any differences a) between students attending public or private schools in Turkey and b) between two countries having different approaches to pandemic and considerable socio-cultural and economic differences.

MethodsWe conducted a web-based questionnaire study in a cross-sectional design using Survey Monkey platform and sent out via social media to high school students from Turkey and Denmark. The survey collected socio-demographic data, several variables associated with pandemic and distance education and their effects on social life and psychological status. Additionally, emotional status was assessed using positive (PA) and negative affects (NA) schedule (PANAS). The survey ran from July 3 and August 31 2020.

ResultsWe studied 565 (mean age: 16.5 {+/-} 1.0) Turkish and 92 (mean age:17.7 {+/-} 1.0) Danish students, of whom the majority were female adolescents (63% vs 76%). Students educated in public (47.6%) and private high schools (52.4%) were nearly similar in number in Turkish group, whereas in the Danish sample almost all students were from public school (98.9%). Turkish students were significantly more likely to be compliant with the pandemic related restrictions. Besides that, there were significant socio-economic disparities between Turkish and Danish students and also within Turkey between public and private school students. Turkish online education system was significantly less adequate and satisfactory compared to the Danish system. These were even worse for those who were attending public schools in Turkey. Regardless of the socio-economic differences, the majority of the students in both countries has been negatively affected by the pandemic and related restrictions and had a negative opinion about distance education. This was also true for the PANAS scores. The total scores of PANAS were similar between Turkish and Danish students (PA: 27.0 {+/-} 7.6 versus 25.8 {+/-} 5.6; NA: 24.8{+/-} 7.5 versus 24.5{+/-} 7.3) and also within Turkey between public and private school students (PA: 26.8 {+/-} 7.5 versus 27.1 {+/-} 7.6; NA: 24.7{+/-} 7.2 versus 25.0{+/-} 7.8). While female students were significantly more severely affected in the Turkish group, no such gender differences were observed in the Danish group. Additionally, considerable portion of the students in Turkey and Denmark expressed loneliness (55.2% vs 59.8%, p<0.706), boredom (71.2% vs 58.7%, p=0.019) and anxiety towards the future (61.4% vs 22.8%, p<0.001). Decreased physical activity, sleep problems, eating disorders and domestic abuse were other complaints.

ConclusionsAdolescents from both countries have been severely affected by the pandemic and its related restrictions and expressed negative views about distance education. Turkish online education system seemed to be less satisfactory when compared to Danish system and within Turkey, public school students had significantly more disadvantages compared to those attending private schools. Despite the fact that there were several socio-economic inequalities among students, in general, there were no robust significant differences regarding psychological status and opinion about distance learning, indicating a global worsening of emotional status during pandemic.","Seyahi, L.

27471,ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION CHARACTERISTICS OF RAPID POINT OF CARE SARS-CoV-2 ANTIGEN TESTING IN KENYA,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a need for rapid identification of infectious cases. Testing barriers have prohibited adequate screening for SARS COV2, resulting in significant delays in treatment provision and commencement of outbreak control measures. This study aimed to generate evidence on the performance and implementation characteristics of the BD Veritor rapid antigen test as compared to the gold standard test for diagnosis of SARS COV2 in Kenya.

MethodsThis was a field test performance evaluation in symptomatic and asymptomatic adults undergoing testing for SARS COV2. Recruited participants were classified as SARS-CoV2-positive based on the locally implemented gold standard reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test performed on nasopharyngeal swabs. 272 antigen tests were performed with simultaneous gold standard testing, allowing us to estimate sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for the BD Veritor rapid antigen test platform. Implementation characteristics were assessed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research for feasibility, acceptability, turn-around time, and ease-of-use metrics.

Results and DiscussionWe enrolled 97 PCR negative symptomatic and 128 PCR negative asymptomatic, and 28 PCR positive symptomatic and 19 PCR positive asymptomatic participants. Compared to the gold standard, the sensitivity of the BD Veritor antigen test was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI] 86.6 to 100.0) while the specificity was 98% (95% confidence interval [CI] 96 to 100). The sensitivity of BD Veritor antigen test was higher among symptomatic (100%) compared to asymptomatic (84%) participants, although this difference was not statistically significant. There was also a lack of association between cycle threshold value and sensitivity of BD Veritor test. The BD Veritor test had quick turnaround time and minimal resource requirements, and laboratory personnel conducting testing felt that it was easier to use than the gold standard RT-PCR.

ConclusionThe BD Veritor rapid antigen test exhibited excellent sensitivity and specificity when used to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection among both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in varied population settings in Kenya. It was feasible to implement and easy to use, with rapid turnaround time.","Muthamia, E.; Mbugua, S.; Mungai, M.; Bandawe, G.; Qadri, F.; Kawser, Z.; Lockman, S.; Ivers, L.; Walt, D.

27589,Association between Preventive Measures against Workplace Infection and Preventive Behavior against Personal Infection,"ObjectivesTo prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, it is necessary for each individual to adopt infection prevention behavior. We investigated the effect of infection control measures implemented in the workplace on personal infection prevention behavior.

MethodsWe conducted a self-administered questionnaire survey through the Internet from December 22 to 25, 2020, during which period COVID-19 was spreading. Among respondents aged 20 to 65 years (n=27,036), a total of 21,915 workers were included in the analysis after excluding self-employed workers (n=2,202), workers in small/home offices (n=377), and agriculture, forestry, and fisheries workers (n=212), etc., whose personal infection prevention behavior was almost the same as infection control measures taken in the workplace.

ResultsThe results showed that as the number of infection control measures in the workplace increased, implementation of infection prevention behavior by individuals also significantly increased. However, the relationship differed depending on the type of personal infection prevention behavior. Specifically, infection control measures against COVID-19 in the workplace may affect personal infection prevention behavior.

ConclusionImplementation of infection control measures in the workplace appears to deepen personal understanding of infection prevention behaviors, and increases awareness of the importance of individual infection prevention behavior and its implementation by all individuals. These findings may be applicable not only to COVID-19 measures but also to responses to other emerging infections and seasonal influenza.","Kawasumi, M.; Nagata, T.; Ando, H.; Hino, A.; Tateishi, S.; Tsuji, M.; Matsuda, S.; Fujino, Y.; Mori, K.",2021-06-09,Occupational And Environmental Health,10.1101/2021.06.08.21258584,1,Tomohisa Nagata,"University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.08.21258584v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.08.21258584v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
10661,Group testing: revisiting the ideas,"The task of identification of randomly scattered  bad items in a fixed set of objects is a frequent one, and there are many ways to deal with it.  Group testing (GT) refers to the testing strategy aiming to effectively replace the inspection of single objects by the inspection of groups spanning more than one object. First announced by Dorfman in 1943, the methodology has underwent vigorous development, and though many related research still takes place, the ground ideas remain the same. In the present paper, we revisit two classical GT algorithms: the Dorfmans algorithm and the halving algorithm. Our fresh treatment of the latter and expository comparison of the two is devoted to dissemination of GT ideas which are so important in the current COVID-19 induced pandemic situation.","Skorniakov, V.; Leipus, R.; Juzeliunas, G.; Staliunas, K.",2021-03-11,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.29.20142323,2,Remigijus Leipus,Vilnius University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.20142323v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.20142323v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,"NA"
5822,Geographical identification of the vulnerable groups during COVID-19 crisis: the typhoon eye effect and its boundary conditions,"AimAlthough some studies suggest the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with negative consequences on physical health, our knowledge about the detrimental effects of COVID-19 on peoples mental health is still nascent. This study uses typhoon eye theory to offer insights in helping clinical psychiatrists to screen people with well-being issues during COVID-19 outbreak.

MethodsWe collected survey data from working adults across different geographical areas in China on 20 and 21 February 2020 during the outbreak of COVID-19. The sample contains 308 working adults, who were in various parts of China, with varying distance to the epicenter of Wuhan.

ResultsIndividual adults distance to the epicenter was negatively associated with life satisfaction ({beta} = -0.235, 95% CI -0.450 to -0.020, p = 0.032). This association between distance and life satisfaction was significant only for adults who were young or had smaller family sizes. For example, the negative relationship was strongest when the individuals were in the age bracket of 20 years old (15.7%; {beta} = -0.703, 95% CI -1.098 to -0.307; p = 0.001) and single (32.3%; {beta} = -0.767, 95% CI -1.125 to -0.408; p < 0.001).

ConclusionOur results that peoples well-being deteriorates by the distance from the epicenter for specific groups of people help guide mental healthcare providers towards the regions that are further away from the epicenter in the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Meanwhile, our results indicate the practitioners should be cautious of using typhoon eye effect for individuals who were older or had a larger family size.","Tang, P. M.; Zhang, S. X.; Li, C.

22784,Controlling the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malawi: results from a panel study,"Many African countries have experienced a first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic between June and August of 2020. According to case counts reported daily by epidemiological surveillance systems, infection rates remained low in most countries. This defied early models of the potential impact of COVID-19 on the continent, that projected large outbreaks and massive strain on health systems. Theories proposed to explain the apparently limited spread of the novel coronavirus in most African countries have emphasized 1) early actions by health authorities (e.g., border closures) and 2) biological or environmental determinants of the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., warm weather, cross-immunity). In this paper, we explored additional factors that might contribute to the low recorded burden of COVID-19 in Malawi, a low-income country in Southeastern Africa. To do so, we used 4 rounds of panel data collected among a sample of adults during the first 6 months of the pandemic in the country. Our analyses of survey data on SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-related symptoms indicate that the size of the outbreak that occurred in June-August 2020 might be larger than recorded by surveillance systems that rely on RT-PCR testing. Our data also document the widespread adoption of physical distancing and mask use in response to the outbreak, whereas most measured patterns of social contacts remained stable during the course of the panel study. These findings will help better project, and respond to, future waves of the pandemic in Malawi and similar settings.","Banda, J.; Dube, A. N.; Brumfield, S.; Crampin, A. C.; Reniers, G.; Amoah, A.

21041,Evaluating the effects of re-opening plans on dynamics of COVID-19 in SP,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in early March 2020. In Brazil, Sao Paulo is the most affected state, comprising about 20% of the countrys cases. With no vaccine available to date, distancing measures have been taken to reduce virus transmission. To reduce the pandemics effect on the economy, the government of Sao Paulo has proposed a plan consisting of five phases of the gradual re-opening of activities. In this context, we have developed a mathematical model to simulate the gradual re-opening plan on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, in the city of Sao Paulo. The model shows that a precipitous reopening can cause a higher peak of the disease, which may compromise the local health system. Waiting for the reduction in the incidence of infected individuals for at least 15 days to phase transition is the most efficient strategy compared to the fixed-period scenario at each phase of the re-opening plan.","Rubio, F.

5816,Performance verification of detecting COVID-19 specific antibody by using four chemiluminescence immunoassay systems,"BackgroundThe purpose of current study is to evaluate the analytical performance of seven kits for detecting IgM/IgG antibody of corona virus (2019-nCoV) by using four chemiluminescence immunoassay systems.

Methods50 patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection and 130 controls without corona virus infection from the General Hospital of Chongqing were enrolled in current retrospective study. Four chemiluminescence immunoassay systems including seven IgM/IgG antibody detection Kits for 2019-nCoV (A_IgM, A_IgG, B_IgM, B_IgG, C_IgM, C_IgG, D_Ab) were employed to detecting antibody concentration. Chi-square test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Youdens index were demonstrated to verify the cutoff value of each detection system.

ResultsThe repeatability verification results of the A, B, C, and D system are all qualified. D-Ab performances best (92% sensitivity and 99.23% specificity), and B_IgM worse than other systems. Except for the system of A_IgM and C_IgG, the optimal diagnostic thresholds and cutoff value of other kits from recommendations are inconsistent with each other. B_IgM got the worst AUC and C_IgG had the best diagnostic accuracy. More importantly, B_IgG system have the highest false positive rate for testing patients with AIDS, tumor and pregnant. A_IgM system test showed highest false positive rates among elder over 90 years old.

ConclusionsSystems for CoVID-2019 IgM/IgG antibody test performance difference.

7736,Almitrine as a non ventilatory strategy to improve intrapulmonary shunt in COVID-19 patients,"In severe COVID-19 pulmonary failure, hypoxia is mainly related to pulmonary vasodilation with altered hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). Besides prone positioning, other non-ventilatory strategies may reduce the intrapulmonary shunt. This study has investigated almitrine, a pharmacological option to improve oxygenation.

Patients and Method. A case control series of 17 confirmed COVID-19 mechanically ventilated patients in prone or supine positioning was collected: 10 patients received two doses of almitrine (4 and 12 mcg/kg/min) at 30-45 min interval each, and were compared to 7 """"control"""" COVID-matched patients conventionally treated. The end-point was the reduction of intra-pulmonary shunt increasing the PaO2 and ScvO2.

Results Patients were male (59%) with median (25th, 75th percentiles) age of 70 (54-78) years and a BMI of 29 (23-34). At stable mechanical ventilatory settings, PaO2 (mmHg) at FiO2 1 (135 (85, 195) to 214 (121, 275); p = 0.06) tended to increase with almitrine. This difference was significant when the best PaO2 between the 2 doses was used: 215 (123,294) vs baseline (p = 0.01). A concomitant increase in ScvO2 occurred ((73 (72, 76) to 82 (80, 87); p = 0.02). Eight over 10 almitrine-treated patients increased their PaO2, with no clear dose-effect. During the same time, the controls did not change PaO2.

In conclusion, in early COVID-19 with severe hypoxemia, almitrine infusion is associated with improved oxygenation in prone or supine positioning. This pharmacological intervention may offer an alternative and/or an additional effect to proning and might delay or avoid more demanding modalities such as ECMO.","Losser, M.

1736,"Distribution of the 2019-nCoV Epidemic and Correlation with Population Emigration from Wuhan, China","BACKGROUNDSThe ongoing new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia outbreak is spreading in China and has not reached its peak. Five millions of people had emigrated from Wuhan before the city lockdown, which potentially represent a source of virus spreaders. Case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in early epidemic are of great importance for early warning and prevention of future outbreak.

METHODSThe officially reported cases of 2019-nCoV pneumonia were collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location information of these cases were extracted analyzed with ArcGIS and WinBUGS. Population migration data of Wuhan City and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi and analyzed for their correlation with case number.

FINDINGSThe 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases were predominantly distributed in Hubei and other provinces of South China. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan provinces that are adjacent to Hubei. While Wuhan city has the highest number of cases, the time risk is relatively stable. Numbers of cases in some cities are relatively low, but the time risks are continuously rising. The case numbers of different provinces and cities of Hubei province were highly correlated with the emigrated populations from Wuhan. Lockdown of 19 cities of Hubei province, and implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented the exponential growth of case number.

INTERPRETATIONPopulation emigrated from Wuhan was the main infection source for other cities and provinces. Some cities with low case number but were in rapid increase. Due to the upcoming Spring Festival return transport wave, understanding of the trends of risks in different regions is of great significance for preparedness for both individuals and institutions.

MethodsFrom May 11 until June 11, 2020, 3,981 HCWs at a large Swedish Emergency Care hospital provided serum samples and questionnaire data. Exposure was measured by assaying IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.

ResultsThe total seroprevalence was 17.7% and increased during the study period. Among the seropositive HCWs, 10.5% had been entirely asymptomatic. Participants who worked with COVID-19 patients had higher odds for seropositivity: ORadj 1.96 (95% CI 1.59 - 2.42). HCWs from three of the departments managing COVID-19 patients had significantly higher seroprevalences, whereas the prevalence among HCWs from the Intensive Care Unit (also managing COVID-19 patients) was significantly lower.

12483,Resveratrol and Copper for treatment of severe COVID-19: an observational study (RESCU 002),"BackgroundTo be universally applicable in treatment of severe COVID-19, novel therapies, especially those with little toxicity and low cost, are urgently needed. We report here the use of one such therapeutic combination involving two commonly used nutraceuticals, namely resveratrol and copper in patients with this disease. This study was prompted by pre-clinical reports that sepsis-related cytokine storm and fatality in mice can be prevented by oral administration of small quantities of resveratrol and copper. Since cytokine storm and sepsis are major causes of death in severe COVID-19, we retrospectively analyzed outcomes of patients with this condition who had received resveratrol and copper.

Methods & FindingsOur analysis comprised of 230 patients with severe COVID-19 requiring inhaled oxygen who were admitted in a single tertiary care hospital in Mumbai between April 1 and May 13 2020. Thirty of these patients received, in addition to standard care, resveratrol and copper at doses of 5.6 mg and 560 ng, respectively, orally, once every 6 hours, until discharge or death. These doses were based on our pre-clinical studies, and were nearly 50 times and 2000 times less, respectively, than those recommended as health supplements. A multivariable-adjusted analysis was used to model the outcome of death in these patients and evaluate factors associated with this event. A binary logistic regression analysis was used, with age, sex, presence of comorbidities and receipt of resveratrol-copper as covariates. Data were updated as of May 30 2020. The number of deaths in resveratrol-copper and standard care only groups were 7/30 (23.3%, 95% CI 8.1%-38.4%) and 89/200 (44.5%, 95% CI 37.6%-51.3%), respectively. In multivariable analysis, age >50 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.558, 95% CI 1.454-4.302, P=0.0011] and female sex (OR 1.939, 95% CI 1.079-3.482, P=0.0267) were significantly associated, while presence of co-morbidities was not significantly associated (OR 0.713, 95% CI 0.405-1.256, P=0.2421) with death. There was a trend towards reduction in death in patients receiving resveratrol-copper (OR 0.413, 95% CI 0.164-1.039, P= 0.0604).

ConclusionsWe provide preliminary results of a novel approach to the treatment of severe COVID-19 using a combination of small amounts of commonly used nutraceuticals, which is non-toxic and inexpensive, and therefore could be widely accessible globally. The nearly two-fold reduction in mortality with resveratrol-copper observed in our study needs to be confirmed in a randomized controlled trial.","Mittra, I.; De Souza, R.; Bhadade, R.; Madke, T.; Shankpal, P.

The key features of our model are the timing of implementation of major public policies restricting social movement, the identification and isolation of unreported cases, and the impact of asymptomatic infectious cases.","Liu, Z.; Magal, P.; Seydi, O.; Webb, G.",2020-03-13,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.11.20034314,1,Glenn Webb,Vanderbilt University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20034314v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20034314v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3934/mbe.2020172
3759,Efficient and Practical Sample Pooling for High-Throughput PCR Diagnosis of COVID-19,"In the global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, governments and public health agencies are striving to rapidly increase the volume and rate of diagnostic testing. The most common form of testing today employs Polymerase Chain Reaction in order to identify the presence of viral RNA in individual patient samples one by one. This process has become one of the most significant bottlenecks to increased testing, especially due to reported shortages in the chemical reagents needed in the PCR reaction.

Recent technical advances have enabled High-Throughput PCR, in which multiple samples are pooled into one tube. Such methods can be highly efficient, saving large amounts of time and reagents. However, their efficiency is highly dependent on the frequency of positive samples, which varies significantly across regions and even within regions as testing criterion and conditions change.

Here, we present two possible optimized pooling strategies for diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 testing on large scales, both addressing dynamic conditions. In the first, we employ a simple information-theoretic heuristic to derive a highly efficient re-pooling protocol: an estimate of the target frequency determines the initial pool size, and any subsequent pools found positive are re-pooled at half-size and tested again. In the range of very rare target (<0.05), this approach can reduce the number of necessary tests dramatically, for example, achieving a reduction by a factor of 50 for a target frequency of 0.001. The second method is a simpler approach of optimized one-time pooling followed by individual tests on positive pools. We show that this approach is just as efficient for moderate target-product frequencies (0.05<0.2), for example, achieving a two-fold in the number of when the frequency of positive samples is 0.07.

These strategies require little investment, and they offer a significant reduction in the amount of materials, equipment and time needed to test large numbers of samples. We show that both these pooling strategies are roughly comparable to the absolute upper-bound efficiency given by Shannons source coding theorem. We compare our strategies to the naive way of testing and to alternative matrix-pooling methods. Most importantly, we offer straightforward, practical pooling instructions for laboratories that perform large scale PCR assays to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. These two pooling strategies may offer ways to alleviate the bottleneck currently preventing massive expansion of SARS-CoV-2 testing around the world.","Shani-Narkiss, H.; Gilday, O.

18291,Clinico-pathological features in fatal Covid-19 Infection: A Preliminary Experience of a Tertiary Care Centre in North India using Post-Mortem Minimally Invasive Tissue Biopsies,"BackgroundThe Covid-19 pandemic began in China in December 2019. India is the second most affected country, as of November 2020 with more than 8.5million cases. Covid-19 infection primarily involves the lung with severity of illness varying from influenza-like illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Other organs have also found to be variably affected. Studies evaluating the histopathological changes of Covid-19 are critical in providing a better understanding of the disease pathophysiology and guiding treatment. Minimally invasive biopsy techniques (MITS/B) provide an easy and suitable alternative to complete autopsies. In this prospective single center study we present the histopathological examination of 37 patients who died with complications of Covid-19.

MethodsThis was an observational study conducted in the Intensive Care Unit of JPN Trauma Centre AIIMS. A total of 37 patients who died of Covid-19 were enrolled in the study. Post-mortem percutaneous biopsies were taken by the help of surface landmarking/ultrasonography guidance from lung, heart, liver, and kidneys; after obtaining ethical consent. The biopsy samples were then stained with haematoxylin and eosin stain. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using CD61 and CD163 in all lung cores. SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected using IHC with primary antibodies in selected samples. Details regarding demographics, clinical parameters, hospital course, treatment details, and laboratory investigations were also collected for clinical correlation.

ResultsA total of 37 patients underwent post-mortem minimally invasive tissue sampling. Mean age of the patients was 48.7years and 59.5% of them were males. Respiratory failure was the most common complication seen in 97.3%. Lung histopathology showed acute lung injury and diffuse alveolar damage in 78% patients. Associated bronchopneumonia was seen in 37.5% patients and scattered microthrombi were visualised in 21% patients. Immunostaining with CD61 and CD163 highlighted megakaryocytes, and increased macrophages in all samples. Immunopositivity for SARS-CoV-2 was observed in Type II pneumocytes. Acute tubular injury with epithelial vacuolization was seen in 46% of the renal biopsies but none of them showed evidence of microvascular thrombosis. 71% of the liver tissue cores showed evidence of Kupfer cell hyperplasia. 27.5% had evidence of submassive hepatic necrosis and 14% had features of acute on chronic liver failure. All the heart biopsies showed non-specific features such as hypertrophy with nucleomegaly with no evidence of myocardial necrosis in any of the samples.

ConclusionsThe most common finding in this cohort is the diffuse alveolar damage with demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 protein in the acute phase of DAD. Microvascular thrombi were rarely identified in the lung, liver and kidney. Substantial hepatocyte necrosis, hepatocyte degeneration, Kupffer cell hypertrophy, micro, and macrovesicular steatosis unrelated to microvascular thrombi suggests that liver might be a primary target of Covid-19. This study highlights the importance of MITS/B in better understanding the pathological changes associated with Covid-19.","Ray, A.; Jain, D.; Agarwal, S.; Swaroop, S.; Goel, A.; Das, P.; Arava, S.

28205,Increased LPS levels coexist with systemic inflammation and result in monocyte activation in severe COVID-19 patients.,"This study aimed to evaluate the link between microbial translocation markers and systemic inflammation at the earliest time-point after hospitalization and at the last 72 h of hospitalization in survivors and non-survivors COVID-19 patients. Sixty-six SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR+ infected patients and nine non-COVID-19 pneumonia controls were admitted in this study. Blood samples were collected at hospital admission (T1) (Controls and COVID-19+ patients) and 0-72 h before hospital discharge (T2, alive or dead) to analyze systemic cytokines and chemokines, LPS concentrations and soluble CD14 (sCD14) levels. THP-1 human monocytic cell line was incubated with plasma from survivors and non-survivors COVID-19 patients and their phenotype, activation status, TLR4, and chemokine receptors were analyzed by flow cytometry. COVID-19 patients presented higher IL-6, IFN-{gamma}, TNF-, TGF-{beta}1, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL4/MIP-1{beta}, and CCL5/RANTES levels than controls. Moreover, LPS and sCD14 were higher at hospital admission in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Non-survivors COVID-19 patients had increased LPS levels concomitant with higher IL-6, TNF-, CCL2/MCP-1, and CCL5/RANTES levels at T2. Increased expression of CD16 and CCR5 were identified in THP-1 cells incubated with the plasma of survivor patients obtained at T2. The incubation of THP-1 with T2 plasma of non-survivors COVID-19 leads to higher TLR4, CCR2, CCR5, CCR7, and CD69 expression. In conclusion, increased microbial translocation during hospitalization coexist with the inflammatory condition of SARS-CoV-2 infection and could lead to higher monocyte activation in non-survivors COVID-19 patients.","Teixeira, P.

25991,Pre-pandemic mental and physical health as predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy: evidence from a UK-wide cohort study,"ImportanceAlthough several predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy have been identified, the role of physical health has not been well-examined, and the association with mental health is unknown.

ObjectiveTo examine the association of pre-pandemic mental health, physical health, and shielding with vaccine hesitancy after the announcement of the successful testing of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe used individual-level data from a pandemic-focused investigation (COVID Survey), a prospective cohort study nested within the UK Understanding Society (Main Survey) project. In the week immediately following the announcement of successful testing of the first efficacious inoculation (November/December 2020), data on vaccine intentionality were collected in 12,035 individuals aged 16-95 years. Pre-pandemic, study members had responded to enquiries about diagnoses of mental and physical health, completed the 12-item General Health Questionnaire for symptoms of psychological distress (anxiety and depression), and indicated whether they or someone in their household was shielding.

Main outcome measuresSelf-reported intention to take up a vaccination for COVID-19. To summarise our results, we computed odds ratios with accompanying 95% confidence intervals for indices of health and shielding adjusted for selected covariates.

ResultsIn an analytical sample of 11,955 people (6741 women), 15.4% indicated that they were vaccine hesitant. Relative to their disease-free counterparts, shielding was associated with a 24% lower risk of being hesitant (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 0.76; 0.59, 0.96), after adjustment for a range of covariates which included age, education, and ethnicity. Corresponding results for cardiometabolic disease were 22% (0.78; 0.64, 0.95), and for respiratory disease were 26% (0.74; 0.59, 0.93). Having a pre-pandemic diagnosis of anxiety or depression, or a high score on the distress symptom scale, were all unrelated to the willingness to take up a vaccine.

Conclusions and relevancePeople who have been prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination owing to a physical condition are more likely to take it up. These effects were not apparent for indices of mental health.","Batty, G.

20301,REAL-TIME MECHANISTIC BAYESIAN FORECASTS OF COVID-19 MORTALITY,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe COVID-19 pandemic emerged in late December 2019. In the first six months of the global outbreak, the US reported more cases and deaths than any other country in the world. Effective modeling of the course of the pandemic can help assist with public health resource planning, intervention efforts, and vaccine clinical trials. However, building applied forecasting models presents unique challenges during a pandemic. First, case data available to models in real-time represent a non-stationary fraction of the true case incidence due to changes in available diagnostic tests and test-seeking behavior. Second, interventions varied across time and geography leading to large changes in transmissibility over the course of the pandemic. We propose a mechanistic Bayesian model (MechBayes) that builds upon the classic compartmental susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model to operationalize COVID-19 forecasting in real time. This framework includes non-parametric modeling of varying transmission rates, non-parametric modeling of case and death discrepancies due to testing and reporting issues, and a joint observation likelihood on new case counts and new deaths; it is implemented in a probabilistic programming language to automate the use of Bayesian reasoning for quantifying uncertainty in probabilistic forecasts. The model has been used to submit forecasts to the US Centers for Disease Control, through the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. We examine the performance relative to a baseline model as well as alternate models submitted to the Forecast Hub. Additionally, we include an ablation test of our extensions to the classic SEIR model. We demonstrate a significant gain in both point and probabilistic forecast scoring measures using MechBayes when compared to a baseline model and show that MechBayes ranks as one of the top 2 models out of 10 submitted to the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Finally, we demonstrate that MechBayes performs significantly better than the classical SEIR model.","Gibson, G. C.; Reich, N.

10128,THE USE OF DENATURING SOLUTION AS COLLECTION AND TRANSPORT MEDIA TO IMPROVE SARS-COV-2 RNA DETECTION AND REDUCE INFECTION OF LABORATORY PERSONNEL,"BackgroundSince the emergence of the COVID-19, health officials have struggled to devise strategies to counteract the speed of the pandemics spread across the globe. It became imperative to implement accurate diagnostic tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on respiratory samples. In many places, however, besides the limited availability of test reagents, laboratory personnel face the challenge of adapting their working routines to manipulate highly infective clinical samples. Here, we proposed the use of a virus-inactivating solution as part of a sample collection kit to decrease the infectious potential of the collected material without affecting the integrity of RNA samples used in diagnostic tests based on RT-qPCR.

MethodsNasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples were collected from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and from laboratory personnel using a commercially available viral transport solution (VTM) and the denaturing solution (DS) described here. RNA extracted from all samples was tested by RT-qPCR using probes for viral and human genes. Exposure of laboratory personnel to infective viruses was also accessed using ELISA tests.

FindingsThe use of the DS did not interfere with the detection of viral genome or the endogenous human mRNA, since similar results were obtained from samples collected with VTM or DS. In addition, all tests of laboratory personnel for the presence of viral RNA and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were negative.

InterpretationThe methodology described here provides a strategy that allow high diagnostic accuracy as well as safe manipulation of clinical samples by those involved with diagnostic procedures.

27625,A functionally distinct neutrophil landscape in severe COVID-19 reveals opportunities for adjunctive therapies,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening syndrome of respiratory failure and diffuse alveolar damage that results from dysregulated local and systemic immune activation, causing pulmonary vascular, parenchymal and alveolar damage. SARS-CoV-2 infection has become the dominant cause of ARDS worldwide, and emerging evidence implicates neutrophils and their cytotoxic arsenal of effector functions as central drivers of immune-mediated lung injury in COVID-19 ARDS. However, a key outstanding question is whether COVID-19 drives a unique program of neutrophil activation or effector functions that contributes to the severe pathogenesis of this pandemic illness, and whether this unique neutrophil response can be targeted to attenuate disease. Using a combination of high-dimensional single cell analysis and ex vivo functional assays of neutrophils from patients with COVID-19 ARDS compared to non-COVID ARDS (caused by bacterial pneumonia), we identified a functionally distinct landscape of neutrophil activation in COVID-19 ARDS that was intrinsically programmed during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, neutrophils in COVID-19 ARDS were functionally primed to produce high amounts of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Surprisingly, this unique pathological program of neutrophil priming escaped conventional therapy with dexamethasone, thereby revealing a promising target for adjunctive immunotherapy in severe COVID-19.","Panda, R.; Castanheira, F.

7104,COVID-19 In Shang Hai: It is Worth Learning from the Successful Experience in Preventing and Controlling the Overseas Epidemic Situation,"COVID-19 first appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in late December 2019 and spread rapidly in China. Currently, the spread of local epidemics has been basically blocked. The import of overseas epidemics has become the main form of growth in Chinas new epidemic. As an important international transportation hub in China, Shanghai is one of the regions with the highest risk of imported cases abroad. Due to imported of overseas cases are affected by the international epidemic trend. The traditional infectious disease model is difficult to accurately predict the cumulative trend of cumulative cases in the Shanghai areas. It is also difficult to accurately evaluate the effectiveness of the international traffic blockade. In this situation, this study takes Shanghai as an example to propose a new type of infectious disease prediction model. The model first uses the sparse graph model to analyze the international epidemic spread network to find countries and regions related to Shanghai. Next, multiple regression models were used to fit the existing COV-19 growth data in Shanghai. Finally, the model can predict the growth curve of Shanghais epidemic without blocking traffic. The results show that the control measures taken by Shanghai are very effective. At present, more and more countries and regions will face the current situation in Shanghai. We recommend that other countries and regions learn from Shanghais successful experience in preventing overseas imports in order to fully prepare for epidemic prevention and control.","Dang, Q.; Rui, M.; Yong, L.",2020-05-16,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.05.13.20100164,1,Liang Yong,"State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicines, Macau University of Science and Techn",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.20100164v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.20100164v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
4857,Prioritisation of potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug repurposing opportunities based on ability to achieve adequate target site concentrations derived from their established human pharmacokinetics,"There is a rapidly expanding literature on the in vitro antiviral activity of drugs that may be repurposed for therapy or chemoprophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. However, this has not been accompanied by a comprehensive evaluation of the ability of these drugs to achieve target plasma and lung concentrations following approved dosing in humans. Moreover, most publications have focussed on 50% maximum effective concentrations (EC50), which may be an insufficiently robust indicator of antiviral activity because of marked differences in the slope of the concentration-response curve between drugs. Accordingly, in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity data was digitised from all available publications up to 13th April 2020 and used to recalculate an EC90 value for each drug. EC90 values were then expressed as a ratio to the achievable maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) reported for each drug after administration of the approved dose to humans (Cmax/EC90 ratio). Only 14 of the 56 analysed drugs achieved a Cmax/EC90 ratio above 1 meaning that plasma Cmax concentrations exceeded those necessary to inhibit 90% of SARS-CoV-2 replication. A more in-depth assessment of the putative agents tested demonstrated that only nitazoxanide, nelfinavir, tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir) and sulfadoxine achieved plasma concentrations above their reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity across their entire approved dosing interval at their approved human dose. For all drugs reported, the unbound lung to plasma tissue partition coefficient (KpUlung) was also simulated and used along with reported Cmax and fraction unbound in plasma to derive a lung Cmax/EC50 as a better indicator of potential human efficacy (lung Cmax/EC90 ratio was also calculable for a limited number of drugs). Using this parameter hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, mefloquine, atazanavir (boosted with ritonavir), tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir), ivermectin, azithromycin and lopinavir (boosted with ritonavir) were all predicted to achieve lung concentrations over 10-fold higher than their reported EC50. This analysis was not possible for nelfinavir because insufficient data were available to calculate KpUlung but nitozoxanide and sulfadoxine were also predicted to exceed their reported EC50 by 3.1- and 1.5-fold in lung, respectively. The antiviral activity data reported to date have been acquired under different laboratory conditions across multiple groups, applying variable levels of stringency. However, this analysis may be used to select potential candidates for further clinical testing, while deprioritising compounds which are unlikely to attain target concentrations for antiviral activity. Future studies should focus on EC90 values and discuss findings in the context of achievable exposures in humans, especially within target compartments such as the lung, in order to maximise the potential for success of proposed human clinical trials.","Arshad, U.; Pertinez, H.; Box, H.; Tatham, L.; Rajoli, R.

27635,Adaptive vaccination may be needed to eliminate COVID-19: Results from a runtime-alterable strain-drift and waning-immunity model,"We developed an elaborated susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) individual-based model (IBM) with pathogen strain drift, waning and cross immunity, implemented as a novel Java Runtime-Alterable-Model Platform (J-RAMP). This platform allows parameter values, process formulations, and scriptable runtime drivers to be easily added at the start of simulation. It includes facility for integration into the R statistical and other data analysis platforms. We selected a set of parameter values and process descriptions relevant to the current COVID-19 pandemic. These include pathogen-specific shedding, environmental persistence, host transmission and mortality, within-host pathogen mutation and replication, adaptive social distancing, and time dependent vaccine rate and strain valency specifications. Our simulations illustrate that if waning immunity outpaces vaccination rates, then vaccination rollouts may fail to contain the most transmissible strains. Our study highlights the need for adaptive vaccination rollouts, which depend on reliable real-time monitoring and surveillance of strain proliferation and reinfection data needed to ensure that vaccines target emerging strains and constrain escape mutations. Together with such data, our platform has the potential to inform the design of vaccination programs that eliminate rather than exacerbate local outbreaks. Finally, our RAMP concept promotes the development of highly flexible models that can be easily shared among researchers and policymakers not only addressing healthcare crises, but other types of environmental crises as well.

Significance StatementEffective COVID-19 vaccine development has been unprecedented, but vaccinations are being delivered at contrasting rates across the globe. Here, using an innovative epidemiological Java runtime alterable modeling platform (J-RAMP), we demonstrate that seemingly reasonable vaccination programs may exacerbate rather than mitigate regional outbreaks when immune waning outpaces vaccinations and reinfection promotes escape mutations. Our simulations suggest that adaptive vaccination programs, requiring adequate strain and serology monitoring and surveillance, are needed to eliminate outbreaks. Our platform provides policymakers with an easy-to-use tool for designing effective vaccination programs. Our RAMP concept points the way to the development of highly flexible models that are easily shared among researchers and policymakers in all areas of systems analysis.","Getz, W.

7678,Clinical predictors of COVID-19 mortality,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected over millions of individuals and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide.

It can be difficult to accurately predict mortality among COVID-19 patients presenting with a spectrum of complications, hindering the prognostication and management of the disease.

MethodsWe applied machine learning techniques to clinical data from a large cohort of 5,051 COVID-19 patients treated at the Mount Sinai Health System in New

York City, the global COVID-19 epicenter, to predict mortality. Predictors were designed to classify patients into Deceased or Alive mortality classes and were evaluated in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC score).

FindingsUsing a development cohort (n=3,841) and a systematic machine learning framework, we identified a COVID-19 mortality predictor that demonstrated high accuracy (AUC=0{middle dot}91) when applied to test sets of retrospective (n= 961) and prospective (n=249) patients. This mortality predictor was based on five clinical features: age, minimum O2 saturation during encounter, type of patient encounter (inpatient vs. various types of outpatient and telehealth encounters), hydroxychloroquine use, and maximum body temperature.

InterpretationAn accurate and parsimonious COVID-19 mortality predictor based on five features may have utility in clinical settings to guide the management and prognostication of patients affected by this disease.

27266,Clarity Plus™ digital PCR: A novel platform for absolute quantification of SARS-CoV-2,"In recent years, the usage of digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) for various clinical applications has increased exponentially. Considering the growing demand for improved dPCR technology, the Clarity Plus dPCR system which features enhanced multiplexing capability and a wider dynamic range for nucleic acid analysis was recently launched. In this study, a dPCR assay optimized for use on Clarity Plus was evaluated for the absolute quantification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent responsible for the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. The assay demonstrated good inter- and intra-assay precision, accuracy, as well as excellent linearity across a range of over 6 orders of magnitude for target gene quantification. In addition, comparison of the assay on both dPCR and qPCR platforms revealed that dPCR exhibited a slightly higher sensitivity compared to its qPCR counterpart when quantifying SARS-CoV-2 at a lower concentration. Overall, the results showed that the dPCR assay is a reliable and effective approach for the absolute quantification of SARS-CoV-2 and can potentially be adopted as a molecular tool for detecting low viral load in patients and wastewater surveillance of COVID-19.","Tan, S.

10903,Chopping the tail: how preventing superspreading can help to maintain COVID-19 control,"Disease transmission is notoriously heterogeneous, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. A skewed distribution where few individuals or events are responsible for the majority of transmission can result in explosive, superspreading events, which produce rapid and volatile epidemic dynamics, especially early or late in epidemics. Anticipating and preventing superspreading events can produce large reductions in overall transmission rates. Here, we present a compartmental (SEIR) epidemiological model framework for estimating transmission parameters from multiple imperfectly observed data streams, including reported cases, deaths, and mobile phone-based mobility that incorporates individual-level heterogeneity in transmission using previous estimates for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. We parameterize the model for COVID-19 epidemic dynamics by estimating a time-varying transmission rate that incorporates the impact of non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies that change over time, in five epidemiologically distinct settings--Los Angeles and Santa Clara Counties, California; Seattle (King County), Washington; Atlanta (Dekalb and Fulton Counties), Georgia; and Miami (Miami-Dade County), Florida. We find the effective reproduction number [R]E dropped below 1 rapidly following social distancing orders in mid-March, 2020 and remained there into June in Santa Clara County and Seattle, but climbed above 1 in late May in Los Angeles, Miami, and Atlanta, and has trended upward in all locations since April. With the fitted model, we ask: how does truncating the tail of the individual-level transmission rate distribution affect epidemic dynamics and control? We find interventions that truncate the transmission rate distribution while partially relaxing social distancing are broadly effective, with impacts on epidemic growth on par with the strongest population-wide social distancing observed in April, 2020. Given that social distancing interventions will be needed to maintain epidemic control until a vaccine becomes widely available, """"chopping off the tail"""" to reduce the probability of superspreading events presents a promising option to alleviate the need for extreme general social distancing.","Kain, M.

5807,Control with uncertain data of socially structured compartmental epidemic models,"The adoption of containment measures to reduce the amplitude of the epidemic peak is a key aspect in tackling the rapid spread of an epidemic. Classical compartmental models must be modified and studied to correctly describe the effects of forced external actions to reduce the impact of the disease. In addition, data are often incomplete and heterogeneous, so a high degree of uncertainty must naturally be incorporated into the models. In this work we address both these aspects, through an optimal control formulation of the epidemiological model in presence of uncertain data. After the introduction of the optimal control problem, we formulate an instantaneous approximation of the control that allows us to derive new feedback controlled compartmental models capable of describing the epidemic peak reduction. The need for long-term interventions shows that alternative actions based on the social structure of the system can be as effective as the more expensive global strategy. The importance of the timing and intensity of interventions is particularly relevant in the case of uncertain parameters on the actual number of infected people. Simulations related to data from the recent COVID-19 outbreak in Italy are presented and discussed.","Albi, G.; Pareschi, L.; Zanella, M.",2020-05-02,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.27.20081885,1,Mattia Zanella,University of Pavia,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.27.20081885v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.27.20081885v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1007/s00285-021-01617-y
13747,Urban Sprawl of Covid-19 Epidemic in India: Lessons in the First Semester,"Background & ObjectiveThe covid-19 epidemic is rapidly escalating in India and unlike developed countries there is no evidence of plateau or decline in the past 6 months. To evaluate association of state-level sociodemographics with incident cases and deaths we performed an ecological study.

MethodsPublicly available data sources were used. Absolute number of covid-19 cases and deaths were obtained and cases and deaths/million in each state calculated from February to July 2020. To assess association of state level disease burden with sociodemographic variables (urbanization, human development, healthcare availability, healthcare access and quality etc.) we determined Pearsons correlation and logarithmic trends.

ResultsCovid-19 in India has led to >2,000,000 cases and 45,000 deaths by end July 2020. There is large variation in state-level cases/million ranging from 7247 (Delhi), 3728 (Goa) and 3427 (Maharashtra) to less than 300/million in a few. Deaths/million range from 212 (Delhi), 122 (Maharashtra) and 51 (Tamilnadu) to 2 in north-eastern states. Most of the high burden states (except Delhi) are reporting increasing burden and deaths with the largest increase in July 2020. There is a significant positive correlation of urbanization with covid-19 cases (r=0.65, R2=0.35) and deaths (r=0.60, R2=0.28) and weaker correlation with other sociodemographic variables. From March to July 2020, stable R2 value for urbanization is observed with cases (0.37 to 0.39) while it is increasing for deaths (0.10 to 0.28).

ConclusionsCovid-19 epidemic is escalating in India and cases as well as deaths are significantly greater in more urbanized states. Prevention, control and treatment should focus on urban health systems.","Gupta, R.; Dhamija, R. K.; Gaur, K.; Khedar, R.

11762,Progressive worsening of the respiratory and gut microbiome in children during the first two months of COVID-19,"Children are less susceptible to COVID-19 and manifests lower morbidity and mortality after infection, for which a multitude of mechanisms may be proposed. Whether the normal development of gut-airway microbiome is affected by COVID-19 has not been evaluated. We demonstrate that COVID-19 alters the respiratory and gut microbiome of children. Alteration of the microbiome was divergent between the respiratory tract and gut, albeit the dysbiosis was dominated by genus Pseudomonas and sustained for up to 25-58 days in different individuals. The respiratory microbiome distortion persisted in 7/8 children for at least 19-24 days after discharge from the hospital. The gut microbiota showed early dysbiosis towards later restoration in some children, but not others. Disturbed development of both gut and respiratory microbiomes, and prolonged respiratory dysbiosis in children imply possible long-term complications after clinical recovery from COVID-19, such as predisposition to an increased health risk in the post-COVID-19 era.","Xu, R.; Liu, P.; Zhang, T.; Wu, Q.; Zeng, M.; Ma, Y.; Jin, X.; Xu, J.; Zhang, Z.; Zhang, C.",2020-07-17,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.07.13.20152181,1,Chiyu Zhang,Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152181v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152181v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
13829,Effects of (Un)lockdown on COVID-19 transmission: A mathematical study of different phases in India,"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), identified in China at the end of the December 2019 is causing a potentially fatal respiratory syndrome (COVID-19), has meanwhile led to outbreak all over the globe. India has now become the third worst hit country globally with 16,38,870 confirmed cases and 35,747 confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 as of 31 July 2020. In this paper we have used mathematical modelling approach to study the effects of lockdowns and un-lockdowns on the pandemic evolution in India. This, study is based on SIDHARTHE model, which is an extension of classical SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model. The SIDHARTHE model distinguish between the diagnosed and undiagnosed cases, which is very important because undiagnosed individuals are more likely to spread the virus than diagnosed individuals. We have stratified the lockdowns and un-lockdowns into seven phases and have computed the basic reproduction number R0 for each phase. We have calibrated our model results with real data from 20 March 2020 to 31 July 2020. Our results demonstrate that different strategies implemented by GoI, have delayed the peak of pandemic by approximately 100 days. But due to underdiagnosis of the infected asymptomatic subpopulation, a sudden outbreak of cases can be observed in India.","Kumar, R.; Malik, M. Z.; Shah, S.

18391,Nasopharyngeal Panbio COVID-19 antigen performed at point-of-care has a high sensitivity in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with higher risk for transmission and older age,"BackgroundPerformance of point-of-care tests in clinical practice remains undetermined. We aimed to evaluate the performance of the nasopharyngeal Panbio COVID-19 antigen Rapid Test Device in real-life conditions in different clinical scenarios.

MethodProspective study conducted in three primary care centers (PCC) and an emergency department. The antigen test was performed at point-of-care in nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs, and in saliva. Positive and negative percent agreement (PPA, NPA) were calculated with the RT-PCR assay as reference standard.

ResultsOf 913 patients included, 296 (32.3%) were asymptomatic and 690 (75.6%) came from the PCC. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 913, nasal swabs from 659, and saliva from 611 patients. RT-PCR was positive in 196 (21.5%) nasopharyngeal samples (NPS). Overall PPA (95% CI) in NPS was 60.5% (53.3-67.4), and it was lower in nasal swabs (44.7%) and saliva (23.1%). Test performance in NPS was largely dependent on the cycle threshold (Ct) in RT-PCR, with PPA>90% for Ct[&le;]25 and [&ge;]80% for Ct<30. In symptomatic patients, the PPA was 95% for Ct[&le;]25; [&ge;]85% for Ct<30, and 89% for the symptom triad of fever, cough and malaise. Performance was also dependent on age, with PPA of 100% in symptomatic patients >50 years with Ct<25. In asymptomatic patients, the PPA was 86% for Ct<25. In all cases, NPA was 100%.

ConclusionThe nasopharyngeal Panbio COVID-19 antigen test performed at point-of-care is highly sensitive in symptomatic patients, particularly with Ct<30 and older age. The test was useful to identify asymptomatic patients with lower Ct values and therefore with contagious risk.

5234,Modelling the potential impact of social distancing on the COVID-19 epidemic in South Africa,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to be a global health problem whose impact has been significantly felt in South Africa. Social distancing has been touted as the best form of response in managing a rapid increase in the number of infected cases. In this paper, we present a deterministic model to model the impact of social distancing on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in South Africa. The model is fitted to the currently available data on the cumulative number of infected cases and a scenario analysis on different levels of social distancing are presented. The results show a continued rise in the number of cases in the lock down period with the current levels of social distancing albeit at a lower rate. The model shows that the number of cases will rise to above 4000 cases by the end of the lockdown. The model also looks at the impact of relaxing the social distancing measures after the initial announcement of the lock down measures. A relaxation of the social distancing by 2% can result in a 23% rise in the number of cumulative cases while on the other hand increasing the levels of social distancing by 2% would reduce the number of cumulative cases by about 18%. These results have implications on the management and policy direction in the early phases of the epidemic.","Nyabadza, F.; Chirove, F.; Chukwu, W. C.; Visaya, M.

8535,"Spread of COVID-19 through Georgia, USA. Near-term projections and impacts of social distancing via a metapopulation model","Epidemiological forecasts of COVID-19 spread at the country and/or state level have helped shape public health interventions. However, such models leave a scale-gap between the spatial resolution of actionable information (i.e. the county or city level) and that of modeled viral spread. States and nations are not spatially homogeneous and different areas may vary in disease risk and severity. For example, COVID-19 has age-stratified risk. Similarly, ICU units, PPE and other vital equipment are not equally distributed within states. Here, we implement a county-level epidemiological framework to assess and forecast COVID-19 spread through Georgia, where 1,933 people have died from COVID-19 and 44,638 cases have been documented as of May 27, 2020. We find that county-level forecasts trained on heterogeneity due to clustered events can continue to predict epidemic spread over multiweek periods, potentially serving efforts to prepare medical resources, manage supply chains, and develop targeted public health interventions. We find that the premature removal of physical (social) distancing could lead to rapid increases in cases or the emergence of sustained plateaus of elevated fatalities.

HighlightsO_LIContact heterogeneity and age-structured risk is represented in a metapopulation model.
C_LIO_LIThe metapopulation model can be used in the near-term to make joint predictions on cases, hospitalizations, and fatalities at county levels.

A retrospective cohort study from India","Background & AimWHO listed vaccine hesitancy among the top 10 global threats to health and there are very few reports highlighting vaccine benefits against COVID-19. The aim of this study was to study the impact of vaccination on reducing the average length of stay (ALOS), intensive care unit (ICU) requirement, mortality and cost of the treatment among COVID-19 patients.

MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study all the patients above 45 years who underwent treatment for COVID-19 were included. The data of patients treated pan India during the period March & April 2021 with the diagnosis of COVID-19, under health insurance cover, were extracted to study parameters like the ALOS, mortality, ICU requirement, total hospital expenses incurred and the vaccination status.

ResultsAmong 3820 patients with COVID-19, 3301 (86.4%) were unvaccinated while 519 (13.6%) were vaccinated. Among the unvaccinated the mean (s.d) ALOS was 7 days. Fourteen days after second dose of vaccination this was significantly less (p=0.01) at 4.9. The mean total hospital expense among the unvaccinated was Rs. 277850. Fourteen days after second dose of vaccination this was further less (p=0.001) at Rs. 217850. Among the unvaccinated population 291/3301 (8.8%) required ICU and this was significantly less (p=0.03) at 31/519 (6%) among the vaccinated. Among those who received two doses of vaccination it was further less at 1/33 (3%). The mortality among unvaccinated patients was 16/3301 (0.5%) while there was no mortality among the vaccinated. Among those who received two doses of vaccination there was a 66% relative risk reduction in ICU stay and 81% relative risk reduction in mortality.

ConclusionsThere was a significant reduction in ALOS, ICU requirement, mortality & treatment cost in patients who had completed two doses of vaccination.

8189,COVID-19 in Bangladesh: Measuring differences in individual precautionary behaviors among young adults,"AimThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already hit Bangladesh, and various control measures have been taken to flatten the epidemic curve. Due to the current demographic distribution in Bangladesh, young adults are vital to the demography of the country. Therefore, their precautionary behavior is very important to ensure the success of preventive policies. This exploratory study examined the differences in the adoption of precautionary behaviors among young adults, and estimated and compared the predictors of precautionary behavior adoption among young adults living in the capital city Dhaka and a nearby district, Tangail.

Subject and MethodsA total of 350 respondents from each district participated in the study. ANOVA and two-sample t-tests were utilized to detect differences in precautionary behavior across demographic groups of young adults, and quantile regression modeling was used to find the predictors of adopting precautionary behaviors and to compare these predictors between the two districts.

ResultsIndividuals who had a postgraduate education and had good mental health tended to show better precautionary behaviors in Dhaka. Female respondents from Tangail who had no psychological distress took precautionary behaviors more often than their counterparts. However, no significant differences in the adoption of precautionary behaviors to prevent COVID-19 among young adults were found between the two districts. Better self-control ability, higher education and good mental health emerged as factors that significantly shaped the precautionary behaviors of young adults in this study.

ConclusionHaving better knowledge did not ensure better adoption of precautionary behaviors among the participants. In effect, the governments strong intervention to keep people at home and distant from each other and continued lockdown for several more days are probable immediate solutions. At the same time, the economic burden on lower-income people should be addressed.","Imtiaz, A.; Hossain, M. A.; Khan, N.

2782,A framework for identifying regional outbreak and spread of COVID-19 from one-minute population-wide surveys,"Coronavirus infection spreads in clusters and therefore early identification of these clusters is critical for slowing down the spread of the virus. Here, we propose that daily population-wide surveys that assess the development of symptoms caused by the virus could serve as a strategic and valuable tool for identifying such clusters to inform epidemiologists, public health officials, and policy makers. We show preliminary results from a survey of over 58,000 Israelis and call for an international consortium to extend this concept in order to develop predictive models. We expect such data to allow: Faster detection of spreading zones and patients; Obtaining a current snapshot of the number of people in each area who have developed symptoms; Predicting future spreading zones several days before an outbreak occurs; Evaluating the effectiveness of the various social distancing measures taken, and their contribution to reduce the number of symptomatic people. Such information can provide a valuable tool for decision makers to decide which areas need strengthening of social distancing measures and which areas can be relieved. Preliminary analysis shows that in neighborhoods with confirmed COVID-19 patient history, more responders report on COVID-19 associated symptoms, demonstrating the potential utility of our approach for detection of outbreaks. Researchers from other countries including the U.S, India, Italy, Spain, Germany, Mexico, Finland, Sweden, Norway and several others have adopted our approach and we are collaborating to further improve it. We call with urgency for other countries to join this international consortium, and to share methods and data collected from these daily, simple, one-minute surveys.","Rossman, H.; Keshet, A.; Shilo, S.; Gavrieli, A.; Bauman, T.; Cohen, O.; Balicer, R.; Geiger, B.; Dor, Y.; Segal, E.",2020-03-27,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.19.20038844,2,Eran Segal,Weizmann Institute of Science,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038844v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038844v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.1038/s41591-020-0857-9
17717,A household case evidences shorter shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in naturally infected cats compared to their human owners.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been detected in domestic and wild cats. However, little is known about natural viral infections of domestic cats, although their importance for modeling disease spread, informing strategies for managing positive human-animal relationships and disease prevention. Here, we describe the SARS-CoV-2 infection in a household of two human adults and sibling cats (one male and two females) using real-time RT-PCR, an ELISA test, viral sequencing, and virus isolation. On May 2020, the cat- owners tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Two days later, the male cat showed mild respiratory symptoms and tested positive. Four days after the male cat, the two female cats became positive, asymptomatically. Also, one human and one cat showed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. All cats excreted detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA for a shorter duration than humans and viral sequences analysis confirmed human-to-cat transmission. We could not determine if cat-to-cat transmission also occurred.

24073,"Modelling the impact of rapid tests, tracing and distancing in lower-income countries suggest optimal policies varies with rural-urban settings","BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) remains the most reliable COVID-19 containment tool for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) given the inequality of vaccine distribution and their vulnerable healthcare systems. We aimed to develop mathematical models that capture LMIC demographic characteristics such as young population and large household size and assess NPI effectiveness in rural and urban communities.

MethodsWe constructed synthetic populations for rural, non-slum urban and slum settings to capture LMIC demographic characteristics that vary across communities. We integrated age mixing and household structure into contact networks for each community setting and simulated COVID-19 outbreaks within the networks. Using this agent-based model, we evaluate NPIs including testing and isolation, tracing and quarantine, and physical distancing. We explored the optimal containment strategies for rural and urban communities by designing and simulating setting-specific strategies that deploy rapid diagnostic test, symptom screening, contact tracing and physical distancing. We performed extensive simulations to capture the uncertainty of outbreak trajectories and the impact of varying model parameters.

FindingsWe found the impact of testing, tracing and distancing varies with rural-urban settings. In rural communities, we found implementing either high quality (sensitivity > 50%) antigen rapid diagnostic tests or moderate physical distancing could contain the transmission. Additionally, antibody rapid diagnostic tests and symptom-based diagnosis could be useful for mitigating the transmission. In non-slum urban communities, we demonstrated that both physical distancing and case finding are essential for containing COVID-19 (average infection rate < 10%). In slum communities, we found physical distancing is less effective compared to rural and non-slum urban communities. Lastly, for all communities considered, we demonstrated contact quarantine is essential for effective containment and is effective at a low compliance rate (30%).

InterpretationOur findings could guide setting-specific strategy design for different communities in LMICs. Our assessments also have implications on applying rapid diagnostic tests and symptom-based diagnosis for case finding, tracing and distancing in lower-income communities.","Jiang, X.; Gong, W.; Gao, Y.; Fraser, C.; Holmes, C.",2021-03-20,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.03.17.21253853,1,Chris Holmes,University of Oxford,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.17.21253853v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.17.21253853v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,"NA"

23980,Characteristics and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 among children in Italy: a cross-sectional study in 20 pediatric centers,"BackgroundNo study has described factors associated with COVID-19 diagnosis in children.

AimDescribe characteristics and risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis in children tested in 20 pediatric centers across Italy.

MethodsCases aged 0-18 years tested for SARS-CoV-2 between February 23 and May 24 2020 were included. Our primary analysis focused on children tested because of COVID-19 suggestive symptoms.

ResultsAmong 2494 children tested for SARS-CoV-2, 2148 (86.1%) had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 included - beside fever (82.4%) and respiratory signs or symptoms (60.4%) - also gastrointestinal (18.2%), neurological (18.9%), cutaneous (3.8%) and other flu-like presentations (17.8%). In multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 were: exposure history (adjusted OR 39.83 95%CI 17.52-90.55 p<0.0001), cardiac disease (adjusted OR 3.10 95%CI 1.19-5.02 p<0.0001), fever (adjusted OR 3.05 % 95% CI 1.67-5.58 p=0.0003), and anosmia/ageusia (OR 4.08 95%CI 1.69 -9.84 p=0.002). Among 190 (7.6%) children diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, only four (2.1%) required respiratory support and two (1.1%) were admitted in ICU, while 100% recovered.

ConclusionRecommendations for SARS-CoV-2 testing in children should be updated based on the evidence of broader clinical features. Exposure history, fever, and anosmia/ageusia are strong risk factors for COVID-19 in children, while other symptoms dont seem helping discriminating in between the SARS-CoV-2 positive and the negative cases. This study confirm that COVID-19 is a mild disease in the general population of children in Italy.

6142,Worldwide Effectiveness of Various Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention Control Strategies on the Global COVID-19 Pandemic: A Linearised Control Model,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is a virus which has lead to a global pandemic. Worldwide, more than 130 countries have imposed severe restrictions, which form part of a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI)s. We aimed to quantify the country-specific effects of these NPIs and compare them using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) stringency index, p, as a measure of NPI stringency.

MethodsWe developed a dual latent/observable Susceptible Infected Recovered Deaths (SIRD) model and applied it on each of 22 countries and 25 states in the US using publicly available data. The observable model parameters were extracted using kernel functions. The regression of the transmission rate, {beta}, as a function of p in each locale was modeled through the intervention leverage, s, an initial transmission rate, {beta}0 and a typical adjustment time, [Formula].

ResultsThe world average for the intervention leverage, s = 0.01 (95% CI 0.0102 - 0.0112) had an ensemble standard deviation of 0.0017 (95% C.I. 0.0014 - 0.0021), strongly indicating a universal behavior.

DiscussionOur study indicates that removing NPIs too swiftly will result in the resurgence of the spread within one to two months, in alignment with the current WHO recommendations. Moreover, we have quantified and are able to predict the effect of various combinations of NPIs. There is a minimum NPI level, below which leads to resurgence of the outbreak (in the absence of pharmaceutical and clinical advances). For the epidemic to remain sub-critical, the rate with which the intervention leverage s increases should outpace that of the relaxation of NPIs.","Naude, J.; Mellado, B.; Choma, J.; Correa, F.; Dahbi, S.; Dwolatzky, B.; Dwolatzky, L.; Hayasi, K.; Lieberman, B.; Maslo, C.; Monnakgotla, K.; Ruan, X.; Stevenson, F.",2020-05-12,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.30.20085316,2,Bruce Mellado,University of the Witwatersrand,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.30.20085316v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.30.20085316v2.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
18232,Association of social distancing and masking with risk of COVID-19,"Given the continued burden of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) across the U.S., there is a high unmet need for data to inform decision-making regarding social distancing and universal masking. We examined the association of community-level social distancing measures and individual masking with risk of predicted COVID-19 in a large prospective U.S. cohort study of 198,077 participants. Individuals living in communities with the greatest social distancing had a 31% lower risk of predicted COVID-19 compared with those living in communities with poor social distancing. Self-reported masking was associated with a 63% reduced risk of predicted COVID-19 even among individuals living in a community with poor social distancing. These findings provide support for the efficacy of mask-wearing even in settings of poor social distancing in reducing COVID-19 transmission. In the current environment of relaxed social distancing mandates and practices, universal masking may be particularly important in mitigating risk of infection.","Kwon, S.; Joshi, A.

We found that waves of unreliable and low-quality information anticipate the epidemic ones, exposing entire countries to irrational social behavior and serious threats for public health. When the epidemics hit the same area, reliable information is quickly inoculated, like antibodies, and the system shifts focus towards certified informational sources.

4127,How much of SARS-CoV-2 Infections is India detecting? A model-based estimation,"Background and RationaleAmid SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the low number of infections for a population size of 1.38 billion is widely discussed, but with no definite answers.

MethodsWe used the model proposed by Bommer and Vollmer to assess the quality of official case records. The infection fatality rates were taken from Verity et al (2020). Age distribution of the population for India and states are taken from the Census of India (2011). Reported number of deaths and SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases from https://www.covid19india.org. The reported numbers of samples tests were collected from the reports of the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).

ResultsThe findings suggest that India is detecting just 3.6% of the total number of infections with a huge variation across its states. Among 13 states which have more than 100 COVID-19 cases, the detection rate varies from 81.9% (of 410 estimated infections) in Kerala to 0.8% (of 35487 estimated infections) in Madhya Pradesh and 2.4% (of 7431 estimated infections) in Gujarat.

ConclusionAs the study reports a lower number of deaths and higher recovery rates in the states with a high detection rate, thus suggest that India must enhance its testing capacity and go for widespread testing. Late detection puts patients in greater need of mechanical ventilation and ICU care, which imposes greater costs on the health system. The country should also adopt population-level random testing to assess the prevalence of the infection.","Goli, S.; James, K.

18192,Corticosteroids are associated with increased survival in elderly presenting severe SARS-Cov2 infection,"ObjectiveTo assess the effectiveness of corticosteroids among elderly patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen.

DesignComparative observational study based on routine care data. Baseline characteristics of patients were balanced using propensity-score inverse probability of treatment weighting.

SettingGeriatric and infectious diseases wards from 36 hospitals in France and Luxembourg.

ParticipantsAdults > 80 years old PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or typical CT-scan images, requiring oxygen [&ge;] 3L/min and with an inflammatory syndrome (C-reactive protein [&ge;] 40mg/L).

MeasurementsThe primary outcome was overall survival at day 14. The secondary outcome was the proportion of patients discharged from hospital to home/rehabilitation on day 14. Adverse events were abstracted from electronic health records.

ResultsAmong the 267 patients included in the analysis, 96 were assigned to the treatment group. Median age was 86, interquartile range 83 to 90 and 95% had a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed diagnosis. Use of corticosteroids was significantly associated with an increased survival (weighted hazard ratio [wHR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.97). There was no significant difference between the treatment and control groups regarding the proportion of patients discharged to home/rehabilitation at day 14 (wRR 1.11, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.81).

14790,Inference of SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding neutralizing antibody titers in sera from hospitalized COVID-19 patients by using commercial enzyme and chemiluminescent immunoassays,"BackgroundWhether antibody levels measured by commercially-available enzyme or chemiluminescent immunoassays targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein can act as a proxy for serum neutralizing activity remains to be established for many of these assays.

ObjectivesTo evaluate the degree of correlation between neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) binding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and SARS-CoV-2-S-IgG levels measured by four commercial immunoassays in sera drawn from hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Patients and MethodsNinety sera from 51 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were assayed by a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay, the LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA, the MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG and the COVID-19 ELISA IgG assays.

ResultsOverall, the results obtained with the COVID-19 ELISA IgG test showed the highest agreement with the NtAb assay ({kappa}, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.63-1). The most sensitive tests were the pseudotyped virus NtAb assay and the COVID-19 ELISA IgG assay (92.2% for both). Overall, the degree correlation between antibody titers resulting in 50% virus neutralization (NtAb50) in the pseudotyped virus assay and SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels was strong for the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (Rho = 0.73) and moderate for the remaining assays (Rho = 0.48 to 0.59). The kinetic profile of serum NtAb50 titers could not be reliably predicted by any of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassays.

ConclusionsThe suitability of SARS-CoV-2-S-IgG commercial immunoassays for inferring neutralizing activity of sera from hospitalized COVID-19 patients varies widely across tests and is influenced by the time of sera collection after the onset of symptoms.","Valdivia, A.; Torres, I.; Latorre, V.; Frances-Gomez, C.; Albert, E.; Gozalbo, R.; Alcaraz, M.

25207,"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA in the human milk of COVID-19 vaccinated, lactating health care workers","ImportanceIn 2019, a deadly virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for COVID-19, emerged. In December 2020, two mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines were approved for use in the United States (US) which provide immunity to those receiving the vaccine. Maternally derived antibodies are a key element of infants immunity. Certain vaccines given to pregnant and lactating mothers provide immunity to infants through transmission across the placenta, umbilical cord (IgG) and human milk (IgA). Human milk produced by mothers with a history of COVID-19 infection contains SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG.

ObjectiveTo determine whether SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulins are found in human milk after the COVID-19 vaccination, and to characterize the types of immunoglobulins present.

Design, setting, and participantsThis is a prospective observational study conducted at Shands Hospital, University of Florida from December 2020 to March 2021. Twenty-two lactating healthcare workers who received the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer/BioNtech or Moderna) made up the sample group. Plasma and human milk were collected at three-time points (pre-vaccination, post-first vaccine dose, and post-second vaccine dose). SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA and IgG in human milk and in plasma were measured by ELISA. Maternal demographics was compiled.

ExposuresPfizer/BioNtech or Moderna vaccination.

Main outcome and measureLevels of SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG in human milk and plasma.

ResultsWe found significant secretion of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA and IgG in human milk and plasma after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

Conclusions and relevanceOur results show that the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines induce SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA and IgG secretion in human milk. Further studies are needed to determine the duration of this immune response, its capacity to neutralize the COVID-19 virus, the transfer of passive immunity to breastfeeding infants, and the potential therapeutic use of human milk IgA to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19.

FindingsIn this prospective observational study that included 22 lactating women, we found SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA in the human milk in response to the COVID-19 vaccination series. There is statistically significant secretion of SARS-CoV-2 IgA in human milk after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination series completion (p < 0.0001).

22255,"COVIDHunter: An Accurate, Flexible, and Environment-Aware Open-Source COVID-19 Outbreak Simulation Model","MotivationEarly detection and isolation of COVID-19 patients are essential for successful implementation of mitigation strategies and eventually curbing the disease spread. With a limited number of daily COVID-19 tests performed in every country, simulating the COVID-19 spread along with the potential effect of each mitigation strategy currently remains one of the most effective ways in managing the healthcare system and guiding policy-makers. We introduce COVIDHunter, a flexible and accurate COVID-19 outbreak simulation model that evaluates the current mitigation measures that are applied to a region and provides suggestions on what strength the upcoming mitigation measure should be. The key idea of COVIDHunter is to quantify the spread of COVID-19 in a geographical region by simulating the average number of new infections caused by an infected person considering the effect of external factors, such as environmental conditions (e.g., climate, temperature, humidity) and mitigation measures.

ResultsUsing Switzerland as a case study, COVIDHunter estimates that the policy-makers need to keep the current mitigation measures for at least 30 days to prevent demand from quickly exceeding existing hospital capacity. Relaxing the mitigation measures by 50% for 30 days increases both the daily capacity need for hospital beds and daily number of deaths exponentially by an average of 23.8 x, who may occupy ICU beds and ventilators for a period of time. Unlike existing models, the COVIDHunter model accurately monitors and predicts the daily number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19. Our model is flexible to configure and simple to modify for modeling different scenarios under different environmental conditions and mitigation measures.

9765,Low and high infection dose transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the first COVID-19 clusters in Northern Germany,"ObjectivesWe used viral genomics to deeply analyze the first SARS-CoV-2 infection clusters in the metropolitan region of Hamburg, Germany. Epidemiological analysis and contact tracing together with a thorough investigation of virus variant patterns revealed low and high infection dose transmissions to be involved in transmission events.

MethodsInfection control measures were applied to follow up contract tracing. Metagenomic RNA- and SARS-CoV-2 amplicon sequencing was performed from 25 clinical samples for sequence analysis and variant calling.

ResultsThe index patient acquired SARS-CoV-2 in Italy and after his return to Hamburg transmitted it to 2 out of 132 contacts. Virus genomics and variant pattern clearly confirms the initial local cluster. We identify frequent single nucleotide polymorphisms at positions 241, 3037, 14408, 23403 and 28881 previously described in Italian sequences and now considered as one major genotype in Europe. While the index patient showed a single nucleotide polymorphism only one variant was transmitted to the recipients. Different to the initial cluster, we observed in household clusters occurring at the time in Hamburg also intra-host viral species transmission events.

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 variant tracing highlights both, low infection dose transmissions suggestive of fomites as route of infection in the initial cluster and high and low infection dose transmissions in family clusters indicative of fomites and droplets as infection routes. This suggests (1) single viral particle infection can be sufficient to initiate SARS-CoV-2 infection and (2) household/family members are exposed to high virus loads and therefore have a high risk to acquire SARS-CoV-2.","Pfefferle, S.; Guenther, T.; Kobbe, R.; Czech-Sioli, M.; Noerz, D.; Santer, R.; Oh, J.; Kluge, S.; Oestereich, L.; Peldschus, K.; Indenbirken, D.; Huang, J.; Grundhoff, A.; Aepfelbacher, M.; Knobloch, J.; Luetgehetmann, M.; Fischer, N.",2020-06-16,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.11.20127332,1,Nicole Fischer,University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.11.20127332v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.11.20127332v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
10313,"Association Between Nursing Home Crowding and COVID-19 Infection and Mortality in Ontario, Canada","ImportanceNursing home residents have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 epidemic. Prevention recommendations have emphasized frequent testing of healthcare personnel and residents, but additional strategies are needed to protect nursing home residents.

ObjectiveWe developed a reproducible index of nursing home crowding and determined whether crowding was associated with incidence of COVID-19 in the first months of the COVID-19 epidemic.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsPopulation-based retrospective cohort study of over 78,000 residents of 618 distinct nursing homes in Ontario, Canada from March 29 to May 20, 2020.

ExposureThe nursing home crowding index equalled the average number of residents per bedroom and bathroom.

OutcomesPrimary outcomes included the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 infection and mortality, per 100 residents; introduction of COVID-19 into a home ([&ge;]1 resident case) was a negative tracer.

ResultsOf 623 homes in Ontario, we obtained complete information on 618 homes (99%) housing 78,607 residents. A total of 5,218 residents (6.6%) developed COVID-19 infection, and 1,452 (1.8%) died with COVID-19 infection as of May 20, 2020. COVID-19 infection was distributed unevenly across nursing homes: 4,496 (86%) of infections occurred in just 63 (10%) of homes. The crowding index ranged across homes from 1.3 (mainly single-occupancy rooms) to 4.0 (exclusively quadruple occupancy rooms); 308 (50%) homes had high crowding index ([&ge;]2). Incidence in high crowding index homes was 9.7%, versus 4.5% in low crowding index homes (p<0.001), while COVID-19 mortality was 2.7%, versus 1.3%. The likelihood of COVID-19 introduction did not differ (31.3% vs 30.2%, p=0.79). After adjustment for regional, nursing home, and resident covariates, the crowding index remained associated with increased risk of infection (RR=1.72, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.11-2.65) and mortality (RR=1.72, 95%CI: 1.03-2.86). Propensity score analysis yielded similar conclusions for infection (RR=2.06, 95%CI: 1.34-3.17) and mortality (RR=2.09, 95%CI: 1.30-3.38). Simulations suggested that converting all 4-bed rooms to 2-bed rooms would have averted 988 (18.9%) infections of COVID-19 and 271 (18.7%) deaths.

Conclusions and RelevanceCrowding was associated with higher incidence of COVID-19 infection and mortality. Reducing crowding in nursing homes could prevent future COVID-19 mortality.","Brown, K.

24817,A Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Variant Detection by Molecular-Clamping Based RT-qPCR,"We applied XNA-based Molecular Clamping Technology to develop a multiplex qPCR assay for rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 mutations. A total of 278 previously tested SARS-COV-2 positive samples originating primarily from San Francisco Bay Area were tested, including 139 Samples collected in middle January and 139 samples collected at the end of February 2021, respectively. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike-gene D614G mutation was detected from 58 samples (41.7%) collected in January 2021 and, 78 samples (56.1%) collected in February. Notably, while there were no N501Y mutation detected in samples from January, seven of the February samples were tested positive for the N501Y and D614G mutations. The results suggest a relatively recent and speedy spreading of the UK variant (B.1.1.7) in Northern California. This new Molecular Clamping technology-based multiplex RT-qPCR assay is highly sensitive and specific and can help speed up large scale testing for SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Shen, S.; Fu, A.

21428,High density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk of subsequent COVID-19 hospitalisation: the UK Biobank study,"ObjectiveThere is growing evidence of, and biological plausibility for, elevated levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), being related to lower rates of severe infection. Accordingly, we tested whether pre-pandemic HDL-C within the normal range is associated with subsequent COVID-19 hospitalisations and death.

ApproachWe analysed data on 317,306 participants from UK Biobank, a prospective cohort study, baseline data for which were collected between 2006 and 2010. Follow-up for COVID-19 was via hospitalisation records and a national mortality registry.

ResultsAfter controlling for a series of confounding factors which included health behaviours, inflammatory markers, and socio-economic status, higher levels of HDL-C were related to a lower risk of later hospitalisation for COVID-19. The effect was linear (p-value for trend 0.001) such that a 0.2 mmol/L increase in HDL-C was associated with a corresponding 9% reduction in risk (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 0.91; 0.86, 0.96). A very similar pattern of association was apparent when COVID-19 mortality was the outcome of interest (odds ratio per 0.2 mmol/l increase in HDL-C: 0.90; 0.81, 1.00); again, a stepwise effect was evident (p-value for trend 0.03).

ConclusionsThese novel results for HDL-C and COVID-19 events warrant testing in other studies.","Lassale, C.; Hamer, M.; Hernaez, A.; Gale, C. R.; Batty, G.

17862,"NUTRITIONAL IMMUNITY, ZINC SUFFICIENCY AND COVID-19 MORTALITY IN SOCIALLY SIMILAR EUROPEAN POPULATIONS","The impact of Zinc (Zn) sufficiency/supplementation on COVID-19 mortality and infections remains unknown. During an infection, the levels of free Zinc are reduced as a part of  nutritional immunity to limit the growth and replication of pathogens and ensuing inflammatory damage. However, considering its key role in immune competence and the widespread deficiency in large sections of different populations (3-54%), prophylactic and therapeutic Zn supplementation has become part of routine prescription even without any evidence for its protective role in COVID-19. Expectedly, multiple trials are ascertaining the positive effect of Zn supplementation on COVID-19 when given in combination with standard of care treatments. However, the trials designs seem to lack the power to identify negative effects especially in the currently identified vulnerable groups, e.g., elderly, comorbid (contributing 9 out of 10 deaths; up to >8000-fold higher mortality). When we analyze the COVID-19 data from 23 socially similar European populations with supposedly comparable confounders (population: 522.47 million; experiencing up to >150 fold difference in death rates) and at the matching stage of the pandemic (12 March - 26 June 2020; 1st wave of infections), the populations Zn-sufficiency status is found consistently positively correlated with COVID-19 mortality (r(23): 0.7893-0.6849, p-value<0.0003) and infections [r(23):0.8084 to 0.5658; p-value<0.005]. The observed association is contrary to what would be expected if Zn sufficiency was being protective in COVID-19. Thus, controlled trials or retrospective analysis of the adverse event patients data seem warranted to correctly guide the practice of Zn supplementation in COVID-19.","Singh, S.; Diwaker, A.; Singh, R.

2442,Diagnosis of Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection by Detection of Nucleocapsid Protein,"BACKGROUNDNucleic acid test and antibody assay have been employed in the diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the use of viral antigen for diagnosis has not been successfully developed. Theoretically, viral antigen is the specific marker of the virus and precedes antibody appearance within the infected population. There is a clear need of detection of viral antigen for rapid and early diagnosis.

METHODSWe included a cohort of 239 participants with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from 7 centers for the study. We measured nucleocapsid protein in nasopharyngeal swab samples in parallel with the nucleic acid test. Nucleic acid test was taken as the reference standard, and statistical evaluation was taken in blind. We detected nucleocapsid protein in 20 urine samples in another center, employing nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test as reference standard.

RESULTSWe developed a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay for detecting nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab sample and urine within 10 minutes. 100% of nucleocapsid protein positive and negative participants accord with nucleic acid test for same samples. Further, earliest participant after 3 days of fever can be identified by the method. In an additional preliminary study, we detected nucleocapsid protein in urine in 73.6% of diagnosed COVID-19 patients.

CONCLUSIONSThose findings indicate that nucleocapsid protein assay is an accurate, rapid, early and simple method for diagnosis of COVID-19. Appearance of nucleocapsid protein in urine coincides our finding of the SARS-CoV-2 invading kidney and might be of diagnostic value.","Diao, B.; Wen, K.; Chen, J.; Liu, Y.; Yuan, Z.; Han, C.; Chen, J.; Pan, Y.; Chen, L.; Dan, Y.; Wang, J.; Chen, Y.; Deng, G.; Zhou, H.; Wu, Y.",2020-03-13,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.07.20032524,2,Yuzhang Wu,"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University,Chongqing,People\'s Republic of China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.07.20032524v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.07.20032524v2.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
2927,Screening and managing of suspected or confirmed novel coronavirus (COVID-19) patients: experiences from a tertiary hospital outside Hubei province,"ObjectivesTo report our experiences screening and managing patients with suspected or confirmed novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease using a hospital-specific protocol.

DesignLongitudinal cohort study.

SettingA 1,200 bed tertiary care teaching hospital in Chengdu, Sichuan, China.

Participants802 adults presenting to hospital with concerns of having COVID-19, 1,246 inpatients and 2,531 hospital visitors.

InterventionsScreening and management of patients using a hospital-specific protocol, which included fever triage, monitoring visitors and patients, emergency response, personnel training for healthcare team members, health education for patients and family, medical materials management, disinfection and wastes disposal protocols.

ResultsBetween 23 January and 28 February 2020, 73 people were identified as having fever plus respiratory signs with/without a history of exposure and were tested for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by our hospital lab using RT PCR. Forty-five of these 73 people were subsequently excluded based on one negative RT PCR result plus positive results to quick screening tests for flu or other respiratory viruses. The remaining 28 people received a second RT PCR test 24 h later. Three people were confirmed positive for COVID-19 based on two consecutive positive RT PCR tests whilst 25 people were excluded based on two consecutive negative tests. The three COVID-19 confirmed cases received non-critical care. There were no new infections of medical staff or new infections of other hospital inpatients.

ConclusionsA hospital-specific protocol for screening and management is necessary for reliably identifying suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during an outbreak. All three cases were detected as a result of vigilant monitoring of hospital visitors. Whilst screening out-patients presenting to a fever clinic remains important, monitoring visitors must not be overlooked.

Strengths and limitations of this study{blacktriangleright} We report a hospital-specific protocol used to screen and manage people presenting to our hospital fever clinic, inpatients and visitors during an outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia in Chengdu, Sichuan province.
{blacktriangleright}Key components of the protocol included: a three-level fever triage process; monitoring visitors and inpatients, formation of an emergency response team for COVID-19, personnel training for healthcare team members, health education for patients and family, medical materials management, and disinfection and wastes disposal protocols.
{blacktriangleright}The ability to test nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 using RT PCR in the hospital greatly shortened the time from the detection of patients to diagnosis, and was beneficial to the control of the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2.
{blacktriangleright}Although our process detected few patients, comparison with other processes, when they are published, will allow the identification of the optimal approach for screening and management.
{blacktriangleright}We suggest that if all resources had been focused on screening people through our fever clinic, we would have missed important in-hospital risks of transmitting COVID-19: The detection of a hospital visitor with COVID-19 led to the detection of an inpatient with COVID-19.","Pu, H.; Xu, Y.; Doig, G.

5053,Measure what matters: counts of hospitalized patients are a better metric for health system capacity planning for a reopening,"Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic requires accurate forecasting of health system capacity requirements using readily available inputs. We examined whether testing and hospitalization data could help quantify the anticipated burden on the health system given shelter-in-place (SIP) order.

We find a marked slowdown in the hospitalization rate within ten days of SIP even as cases continued to rise. We also find a shift towards younger patients in the age distribution of those testing positive for COVID-19 over the four weeks of SIP. The impact of this shift is a divergence between increasing positive case confirmations and slowing new hospitalizations, both of which affects the demand on health systems.

Without using local hospitalization rates and the age distribution of positive patients, current models are likely to overestimate the resource burden of COVID-19. It is imperative that health systems start using these data to quantify effects of SIP and aid reopening planning.","Kashyap, S.; Gombar, S.; Yadlowsky, S.; Callahan, A.; Fries, J.; Pinsky, B.

21198,Learning from pandemics: using extraordinary events can improve disease now-casting models,"Online searches have been used to study different health-related behaviours, including monitoring disease outbreaks. An obvious caveat is that several reasons can motivate individuals to seek online information and models that are blind to peoples motivations are of limited use and can even mislead. This is particularly true during extraordinary public health crisis, such as the ongoing pandemic, when fear, curiosity and many other reasons can lead individuals to search for health-related information, masking the disease-driven searches. However, health crisis can also offer an opportunity to disentangle between different drivers and learn about human behavior. Here, we focus on the two pandemics of the 21st century (2009-H1N1 flu and Covid-19) and propose a methodology to discriminate between search patterns linked to general information seeking (media driven) and search patterns possibly more associated with actual infection (disease driven). We show that by learning from such pandemic periods, with high anxiety and media hype, it is possible to select online searches and improve model performance both in pandemic and seasonal settings. Moreover, and despite the common claim that more data is always better, our results indicate that lower volume of the right data can be better than including large volumes of apparently similar data, especially in the long run. Our work provides a general framework that can be applied beyond specific events and diseases, and argues that algorithms can be improved simply by using less (better) data. This has important consequences, for example, to solve the accuracy-explainability trade-off in machine-learning.","Mesquita, S.; Vieira, C.

Therefore, the importance of supplying vaccines against the seasonal influenza has been pointed out all over the world. As an example in Japan, the number of people infected with the seasonal influenza, hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, and pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF), which are the seasonal infectious diseases in the 2020 season, has decreased remarkably compared to the number of people infected each year. It is believed that the significant reduction in the number of people infected with these seasonal infectious diseases is a result of the pervasive hand washing, wearing masks and maintaining social distance in COVID-19 rea. To examine the correlation between the three factors of the number of people with each seasonal infectious disease, the mask wearing rate, and the outing rate, we created a three-dimensional scatter plot based on these three factors using principal component analysis.

Agent-based modeling to identify when vaccine coverage makes nonpharmaceutical interventions for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections redundant in indoor gatherings,"As vaccination efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic are ramping up worldwide, there are rising concerns that individuals will begin to eschew nonpharmaceutical interventions for preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and attempt to return to pre-pandemic normalcy before vaccine coverage levels effectively mitigate transmission risk. In the U.S.A., some governing bodies have already weakened or repealed guidelines for nonpharmaceutical intervention use, despite a recent spike in national COVID-19 cases and majority population of unvaccinated individuals. Recent modeling suggests that repealing nonpharmaceutical intervention guidelines too early into vaccine rollouts will lead to localized increases in COVID-19 cases, but the magnitude of nonpharmaceutical intervention effects on individual-level SARS-CoV-2 infection risk in fully- and partially-vaccinated populations is unclear. We use a previously-published agent-based model to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in indoor gatherings of varying durations, population densities, and vaccination coverage levels. By simulating nonpharmaceutical interventions in some gatherings but not others, we were able to quantify the difference in SARS-CoV-2 infection risk when nonpharmaceutical interventions were used, relative to scenarios with no nonpharmaceutical interventions. We found that nonpharmaceutical interventions will often reduce secondary attack rates, especially during brief interactions, and therefore there is no definitive vaccination coverage level that makes nonpharmaceutical interventions completely redundant. However, the reduction effect on absolute SARS-CoV-2 infection risk conferred by nonpharmaceutical interventions is likely proportional to COVID-19 prevalence. Therefore, if COVID-19 prevalence decreases in the future, nonpharmaceutical interventions will likely still confer protective effects but potential benefits may be small enough to remain within """"effectively negligible"""" risk thresholds.","Farthing, T.

3720,Exponential phase of covid19 expansion is driven by airport connections,"The pandemic state of COVID-19 caused by the SARS CoV-2 put the world in quarantine, led to hundreds of thousands of deaths and is causing an unprecedented economic crisis. However, COVID-19 is spreading in different rates at different countries. Here, we tested the effect of three classes of predictors, i.e., socioeconomic, climatic and transport, on the rate of daily increase of COVID-19. We found that global connections, represented by countries importance in the global air transportation network, is the main explanation for the growth rate of COVID-19 in different countries. Climate, geographic distance and socioeconomics had a milder effect in this big picture analysis. Geographic distance and climate were significant barriers in the past but were surpassed by the human engine that allowed us to colonize most of our planet land surface. Our results indicate that the current claims that the growth rate of COVID-19 may be lower in warmer and humid tropical countries should be taken very carefully, at risk to disturb well-established and effective policy of social isolation that may help to avoid higher mortality rates due to the collapse of national health systems.","Coelho, M.

21254,"Safety and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein vaccine formulations in healthy adults: a randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study","BackgroundEffective vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are urgently needed. CoV2 preS dTM is a stabilised pre-fusion S protein vaccine produced in a baculovirus expression system. We present interim safety and immunogenicity results of the first-in-human study of the CoV2 preS dTM vaccine with two different adjuvant formulations.

MethodsThis Phase I/II, randomised, double-blind study (NCT04537208) is being conducted in healthy, SARS-CoV-2-seronegative adults in the USA. Participants were stratified by age (18-49 and [&ge;]50 years) and randomised to receive one (on Day[D]1) or two doses (D1, D22) of placebo or candidate vaccine, containing: low-dose (LD, effective dose 1.3 {micro}g) or high-dose (HD, 2.6 {micro}g) antigen with adjuvant AF03 (Sanofi Pasteur) or AS03 (GlaxoSmithKline); or unadjuvanted HD (18-49 years only). Safety was assessed up to D43. SARS-CoV-2 neutralising and binding antibody profiles were assessed in D1, D22 and D36 serum samples.

FindingsThe interim safety analyses included 439/441 randomised participants. There were no related unsolicited immediate AEs, serious AEs, medically attended AEs classified as severe, or AE of special interest. More grade 3 solicited reactions were reported than expected after the second dose in the adjuvanted vaccine groups. Neutralising and binding antibody responses after two vaccine doses were higher in adjuvanted versus unadjuvanted groups, in AS03-versus AF03-adjuvanted groups, in HD versus LD groups, and in younger versus older age strata.

InterpretationThe lower than expected immune responses, especially in the older age stratum, and the higher than anticipated reactogenicity post dose 2 were likely due to a higher than anticipated host cell protein content and lower than planned antigen dose in the clinical material. Further development of the AS03-adjuvanted candidate vaccine will focus on identifying the optimal antigen formulation and dose.","Goepfert, P. A.; Fu, B.; Chabanon, A.-L.; Bonaparte, M.

20924,Aerosol tracer testing in the cabin of wide-bodied Boeing 767 and 777 aircraft to simulate exposure potential of infectious particulate such as SARS-CoV-2,"The COVID-19 pandemic has reintroduced questions regarding the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure amongst passengers on an aircraft. Quantifying risk with computational fluid dynamics models or contact tracing methods alone is challenging, as experimental results for inflight biological aerosols is lacking. Using fluorescent aerosol tracers and real time optical sensors, coupled with DNA-tagged tracers for aerosol deposition, we executed ground and inflight testing on Boeing 767 and 777 airframes.

Analysis here represents tracer particles released from a simulated infected passenger, in multiple rows and seats, to determine the exposure risk via penetration into breathing zones in that row and numerous rows ahead and behind the index case. We completed over 65 releases of 180,000,000 fluorescent particles from the source, with 40+ Instantaneous Biological Analyzer and Collector sensors placed in passenger breathing zones for real-time measurement of simulated virus particle penetration.

Results from both airframes showed a minimum reduction of 99.54% of 1 {micro}m aerosols from the index source to the breathing zone of a typical passenger seated directly next to the source. An average 99.97 to 99.98% reduction was measured for the breathing zones tested in the 767 and 777, respectively. Contamination of surfaces from aerosol sources was minimal, and DNA-tagged 3 {micro}m tracer aerosol collection techniques agreed with fluorescent methodologies.","Kinahan, S. M.; Silcott, D.

5159,Predicting mortality due to SARS-CoV-2: A mechanistic score relating obesity and diabetes to COVID-19 outcomes in Mexico,"BACKGROUNDThe SARS-CoV-2 outbreak poses challenge to healthcare systems due to high complication rates in patients with cardiometabolic diseases. Here, we identify risk factors and propose a clinical score to predict COVID-19 lethality, including specific factors for diabetes and obesity and its role in improving risk prediction.

METHODSWe obtained data of confirmed and negative COVID-19 cases and their demographic and health characteristics from the General Directorate of Epidemiology of Mexican Ministry of Health. We investigated specific risk factors associated to COVID-19 positivity and mortality and explored the impact of diabetes and obesity on modifying COVID-19 related lethality. Finally, we built a clinical score to predict COVID-19 lethality.

RESULTSAmong 177,133 subjects at May 18th, 2020, we observed 51,633 subjects with SARS-CoV-2 and 5,332 deaths. Risk factors for lethality in COVID-19 include early-onset diabetes, obesity, COPD, advanced age, hypertension, immunosuppression, and CKD; we observed that obesity mediates 49.5% of the effect of diabetes on COVID-19 lethality. Early-onset diabetes conferred an increased risk of hospitalization and obesity conferred an increased risk for ICU admission and intubation. Our predictive score for COVID-19 lethality included age [&ge;]65 years, diabetes, early-onset diabetes, obesity, age <40 years, CKD, hypertension, and immunosuppression and significantly discriminates lethal from non-lethal COVID-19 cases (c-statistic=0.823).

RESULTSHere, we propose a mechanistic approach to evaluate risk for complications and lethality attributable to COVID-19 considering the effect of obesity and diabetes in Mexico. Our score offers a clinical tool for quick determination of high-risk susceptibility patients in a first contact scenario.","Bello-Chavolla, O. Y.; Bahena-Lopez, J. P.; Antonio-Villa, N.

4103,Identification and Estimation of Undetected COVID-19 Cases Using Testing Data from Iceland,"In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, international testing efforts tended to target individuals whose symptoms and/or jobs placed them at a high presumed risk of infection. Testing regimes of this sort potentially result in a high proportion of cases going undetected. Quantifying this parameter, which we refer to as the undetected rate, is an important contribution to the analysis of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We show that partial identification techniques can credibly deal with the data problems that common COVID-19 testing programs induce (i.e. excluding quarantined individuals from testing and low participation in random screening programs). We use public data from two Icelandic testing regimes during the first month of the outbreak and estimate an identified interval for the undetected rate. Our main approach estimates that the undetected rate was between 89% and 93% before the medical system broadened its eligibility criteria and between 80% and 90% after.","Stock, J. H.; Aspelund, K.

15862,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies among Danish and Swedish Falck emergency and non-emergency healthcare workers,"Background: Knowledge about the COVID-19 outbreak is still sparse especially in a cross-national setting. COVID-19 is caused by a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of the study is to contribute to the surveillance of the pandemic by bringing new knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers and evaluating whether certain job functions is associated with a higher risk of being infected, and to clarify if such association is mediated by the number of individuals that the employees meet during a workday. Finally, we will investigate regional and national differences in seroprevalence. Methods: A bi-national prospective observational cohort study including 3,272 adults employed at Falck in Sweden and Denmark. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies every second week for a period of 8 weeks from June 22, 2020 until August 10, 2020. Descriptive statistics as well as multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied. Results: Of the 3,272 Falck employees participating in this study, 159 (4.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroprevalence was lower among Danish Falck employees than among those from Sweden (2.8% in Denmark and 8.3% in Sweden). We also found that number of customer or patient contacts during a workday was the most prominent predictor for seropositivity, and that ambulance staff was the most vulnerable staff group. Conclusions: Our study presents geographical variations in seroprevalence within the Falck organization and shows evidence that social interaction is one of the biggest risk factors for getting infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Laursen, J.; Petersen, J.; Didriksen, M.; Iversen, K.

8198,Syndromic Surveillance for COVID-19 in Canada,"BackgroundSyndromic surveillance through web or phone-based polling has been used to track the course of infectious diseases worldwide. Our study objective was to describe the characteristics, symptoms, and self-reported testing rates of respondents in three different COVID-19 symptom surveys in Canada.

MethodsData sources consisted of two distinct Canada-wide web-based surveys, and phone polling in Ontario. All three sources contained self-reported information on COVID-19 symptoms and testing. In addition to describing respondent characteristics, we examined symptom frequency and the testing rate among the symptomatic, as well as rates of symptoms and testing across respondent groups.

ResultsWe found that 1.6% of respondents experienced a symptom on the day of their survey, 15% of Ontario households had a symptom in the previous week, and 44% of Canada-wide respondents had a symptom in the previous month over March-April 2020. Across the three surveys, SARS-CoV-2-testing was reported in 2-9% of symptomatic responses. Women, younger and middle-aged adults (versus older adults) and Indigenous/First nations/Inuit/Metis were more likely to report at least one symptom, and visible minorities were more likely to report the combination of fever with cough or shortness of breath.

InterpretationThe low rate of testing among those reporting symptoms suggests significant opportunity to expand testing among community-dwelling residents of Canada. Syndromic surveillance data can supplement public health reports and provide much-needed context to gauge the adequacy of current SARS-CoV-2 testing rates.","Lapointe-Shaw, L.; Rader, B.; Astley, C.

18624,Association of HLA class I genotypes with age at death of COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundHLA class I molecules play a crucial role in the development of a specific immune response to viral infections by presenting viral peptides to cell surface where they will be further recognized by T cells. In the present manuscript we explored whether HLA class I genotype can be associated with critical course of COVID-19 by searching possible connections between genotypes of deceased patients and their age at death.

Methods and FindingsHLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C genotypes of n = 111 deceased patients with COVID-19 (Moscow, Russia) and n = 428 volunteers were identified with targeted next-generation sequencing. Deceased patients were splitted into two groups according to age at death: n = 26 adult patients with age at death below 60 completed years (inclusively) and n = 85 elderly patients over 60. With the use of HLA class I genotypes we developed a risk score which is associated with the ability to present SARS-CoV-2 peptides by an individuals HLA class I molecule set. The resulting risk score was significantly higher in the group of deceased adults compared to elderly adults (p = 0.00348, AUC ROC = 0.68). In particular, presence of HLA-A*01:01 allele was associated with high risk, while HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*03:01 mainly contributed to the low risk group. The analysis of homozygous patients highlighted the results even stronger: homozygosity by HLA-A*01:01 mainly accompanied early deaths, while only one HLA-A*02:01 homozygote died before 60.

ConclusionsThe obtained results suggest the important role of HLA class I peptide presentation in the development of a specific immune response to COVID-19. While prediction of age at death by HLA class I genotype had a reliable performance, involvement of HLA class II genotype can make it even higher in the future studies.","Shkurnikov, M.; Nersisyan, S.; Jankevic, T.; Galatenko, A.; Gordeev, I.; Vechorko, V.; Tonevitsky, A.",2020-11-22,Genetic And Genomic Medicine,10.1101/2020.11.19.20234567,2,Stepan Nersisyan,HSE University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.19.20234567v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.19.20234567v2.full.pdf,cc_by,10.3389/fimmu.2021.641900
4346,Household Secondary Attack Rate of COVID-19 and Associated Determinants,"BackgroundAs of April 2, 2020, the global reported number of COVID-19 cases has crossed over 1 million with more than 55,000 deaths. The household transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen, remains elusive.

MethodsBased on a comprehensive contact-tracing dataset from Guangzhou, we estimated both the population-level effective reproductive number and individual-level secondary attack rate (SAR) in the household setting. We assessed age effects on transmissibility and the infectivity of COVID-19 cases during their incubation period.

ResultsA total of 195 unrelated clusters with 212 primary cases, 137 nonprimary (secondary or tertiary) cases and 1938 uninfected close contacts were traced. We estimated the household SAR to be 13.8% (95% CI: 11.1-17.0%) if household contacts are defined as all close relatives and 19.3% (95% CI: 15.5-23.9%) if household contacts only include those at the same residential address as the cases, assuming a mean incubation period of 4 days and a maximum infectious period of 13 days. The odds of infection among children (<20 years old) was only 0.26 (95% CI: 0.13-0.54) times of that among the elderly ([&ge;]60 years old). There was no gender difference in the risk of infection. COVID-19 cases were at least as infectious during their incubation period as during their illness. On average, a COVID-19 case infected 0.48 (95% CI: 0.39-0.58) close contacts. Had isolation not been implemented, this number increases to 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51-0.75). The effective reproductive number in Guangzhou dropped from above 1 to below 0.5 in about 1 week.

ConclusionSARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible in households than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the elderly [&ge;]60 years old are the most vulnerable to household transmission. Case finding and isolation alone may be inadequate to contain the pandemic and need to be used in conjunction with heightened restriction of human movement as implemented in Guangzhou.","Jing, Q.-L.; Liu, M.-J.; Yuan, J.; Zhang, Z.-B.; Zhang, A.-R.; Dean, N.

4614,CoroNet: A Deep Network Architecture for Semi-Supervised Task-Based Identification of COVID-19 from Chest X-ray Images,"In late 2019, a new Coronavirus disease, referred to as Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged in Wuhan city, Hubei, China, and resulted in a global pandemic--claiming a large number of lives and affecting billions all around the world. The current global standard used in diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected cases is the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Although the RT-PCR remains the standard reference for diagnosis purposes, it is a time-consuming and expensive test, and moreover, it usually suffers from high rates of false-negatives. Several early works have reported that the sensitivity of the chest Computed Tomography (CT) and the chest X-ray imaging are noticeably greater than that of the RT-PCR test at the initial representations of the disease, making them great candidates for developing new and sophisticated methodologies for analysis and classification of COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we establish the use of a rapid, non-invasive and cost-effective X-ray-based method as a key diagnosis and screening tool for COVID-19 at early and intermediate stages of the disease. To this end, we develop a novel and sophisticated deep learning-based signal and image processing technique as well as classification methodology for analyzing X-ray images specific to COVID-19 disease. Specifically, we consider a semi-supervised learning methodology based on AutoEncoders to first extract the infected legions in chest X-ray manifestation of COVID-19 and other Pneumonia-like diseases (as well as healthy cases). Then, we utilize this highly-tailored deep architecture to extract the relevant features specific to each class (i.e., healthy, non-COVID pneumonia, and COVID-19) and train a powerful yet efficient classifier to perform the task of automatic diagnosis. Furthermore, the semi-supervised nature of the proposed framework enables us to efficiently exploit the limited available dataset on COVID-19 while exploiting the vast amount of available X-ray dataset for healthy and non-COVID classes. Moreover, such a semi-supervised approach does not require an expert-annotated lesion area for each class. Our numerical investigations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for COVID-19 identification while employing approximately ten times fewer training parameters as compared to other existing methodologies for classification of the COVID-19 from X-ray images (facilitating efficient training in a limited data regime). We further develop explainable artificial intelligence tools that can explain the diagnosis by using attribution maps while providing an indispensable tool for the radiologist in triage state. We have made the codes of our proposed framework publicly available to the research and healthcare community1.","Khobahi, S.; Agarwal, C.; Soltanalian, M.",2020-04-17,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.14.20065722,1,Shahin Khobahi,University of Illinois at Chicago,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20065722v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20065722v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,"NA"
7288,"Distinct systems serology features in children, elderly and COVID patients","SARS-CoV-2, the pandemic coronavirus that causes COVID-19, has infected millions worldwide, causing unparalleled social and economic disruptions. COVID-19 results in higher pathogenicity and mortality in the elderly compared to children. Examining baseline SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive coronavirus immunological responses, induced by circulating human coronaviruses, is critical to understand such divergent clinical outcomes. The cross-reactivity of coronavirus antibody responses of healthy children (n=89), adults (n=98), elderly (n=57), and COVID-19 patients (n=19) were analysed by systems serology. While moderate levels of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM, and IgA were detected in healthy individuals, we identified serological signatures associated with SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific Fc{gamma} receptor binding, which accurately distinguished COVID-19 patients from healthy individuals and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 induces qualitative changes to antibody Fc upon infection, enhancing Fc{gamma} receptor engagement. Vastly different serological signatures were observed between healthy children and elderly, with markedly higher cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG observed in elderly, whereas children displayed elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgM, including receptor binding domain-specific IgM with higher avidity. These results suggest that less-experienced humoral immunity associated with higher IgM, as observed in children, may have the potential to induce more potent antibodies upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. These key insights will inform COVID-19 vaccination strategies, improved serological diagnostics and therapeutics.","Selva, K. J.; Van De Sandt, C. E.; Lemke, M. M.; Lee, C. Y.; Shoffner, S.

27324,Evaluation of the INDICAID COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test in symptomatic populations and asymptomatic community testing,"BackgroundAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause substantial morbidity and mortality, there is an increased need for rapid, accessible assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

MethodsHere we present a clinical evaluation and real-world implementation of the INDICAID COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test (INDICAID Rapid Test). A multi-site clinical evaluation of the INDICAID Rapid Test using prospectively collected samples from symptomatic subjects was performed. The INDICAID Rapid Test was then implemented at COVID-19 outbreak screening centers in Hong Kong to screen individuals for COVID-19 to prioritize confirmatory RT-PCR testing among asymptomatic populations.

ResultsThe clinical evaluation in symptomatic patient populations demonstrated a positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement of 85.3% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 75.6% - 91.6%) and 94.9% (95% CI: 91.6% - 96.9%), respectively, when compared to laboratory-based RT-PCR testing. When used during outbreak testing of 22,994 asymptomatic patients, the INDICAID Rapid Test demonstrated a positive percent agreement of 84.2% (95% CI: 69.6% - 92.6%) and a negative percent agreement of 99.9% (95% CI: 99.9% - 100%) compared to laboratory-based RT-PCR testing. When incorporated in a testing algorithm, the INDICAID Rapid Test reduced time to confirmatory positive result from an average 10.85 hours (standard RT-PCR only) to 0.84 hours, depending on the algorithm.

ConclusionThe INDICAID Rapid Test has excellent performance when compared to laboratory-based RT-PCR testing, and when used in tandem with RT-PCR, reduces the time to confirmatory positive result.

SummaryIn clinical evaluations, the INDICAID COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in symptomatic and asymptomatic patient populations. When used in tandem with RT-PCR testing, the INDICAID Rapid Test expedited confirmatory results and may help reduce SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.","Chiu, R.; Kojima, N.; Mosley, G.; Cheng, K.

2185,A machine learning-based model for survival prediction in patients with severe COVID-19 infection,"The sudden increase of COVID-19 cases is putting a high pressure on healthcare services worldwide. At the current stage, fast, accurate and early clinical assessment of the disease severity is vital. To support decision making and logistical planning in healthcare systems, this study leverages a database of blood samples from 404 infected patients in the region of Wuhan, China to identify crucial predictive biomarkers of disease severity. For this purpose, machine learning tools selected three biomarkers that predict the survival of individual patients with more than 90% accuracy: lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). In particular, relatively high levels of LDH alone seem to play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention. This finding is consistent with current medical knowledge that high LDH levels are associated with tissue breakdown occurring in various diseases, including pulmonary disorders such as pneumonia. Overall, this paper suggests a simple and operable formula to quickly predict patients at the highest risk, allowing them to be prioritised and potentially reducing the mortality rate.

3399,Analytical sensitivity and efficiency comparisons of SARS-COV-2 qRT-PCR primer-probe sets,"The recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exemplifies the critical need for accurate and rapid diagnostic assays to prompt clinical and public health interventions. Currently, several quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays are being used by clinical, research, and public health laboratories. However, it is currently unclear if results from different tests are comparable. Our goal was to evaluate the primer-probe sets used in four common diagnostic assays available on the World Health Organization (WHO) website. To facilitate this effort, we generated RNA transcripts to be used as assay standards and distributed them to other laboratories for internal validation. We then used (1) RNA transcript standards, (2) full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA, (3) pre-COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swabs, and (4) clinical samples from COVID-19 patients to determine analytical efficiency and sensitivity of the qRT-PCR primer-probe sets. We show that all primer-probe sets can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 at 500 virus copies per reaction, except for the RdRp-SARSr (Charite) confirmatory primer-probe set which has low sensitivity. Our findings characterize the limitations of currently used primer-probe sets and can assist other laboratories in selecting appropriate assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.","Vogels, C. B.

13042,COVID-19 Test & Trace Success Determinants: Modeling On A Network,"What determines the success of a COVID-19 Test & Trace policy? We use an SEIR agent-based model on a graph, with realistic epidemiological parameters. Simulating variations in certain parameters of Testing & Tracing, we find that important determinants of successful containment are: (i) the time from symptom onset until a patient is self-isolated and tested, and (ii) the share of contacts of a positive patient who are successfully traced. Comparatively less important is (iii) the time of test analysis and contact tracing. When the share of contacts successfully traced is higher, the Test & Trace Time rises somewhat in importance. These results are robust to a wide range of values for how infectious presymptomatic patients are, to the amount of asymptomatic patients, to the network degree distribution and to base epidemic growth rate. We also provide mathematical arguments for why these simulation results hold in more general settings. Since real world Test & Trace systems and policies could affect all three parameters, Symptom Onset to Test Time should be considered, alongside test turnaround time and contact tracing coverage, as a key determinant of Test & Trace success.","Reich, O.",2020-08-06,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.08.05.20168799,1,Ofir Reich,Google,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168799v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168799v1.full.pdf,cc_by,"NA"
11161,Predicted effects of summer holidays and seasonality on the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic in France,"1The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France has had a large death toll. It has not affected all regions similarly, since the death rate can vary several folds between regions where the epidemic has remained at a low level and regions where it got an early burst. The epidemic has been slowed down by a lockdown that lasted for almost eight weeks, and individuals can now move between metropolitan French regions without restriction. In this report we investigate the effect on the epidemic of summer holidays, during which millions of individuals will move between French regions. Additionally, we evaluate the effect of strong or weak seasonality and of several values for the reproduction number on the epidemic, in particular on the timing, the height and the spread of a second wave. To do so, we extend a SEIR model to simulate the effect of summer migrations between regions on the number and distribution of new infections. We find that the model predicts little effect of summer migrations on the epidemic, because the number of migrating infectious individuals are low as a consequence of the lockdown. However, all the reproduction numbers above 1.0 and the seasonality parameters we tried result in a second epidemic wave, with a peak date that can vary between October 2020 and April 2021. If the sanitary measures currently in place manage to keep the reproduction number below 1.0, the second wave will be avoided. If they keep the reproduction number at a low value, for instance at 1.1 as in one of our simulations, the second wave is flattened and could be similar to the first wave.","Duchemin, L.; Paris, M.; Boussau, B.",2020-07-23,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.06.20147660,3,Bastien Boussau,"Universite de Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, CNRS, Laboratoire de Biometrie et Biologie Evolutive UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147660v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147660v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
17258,Standard blood laboratory results in SARS-CoV-19 positive patients: do they show a typical pattern?,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is current pandemic disease. Acute polymerase-chain-reaction is the gold standard test for this disease, is not available everywhere. Standard blood laboratory parameters may have diagnostic potential.

MethodsWe evaluated standard blood laboratory parameters of 655 COVID-19 patients suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, who underwent PCR testing in one of five hospitals in Vienna, Austria. Additionally, clinical characteristics and 28-day outcome were obtained from medical records. We compared standard blood laboratory parameters, clinical characteristics, and outcomes between positive and negative PCR-tested patients and evaluated the ability of those parameters to distinguish between groups.

ResultsOf the 590 study patients including 276 females and 314 males, aged between 20 and 100 years, 208 were tested positive by means of PCR. Patients with positive compared to negative PCR-tests had significantly lower levels of leukocytes, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and thrombocytes; while significantly higher levels were detected with hemoglobin, C-reactive-protein (CRP), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), activated-partial-thromboplastin-time (aPTT), creatine-kinase (CK), lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine-aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate-aminotransferase (AST), and lipase. Our multivariate model correctly classified 83.9% of cases with a sensitivity of 78.4%, specificity of 87.3%, positive predictive value of 79.5%, and negative predictive value of 86.6%. Decreasing leucocytes and eosinophils and increasing hemoglobin and CRP were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of being COVID-19 positive tested.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest that especially leucocytes, eosinophils, hemoglobin, and CRP are helpful to distinguish between COVID-19 positive and negative tested patients and that a certain blood pattern is able to predict PCR-results.

SummaryDecreasing leucocytes and eosinophils and increasing hemoglobin and CRP were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of being COVID-19 positive tested. Each single parameter showed either a high sensitivity (leucocytes, eosinophils, CRP, monocytes, thrombocytes) or specificity (NLR, CK, ALT, lipase), or a sensitivity and specificity around 60% (Hb, LDH, AST).","Thell, R.; Zimmermann, J.; Szell, M.; Tomez, S.; Eisenburger, P.; Kreil, A.; Haugk, M.; Spiel, A.; Blaschke, A.; Klicpera, A.; Janata, O.; Krugluger, W.; Sebesta, C.; Herkner, H.; Laky, B.",2020-10-27,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.23.20217844,1,Rainer Thell,Donauspital Emergency Dep.

18833,Which policies most effectively reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools?,"IntroductionNew York City (NYC) has the largest public school system in the United States (US). During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, NYC was the first major US city to open schools for in-person learning in the 2020-2021 academic year. Several policies were implemented to reduce the risk of in-school transmission, including infection control measures (facemasks, physical distancing, enhanced indoor ventilation, cohorting of small groups, and hand hygiene), option of all-remote instruction, alternative options for how class schedules would rotate in-person and remote instruction, daily symptom screening, and testing 10-20% of students and staff weekly or monthly depending on local case rates. We sought to determine which of these policies had the greatest impact on reducing the risk of in-school transmission.

MethodsWe evaluated the impact of each policy by referring to global benchmarks for the secondary attack rate (SAR) of SARS-CoV-2 in school settings and by simulating the potential for transmission in NYCs rotating cohort schedules, in which teachers could act as """"bridges"""" across rotating cohorts. We estimated the impact of (1) infection control measures, (2) providing an option of all-remote instruction, (3) choice of class scheduling for in-person learners, (4) daily symptom screening, (5) testing to curtail transmission, and (6) testing to identify school outbreaks. Each policy was assessed independently of other policies, with the exception of symptom screening and random testing, which were assessed both independently and jointly.

ResultsAmong the policies analyzed, the greatest transmission reduction was associated with the infection control measures, followed by small class cohorts with an option for all-remote instruction, symptom screening, and finally randomly testing 10-20% of school attendees. Assuming adult staff are the primary source of within-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission, weekly testing of staff could be at least as effective as symptom screening, and potentially more so if testing days occur in the beginning of the workweek with results available by the following day. A combination of daily symptom screening and testing on the first workday of each week could reduce transmission by 70%.

ConclusionsAdherence to infection control is the highest priority for safe school re-opening. Further transmission reduction can be achieved through small rotating class cohorts with an option for remote learning, widespread testing at the beginning of the work week, and daily symptom screening and self-isolation. Randomly testing 10-20% of attendees weekly or monthly does not meaningfully curtail transmission and may not detect outbreaks before they have spread beyond a handful of individuals. School systems considering re-opening during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic or similarly virulent respiratory disease outbreaks should consider these relative impacts when setting policy priorities.","Bershteyn, A.; Kim, H.-Y.; Mcgillen, J.

20577,SARS-CoV-2 induces a durable and antigen specific humoral immunity after asymptomatic to mild COVID-19 infection,"Current SARS-CoV-2 serological assays generate discrepant results, and the longitudinal characteristics of antibodies targeting various antigens after asymptomatic to mild COVID-19 are yet to be established. This longitudinal cohort study including 1965 healthcare workers, of which 381 participants exhibited antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen at study inclusion, reveal that these antibodies remain detectable in most participants, 96%, at least four months post infection, despite having had no or mild symptoms. Virus neutralization capacity was confirmed by microneutralization assay in 91% of study participants at least four months post infection. Contrary to antibodies targeting the spike protein, antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein were only detected in 80% of previously anti-nucleocapsid IgG positive healthcare workers. Both anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels were significantly higher in previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients four months post infection than in healthcare workers four months post infection (p=2*10-23 and 2*10-13 respectively). Although the magnitude of humoral response was associated with disease severity, our findings support a durable and functional humoral response after SARS-CoV-2 infection even after no or mild symptoms. We further demonstrate differences in antibody kinetics depending on the antigen, arguing against the use of the nucleocapsid protein as target antigen in population-based SARS-CoV-2 serological surveys.","Havervall, S.; Jernbom Falk, A.; Klingstrom, J.; Ng, H.; Greilert Norin, N.; Gabrielsson, L.; Salomonsson, A.-C.; Isaksson, E.; Rudberg, A.-S.; Hellstrom, C.; Andersson, E.; Olofsson, J.; Skoglund, L.; Yousef, J.; Pin, E.; Christ, W.; Olausson, M.; Hedhammar, M.; Tegel, H.; Mangsbo, S.; Phillipson, M.; Manberg, A.; Hober, S.; Nilsson, P.; Thalin, C.",2021-04-06,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.01.03.21249162,2,Charlotte Thalin,"Department of Clinical Sciences, Karolinska Institute, Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.03.21249162v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.03.21249162v2.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"

ObjectiveTo compare mental and social health of children and adolescents during the COVID-19 lockdown versus before, identify associated factors, describe the change in atmosphere at home and qualitatively assess the impact of COVID-19 regulations on daily life.

DesignCross-sectional study comparing two Dutch representative samples of children and adolescents (8-18 years); before COVID-19 (Dec2017-July2018) and during the COVID-19 lockdown (April/May 2020).

SettingPopulation-based

ParticipantsChildren and adolescents aged 8-18 years (M=13.4, 47.4% male), representative of the Dutch population on key demographics.

Exposure(s)COVID-19 pandemic lockdown

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(R)) domains: Global Health, Peer Relationships, Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Anger and Sleep-Related Impairment. Single item on atmosphere at home and open question regarding the impact of the regulations on the child/adolescents daily life

ResultsChildren and adolescents reported significantly worse PROMIS T-scores on all domains (absolute mean difference range, 2.1-7.1; absolute 95% CI range, 1.3-7.9) during the COVID-19 lockdown as compared to before COVID-19. More children reported severe Anxiety (during 16.7% vs. before 8.6%; relative risk 1.95; 95% CI 1.55-2.46) and Sleep-Related Impairment (during 11.5% vs. before 6.1%; relative risk 1.89; 95% CI 1.29-2.78). Fewer children reported poor Global Health (during 1.7 vs. before 4.6%; relative risk 0.36; 95% CI 0.20-0.65). More mental and social health complaints during the COVID-19 lockdown were found in children and adolescents growing up in a single-parent family, having [&ge;]three children in the family, a negative change in work situation of parents due to COVID-19 regulations, and having a relative/friend infected with COVID-19. A small effect was found on atmosphere at home during the lockdown compared to before (mean difference, -3.1; 95% CI, -4.1 --2.1). A large majority (>90%) reported a negative impact of the COVID-19 regulations on their daily life.

Conclusions and RelevanceThis study showed that governmental regulations regarding lockdown pose a serious mental and social health threat on children and adolescents that should be brought to the forefront of political decision making and mental health care policy, intervention and prevention.

26288,Identification of risk and protective human leukocyte antigens in COVID-19 using genotyping and structural modeling,"COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The severity of COVID-19 is highly variable and related to known (e.g., age, obesity, immune deficiency) and unknown risk factors. Since innate and adaptive immune responses are elicited in COVID-19 patients, we genotyped 94 Florida patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 89 healthy controls. We identified an HLA gene, HLA-DPA1, in which specific alleles were associated with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity and COVID-19 disease. HLA-DPA1*01:03 was associated with reduced incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, whereas HLA-DPA1*03:01 was associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity. These data suggest a model in which COVID-19 severity is influenced by immunodominant peptides derived from SARS-CoV-2 preferentially presented by specific HLA-DP molecules to either protective (for asymptomatic COVID-19) or pathogenic T cells (in severe COVID-19). Although this study is limited to comparing SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative subjects, these data suggest that HLA typing of COVID-19 patients stratified for disease severity may be informative for identifying biomarkers and disease mechanisms in high-risk individuals.","Shen, Y.; Ostrov, D.; Rananaware, S.; Jain, P.

25228,Occupational risks of COVID-19 in NHS workers in England,"ObjectiveTo quantify occupational risks of Covid-19 among healthcare staff during the first wave of the pandemic in England

MethodsUsing pseudonymised data on 902,813 individuals continuously employed by 191 National Health Service trusts during 1.1.19 to 31.7.20, we explored demographic and occupational risk factors for sickness absence ascribed to Covid-19 during 9.3.20 to 31.7.20 (n = 92,880). We estimated odds ratios (ORs) by multivariable logistic regression.

ResultsWith adjustment for employing trust, demographic characteristics, and previous frequency of sickness absence, risk relative to administrative/clerical occupations was highest in additional clinical services (including care assistants) (OR 2.31 [2.25-2.37]), registered nursing and midwifery professionals (OR 2.28 [2.23-2.34]) and allied health professionals (OR 1.94 [1.88-2.01]), and intermediate in doctors and dentists (OR 1.55 [1.50-1.61]). Differences in risk were higher after the employing trust had started to care for documented Covid-19 patients, and were reduced, but not eliminated, following additional adjustment for exposure to infected patients or materials, assessed by a job-exposure matrix. For prolonged Covid-19 sickness absence (episodes lasting >14 days), the variation in risk by staff group was somewhat greater.

ConclusionsAfter allowance for possible bias and confounding by non-occupational exposures, we estimated that relative risks for Covid-19 among most patient-facing occupations were between 1.5 and 2.5. The highest risks were in those working in additional clinical services, nursing and midwifery and in allied health professions. Better protective measures for these staff groups should be a priority. Covid-19 may meet criteria for compensation as an occupational disease in some healthcare occupations.

Key messagesO_LIWhat is already known about this subject?
Healthcare workers and other keyworkers (workers whose job was considered essential to societal functioning) had a higher likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 than other workers during the first lockdown in England. Amongst healthcare workers, those working in inpatient settings had the highest rate of infection.
C_LIO_LIWhat are the new findings?
Between March and July 2000, the overall risk of COVID-19 sickness absence in National Health Service staff in England was lower at older ages, higher in non-white staff, and (in comparison with administrative and clerical staff) more than doubled in registered nurses and among workers such as healthcare assistants providing support to health professionals. Risk in health care scientists was little different from that in administrative and clerical occupations
C_LIO_LIHow might this impact on policy or clinical practice in the foreseeable future?
Our results suggest that the risk reduction strategies that were in place for healthcare scientists were effective. However, the protection for nursing and supporting health professionals was insufficient. In the event of a further  wave of infections resulting in high hospital admissions, attention should be paid to ensuring that risk reduction strategies for nurses and supporting health professionals are improved.

15026,Increased extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) reflects rapid inflammatory oedema and mortality in COVID-19 associated ARDS,"OBJECTIVENearly 5 % of the patients with COVID-19 develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) is a marker of pulmonary oedema which is associated with mortality in ARDS. In this study we evaluate whether EVLWI is higher in patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS as compared to controls and whether EVLWI has the potential to monitor disease progression.

METHODSFrom the day of intubation, EVLWI, cardiac function were monitored by transpulmonary thermodilution in n=25 patients with COVID-19 and compared to a control group of 49 non-COVID-19 ARDS-patients.

RESULTSEVLWI in COVID-19-patients was noticeably elevated and significantly higher than in the control group (17 (11-38) vs. 11 (6-26) mL/kg; p<0.001). High pulmonary vascular permeability index values (2.9 (1.0-5.2) versus 1.9 (1.0-5.2); p=0.003) suggest inflammatory oedema. By contrast, the cardiac parameters SVI, GEF and GEDVI were comparable. High EVLWI values were associated with viral persistence, prolonged intensive care treatment and mortality (23.2{+/-}6.7% vs. 30.3{+/-}6.0%, p=0.025).

CONCLUSIONSCompared to the control group, COVID-19 results in markedly elevated EVLWI-values in patients with ARDS. EVLWI reflects a non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in COVID-19 associated ARDS and could serve as parameter to monitor ARDS progression.","Rasch, S.; Schmidle, P.; Sancak, S.; Herner, A.; Huberle, C.; Schulz, D.; Mayr, U.; Schneider, J.; Spinner, C.; Geisler, F.; Schmid, R.

16772,Recovery of monocyte exhaustion is associated with resolution of lung injury in COVID-19 convalescence.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection resulting in the clinical syndrome COVID-19 is associated with an exaggerated immune response and monocyte infiltrates in the lungs and other peripheral tissues. It is now increasingly recognised that chronic morbidity persists in some patients. We recently demonstrated profound alterations of monocytes in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. It is currently unclear whether these abnormalities resolve or progress following patient discharge. We show here that blood monocytes in convalescent patients at their 12 week follow up, have a greater propensity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6, which was consistently higher in patients with resolution of lung injury as indicated by a normal chest X-ray and no shortness of breath (a key symptom of lung injury). Furthermore, monocytes from convalescent patients also displayed enhanced levels of molecules involved in leucocyte migration, including chemokine receptor CXCR6, adhesion molecule CD31/PECAM and integrins VLA-4 and LFA-1. Expression of migration molecules on monocytes was also consistently higher in convalescent patients with a normal chest X-ray. These data suggest persistent changes in innate immune function following recovery from COVID-19 and indicate that immune modulating therapies targeting monocytes and leucocyte migration may be useful in recovering COVID-19 patients with persistent symptoms.","Scott, N.

6386,Occurrence and Timing of Subsequent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Positivity Among Initially Negative Patients,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing remains the cornerstone of laboratory-based identification of patients with COVID-19. As the availability and speed of SARS-CoV-2 testing platforms improve, results are increasingly relied upon to inform critical decisions related to therapy, use of personal protective equipment, and workforce readiness. However, early reports of RT-PCR test performance have left clinicians and the public with concerns regarding the reliability of this predominant testing modality and the interpretation of negative results. In this work, two independent research teams report the frequency of discordant SARS-CoV-2 test results among initially negative, repeatedly tested patients in regions of the United States with early community transmission and access to testing.

MethodsAll patients at the University of Washington (UW) and Stanford Health Care undergoing initial testing by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab between March 2nd and April 7th, 2020 were included. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was performed targeting the N, RdRp, S, and E genes and ORF1ab, using a combination of Emergency Use Authorization laboratory-developed tests and commercial assays. Results through April 14th were extracted to allow for a complete 7-day observation period and an additional day for reporting.

ResultsA total of 23,126 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests (10,583 UW, 12,543 Stanford) were performed in 20,912 eligible patients (8,977 UW, 11,935 Stanford) undergoing initial testing by NP swab; 626 initially test-negative patients were re-tested within 7 days. Among this group, repeat testing within 7 days yielded a positive result in 3.5% (4.3% UW, 2.8% Stanford) of cases, suggesting an initial false negative RT-PCR result; the majority (96.5%) of patients with an initial negative result who warranted reevaluation for any reason remained negative on all subsequent tests performed within this window.

ConclusionsTwo independent research teams report the similar finding that, among initially negative patients subjected to repeat SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, the occurrence of a newly positive result within 7 days is uncommon. These observations suggest that false negative results at the time of initial presentation do occur, but potentially at a lower frequency than is currently believed. Although it is not possible to infer the clinical sensitivity of NP SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing using these data, they may be used in combination with other reports to guide the use and interpretation of this common testing modality.","Long, D.

8250,Evaluation of the disinfecting capacity of ozone in emergency vehicles.,"ObjectiveAs a consequence of the health crisis arising from the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic, ozone treatments are being applied as disinfectant in emergency vehicles, without objective evidence on its efficacy. Here we evaluate the efficacy of ozone treatment over bacterial strains and virus-like particles.

MethodA preparation of a lentiviral vector (lentivector) and dried cultures of two bacterial strains (gram + Staphylococcus aureus and gram - Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis) were placed inside an ambulance at two different locations. The interior of the vehicle was subjected to 10 min and 20 min treatments (3 and 6 times the recommended time by the manufacturer). Following the treatments, lentivector preparations were titrated, and viable bacteria (colony forming units, CFUs) counted and compared to pre-treatment titers and infectious CFUs of the same lysates and cultures.

ResultsNone of the treatments significantly reduced either lentivector titer or the number of viable bacteria.

ConclusionsAt least in the analyzed conditions and for the microorganisms used in this study, it can be concluded that ozone treatment is not advisable for the disinfection of emergency vehicles.","Biurrun, J.; Garcia, B.; Perez, A.; Kochan, G.; Escors, D.; Crespo, J.; Lasa, I.; Echarri, A.",2020-05-26,Emergency Medicine,10.1101/2020.05.24.20111666,1,David Escors,Navarrabiomed,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.24.20111666v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.24.20111666v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"

4355,Rapid Utilization of Telehealth in a Comprehensive Cancer Center as a Response to COVID-19,"BackgroundThe emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in March 2020 created unprecedented challenges in the provision of scheduled ambulatory cancer care. As a result, there has been a renewed focus on video consultations as a means to continue ambulatory care.

ObjectiveTo analyze the change in video visit volume at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Comprehensive Cancer Center in response to COVID-19 and compare demographics/appointment data from January 1, 2020 and in the 11 weeks after transition to video visits.

MethodsPatient demographics and appointment data (dates, visit types, and departments) were abstracted from the Electronic Health Record reporting database. Video visits were performed using a HIPAA-compliant video conferencing platform with a pre-existing workflow.

ResultsIn 17 departments and divisions at the UCSF Cancer Center, 2,284 video visits were performed in the 11 weeks before COVID-19 changes with an average (SD) of 208 (75) per week and 12,946 video visits were performed in the 11 week post-COVID-19 period with an average (SD) of 1,177 (120) per week. The proportion of video visits increased from 7-18% to 54-72%, between the pre- and post-COVID-19 periods without any disparity based on race/ethnicity, primary language, or payor.

ConclusionsIn a remarkably brief period of time, we rapidly scaled the utilization of telehealth in response to COVID-19 and maintained access to complex oncologic care at a time of social distancing.","Lonergan, P.

23300,Age-dependent immune response to the Biontech/Pfizer BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to the development of various vaccines. Real-life data on immune responses elicited in the most vulnerable group of vaccinees over 80 years old is still underrepresented despite the prioritization of the elderly in vaccination campaigns.

MethodsWe conducted a cohort study with two age groups, young vaccinees below the age of 60 and elderly vaccinees over the age of 80, to compare their antibody responses to the first and second dose of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination.

ResultsWhile the majority of participants in both groups produced specific IgG antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, titers were significantly lower in elderly participants. Although the increment of antibody levels after the second immunization was higher in elderly participants, the absolute mean titer of this group remained lower than the <60 group. After the second vaccination, 31.3 % of the elderly had no detectable neutralizing antibodies in contrast to the younger group, in which only 2.2% had no detectable neutralizing antibodies.

ConclusionOur data suggests that lower frequencies of neutralizing antibodies after BNT162b2 vaccination in the elderly population may require earlier revaccination to ensure strong immunity and protection against infection.","Müller, L.; Andree, M.; Moskorz, W.; Drexler, I.; Walotka, L.; Grothmann, R.; Ptok, J.; Hillebrandt, J.; Ritchie, A.; Rabl, D.; Ostermann, P.

22458,Ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection using exhaled breath analysis by electronic nose in a public health setting,"BackgroundRapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals is crucial for taking timely measures and minimizing the risk of further SARS-CoV-2 spread. We aimed to assess the accuracy of exhaled breath analysis by electronic nose (eNose) for the discrimination between individuals with and without a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsThis was a prospective real-world study of individuals presenting to public test facility for SARS-CoV-2 detection by molecular amplification tests (TMA or RT-PCR). After sampling of a combined throat/nasopharyngeal swab, breath profiles were obtained using a cloud-connected eNose. Data-analysis involved advanced signal processing and statistics based on independent t-tests followed by linear discriminant and ROC analysis. Data from the training set were tested in a validation, a replication and an asymptomatic set.

FindingsFor the analysis 4510 individuals were available. In the training set (35 individuals with; 869 without SARS-CoV-2), the eNose sensors were combined into a composite biomarker with a ROC-AUC of 0.947 (CI:0.928-0.967). These results were confirmed in the validation set (0.957; CI:0.942-0.971, n=904) and externally validated in the replication set (0.937; CI:0.926-0.947, n=1948) and the asymptomatic set (0.909; CI:0.879-0.938, n=754). Selecting a cut-off value of 0.30 in the training set resulted in a sensitivity/specificity of 100/78, >99/84, 98/82% in the validation, replication and asymptomatic set, respectively.

InterpretationeNose represents a quick and non-invasive method to reliably rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection in public health test facilities and can be used as a screening test to define who needs an additional confirmation test.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSElectronic nose technology is an emerging diagnostic tool for diagnosis and phenotyping of a wide variety of diseases, including inflammatory respiratory diseases, lung cancer, and infections.

As of Feb 13, 2021, our search of PubMed using keywords """"COVID-19"""" OR """"SARS-CoV-2"""" AND """"eNose"""" OR """"electronic nose"""" OR """"exhaled breath analysis"""" yielded 4 articles (1-4) that have assessed test characteristics of electronic nose to diagnose COVID-19. In these small studies the obtained signals using sensor-based technologies, two-dimensional gas chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry, or proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry, provided adequate discrimination between patients with and without COVID-19.

Added value of this studyWe prospectively studied the accuracy of exhaled breath analysis by electronic nose (eNose) to diagnose or rule out a SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with and without symptoms presenting to a public test facility. In the training set with 904 individuals, the eNose sensors were combined into a composite biomarker with a ROC-AUC of 0.948. In three independent validation cohorts of 3606 individuals in total, eNose was able to reliably rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection in 70-75% of individuals, with a sensitivity ranging between 98-100%, and a specificity between 78-84%. No association was found between cycle thresholds values, as semi-quantitative measure of viral load, and eNose variables.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe available findings, including those from our study, support the use of eNose technology to distinguish between individuals with and without a SARS-CoV-2 infection with high accuracy. Exhaled breath analysis by eNose represents a quick and non-invasive method to reliably rule out a SARS-CoV-2 infection in public health test facilities. The results can be made available within seconds and can therefore be used as screening instrument. The eNose can reliably rule out a SARS-CoV-2 infection, eliminating the need for additional time-consuming, stressful, and expensive diagnostic tests in the majority of individuals.","De Vries, R.; Vigeveno, R.

However, it is not clear when and which control measures can be relaxed during the rollout of vaccination programmes. We investigate relaxation scenarios using an age-structured transmission model that has been fitted to age-specific seroprevalence data, hospital admissions, and projected vaccination coverage for Portugal. Our analyses suggest that the pressing need to restart socioeconomic activities could lead to new pandemic waves, and that substantial control efforts prove necessary throughout 2021. Using knowledge on control measures introduced in 2020, we anticipate that relaxing measures completely or to the extent as in autumn 2020 could launch a wave starting in April 2021. Additional waves could be prevented altogether if measures are relaxed as in summer 2020 or in a step-wise manner throughout 2021.

18213,A higher ratio of green spaces means a lower racial disparity in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rates: A nationwide study of the United States,"There is striking racial disparity in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection rates in the United States. We hypothesize that the disparity is significantly smaller in areas with a higher ratio of green spaces at the county level. This study used the 135 most urbanized counties across the United States as sample sites. County level data on the SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of black and white individuals in each county were collected. The ratio of green spaces by land-cover type at the county level was calculated from satellite imagery. An ecological hierarchical regression analysis measured cross-sectional associations between racial disparity in infection rates and green spaces, after controlling for socioeconomic, demographic, pre-existing chronic disease, and built-up area factors. We found significantly higher infection rate among black individuals compared to white individuals. More importantly, a higher ratio of green spaces at the county level is significantly associated with a lower racial disparity in the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. Further, we identified four green space factors that have significant negative associations with the racial disparity in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates, including open space in developed areas, forest, shrub and scrub, and grassland and herbaceous. We suggest that green spaces are an equalizing salutogenic factor, modifying infection exposure.

16719,"Precautionary breaks: planned, limited duration circuit breaks to control the prevalence of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic in the UK has been characterised by periods of exponential growth and decline, as different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are brought into play. During the early uncontrolled phase of the outbreak (early March 2020) there was a period of prolonged exponential growth with epidemiological observations such as hospitalisation doubling every 3-4 days (growth rate r {approx} 0.2). The enforcement of strict lockdown measures led to a noticeable decline in all epidemic quantities (r {approx} -0.06) that slowed during the summer as control measures were relaxed (r {approx} -0.02). Since August, infections, hospitalisations and deaths have been rising (precise estimation of the current growth rate is difficult due to extreme regional heterogeneity and temporal lags between the different epidemiological observations) and various NPIs have been applied locally throughout the UK in response.

Controlling any rise in infection is a compromise between public health and societal costs, with more stringent NPIs reducing cases but damaging the economy and restricting freedoms. Currently, NPI imposition is made in response to the epidemiological state, are of indefinite length and are often imposed at short notice, greatly increasing the negative impact. An alternative approach is to consider planned, limited duration periods of strict NPIs aiming to purposefully reduce prevalence before such emergency NPIs are required. These """"precautionary breaks"""" may offer a means of keeping control of the epidemic, while their fixed duration and the forewarning may limit their society impact. Here, using simple analysis and age-structured models matched to the unfolding UK epidemic, we investigate the action of precautionary breaks. In particular we consider their impact on the prevalence of infection, as well as the total number of predicted hospitalisations and deaths. We find that precautionary breaks provide the biggest gains when the growth rate is low, but offer a much needed brake on increasing infection when the growth rate is higher, potentially allowing other measures (such as contact tracing) to regain control.","Keeling, M.

5769,Compositional Cyber-Physical Epidemiology of COVID-19,"COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges globally. Countries have adopted different strategies with varying degrees of success. Epidemiologists are studying the impact of government actions using scenario analysis. However, the interactions between the government policy and the disease dynamics are not formally captured.

We, for the first time, formally study the interaction between the disease dynamics, which is modelled as a physical process, and the government policy, which is modelled as the adjoining controller. Our approach enables compositionality, where either the plant or the controller could be replaced by an alternative model. Our work is inspired by the engineering approach for the design of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Consequently, we term the new framework Compositional Cyber-Physical Epidemiology (CCPE). We created different classes of controllers and applied these to control the disease in New Zealand and Italy. Our controllers closely follow government decisions based on their published data. We not only reproduce the pandemic progression faithfully in New Zealand and Italy but also show the tradeoffs produced by differing control actions.","Ro, J.

Dependent variables were: prevalence of smoking and high-risk drinking; past-year cessation and quit attempts (among past-year smokers); past-year attempts to reduce alcohol consumption (among high-risk drinkers); and use of evidence-based (e.g., prescription medication/face-to-face behavioural support) and remote support (telephone support/websites/apps) for smoking cessation and alcohol reduction (among smokers/high-risk drinkers who made a quit/reduction attempt). Covariates included age, sex, social grade, region, and level of nicotine and alcohol dependence (as relevant).

FindingsThe Covid-19 lockdown was not associated with a significant change in smoking prevalence (17.0% (after) vs. 15.9% (before), C)R=1.09[95%CI 0.95-1.24]), but was associated with increases in the rate of quit attempts (39.6% vs. 29.1%, ORadj=1.56[l.23-1.98]) and cessation (8.8% vs. 4.1%, ORadj=2.63[1.69-4.09]) among past-year smokers. Among smokers who tried to quit, there was no significant change in use of evidence-based support (50.0% vs. 51.5%, ORadj=1.10[0.72-1.68]) but use of remote support increased (10.9% vs. 2.7%, ORadj=3.59[1.56-8.23]). Lockdown was associated with increases in the prevalence of high-risk drinking (38.3% vs. 25.1%, OR=1.85[1.67-2.06]) but also alcohol reduction attempts by high-risk drinkers (28.5% vs. 15.3%, ORadr2.16[1.77-2.64]). Among high-risk drinkers who made a reduction attempt, use of evidence-based support decreased (1.2% vs. 4.0%, ORadj=0.23[0.05-0.97]) and there was no significant change in use of remote support (6.9% vs. 6.1%, ORadj=1.32[0.64-2.75]).

ConclusionsIn England, prevalence of high-risk drinking but not smoking has increased since the Covid-19 lockdown. Smokers and high-risk drinkers are more likely than before lockdown to report trying to quit smoking or reduce their alcohol consumption, and rates of smoking cessation are higher. Smokers are no less likely than before lockdown to use cessation support, with increased uptake of remote support. However, use of evidence-based support for alcohol reduction by high-risk drinkers has decreased, with no compensatory increase in use of remote support.","Jackson, S.

4187,A Scalable Method of Applying Heat and Humidity for Decontamination of N95 Respirators During the COVID-19 Crisis,"A lack of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 crisis has placed healthcare workers at risk. It is important for any N95 reuse strategy to determine the effects that proposed protocols would have on the physical functioning of the mask, as well as the practical aspects of implementation. Here we propose and implement a method of heating N95 respirators with moisture (85 {degrees}C, 60-85% humidity). We test both mask filtration efficiency and fit to validate this process. Our tests focus on the 3M 1860, 3M 1870, and 3M 8210 Plus N95 models. After five cycles of the heating procedure, all three respirators pass both quantitative fit testing (score of >100) and show no degradation of mask filtration efficiency. We also test the Chen Heng V9501 KN95 and HKYQ N95 finding no degradation of mask filtration efficiency, however even for unheated masks these scored <50 for every fit test. The heating method presented here is scalable from individual masks to over a thousand a day with a single industrial convection oven, making this method practical for local application inside health-care facilities.","Anderegg, L.; Meisenhelder, C.; Ngooi, C.

22070,IgA autoantibodies target pulmonary surfactant in patients with severe COVID-19,"Complications affecting the lung are hallmarks of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While there is evidence for autoimmunity in severe COVID-19, the exact mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we established a prospective observational cohort to study lung specific autoantibodies (auto-Abs). Incubation of plasma from severe COVID-19 patients with healthy human lung tissue revealed the presence of IgA antibodies binding to surfactant-producing pneumocytes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and protein pull-downs using porcine surfactant confirmed the presence of auto-Abs binding to surfactant proteins in severe COVID-19 patients. Mass spectrometry and ELISAs with recombinant proteins identified IgA auto-Abs that target human surfactant proteins B and C. In line with these findings, lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients showed reduced pulmonary surfactant. Our data suggest that IgA-driven autoimmunity against surfactant may result in disease progression of COVID-19.","Sinnberg, T.; Lichtensteiger, C.; Hasan Ali, O.; Pop, O.

9646,Spatial and temporal regularization to estimate COVID-19 Reproduction Number R(t): Promoting piecewise smoothness via convex optimization,"Among the different indicators that quantify the spread of an epidemic, such as the on-going COVID-19, stands first the reproduction number which measures how many people can be contaminated by an infected person. In order to permit the monitoring of the evolution of this number, a new estimation procedure is proposed here, assuming a well-accepted model for current incidence data, based on past observations. The novelty of the proposed approach is twofold: 1) the estimation of the reproduction number is achieved by convex optimization within a proximal-based inverse problem formulation, with constraints aimed at promoting piecewise smoothness; 2) the approach is developed in a multivariate setting, allowing for the simultaneous handling of multiple time series attached to different geographical regions, together with a spatial (graph-based) regularization of their evolutions in time. The effective-ness of the approach is first supported by simulations, and two main applications to real COVID-19 data are then discussed. The first one refers to the comparative evolution of the reproduction number for a number of countries, while the second one focuses on French counties and their joint analysis, leading to dynamic maps revealing the temporal co-evolution of their reproduction numbers.","Abry, P.; Pustelnik, N.; Roux, S.; Jensen, P.; Flandrin, P.; Gribonval, R.; Lucas, C.

16093,Stochastic forecasting of COVID-19 daily new cases across countries with a novel hybrid time series model,"An unprecedented outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the form of peculiar pneumonia has spread globally since its first case in Wuhan province, China, in December 2019. Soon after, the infected cases and mortality increased rapidly. The future of the pandemics progress was uncertain, and thus, predicting it became crucial for public health researchers. These future predictions help the effective allocation of health care resources, stockpiling, and help in strategic planning for clinicians, government authorities, and public health policymakers after understanding the extent of the effect. The main objective of this paper is to develop a hybrid forecasting model that can generate real-time out-of-sample forecasts of COVID-19 outbreaks for five profoundly affected countries, namely the USA, Brazil, India, UK, and Canada. A novel hybrid approach based on the Theta method and Autoregressive neural network (ARNN) model, named Theta-ARNN (TARNN) model, is developed. Daily new cases of COVID-19 are nonlinear, non-stationary, and volatile; thus a single specific model cannot be ideal for future prediction of the pandemic. However, the newly introduced hybrid forecasting model with an acceptable prediction error rate can help healthcare and government for effective planning and resource allocation. The proposed method outperforms traditional univariate and hybrid forecasting models for the test data sets on an average.","Bhattacharyya, A.; Chakraborty, T.; Rai, S.

13422,Frontline healthcare workers' knowledge and perception of COVID-19 and willingness to work during the pandemic in Nepal: a nationwide cross-sectional web-based study,"BackgroundThe health sectors effectiveness during a pandemic primarily depends on the availability, knowledge, skills, perceptions, and motivations of frontline healthcare workers. In this study, we aimed to investigate the contextual factors associated with the knowledge, perceptions, and the willingness of frontline healthcare workers to work during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal.

MethodsA total of 1051 frontline health-workers from all seven Nepalese provinces were included in this web-based cross-sectional study, which was conducted in May 2020. Using a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire, we collected information on knowledge, perceptions, and the willingness of frontline healthcare workers to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to identify independent associations between predictors and outcome variables.

ResultsOf the 1051 frontline health-workers, 17.2% were found to have inadequate knowledge on COVID-19, 63.6% reported unsatisfactory perceptions of government response, and 35.9% showed an unwillingness to work during the pandemic. Health workers at local health facilities (AOR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.17-0.68) and those with chronic diseases were less likely to have adequate knowledge of COVID-19. Nurses (AOR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.38-3.18), health-workers from Karnali Province (AOR: 2.62; 95% CI: 1.52-4.53), and those who had adequate knowledge of COVID-19 (AOR: 3.86; 95% CI: 2.51-6.16) were more likely to have satisfactory perception towards government response to COVID-19. In addition, laboratory-workers, health workers from Karnali province, and those with adequate knowledge (AOR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.27-2.58) were more likely to work during the COVID-19 pandemic.

ConclusionsWe concluded that frontline healthcare workers have some gaps in knowledge-related to COVID-19; about two-thirds of them had a negative perception of government response, and nearly one-third of them were unwilling to work. These observations demonstrate that prompt actions are required to improve health-worker knowledge of COVID-19, address negative perceptions to government responses, and motivate them to provide healthcare services during the pandemic.","Upadhyaya, D.

Previous studies indicated that the traffic conditions had significant influence on the air quality, and which was related to the respiratory diseases. This study aimed to reveal the nexus of travel restriction, air pollution and COVID-19. Shenzhen, one of the top 4 megacities in China was considered as the study area, statistical analysis methods, including linear/nonlinear regression and bivariate correlation was conducted to evaluate the relationship of the traffic and passenger population, travel intensity, NO2, PM10, PM2.5 and the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. The results suggested that traffic control and travel restriction had a significant correlation with the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases, which shown negative correlation with the traffic intensity of the city, NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 show significant positive correlation with the traffic intensity, traffic control and travel restriction would slow down and prevent the spread of the viruses at the outbreak period. Different study scale might results in different results, thus the research focused on the nexus of traffic control and travel restriction, air pollution and COVID-19 should been enhanced in future, and differentiated epidemic control and prevention measures should be considered according to the different situation of cities as well as countries.","Li, W.; Chen, X.",2020-05-07,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.04.25.20079335,2,Wei Li,shenzhen academy of environmental sciences,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079335v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079335v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
20583,"Accuracy of the Veterans Health Administration COVID-19 (VACO) Index for predicting short-term mortality among 1,307 Yale New Haven Hospital inpatients and 427,224 Medicare patients","BackgroundThe Veterans Health Administration COVID-19 (VACO) Index incorporates age, sex, and pre-existing comorbidity diagnoses readily available in the electronic health record (EHR) to predict 30-day all-cause mortality in both inpatients and outpatients infected with SARS-CoV-2. We examined the performance of the Index using data from Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH) and national Medicare data overall, over time, and within important patient subgroups.

Methods and findingsWith measures and weights previously derived and validated in a national Veterans Healthcare Administration (VA) sample, we evaluated the accuracy of the VACO Index for estimating inpatient (YNHH) and both inpatient and outpatient mortality (Medicare) using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and comparisons of predicted versus observed mortality by decile (calibration plots). The VACO Index demonstrated similar discrimination and calibration in both settings, over time, and among important patient subgroups including women, Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans. In sensitivity analyses, we allowed component variables to be re-weighted in the validation datasets and found that weights were largely consistent with those determined in VA data. Supplementing the VACO Index with body mass index and race/ethnicity had no effect on discrimination.

ConclusionAmong COVID-19 positive individuals, the VACO Index accurately estimates risk of short-term mortality among a wide variety of patients. While it modestly over-estimates risk in recent intervals, the Index consistently identifies those at greatest relative risk. The VACO Index could identify individuals who should continue practicing social distancing, help determine who should be prioritized for vaccination, and among outpatients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2, indicate who should receive greater clinical attention or monoclonal antibodies.","King, J.

24407,Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a fourplex real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays.,"The early diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections is required to identify and isolate contagious patients to prevent further transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we present a multitarget real-time TaqMan reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) assay for the quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 and some of its circulating variants harboring mutations that give SARS-CoV-2 a selective advantage. Seven different primer-probe sets that included probes containing locked nucleic acid (LNA) nucleotides were designed to amplify specific wild-type and mutant sequences in Orf1ab, Envelope (E), Spike (S), and Nucleocapsid (N) genes. Furthermore, a newly developed primer-probe set targeted human {beta}2-microglobulin (B2M) as a highly sensitive internal control for RT efficacy. All singleplex and fourplex assays detected [&le;] 14 copies/reaction of quantified synthetic RNA transcripts, with a linear amplification range of 9 logarithmic orders. Primer-probe sets for detection of SARS-CoV-2 exhibited no false-positive amplifications with other common respiratory pathogens, including human coronaviruses NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU-1. Given the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their rapid spread in some populations, fourplex rRT-PCR assay containing four primer-probe sets represents a reliable approach to detect multiple viral target sequences containing typical mutations of SARS-CoV-2 variants in a single reaction, allowing quicker detection of circulating relevant variants.","Durand, M.; Thibault, P.; Levesque, S.; Brault, A.; Carignan, A.; Valiquette, L.; Martin, P.; Labbe, S.",2021-03-26,Genetic And Genomic Medicine,10.1101/2021.03.23.21254196,1,Simon Labbe,Universite de Sherbrooke,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.23.21254196v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.23.21254196v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"

19997,CRISPR-cas13 enzymology rapidly detects SARS-CoV-2 fragments in a clinical setting,"The well-recognized genome editing ability of the CRISPR-Cas system has triggered significant advances in CRISPR diagnostics. This has prompted an interest in developing new biosensing applications for nucleic acid detection. Recently, such applications have been engineered for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Increased demand for testing and consumables of RT-qPCR assays has led to the use of alternate testing options in some cases. Here we evaluate the accuracy and performance of a novel fluorescence based assay that received EUA authorization from the FDA for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. The Specific High-Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing (SHERLOCK) technology forms the basis of the Sherlock CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit using the CRISPR-Cas13a system. Our experimental strategy included selection of COVID-19 patient samples from previously validated RT-qPCR assays. Positive samples were selected based on a broad range of cycle thresholds. A total of 50 COVID-19 patient samples were correctly diagnosed with 100% accuracy (relative fluorescence ratios: N gene 95% CI 23.2-36.3, ORF1ab gene 95% CI 27.6-45.4). All controls, including RNase P, showed expected findings. Overall ratios were robustly distinct between positive and negative cases relative to the pre-established 5-fold change in fluorescence read output. We have evaluated the accuracy of detecting conserved targets of SARS-CoV-2 across a range of viral loads using the SHERLOCK CRISPR collateral detection reaction in a clinical setting. These findings demonstrate encouraging results, especially at a time when COVID-19 clinical diagnosis is in high demand; often with limited resources. This approach highlights new thinking in infectious disease identification and can be expanded to measure nucleic acids in other clinical isolates.","Khan, W. A.; Barney, R. E.; Tsongalis, G.

MethodsWe quantified time in days from symptom onset until testing (latency one) and delay in test results report (latency two) using freely available country-wide open data from Mexico and Colombia. Directed acyclic graphs were built to determine which associations were appropriate to assess. Stratification by margination status, state and hospitalization status was used to determine corresponding associations.

ResultsIn almost all the study period latency two was longer than latency one. Median latency one was 3 (IQR 0-6) days and latency two 7 (IQR 4-11) days in Colombia, while in Mexico they were 3 (IQR 1-5) days and 4 (IQR 3-6) days. In Colombia, worse margination status prolonged latency two. In Mexico, a lower number and percentage of point-of-care (POC) tests in areas with worse margination.

ConclusionPOC tests must be used as a widespread means to reduce latency two, and until then should be prioritized in areas with longer latency two. An unequal distribution of this resource should be avoided.","Nunez, I.; Belaunzaran-Zamudio, P.

5598,Pregnancy and breastfeeding during COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review of published pregnancy cases,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic is an emerging concern regarding the potential adverse effects during pregnancy. This study reviews knowledge on the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and describes the outcome of published cases of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19.

MethodsSearches were conducted in PubMed(R) up to 8 April 2020, using PRISMA standards, to identify original published studies describing pregnant women at any gestational age diagnosed COVID-19. There were no date or language restrictions on the search. All identified studies were included irrespective of assumptions on study quality.

ResultsWe identified 30 original studies reporting 212 cases of pregnant women with COVID-19 (30 discharged while pregnant), 200 from China and 12 from other countries. The 182 published deliveries resulted in one stillbirth and 185 live births. Four women with severe COVID-19 required admission to an intensive care unit but no cases of maternal death were reported. There was one neonatal death. Preterm births occurred in 28.7% of cases, but it is unclear whether this was iatrogenic. All cases with amniotic fluid, placenta, and/or cord blood analyzed for the SARS-CoV-2 virus were negative. Four newborns were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and three newborns had high levels of IgM antibodies. Breast milk samples from 13 mothers and described in seven studies showed no evidence of SARS-CoV-2.

ConclusionThe evidence related to the effect of COVID-19 on pregnant women is still limited.

25294,Preparations of Dutch emergency departments for the COVID-19 pandemic: a questionnaire-based study,"BackgroundThe onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was characterized by rapidly increasing patient volumes, which necessitated a swift emergency department (ED) overhaul. Challenges mainly concerned surge capacity, frontline staff protection and the segregation of patients with suspected COVID-19. To date, only few studies have assessed nation-wide ED preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to form an overview of preparations that were taken in Dutch EDs during the initial phase of this public health crisis.

MethodsThis study was designed as a nation-wide, cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study among Dutch hospital organizations with [&ge;]1 ED. The questionnaire was conducted between the first and the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands and contained close-ended and open-ended questions on changes in ED infrastructure, ED workforce adaptions and the role of emergency physicians (EPs) in the hospitals crisis organization.

ResultsOverall response rate was 79.5%. All EDs had made preparations in anticipation of a possible COVID-19 surge. Treatment capacity was expanded in 69.7% of EDs, with a median increase of 49% (IQR 32.5-72.7%). COVID-19 suspected patients were segregated from non-COVID-19 patients in 86.4% of EDs. Non-COVID-19 patients were more often assessed at alternative locations than patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. In 81.8% of EDs the workforce was expanded, which mainly concerned expansion of nursing staff. A formal role of EPs in the hospitals crisis organization was reported by 93.9% of EP staffed hospital organizations.

ConclusionAll Dutch EDs made preparations for COVID-19 in a short time span and with many uncertainties. Preparations predominantly concerned expansion of treatment capacity and segregation of COVID-19 ED care.

6810,Facemasks prevent influenza-like illness: implications for COVID-19,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is causing a huge toll on individuals, families, communities and societies across the world. Currently, whether wearing facemasks in public should be a measure to prevent transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains contraversial.1 This is largely because there have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for coronavirus to directly support this. However, lessons may be taken from published RCTs examining influenza-like illness (ILI).2,3 Recent studies suggested that SARS-CoV-2 shares similar transmission route with influenza virus,4 and the incidence of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with ILI is high.5 Therefore, we undertook this meta-analysis of RCTs examining the efficacy of wearing facemasks to prevent ILI in community settings, irrespective of confirmatory testing for the causative virus.

We undertook a systematic literature search for RCTs related to facemasks and ILI between 1966 and April 2020 using PUBMED, EMBASE, and Cochrane library. RCTs undertaken in community (not hospital) settings comparing wearing and not wearing facemasks for ILI were included. Incidence of ILI (e.g., fever, cough, headache, sore throat, aches or pains in muscles or joints) was estimated per group. Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.

We screened 899 related abstracts and eventually included 8 RCTs (Figure S1). Basic characteristics and quality of included RCTs are listed in Supplement. Participants wearing facemasks had a significantly lower risk of developing ILI than those not wearing facemasks (pooled RR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.70-0.95) and there was no heterogeneity (Figure 1). The decreased risk of ILI was more pronounced if everyone wore facemask irrespective of whether they were infected or not (RR=0.77, 95% CI: 0.65-0.91), compared to those wearing facemasks when infected (RR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.58-1.56) or uninfected (RR=1.26, 95% CI: 0.69-2.31).

This study shows that wearing facemasks, irrespective of infection status, is effective in preventing ILI spread in the community. This situation mirrors what is happening now in public settings where we do not know who has been infected and who has not. Although there are no RCTs of facemasks for SARS-CoV-2, as with other simple measures such as social distancing and handwashing, these data support the recommendation to wear facemasks in public to further reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and flatten the curve of this pandemic, especially when social distancing is impractical, such as shopping, or travelling with public transport for work that cannot be done from home.","Wei, J.; Doherty, M.; Persson, M.

19870,"The effectiveness of Non Pharmaceutical Interventions in reducing the outcomes of the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK, an observational and modelling study.","Epidemiological models used to inform government policies aimed to contain the contagion of COVID-19, assume that the reproduction rate is reduced through Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) leading to physical distancing. Available data in the UK show an increase in physical distancing before the NPIs were implemented and a fall soon after implementation. We aimed to estimate the effect of peoples behaviour on the epidemic curve and the effect of NPIs taking into account this behavioural component. We have estimated the effects of confirmed daily cases on physical distancing and we used this insight to design a bevavioural SEIR model (BeSEIR), simulated different scenaria regarding NPIs and compared the results to the standard SEIR. Taking into account behavioural insights improves the description of the contagion dynamics of the epidemic significantly. The BeSEIR predictions regarding the number of infections without NPIs were several orders of magnitude less than the SEIR. However, the BeSEIR prediction showed that early measures would still have an important influence in the reduction of infections. The BeSEIR model shows that even with no intervention the percentage of the cumulative infections within a year will not be enough for the epidemic to resolve due to a herd immunity effect. On the other hand, a standard SEIR model significantly overestimates the effectiveness of measures. Without taking into account the behavioural component the epidemic is predicted to be resolved much sooner than when taking it into account.","Galanis, G.; Di Guilmi, C.; Bennett, D.

24681,Health risk behaviours among people with severe mental ill health during the COVID-19 pandemic: analysis of linked cohort data,"BackgroundPeople with severe mental ill health (SMI) experience a mortality gap of 15-20 years. COVID-19 has amplified population health inequalities, and there is concern that people with SMI will be disproportionately affected. Understanding how health risk behaviours have changed during the pandemic is important when developing strategies to mitigate future increases in health inequalities.

MethodsWe sampled from an existing cohort of people with SMI. Researchers contacted participants by phone or post to invite them to take part in a survey about how the pandemic had affected them. We asked people about their health risk behaviours and how these had changed during the pandemic. We created an index of changed behaviours, comprising dietary factors, smoking, lack of exercise, and drinking patterns. By creating data linkages, we compared their responses during pandemic restrictions to responses they gave prior to the pandemic.

Outcomes367 people provided health risk data. 47.5% of participants reported taking less physical activity during the pandemic and of those who smoke 54.5% reported smoking more heavily. Self-reported deterioration in physical health and younger age were significantly associated with an increase in health risk behaviours (adjusted OR for physical health 1.59, 95%CI 1.22-2.07; adjusted OR for Age 0.99, 95%CI 0.98-1.00).

InterpretationCOVID-19 is likely to amplify health inequalities for people with SMI. Health services should target health risk behaviours for people with SMI to mitigate the immediate and long lasting impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

22285,The protective association between statins use and adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"IntroductionStatins may reduce a cytokine storm, which has been hypothesized as a possible mechanism of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to report on adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients by statin usage.

MethodsLiteratures were searched from January 2019 to December 2020 to identify studies that reported the association between statin usage and adverse outcomes, including mortality, ICU admissions, and mechanical ventilation. Studies were meta-analyzed for mortality by the subgroups of ICU status and statin usage before and after COVID-19 hospitalization. Studies reporting an odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) were analyzed separately.

ResultsThirteen cohorts, reporting on 110,078 patients, were included in this meta-analysis. Individuals who used statins before their COVID-19 hospitalization showed a similar risk of mortality, compared to those who did not use statins (HR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.28; OR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.38, 1.03). Patients who were administered statins after their COVID-19 diagnosis were at a lower risk of mortality (HR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.61; OR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.75). The use of statins did not reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU (OR 0.65; 95% CI: 0.26, 1.64). Among non-ICU patients, statin users were at a lower risk of mortality relative to non-statin users (HR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.62; OR 0.64, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.88).

ConclusionPatients administered statins after COVID-19 diagnosis or non-ICU admitted patients were at lower risk of mortality relative to non-statin users.","Chow, R.; Im, J.; Chiu, N.; Chiu, L.; Aggarwal, R.; Lee, J.; Choi, Y.-G.; Prsic, E.

We measured 436 circulating proteins in serial blood samples from hospitalised and non-hospitalised ESKD patients with COVID-19 (n=256 samples from 55 patients). Comparison to 51 non-infected patients revealed 221 differentially expressed proteins, with consistent results in a separate subcohort of 46 COVID-19 patients. 203 proteins were associated with clinical severity, including IL6, markers of monocyte recruitment (e.g. CCL2, CCL7), neutrophil activation (e.g. proteinase-3) and epithelial injury (e.g. KRT19). Machine learning identified predictors of severity including IL18BP, CTSD, GDF15, and KRT19. Survival analysis with joint models revealed 69 predictors of death. Longitudinal modelling with linear mixed models uncovered 32 proteins displaying different temporal profiles in severe versus non-severe disease, including integrins and adhesion molecules. These data implicate epithelial damage, innate immune activation, and leucocyte-endothelial interactions in the pathology of severe COVID-19 and provide a resource for identifying drug targets.","Gisby, J.; Clarke, C.

Study DESIGNSingle-center, open label, randomised controlled trial.

SETTINGWuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China, February 27 to March 27, 2020.

PARTICIPANTS204 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were randomised in to treatment group and control group, which was 102 patients each group.

INTERVENTIONSIn treatment group, Q-14 was administrated at 10g (granules), twice daily for 14 days and plus standard care. In control group, patients were given standard care alone for 14 days.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREThe primary outcome was conversion time of SARS-CoV-2 viral assay. Adverse events were analyzed in the safety population.

RESULTSAmong 204 patients, 195 were analyzed according to the intention to treat principle. There were 149 patients (71 vs. 78 in treatment group and control group respectively) turning to negative via SARS-CoV-2 viral assay. No statistically significance showed in conversion time between treatment group and control group (FAS: Median (IQR): 10.00 (9.00-11.00) vs. 10.00 (9.00-11.00); Mean rank: 67.92 vs. 81.44; P=0.051.). Time to recovery of fever was shorter in treatment group as compared in control group. The disappearance rate of symptom in cough, fatigue, chest discomfort was significantly higher in treatment group. In chest computed tomography (Chest CT) examinations, overall evaluation of chest CT examination after treatment compared with baseline showed more patients improved in treatment group .There were no significant differences in the other outcomes.

CONCLUSIONAdministration of Q-14 on standard care for COVID-19 was useful for improvement of symptoms (such as fever, cough, fatigue and chest discomfort), while did not result in a significantly higher probability of negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 viral assay. No serious adverse events were reported.

24704,Longitudinal experiences and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among people with past or current eating disorders in Sweden,"ObjectiveTo document the impact of the COVI-19 pandemic on the health and well-being of individuals with past and current eating disorders in Sweden.

MethodWe re-contacted participants from two previous Swedish studies who had a known lifetime history of an eating disorder. Participants completed an online questionnaire about their health and functioning at baseline early in the pandemic (Wave 1; N=982) and six months later (Wave 2); N=646).

ResultsThree important patterns emerged: 1) higher current eating disorder symptom levels were associated with greater anxiety, worry, and pandemic-related eating disorder symptom increase; 2) patterns were fairly stable across time, although a concerning number who reported being symptom-free at Wave 1 reported re-emergence of symptoms at Wave 2; and only a minority of participants with current eating disorders were in treatment, and of those who were in treatment, many reported fewer treatment sessions than pre-pandemic and decreased quality of care.

ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic is posing serious health challenges for individuals with eating disorders, whether currently symptomatic or in remission. We encourage health service providers and patient advocates to be alert to the needs of individuals with eating disorders and to take active measures to ensure access to appropriate evidence-based care both during and following the pandemic.

Significant Outcomes and LimitationsO_LIIndividuals with eating disorders symptoms or current active disorder report higher adverse impact of COVID-19 on their mental health
C_LIO_LIEven individuals who were symptom-free early in the pandemic reported a resurgence of eating disorder symptoms
C_LIO_LIA large proportion of symptomatic individuals were not in treatment for their eating disorder, services should be aware and access to evidence-based care should be ensured across Sweden

5868,Beyond the Spike: identification of viral targets of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in December 2019 and caused a pandemic associated with a spectrum of COVID-19 disease ranging from asymptomatic to lethal infection. Serology testing is important for diagnosis of infection, determining infection attack rates and immunity in the population. It also informs vaccine development. Although several serology tests are in use, improving their specificity and sensitivity for early diagnosis on the one hand and for detecting past infection for population-based studies, are priorities.

MethodsWe evaluated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles to 15 SARS-CoV-2 antigens by cloning and expressing 15 open reading frames (ORFs) in mammalian cells and screened antibody responses to them in COVID-19 patients using the Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS).

ResultsThe LIPS technique allowed us to detect antibody responses in COVID-19 patients to 11 of the 15 SARS-CoV-2 antigens tested, identifying novel immunogenic targets. This technique shows that antigens ORF3b and ORF8 allow detection of antibody early in infection in a specific manner and reveals the immuno-dominance of the N antigen in COVID-19 patients.

ConclusionOur report provides an unbiased characterization of antibody responses to a range of SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The combination of 3 SARS-CoV-2 antibody LIPS assays, i.e. N, ORF3b, and ORF8, is sufficient to identify all COVID-19 patients of our cohort even at early time-points of illness, whilst Spike alone fails to do so. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of investigating new immunogens NSP1, ORF3b, ORF7a and ORF8 which may mediate immune functions other than neutralization which may be beneficial or harmful to the patient.","Hachim, A.; Kavian, N.; Cohen, C.

4966,Self-burnout - a new path to the end of COVID-19,"In this work we use mathematical modeling to describe a possible route to the end of COVID-19, which does not feature either vaccination or herd immunity. We call this route self-burnout. We consider a region with (a) no influx of corona cases from the outside, (b) extensive social distancing, though not necessarily a full lockdown, and (c) high testing capacity relative to the actual number of new cases per day. These conditions can make it possible for the region to initiate the endgame phase of epidemic management, wherein the disease is slowly made to burn itself out through a combination of social distancing, sanitization, contact tracing and preventive testing. The dynamics of the case trajectories in this regime are governed by a single-variable first order linear delay differential equation, whose stability criterion can be obtained analytically. Basis this criterion, we conclude that the social mobility restrictions should be such as to ensure that on the average, one person interacts closely (from the transmission viewpoint) with at most one other person over a 4-5 day period. If the endgame can be played out for a long enough time, we claim that the Coronavirus can eventually get completely contained without affecting a significant fraction of the regions population. We present estimates of the duration for which the epidemic is expected to last, finding an interval of approximately 5-15 weeks after the self-burnout phase is initiated. South Korea, Austria, Australia, New Zealand and the states of Goa, Kerala and Odisha in India appear to be well on the way towards containing COVID by this method.","Shayak, B.; Rand, R.

5900,How and when to end the COVID-19 lockdown: an optimisation approach,"Countries around the world are in a state of lockdown to help limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, as the number of new daily confirmed cases begins to decrease, governments must decide how to release their populations from quarantine as efficiently as possible without overwhelming their health services. We applied an optimal control framework to an adapted Susceptible-Exposure-Infection-Recovery (SEIR) model framework to investigate the efficacy of two potential lockdown release strategies, focusing on the UK population as a test case. To limit recurrent spread, we find that ending quarantine for the entire population simultaneously is a high-risk strategy, and that a gradual re-integration approach would be more reliable. Furthermore, to increase the number of people that can be first released, lockdown should not be ended until the number of new daily confirmed cases reaches a sufficiently low threshold.

We model a gradual release strategy by allowing different fractions of those in lockdown to re-enter the working non-quarantined population. Mathematical optimisation methods, combined with our adapted SEIR model, determine how to maximise those working while preventing the health service from being overwhelmed. The optimal strategy is broadly found to be to release approximately half the population two-to-four weeks from the end of an initial infection peak, then wait another three-to-four months to allow for a second peak before releasing everyone else. We also modelled an """"on-off"""" strategy, of releasing everyone, but re-establishing lockdown if infections become too high. We conclude that the worst-case scenario of a gradual release is more manageable than the worst-case scenario of an on-off strategy, and caution against lockdown-release strategies based on a threshold-dependent on-off mechanism.

The two quantities most critical in determining the optimal solution are transmission rate and the recovery rate, where the latter is defined as the fraction of infected people in any given day that then become classed as recovered. We suggest that the accurate identification of these values is of particular importance to the ongoing monitoring of the pandemic.","Rawson, T.; Brewer, T.; Veltcheva, D.; Huntingford, C.; Bonsall, M.

We demonstrate that FELUDA is 100% accurate in detecting single nucleotide variants (SNVs) including heterozygous carriers of a mutation and present a simple design strategy in the form of a web-tool, JATAYU, for its implementation. FELUDA is semi quantitative, can be adapted to multiple signal detection platforms and can be quickly designed and deployed for versatile applications such as infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19. Using a lateral flow readout within 1h, FELUDA shows 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity across all range of viral loads in clinical samples. In combination with RT-RPA and a smartphone application True Outcome Predicted via Strip Evaluation (TOPSE), we present a prototype for FELUDA for CoV-2 detection at home.

27120,Early Covid-19 Treatment With SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibody Sotrovimab,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) disproportionately results in hospitalization and death in older patients and those with underlying comorbidities. Sotrovimab is a pan-sarbecovirus monoclonal antibody designed to treat such high-risk patients early in the course of disease, thereby preventing Covid-19 progression.

MethodsIn this ongoing, multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 trial, nonhospitalized patients with symptomatic Covid-19 and at least one risk factor for disease progression were randomized (1:1) to an intravenous infusion of sotrovimab 500 mg or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with Covid-19 progression, defined as hospitalization longer than 24 hours or death, through day 29.

ResultsIn this preplanned interim analysis, which included an intent-to-treat population of 583 patients (sotrovimab, 291; placebo, 292), the primary efficacy endpoint was met. The risk of Covid-19 progression was significantly reduced by 85% (97.24% confidence interval, 44% to 96%; P = 0.002) with a total of three (1%) patients progressing to the primary endpoint in the sotrovimab group versus 21 (7%) patients in the placebo group. All five patients admitted to intensive care, including one who died by day 29, received placebo. Safety was assessed in 868 patients (sotrovimab, 430; placebo, 438). Adverse events were reported by 17% and 19% of patients receiving sotrovimab and placebo, respectively; serious adverse events were less common with sotrovimab (2%) versus placebo (6%).

ConclusionSotrovimab reduced progression of Covid-19 in patients with mild/moderate disease, was well tolerated, and no safety signals were identified.

21057,Optimal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine allocation using real-time seroprevalence estimates in Rhode Island and Massachusetts,"As three SARS-CoV-2 vaccines come to market in Europe and North America in the winter of 2020-2021, distribution networks will be in a race against a major epidemiological wave of SARS-CoV-2 that began in autumn 2020. Rapid and optimized vaccine allocation is critical during this time. With 95% efficacy reported for two of the vaccines, near-term public health needs require that distribution is prioritized to the elderly, health-care workers, teachers, essential workers, and individuals with co-morbidities putting them at risk of severe clinical progression. Here, we evaluate various age-based vaccine distributions using a validated mathematical model based on current epidemic trends in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. We allow for varying waning efficacy of vaccine-induced immunity, as this has not yet been measured. We account for the fact that known COVID-positive cases may not be included in the first round of vaccination. And, we account for current age-specific immune patterns in both states. We find that allocating a substantial proportion (> 75%) of vaccine supply to individuals over the age of 70 is optimal in terms of reducing total cumulative deaths through mid-2021. As we do not explicitly model other high mortality groups, this result on vaccine allocation applies to all groups at high risk of mortality if infected. Our analysis confirms that for an easily transmissible respiratory virus, allocating a large majority of vaccinations to groups with the highest mortality risk is optimal. Our analysis assumes that health systems during winter 2020-2021 have equal staffing and capacity to previous phases of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic; we do not consider the effects of understaffed hospitals or unvaccinated medical staff. Vaccinating only seronegative individuals avoids redundancy in vaccine use on individuals that may already be immune, and will result in 1% to 2% reductions in cumulative hospitalizations and deaths by mid-2021. Assuming high vaccination coverage (> 28%) and no major relaxations in distancing, masking, gathering size, or hygiene guidelines between now and spring 2021, our model predicts that a combination of vaccination and population immunity will lead to low or near-zero transmission levels by the second quarter of 2021.","Tran, T.

We gathered the geographic data of all publically released COVID-19 cases in China and used a case-control (1:4 ratio) design to investigate the association between having COVID-19 cases in a neighborhood and number and types of public facilities nearby. Having more restaurants, shopping centers, hotels, living facilities, recreational facilities, public transits, educational institutions, and health service facilities was associated with significantly higher odds of having COVID-19 cases in a neighborhood. The associations for restaurants, hotels, reactional and education facilities were more pronounced in cities with fewer than six million people than those in larger cities.

26132,"A Meta-analysis of Mortality, Need for ICU admission, Use of Mechanical Ventilation and Adverse Effects with Ivermectin Use in COVID-19 Patients","Importance/BackgroundDespite the global healthcares exhaustive efforts to treat COVID-19, we still do not have an effective cure for it. Repurposing Ivermectin, a known antiparasitic agent, for treating COVID-19 has demonstrated positive results in several studies. We aim to evaluate the benefit and risk of Ivermectin in COVID-19.

MethodsWe conducted a systematic search for full-text manuscripts published from February 1, 2020 to March 27, 2021 that focused on efficacy and safety of Ivermectin therapy against COVID-19. The primary outcomes were overall mortality, need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission; secondary outcomes were - adverse effects, need for mechanical ventilation. Random-effects models were used for all analysis.

ResultsWe included a total of 38 studies (n=15,002) in the qualitative analysis (Mortality N=28, ICU admission= 8, Mechanical Ventilation= 10, Adverse events=28) and out of these, 30 studies (n=11,291) were included in the quantitative analysis (Mortality N=22, ICU admission= 5, Mechanical Ventilation= 9, Adverse events=17). In the mortality meta-analysis, odds of death were lower in the Ivermectin-arm compared to the non-Ivermectin arm. (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.22-0.70; I2=81%). Subgroup analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials with severity-based data showed mortality benefit overall (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15-0.72; I2=53%) and in the mild/moderate sub-group (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03-0.33; I2=0%). Benefit of Ivermectin in decreasing; the need for ICU admission (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.17-1.37; I2=59%) and mechanical ventilation (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.40-1.04; I2=17%) was not significant. The quantitative analysis of adverse effects with Ivermectin use was inconclusive (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.64-1.33; I2=14%).

ConclusionOur meta-analysis suggests that Ivermectin could be an effective adjuvant therapy in reducing mortality, particularly in patients with mild-moderate clinical presentation of COVID-19. Trends of decreased need for ICU admissions and mechanical ventilation were observed but were not significant. The analysis for adverse effects was inconclusive.

23490,Centenarians and extremely old people living with frailty can elicit durable SARS-CoV-2 spike specific IgG antibodies with virus neutralization functions following virus infection,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2) has led to more than 114 million COVID-19 cases and >2.5 million deaths worldwide. Epidemiological analysis has revealed that the risk of developing severe COVID-19 increases with age. Despite a disproportionate number of older individuals and long-term care facilities being affected by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, very little is understood about the immune responses and development of humoral immunity in the extremely old person after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we investigated the development of humoral immunity in centenarians following a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a long-term care facility.

MethodsExtreme aged individuals and centenarians who were residents in a long-term care facility and infected with or exposed to SARS-CoV-2 were investigated for the development of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Blood samples were collected from positive and bystander individuals 30 and 60 days after original diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Plasma was used to quantify IgG, IgA, and IgM isotypes and subsequent subclasses of antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The function of anti-spike was then assessed by virus neutralization assays against the native SARS-CoV-2 virus.

FindingsFifteen long-term care residents were investigated for SARS-CoV-2 infection. All individuals had a Clinical Frailty scale score [&ge;]5 and were of extreme older age or were centenarians. Six women with a median age of 98.8 years tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Anti-spike IgG antibody titers were the highest titers observed in our cohort with all IgG positive individuals having virus neutralization ability. Additionally, 5 out of the 6 positive participants had a robust IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 response. In all 5, antibodies were detected after 60 days from initial diagnosis.

InterpretationExtreme older frail individuals and centenarians were able to elicit robust IgG and IgA antibodies directed toward SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The antibodies were able to neutralize the virus. Humoral responses were still detectable after 60 days from initial diagnosis. Together, these data suggest that recovered participants who are of extreme old age would be protected if re-exposed to the same SARS-CoV-2 viral variant. Considering the threat of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 to older age groups and long-term care facilities, the humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 in older age groups is of public health importance and has implications to vaccine responses.

13662,Integrated packages of non-pharmaceutical interventions increased public health response efficiency against COVID-19 during the first European wave: evidence from 32 European countries,"Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, governments around the World have implemented a combination of public health responses based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), with significant social and economic consequences. Though most European countries have overcome the first epidemic wave, it remains of high priority to quantify the efficiency of different NPIs to inform preparedness for an impending second wave. In this study, combining capture-recapture methods with Bayesian inference in an age-structured mathematical model, we use a unique European dataset compiled by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) to quantify the efficiency of 24 NPIs and their combinations (referred to as public health responses, PHR) in reducing SARS-Cov-2 transmission rates in 32 European countries. Of 166 unique PHR tested, we found that median decrease in viral transmission was 74%, which is enough to suppress the epidemic. PHR efficiency was positively associated with the number of NPIs implemented. We found that bans on mass gatherings had the largest effect among NPIs, followed by school closures, teleworking, and stay home orders. Partial implementation of most NPIs resulted in lower than average response efficiency. This first large-scale estimation of NPI and PHR efficiency against SARS-COV-2 transmission in Europe suggests that a combination of NPIs targeting different population groups should be favored to control future epidemic waves.","Garchitorena, A.; Gruson, H.; Cazelles, B.; Karki, T.; Sudre, B.; Roche, B.",2020-11-16,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.08.17.20174821,2,Benjamin Roche,IRD,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20174821v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20174821v2.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"

18726,Use of alternative RNA storage and extraction reagents and development of a hybrid PCR-based method for SARS-CoV-2 detection,"The COVID-19 pandemic has presented multiple healthcare challenges, one of which is adequately meeting the need for large-scale diagnostic testing. The most commonly used assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2, including those recommended by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), rely on a consistent set of core reagents. This has put a serious strain on the reagent supply chain, resulting in insufficient testing. It has also led to restricted animal testing, even though there are now multiple reports of animals, particularly cats, ferrets and minks, contracting the disease. We aimed to address the diagnostic bottleneck by developing a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection assay for cats (and, potentially, other animals) which avoids the use of most common reagents, such as collection kits optimized for RNA stabilization, RNA isolation kits and TaqMan-based RT-PCR reagents. We demonstrated that an inexpensive solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) method can be used for RNA extraction from feline samples collected with DNAGenoteks ORAcollect RNA OR-100 and PERFORMAgene DNA PG-100 sample collection kits, optimized for RNA or DNA stabilization, respectively. We developed a dual method SARS-CoV-2 detection assay relying on SYBR RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing, using the same set of custom synthesized oligo primers. We validated our tests specificity with a commercially available SARS-CoV-2 plasmid positive control, as well as two in-house positive control RNA samples. Our assays sensitivity was determined to be 10 viral copies per reaction. Our results suggest that a simple SPRI-dependent RNA extraction protocol and certain sample collection kits not specifically optimized for RNA stabilization could potentially be used in cases where reagent shortages are hindering adequate COVID-19 testing. These  alternative reagents could be used in combination with our COVID-19 testing method, which relies on inexpensive and readily available SYBR RT-PCR and non-fluorescent PCR reagents. Depending on the detection goals and the laboratory setup available, the SYBR RT-PCR method and the Sanger sequencing based method can be used alone or in conjunction, for improved accuracy. Although the test is intended for animal use, it is, in theory, possible to use it with human samples, especially those with higher viral loads.","Yang, J.; Salfati, E.; Kao, D.; Mihaylova, Y.",2020-11-24,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.11.21.20236216,1,Yuliana Mihaylova,Basepaws,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.21.20236216v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.21.20236216v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,"NA"
17030,Changes of evening exposure to electronic devices during the COVID-19 lockdown affect the time course of sleep disturbances,"Study ObjectivesDuring the COVID-19 lockdown, there was a worldwide increase in electronic devices daily usage. The exposure to backlit screens before falling asleep leads to negative consequences on sleep health through its influence on the circadian system. We investigated the relationship between the changes in evening screen exposure and the time course of sleep disturbances during the home confinement period due to COVID-19.

Methods2123 Italians were longitudinally tested during the third and the seventh week of lockdown. The web-based survey evaluated sleep quality and insomnia symptoms through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Insomnia Severity Index. During the second assessment, respondents reported the changes in the backlit screen exposure in the two hours before falling asleep.

ResultsParticipants who increased electronic device usage showed decreased sleep quality, exacerbated insomnia symptoms, reduced sleep duration, higher sleep onset latency, and delayed bedtime and rising time. In this subgroup, the prevalence of poor sleepers and clinical insomniacs increased. Conversely, respondents reporting decreased screen exposure exhibited improved sleep quality and insomnia symptoms. In this subgroup, the prevalence of poor sleepers and clinical insomniacs decreased. Respondents preserving their screen time habits did not show any change in the sleep parameters.

ConclusionsOur investigation demonstrated a strong relationship between the modifications of the evening electronic device usage and the time course of sleep disturbances during the lockdown period. Interventions to raise public awareness about the risks of excessive exposure to backlit screens are necessary to prevent sleep disturbances and foster well-being during the home confinement due to COVID-19.

Statement of SignificanceThe present investigation is the first to provide insights about the relationship between the changes in evening electronic device usage and the time course of sleep disturbances during the COVID-19 lockdown. Consistent with the well-known negative effect of backlit screen lights on circadian physiology, we demonstrated a strong relationship between the screen time modifications in the hours before falling asleep, the development and exacerbation of sleep disturbances, and the changes of sleep/wake patterns during the period of home confinement due to COVID-19 pandemic. To date, hundreds of thousands of people are subjected to restraining measures worldwide. Our findings have large scale and broad-spectrum implications, considering the unavoidable increase of electronic device usage during the current period of limited social interactions.","Salfi, F.; Amicucci, G.; Corigliano, D.; D'atri, A.; Viselli, L.; Tempesta, D.; Ferrara, M.",2020-10-21,Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology,10.1101/2020.10.20.20215756,1,Michele Ferrara,"University of L\'Aquila, Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.20.20215756v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.20.20215756v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1093/sleep/zsab080
23997,"Development and validation of the long covid symptom and impact tools, a set of patient-reported instruments constructed from patients' lived experience","ObjectivesTo develop and validate patient-reported instruments, based on patients lived experiences, for monitoring the symptoms and impact of long covid.

DesignThe long covid Symptom and Impact Tools (ST and IT) were constructed from the answers to a survey with open-ended questions to 492 patients with long covid. Validation of the tools involved adult patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 and symptoms extending over three weeks after onset. Construct validity was assessed by examining the relations of the ST and IT scores with health related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), function (PCFS, post-covid functional scale), and perceived health (MYMOP2). Reliability was determined by a test-retest. The """"patient acceptable symptomatic state"""" (PASS) was determined by the percentile method.

ResultsValidation involved 1022 participants (55% with confirmed covid-19, 79% female and 12.5% hospitalised for covid-19). The long covid ST and IT scores were strongly correlated with the EQ-5D-5L (rs = -0.45 and rs = -0.59 respectively), the PCFS (rs = -0.39 and rs = -0.55), and the MYMOP2 (rs = -0.40 and rs = -0.59). Reproducibility was excellent with an interclass correlation coefficient of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.86) for the ST score and 0.84 (0.80 to 0.87) for the IT score. In total, 793 (77.5%) patients reported an unacceptable symptomatic state, thereby setting the PASS for the long covid IT score at 30 (28 to 33).

ConclusionsThe long covid ST and IT tools, constructed from patients lived experiences, provide the first validated and reliable instruments for monitoring the symptoms and impact of long covid.

11321,SARS-CoV-2 spread across the Colombian-Venezuelan border,"IntroductionVenezuela and Colombia both adopted measures of containment early in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Venezuelas ongoing humanitarian crisis has decimated its health care system, and forced millions of Venezuelans to flee through its porous border with Colombia. The extensive shared border, and illegal cross-border transit through improvised trails between the two countries are major challenges for public health authorities. We report the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela, and present a snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic landscape in the Colombian-Venezuelan border region.

MethodsWe sequenced and assembled viral genomes from total RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal (NP) clinical specimens using a custom reference-based analysis pipeline. Three assemblies obtained were subjected to typing using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages  Pangolin tool. A total of 376 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from South America were obtained from the GISAID database to perform comparative genomic analyses. Additionally, the Wuhan-1 strain was used as reference.

ResultsWe found that two of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela belonged to the B1 lineage, and the third to the B.1.13 lineage. We observed a point mutation in the Spike protein gene (D614G substitution), previously reported to be associated with increased infectivity, in all three Venezuelan genomes. An additional three mutations (R203K/G204R substitution) were present in the nucleocapsid (N) gene of one Venezuelan genome.

ConclusionsGenomic sequencing demonstrates similarity between SARS-CoV-2 lineages from Venezuela and viruses collected from patients in bordering areas in Colombia and from Brazil, consistent with cross-border transit despite administrative measures including lockdowns. The presence of mutations associated with increased infectivity in the 3 Venezuelan genomes we report and Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genomes from neighboring borders areas may pose additional challenges for control of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the complex epidemiological landscape in Latin American countries.

6424,Safe Blues: A Method for Estimation and Control in the Fight Against COVID-19,"How do fine modifications to social distancing measures really affect COVID-19 spread? A major problem for health authorities is that we do not know.

In an imaginary world, we might develop a harmless biological virus that spreads just like COVID-19, but is traceable via a cheap and reliable diagnosis. By introducing such an imaginary virus into the population and observing how it spreads, we would have a way of learning about COVID-19 because the benign virus would respond to population behaviour and social distancing measures in a similar manner. Such a benign biological virus does not exist. Instead, we propose a safe and privacy-preserving digital alternative.

Our solution is to mimic the benign virus by passing virtual tokens between electronic devices when they move into close proximity. As Bluetooth transmission is the most likely method used for such inter-device communication, and as our suggested """"virtual viruses"""" do not harm individuals software or intrude on privacy, we call these Safe Blues.

In contrast to many app-based methods that inform individuals or governments about actual COVID-19 patients or hazards, Safe Blues does not provide information about individuals locations or contacts. Hence the privacy concerns associated with Safe Blues are much lower than other methods. However, from the point of view of data collection, Safe Blues has two major advantages:

O_LIData about the spread of Safe Blues is uploaded to a central server in real time, which can give authorities a more up-to-date picture in comparison to actual COVID-19 data, which is only available retrospectively.
C_LIO_LISampling of Safe Blues data is not biased by being applied only to people who have shown symptoms or who have come into contact with known positive cases.
C_LI

These features mean that there would be real statistical value in introducing Safe Blues. In the medium term and end game of COVID-19, information from Safe Blues could aid health authorities to make informed decisions with respect to social distancing and other measures.

In this paper we outline the general principles of Safe Blues and we illustrate how Safe Blues data together with neural networks may be used to infer characteristics of the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic in real time.

We provide near-time estimates of the statistical association between reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) and epidemiological indicators at the local area level in Germany. Our findings indicate that the 7-day incidence rates in regions with confirmed VOC cases increased by up to 35%, on average, after VOC reporting compared to regions without confirmed cases by February 4. The hospitalization rate for COVID-19 patients in intensive care increased by up to 40%, but only for regions with most reported VOC cases.

20368,Maori and Pacific People in New Zealand have higher risk of hospitalisation for COVID-19,"AimsWe aim to quantify differences in clinical outcomes from COVID-19 infection in Aotearoa New Zealand by ethnicity with a focus on risk of hospitalisation.

MethodsWe used data on age, ethnicity, deprivation index, pre-existing health conditions, and clinical outcomes on 1,829 COVID-19 cases reported in New Zealand. We used a logistic regression model to calculate odds ratios for the risk of hospitalisation by ethnicity. We also consider length of hospital stay and risk of fatality.

ResultsM[a]ori have 2.50 times greater odds of hospitalisation (95% CI 1.39 - 4.51) than non-M[a]ori, non-Pacific people, after controlling for age and pre-existing conditions. Pacific people have 3 times greater odds (95% CI 1.75 - 5.33).

ConclusionsStructural inequities and systemic racism in the healthcare system mean that M[a]ori and Pacific communities face a much greater health burden from COVID-19. Older people and those with pre-existing health conditions are also at greater risk. This should inform future policy decisions including prioritising groups for vaccination.","Steyn, N.; Binny, R.

8391,"Did the National lockdown lock COVID-19 down in India, and reduce pressure on health infrastructure?","Background & objectivesThe spread of COVID-19 in India has posed a major challenge for policy makers. Policy response in form of imposition of a prolonged national lockdown has imposed substantial costs on the entire population. But the extent to which it has contained the spread of the epidemic needs to be assessed.

MethodsWe use an Interrupted Time Series model to assess the success of lockdowns in containing COVID-19. In the second step, we use four variants of the SIR models to develop a counterfactual--what would have happened without the lockdown. These results are compared with actual data. The analysis is undertaken for India, and Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu.

ResultsLockdown has reduced the number of COVID-19 cases by 23.65 to 337.73 lakh in Class I cities and towns, where COVID has mainly spread. It has averted about 0.01 to 0.10 lakh deaths. At the regional level, however, lockdown has averted a health crisis as existing ICU and ventilator facilities for critically ill patients would have been inadequate.

Interpretation & conclusionsOverall, the results for three of the four models reveal that lockdown has a modest impact on spread of COVID-19; the health infrastructure at the national level is not over strained, even at the peak. At the regional level, on the other hand, lockdowns may have been justified. However, given that identification of new cases is limited by levels of daily testing that are low even by Asian standards, analysis based upon official data may have limitations and result in flawed decisions.","Husain, Z.; Das, A.

18341,Quantitative Assessment of Chest CT Patterns in COVID-19 and Bacterial Pneumonia patients: A Deep Learning Perspective,"As the number of COVID-19 patients has increased worldwide, many efforts have been made to find common patterns in CT images of COVID-19 patients and to confirm the relevance of these patterns against other clinical information. The aim of this paper is to propose a new method that allowed us to find patterns which observed on CTs of patients, and further we use these patterns for disease and severity diagnosis. For the experiment, we performed a retrospective cohort study of 170 confirmed patients with COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia acquired at Yeungnam University hospital in Daegu, Korea. We extracted lesions inside the lungs from the CT images and classified whether these lesions were from COVID-19 patients or bacterial pneumonia patients by applying a deep learning model. From our experiments, we found 20 patterns that have a major effect on the classification performance of the deep learning model. Crazy-paving was extracted as a major pattern of bacterial pneumonia, while Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the peripheral lungs as that of COVID-19. Diffuse GGOs in the central and peripheral lungs was considered to be a key factor for severity classification. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 91.2% for classifying COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia with 95% reported for severity classification. Chest CT analysis with constructed lesion clusters revealed well-known COVID-19 CT manifestations comparable to manual CT analysis. Moreover, the constructed patient level histogram with/without radiomics features showed feasibility and improved accuracy for both disease and severity classification with key clinical implications.","Kang, M.; Chikontwe, P.; Luna, M.; Hong, K.

18900,"Overlooked bias with thermometer evaluations using quickly retaken temperatures in EHR: applications to axillary, oral, temporal artery, and tympanic thermometry","Studies related to COVID-19 increasingly use electronic health records (EHR) to obtain large-scale evidence. However, EHR-based research must be performed with care because it can involve new study design problems that are unfamiliar to much of the medical community. Haimovich et al. (2020) sought to inform COVID-19 practice by evaluating temporal artery thermometers (TATs). They retrospectively searched EHR for temperatures measured twice within 15 minutes, including once with a TAT. The TAT often disagreed with reference measurements, so Haimovich et al. concluded TATs perform poorly. Here, we extended Haimovich et al.s study design to all other major thermometer types using the eICU Collaborative Research Database. We retrospectively identified 80,065 pairs of quickly retaken temperatures from 24,765 adult U.S. critical care patients treated in 2014-2015. We found that oral, tympanic, and axillary thermometers disagreed with reference measurements as much as TATs did. Moreover, all thermometer types showed unprecedentedly worse agreement than observed in research using other study designs: every thermometer type broke {+/-}0.9{degrees}F ({+/-}0.5{degrees}C) limits of clinically acceptable agreement by >2-fold and no type satisfied basic standards for repeatability. A natural explanation for these findings is that clinicians often retook temperatures within minutes because of user or patient errors during measurement, such as probe misplacement or patient movement. This means that quickly retaken EHR measurements do not reflect device accuracy or precision in correct use and, contrary to Haimovich et al.s conclusions, should not be used to evaluate thermometer performance or revise COVID-19 fever thresholds. Our study provides an illustrative example of unexpected study design problems that can undermine EHR-based research.","Harding, C.; Pompei, M.; Burmistrov, D.; Pompei, F.",2020-11-28,Intensive Care And Critical Care Medicine,10.1101/2020.11.24.20237958,1,Charles Harding,"Independent Statistical Analyst, Seattle, WA, USA",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.24.20237958v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.24.20237958v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.1007/s11606-021-06930-2
3486,Covid-19 Outbreak Progression in Italian Regions: Approaching the Peak by March 29th,"BackgroundItaly and especially the Lombardy region is experiencing a heavy burden of Covid-19 infection. The peak of the epidemics has not yet been reached and it is expected to be delayed in Central and Southern Italian regions compared to Northern ones. We have modeled the Covid-19 outbreak progression in Italian Regions vs. Lombardy.

MethodsIn our models, we have estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) -which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection - both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period and also by using day by day assessment, based on single observations. We used the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading of the pandemic in Italy.

ResultsThe two methods provide agreements of values, although the first method based on exponential fit should provide a better estimation, being computed on the entire time series. Taking into account the growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period, in Lombardy each infected person has involved other 5 people (4.94 base on data of March 22nd vs. 5.07 based on data of March 19th) compared to a value of R0 = 2.68 reported in the Chinese city of Whuan. According to our model and Piedmont, Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Marche reach an R0 value up to 4. The R0 is 3.7 for Lazio and 3.6 for Campania region, where this latter shows the highest value among the Southern Italian regions, followed by Apulia (3.5), Sicily (3.4), Abruzzo (3.4), Calabria (3.1), Basilicata (2.5) and Molise (2.4). The value of R0 is decreasing in Lombardy and Northern Regions, while it is increasing in Central and Southern Regions.

ConclusionThe expected peak of SEIR model can be forecast by the last week of March at national level, and by the first weeks of April in Southern Italian Regions. These kind of models can be useful for adoption of all the possible preventive measures, and to assess the epidemics progression across Southern regions as opposed to the Northern ones.","Distante, C.; Piscitelli, P.; Miani, A.",2020-04-02,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.03.30.20043612,1,Cosimo Distante,"CNR ISASI, Institute of Applied Sciences and Intelligence Systems, Lecce, Italy",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20043612v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20043612v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
18397,Central and peripheral nervous system complications of COVID-19: A prospective tertiary center cohort with 3-month follow-up,"ObjectiveTo systematically describe CNS and PNS complications in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe conducted a prospective, consecutive, observational study of adult patients from a tertiary referral center with confirmed COVID-19. All patients were screened daily for neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms during admission, at discharge and at 3-month follow-up. We classified complications as caused by SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, immune-mediated or critical illness-related.

ResultsFrom April-September 2020, we enrolled 61 consecutively admitted COVID-19 patients, 35 (57%) of whom were referred to ICU for respiratory failure. Evaluation revealed a higher frequency of CNS/PNS symptoms in ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients. The most common CNS complication was encephalopathy (n=22, 36.1%), which was severe in 13 patients (GCS[&le;]12), including 8 with akinetic mutism. Length of ICU admission was an independent predictor of encephalopathy (OR=1.23). Other CNS complications included ischemic stroke, a biopsy-proven acute necrotizing encephalitis, and transverse myelitis. The most common PNS complication was critical illness polyneuromyopathy (13.1%), with prolonged ICU stay as independent predictor (OR=1.14). Treatment-related PNS complications included meralgia paresthetica. Of 41 complications in total, 3 were classified as para/post-infectious. The remainder included cases secondary to critical illness or other causes (n=34) or without sufficient investigations (n=4). Cerebrospinal fluid was negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in all 5 patients investigated.

ConclusionsCNS/PNS complications were common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, particularly in ICU patients, and often attributable to critical illness. In cases with COVID-19 as the primary cause for neurological disease, there were no signs of viral neurotropism, but laboratory changes suggested autoimmune-mediated mechanisms.","Nersesjan, V.; Amiri, M.; Lebech, A.-M.; Roed, C.; Mens, H.; Russell, L.; Fonsmark, L.; Berntsen, M.; Sigurdsson, S.

11759,Longitudinal dynamics of the neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral agents for therapy. Little is known about the longitudinal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in COVID-19 patients.

MethodsBlood samples (n=173) were collected from 30 COVID-19 patients over a 3-month period after symptom onset and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs, using the lentiviral pseudotype assay, coincident with the levels of IgG and proinflammatory cytokines.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2-specific NAb titers were low for the first 7-10 d after symtom onset and increased after 2-3 weeks. The median peak time for NAbs was 33 d (IQR 24-59 d) after symptom onset. NAb titers in 93.3% (28/30) of the patients declined gradually over the 3-month study period, with a median decrease of 34.8% (IQR 19.6-42.4%). NAb titers increased over time in parallel with the rise in IgG antibody levels, correlating well at week 3 (r = 0.41, p < 0.05). The NAb titers also demonstrated a significant positive correlation with levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including SCF, TRAIL, and M-CSF.

ConclusionsThese data provide useful information regarding dynamic changes in NAbs in COVID-19 patients during the acute and convalescent phases.","Wang, K.; Long, Q.-X.; Deng, H.-J.; Hu, J.; Gao, Q.-Z.; Zhang, G.-J.; He, C.-L.; Huang, L.-Y.; Hu, J.-L.; Chen, J.; Tang, N.; Huang, A.-L.",2020-07-17,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.07.14.20151159,1,Ai-Long Huang,Chongqing Medical University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20151159v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20151159v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"

18774,"Optimal symptom combinations to aid COVID-19 case identification: analysis from a community-based, prospective, observational cohort","ObjectivesDiagnostic work-up following any COVID-19 associated symptom will lead to extensive testing, potentially overwhelming laboratory capacity whilst primarily yielding negative results. We aimed to identify optimal symptom combinations to capture most cases using fewer tests with implications for COVID-19 vaccine developers across different resource settings and public health.

MethodsUK and US users of the COVID-19 Symptom Study app who reported new-onset symptoms and an RT-PCR test within seven days of symptom onset were included. Sensitivity, specificity, and number of RT-PCR tests needed to identify one case (test per case [TPC]) were calculated for different symptom combinations. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm was applied to generate combinations with optimal trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity.

FindingsUK and US cohorts included 122,305 (1,202 positives) and 3,162 (79 positive) individuals. Within three days of symptom onset, the COVID-19 specific symptom combination (cough, dyspnoea, fever, anosmia/ageusia) identified 69% of cases requiring 47 TPC. The combination with highest sensitivity (fatigue, anosmia/ageusia, cough, diarrhoea, headache, sore throat) identified 96% cases requiring 96 TPC.

InterpretationWe confirmed the significance of COVID-19 specific symptoms for triggering RT-PCR and identified additional symptom combinations with optimal trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity that maximize case capture given different resource settings.

A novel pilot health surveillance programme to assess the feasibility of weekly mass RT-LAMP testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus using saliva samples collected at home was developed and piloted by the University of Southampton and Southampton City Council. Rapid qualitative evaluation was conducted to explore experiences of those who took part in the programme, of those who declined and of those in the educational and healthcare organisations involved in the pilot testing who were responsible for roll-out. This included 77 interviews and 20 focus groups with 223 staff, students, pupils and household members from four schools, one university, and one community healthcare NHS trust. Conversations revealed that high levels of communication, trust and convenience were necessary to ensure peoples engagement with the programme. This suggests community leaders and stakeholder organisations should be involved throughout programme development and implementation to optimise these features of the testing.

Among 4855 participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 in hospital, 839 were positive and of these 189 died from COVID-19. Poisson models with penalised thin plate splines were run relating exposures of interest to test positivity and case-fatality, adjusting for confounding factors. BMI was associated strongly with positive test, and risk of death related to COVID-19. The gradient of risk in relation to BMI was steeper in those under 70, compared with those aged 70 years or older for COVID-19 related death (Pinteraction=0.03). BMI was more strongly related to test positivity (Pinteraction=0.010) and death (Pinteraction=0.002) in non-whites, compared with whites. These data add support for adiposity being more strongly linked to COVID-19-related deaths in younger people and non-white ethnicities.

To evaluate strategies, it is necessary to forecast the number of cases and deaths, in order to aid the stakeholders in the process of making decisions against the disease. We propose a system for real-time forecast of the cumulative cases of Covid-19 in Brazil.

Study DesignMonitoring of all Brazilian cities using oficial information from the National Notification System, from March to May 2020, concentrated on Brazil.io databases. Training and evaluation of ARIMA and other machine learning algorithms for temporal forecasting using correlation indexes (Pearsons, Spearmans, and Kendalls) and RMSE(%). Validation from the relative errors of the following six days.

MethodsOur developed software, COVID-SGIS, captures information from the 26 states and the Distrito Federal at the Brazil.io database. From these data, ARIMA models are created for the accumulation of confirmed cases and death cases by Covid-19. Finally, six-day forecasts graphs are available for Brazil and for each of its federative units, separately, with a 95% CI. In addition to these predictions, the worst and best scenarios are also presented.

ResultsARIMA models were generated for Brazil and its 27 federative units. The states of Bahia, Maranhao, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte and Amapa, Rondonia every day of the predictions were in the projection interval. The same happened to the states of Espirito Santo, Minas Gerais, Parana and Santa Catarina. In Brazil, the percentage error between the predicted values and the actual values varied between 2.56% and 6.50%. For the days when the forecasts outside the prediction interval, the percentage errors in relation to the worst case scenario were below 5%. The states of Bahia, Maranhao, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte, Amapa, and Rondonia every day of the predictions were in the projection interval. The same happened to the states of Espirito Santo, Minas Gerais, Parana and Santa Catarina.

ConclusionThe proposed method for dynamic forecasting may be used to guide social policies and plan direct interventions in a robust, flexible and fast way. Since it is based on information from multiple databases, it can be adapted to the different realities, becoming an important tool to guide the course of politics and action against Covid-19 pandemic worldwide.","De Lima, C.

6443,"Risk of secondary infection waves of COVID-19 in an insular region: the case of the Balearic Islands, Spain","The Spanish government declared the lockdown on March 14th, 2020 to tackle the fast-spreading of COVID-19. As a consequence the Balearic Islands remained almost fully isolated due to the closing of airports and ports, These isolation measures and the home-based confinement have led to a low prevalence of COVID-19 in this region. We propose a compartmental model for the spread of COVID-19 including five compartments (Susceptible, Latent, Infected, Diseased, and Recovered), and the mobility between municipalities. The model parameters are calibrated with the temporal series of confirmed cases provided by the Spanish Ministry of Health. After calibration, the proposed model captures the trend of the official confirmed cases before and after the lockdown. We show that the estimated number of cases depends strongly on the initial dates of the local outbreak onset and the number of imported cases before the lockdown. Our estimations indicate that the population has not reached the level of herd immunization necessary to prevent future outbreaks. While the low prevalence, in comparison to mainland Spain, has prevented the saturation of the health system, this low prevalence translates into low immunization rates, therefore facilitating the propagation of new outbreaks that could lead to secondary waves of COVID-19 in the region. These findings warn about scenarios regarding after-lockdown-policies and the risk of second outbreaks, emphasize the need for widespread testing, and could potentially be extrapolated to other insular and continental regions.","Eguiluz, V.

22684,Evaluation of rapid antibody test and chest computed tomography results of COVID-19 patients: A retrospective study,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread around the world. Therefore, rapid, simpler, and more accurate diagnostic tests are urgently needed to diagnose the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 IgM/ IgG rapid antibody test results in symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and their chest computed tomography (CT) data.

MethodsA total of 320 patients admitted to our hospital for different durations due to COVID-19 were included in the study. Serum samples were obtained within 0 to 7 days from COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-PCR and chest CT scan. According to the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results, the patients included in the study were divided into two groups: PCR positive group (n=46), and PCR negative group (n=274).

ResultsOf the 320 COVID-19 serum samples, IgM, IgG, and IgM/IgG were detected in 9.4%, 3.1%, and 17.8% within one week respectively. IgG/IgM antibodies were not detected in 69.7% of the patients. In the study, it was determined that 249 (77.8%) of 320 patients had positive chest CT scans. Four (5.6%) of 100 patients with negative chest CT scan had IgM positive and 2 (2.8%) had both IgM/ IgG positive. IgM was detected in 23 (9.2%), IgG in 1 (0.4%) and IgM/IgG in 35 (14%) of chest CT scan positive patients. The rate of CT findings in patients with antibody positivity (n=97) was found to be significantly higher than those with antibody negativity.

ConclusionsThe results of the present study show the accurate and equivalent performance of serological antibody assays and chest CT in detecting SARS-CoV-2 0 to 7 days from the onset of COVID19 symptoms. When the RT-PCR is not available, we believe that the combination of immunochromatographic test and chest CT scan can increase diagnostic sensitivity for COVID-19.","Ozturk, A.; Bozok, T.; Simsek Bozok, T.",2021-02-20,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.02.15.21251772,1,Ali Ozturk,"Department of Medical Microbiology, Nigde Omer Halisdemir University Faculty of Medicine, Nigde, Turkey",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.15.21251772v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.15.21251772v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
9016,Modeling COVID-19 dynamics in Illinois under non-pharmaceutical interventions,"We present modeling of the COVID-19 epidemic in Illinois, USA, capturing the implementation of a Stay-at-Home order and scenarios for its eventual release. We use a non-Markovian age-of-infection model that is capable of handling long and variable time delays without changing its model topology. Bayesian estimation of model parameters is carried out using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. This framework allows us to treat all available input information, including both the previously published parameters of the epidemic and available local data, in a uniform manner. To accurately model deaths as well as demand on the healthcare system, we calibrate our predictions to total and in-hospital deaths as well as hospital and ICU bed occupancy by COVID-19 patients. We apply this model not only to the state as a whole but also its sub-regions in order to account for the wide disparities in population size and density. Without prior information on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), the model independently reproduces a mitigation trend closely matching mobility data reported by Google and Unacast. Forward predictions of the model provide robust estimates of the peak position and severity and also enable forecasting the regional-dependent results of releasing Stay-at-Home orders. The resulting highly constrained narrative of the epidemic is able to provide estimates of its unseen progression and inform scenarios for sustainable monitoring and control of the epidemic.","Wong, G.

10609,Assessing the nationwide impact of COVID-19 mitigation policies on the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil,"COVID-19 is now identified in almost all countries in the world, with poorer regions being particularly more disadvantaged to efficiently mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. In the absence of efficient therapeutics or vaccines, control strategies are currently based on non-pharmaceutical interventions, comprising changes in population behavior and governmental interventions, among which the prohibition of mass gatherings, closure of non-essential establishments, quarantine and movement restrictions. In this work we analyzed the effects of 707 published governmental interventions, and population adherence thereof, on the dynamics of COVID-19 cases across all 27 Brazilian states, with emphasis on state capitals and remaining inland cities. A generalized SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Removed) model with a time-varying transmission rate (TR), that considers transmission by asymptomatic individuals, is presented. We analyze the effect of both the extent of enforced measures across Brazilian states and population movement on the changes in the TR and effective reproduction number. The social mobility reduction index, a measure of population movement, together with the stringency index, adapted to incorporate the degree of restrictions imposed by governmental regulations, were used in conjunction to quantify and compare the effects of varying degrees of policy strictness across Brazilian states. Our results show that population adherence to social distance recommendations plays an important role for the effectiveness of interventions and represents a major challenge to the control of COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries.","Jorge, D.

2983,A model to estimate bed demand for COVID-19 related hospitalization,"As of March 23, 2020 there have been over 354,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in over 180 countries, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic, and the United States (US) announced a national state of emergency.1, 2, 3 In parts of China and Italy the demand for intensive care (IC) beds was higher than the number of available beds.4, 5 We sought to build an accessible interactive model that could facilitate hospital capacity planning in the presence of significant uncertainty about the proportion of the population that is COVID-19+ and the rate at which COVID-19 is spreading in the population. Our approach was to design a tool with parameters that hospital leaders could adjust to reflect their local data and easily modify to conduct sensitivity analyses.

We developed a model to facilitate hospital planning with estimates of the number of Intensive Care (IC) beds, Acute Care (AC) beds, and ventilators necessary to accommodate patients who require hospitalization for COVID-19 and how these compare to the available resources. Inputs to the model include estimates of the characteristics of the patient population and hospital capacity. We deployed this model as an interactive online tool.6 The model is implemented in R 3.5, RStudio, RShiny 1.4.0 and Python 3.7. The parameters used may be modified as data become available, for use at other institutions, and to generate sensitivity analyses.

We illustrate the use of the model by estimating the demand generated by COVID-19+ arrivals for a hypothetical acute care medical center. The model calculated that the number of patients requiring an IC bed would equal the number of IC beds on Day 23, the number of patients requiring a ventilator would equal the number of ventilators available on Day 27, and the number of patients requiring an AC bed and coverage by the Medicine Service would equal the capacity of the Medicine service on Day 21.

In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, hospitals must understand their current and future capacity to care for patients with severe illness. While there is significant uncertainty around the parameters used to develop this model, the analysis is based on transparent logic and starts from observed data to provide a robust basis of projections for hospital managers. The model demonstrates the need and provides an approach to address critical questions about staffing patterns for IC and AC, and equipment capacity such as ventilators.","Zhang, T.; Mcfarlane, K.; Vallon, J.; Yang, L.; Xie, J.; Blanchet, J.; Glynn, P.; Staudenmayer, K.; Schulman, K.; Scheinker, D.",2020-03-26,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.24.20042762,1,David Scheinker,"Stanford University School of Engineering, Stanford University School of Medicine, Lucile Packard Children\'s Hospital",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042762v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042762v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
24026,Generation of Inhibitory Autoantibodies to ADAMTS13 in Coronavirus Disease 2019,"ObjectivesIt has recently been shown that von Willebrand factor (vWf) multimers may be a key driver of immunothrombosis in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of autoreactivity, the present study investigates, whether the generation of autoantibodies to ADAMTS13 contributes to this finding.

DesignObservational prospective controlled multicenter study.

SettingBlood samples and clinical data of patients with COVID-19 were collected regularly during hospitalization in the period from April to November 2020.

Patients90 patients with confirmed COVID-19 of mild to critical severity and 30 healthy controls participated in this study.

Measuerements and Main ResultsAntibodies to ADAMTS13 occurred in 31 (34.4%) patients with COVID-19. Generation of ADAMTS13 antibodies was associated with a significantly lower ADAMTS13 activity (56.5%, interquartile range (IQR) 21.25 vs. 71.5%, IQR 24.25, p=0.0041), increased disease severity (severe or critical disease in 90% vs. 62.3%, p=0.0189), and a trend to a higher mortality (35.5% vs. 18.6%, p=0.0773). Median time to antibody development was 11 days after first positive SARS-CoV-2-PCR specimen.

ConclusionThe present study demonstrates for the first time, that generation of antibodies to ADAMTS13 is a frequent finding in COVID-19. Generation of these antibodies is associated with a lower ADAMTS13 activity and an increased risk of an adverse course of the disease suggesting an inhibitory effect on the protease. These findings provide a rationale to include ADAMTS13 antibodies in the diagnostic workup of SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Doevelaar, A. A. N.; Bachmann, M.; Hoelzer, B.; Seibert, F. S.; Rohn, B.

16338,"The Effect of Gender on COVID-19 Infections and Mortality in Germany: Insights From Age- and Sex-Specific Modelling of Contact Rates, Infections, and Deaths","BackgroundRecent research points towards age- and sex-specific transmission of COVID-19 infections and their outcomes. The effect of sex, however, has been overlooked in past modelling approaches of COVID-19 infections.

AimThe aim of our study is to develop an age- and sex-specific model of COVID-19 transmission and to explore how contact changes effect COVID-19 infection and death rates.

MethodWe consider a compartment model to establish forecasts of the COVID-19 epidemic, in which the compartments are subdivided into different age groups and genders. Estimated contact patterns, based on other studies, are incorporated to account for age- and sex-specific social behaviour. The model is fitted to real data and used for assessing hypothetical scenarios with regard to lockdown measures.

ResultsUnder current mitigation measures as of mid-August, active COVID-19 cases will double by the end of October 2020. Infection rates will be highest among the young and working ages, but will also rise among the old. Sex ratios reveal higher infection risks among women than men at working ages; the opposite holds true at old age. Death rates in all age groups are twice as high among men as women. Small changes in contact rates at working and young ages may have a considerable effect on infections and mortality at old age, with elderly men being always at higher risk of infection and mortality.

DiscussionOur results underline the high importance of the non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures in low-infection phases of the pandemic to prevent that an increase in contact rates leads to higher mortality among the elderly. Gender differences in contact rates, in addition to biological mechanisms related to the immune system, may contribute to sex-specific infection rates and their mortality outcome. To further explore possible pathways, more data on COVID-19 transmission is needed which includes socio-demographic information.","Doerre, A.; Doblhammer, G.",2020-11-20,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.10.06.20207951,2,Achim Doerre,University of Rostock,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.06.20207951v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.06.20207951v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"

24953,Higher Relative Viral Load Excretion Determined by Normalised Threshold Crossing Value in Acute Cases infected with the B.1.1.7 Lineage VOC 202012/01 (Using S gene target failure as a Proxy) When Compared to other Circulating Lineages in Wales,"Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, global monitoring of the virus using whole genome sequencing has identified mutations occurring across the viral genome. Whilst the majority have little impact on the virus, they are used effectively to monitor the movement of the virus globally and to inform locally on transmission chains.

In late 2020, a variant of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.1.7 - VOC 202012/01) was identified in the UK with a distinct constellation of mutations, including in the spike gene that increased transmissibility. A deletion in spike also affected one of the screening qPCR tests being used in the UK outside of Wales, causing a failure to detect the target. This quickly became a surrogate marker for the variant to allow rapid monitoring of the virus as it seeded into new regions of the UK.

A screening study using this assay as a proxy marker, was undertaken to understand the prevalence of the variant in Wales. Secondary analysis of a screening qPCR that didnt target the S gene and also included an endogenous control, was also performed to understand viral load excretion in those infected with the variant compared to other circulating lineages. Using a combination of analytical methods based on the Ct values of two gene targets normalised against the endogenous control, there was a difference in the excreted viral load. Those with the variant excreting more virus than those not infected with the variant. Supporting not only increased infectivity but offering a plausible reason why increased transmission was associated with this particular variant.

Whilst there are limitations in this study, the method using Ct as a proxy for viral load can be used at the population level to determine differences in viral excretion kinetics associated with different variants.","Couzens, A.; Murrell, I.; Johns, B.; Pheasant, K.; Turner, L.; Evans, J.; Moore, C.; Gifford, L.",2021-04-07,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.04.02.21254832,1,Catherine Moore,Public Health Wales,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.02.21254832v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.02.21254832v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

Detailed information on air traffic between international airports has been demonstrated to be useful in retrospectively validating and prospectively predicting case emergence in other countries. In this paper, we use a well-established metric known as effective distance on the global air traffic data from IATA to quantify risk of emergence for different countries as a consequence of direct importation from China, and compare it against arrival times for the first 24 countries. Using this model trained on official first reports from WHO, we estimate time of arrival (ToA) for all other countries. We then incorporate data on airline suspensions to recompute the effective distance and assess the effect of such cancellations in delaying the estimated arrival time for all other countries.

21260,Epidemic waves of COVID-19 in Scotland: a genomic perspective on the impact of the introduction and relaxation of lockdown on SARS-CoV-2,"The second SARS virus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in December 2019, and within a month was globally distributed. It was first introduced into Scotland in February 2020 associated with returning travellers and visitors. By March it was circulating in communities across the UK, and to control COVID-19 cases, and prevent overwhelming of the National Health Service (NHS), a  lockdown was introduced on 23rd March 2020 with a restriction of peoples movements. To augment the public health efforts a large-scale genome epidemiology effort (as part of the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium) resulted in the sequencing of over 5000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes by 18th August 2020 from Scottish cases, about a quarter of the estimated number of cases at that time. Here we quantify the geographical origins of the first wave introductions into Scotland from abroad and other UK regions, the spread of these SARS-CoV-2 lineages to different regions within Scotland (defined at the level of NHS Health Board) and the effect of lockdown on virus  success. We estimate that approximately 300 introductions seeded lineages in Scotland, with around 25% of these lineages composed of more than five viruses, but by June circulating lineages were reduced to low levels, in line with low numbers of recorded positive cases. Lockdown was, thus, associated with a dramatic reduction in infection numbers and the extinguishing of most virus lineages. Unfortunately since the summer cases have been rising in Scotland in a second wave, with >1000 people testing positive on a daily basis, and hospitalisation of COVID-19 cases on the rise again. Examining the available Scottish genome data from the second wave, and comparing it to the first wave, we find that while some UK lineages have persisted through the summer, the majority of lineages responsible for the second wave are new introductions from outside of Scotland and many from outside of the UK. This indicates that, while lockdown in Scotland is directly linked with the first wave case numbers being brought under control, travel-associated imports (mostly from Europe or other parts of the UK) following the easing of lockdown are responsible for seeding the current epidemic population. This demonstrates that the impact of stringent public health measures can be compromised if following this, movements from regions of high to low prevalence are not minimised.","Lycett, S.

13581,The basic reproduction number can be accurately estimated within 14 days after societal lockdown: The early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark,"ObjectiveEarly identification of the basic reproduction number (BRN) is imperative to political decision making during an epidemic. In this study, we estimated the BRN 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after societal lockdown of Denmark during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic.

MethodWe implemented the SEIR dynamical system for disease spread without vital dynamics. The BRN was modulated using a sigmoid function. Model parameters were estimated on number of admitted patients, number of patients in intensive care and cumulative number of deaths using the simulated annealing Monte Carlo algorithm. Results are presented with 95% prediction intervals (PI).

ResultsWe were unable to determine any reliable estimate of the BRN at 7 days following lockdown. The BRN had stabilised at day 14 throughout day 28, with the estimate ranging from 0.95 (95% PI: 0.92-0.98) at day 7 to 0.92 (95% PI: 0.92-0.93) at day 28. We estimated the BRN prior to lockdown to be 3.32 (95% PI: 3.31-3.33). The effect of the lockdown was occurring over a period of a few days centred at March 18th (95% PI: 17th-18th) 2020.

ConclusionWe believe our model provides a valuable tool for decision makers to reliably estimate the effect of a politically determined lockdown during an epidemic.","Valentin, J.

23930,Cognitive impairment and functional change in COVID-19 patients undergoing inpatient rehabilitation,"ObjectiveTo determine the frequency, magnitude, and change in cognitive impairment in patients with COVID-19 undergoing acute inpatient rehabilitation. We secondarily evaluated correlates of cognitive impairment and the relationship between cognition and functional gain.

DesignCross-sectional observational study with assessments at admission and discharge

SettingAcute inpatient rehabilitation unit within a large, urban academic medical center

Participants77 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and subsequently admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation unit between March-August 2020, 45 of whom were re-assessed at discharge.

InterventionsN/A

Main Outcome MeasuresMontreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores on admission and discharge (when available) and Quality Indicator for Self-Care (QI-SC) scores on admission and discharge.

Results62/77 (80.5%) of patients demonstrated cognitive deficits on the MoCA at admission: 39/77 (50.6%) were mildly impaired, 20/77 (26%) moderately impaired, and 3/77 (3.9%) severely impaired. Cognitive impairment was associated with a prior history of delirium, but not age or length of acute care hospitalization. 32/45 (71.1%) patients with discharge scores improved and met the MoCA minimally clinically important difference (MCID); however, 35/45 (77.8%) continued to score in the impaired range. Patients who met the MoCA MCID demonstrated significantly greater QI-SC score gains than those that did not meet the MCID (p=.02).

ConclusionCognitive impairment is common among hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring acute inpatient rehabilitation. Cognitive impairment improves over the course of inpatient rehabilitation, and is associated with functional gain. Nonetheless, cognitive deficits frequently remain present at discharge, indicating the need for systematic assessment and follow-up, especially given the association with functional outcome.","Patel, R.; Savrides, I.; Cahalan, C.; Doulatani, G.; O'dell, M.

17556,Association of Mass Gatherings and COVID-19 Hospitalization,"We examined COVID-19 hospitalizations following mass gatherings in Wisconsin and Minnesota, United States (September 17-18, 2020). We found that the hospitalization rate increased 15-fold in the Minnesota gathering county, and 12.7-fold in the Wisconsin gathering county. On the state level, it increased 2-fold in Minnesota, and 2.3-fold in Wisconsin, while not increasing significantly in states without gatherings. Our findings suggest that mass gatherings are followed by increased COVID-19 hospitalizations, and that precautions should be taken.","Miron, O.; Yu, K.-H.; Wilf-Miron, R.; Davidovitch, N.",2020-11-03,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.10.27.20220707,1,Oren Miron,Ben Gurion University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.27.20220707v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.27.20220707v1.full.pdf,cc_by,"NA"
22065,Age-related heterogeneity in Neutralising antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 following BNT162b2 vaccination,"Two dose mRNA vaccination provides excellent protection against SARS-CoV-2. However, there are few data on vaccine efficacy in elderly individuals above the age of 801. Additionally, new variants of concern (VOC) with reduced sensitivity to neutralising antibodies have raised fears for vulnerable groups. Here we assessed humoral and cellular immune responses following vaccination with mRNA vaccine BNT162b22 in elderly participants prospectively recruited from the community and younger health care workers. Median age was 72 years and 51% were females amongst 140 participants. Neutralising antibody responses after the first vaccine dose diminished with increasing age, with a marked drop in participants over 80 years old. Sera from participants below and above 80 showed significantly lower neutralisation potency against B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1. variants of concern as compared to wild type. Those over 80 were more likely to lack any neutralisation against VOC compared to younger participants following first dose. The adjusted odds ratio for inadequate neutralisation activity against the B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.351 variant in the older versus younger age group was 4.3 (95% CI 2.0-9.3, p<0.001), 6.7 (95% CI 1.7-26.3, p=0.008) and 1.7 (95% CI 0.5-5.7, p=0.41). Binding IgG and IgA antibodies were lower in the elderly, as was the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 Spike specific B-memory cells. We observed a trend towards lower somatic hypermutation in participants with suboptimal neutralisation, and elderly participants demonstrated clear reduction in class switched somatic hypermutation, driven by the IgA1/2 isotype. SARS-CoV-2 Spike specific T-cell IFN{gamma} and IL-2 responses fell with increasing age, and both cytokines were secreted primarily by CD4 T cells. We conclude that the elderly are a high risk population that warrant specific measures in order to mitigate against vaccine failure, particularly where variants of concern are circulating.","Collier, D.; Ferreira, I.; Datir, R.; Kotagiri, P.; Lim, E.; Meng, B.; The Citiid-Nihr Bioresource Covid-19 Collaboration,  ; Elmer, A.; Kingston, N.; Graves, B.; Graves, B.; Smith, K.

21313,REACT-1 round 8 interim report: SARS-CoV-2 prevalence during the initial stages of the third national lockdown in England,"BackgroundHigh prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in many northern hemisphere populations is causing extreme pressure on healthcare services and leading to high numbers of fatalities. Even though safe and effective vaccines are being deployed in many populations, the majority of those most at-risk of severe COVID-19 will not be protected until late spring, even in countries already at a more advanced stage of vaccine deployment.

MethodsThe REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission study-1 (REACT-1) obtains throat and nose swabs from between 120,000 and 180,000 people in the community in England at approximately monthly intervals. Round 8a of REACT-1 mainly covers a period from 6th January 2021 to 15th January 2021. Swabs are tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus and patterns of swab-positivity are described over time, space and with respect to individual characteristics. We compare swab-positivity prevalence from REACT-1 with mobility data based on the GPS locations of individuals using the Facebook mobile phone app. We also compare results from round 8a with those from round 7 in which swabs were collected from 13th November to 24th November (round 7a) and 25th November to 3rd December 2020 (round 7b).

ResultsIn round 8a, we found 1,962 positives from 142,909 swabs giving a weighted prevalence of 1.58% (95% CI, 1.49%, 1.68%). Using a constant growth model, we found no strong evidence for either growth or decay averaged across the period; rather, based on data from a limited number of days, prevalence may have started to rise at the end of round 8a. Facebook mobility data showed a marked decrease in activity at the end of December 2020, followed by a rise at the start of the working year in January 2021. Between round 7b and round 8a, prevalence increased in all adult age groups, more than doubling to 0.94% (0.83%, 1.07%) in those aged 65 and over. Large household size, living in a deprived neighbourhood, and Black and Asian ethnicity were all associated with increased prevalence. Both healthcare and care home workers, and other key workers, had increased odds of swab-positivity compared to other workers.

ConclusionDuring the initial 10 days of the third COVID-19 lockdown in England in January 2021, prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was very high with no evidence of decline. Until prevalence in the community is reduced substantially, health services will remain under extreme pressure and the cumulative number of lives lost during this pandemic will continue to increase rapidly.","Riley, S.; Ainslie, K.

19684,Diverse Functional Autoantibodies in Patients with COVID-19,"COVID-19 manifests with a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes that are characterized by exaggerated and misdirected host immune responses1-8. While pathological innate immune activation is well documented in severe disease1, the impact of autoantibodies on disease progression is less defined. Here, we used a high-throughput autoantibody discovery technique called Rapid Extracellular Antigen Profiling (REAP) to screen a cohort of 194 SARS-CoV-2 infected COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers for autoantibodies against 2,770 extracellular and secreted proteins (the """"exoproteome""""). We found that COVID-19 patients exhibit dramatic increases in autoantibody reactivities compared to uninfected controls, with a high prevalence of autoantibodies against immunomodulatory proteins including cytokines, chemokines, complement components, and cell surface proteins. We established that these autoantibodies perturb immune function and impair virological control by inhibiting immunoreceptor signaling and by altering peripheral immune cell composition, and found that murine surrogates of these autoantibodies exacerbate disease severity in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of autoantibodies against tissue-associated antigens revealed associations with specific clinical characteristics and disease severity. In summary, these findings implicate a pathological role for exoproteome-directed autoantibodies in COVID-19 with diverse impacts on immune functionality and associations with clinical outcomes.","Wang, E.

ObjectiveTo determine risk factors associated with hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality among patients with confirmed COVID-19.

DesignA retrospective cohort study.

SettingFulton County in Atlanta Metropolitan Area, Georgia, U.S.

PatientsCommunity-based individuals of all ages that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

MeasurementsDemographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, hospitalization, ICU admission, death (all-cause mortality), and severe COVID-19 disease, defined as a composite measure of hospitalization and death.

ResultsBetween March 2 and May 31, 2020, we included 4322 individuals with various COVID-19 outcomes. In a multivariable logistic regression random-effects model, patients in age groups [&ge;]45 years compared to those <25 years were associated with severe COVID-19. Males compared to females (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-1.6), non-Hispanic blacks (aOR 1.9, 95%CI: 1.5-2.4) and Hispanics (aOR 1.7, 95%CI: 1.2-2.5) compared to non-Hispanic whites were associated with increased odds of severe COVID-19. Those with chronic renal disease (aOR 3.6, 95%CI: 2.2-5.8), neurologic disease (aOR 2.8, 95%CI: 1.8-4.3), diabetes (aOR 2.0, 95%CI: 1.5-2.7), chronic lung disease (aOR 1.7, 95%CI: 1.2-2.3), and """"other chronic diseases"""" (aOR 1.8, 95%CI: 1.3-2.6) compared to those without these conditions were associated with increased odds of having severe COVID-19.

ConclusionsMultiple risk factors for hospitalization, ICU admission, and death were observed in this cohort from an urban setting in the southeast U.S. Improved screening and early, intensive treatment for persons with identified risk factors is urgently needed to reduce COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality.","Chishinga, N.; Gandhi, N.

24715,Returning to the workplace during the COVID-19 pandemic: The concerns of Australian workers,"PurposeTo determine the nature and prevalence of workers concerns regarding workplaces reopening during the pandemic. To identify characteristics of workers and industries where particular concerns are more common.

MethodsProspective cohort study of 1063 employed Australian adults, enrolled at the start of the pandemic. Data on attitudes to workplaces reopening were collected 1 July - 30 September 2020. The frequency of concerns describes infection risk and changes to work and impact on home life. Regression models examined associations between demographic and industry factors with reopening concerns.

ResultsMore than four in five (82.4%) of workers reported concerns about workplace infection risk. Just over half (53.4%) reported concerns about impacts to work and home life. Concerns were more prevalent for workers reporting psychological distress, financial stress, and among those exclusively working from home. Concerns regarding infection risk were common for workers in health care (IRR=1.16, 95% CI=[1.01, 1.33]), retail (IRR=1.31, 95% CI=[1.06, 1.61]), and accommodation/food service industries (IRR=1.25, 95% CI=[1.01, 1.55]). Concerns regarding changes to work and home life were more common for female workers (IRR=1.24, 95% CI=[1.07, 1.43]), and partners/spouses with dependent children (IRR=1.44, 95% CI=[1.16, 1.79]).

ConclusionConcerns of COVID-19 infection in the workplace are common. Many workers are also concerned about changes to their work and home life. The prevalence of concerns is related to the nature of work and responsibilities at home. Actions that reduce risk of workplace transmission, coupled with effective communication of infection controls, may alleviate worker concerns whilst recognising workers family and social circumstances.","Griffiths, D.; Sheehan, L.; Van Vreden, C.; Whiteford, P.; Collie, A.",2021-03-31,Occupational And Environmental Health,10.1101/2021.03.28.21254520,1,Alex Collie,Monash University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.28.21254520v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.28.21254520v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1007/s10926-021-09990-7
24977,Statistical Modeling of deaths due to COVID-19 influenced by social isolation in Latin American countries,"Social isolation is extremely important to minimize the effects of a pandemic. Latin American (LA) countries have similar socioeconomic characteristics and health system infrastructures. These countries face difficulties to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and some of them had very high death rates. Government stringency index (GSI) of twelve LA countries was gathered from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) project. GSI was calculated considering nine metrics such as school and work closures, stay-at-home requirements, among others types of social distancing and isolation measures. Population data from the United Nations Population Fund and number of deaths data was collected from the dashboard of the World Health Organization (WHO). We performed an analysis of the period March-December using a mixed linear model approach. Peru, Brazil, Chile, Bolivia, Colombia, Argentina and Ecuador had the highest death rates with an increasing trend over time, while Suriname, Venezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay and Guyana had the lowest ones, which remained steady. GSI in most countries followed the same pattern during the analyzed months. i.e., high indices at the beginning of the pandemic and lower ones in the last evaluated months, while the number of deaths increased over the whole period. Almost no country kept its GSI high for much time, especially from October to December. Time and GSI as well as their interaction were highly significant. As their interaction increases, death rate decreases. In conclusion, our statistical model explains and substantiates the need for maintaining social distancing and isolation measures over time during the pandemic.","Silva, R. A. D.; Ferreira, L. P. D.

We examined determinants of COVID symptoms, defined as fever plus difficulty breathing/shortness of breath, dry cough so severe that it disrupts sleep, and/or loss of sense of smell; and testing for SARS-CoV-2 by respondents and/or household members. About 8% of Canadians reported that they and/or one or more household members experienced COVID symptoms. Symptoms were more common in younger than older adults, and among visible minorities. Overall, only 3% of respondents and/or household members reported testing for SARS-CoV-2. Being tested was associated with having COVID symptoms, Indigenous identity, and living in Quebec. Periodic nationally representative surveys--including high-risk older populations--of symptoms, as well as SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, are required in many countries to understand the pandemic and prepare for the future.","Wu, D.

14026,Temporal increase in D614G mutation of SARS-CoV-2 in the Middle East and North Africa: Phylogenetic and mutation analysis study,"Phylogeny construction can help to reveal evolutionary relatedness among molecular sequences. The spike (S) gene of SARS-CoV-2 is the subject of an immune selective pressure which increases the variability in such region. This study aimed to identify mutations in the S gene among SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), focusing on the D614G mutation, that has a presumed fitness advantage. Another aim was to analyze the S gene sequences phylogenetically. The SARS-CoV-2 S gene sequences collected in the MENA were retrieved from the GISAID public database, together with its metadata. Mutation analysis was conducted in Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software. Phylogenetic analysis was done using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods. A total of 553 MENA sequences were analyzed and the most frequent S gene mutations included: D614G = 435, Q677H = 8, and V6F = 5. A significant increase in the proportion of D614G was noticed from (63.0%) in February 2020, to (98.5%) in June 2020 (p< 0.001). Two large phylogenetic clusters were identified via ML analysis, which showed an evidence of inter-country mixing of sequences, which dated back to February 8, 2020 and March 15, 2020 (median estimates).

25342,"High prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (UK variant) and the novel B.1.525 lineage in Oyo State, Nigeria","The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced transmissibility or decreased susceptibility to immune responses is a major threat to global efforts to end the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Disparities in viral genomic surveillance capabilities and efforts have resulted in gaps in our understanding of the viral population dynamics across the globe. Nigeria, despite having the largest population of any nation in Africa, has had relatively little SARS-CoV-2 sequence data made publicly available. Here we report the whole-genome sequences of 74 SARS-CoV-2 isolates collected from individuals in Oyo State, Nigeria in January 2021. Most isolates belonged to either the B.1.1.7 Alpha """"variant of concern"""" or the B.1.525 Eta lineage, which is currently considered a """"variant of interest"""" containing multiple spike protein mutations previously associated with enhanced transmissibility and possible immune escape. Nigeria has the highest reported frequency of the B.1.525 lineage globally with phylogenetic characteristics consistent with a recent monophyletic origin and rapid expansion. Spike protein from the B.1.525 lineage displayed both increased infectivity and decreased neutralization by convalescent sera compared to Spike proteins from other clades. These results, along with indications that the virus is outpacing the B.1.1.7 lineage in Nigeria, suggest that the B.1.525 lineage represents another """"variant of concern"""" and further underline the importance of genomic surveillance in undersampled regions across the globe.","Ozer, E.

21029,Mass Testing with Contact Tracing Compared to Test and Trace for Effective Suppression of COVID-19 in the UK: A rapid review,"BackgroundMaking testing available to everyone and tracing contacts might be the gold standard towards the control of COVID-19, particularly when significant transmissions are without symptoms. This study evaluated the effectiveness of mass testing and contact tracing in the suppression of COVID-19 compared to conventional Test and Trace in the UK.

DesignA rapid review of available evidence

Primary research questionIs there evidence that mass testing and tracing could suppress community spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections better than Test and Trace?

Secondary research questionWhat is the proportion of asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 reported during mass testing interventions?

MethodsLiterature was searched in September through December 2020 in Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Mendeley and PubMed.

ResultsLiterature search yielded 286 articles from Google Scholar, 20 from Science Direct, 14 from Mendeley, 27 from Pubmed and 15 through manual search. Altogether 35 articles were included, making a sample size of close to a million participants.

ConclusionThere was a very low level but promising evidence of 76.9% (95% CI: 46.2 - 95.0, P=0.09) majority vote in favour of the intervention under the primary objective. The overall proportion of asymptomatic cases among those tested positive and tested sample populations under the secondary objective was 40.7% (95% CI: 38.8- 42.5) and 0.01% (95% CI: 0.01 - 0.012) respectively.

2249,Validity of Wrist and Forehead Temperature in Temperature Screening in the General Population During the Outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus: a prospective real-world study,"AimsTemperature screening is important in the population during the outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). This study aimed to compare the accuracy and precision of wrist and forehead temperature with tympanic temperature under different circumstances.

MethodsWe performed a prospective observational study in a real-life population. We consecutively collected wrist and forehead temperatures in Celsius ({degrees}C) using a non-contact infrared thermometer (NCIT). We also measured the tympanic temperature using a tympanic thermometers (IRTT) and defined fever as a tympanic temperature [&ge;]37.3{degrees}C.

ResultsWe enrolled a total of 528 participants including 261 indoor and 267 outdoor participants. We divided outdoor participants into four types according to their means of transportation to the hospital as walk, bicycle, electric vehicle, car, and inside the car. Under different circumstance, the mean difference ranged from -1.72 to -0.56{degrees}C in different groups for the forehead measurements, and -0.96 to -0.61{degrees}C for the wrist measurements. Both measurements had high fever screening abilities in inpatients (wrist: AUC 0.790; 95% CI: 0.725-0.854, P <0.001; forehead: AUC 0.816; 95% CI: 0.757-0.876, P <0.001). The cut-off value of wrist measurement for detecting tympanic temperature [&ge;]37.3{degrees}C was 36.2{degrees}C with a 86.4% sensitivity and a 67.0% specificity, and the best threshold of forehead measurement was also 36.2{degrees}C with a 93.2% sensitivity and a 60.0% specificity.

ConclusionsWrist measurement is more stable than forehead measurement under different circumstance. Both measurements have great fever screening abilities for indoor patients. The cut-off value of both measurements was 36.2{degrees}C.

19901,Exposure to Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibitors Is Associated with Reduced Mortality of Older Hypertensive Covid-19 Patients,"From a cohort of 1352 consecutive patients admitted with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, Italy, between February and April 2020, we selected and studied 688 patients with arterial hypertension (254 deaths) to assess whether use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASIs) prior to hospital admission affects mortality from Covid-19. Prior use of RASIs was associated with a lower mortality in the over-68 group of patients, whereas no evidence of a similar effect (whether protective or adverse) was found in the younger group. There was positive relative excess due to a statistically significant (p =0.001) interaction between prior RASI exposure and an age greater than 68 years, corresponding to a positive relative excess risk. Next we used the subgroup of 411 hypertensive patients older than 68 yrs to separately assess the effects prior use of two RASI drug subclasses, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiogiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), by comparing these two exposures with no exposure to RASIs. We found both prior use of ACEIs and prior use of ARBs to be associated with a lower Covid-19 mortality, after adjusting for 32 medical history variables via propensity score matching.

2259,"Clinical characteristics of 101 COVID-19 nonsurvivors in Wuhan, China: a retrospective study","BackgroundThe outbreak of COVID-19 has aroused global concerns. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 nonsurvivors and analyze possible causes for the rapid disease progress to death.

MethodsPatients with confirmed COVID-19 died in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University before February 15, 2020, were identified. We obtained epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data from electronic medical records.

ResultsAmong 101 nonsurvivors, the median age was 71.0 years (IQR, 59.0-80.0), 59.4% were male, 79.2% had one or more comorbidities including hypertension (58.4%), cardiovascular disease (22.8%), diabetes (20.8%) etc. The most common symptoms were fever (76.2%), cough (58.4%) and dyspnea (54.5%). Respiratory failure (99.0%), acute cardiac injury (52.5%), sepsis (40.6%) and acute kidney injury (23.8%) were most common complications. Compared with patients died after 3 days of admission, patients died within 3 days of admission had significantly higher white blood cell count (10.8 vs 6.7x109/L, P=0.001) and neutrophil count (8.9 vs 5.5x109/L, P=0.001), longer prothrombin time (13.2 vs 12.5 s, P=0.040), higher D-dimer concentration (7.64 vs 2.82, P=0.040), higher lactate level (2.9 vs 2.2 mmol/L, P=0.042), lower oxygen saturation (85.0% vs 91.0%, P=0.008), and were more likely to suffer sepsis (52.1% vs 30.2%, P=0.025).

ConclusionsOlder patients with underlying comorbidities suffering COVID-19 were at high risk of death. Respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury played crucial roles in the death of COVID-19 patients.

9093,Forward-looking serial intervals correctly link epidemic growth to reproduction numbers,"Generation intervals and serial intervals are critical quantities for characterizing outbreak dynamics. Generation intervals characterize the time between infection and transmission, while serial intervals characterize the time between the onset of symptoms in a chain of transmission. They are often used interchangeably, leading to misunderstanding of how these intervals link the epidemic growth rate r and the reproduction number[R] . Generation intervals provide a mechanistic link between r and[R] but are harder to measure via contact tracing. While serial intervals are easier to measure from contact tracing, recent studies suggest that the two intervals give different estimates of[R] from r. We present a general framework for characterizing epidemiological delays based on cohorts (i.e., a group of individuals that share the same event time, such as symptom onset) and show that forward-looking serial intervals, which correctly link[R] with r, are not the same as """"intrinsic"""" serial intervals, but instead change with r. We provide a heuristic method for addressing potential biases that can arise from not accounting for changes in serial intervals across cohorts and apply the method to estimating[R] for the COVID-19 outbreak in China using serial-interval data -- our analysis shows that using incorrectly defined serial intervals can severely bias estimates. This study demonstrates the importance of early epidemiological investigation through contact tracing and provides a rationale for reassessing generation intervals, serial intervals, and[R] estimates, for COVID-19.

Significance StatementThe generation- and serial-interval distributions are key, but different, quantities in outbreak analyses. Recent theoretical studies suggest that two distributions give different estimates of the reproduction number[R] from the exponential growth rate r; however, both intervals, by definition, describe disease transmission at the individual level. Here, we show that the serial-interval distribution, defined from the correct reference time and cohort, gives the same estimate of[R] as the generation-interval distribution. We then apply our framework to serial-interval data from the COVID-19 outbreak in China. While our study supports the use of serial-interval distributions in estimating[R] , it also reveals necessary changes to the current understanding and applications of serial-interval distribution.","Park, S.

9701,Analysis of the time evolution of SARS-CoV-2 lethality rate in Italy: Evidence of an unaltered virus potency,"In recent months, the entire world is facing a dramatic health emergency caused by the diffusion of a hitherto unknown coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Despite the efforts, the understanding of the many facets of the pandemic is still rather limited. In the present manuscript, we have monitored the evolution of the lethality rate in Italy by using the data collected over the last three months. Our data indicate that there is a striking correlation between the number of infected people of a certain week and the deaths of the following one. Despite the overall simplicity of the applied approach and its many approximations, the analysis of the Italian scenario provides some interesting insights into the pandemic. Indeed, we have found that the lethality rate is virtually unchanged over the last two months. This implies that the reduction of the deaths is strictly connected to the decrease of cases. Unfortunately, the present study does not support the idea that the virus potency has lowered in the last weeks, as our data demonstrate that the likelihood of a fatal outcome after the infection has not decreased in the recent outbreak evolution. Moreover, we show that the lethality rate is still very high in the country ({approx}13.5%). Since this number is remarkably higher if compared to the actual lethality estimates made worldwide, this finding suggests that the number of detected cases may be a gross underestimation of the actual infected people, likely due to the presence of a significant number of non-symptomatic or paucisymptomatic individuals in the population.","Balasco, N.; D'alessandro, V.; Smaldone, G.; Vitagliano, L.",2020-06-14,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.12.20129387,1,Luigi Vitagliano,Italian National Research Council,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.20129387v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.20129387v1.full.pdf,cc_by,"NA"

It can be observed that currently in India the spread pattern is nearly exponential. It can be seen further that the number of cases is still continuing to grow very fast.

In most countries, rigorous measures of mitigation, including national or subnational lockdowns were established. The present work aimed at quantifying the effect of national lockdown in France on hospital occupancy.

MethodsA compartmental model describing patient hospital flows was developed, where the effect of lockdown was quantified on the hospitalization rate. Model parameters were estimated using nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) modelling.

ResultsFrench lockdown led to a hospitalization rate decreased by thrice from 12 days after its beginning. However, lockdown may not to have decreased either hospital occupancy or deaths in hospital, which would have been both decreased by 30% and 85% in average if lockdown was started 20 and 30 days before this date, respectively.

23639,Universal Rule for Covid 19 and Herd Immunity in the US,"A new Universal rule for Covid 19 data is derived in this paper using the SIR model.

It relates infection and removal rates and is validated by the global Covid 19 data. Over 186,000 data points, from 190 countries and the states of the US, for the period April 1 to December 12, 2020 - fall on a single line, as the Universal rule predicts, transcending geography, ethnicity and race.

The Universal rule requires that Herd immunity begin when just 25% of the population is vaccinated. With the anticipated 100 million vaccinations in the first 100 days of the Biden administration, Herd immunity may be imminent in the US.

The Universal rule promotes a temporary stasis with continuing infections and hospitalizations and becomes a barrier to runaway infections, making it practically impossible to reach Herd immunity, as Sweden discovered. Reduced infected population seems to be a third option to stifle the epidemic - a little known accomplishment, first by North Dakota and subsequently by twelve other U.S. states, including South Dakota.","Kuriyan, J.",2021-03-12,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.03.05.21251577,1,Jacob Kuriyan,Physmark,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.05.21251577v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.05.21251577v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,"NA"
27947,Common and rare variant analyses combined with single-cell multiomics reveal cell-type-specific molecular mechanisms of COVID-19 severity,"The determinants of severe COVID-19 in non-elderly adults are poorly understood, which limits opportunities for early intervention and treatment. Here we present novel machine learning frameworks for identifying common and rare disease-associated genetic variation, which outperform conventional approaches. By integrating single-cell multiomics profiling of human lungs to link genetic signals to cell-type-specific functions, we have discovered and validated over 1,000 risk genes underlying severe COVID-19 across 19 cell types. Identified risk genes are overexpressed in healthy lungs but relatively downregulated in severely diseased lungs. Genetic risk for severe COVID-19, within both common and rare variants, is particularly enriched in natural killer (NK) cells, which places these immune cells upstream in the pathogenesis of severe disease. Mendelian randomization indicates that failed NKG2D-mediated activation of NK cells leads to critical illness. Network analysis further links multiple pathways associated with NK cell activation, including type-I-interferon-mediated signalling, to severe COVID-19. Our rare variant model, PULSE, enables sensitive prediction of severe disease in non-elderly patients based on whole-exome sequencing; individualized predictions are accurate independent of age and sex, and are consistent across multiple populations and cohorts. Risk stratification based on exome sequencing has the potential to facilitate post-exposure prophylaxis in at-risk individuals, potentially based around augmentation of NK cell function. Overall, our study characterizes a comprehensive genetic landscape of COVID-19 severity and provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of severe disease, leading to new therapeutic targets and sensitive detection of at-risk individuals.","Zhang, S.; Cooper-Knock, J.; Weimer, A.; Harvey, C.; Julian, T.; Wang, C.; Li, J.; Furini, S.; Frullanti, E.; Fava, F.; Renieri, A.; Pan, C.; Song, J.; Billing-Ross, P.; Gao, P.; Shen, X.; Timpanaro, I.

6916,Systemic hypoferraemia and severity of hypoxaemic respiratory failure in COVID-19,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality is associated with hypoxaemia, multiorgan failure, and thromboinflammation. However severity of disease varies considerably and understanding physiological changes that may link to poor outcomes is important. Although increased serum ferritin has been observed in COVID-19 patients consistent with inflammation, other iron parameters have not been examined to our knowledge. Because iron is required for immunity and oxygen utilisation, and dysregulated iron homeostasis has been observed in COPD, we investigated serum iron concentrations in 30 patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU admission. All patients had low serum iron but patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure had more profound hypoferraemia. The area under the curve for receiver operating characteristic curves for serum iron to identify severe hypoxemia was 0{middle dot}95; the optimal Youden Index for distinguishing between severe and non-severe hypoxemia was a serum iron concentration of 2{middle dot}9 mol/L. By linear regression, serum iron was associated with lymphocyte count and PaO2/FiO2. In conclusion, profound hypoferraemia identifies COVID-19 patients with severe hypoxaemia. Serum iron is a simple biomarker that could be usefully employed to stratify patients and monitor disease. Severe hypoferraemia may plausibly impair critical iron-dependent processes such as lymphocyte responses and hypoxia sensing, contributing to pathology, and is potentially treatable.","Shah, A.; Frost, J.; Aaron, L.; Donovan, K.; Mckechnie, S.; Stanworth, S.; Drakesmith, H.",2020-05-13,Intensive Care And Critical Care Medicine,10.1101/2020.05.11.20092114,1,Akshay Shah,University of Oxford,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.20092114v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.20092114v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1186/s13054-020-03051-w
14501,App-based symptom tracking to optimize SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy using machine learning,"BackgroundTests are scarce resources, especially in low and middle-income countries, and the optimization of testing programs during a pandemic is critical for the effectiveness of the disease control. Hence, we aim to use the combination of symptoms to build a regression model as a screening tool to identify people and areas with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to be prioritized for testing.

Materials and MethodsWe applied machine learning techniques and provided a visualization of potential regions with high densities of COVID-19 as a risk map. We performed a retrospective analysis of individuals registered in """"Dados do Bem"""", an app-based symptom tracker in use in Brazil.

ResultsFrom April 28 to July 16, 2020, 337,435 individuals registered their symptoms through the app. Of these, 49,721 participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, being 5,888 (11.8%) positive. Among self-reported symptoms, loss of smell (OR[95%CI]: 4.6 [4.4 - 4.9]), fever (2.6 [2.5 - 2.8]), and shortness of breath (2.1 [1.6-2.7]) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our final model obtained a competitive performance, with only 7% of false-negative users among the predicted as negatives (NPV = 0.93). From the 287,714 users still not tested, our model estimated that only 34.5% are potentially infected, thus reducing the need for extensive testing of all registered users. The model was incorporated by the """"Dados do Bem"""" app aiming to prioritize users for testing. We developed an external validation in the state of Goias and found that of the 465 users selected, 52% tested positive.

7022,Virtual health care for community management of patients with COVID-19.,"ObjectivesTo describe the implementation and early experience of virtual health care for community management of patients with COVID-19.

Designobservational cohort study.

Settinglarge Australian metropolitan health service with established virtual health care program and remote patient monitoring capability.

Participantspatients with COVID-19 living within the health service who can self-isolate safely, do not require immediate admission to an inpatient setting, have no major active comorbid illness and can be managed at home or other suitable accommodation.

Main outcome measurescare escalation rates, including hospital admission.

Resultsbetween 11-29 March 2020, 162/173 (93.6%) locally diagnosed patients with COVID-19 were accepted to the virtual health care program, median age 38y (range 11-79). For the 62 patients discharged during this period the median length of stay was 8 days (range 1-17). The peak of 100 prevalent patients equated to approximately 25 patients per Registered Nurse per shift. Patients were contacted a median of 16 times (range 1-30) during this period, with video consultations used 66.3% of the time; 132/162 (81.5%) patients were monitored remotely. Care escalation rates were low: ambulance attendance, 5 (3%); ED attendance, 4 (2.5%); hospital admission, 3 (1.9%). There were no deaths. Conclusions: community-based virtual health care is feasible for managing most patients with COVID-19 and can be rapidly implemented in an urban Australian context for pandemic management. Health services implementing virtual health care should anticipate challenges with rapid technology deployments and provide adequate support to resolve them including strategies supporting consumer use of health information technologies.","Hutchings, O.; Dearing, C.; Jagers, D.; Shaw, M.; Raffan, F.; Jones, A.; Taggart, R.; Sinclair, T.; Anderson, T.; Ritchie, A.

26181,COVID-19 infection and hospitalization according to the burden of chronic noncommunicable diseases in Brazil,"Chronic diseases, worse socioeconomic conditions and old age can increase infection and hospitalization rate due to Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We assessed the association between the burden of NCDs and the occurrence of infections and hospitalizations of COVID-19 in Brazil in a large COVID-19 national survey data. We analyzed only data collected between July and November 2020 (n = 1,071,782). The frequencies of positive COVID-19 diagnosis and NCD burden were estimated according to age, sex, socioeconomic strata and skin color categories. We estimated hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals using Cox regression models. There is a non-linear dose-response inverse association between per capita income and the rates of infection and hospitalization due to COVID-19. The presence of NCDs was associated with a higher incidence of COVID-19 infection (HR1NCD = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.26; 1.43; HR2 or more NCD= 1.54 95% CI: 1.39; 1.71) and incidence of hospitalization (HR1NCD = 3.08 95% CI: 2.26; 4.19; HR 2or more NCD= 6.81 95% CI: 4.88; 9.49).The difference between the risks of infection or hospitalization of COVID-19 attributable to the burden of NCDs is non-linearly associated with the income.","Ferraz, F.

10092,Affected medical services in Iwate prefecture in the absence of a COVID-19 outbreak,"The Japanese government has declared a national emergency and travel entry ban since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began. As of June 19, 2020, there have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Iwate. Here, we analyzed the excess deaths as well as the number of patients and medical earnings due to the pandemic from prefectural hospitals located in one of the least-affected areas in Japan. From January to March 2020, the excess death rates per month were not significantly higher than the past-year average. Compared to January 2020, the numbers of both outpatients and inpatients in April 2020 showed a 5.2% and 6.1% decrease, respectively. Accordingly, the amount of medical earnings of both outpatients and inpatients in April 2020 showed a 3.0% and 6.3% decrease, respectively. Present analysis demonstrated that there were no excess deaths due to """"unidentified"""" COVID-19 infections in Iwate; however, hospital budgetary management has been affected by the social restrictions. Regardless of COVID-19 infection spread, it may be difficult to maintain daily medical services if such low service activity continues in the existing hospitals. Additional longitudinal studies will be necessary to evaluate the effects of social restrictions on hospital management, but the true demand of regional medical services may emerge after this outbreak.","Sasaki, N.; Nishizuka, S.

18938,The association of smoking status with hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous: A case-control study at a single UK National Health Service trust,"BackgroundIt is unclear whether smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation. We examined i) the association of smoking status with hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with hospitalisation for other respiratory viral infections a year previous; and ii) concordance between smoking status recorded on the electronic health record (EHR) and the contemporaneous medical notes.

MethodsThis case-control study enrolled adult patients (446 cases and 211 controls) at a single National Health Service trust in London, UK. The outcome variable was type of hospitalisation (COVID-19 vs. another respiratory virus a year previous). The exposure variable was smoking status (never/former/current smoker). Logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic position and comorbidities were performed. The study protocol and analyses were pre-registered in April 2020 on the Open Science Framework.

ResultsCurrent smokers had lower odds of being hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous (ORadj=0.55, 95% CI=0.31-0.96, p=.04). There was no significant association among former smokers (ORadj=1.08, 95% CI=0.72-1.65, p=.70). Smoking status recorded on the EHR (compared with the contemporaneous medical notes) was incorrectly recorded for 168 (79.6%) controls ({chi}2(3)=256.5, p=<0.001) and 60 cases (13.5%) ({chi}2(3)=34.2, p=<0.001).

ConclusionsIn a single UK hospital trust, current smokers had reduced odds of being hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous, although it is unclear whether this association is causal. Targeted post-discharge recording of smoking status may account for the greater EHR- medical notes concordance observed in cases compared with controls.","Simons, D.; Perski, O.; Shahab, L.; Brown, J.; Bailey, R.",2021-03-20,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.11.26.20238469,2,Olga Perski,University College London,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.26.20238469v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.26.20238469v2.full.pdf,cc_by,"NA"
22632,Are fast test results preferable to high test sensitivity in contact-tracing strategies?,"Across the world, countries are fighting to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The backbone of the response is a test-trace-isolate strategy, where suspected infected get tested and isolated and possible secondary cases get traced, tested and isolated. Because more accurate tests often take longer to analyze, and the benefits of contact tracing are strengthened by rapid diagnosis, there exists a trade-off in test sensitivity and test waiting time in test-trace-isolate strategies. Here we ask: How many false negatives can be tolerated in a rapid test so that it reduces transmission better than a slower, more accurate test? How does this change with contact tracing efficiency and test waiting time? We find that a rapid, less sensitive test performs best for many test-parameter choices and that this is true even for modest contact tracing efficiency. For COVID-19-like viral parameters, a test with 40% false negatives and immediate result might reduce transmission as well as a test with no false negatives and a 3-day waiting time. Our analysis suggests employing rapid tests to reduce test waiting times as a viable strategy to reduce transmission when testing infrastructure is under stress.","Juul, J.

10048,Hydroxychloroquine and mortality risk of patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of human comparative studies,"BackgroundGlobal COVID-19 deaths reached at least 400,000 fatalities. Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that elicit immunomodulatory effects and had shown in vitro antiviral effects against SRAS-CoV-2. This drug divided opinion worldwide in the medical community but also in the press, the general public and in public health policies. The aim of this systematic review and this meta-analysis was to bring a new overview on this controversial drug and to assess whether hydroxychloroquine could reduce COVID-19 mortality risk in hospitalized patients.

Methods and FindingsPubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, MedRxiv and grey literature were searched until 10 June 2020. Only studies of COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine (with or without azithromycin) compared with a comparative standard care group and with full-text articles in English were included. Studies reporting effect sizes as Odds Ratios, Hazard Ratio and Relative Risk for mortality risk and the number of deaths per groups were included. This meta-analysis was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and registered on PROSPERO (Registration number: CRD42020190801). Independent extraction has been performed by two independent reviewers. Effect sizes were pooled using a random-effects model.

The initial search leaded to 112 articles, from which 16 articles met our inclusion criteria. 15 studies were retained for association between hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19 survival including 15,081 patients (8,072 patients in the hydroxychloroquine arm and 7,009 patients in the standard care arm with respectively, 1,578 deaths and 1,423 deaths). 6 studies were retained for hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. Hydroxychloroquine was not significantly associated with mortality risk (pooled Relative Risk RR=0.82 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.62-1.07, I2=82, Pheterogeneity<0.01, n=15)) within hospitalized patients, nor in association with azithromycin (pooled Relative Risk RR=1.33 (95% CI: 0.92-1.92, I2=75%, Pheterogeneity<0.01, n=6)), nor in the numerous subgroup analysis by study design, median age population, published studies (vs unpublished articles), level of bias risk. However, stratified analysis by continents, we found a significant decreased risk of mortality associated with hydroxychlroquine alone but not with azithromycin among European (RR= 0.62 (95%CI: 0.41-0.93, n=7)) and Asian studies (RR=0.36 (95%CI:0.18-0.73, n=1)), with heterogeneity detected across continent (Pheterogeneity between=0.003). These finding should be interpreted with caution since several included studies had a low quality of evidence with a small sample size, a lack of adjustment on potential confounders or selection and intervention biases.

ConclusionOur meta-analysis does not support the use of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin to reduce COVID-19 mortality in hospitalized patients. It raises the question of the hydroxychloroquine use outside of clinical trial. Additional results from larger randomised controlled trials are needed","Thibault, F.; Guihur, A.; Rebeaud, M.; Mulot, M.; Mahamat-Saleh, Y.",2020-06-19,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.17.20133884,1,Fiolet Thibault,"Paris-Saclay University, INSERM U1018 (CESP)",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.17.20133884v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.17.20133884v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.cmi.2020.08.022
7764,"Trends of SARS-CoV-2 infection worldwide: Role of population density, age structure, and climate on transmission and case fatality","IntroductionThe highly heterogenous disease transmission pattern of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic maybe driven by complex factors, which may include habitat suitability, region specific human mobility, and transmission related to susceptibility. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of different spatial and demographic factors on COVID-19 transmission and case fatality worldwide.

MethodsWe assessed SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission and COVID-19 related fatalities in 50 countries in all continents of the globe. Data from the COVID-19 data repository of the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering, the European center for disease control and prevention, and the World Health Organization were used to obtain the daily number of cases and organize incidence data. Disease spread was assessed using the reproduction number of the disease across the sampled countries. R statistical softwares R0 package was used to estimate the reproduction number of the COVID19 using the exponential growth method. After computing the reproductive number of each country in the study, a multiple linear regression model was fitted using R0 value as dependent variable, and latitude and population density as an independent variable. Disease severity was analyzed using the case fatality ratio of COVID-19. The proportion of deaths were meta-analyzed using the R statistical softwares metaphor package, using random effect inverse variance weighting to come up with the case fatality ratio.

ResultsWe found no statistically significant association between disease spread and latitude or population density. The regression model analysis that accounted for age, population density and latitude showed that age distribution remains an important driver shaping the current distribution of COVID-19 cases. The relative frequency of people above 65 years old was positively correlated with the cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases as well as case fatality ratio in each country. The multiple linear regression model fitted between CFR and the three major covariates showed that, the demographic distribution of the sampled countries is strongly associated with the case fatality ratio. Correlation with proportion of populations over 65 years old is concordant with the previous findings relationship between case fatality ratio and patient age.

ConclusionThis analysis provides important information that can inform the decisions of local and global health authorities. Particularly, as our study confirms that death and severity of COVID19 are associated with age, in countries with the biggest outbreaks, strategies must be employed to ensure that high-risk groups, such as old people received adequate protection from COVID-19.","Endailalu, T.

13634,COVID-19 TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS IN INDIA WITH EXTENDED SEIR MODEL,"India is one of the most harshly affected countries due to COVID epidemic. Early implementation of lockdown protocols were useful to control certain parameters of transmission dynamics, but the numbers are consistently increasing in later months. Indias population is divided into different clusters on the basis of population density and population mobility, even varying resource availability and since the recent cases are coming from throughout the country, it allows us to model an overall average of the country. In this study, we try to prove the efficiency of using the SEIR epidemiological model for different rate study analysis for COVID epidemic in India. Along with it we derived newer components for better forecast of the pandemic in India. We found that there is a decrease in R0 value, but still the epidemic is not under control. The percentage of infected patients being admitted into ICU for critical care is around 9.986%, while the chances of recovery of critical patients being admitted to the ICU seem to be slim at 79.9% of the admitted being dead.","Mali Reddy, B.

22977,Control of COVID-19 transmission on an urban university campus during a second wave of the pandemic,"ImportanceThe COVID-19 pandemic had a wide-ranging impact on educational institutions across the United States. Given potential financial challenges and adverse psychosocial effects of campus closure, as done in the spring of 2020 in response to the first wave, many institutions of higher education developed strategies to allow campuses to reopen and operate in the fall despite the ongoing threat of COVID-19. Many however opted to have limited campus re-opening in order to minimize potential risk of spread of SARS-CoV-2.

ObjectiveTo analyze how Boston University (BU) fully reopened its campus in the fall of 2020 and controlled COVID-19 transmission despite worsening transmission in the city of Boston.

DesignMulti-faceted intervention case study.

SettingLarge urban university campus.

InterventionsThe BU response included a high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing facility with capacity to delivery results in less than 24 hours; routine asymptomatic screening for COVID-19; daily health attestations; compliance monitoring and feedback; robust contact tracing, quarantine and isolation in on campus facilities; face mask use; enhanced hand hygiene; social distancing recommendations; de-densification of classrooms and public places; and enhancement of all building air systems.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresBetween August and December 2020, BU conducted >500,000 COVID-19 tests and identified 719 individuals with COVID-19: 627 (87.2%) students, 11 (1.5%) faculty, and 212 (25.5%) staff. Overall, about 1.8% of the BU community tested positive. Infections among faculty and staff were mostly acquired off campus, while undergraduate infections were more likely acquired in non-classroom campus settings. Of 837 close contacts traced, 86 (10.3%) tested positive for COVID-19. BU contact tracers identified a source of transmission for 51.5% of cases with 55.7% identifying a source outside of BU. Among infected faculty and staff with a known source of infection, the majority reported a transmission source outside of BU (100% for faculty and 79.8% for staff).

Conclusions and RelevanceBU was successful in containing COVID-19 transmission on campus while minimizing off campus acquisition of COVID-19 from the greater Boston area. A coordinated strategy of testing, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine, with robust management and oversight, can control COVID-19 transmission, even in an urban university setting.","Hamer, D.

7332,SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence trends in healthy blood donors during the COVID-19 Milan outbreak,"ObjectivesThe Milan metropolitan area in Northern Italy was among the most severely hit by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The epidemiological trends of mild COVID-19 are however still unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthy asymptomatic adults, the risk factors, and laboratory correlates.

DesignWe conducted a cross-sectional study during the outbreak. Presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies against the Nucleocapsid protein was assessed by a lateral flow immunoassay.

SettingBlood center at a leading academic hospital serving as COVID-19 referral center.

ParticipantsWe considered a random sample of blood donors since the start of the outbreak (February 24th to April 8th 2020, n=789).

Main outcome measuresThe main outcome was the prevalence of IgG/IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

ResultsThe test had a 98.3% specificity and 100% sensitivity, and for IgG+ was validated in a subset by an independent ELISA against the Spike protein (N=34, P<0.001). At the start of the outbreak, the overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 4.6% (2.3 to 7.9; P<0.0001 vs. 120 historical controls). During the study period characterized by a gradual implementation of social distancing measures, there was a progressive increase in seroprevalence to 7.1% (4.4 to 10.8), due to a rise in IgG+ to 5% (2.8 to 8.2; P=0.004 for trend, adjusted weekly increase 2.7{+/-}1.3%), but not of IgM+ (P=NS). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, seroconversion to IgG+ was more frequent in younger (P=0.043), while recent infections (IgM+) in older individuals (P=0.002). IgM+ was independently associated with higher triglycerides, eosinophils, and lymphocytes (P<0.05).

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 infection was already circulating in Milan at the outbreak start. Social distancing may have been more effective in younger individuals, and by the end of April 4.4-10.8% of healthy adults had evidence of seroconversion. Asymptomatic infection may affect lipid profile and blood count.

21797,Early Multidrug Outpatient Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (COVID-19) and Reduced Mortality Among Nursing Home Residents,"The outbreak of COVID-19 from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world with tremendous morbidity and mortality in the elderly. In-hospital treatment addresses the multifaceted nature of the illness including viral replication, cytokine storm, and endothelial injury with thrombosis. We identified nine reports of early treatment outcomes in COVID-19 nursing home patients. Multi-drug therapy including hydroxychloroquine with one or more anti-infectives, corticosteroids, and antithrombotic agents can be extended to seniors in the nursing home setting without hospitalization. Data from nine studies found multidrug regimens relying on the use of hydroxychloroquine as well as other agents including doxycycline were associated with a statistically significant and >60% reductions in mortality. Going forward, we theorize and based on the evidence, that early empiric treatment for the elderly with COVID-19 in the nursing home setting (or similar congregated settings with elderly residents/patients) has a genuine probability of success and acceptable safety. This group remains our highest at-risk group and warrants acute treatment focus that will prevent the development and/or worsening of problems associated with COVID-19, most particularly isolation, hospitalization, and death. In fact, with the rapidity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in nursing homes, in-center treatment of patients with acute COVID-19 is possibly the most rational and importantly feasible strategy to reduce the risks of hospitalization and death. If the approach remains  wait-and-see and elderly high-risk patients in such congregated nursing room type settings are allowed to worsen with no early treatment, they may be too sick and fragile to benefit from in-hospital therapeutics and are at risk for pulmonary failure, life-ending micro-thrombi of the lungs, kidneys etc. We put forth the notion that the most important factor in this regard, is making available early therapeutic intervention as described here. These drugs include and under supervision by skilled doctors, combination/sequenced ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, colchicine, azithromycin, doxycycline, bromhexine hydrochloride, and favipiravir (outside the US), along with inhaled steroids such as budesonide and oral steroids including dexamethasone and prednisone, and anti-thrombotic anti-clotting drugs such as heparin). As the clinical trials data on treatments for COVID-19 mature, this early treatment therapeutic option deserves serious, urgent, and sober consideration by the medical establishment and respective decision-makers.","Alexander, P.

8133,Hypertension and renin-angiotensin system blockers are not associated with expression of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the kidney,"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular entry point for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) - the cause of COVID-19 disease. It has been hypothesized that use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibiting medications in patients with hypertension, increases the expression of ACE2 and thereby increases the risk of COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes or death. However, the effect of RAS-inhibition on ACE2 expression in human tissues of key relevance to blood pressure regulation and COVID-19 infection has not previously been reported.

We examined how hypertension, its major metabolic co-phenotypes and antihypertensive medications relate to ACE2 renal expression using information from up to 436 patients whose kidney transcriptomes were characterised by RNA-sequencing. We further validated some of the key observations in other human tissues and/or a controlled experimental model. Our data reveal increasing expression of ACE2 with age in both human lungs and the kidney. We show no association between renal expression of ACE2 and either hypertension or common types of RAS inhibiting drugs. We demonstrate that renal abundance of ACE2 is positively associated with a biochemical index of kidney function and show a strong enrichment for genes responsible for kidney health and disease in ACE2 co-expression analysis.

Collectively, our data indicate that neither hypertension nor antihypertensive treatment are likely to alter individual risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or influence clinical outcomes in COVID-19 through changes of ACE2 expression. Our data further suggest that in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, kidney ACE2 is most likely nephro-protective but the age-related increase in its expression within lungs and kidneys may be relevant to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Jiang, X.; Eales, J.

2148,"Clinical characteristics of 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","BackgroundAlthough the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused over 2200 deaths in China, there was no study about death yet. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of non-survivors with COVID-19.

MethodsFor this retrospective, single-center study, we included 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR between Jan 21 and Feb 10, 2020 according to the recommended protocol. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 14, 2020. This study was approved by the ethics commissions of the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan, with a waiver of informed consent due to a public health outbreak investigation.

FindingsWe included 36 patients who died from COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 69.22 years (SD 9.64, range 50-90). 25(69.44%) patients were males, and 11 (30.56%) female. 26 (72.22%) patients had chronic diseases, mainly including hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Patients had common clinical symptoms of fever (34 [94.44%] patients), cough (28 [77.78%] patients), shortness of breath (21 [58.33%] patients), and fatigue (17 [47.22%] patient). Chest computed tomographic scans showed that 31 (96.88%) patients had bilateral pneumonia. Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.67{square}x{square}109/L [SD, 0.33]) occurred in 24 patients (70.59%), decreased albumin (30.18, [SD, 4.76]) in 25 patients (80.65%), elevated D-dimer (8.64 [IQR, 2.39-20]) in 27 patients (100%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (502.5 U/L [IQR, 410-629]) in 26 patients (100%). Nearly all of the patients have elevated CRP (106.3 mg/L [IQR, 60.83-225.3]), PCT (0.61 ng/ml [IQR, 0.16-2.10]) and IL-6 (100.6 pg/ml [IQR, 51.51-919.5]). Most patients received antiviral therapy and antibiotic therapy, and more than half of patients received glucocorticoid therapy (25 [69.44%]). All the patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. One (2.78%) patient presented with acute renal injury. The median time from onset to death was 17 days.

InterpretationLots of patients died from COVID-19 till now. The median survival time of these non-survivors from onset to death was about 2 weeks. Most patients were older males with comorbidities. They finally progressed to ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. Gradually decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation biomarkers were common, and need to be monitored in the routine treatment.

FundingThere is no any funder involved in this study.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSARS-CoV-2 has been spreading in China as well as in other countries. We searched PubMed for articles published up to Feb 15, 2020. Serveral articles that describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of general COVID-19 patients. However, special reports about dead cases of COVID-19 were limited but warranted, considering the large amount of confirmed cases, which is still increasing

Added value of this studyWe retrospectively analysed specific clinical information of 36 non-survivors infected with SARS-CoV-2 in this single-centered study. Most patients were older males with comorbidities. Gradually decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation biomarkers were found in these patients. They finally progressed to ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. The mean survival time in our cohort of COVID-19 non-survivors was about 2 weeks.

16413,Diagnostic Accuracy of FDA Authorized Serology Tests to Detect SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"ImportanceSerology tests are diagnostic and complementary to molecular tests during the COVID-19 pandemic.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of FDA authorized serology tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Data sourcesA search of MEDLINE, SCOPUS, CINAHL Plus, and EMBASE up to April 4, 2020, was performed to identify studies using the """"COVID 19 testing"""" and """"meta-analysis."""" FDA website was accessed for the list of tests for emergency use authorization (EUA).

Study SelectionManufacturer reported serology tests published in the FDA website were selected. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of the selected reports.

Data extraction and synthesisThe meta-analysis was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. A bivariate analysis using the """"random-effects model"""" was applied for pooled summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and the summary receiver operating characteristic curves.

Main outcomes and measuresThe primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of the serology test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subgroup analysis of the diagnostic accuracy with lag time between symptom onset and testing were studied.

ResultsSeven manufacturer listed reports were included. The pooled sensitivity was 87% (95% CI, 78% - 93%), the pooled specificity was 100% (95% CI, 97% - 100%), and the area under the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.97. At [&le;] 7 days, sensitivity was 44% (95% CI, 21% - 70%), and for 8-14 days, sensitivity was 84% (95% CI, 67 % - 94%).For blood draws [&ge;] 15 days after the onset of symptoms, sensitivity was 96% (95% CI, 93% - 98%). Heterogeneity was substantial, and the risk of bias was low in this analysis.

Conclusions and relevanceFDA authorized serology tests demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 infection (certainty of evidence: moderate). There is a wide variation in the test accuracy based on the duration between the onset of symptoms and the tests (certainty of evidence: low).

Key- points

QuestionsWhat is the pooled diagnostic accuracy of FDA authorized serology tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies?

FindingsIn this systematic review and meta-analysis of seven reports from FDA authorized serology tests to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV2 antibodies (3336 patients/ samples) pooled sensitivity was 87%, and pooled specificity was almost 100%. There was a wide variation in test performance based on the duration between the onset of symptoms and the tests.

MeaningFDA authorized tests are highly accurate to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antibodies if tests are performed under a similar condition, as presented in the original report. There is a wide variation in the test performance based on the time interval between the onset of symptoms to the tests.","Pandey, R.; Gourishankar, A.",2020-10-11,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.07.20208553,1,Rajesh Pandey,University of Texas at Houston,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208553v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208553v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
27926,"Evaluation of the effectiveness of remdesivir in treating severe COVID-19 using data from the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK: a prospective, national cohort study.","BackgroundRemdesivir was given UK early-access approval for use in COVID-19 in people aged 12 years and older on 26th May 2020 on the basis of unmet clinical need. Evidence on the side effects, complications of therapy and effectiveness of this therapy is lacking or conflicting.

MethodsAdults with severe COVID-19 treated with remdesivir were compared with propensity-score matched controls, identified from the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol study of UK hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Remdesivir patients were matched to controls according to baseline underlying 14-day mortality risk. The effect of remdesivir on short-term outcomes was investigated (primary outcome: 14-day mortality). Effect sizes were estimated and adjusted for potential confounders using multivariable modelling.

Results1,549 patients given remdesivir and 4,964 matched controls were identified satisfying inclusion and exclusion criteria. The balance diagnostic threshold was achieved. Patients had symptoms for a median of 6 days prior to baseline; 62% were male, with mean (SD) age 63.1 (15.6) years, and 80% categorised as  White ethnicity. Fourteen-day mortality was not statistically significantly associated with treatment (9.3 % remdesivir vs. 11.9% controls, odds-ratio 0.80, [95% CI 0.60-1.07], p=0.116, adjusted for age, sex, number of key comorbidities, dexamethasone use, and diagnosis of viral pneumonia.

FindingsTreatment with remdesivir was not associated with a reduction in mortality in our primary endpoint at 14 days.

InterpretationRemdesivir did not significantly improve mortality in this study. The findings are subject to the limitations of an observational study. Balance was achieved for measured baseline factors, but unmeasured confounders may account for observed treatment effect sizes.

FundingMedical Research Council UK & National Institute of Health Research

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSAt the time of designing this study, two clinical trials measuring the efficacy of remdesivir as a therapeutic in treating SARS COV-2 had published results: ACTT-1 and SOLIDARITY. ACTT-1 suggested that for those who required supplemental oxygen but not ventilation at baseline, remdesivir reduced time-to-recovery (rate ratio 1.45, [95% CI: 1.19-1.79]), improved clinical status at 15 days (proportional odds ratio 1.6 [1.2-2.3]), and improved mortality by both 15 days (hazard ratio 0.28 [0.12-0.66]) and 29 days (0.30 [0.14-0.64]) compared with a placebo. SOLIDARITY did not find any evidence of benefit for remdesivir in these same types of patients - it reported on time-to-recovery, and 28-day mortality, compared with the local standard of care.

Added value of this studyThis study presents real-world data on the effectiveness of remdesivir use during a non-surge phase of the pandemic in the UK, specifically looking at patients for whom the ACTT-1 trial suggested would be most likely to benefit from remdesivir.

Implications of all the available evidenceWe show that during the pandemic, remdesivir was given to a wide demographic of patients in the UK (on average older than those in clinical trials). At 14-days post baseline no reduction in absolute mortality was observed. Propensity score matching achieved balance for measured baseline variables. However as with all observational studies, differences between the groups in unmeasured variables that may influence clinicians but were not recorded in our study, are plausible.","Arch, B.

15451,Rapid transition to distance learning due to COVID-19: Perceptions of postgraduate dental learners and instructors,"The outbreak of COVID-19 necessitated abrupt transition from on campus, face-to- face sessions to online, distance learning in higher education institutions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the perceptions of postgraduate dental learners and instructors about the transition to distance learning, including the changes to the learning and teaching and its efficaciousness.

A mixed-methods approach to research was utilized. All the instructors and postgraduate learners were invited to participate in the online survey. Quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential analyses on SPSS for Windows version 25.0, and for the responses to the open-ended questions, multi-staged Thematic Analysis was utilized.

Both groups of stakeholders: learners and instructors, were quite satisfied with the rapid transition to distance learning due to COVID-19. Instructors were significantly more satisfied than the learners. The stakeholders adapted well to the change. The perception of the stakeholders regarding the case-based scenarios significantly influenced their level of satisfaction. As perceived by the stakeholders, the transition to distance learning entailed advantages and challenges. Going through the experience equipped the stakeholders with lessons learned and enabled them to develop informed opinions of how best to sustain learning and teaching irrespective of how matters unfold in relation to the pandemic.

In conclusion, the worldwide dental education community faced unprecedented challenges due to the onset of COVID-19.

Past research has highlighted the corrosive effects of unemployment on health and health behaviors. This study examines whether the effects of job loss on changes in body mass index (BMI) are moderated by genetic predisposition using data from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS).

19522,"Smoking, distress and COVID-19 in England: cross-sectional population surveys from 2016 to 2020","BackgroundChanges in the prevalence of mental health problems among smokers due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England have important implications for existing health inequalities. This study examined the prevalence of psychological distress among smokers following the onset of the pandemic compared with previous years.

MethodsCross-sectional data were used from a representative survey of smokers (18+) in England (n = 2,927) during four months (April to July) in 2016, 2017 and 2020. Adjusted logistic regressions estimated the associations between past-month psychological distress across two time periods (2016/17 and 2020), and age. Weighted proportions, chi-squared statistics and stratified logistic regression models were used to compare the distributions of minimal, moderate and severe distress, respectively, within socio-demographic and smoking characteristic categories in 2016/17 and 2020.

ResultsThe prevalence of moderate and severe distress among past-year smokers was higher in 2020 (moderate: 28.79%, 95%CI 26.11-31.60; OR=2.08, 95%CI 1.34-3.25; severe: 11.04%, 9.30-13.12; OR=2.16, 1.13-4.07) than in 2016/17 (moderate: 20.66%, 19.02-22.43; severe: 8.23%, 7.16-9.47). While there was no overall evidence of an interaction between time period and age, young (16-24 years) and middle-age groups (45-54 years) may have experienced greater increases in moderate and older age groups (65+ years) in severe distress from 2016/17 to 2020. There were also increases in 2020 of moderate distress among those from more disadvantaged social grades and of both moderate and severe distress among women and those with low cigarette addiction.

ConclusionsBetween April-July 2016/17 and April-July 2020 in England there were increases in both moderate and severe distress among smokers. The distribution of distress differed between 2016/17 and 2020 and represents a widening of established inequalities, with increases in distress among socio-economically disadvantaged groups, women and diverging age groups.

17699,Hospital based contact tracing of COVID-19 patients and health care workers and risk stratification of exposed health care workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Eastern India,"IntroductionContact tracing and subsequent quarantining of Health Care Workers (HCWs) is essential to minimize further transmission of COVID-19 infection. In this study, we have reported the yield of Contact Tracing of COVID-19 Patients and HCWs and risk stratification of exposed HCWs.

MethodologyThis is a secondary analysis of routine data collected for contact tracing from 19th March to 31st August 2020 at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India. HCWs exposed to COVID-19 infections were categorized as per the risk stratification guidelines and the high-risk contacts were quarantined for 14 days and tested on 7th day from last day of exposure. The low risk contacts were encouraged to closely monitor their symptoms while continuing to work.

ResultsOut of 3411 HCWs exposed to COVID 19 patients (n=269) and HCWs (n=91), 890 (26.1%) were high risk contacts and 2521 (73.9%) were low risk contacts. The test positivity rate of high-risk contact was 3.82% and for low risk contact was 1.90%. Average number of high-risk contacts was significantly higher; for admitted patients (6.6) as compared to HCWs (4.0) and outpatients (0.2), p value = 0.009; for patients admitted in non-COVID areas (15.8) as compared to COVID areas (0.27), p value < 0.001; and when clustering of cases was present (14.3) as compared to isolated cases (8.2); p value < 0.001. Trend analysis (15 days block period) showed a significant decline in number of mean numbers of high-risk contacts during the study period.

ConclusionContact tracing and risk stratification was effective and helped in reducing the number of HCWs going for quarantine. There was also a decline in high-risk contacts during study period suggesting role of implementation of hospital based COVID related infection control strategies. This contact tracing and risk stratification approach designed in the current study can also be implemented in other healthcare settings.","Sahoo, D. P.; Singh, A. K.; Sahu, D. P.; Pradhan, S.

1972,A Peptide-based Magnetic Chemiluminescence Enzyme Immunoassay for Serological Diagnosis of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),"A respiratory illness has been spreading rapidly in China, since its outbreak in Wuhan city, Hubei province in December 2019. The illness was caused by a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical manifestations related to SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from no symptom to fatal pneumonia. World Health Organization (WHO) named the diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection as COVID-19. Real time RT-PCR is the only laboratory test available till now to confirm the infection. However, the accuracy of real time RT-PCR depends on many factors, including sampling location and of methods, quality of RNA extraction and training of operators etc.. Variations in these factors might significantly lower the sensitivity of the detection. We developed a peptide-based luminescent immunoassay to detect IgG and IgM. Cut-off value of this assay was determined by the detection of 200 healthy sera and 167 sera from patients infected with other pathogens than SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the performance of this assay, we detected IgG and IgM in the 276 sera from confirmed patients. The positive rate of IgG and IgM were 71.4% (197/276) and 57.2% (158/276) respectively. By combining with real time RT-PCR detection, this assay might help to enhance the accuracy of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Cai, X.; Chen, J.; Hu, J.; Long, Q.; Deng, H.; Fan, K.; Liao, P.; Liu, B.; Wu, G.; Chen, Y.; Li, Z.; Wang, K.; Zhang, X.; Tian, W.; Xiang, J.; Du, H.; Wang, J.; Hu, Y.; Tang, N.; Lin, Y.; Ren, J.; Huang, L.; Wei, J.; Gan, C.; Chen, Y.; Gao, Q.; Chen, A.; He, C.; Wang, D.; Hu, P.; Zhou, F.; Huang, A.; Liu, P.; Wang, D.",2020-02-25,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.02.22.20026617,1,Deqiang Wang,Chongqing Medical University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026617v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026617v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1093/infdis/jiaa243
11116,Treatment Response to Hydroxychloroquine and Antibiotics for mild to moderate COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study from South Korea,"ObjectivesTo assess the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine on mild-moderate COVID-19 patients in South Korea.

MethodsA retrospective cohort study of the 358 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) patients was conducted. 226 patients met inclusion criteria for analysis. Propensity score matching (PSM) and Cox regression method were utilized to control and adjust for confounding factors. Mild to moderate COVID-19 patients were managed with hydroxychloroquine (HQ) plus antibiotics (n = 31) or conservative treatment (n = 195).

ResultsKaplan-Meier curves drawn using propensity score-matched data revealed no differences between the length of time to viral clearance and duration of hospital stay between the two treatment arms (p=0.18, p=0.088). Multivariable Cox regression analysis similarly showed that time to viral clearance(Hazard ratio (HR) 0.97, [95%-confidence interval (CI): 0.57-1.67]) and symptom duration(HR 1.05, [95%-CI: 0.62-1.78]) were not different between groups. No severe adverse event or death was observed in either group.

ConclusionsHQ with antibiotics was not associated with better clinical outcomes in terms of time to viral clearance, length of hospital stay, and duration of symptoms compared to conservative treatment alone. Large prospective randomized trials are necessary for definitive conclusions.","An, M. H.; Kim, M. S.; Park, Y.; Kim, B.-O.; Kang, S. H.; Kimn, W. J.; Park, S.

We have succeeded in formulating a new indicator based on daily number of infected people from publicly available data, which enables us to do the both. We show the validity of the indicator by demonstrating that a universal analysis of current status of COVID-19 spreading over countries can predict effects of measures such as the blockage of cities and social distancing, signs of new spread, and possible regional dependence in the formation of herd immunity.","Nakano, T.; Ikeda, Y.",2020-05-05,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.25.20080200,2,Takashi Nakano,Osaka University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20080200v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20080200v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.2196/20144

In response, governments have implemented measures to slow transmission through """"social distancing."""" However, the practice of social distancing may depend on prevailing socioeconomic conditions and beliefs. Using 15-17 million anonymized cell phone records, we find that lower per capita income and greater Republican orientation were associated with significantly reduced social distancing among U.S. counties. These associations persisted after adjusting for county-level sociodemographic and labor market characteristics as well as state fixed effects. These results may help policymakers and health professionals identify communities that are most vulnerable to transmission and direct resources and communications accordingly.","Kavanagh, N.

9513,Remarks on pooling Coronavirus tests,"Diagnostic testing for the novel Coronavirus is an important tool to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. However, testing capacities are limited. A modified testing protocol, whereby a number of probes are """"pooled"""" (that is, grouped), is known to increase the capacity for testing. Here, we model pooled testing with a double-average model, which we think to be close to reality for Covid-19 testing. The optimal pool size and the effect of test errors are considered. Results show that the best pool size is three to five, under reasonable assumptions. Pool testing even reduces the number of false positives in the absence of dilution effects.","Pikovski, A.; Bentele, K.",2020-06-12,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.08.20125781,1,Alexander Pikovski,self-employed,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.08.20125781v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.08.20125781v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1017/S0950268820001752
21345,Agent-Based Simulation of Covid-19 Vaccination Policies in CovidSIMVL,"An agent-based infectious disease modeling tool (CovidSIMVL) is employed in this paper to explore outcomes associated with MRNA two-dose vaccination regimens set out in Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) documents submitted by Pfizer and Moderna to the US Department of Health & Human Services. As well, the paper explores outcomes associated with a third """"Hybrid"""" policy that reflects ranges of expected levels of protection according to Pfizer and Moderna EUAs, but entails a 35 day separation between first and second dose, which exceeds the 21 days set out in Pfizer documentation or the 28 days in Moderna documentation.

Four CovidSIMVL parameters are varied in the course of 75 simulated clinical trials. Two relate directly to the vaccines and their impacts (duration between doses; degree of expected protection conferred by different vaccines following first or second dose). Two relate to the simulation contexts to which the vaccines are applied (degree of infectivity; duration of infectivity). The simulated trials demonstrate expected effects for timing of second dose, and for degree of protection associated with first and second dose of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, and the effects are consistent with an assumed value of 75% for degree of protection after first and second doses for the Hybrid vaccine. However, the simulated trials suggest a more complex interaction between expected level of protection following first dose, timing of second dose and degree of infectivity. These results suggest that policy options should not be considered independent of the transmission dynamics that are manifested in the contexts in which the policies could be applied.

CovidSIMVL embodies stochasticity in the mechanisms that govern viral transmission, and it treats the basic reproduction number (R0)as an emergent characteristic of transmission dynamics, not as a pre-set value that determines those dynamics. As such, results reported in this paper reflect outcomes that could happen, but do not necessarily reflect what is more or less likely to happen, given different configurations of parameters. The discussion section goes into some measure of detail regarding next steps that could be pursued to enhance the potential for agent-based models such as CovidSIMVL to inform exploration of possible vaccination policies, and to project outcomes that are possible or likely in local contexts, where stochasticity and heterogeneity of transmission must be featured in models that are intended to reflect local realism.","Chang, E.; Moselle, K.

17886,"Changes in physical activity, sitting and sleep across the COVID-19 national lockdown period in Scotland.","We examine the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and concomitant restrictions (i.e. lockdown) on 24-hour movement behaviors (i.e. physical activity, sitting, sleep) in a purposive sample of people (n=3230) reporting change recruited on-line. Participants self-reported time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), walking, sitting and sleep prior to lockdown (T1), during the first national lockdown (T2) and as restrictions initially started to ease (T3). For each 24-hour movement behavior, category-shifts are reported (positive, negative or did not change), as well as the percentage of participants recording positive/negative changes across clusters of behaviors and the percentage of participants recording improvement or maintenance of change across time. From T1 to T2 walking decreased, whereas MVPA, sitting and sleep increased, from T2 to T3 levels returned to pre-lockdown for all but MVPA. Participants who changed one behavior positively were more likely to report a positive change in another and 50% of those who reported positive changes from T1 to T2 maintained or improved further when restrictions started to ease. The current study showed that a large proportion of the sample reported positive changes, most notably those displaying initially poor levels of each behavior. These findings will inform salutogenic intervention development.","Janssen, X.; Fleming, L.; Kirk, A.; Rollins, L.; Young, D.; Grealy, M.; Macdonald, B.; Flowers, P.; Williams, L.",2020-11-06,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.11.05.20226381,1,Xanne Janssen,University of Strathclyde,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.05.20226381v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.05.20226381v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3390/ijerph17249362
25648,Prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome in the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2018,"ImportanceMetabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of risk factors presaging the development of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. It is a risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

ObjectiveTo estimate the prevalence of MetS in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2018.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis cohort study included 22370 eligible participants aged [&ge;]20 years from the NHANES 2011-2018.

Main Outcome and MeasureMetS was defined as the presence of at least three of these components: central obesity, reduced high-density lipoprotein, elevated triglycerides, elevated blood pressure and elevated fasting blood glucose. The prevalence of MetS was estimated taking into account the complex sampling. The time trend was evaluated using logistic regression. Annual percentage changes (APC) were used to measure the trends in MetS prevalence.

ResultsThe prevalence of MetS was 36.2% (95% CI, 32.3-40.3), 34.8% (95% CI, 32.3-37.4), 39.9% (95% CI, 36.6-43.2) and 38.3% (95% CI, 35.3-41.3) in 2011-2, 2013-4, 2015-6, 2017-8, respectively (P for trend =.08). Among the MetS components, the prevalence of elevated glucose increased from 48.7% (95% CI, 45.9-51.5) in 2011-2 to 64.3% (95% CI, 61.0-67.4) in 2017-8 [P for trend <.001; APC=11.7, (95% CI, 3.5-21.0)].

19623,SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 hospitalised patients in Switzerland: a prospective cohort profile,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, which emerged in China in late 2019, rapidly spread across the world causing several million victims in 213 countries. Switzerland was severely hit by the virus, with 43000 confirmed cases as of September 1st, 2020.

AimIn cooperation with the Federal Office of Public Health, we set up a surveillance database in February 2020 to monitor hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in addition to their mandatory reporting system.

MethodsPatients hospitalised for more than 24 hours with a positive PCR test, from 20 Swiss hospitals, are included. Data collection follows a custom Case Report Form based on WHO recommendations and adapted to local needs. Nosocomial infections were defined as infections for which the onset of symptoms started more than 5 days after the patients admission date.

ResultsAs of September 1st, 2020, 3645 patients were included. Most patients were male (2168 - 59.5%),and aged between 50 and 89 years (2778 - 76.2%), with a median age of 68 (IQR 54-79). Community infections dominated with 3249 (89.0%) reports. Comorbidities were frequently reported: hypertension (1481 - 61.7%), cardiovascular diseases (948 - 39.5%), and diabetes (660 - 27.5%) being the most frequent in adults; respiratory diseases and asthma (4 -21.1%), haematological and oncological diseases (3 - 15.8%) being the most frequent in children. Complications occurred in 2679 (73.4%) episodes, mostly for respiratory diseases (2470 - 93.2% in adults, 16 - 55.2% in children), renal (681 - 25.7%) and cardiac (631 - 23.8%) complication for adults. The second and third most frequent complications in children affected the digestive system and the liver (7 - 24.1%). A targeted treatment was given in 1299 (35.6%) episodes, mostly with hydroxychloroquine (989 - 76.1%). Intensive care units stays were reported in 578 (15.8%) episodes. 527 (14.5%) deaths were registered, all among adults.

ConclusionThe surveillance system has been successfully initiated and provides a very representative set of data for Switzerland.

27065,Possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection in metastatic microenvironment of cancer,"According to a report from the World Health Organization, the mortality and severity rates among patients with cancer infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are significantly higher than those of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 without complications. Common and cancer-specific risk factors may be involved in the mortality and severity rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Various factors have been determined to contribute to the aggravation of COVID-19 in patients with cancer. However, on the basis of current research, the factors involved in the aggravation of COVID-19 in patients with cancer have not been fully investigated. In the general course of treatment for patients with cancer, the detection of the formation of metastases in other organs is common. Therefore, the present study investigates the association between lung metastatic lesion formation and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. On the basis of the results obtained, in the pulmonary micrometastatic niche of patients with ovarian cancer, alveolar epithelial stem-like cells adjacent to the ovarian cancer were observed. Moreover, it was revealed that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a host-side receptor for SARS-CoV-2, was expressed in alveolar epithelial stem-like cells adjacent to the ovarian cancer in the pulmonary micrometastatic niche. Furthermore, it was also observed that the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain binds to alveolar epithelial stem-like cells. In other words, it was suggested that patients with cancer and pulmonary micrometastases may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. The prevention of de novo niche formation in metastatic disease may be a new strategy for the clinical treatment of COVID-19 for patients with cancer.","Hayashi, T.; Konishi, I.",2021-05-26,Oncology,10.1101/2021.05.24.21257662,1,Takuma Hayashi,National Hospital Organization Kyoto Medical Center,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.24.21257662v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.24.21257662v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
5081,"SARS-CoV-2 serological analysis of COVID-19 hospitalized patients, pauci-symptomatic individuals and blood donors.","It is of paramount importance to evaluate the prevalence of both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and their antibody response profile.

Two in-house ELISA assays, that recognize the full-length nucleoprotein (N) or trimeric Spike (S) ectodomain were implemented. We also developed two novel assays: the S-Flow assay, which is based on the recognition of S at the cell surface by flow-cytometry, and the LIPS assay that recognizes diverse antigens (including S1 or N C-terminal domain) by immunoprecipitation. Overall, the results obtained with the four assays were similar, with differences in sensitivity that can be attributed to the technique and the antigen in use. High antibody titers were associated with neutralisation activity, assessed using infectious SARS-CoV-2 or lentiviral-S pseudotypes. In hospitalized patients, seroconversion and neutralisation occurred on 5-14 days post symptom onset, confirming previous studies. Seropositivity was detected in 29% of pauci-symptomatic individuals within 15 days post-symptoms and 3 % of blood of healthy donors collected in the area of a cluster of COVID cases.

27792,Investigating the intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccination in Macao: implications for vaccination strategies,"ImportanceUnderstanding the intention of receiving COVID-19 vaccines is important for informing effective vaccination strategies especially for areas with low incidence.

ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the intention to receive COVID-19 vaccination, identify the key influencing factors, and determine the most important intention predictors using a theoretically principled model.

Design, setting, and participantsThis was a cross-sectional online survey study hosted by Survey Monkey and implemented for 10 days from May 14 2021. People who aged 18 years or above and had been residing in Macao for 12 months prior to the study were recruited through social media.

Main outcomes and measuresIntention, the constructs of protection motivation theory (perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, maladaptive response reward, self-efficacy, response-efficacy, and response cost), constructs of health belief model (cues to action), social attitude, social norm, past experience and information seeking behavior, in addition to demographic variables.

ResultsOf the 552 respondents, 79.5% aged between 25 and 54 years old, 59.4% were female, and 88% had a bachelor degree or above. Overall, 62.3% of the respondents indicated their intention while 19.2% were hesitant and 18.5% did not have any intention. While 67.0% believed COVID-19 infection was life-threatening, only 19.0% thought they were at risk. Control variables such as age, gender, education level, and having travel plans were significantly correlated with intention. Significant associations were found between intention and all the measures (p<0.05). The most important positive predictors of intention were """"being able to make arrangement to receive the vaccine"""" ({beta} = 0.333, P <0.001), """"a sense of social responsibility"""" ({beta} = 0.326, P < 0.001), and """"time off from work after vaccination"""" ({beta} = 0.169, P <0.001), whereas """"concerns over vaccine safety"""" ({beta} = - 0.124, P < 0.001) and """"relying on online resources for vaccine information"""" ({beta} = -0.065, P <0.05) were negative predictors. Perceived severity was not a predictor of intention.

Conclusion and relevanceMulti-component strategies that address various factors affecting intention are needed to formulate effective interventions. Health literacy, vaccination convenience, social responsibility, reasonable incentives and well-informed risk and benefit analysis are recommended consideration for future vaccination campaigns.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the intention to receive COVID-19 vaccination in Macao and the influencing factors?

FindingsA cross-sectional study involving 552 respondents found that the intention rate of COVID-19 vaccination was 62.3% in Macao. Positive predictors of intention included being able to make arrangement to receive the vaccine, a sense of social responsibility, and an offer of time off from work after vaccination. Concerns over vaccine safety and relying on online resources for vaccine information were negative predictors.

16321,SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection using pooling of self-collected samples: Simple protocols may foster asymptomatic surveillance,"1BackgroundSurveillance of COVID infection and isolation of infected individuals is one of the available tools to control the spread of SAR-CoV-2. Asymptomatic and pre symptomatic are responsible for substantial transmission. RNA or antigen tests are necessary to identify non-symptomatic individuals. We tested the feasibility of using samples pooling offering different collection alternatives (swab/throat wash/saliva) to volunteers of a public health institute.

MethodsWe evaluated pool samples from frozen material from previously tested samples and a prospective collection from asymptomatic volunteers. Some collections were paired for comparison. Pools and some individual samples were extracted with QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA) and/or Lucigen Quick Extract DNA extraction solution (BioSearch, USA) and submitted to rtPCR (Allplex, Seegene, Korea).

ResultsA total of 240 samples from 130 new collections and 37 samples with known result were evaluated. Pool CT was generally higher than individual samples. Lucigen extraction showed higher CT, including false negative results for samples with high CT at Qiagen extraction. Paired Swab and TW samples showed comparable results. No volunteer from negative pools reported any symptom in the 2-3 days after collection.

ConclusionsClinical samples pooling to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA is feasible and an economical way to test for COVID-19, especially in surveillance strategies targeting more infectiousness, higher viremia individuals. The use of Lucigen reagents show lower sensibility that may lead to false negative results with lower viremia samples. Combining throat wash with saliva may provide and interesting self-collection alternative, but more comparative work is needed.","Lopes, G. I. S. L.; Carmona, R. D. C. C.; Silva, V. O.; Ahagon, C.

16414,Assessing the Impact of Area Deprivation Index on COVID-19 Prevalence: A Contrast Between Rural and Urban U.S. Jurisdictions,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted communities differentially, with poorer and minority populations being more adversely affected. Prior rural health research suggests such disparities may be exacerbated during the pandemic and in remote parts of the U.S.

ObjectivesTo understand the spread and impact of COVID-19 across the U.S., county level data for confirmed cases of COVID-19 were examined by Area Deprivation Index (ADI) scores and Metropolitan vs. Nonmetropolitan designations from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). These designations were the basis for making comparisons between Urban and Rural jurisdictions.

MethodsKendalls Tau-B was used to compare effect sizes between jurisdictions on select ADI composites and well researched social determinants of health (SDH). Spearman coefficients and a moderation analysis using Poisson modeling was used to explore the relationship between ADI and COVID-19 prevalence in the context of county designation.

ResultsResults show that the relationship between area deprivation and COVID-19 prevalence was positive and higher for rural counties, when compared to urban ones and that family income and poverty had a stronger relationship with prevalence than other ADI component measures.

ConclusionsThough most Americans live in Metropolitan Areas, rural communities were found to be associated with a stronger relationship between deprivation and COVID-19 prevalence. Models for predicting COVID-19 prevalence by ADI and county type reinforced this observation but revealed no moderating effect of county type on ADI.","Kitchen, C.; Hatef, E.; Chang, H.

AimsThe purpose of this study was to summarize the incidence of liver injury and the differences between liver injury markers among different patients with COVID-19 in China.

MethodsComputer searches of PubMed, Embase, CNKI and medRxiv were used to obtain reports on the incidence and markers of liver injury in Chinese patients with COVID-19, from January 1, 2020 to April 10, 2020. (No. CRD42020181350)

ResultsA total of 57 reports from China were included, including 9889 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. The results of the meta-analysis showed that among the patients with early COVID-19 infection in China, the incidence of liver injury events was 24.7% (95% CI, 23.4%-26.4%). Liver injury in severe patients was more common than that in non-severe patients, with a risk ratio of 2.07 (95% CI, 1.77 to 2.43). Quantitative analysis showed that the severe the coronavirus infection, the higher the level of AST, ALT, TB, ALP, GGT and the lower the level of ALB. The changing trend of the appeal index was similar in ICU patients and dead patients.

ConclusionThere is a certain risk of liver injury in Chinese patients with COVID-19, and the risk and degree of liver injury are related to the severity of COVID-19.","Zhao, X.; Lei, Z.",2020-05-08,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.03.20089557,1,Zehua Lei,"1.

14904,Model-informed COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies by age and serostatus,"When a vaccine for COVID-19 becomes available, limited initial supply will raise the question of how to prioritize the available doses and thus underscores the need for transparent, evidence-based strategies that relate knowledge of, and uncertainty in, disease transmission, risk, vaccine efficacy, and existing population immunity. Here, we employ a model-informed approach to vaccine prioritization that evaluates the impact of prioritization strategies on cumulative incidence and mortality and accounts for population factors such as age, contact structure, and seroprevalence, and vaccine factors including imperfect and age-varying efficacy. This framework can be used to evaluate and compare existing strategies, and it can also be used to derive an optimal prioritization strategy to minimize mortality or incidence. We find that a transmission-blocking vaccine should be prioritized to adults ages 20-49y to minimize cumulative incidence and to adults over 60y to minimize mortality. Direct vaccination of adults over 60y minimizes mortality for vaccines that do not block transmission. We also estimate the potential benefit of using individual-level serological tests to redirect doses to only seronegative individuals, improving the marginal impact of each dose. We argue that this serology-informed vaccination approach may improve the efficiency of vaccination efforts while partially addressing existing inequities in COVID-19 burden and impact.","Bubar, K.

19880,Determinants of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to guide vaccination strategy in an urban area,"BackgroundTransmission chains within small urban areas (accommodating[~]30% of the European population) greatly contribute to case burden and economic impact during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and should be a focus for preventive measures to achieve containment. Here, at very high spatio-temporal resolution, we analysed determinants of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a European urban area, Basel-City (Switzerland). Methodology. We combined detailed epidemiological, intra-city mobility, and socioeconomic data-sets with whole-genome-sequencing during the first SARS-CoV-2 wave. For this, we succeeded in sequencing 44% of all reported cases from Basel-City and performed phylogenetic clustering and compartmental modelling based on the dominating viral variant (B.1-C15324T; 60% of cases) to identify drivers and patterns of transmission. Based on these results we simulated vaccination scenarios and corresponding healthcare-system burden (intensive-care-unit occupancy). Principal Findings. Transmissions were driven by socioeconomically weaker and highly mobile population groups with mostly cryptic transmissions, whereas amongst more senior population transmission was clustered. Simulated vaccination scenarios assuming 60-90% transmission reduction, and 70-90% reduction of severe cases showed that prioritizing mobile, socioeconomically weaker populations for vaccination would effectively reduce case numbers. However, long-term intensive-care-unit occupation would also be effectively reduced if senior population groups were prioritized, provided there were no changes in testing and prevention strategies. Conclusions. Reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission through vaccination strongly depends on the efficacy of the deployed vaccine. A combined strategy of protecting risk groups by extensive testing coupled with vaccination of the drivers of transmission (i.e. highly mobile groups) would be most effective at reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within an urban area.

Author summaryWe examined SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns within a European city (Basel, Switzerland) to infer drivers of the transmission during the first wave in spring 2020. The combination of diverse data (serological, genomic, transportation, socioeconomic) allowed us to combine phylogenetic analysis with mathematical modelling on related cases that were mapped to a residential address. As a result we could evaluate population groups driving SARS-CoV-2 transmission and quantify their effect on the transmission dynamics. We found traceable transmission chains in wealthier or more senior population groups and cryptic transmissions in the mobile, young or socioeconomic weaker population groups - these were identified as transmission drivers of the first wave. Based on this insight, we simulated vaccination scenarios for various vaccine efficacies to reflect different approaches undertaken to handle the epidemic. We conclude that vaccination of the mobile inherently younger population group would be most effective to handle following waves.","Brueningk, S.

9926,Predictive Modeling on the Number of Covid-19 Death Toll in the United States Considering the Effects of Coronavirus-Related Changes and Covid-19 Recovered Cases,"COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Many countries around the world implemented their own policies and restrictions designed to limit the spread of Covid-19 in recent months. Businesses and schools transitioned into working and learning remotely. In the United States, many states were under strict orders to stay home at least in the month of April. In recent weeks, there are some significant changes related restrictions include social-distancing, reopening states, and staying-at-home orders. The United States surpassed 2 million coronavirus cases on Monday, June 15, 2020 less than five months after the first case was confirmed in the country. The virus has killed at least 115,000 people in the United States as of Monday, June 15, 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

With the recent easing of coronavirus-related restrictions and changes on business and social activity such as stay-at-home, social distancing since late May 2020 hoping to restore economic and business activities, new Covid-19 outbreaks are on the rise in many states across the country. Some researchers expressed concern that the process of easing restrictions and relaxing stay-at-home orders too soon could quickly surge the number of infected Covid-19 cases as well as the death toll in the United States. Some of these increases, however, could be due to more testing sites in the communities while others may be are the results of easing restrictions due to recent reopening and changed policies, though the number of daily death toll does not appear to be going down in recent days due to Covid-19 in the U.S. This raises the challenging question: O_LIHow can policy decision-makers and community leaders make the decision to implement public policies and restrictions and keep or lift staying-at-home orders of ongoing Covid-19 pandemic for their communities in a scientific way?
C_LI

In this study, we aim to develop models addressing the effects of recent Covid-19 related changes in the communities such as reopening states, practicing social-distancing, and staying-at-home orders. Our models account for the fact that changes to these policies which can lead to a surge of coronavius cases and deaths, especially in the United States. Specifically, in this paper we develop a novel generalized mathematical model and several explicit models considering the effects of recent reopening states, staying-at-home orders and social-distancing practice of different communities along with a set of selected indicators such as the total number of coronavirus recovered and new cases that can estimate the daily death toll and total number of deaths in the United States related to Covid-19 virus. We compare the modeling results among the developed models based on several existing criteria. The model also can be used to predict the number of death toll in Italy and the United Kingdom (UK). The results show very encouraging predictability for the proposed models in this study.

The model predicts that 128,500 to 140,100 people in the United States will have died of Covid-19 by July 4, 2020. The model also predicts that between 137,900 and 154,000 people will have died of Covid-19 by July 31, and 148,500 to 169,700 will have died by the end of August 2020, as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19 based on the Covid-19 death data available on June 13, 2020.

The model also predicts that 34,900 to 37,200 people in Italy will have died of Covid-19 by July 4, and 36,900 to 40,400 people will have died by the end of August based on the data available on June 13, 2020. The model also predicts that between 43,500 and 46,700 people in the United Kingdom will have died of Covid-19 by July 4, and 48,700 to 51,900 people will have died by the end of August, as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19 based on the data available on June 13, 2020.

11072,Global Assessment of the Relationship between Government Response Measures and COVID-19 Deaths,"ObjectiveTo provide an early global assessment of the impact of government stringency measures on the rate of growth in deaths from COVID-19. We hypothesized that the overall stringency of a governments interventions and the speed of implementation would affect the growth and level of deaths related to COVID-19 in that country.

DesignObservational study based on an original database of global governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Daily data was collected on a range of containment and closure policies for 170 countries from January 1, 2020 until May 27, 2020 by a team of researchers at Oxford University, UK. These data were combined into an aggregate stringency index (SI) score for each country on each day (range: 0-100). Regression was used to show correlations between the speed and strength of government stringency and deaths related to COVID-19 with a number of controls for time and country-specific demographic, health system, and economic characteristics.

InterventionsNine non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school and work closures, restrictions on international and domestic travel, public gathering bans, public information campaigns, as well as testing and contact tracing policies.

Main outcomes measuresThe primary outcome was deaths related to COVID-19, measured both in terms of maximum daily deaths and growth rate of daily deaths.

ResultsFor each day of delay to reach an SI 40, the average daily growth rate in deaths was 0.087 percentage points higher (0.056 to 0.118, P<0.001). In turn, each additional point on the SI was associated with a 0.080 percentage point lower average daily growth rate (-0.121 to -0.039, P<.001). These daily differences in growth rates lead to large cumulative differences in total deaths. For example, a week delay in enacting policy measures to SI 40 would lead to 1.7 times as many deaths overall.

ConclusionsA lower degree of government stringency and slower response times were associated with more deaths from COVID-19. These findings highlight the importance of non-pharmaceutical responses to COVID-19 as more robust testing, treatment, and vaccination measures are developed.","Hale, T.; Hale, A.

27288,The potential impact of vaccine passports on inclination to accept COVID-19 vaccinations in the United Kingdom: evidence from a large cross-sectional survey and modelling study,"BackgroundFour vaccines against the novel coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have currently been approved for use in the United Kingdom. As of 30 April 2021, over 34 million adults have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The UK Government is considering the introduction of vaccine passports for domestic use and to facilitate international travel for UK residents. Although vaccine incentivisation has been cited as a motivating factor for vaccine passports, it is currently unclear whether vaccine passports are likely to increase inclination to accept a COVID-19 vaccine.

MethodsWe conducted a large-scale national survey in the UK of 17,611 adults between 9 and 27 April 2021. Bayesian multilevel regression and poststratification is used to provide unbiased national-level estimates of the impact of the introduction of vaccine passports on inclination to accept COVID-19 vaccines among all respondents who have not yet had two vaccination doses. Multilevel regressions identify the differential impact of the likely impact of vaccine passports on uptake intent between socio-demographic groups. Gibbs sampling was used for Bayesian model inference, with 95% highest posterior density intervals used to capture uncertainty in all parameter estimates.

FindingsWe find that the introduction of vaccine passports will likely lower inclination to accept a COVID-19 vaccine once baseline vaccination intent has been adjusted for. Notably, this decrease is larger if passports were required for domestic use rather than for facilitating international travel. The impact of passports while controlling for baseline vaccination intent differentially impacts individuals by socio-demographic status, with being male (OR 0{middle dot}87, 0{middle dot}76 to 0{middle dot}99) and having degree qualifications (OR 0{middle dot}84, 0{middle dot}72 to 0{middle dot}94) associated with a decreased inclination to vaccinate if passports were required for domestic use, while Christians (OR 1{middle dot}23, 1{middle dot}08 to 1{middle dot}41) have an increased inclination over atheists or agnostics. There is a strong association between change in vaccination inclination if passports were introduced and baseline vaccination intent: stated change in vaccination inclination is thus lower among Black or Black British respondents (compared to Whites), younger age groups, and non-English speakers. We find notable sub-national trends, for example, that passports could increase inclination among students and Jewish respondents in London compared to those in full-time education or atheists or agnostics, respectively.

InterpretationTo our knowledge, this is the first quantitative assessment of the potential impact of the introduction of vaccine passports on COVID-19 vaccine intention. Our findings should be interpreted in light of sub-national trends in current uptake rates across the UK, as our results suggest that vaccine passports may induce a lower vaccination inclination in socio-demographic groups that cluster geographically in large urban areas. Caution should therefore be exercised in introducing passports as they may result in less positive health-seeking behaviours for the COVID-19 vaccine (as well as other existing or future vaccinations) and may contribute to concentrated areas of low vaccinate uptake, which is an epidemic risk. We call for further evidence on the impact of vaccine certification on confidence in COVID-19 vaccines and in routine immunisations in wider global settings and, in particular, in countries with low overall trust in vaccinations or in authorities that administer or recommend vaccines.

FundingThis survey was funded by the Merck Investigator Studies Program (MISP)

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSProof of vaccination has, to date, had limited use in public and private settings for the UK public, such as proof of yellow fever vaccination for international travel to limited destinations, or requirements of Hepatitis B vaccination in some medical roles. Although recent surveys have suggested that the majority of the British public support vaccine passports, we are not aware of any studies assessing the impact that proof of vaccination status for domestic use or for international travel may have on vaccination inclination and thus--perhaps more importantly--on epidemic spread.

Added value of this studyWe conducted a large-scale survey of more than 17,000 members of the UK public to explore attitudes to vaccine passports for domestic and international use. Bayesian methods are used to compute nationally representative estimates of the impact of vaccine passports on change in inclination to accept COVID-19 vaccines and to establish the socio-demographic determinants of vaccination inclination. This study is, as far as we are aware, the first to assess the impact of vaccine passports on vaccination inclination in the UK.

Implications of all the possible evidenceThis study provides novel insights into the potential impact of vaccine passports on COVID-19 vaccine intent in the UK. Although we find that vaccine passports receive popular support in the UK, there exists large variations in their appeal that stratify along socio-demographic lines. Most notably, younger age groups, Black and Black British ethnicities (compared to Whites), and non-English speakers are more likely to express a lower inclination to vaccinate if passports were introduced. Although these groups comprise a relatively small proportion of the UK population, there are crucial issues that these perceptions among these groups cause: notably, that these groups tend to have lower baseline vaccination intent and they cluster geographically. Therefore, since geographic clusters of low vaccination uptake can result in disproportionate increases in required vaccination levels for herd immunity in adjacent settings, we need to exercise extreme caution in public health interventions that may push these areas further away from vaccination. This is especially so if such an intervention will have little overall impact on the majority of the population outside these areas who are already quite willing to vaccinate. Overall, we find that the introduction of passports for either domestic or international use has a net negative impact on vaccination inclination, once we control for baseline vaccination intent. Our findings suggest that vaccination passports may not only yield damaging health outcomes for already marginalised communities: this may lead to further distrust in the government and public health systems and may have negative downstream consequences for other health-seeking behaviours, for example, routine immunisations.","De Figueiredo, A.; Larson, H.

5518,"Demographic and Socio-Economic Factors, and Healthcare Resource Indicators Associated with the Rapid Spread of COVID-19 in Northern Italy: An Ecological Study","BackgroundCOVID-19 rapidly escalated into a pandemic, threatening 213 countries, areas, and territories the world over. We aimed to identify potential province-level socioeconomic determinants of the viruss dissemination, and explain between-province differences in the speed of its spread, based on data from 36 provinces of Northern Italy.

MethodsThis is an ecological study. We included all confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 reported between February 24th and March 30th, 2020. For each province, we calculated the trend of contagion as the relative increase in the number of individuals infected between two time endpoints, assuming an exponential growth. Pearsons test was used to correlate the trend of contagion with a set of healthcare-associated, economic, and demographic parameters by province. The viruss spread was input as a dependent variable in a stepwise OLS regression model to test the association between rate of spread and province-level indicators.

FindingsMultivariate analysis showed that the spread of COVID-19 was correlated negatively with aging index (p-value=0.003), and positively with public transportation per capita (p-value=0.012), the % of private long-term care hospital beds and, to a lesser extent (p-value=0.070), the % of private acute care hospital beds (p-value=0.006).

InterpretationDemographic and socioeconomic factors, and healthcare organization variables were found associated with a significant difference in the rate of COVID-19 spread in 36 provinces of Northern Italy. An aging population seemed to naturally contain social contacts. The availability of healthcare resources and their coordination could play an important part in spreading infection.","Buja, A.; Paganini, M.; Cocchio, S.; Scioni, M.; Rebba, V.; Baldo, V.",2020-04-29,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.04.25.20078311,1,Matteo Paganini,"Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20078311v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20078311v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1371/journal.pone.0244535
11733,A sensitive and affordable multiplex RT-qPCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection,"With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, there is need for sensitive, specific and affordable diagnostic tests to identify infected individuals, not all of whom are symptomatic. The most sensitive test involves the detection of viral RNA using RT-qPCR, with many commercial kits now available for this purpose. However, these are expensive and supply of such kits in sufficient numbers cannot always be guaranteed. We therefore developed a multiplex assay using well-established SARS-CoV-2 targets alongside internal controls that monitor sample quality and nucleic acid extraction efficiency. Here, we establish that this test performs as well as widely used commercial assays, but at substantially reduced cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate >1,000-fold variability in material routinely collected by nose-and-throat swabbing. The inclusion of a human control probe in our assay provides additional information that could help reduce false negative rates.","Reijns, M. A.; Thompson, L.; Acosta, J. C.; Black, H.

4845,Controlled Avalanche: A Regulated Voluntary Exposure Approach for Addressing Covid19,"BackgroundThe ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has driven many countries to take radical suppression measures. While reducing mortality, these measures result in severe economic repercussions, and inhibit the development of herd immunity. Until an effective vaccine will be available, we propose an alternative approach, akin to avalanche control at ski resorts, a practice which intentionally triggers small avalanches in order to prevent a singular catastrophic one. Its main goal is to approach herd immunity faster than the current alternatives, with lower mortality rates and lower demand for critical health-care resources. According to this approach, individuals whose probability of developing serious health conditions is low (i.e. 20-49 years old with no comorbidities) will be offered the option to be voluntarily exposed to the virus under controlled supervision, and will then be issued  immunity certificates if they are confirmed to have developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

MethodsUsing a compartmental model we examine the implications of the controlled avalanche (CA) strategy over the population in Israel. We compare four scenarios: in two scenarios the CA program is applied to the low-risk population (with the rest of the population subject to mitigation measures), followed by mitigation for the entire population or by uncontrolled spread. These are compared to mitigated and uncontrolled scenarios without the CA program. We discuss the economic, ethical and public health implications of the CA strategy.

FindingsWe show that compared to mitigation of the entire population, the CA strategy reduces the overall mortality by 43%, reduces the maximum number of people in need for ICUs by 62% and decreases the time required for release of 50% of the low-risk population by more than 2 months.

InterpretationThis study suggests an ethically acceptable practice, that enables reaching herd immunity faster than the current alternatives, with low mortality and minimal economic damage.","Klement, E.; Klement, A.; Chinitz, D.; Harel, A.; Fattal, E.; Klausner, Z.",2020-04-22,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.12.20062687,1,Eyal Klement,"Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.12.20062687v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.12.20062687v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
2562,Relationship between the ABO Blood Group and the COVID-19 Susceptibility,"The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading around the world rapidly and declared as a pandemic by WHO. Here, we compared the ABO blood group distribution in 2,173 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 test from three hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China with that in normal people from the corresponding regions. The results showed that blood group A was associated with a higher risk for acquiring COVID-19 compared with non-A blood groups, whereas blood group O was associated with a lower risk for the infection compared with non-O blood groups. This is the first observation of an association between the ABO blood type and COVID-19. It should be emphasized, however, that this is an early study with limitations. It would be premature to use this study to guide clinical practice at this time, but it should encourage further investigation of the relationship between the ABO blood group and the COVID-19 susceptibility.","Zhao, J.; Yang, Y.; Huang, H.; Li, D.; Gu, D.; Lu, X.; Zhang, Z.; Liu, L.; Liu, T.; Liu, Y.; He, Y.; Sun, B.; Wei, M.; Yang, G.; Wang, X.; Zhang, L.; Zhou, X.; Xing, M.; Wang, P.

18058,COVID-19 pandemic risk analytics: Data mining with reliability engineering methods for analyzing spreading behavior and comparison with infectious diseases,"In December 2019, the world was confronted with the outbreak of the respiratory disease COVID-19 (Corona). The first infection (confirmed case) was detected in the City Wuhan, Hubei, China. First, it was an epidemic in China, but in the first quarter of 2020, it evolved into a pandemic, which continues to this day. The COVID-19 pandemic with its incredible speed of spread shows the vulnerability of a globalized and networked world. The first months of the pandemic were characterized by heavy burden on health systems. Worldwide, the population of countries was affected with severe restrictions, like educational system shutdown, public traffic system breakdown or a comprehensive lockdown. The severity of the burden was dependent on many factors, e.g. government, culture or health system. However, the burden happened regarding each country with slight time lags, cf. Bracke et al. (2020). This paper focuses on data analytics regarding infection data of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a continuation of the research study COVID-19 pandemic data analytics: Data heterogeneity, spreading behavior, and lockdown impact, published by Bracke et al. (2020). The goal of this assessment is the evaluation/analysis of infection data mining considering model uncertainty, pandemic spreading behavior with lockdown impact and early second wave in Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand and France. Furthermore, a comparison with other infectious diseases (measles and influenza) is made. The used data base from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) runs from 01/22/2020 until 09/22/2020 with daily data, the dynamic development after 09/22/2020 is not considered. The measles/influenza analytics are based on Robert Koch Institute (RKI) data base 09/22/2020. Statistical models and methods from reliability engineering like Weibull distribution model or trend test are used to analyze the occurrence of infection.","Puls, A.; Bracke, S.",2020-11-12,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.11.08.20227322,1,Stefan Bracke,University of Wuppertal,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.08.20227322v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.08.20227322v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
13648,A data-driven epidemiological model to explain the Covid-19 pandemic in multiple countries and help in choosing mitigation strategies,"Accurate models are fundamental to understand the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate different mitigation strategies. Here, we present a multi-compartmental model that fits the epidemiological data for eleven countries, despite the reduced number of fitting parameters. This model consistently explains the data for the daily infected, recovered, and dead over the first six months of the pandemic. The good quality of the fits makes it possible to explore different scenarios and evaluate the impact of both individual and collective behaviors and government-level decisions to mitigate the epidemic. We identify robust alternatives to lockdown, such as self-protection measures, and massive testing. Furthermore, communication and risk perception are fundamental to modulate the success of different strategies. The fitting/simulation tool is publicly available for use and test of other models, allowing for comparisons between different underlying assumptions, mitigation measures, and policy recommendations.","Beira, M.

5220,What can trends in hospital deaths from COVID-19 tell us about the progress and peak of the pandemic? An analysis of death counts from England announced up to 25 April 2020,"BackgroundReporting of daily hospital COVID-19 deaths in the UK are promoted by the government and scientific advisers alike as a key metric for assessing the progress in the control of the epidemic. These data, however, have certain limitations, among which one of the most significant concerns the fact that the daily totals span deaths that have occurred between 1 and 10 days or more in the past.

Data and methodsWe obtained daily data published published by NHS England up to and including April 25 in the form of Excel spreadsheets in which deaths counts are presented by date of death according to age and region. Simple descriptive analyses were conducted and presented in graphical and tabular form which were aimed at illustrating the biases inherent in focussing on daily counts regardless of when the deaths occurred. We then looked at how a less biased picture could be obtained by looking at trends in death counts stratifying by individual period of delay in days between occurrence of death and when the death was included in the daily announcement.

FindingsThe number of hospital COVID-19 deaths announced daily overestimates the maximum number of deaths actually occurring so far in the epidemic in the UK, and also obscures the pattern of decline in deaths. Taking account of reporting delays suggests that for England as a whole a peak in hospital COVID-19 deaths may have been reached on April 8 with a subsequent gradual decline suggested. The same peak is also seen among those aged 60-79 and 80+, although there is slightly shallower decline in the oldest age group (80+ years). Among those aged 40-59 years a later peak on April 11 is evident. London shows a peak on April 8 and a clearer and steeper pattern of subsequent decline compared to England as a whole.

InterpretationAnalyses of mortality trends must take account of delay, and in communication with the public more emphasis should be placed on looking at trends based on deaths that occurred 5 or more days prior to the announcement day. The slightly weaker decline seen at age 80+ may reflect increased hospitalisation of people from care homes, whereas the later peak under the age of 60 years may reflect the higher proportions at these younger ages being admitted to critical care resulting in an extension of life of several days.

16096,Forecasting the SARS-CoV-2 effective reproduction number using bulk proximity data from mobile phones,"Over the last months, cases of SARS-CoV-2 surged repeatedly in many countries and could often be controlled with non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing. We analyzed de-identified GPS tracking data from 1.15 to 1.4 million cell phones in Germany per day between March-November 2020 to identify encounters between individuals and statistically evaluate large-scale contact behavior. Using graph sampling theory we estimated the contact index (CI), a metric for number and heterogeneity of contacts and found that the contact index, and not the total number of contacts, is an accurate predsictor for the effective reproduction number R. A high correlation between CI and R occurring more than two weeks later allows timely assessment of the social behavior well before the infections become detectable. The CI quantifies the role of superspreading and allows assigning risks to specific contact behavior. We provide a critical CI-value beyond which R is expected to rise above 1 and propose to use it to leverage the social distancing interventions for the coming months.","Ruediger, S.; Konigorski, S.; Edelman, J.; Zernick, D.; Thieme, A.

4281,Neuropsychiatric adverse events of chloroquine: A real-world pharmacovigilance study using the FAERS database,"ObjectivesAs of the early April 2020, the antimalarial drug, chloroquine, has been approved as an emergency treatment for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States and in Europe. Although infrequent, neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients who received chloroquine for the treatment of malaria or autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated these adverse events (AEs) using a large self-reporting database.

Materials and MethodsWe conducted a disproportionality analysis for the detection of neuropsychiatric AE signals associated with the use of chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), reported to FAERS database between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted reporting odds ratio (ROR) for the development of each of the neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine was calculated using a multilevel model.

ResultsWe included 2,389,474 AE cases, among which 520 cases developed neuropsychiatric AE following the use of chloroquine. Exposure to chloroquine was associated with a statistically significant high reporting of amnesia, delirium, hallucinations, depression, and loss of consciousness, (lower 95% confidence interval of the adjusted ROR > 1), although the degree of increase in their ROR was limited. There was no statistically significant high reporting of any other neuropsychiatric AE, including suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation.

ConclusionCurrent pharmacovigilance study results did not suggest any potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation, which would be informative during the emergency use of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.","Sato, K.; Mano, T.; Iwata, A.; Toda, T.",2020-04-14,Neurology,10.1101/2020.04.10.20061358,1,Atsushi Iwata,Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Medical Center Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20061358v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20061358v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.5582/bst.2020.03082
27160,Cellular and humoral immunogenicity of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine in patients on hemodialysis,"BackgroundPatients with chronic renal insufficiency on intermittent hemodialysis face an increased risk of COVID-19 induced mortality and impaired vaccine responses. To date, only few studies addressed SARS-CoV-2 vaccine elicited immunity in this immunocompromised population.

MethodsWe assessed immunogenicity of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 in at risk dialysis patients and characterized systemic cellular and humoral immune responses in serum and saliva using interferon {gamma} release assay and multiplex-based cytokine and immunoglobulin measurements. We further compared binding capacity and neutralization efficacy of vaccination-induced immunoglobulins against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.429 and Cluster 5 by ACE2-RBD competition assay.

FindingsPatients on intermittent hemodialysis exhibit detectable but variable cellular and humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern after a two-dose regimen of BNT162b2. Although vaccination-induced immunoglobulins were detectable in saliva and plasma, both anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralization efficacy was reduced compared to controls. Similarly, T-cell mediated interferon {gamma} release after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides was significantly diminished.

InterpretationQuantifiable humoral and cellular immune responses after BNT162b2 vaccination in individuals on intermittent dialysis are encouraging, but urge for longitudinal follow-up to assess longevity of immunity. Diminished virus neutralization and interferon {gamma} responses in face of emerging variants of concern may favor this at risk population for re-vaccination using modified vaccines at the earliest opportunity.

Research in the contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPatients on dialysis tend to have a reduced immune response to both infection and vaccination. We searched PubMed and MedRxiv for studies including search terms such as """"COVID-19"""", """"vaccine"""", and """"dialysis"""" but no peer-reviewed studies to date assessed both SARS-CoV-2 specific B- and T-cell responses, mucosal immunoglobulins, and considered the impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in this at risk population.

Added value of the studyWe provide a comprehensive functional characterization of both T- and B-cell responses following a two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 in at risk patients on maintenance hemodialysis. More importantly, to the best of our knowledge, we assess for the first time binding and neutralization capacity of vaccination-induced circulation and mucosal antibodies towards emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in an immunocompromised population.

Implications of all the available evidencePatients on maintenance hemodialysis develop a substantial cellular and humoral immune response following the BNT162b2 vaccine. These findings should encourage patients on intermittent hemodialysis to receive the vaccine. However, we suggest continuing additional protection measures against variants of concern in this at risk population until longevity of the vaccine response is fully evaluated.","Strengert, M.; Becker, M.; Morilla Ramos, G.; Dulovic, A.; Gruber, J.; Juengling, J.; Luerken, K.; Beigel, A.; Wrenger, E.; Lonnemann, G.; Cossmann, A.; Stankov, M.

5528,Forecast analysis of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in the United States by a generalized fractional-order SEIR model,"In this paper, a generalized fractional-order SEIR model is proposed, denoted by SEIQRP model, which has a basic guiding significance for the prediction of the possible outbreak of infectious diseases like COVID-19 and other insect diseases in the future. Firstly, some qualitative properties of the model are analyzed. The basic reproduction number R0 is derived. When R0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium point is unique and locally asymptotically stable. When R0 > 1, the endemic equilibrium point is also unique. Furthermore, some conditions are established to ensure the local asymptotic stability of disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. The trend of COVID-19 spread in the United States is predicted. Considering the influence of the individual behavior and government mitigation measurement, a modified SEIQRP model is proposed, defined as SEIQRPD model. According to the real data of the United States, it is found that our improved model has a better prediction ability for the epidemic trend in the next two weeks. Hence, the epidemic trend of the United States in the next two weeks is investigated, and the peak of isolated cases are predicted. The modified SEIQRP model successfully capture the development process of COVID-19, which provides an important reference for understanding the trend of the outbreak.","Xu, C.; Yu, Y.; Chen, Y.; Lu, Z.",2020-05-03,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.24.20078493,2,Yangquan Chen,University of California Merced,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.24.20078493v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.24.20078493v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1007/s11071-020-05946-3

ObjectiveObjective of the study is to assume the number of positive case and death till 30th December, 2020 in Bangladesh.

Study designThis study was designed with systematic review and data analysis.

MethodThe study was completed by analyzing data available on website. First COVID 19 case in Bangladesh was identified on 8th March. Analyzing the data increasing rate/common ratio of infection and death has been identified. Then this common ratio has been used in the formula of multiplication series (at decreasing rate). Data of China, Iran, Italy and the USA was also analyzed to assume how the death and case number increased. Social issues of Bangladesh were also analyzed. Considering all these the assumption was made.

ResultIt has been assumed that by the 43rd week (on 30th December, 2020) of first identification the total case can be 15640747 and total death can be 638769 by 30 December, 2020. As this is an assumption this can be true, partially true or false. But the base of assumption is strong enough so the possibility of being true or nearly true is higher.

9648,An international assessment of the COVID-19 pandemic using ensemble data assimilation,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThis work shows how one can use iterative ensemble smoothers to effectively estimate parameters of an SEIR model with age-classes and compartments of sick, hospitalized, and dead. The data conditioned on are the daily numbers of accumulated deaths and the number of hospitalized. Also, it is possible to condition on the number of cases obtained from testing. We start from a wide prior distribution for the model parameters; then, the ensemble conditioning leads to a posterior ensemble of estimated parameters leading to model predictions in close agreement with the observations. The updated ensemble of model simulations have predictive capabilities and include uncertainty estimates. In particular, we estimate the effective reproductive number as a function of time, and we can assess the impact of different intervention measures. By starting from the updated set of model parameters, we can make accurate short-term predictions of the epidemic development given knowledge of the future effective reproductive number. Also, the model system allows for the computation of long-term scenarios of the epidemic under different assumptions. We have applied the model system on data sets from several countries with vastly different developments of the epidemic, and we can accurately model the development of the COVID-19 outbreak in these countries. We realize that more complex models, e.g., with regional compartments, may be desirable, and we suggest that the approach used here should be applicable also for these models.","Evensen, G.; Amezcua, J.; Bocquet, M.; Carrassi, A.; Farchi, A.; Fowler, A.; Houtekamer, P.; Jones, C.

16125,The Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Uptake of Influenza Vaccine: A UK-Wide Observational Study,"ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to measure the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on acceptance of flu vaccination in the 2020-21 season, including for those newly eligible for the UK National Health Service (NHS) free vaccination programme, extended this year to include an estimated 32.4 million (48.8%) of the UK population. Knowing intended uptake is essential to inform supply and steer public health messaging to maximise vaccination given the combined threats of both flu and Covid-19 -- the unknown impact of which on both attitudes and the need for mass uptake yet again create the threat of ill-informed planning resulting in failure to meet necessary public health demand.

MethodsAn online questionnaire posing question items on influenza vaccination was administered to registrants of the Care Information Exchange (CIE), the NHSs largest patient electronic personal health record. This was part of a longitudinal study initiated during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. This analysis was limited to those who, in line with established NHS criteria, were previously or newly eligible but had not routinely received seasonal influenza vaccination in the past. Groups were stratified by response (yes/no) to intending to receive flu vaccination in 2020-21: Group 1.) Previously eligible now responding  yes, 2.) Previously eligible still responding  no, 3.) Newly eligible responding  yes, and 4.) Newly eligible responding  no. Within these groups, response by health worker status and each groups inclination to vaccinate school age children was also measured. Summary statistics were reported alongside univariate and multivariable regression. Lastly, a network analysis visualised the frequency and co-occurrence of reasons qualifying response for or against influenza vaccination in 2020/21.

FindingsAmong 6,641 respondents, 4,040 (61.1%) had previously routinely received the flu vaccination. 1,624 (24.5%) had been either previously eligible but not vaccinated (945, 58.2%) or newly eligible (679, 41.8%). Among the previously eligible participants who had not routinely received influenza vaccination 536 (56.7%) responded they would in 2020-21, increasing the vaccination rate in the entire previously eligible cohort from 79.6% to 91.2%, and 466 (68.6%) in the newly eligible.

Multivariable logistic regression resulted in few substantial changes to effect estimates, with the exception of age, for which all estimates showed a stronger association with intention to receive the flu vaccine. In those who became newly eligible to receive the flu vaccine, there was an association between intention to receive the flu vaccine and increased age (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.12), IMD quintile, and considering oneself at high risk from Covid-19 (OR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.70).

Network analysis showed the most frequent themes for previously eligible unvaccinated and newly eligible participants accepting vaccination in 2020/21 were:  precaution for myself (41.2% and 46.1%) and  Covid-19 (27.4% and 27.1%), where the former was qualified by the latter in 36% and 29.1% of responses. Among the previously and newly eligible not intending to receive vaccination in 2020/21, misinformed themes of  makes me unwell,  gives me flu and  vaccine doesnt work were present across 37.4% and 21.9% of responses, respectively.

Among participants with school age children, of those previously eligible who now intend to be vaccinated themselves, 82.5% also intend to vaccinate their children in 2020/21 compared to 25.8% of those who would not accept the influenza vaccine for themselves. Among the newly eligible respondents this was 82.1% and 43.5%, respectively. 49.9% of the previously unvaccinated healthcare workers would continue to decline the vaccine in 2020/21.

InterpretationIn this UK-wide observational study, Covid-19 has increased acceptance of flu vaccination in 2020/21 from 79.6% to 91.2% in those previously eligible, and for the 69% of those newly eligible. This high anticipated vaccination rate (to 26 million (80%) of the UK population) requires appropriate planning, but can be further increased with effective messaging campaigns to address negative misconceptions about flu vaccination, which may also help in preparation for future Covid-19 vaccination. It remains of concern that 50% of healthcare professionals who refused it previously still do not intend to have the flu vaccine.","Bachtiger, P.; Adamson, A.; Chow, J.-J.; Sisodia, R.; Quint, J.

18680,Duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding in faeces as a parameter for wastewater-based epidemiology: Re-analysis of patient data using a shedding dynamics model,"BackgroundWastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is one of the most promising approaches to effectively monitor the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus concentration in faeces and its temporal variations are essential information for WBE. While some clinical studies have reported severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) concentrations in faeces, the value varies amongst patients and changes over time.

AimThe present study aimed to examine how the temporal variations in the concentration of virus in faeces affect the monitoring of disease incidence. We re-analysed the experimental findings of clinical studies to estimate the duration of virus shedding and the faecal virus concentration.

MethodAvailable experimental data as of 23 October, 2020 were collected and patient data reported in Germany were included for further analysis. The viral shedding kinetics was modelled, and the dynamic model was fitted to the collected experimental data by a Bayesian framework. Using samples of posterior distributions, the duration of viral shedding and the concentration of virus copies in faeces over time were computed.

ResultsWe estimated the median concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces as 2.6 (95% Credible Interval (CrI): 0.22-4.8) log copies per gram (g) of faeces over the shedding period, and our model implied that the duration of viral shedding was 23.2 days (95% CrI: 19.5-31.5), given the current standard quantification limit (Ct = 40). With simulated incidences, our results also indicated that a one-week delay between symptom onset and wastewater sampling increased the estimation of incidence by 13.5%.

ConclusionsOur results demonstrated that the temporal variation in virus concentration in faeces affects microbial monitoring systems such as WBE. The present study also implied the need for adjusting the estimates of virus concentration in faeces by incorporating the kinetics of unobserved concentrations. The method used in this study is easily implemented in further simulations; therefore, the results of this study might contribute to enhancing disease surveillance and risk assessments that require quantities of virus to be excreted into the environment.","Miura, F.; Kitajima, M.; Omori, R.",2020-11-23,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.11.22.20236323,1,Fuminari Miura,Ehime University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.22.20236323v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.22.20236323v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144549
7454,Empirical Assessment of COVID-19 Crisis Standards of Care Guidelines,"BackgroundSeveral states have released Crisis Standards of Care (CSC) guidelines for the allocation of scarce critical care resources. Most guidelines rely on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores to maximize lives saved, but states have adopted different stances on whether to maximize long-term outcomes (life-years saved) by accounting for patient comorbidities.

MethodsWe compared 4 representative state guidelines with varying approaches to comorbidities and analyzed how CSC prioritization correlates with clinical outcomes. We included 27 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs at Brigham and Womens Hospital from March 12 to April 3, 2020. We compared prioritization algorithms from New York, which assigns priority based on SOFA alone; Maryland, which uses SOFA plus severe comorbidities; Pennsylvania, which uses SOFA plus major and severe comorbidities; and Colorado, which uses SOFA plus a modified Charlson comorbidity index.

ResultsIn pairwise comparisons across all possible pairs, we found that state guidelines frequently resulted in tie-breakers based on age or lottery: New York 100% of the time (100% resolved by lottery), Pennsylvania 86% of the time (18% by lottery), Maryland 93% of the time (35% by lottery), and Colorado: 32% of the time (10% by lottery). The prioritization algorithm with the strongest correlation with 14-day outcomes was Colorado (rs = -0.483. p = 0.011) followed by Maryland (rs = -0. 394, p =0.042), Pennsylvania (rs = -0.382, p = 0.049), and New York (rs = 0). An alternative model using raw SOFA scores alone was moderately correlated with outcomes (rs = -0.448, p = 0.019).

ConclusionsState guidelines for scarce resource allocation frequently resulted in identical priority scores, requiring tie-breakers based on age or lottery. These findings suggest that state CSC guidelines should be further assessed empirically to understand whether they meet their goals.","Jezmir, J. L.; Bharadwaj, M.; Kishore, S.

24366,Racial/ethnic disparities in sleep in mothers and infants during the Covid-19 pandemic,"Study ObjectivesTo quantify the association between race/ethnicity and maternal and infant self-reported sleep health at 4 months, exploring the role of maternal depression, stress and symptoms of trauma related to the COVID-19 pandemic as potential mediators.

MethodsParticipants were recruited as part of the COVID-19 Mother Baby Outcomes (COMBO) cohort at Columbia University (N=71 non-Hispanic White, N=14 African American (AA), N=113 Hispanic, N=40 other/declined). Data on infant sleep were collected at 4 months postpartum. A subset of 149 women also completed questionnaires assessing maternal mental health and sleep. Multivariable regressions were used to separately estimate associations of race/ethnicity and mental health with multiple sleep domains for infants and mothers adjusting for individual-level covariates.

ResultsCompared to non-Hispanic White, Hispanic infants slept less at night ({beta}=- 101.7{+/-}17.6, p<0.0001) and AA and Hispanic infants went to bed later (respectively {beta} =1.9{+/-}0.6, p<0.0001, {beta}=1.7{+/-}0.3, p<0.0001). Hispanic mothers were less likely to perceive infant sleep as a problem ({beta}=1.0{+/-}0.3, p=0.006). Compared to non-Hispanic White mothers, Hispanic mothers reported worse maternal sleep latency ({beta}=1.2{+/-}0.4, p=0.002), and efficiency ({beta}=0.8{+/-}0.4, p=0.03), but better subjective sleep quality ({beta}=-0.7{+/-}0.4, p=0.05), and less daytime dysfunction ({beta}=-0.8{+/-}0.4, p=0.04). Maternal mental health scores were statistically significant predictors of multiple domains of maternal sleep but did not mediate the association between race/ethnicity and sleep.

ConclusionsRacial/ethnic disparities in maternal and infant sleep are observable at 4 months post-partum.

DesignA pilot randomized controlled trial.

SettingHubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Wuhan, China

PatientsA total of 42 adults with severe COVID-19.

InterventionsParticipants in the CHM plus standard care group received CHM and standard care, and the control group received standard care alone.

Measurements and Main ResultsThe primary outcome was the change in the disease severity category of COVID-19 after treatment at 7 days. Among 42 participants who were randomized (mean [SD] age 60.43 years [12.69 years]; 21 [50%] were aged [&ge;] 65 years; and 35 [83%] women, 42 (100%) had data available for the primary outcome. For the primary outcome, one patient from each group died during treatment; the odds of a shift towards death was lower in the CHM plus group than the standard care alone group (common OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.148 to 2.352 P=.454). Three (2 from the CHM plus group and 1 from the standard care alone group) patients progressed from severe to critical illness. After treatment, mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 disease accounted for 18% (5) vs 14% (2), 71% (20) vs 64% (9), and 0% (0) vs 7% (1) of the patients treated with CHM plus standard care vs. standard care alone.

ConclusionsFor the first time, the G-CHAMPS trial provided valuable information for the national guideline-based CHM treatment for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19.

9741,A discrete-time-evolution model to forecast progress of Covid-19 outbreak,"Based on well-known infection models, we constructed a new model to forecast the propagation of the Covid-19 pandemic which yields a discrete-time evolution with one day interval. The proposed model can be easily implemented with daily updated data sets of the pandemic publicly available by many sources. It has only two adjustable parameters and is able to predict the evolution of the total number of infected people in a country for the next 14 days, if parameters do not change during this time. The model incorporates the main aspects of the disease such as the the fact that there are asymptomatic and symptomatic phases (both capable of propagating the virus), and that these phases take almost two weeks before the infected person status evolves to the next (asymptomatic becomes symptomatic or symptomatic becomes either recovered or dead). One advantage of the model is that it gives directly the number of total infected people in each day (in thousands, tens of thousands or hundred of thousands). The model was tested with data from Brazil, UK and South Korea, it predicts quite well the evolution of the disease and therefore may be a useful tool to estimate the propagation of the disease.","Curado, E.

8293,Seek COVER: Development and validation of a personalized risk calculator for COVID-19 outcomes in an international network,"ObjectiveTo develop and externally validate COVID-19 Estimated Risk (COVER) scores that quantify a patients risk of hospital admission (COVER-H), requiring intensive services (COVER-I), or fatality (COVER-F) in the 30-days following COVID-19 diagnosis.

MethodsWe analyzed a federated network of electronic medical records and administrative claims data from 14 data sources and 6 countries. We developed and validated 3 scores using 6,869,127 patients with a general practice, emergency room, or outpatient visit with diagnosed influenza or flu-like symptoms any time prior to 2020. The scores were validated on patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis across five databases from South Korea, Spain and the United States. Outcomes included i) hospitalization with pneumonia, ii) hospitalization with pneumonia requiring intensive services or death iii) death in the 30 days after index date.

ResultsOverall, 44,507 COVID-19 patients were included for model validation. We identified 7 predictors (history of cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, kidney disease) which combined with age and sex discriminated which patients would experience any of our three outcomes. The models achieved high performance in influenza. When transported to COVID-19 cohorts, the AUC ranges were, COVER-H: 0.69-0.81, COVER-I: 0.73-0.91, and COVER-F: 0.72-0.90. Calibration was overall acceptable.

ConclusionsA 9-predictor model performs well for COVID-19 patients for predicting hospitalization, intensive services and fatality. The models could aid in providing reassurance for low risk patients and shield high risk patients from COVID-19 during de-confinement to reduce the virus impact on morbidity and mortality.","Williams, R.

17343,Effects of New York's Executive Order on Face Mask Use on COVID-19 Infections and Mortality: A Modeling Study,"BackgroundNew York City (NYC) was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. On April 17, 2020, the State of New York implemented an Executive Order that requires all people in New York to wear a face mask or covering in public settings where social distancing cannot be maintained. It is unclear how this Executive Order has affected the spread of COVID-19 in NYC.

MethodsA dynamic compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission among NYC residents was developed to assess the effect of the Executive Order on face mask use on infections and deaths due to COVID-19 in NYC. Data on daily and cumulative COVID-19 infections and deaths were obtained from the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.

ResultsThe Executive Order on face mask use is estimated to avert 99,517 (95% CIs: 72,723-126,312) COVID-19 infections and 7,978 (5,692-10,265) deaths in NYC. If the Executive Order was implemented one week earlier (on April 10), the averted infections and deaths would be 111,475 (81,593-141,356) and 9,017 (6,446-11,589), respectively. If the Executive Order was implemented two weeks earlier (on April 3 when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended face mask use), the averted infections and deaths would be 128,598 (94,373-162,824) and 10,515 (7,540-13,489), respectively.

ConclusionsNew Yorks Executive Order on face mask use is projected to have significantly reduced the spread of COVID-19 in NYC.

The importance of indoor, airborne transmission of COVID-19 is now widely recognized; nevertheless, no quantitative measures have been proposed to protect against it. In this article, we build upon models of airborne disease transmission in order to derive a safety guideline that would impose a precise upper bound on the """"cumulative exposure time"""", the product of the number of occupants and their time in an enclosed space. We demonstrate the manner in which this bound depends on the ventilation rate and dimensions of the room; the breathing rate, respiratory activity and face-mask use of its occupants; and the infectiousness of the respiratory aerosols, a disease-specific parameter that we estimate from available data. Case studies are presented, implications for contact tracing considered, and appropriate caveats enumerated.","Bazant, M. Z.; Bush, J. W.

Objective(1) To quantify SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) in human milk of lactating mothers who received the BNT162b2 vaccine, with reference to a cohort convalescent from antenatal COVID-19, and healthy lactating mothers. (2) To detect and quantify vaccine mRNA in human milk after BNT162b2 vaccination.

DesignGestational Immunity For Transfer 2 (GIFT-2) is a prospective cohort study of lactating mothers who were due to receive two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine, recruited between 5th February 2021 and 9th February 2021.

SettingLactating healthcare workers living in Singapore

ParticipantsConvenience sample of ten lactating healthcare workers. Human milk samples were collected at four time points: pre-vaccination, 1-3 days after dose one, 7-10 days after dose one, and 3-7 days after dose two of the BNT162b2 vaccine.

ExposureTwo doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine 21 days apart.

Main Outcome and Measure(i) SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG in human milk of lactating mothers who received BNT162b2 vaccine, (ii) Detection and quantification of vaccine mRNA in human milk after BNT162b2 vaccination.

ResultsTen lactating healthcare workers aged 32.5 years (range 29 - 42) were recruited, with 40 human milk samples collected and analysed. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA was predominant in human milk of lactating mothers who received BNT162b2 vaccine. The sharpest rise in antibody production was 3 -7 days after dose two of the BNT162b2 vaccine, with medians of 1110 picomolar of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike and 374 picomolar of anti-Receptor Binding Domain IgA. Vaccine mRNA was detected only on rare occasions, at a maximum concentration of 2 ng/mL.

Conclusions and RelevanceIn this cohort of ten lactating mothers following BNT162b2 vaccination, nine (90%) produced SARS-CoV-2 IgA, and ten (100%) produced IgG in human milk with minimal amounts of vaccine mRNA. Lactating individuals should continue breastfeeding in an uninterrupted manner after receiving mRNA vaccination for SARS-CoV-2.

Currently, there are more than 5 million cases worldwide, and the pandemic has increased exponentially in many countries, with different incidences and death rates among regions/ethnicities and, intriguingly, between sexes. In addition to the many factors that can influence these discrepancies, we suggest a biological aspect, the genetic variation at the viral S protein receptor in human cells, ACE2 (angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2), which may contribute to the worse clinical outcome in males and in some regions worldwide. We performed exomics analysis in native and admixed South American populations, and we also conducted in silico genomics databank investigations in populations from other continents. Interestingly, at least ten polymorphisms in coding, noncoding and regulatory sites were found that can shed light on this issue and offer a plausible biological explanation for these epidemiological differences. In conclusion, ACE2 polymorphisms should influence epidemiological discrepancies observed among ancestry and, moreover, between sexes.","Khayat, A. S.; Assumpcao, P. P. D.; Khayat, B. C.

16771,TREATMENT PROFILES AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES OF COVID-19 PATIENTS AT PRIVATE HOSPITAL IN JAKARTA,"BackgroundSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a virus that causes COVID-19, which has become a worldwide pandemic. However, until now, there is no vaccine or specific drug to prevent or treat COVID-19.

ObjectivesTo find out the effective treatment as an antiviral agent for COVID-19, to determine the correlation between sociodemography with clinical outcomes and duration of treatment, and to determine the relationship between comorbidities with clinical outcomes and duration of treatment for COVID-19 patients.

MethodsA prospective cohort study was conducted in this study. This study included only confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the hospital during April-May 2020. Convenience sampling was used to select 103 patients, but only 72 patients were suitable for inclusion.

ResultsThe survival analysis for COVID-19 patients using the Kaplan Meier method showed that patients receiving Oseltamivir + Hydroxychloroquine had an average survival rate of about 83% after undergoing treatment for about ten days. Gender (p = 0.450) and age (p = 0.226) did not have a significant correlation with the duration of treatment for COVID-19 patients. Gender (p = 0.174) and age (p = 0.065) also did not have a significant correlation with clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients. Comorbidities showed a significant correlation with duration of treatment (p = 0.002) and clinical outcome (p = 0.014) of COVID-19 patients.

ConclusionThe most effective antiviral agent in this study based on treatment duration was the combination of Oseltamivir + Hydroxychloroquine. The higher the patients average treatment duration, the lower the average survival rate for COVID-19 patients.","Ramatillah, D.

13798,Ensemble Forecasts of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the U.S.,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has driven demand for forecasts to guide policy and planning. Previous research has suggested that combining forecasts from multiple models into a single """"ensemble"""" forecast can increase the robustness of forecasts. Here we evaluate the real-time application of an open, collaborative ensemble to forecast deaths attributable to COVID-19 in the U.S.

MethodsBeginning on April 13, 2020, we collected and combined one- to four-week ahead forecasts of cumulative deaths for U.S. jurisdictions in standardized, probabilistic formats to generate real-time, publicly available ensemble forecasts. We evaluated the point prediction accuracy and calibration of these forecasts compared to reported deaths.

ResultsAnalysis of 2,512 ensemble forecasts made April 27 to July 20 with outcomes observed in the weeks ending May 23 through July 25, 2020 revealed precise short-term forecasts, with accuracy deteriorating at longer prediction horizons of up to four weeks. At all prediction horizons, the prediction intervals were well calibrated with 92-96% of observations falling within the rounded 95% prediction intervals.

ConclusionsThis analysis demonstrates that real-time, publicly available ensemble forecasts issued in April-July 2020 provided robust short-term predictions of reported COVID-19 deaths in the United States. With the ongoing need for forecasts of impacts and resource needs for the COVID-19 response, the results underscore the importance of combining multiple probabilistic models and assessing forecast skill at different prediction horizons. Careful development, assessment, and communication of ensemble forecasts can provide reliable insight to public health decision makers.","Ray, E. L.; Wattanachit, N.; Niemi, J.; Kanji, A.

4807,"A Randomized, Single-blind, Group sequential, Active-controlled Study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of α-Lipoic acid for critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19)","ObjectTo evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of -Lipoic acid (ALA) for critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

MethodsA randomized, single-blind, group sequential, active-controlled trial was performed at JinYinTan Hospital, Wuhan, China. Between February 2020 and March 2020, 17 patients with critically ill COVID-19 were enrolled in our study. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ALA (1200 mg/d, intravenous infusion) once daily plus standard care or standard care plus equal volume saline infusion (placebo) for 7 days. All patients were monitored within the 7 days therapy and followed up to day 30 after therapy. The primary outcome of this study was the Sequential Organ Failure Estimate (SOFA) score, and the secondary outcome was the all-cause mortality within 30 days.

ResultNine patients were randomized to placebo group and 8 patients were randomized to ALA group. SOFA score was similar at baseline, increased from 4.3 to 6.0 in the placebo group and increased from 3.8 to 4.0 in the ALA group (P=0.36) after 7 days. The 30-day all-cause mortality tended to be lower in the ALA group (3/8, 37.5%) compared to that in the placebo group (7/9, 77.8%, P=0.09).

ConclusionIn our study, ALA use is associated with lower SOFA score increase and lower 30-day all-cause mortality as compared with the placebo group. Although the mortality rate was two-folds higher in placebo group than in ALA group, only borderline statistical difference was evidenced due to the limited patient number. Future studies with larger patient cohort are warranted to validate the role of ALA in critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Zhong, M.; Sun, A.; Xiao, T.; Yao, G.; Sang, L.; Zheng, X.; Zhang, J.; Jin, X.; Xu, L.; Yang, W.; Wang, P.; Hu, K.; Zhang, D.; Ge, J.",2020-04-21,Pharmacology And Therapeutics,10.1101/2020.04.15.20066266,1,Junbo Ge,"Department of Cardiology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University.

5059,"Clinical characteristics of imported and second-generation COVID-19 cases outside Wuhan, China: A multicenter retrospective study","BackgroundThe mortality of COVID-19 differs between countries and regions. By now, reports on COVID-19 are largely focused on first-generation cases. This study aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of imported and second-generation cases.

MethodsThis retrospective, multicenter cohort study included 134 confirmed COVID-19 cases from 9 cities outside Wuhan. Epidemiological, clinical and outcome data were extracted from medical records and were compared between severe and non-severe cases. We further profiled the dynamic laboratory findings of some patients.

Results34.3% of the 134 patients were severe cases, and 11.2% had complications. As of March 7, 2020, 91.8% patients were discharged and one patient (0.7%) died. The median age was 46 years. The median interval from symptom onset to hospital admission was 4.5 (IQR 3-7) days. The median lymphocyte count was 1.1x109/L. Age, lymphocyte count, CRP, ESR, DBIL, LDH, HBDH showed difference between severe and no-severe cases (all P<0.05). Baseline lymphocyte count was higher in the survived patients than in the non-survivor case, and it increased as the condition improved, but declined sharply when death occurred. The IL-6 level displayed a downtrend in survivors, but rose very high in the death case. Pulmonary fibrosis was found on later chest CT images in 51.5% of the pneumonia cases.

ConclusionImported and second-generation cases outside Wuhan had a better prognosis than initial cases in Wuhan. Lymphocyte count and IL-6 level could be used for evaluating prognosis. Pulmonary fibrosis as the sequelae of COVID-19 should be taken into account.

SummaryImported and second-generation cases manifested less complications, lower fatality, and higher discharge rate than initial cases, which may be related to the shorter interval from symptom onset to hospital admission, younger age, and higher lymphocyte count of the imported and second-generation patients. Lymphocyte count and IL-6 level could be used as indicators for evaluating prognosis. Pulmonary fibrosis was found in later chest CT images in more than half of the pneumonia cases and should be taken into account.","Shi, P.; Ren, G.; Yang, J.; Li, Z.; Deng, S.; Li, M.; Wang, S.; Xu, X.; Chen, F.; Li, Y.; Li, C.; Yang, X.; Xie, Z.; Wu, Z.; Chen, M.",2020-04-23,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.19.20071472,1,Mingwei Chen,Xi\'an Jiaotong UNiversity,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.19.20071472v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.19.20071472v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
14813,Network for subclinical prognostication of COVID 19 Patients from data of thoracic roentgenogram: A feasible alternative screening technology,"Background and Study AimCOVID 19 is the terminology driving peoples life in the year 2020 without a supportive globally high mortality rate. Coronavirus lead pandemic is a new found disease with no gold standard diagnostic and therapeutic guideline across the globe. Amidst this scenario our aim is to develop a prediction model that makes mass screening easy on par with reducing strain on hospitals diagnostic facility and doctors alike. For this prediction model, a neural network based on Chest X-ray images has been developed. Alongside the aim is also to generate a case record form that would include prediction model result along with few other subclinical factors for generating disease identification. Once found positive then only it will proceed to RT-PCR for final validation. The objective was to provide a cheap alternative to RT-PCR for mass screening and to reduced burden on diagnostic facility by keeping RT-PCR only for final confirmation.

MethodsDatasets of chest X-ray images gathered from across the globe has been used to test and train the network after proper dataset curing and augmentation.

ResultsThe final neural network-based prediction model showed an accuracy of 81% with sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 90%. The AUC score obtained is 93.7%.

Discussion and ConclusionThe above results based on the existing datasets showcase our model capability to successfully distinguish patients based on Chest X-ray (a non-invasive tool) and along with the designed case record form it can significantly contribute in increasing hospitals monitoring and health care capability.","Bararia, A.; Ghosh, A.; Bose, C.; Bhar, D.",2020-09-09,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.09.07.20189852,1,Debarati Bhar,"R.

7113,Basic Reproduction Rate and Case Fatality Rate of COVID-19: Application of Meta-analysis,"BackgroundThe outbreak of novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has a wider geographical spread than other previous viruses such as Ebola and H1N1. The onset of disease and its transmission and severity has become a global concern. The policymakers have a serious concern for containing the spread and minimising the risk of death.

AimThis study aims to provide the estimates of basic reproduction rate (R0) and case fatality rate (CFR) which applies to a generalised population.

MethodsA systematic review was carried out to retrieve the published estimates of reproduction rate and case fatality rate in peer-reviewed articles from PubMed MEDLINE database with defined inclusion and exclusion criteria in the period 15 December 2019 to 3 May 2020. The systematic review led to the selection of 24 articles for R0 and 17 articles for CFR. These studies used data from China and its provinces, other Asian countries such as Japan, Korea, the Philippines, and countries from other parts of the world such as Nigeria, Iran, Italy, Europe as a whole, France, Latin America, Turkey, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States of America (USA). These selected articles gave an output of 30 counts of R0 and 29 counts of CFR which were used in a meta-analysis. A meta-analysis, with the inverse variance method, fixed- and random-effects model and the Forest plot, was performed to estimate the mean effect size or mean value of basic reproduction rate and case fatality rate. The Funnel plot is used to comprehend the publication bias.

ResultsWe estimated the robust estimate of R0 at 3.11 (2.49-3.71) persons and the robust estimate of CFR at 2.56 (2.06-3.05) per cent after accounting for heterogeneity among studies, using the random-effects model. The regional subgroup analysis in a meta-analysis was significant for R0 but was not significant for CFR. The R0 values varied from 1.90 (1.06-2.74) persons to 3.83 (2.44-5.22) persons across the regions. The Funnel plot confirms that the selected studies are significant at one per cent level of significance.

ConclusionWe found that one person is likely to infect two to three persons in the absence of any control measures, and around three per cent of the population are at the risk of death within one-and-a-half months from the onset of disease COVID-19 in a generalised population. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 varies across regions, but the risk of death remains the same.

ContributionThe estimates of R0 and CFR are independent of data from a particular region or time or a homogeneous population. These estimates are applicable to a generalised population. Therefore, the estimates of R0 and CFR are unequivocally applicable to developing country like India and its states or districts, in ambivalence. The assessments of R0 and CFR values across the developed nations make all of us aware of consequences of COVID-19, and hence these estimates are of crucial importance for government authorities for the practical implementation of strategies and control measures to contain the disease.

O_TEXTBOXResearch Highlights O_LIThe robust estimate of Basic Reproduction Rate (R0) of COVID-19 based on a meta-analysis performed on the pieces of evidence available across countries is 3.11 (2.49-3.71) persons for a generalised population in the absence of any control measures

C_LIO_LIA significant regional variation is evident for the Basic Reproduction Rate (R0) but not for the Case Fatality Rate (CFR)
C_LIO_LIThe peer-reviewed articles with a small sample size do not suffer from publication bias in a meta-analysis of COVID-19.

O_TEXTBOXAdded Value of this StudyOut study combine available evidence of the parameter values, such as reproduction rate and case fatality rate, of the generalised epidemiological models for coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). In this way, we have reduced the dependency on data from a particular region or time or a homogeneous population. By applying meta-analysis, we estimated the robust estimate of reproduction rate and case fatality rate, which is applicable across heterogeneous populations. We proclaim that the reproduction rate of COVID-19 varies across subgroups of populations and regions and periods, but the case fatality rate remained the same. These estimates of reproduction rate and case fatality rate are worthwhile for developing countries like India and at a lower level of geography, in ambivalence.

4242,A Stratified Model to Quantify the Effects of Containment Policies on the Spread of COVID-19,"BackgroundThe SARS-Cov-2 virus is spreading fast all over the world and has already imposed a significant social and economic cost in many countries. Different countries have utilised a variety of containment policies with an emphasis on social distancing as a strategy to stop the spread of COVID-19. Quantifying the effects of such policies in different time-scales and comparing the efficacy of various available policies is of utmost importance for policy-makers in different countries. That is even more important when the policy-makers want to plan for long-term strategies and to weigh each option based on its epidemiological effects and socio-economic costs. In the absence of detailed knowledge of the interactions between individuals in a population and the characteristics of the SARS-Cov-2 virus, quantifying the effects of these policies is very difficult. Hence, there is an immediate need for models that can predict the spread of COVID-19 in a population, without the need for such detailed information.

The MethodIn this manuscript, a method is presented that can be used to predict the spread of COVID-19 in any country and under any containment policy imposed separately on different groups in the population. The method tunes the parameters of a known stratified model based on the available data on the spread of COVID-19. The model includes a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and is easy to simulate and easy to understand. As it is presented in this manuscript, the population is divided into age-groups. But given the availability of the data, there is no reason to limit the stratification into only age-groups and we can consider any relevant groups. To estimate the parameters of the model such that it reflects the characteristics of the spread of COVID-19 in a population, the method relies on an optimisation scheme. More specifically, the optimisation scheme estimates the contact rates between different age groups in the population. But a very important and useful feature of the model is that the estimated parameters for one population can be translated and used for any other population with a known age-structure, which in this day and age, includes almost any country or city in the world. Also, it is shown that the method is quite insensitive to the underlying assumptions in the optimisation scheme and also to deliberate or non-deliberate errors that might have occurred in collecting the data.

ResultsThe capabilities of the model are demonstrated using a case study under different containment policies, from an uncontained population to mitigation and suppression policies. Also, we can use the model to quantify the effects of strategies which include switching between different containment policies at pre-determined points in time. The model allows us to quantify the effects of each of these policies on the spread of the disease in a population, in particular, the instantaneous and total numbers of infectious individuals in a population which are important parameters for policy-makers. The simulation results, as explained in the following, provide some insight into various policies and some of the results are possibly counter-intuitive for many people. For example, the model predicts that closing down schools and universities without any other containment policy imposed on older age-groups has almost no impact on the number of patients that might need support-care in hospitals. The method provides an easy-to-use tool to use the information collected on the spread of COVID-19 in a country or region and then use that information in another population which might not have been as widely affected by the disease yet.","Bokharaie, V.

25067,Improved diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by using Nucleoprotein and Spike protein fragment 2 in quantitative dual ELISA tests,"The novel Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the 2020 worldwide coronavirus pandemic. Antibody testing is useful for diagnosing historic infections of a disease in a population. These tests are also a helpful epidemiological tool for predicting how the virus spreads in a community, relating antibody levels to immunity and for assessing herd immunity. In the present study, SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins were recombinantly produced and used to analyse serum from individuals previously exposed, or not, to SARS-CoV-2. The nucleocapsid (Npro) and Spike subunit 2 (S2Frag) proteins were identified as highly immunogenic, although responses to the former were generally greater. These two proteins were used to develop two quantitative ELISA assays that when used in combination resulted in a highly reliable diagnostic test. Npro and S2Frag-ELISAs could detect at least 10% more true positive COVID-19 cases than the commercially available ARCHITECT test (Abbott). Moreover, our quantitative ELISAs also show that specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 proteins tend to wane rapidly even in patients that had developed severe disease. As antibody tests complement COVID-19 diagnosis and determine population-level surveillance during this pandemic, the alternative diagnostic we present in this study could play a role in controlling the spread of the virus.","De Marco Verissimo, C.; O'brien, C.; Lopez Corrales, J.; Dorey, A.; Cwiklinski, K.; Lalor, R.; Doyle, J.

We have developed a rapid test for screening SARS-CoV-2 neutralization antibodies using genome-free virus-like particles incorporated with a small luciferase peptide, HiBiT. Their entry into LgBiT-expressing target cells reconstitutes NanoLuc luciferase readily detected by a luminometer. This newly developed HiBiT-tagged Virus-like particle-based Neutralization Test (hiVNT) can readily quantify SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies within three hours with a high-throughput in a low biosafety setting. Moreover, the neutralizing activity obtained from hiVNT was highly consistent with that measured by the conventional neutralization test using authentic SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, antibody responses to both viral spike and nucleocapsid proteins correlated with the neutralization activity assessed by hiVNT. Our newly-developed hiVNT could be instrumental to survey individuals for the presence of functional neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2.","Miyakawa, K.; Jeremiah, S.

27479,Individual-based modeling of COVID-19 transmission in college communities,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created major public health and socio-economic challenges across the United States. Among them are challenges to the educational system where college administrators are struggling with the questions of how to reopen in-person activities while prioritizing student safety. To help address this challenge, we developed a flexible computational framework to model the spread and control of COVID-19 on a residential college campus. The modeling framework accounts for heterogeneity in social interactions, activities, disease progression, and control interventions. The relative contribution of classroom, dorm, and social activities to disease transmission was explored. We observed that the dorm has the highest contribution to disease transmission followed by classroom and social activities. Without vaccination, frequent (weekly) random testing coupled with risk reduction measures (e.g. facial mask,) in classroom, dorm, and social activities is the most effective control strategy to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 on college campuses. Moreover, since random screening testing allows for the successful and early detection of both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, it successfully reduces the transmission rate such that the maximum quarantine capacity is far lower than expected to further reduce the economic burden caused from quarantine. With vaccination, herd immunity is estimated to be achievable by 50% to 80% immunity coverage. In the absence of herd immunity, simulations indicate that it is optimal to keep some level of transmission risk reduction measures in classroom, dorm, and social activities, while testing at a lower frequency. Though our quantitative results are likely provisional on our model assumptions, extensive sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of their qualitative nature.

ResultsIndividuals aged >=80 years vaccinated with BNT162b2 prior to 4th January, had a higher odds of testing positive in the first 9 days after vaccination (odds ratio up to 1.48, 95%CI 1.23-1.77), indicating that those initially targeted had a higher underlying risk of infection. Vaccine effectiveness was therefore estimated relative to the baseline post-vaccination period. Vaccine effects were noted from 10-13 days after vaccination, reaching an effectiveness of 70% (95% CI 59-78%) from 28-34 days, then plateauing. From 14 days after the second dose a vaccine effectiveness of 89% (95%CI: 85-93%) was seen.

Individuals aged >=70 years vaccinated from 4th January had a similar underlying risk of COVID-19 to unvaccinated individuals. With BNT162b2, vaccine effectiveness reached 61% (95%CI 51-69%) from 28-34 days after vaccination then plateaued. With the ChAdOx1 vaccine, vaccine effects were seen from 14-20 days after vaccination reaching an effectiveness of 60% (95%CI 41-73%) from 28-34 days and further increasing to 73% (95%CI 27-90%) from day 35 onwards.

On top of the protection against symptomatic disease, cases who had been vaccinated with one dose of BNT162b2 had an additional 43% (95%CI 33-52%) lower risk of emergency hospitalisation and an additional 51% (95%CI 37-62%) lower risk of death. Cases who had been vaccinated with one dose of ChAdOx1 had an additional 37% (95% CI 3-59%) lower risk of emergency hospitalisation. There was insufficient follow-up to assess the effect of ChAdOx1 on mortality due to the later rollout of this vaccine. Combined with the effect against symptomatic disease, this indicates that a single dose of either vaccine is approximately 80% effective at preventing hospitalisation and a single dose of BNT162b2 is 85% effective at preventing death with COVID-19.

ConclusionVaccination with either a single dose of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a significant reduction in symptomatic SARS-CoV2 positive cases in older adults with even greater protection against severe disease. Both vaccines show similar effects. Protection was maintained for the duration of follow-up (>6 weeks). A second dose of BNT162b2 provides further protection against symptomatic disease but second doses of ChAdOx1 have not yet been rolled out in England. There is a clear effect of the vaccines against the UK variant of concern.","Lopez Bernal, J.; Andrews, N.; Gower, C.; Stowe, J.; Robertson, C.; Tessier, E.; Simmons, R.; Cottrell, S.; Robertson, R.; O'doherty, M.; Brown, K.; Cameron, C.; Stockton, D.; Mcmenamin, J.; Ramsay, M.",2021-03-02,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.03.01.21252652,1,Jamie Lopez Bernal,"Public Health England, London, United Kingdom",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.01.21252652v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.01.21252652v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"

3389,The COVID-19 infection in Italy: a statistical study of an abnormally severe disease,"We statistically investigate the Coronavirus Disease 19 (hereinafter Covid-19) epidemics, which is particularly invasive in Italy. We show that the high apparent mortality (or Case Fatality Ratio, CFR) observed in Italy, as compared with other countries, is likely biased by a strong underestimation of infected cases. To give a more realistic estimate of the mortality of Covid-19, we use the most recent estimates of the IFR (Infection Fatality Ratio) of epidemic, based on the minimum observed CFR, and furthermore analyse data obtained from the ship Diamond Princess, a good representation of a  laboratory case-study from an isolated system in which all the people have been tested. From such analyses we derive more realistic estimates of the real extension of the infection, as well as more accurate indicators of how fast the infection propagates. We then point out from the various explanations proposed, the dominant factors causing such an abnormal seriousness of the disease in Italy. Finally, we use the deceased data, the only ones estimated to be reliable enough, to predict the total number of infected people and the interval of time when the infection in Italy could stop.","De Natale, G.; Ricciardi, V.; De Luca, G.; De Natale, D.; Di Meglio, G.; Ferragamo, A.; Marchitelli, V.; Piccolo, A.; Scala, A.; Somma, R.; Spina, E.; Troise, C.",2020-04-10,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.28.20046243,2,Giuseppe De Natale,"Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Naples, Italy & CNR-INO, Pozzuoli (NA), Italy",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046243v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046243v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3390/jcm9051564
22296,COVID-19 in pregnancy: characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women admitted to hospital because of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Nordic countries.,"IntroductionPopulation-based studies about the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) in pregnancy are few and have limited generalizability to the Nordic population and health care systems.

Material and methodThis study examines pregnant women with COVID-19 in the five Nordic countries. Pregnant women were included if they were admitted to hospital between March 1 and June 30, 2020 and had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test 14 days or fewer prior to the admission. Cause of admission was classified as obstetric or COVID-19 related.

ResultsIn the study areas, 214 pregnant women with a positive test were admitted to hospital, of which 56 women needed hospital care due to COVID-19. The rate of admission due to COVID-19 was 0.4 per 1000 deliveries in Denmark, Finland, and Norway and 3.8 per 1000 deliveries in the Swedish regions. Women hospitalized because of COVID-19 were more frequently obese (P < 0.001) and had migrant background (P < 0.001) compared to the total population of women who delivered in 2018. Twelve women (21.4%) needed intensive care. Preterm delivery (n=12, 25%, P < 0.001) and cesarean delivery (n=21, 43,8%, P < 0.001) were more frequent in women with COVID-19 compared to the women who delivered in 2018. No maternal deaths, stillbirths or neonatal deaths were reported.

ConclusionsThe risk of admission due to severe COVID-19 disease in pregnancy was low in the Nordic countries. A fifth of the women required intensive care and we observed higher rates of preterm and cesarean deliveries. National public health policies appear to have had an impact on the rates of admission due to severe COVID-19 disease in pregnancy. Nordic collaboration is important in collecting robust data and assessing rare outcomes.

Key MessageRisk of hospital admission due to COVID-19 infection among pregnant women was low in the Nordic countries, but varied between the countries, which is most likely related to different national public health strategies.","Engjom, H.; Aabakke, A.; Klungsoyr, K.; Svanvik, T.; Ayras, O.; Jonasdottir, E.; Thurn, L.; Petterson, K.; Jones, E.; Kallen, K.; Nyflot, L.

The new virus has spread to at least 316 cities (until 1st February 2020) in China. We used the traffic flow data from Baidu Map, and number of air passengers who left Wuhan from 1st January to 26th January, to quantify the potential infectious people. We developed multiple linear models with local population and air passengers as predicted variables to explain the variance of confirmed cases in every city across China. We found the contribution of air passengers from Wuhan was decreasing gradually, but the effect of local population was increasing, indicating the trend of local transmission. However, the increase of local transmission is slow during the early stage of novel coronavirus, due to the super strict control measures carried out by government agents and communities.","Zhao, X.; Liu, X.; Li, X.",2020-02-11,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.02.07.20021196,1,Xinhai Li,"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021196v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021196v1.full.pdf,cc_by,"NA"
6331,"Who maintains a good mental health in a locked-down country? A French nationwide online survey of 11,391 participants","BackgroundLockdown measures induce massive societal perturbations and can differentially affect mental wellbeing in populations depending on individual determinants. We aim at investigating the sociodemographic and environmental determinants of wellbeing during global lockdown due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

MethodsA nationwide survey was sent online to the French population during the second week of global lockdown during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, between March 25, 2020 and March 30, 2020. Volunteers were recruited on social networks, online newspapers, and mailing lists. We analyzed sociodemographic and environmental variables obtained from a co-built and evidence-based questionnaire. Mental wellbeing was measured by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS).

ResultsWe analyzed data from 11,391 (56.6%) out of 20,235 participants who answered the questionnaire. After weighting data on age and gender distributions, 5415 of the respondents were male (47.5%), 5932 were female (52.1%), and 52 (0.5%) registered as """"other."""" Multivariate analyses indicated that various factors impacted mental wellbeing. Being female (p < .001), a student (p < .001), disabled (p = .001), or having no access to outdoor space (p = 0.02) was associated with lower WEMWBS scores. Conversely, being employed (p < .001) and having more social contacts (p < .01) were both associated with greater mental wellbeing.

InterpretationWe revealed differences in mental wellbeing among the French population at the early stages of global lockdown. Authorities should consider the particular vulnerability of students, persons with disabilities, and those living in constrained housing conditions that could increase the negative impact of lockdown on mental health.","Haesebaert, F.; Haesebaert, J.; Zante, E.; Franck, N.",2020-05-08,Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology,10.1101/2020.05.03.20089755,1,Frederic Haesebaert,CH le Vinatier,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089755v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089755v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.healthplace.2020.102440
25575,Higher COVID-19 Vaccination Rates among Unemployed in the United States: State Level Study in the First 100 days of Vaccine Initiation,"BackgroundSocioeconomic factors may impact the efficiency of COVID vaccine rollout; however, there are limited studies that examine how state socioeconomic status influences the speed of vaccine distribution. This study aimed to demonstrate how employment rates as one of the main socioeconomic factors affect vaccine coverage in 50 states of the United States.

MethodsThis study has obtained vaccine data for the 50 states in the United States, available in the electronic online database ourworldindata.org. In addition to employment rates, other socioeconomic determinants including poverty level, uninsured rates, population density, homeownership, educational level, the percentage of the elderly population, and educational level were obtained from ourworldindata.org data platform. Data from these 50 states were used for regression analyses to examine the relationship between socioeconomic and vaccination rates.

ResultsOur study revealed a positive linear association between unemployment and vaccine rates, and states with higher unemployment rates were more likely to have higher vaccination rates. However, other socioeconomic measures do not significantly associate with vaccine coverage.

ConclusionDespite other studies showing that vulnerable populations had lower vaccine rates, this study shows that states with higher unemployment rates are more likely to be vaccinated. However, the finding suggests a need for more research for the states with higher than 5% unemployment rates, as they had a lower vaccine coverage than states with a range of 4% to 5% unemployment rates.","Roghani, A.; Panahi, S.",2021-04-21,Health Systems And Quality Improvement,10.1101/2021.04.17.21255668,1,Ali Roghani,University of Utah,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.17.21255668v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.17.21255668v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
23328,Geographic disparities in COVID-19 case rates are not reflected in seropositivity rates using a neighborhood survey in Chicago,"To date, COVID-19 case rates are disproportionately higher in Black and Latinx communities across the U.S., leading to more hospitalizations and deaths in those communities. These differences in case rates are evident in comparisons of Chicago neighborhoods with differing race/ethnicities of their residents. Disparities could be due to neighborhoods with more adverse health outcomes associated with poverty and other social determinants of health experiencing higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or due to greater morbidity and mortality resulting from equivalent SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence. We surveyed five pairs of adjacent ZIP codes in Chicago with disparate COVID-19 case rates for highly specific and quantitative serological evidence of any prior infection by SARS-CoV-2 to compare with their disparate COVID-19 case rates. Dried blood spot samples were self-collected at home by internet-recruited participants in summer 2020, shortly after Chicagos first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pairs of neighboring ZIP codes with very different COVID-19 case rates had similar seropositivity rates for anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain IgG antibodies. Overall, these findings of comparable exposure to SARS-CoV-2 across neighborhoods with very disparate COVID-19 case rates are consistent with social determinants of health, and the comorbidities related to them, driving differences in COVID-19 rates across neighborhoods.","Mustanski, B.; Saber, R.; Ryan, D.

2218,"Estimation of local novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in Wuhan, China from off-site reported cases and population flow data from different sources","BackgroundsIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia hit Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and spread to the rest of China and overseas. The emergence of this virus coincided with the Spring Festival Travel Rush in China. It is possible to estimate total number of cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, by 23 January 2020, given the cases reported in other cities and population flow data between cities.

MethodsWe built a model to estimate the total number of cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on the number of cases detected outside Wuhan city in China, with the assumption that if the same screening effort used in other cities applied in Wuhan. We employed population flow data from different sources between Wuhan and other cities/regions by 23 January 2020. The number of total cases was determined by the maximum log likelihood estimation.

FindingsFrom overall cities/regions data, we predicted 1326 (95% CI: 1177, 1484), 1151 (95% CI: 1018, 1292) and 5277 (95% CI: 4732, 5859) as total cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on different source of data from Changjiang Daily newspaper, Tencent, and Baidu. From separate cities/regions data, we estimated 1059 (95% CI: 918, 1209), 5214 (95% CI: 4659, 5808) as total cases in Wuhan in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on different sources of population flow data from Tencent and Baidu.

Initial estimation methods pointed towards case numbers that were much higher than officially reported. In the CoronaSurveys project, we have been addressing this issue using open online surveys with indirect reporting. We compare our estimates with the results of a serology study for Spain, obtaining high correlations (R squared 0.89).

14953,Exhaled CO2 as COVID-19 infection risk proxy for different indoor environments and activities,"CO2 is co-exhaled with aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2 by COVID-19 infected people and can be used as a proxy of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations indoors. Indoor CO2 measurements by low-cost sensors hold promise for mass monitoring of indoor aerosol transmission risk for COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases. We derive analytical expressions of CO2-based risk proxies and apply them to various typical indoor environments. The relative infection risk in a given environment scales with excess CO2 level, and thus keeping CO2 as low as feasible in a space allows optimizing the protection provided by ventilation. We show that the CO2 level corresponding to a given absolute infection risk varies by over 2 orders of magnitude for different environments and activities. Although large uncertainties, mainly from virus exhalation rates, are still associated with infection risk estimates, our study provides more specific and practical recommendations for low-cost CO2-based indoor infection risk monitoring.

Our microsimulation is based on official census data and involves household composition and age distribution as the main population structure variables. Outside household contacts are characterised by an out-reproduction number R* which is the only free parameter of the model. For a subcritical domain we compute the time till extinction and prevalence as a function of the initial number of infected individuals and R*.

We proposed an SEIR(Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) model to analyze the epidemic trend in Wuhan and use the AI model to analyze the epidemic trend in non-Wuhan areas. We found that if the closure was lifted, the outbreak in non-Wuhan areas of mainland China would double in size.

We have used a novel `gene signature-based drug repositioning strategy by applying widely accepted gene ranking algorithms to prioritize the FDA approved or under trial drugs. We mined publically available RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data using CLC Genomics Workbench 20 (QIAGEN) and identified 283 differentially expressed genes (FDR<0.05, log2FC>1) after a meta-analysis of three independent studies which were based on severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in primary human airway epithelial cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that SARS-CoV-2 activated key canonical pathways and gene networks that intricately regulate general anti-viral as well as specific inflammatory pathways. Drug database, extracted from the Metacore and IPA, identified 15 drug targets (with information on COVID-19 pathogenesis) with 46 existing drugs as potential-novel candidates for repurposing for COVID-19 treatment. We found 35 novel drugs that inhibit targets (ALPL, CXCL8, and IL6) already in clinical trials for COVID-19. Also, we found 6 existing drugs against 4 potential anti-COVID-19 targets (CCL20, CSF3, CXCL1, CXCL10) that might have novel anti-COVID-19 indications. Finally, these drug targets were computationally prioritized based on gene ranking algorithms, which revealed CXCL10 as the common and strongest candidate with 2 existing drugs. Furthermore, the list of 283 SARS-CoV-2-associated proteins could be valuable not only as anti-COVID-19 targets but also useful for COVID-19 biomarker development.","Gupta, R.; Nwachuku, E.; Zusman, B.; Jha, R.; Puccio, A.",2021-06-08,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.06.02.21258223,1,Ava Puccio,University of Pittsburgh,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.02.21258223v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.02.21258223v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

ResultsStudy results show that stay-at-home order is quite effective in flattening and then reversing the case growth curve subsiding the pandemic with only 5.8% of the population infected. Whereas, following Floridas current Phase II reopening plan could end the pandemic via herd immunity with 75% people infected. Use of surgical variety face masks reduced infected by 20%.

ConclusionsFor Miami-Dade County, a strategy comprising mandatory use of face masks and aggressive contact tracing to identify 50% of the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic, if adopted now, can potentially steer the COVID-19 pandemic to subside within next 3 months with approximately one fifth of the population infected.","Tatapudi, H.; Das, R.; Das, T.

24338,"A rapid assessment of wastewater for genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants at sewershed scale in Louisville, KY","In this communication, we report on the genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 using wastewater samples in Jefferson County, KY. In February 2021, we analyzed seven wastewater samples for SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance. Variants observed in smaller catchment areas, such as neighborhood manhole locations, were not necessarily consistent when compared to associated variant results in downstream treatment plants, suggesting catchment size or population could impact the ability to detect diversity.","Fuqua, J.; Rouchka, E.; Waigel, S.; Sokoloski, K.; Chung, D.; Zacharias, W.; Zhang, M.; Chariker, J.; Talley, D.; Santisteban, I.; Vasrsani, A.; Moyer, S.; Holm, R.

16175,Impact of pathogen reduction technologies on immunological properties of the COVID-19 convalescent plasma,"Background and ObjectivesCOVID-19 convalescent plasma is an experimental treatment against SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of different pathogen reduction methods on the levels and virus neutralizing activity of the specific antibodies against SARS-CoV2 in convalescent plasma.

Materials and MethodsA total of 140 plasma doses collected by plasmapheresis from COVID-19 convalescent donors were subjected to pathogen reduction by three methods: methylene blue (M)/visible light, riboflavin (R)/UVB, and amotosalen (A)/UVA. To conduct a paired comparison, individual plasma doses were divided into 2 samples that were subjected to one of these methods. The titres of SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibodies (NtAbs) and levels of specific immunoglobulins to RBD, S- and N- proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were measured before and after pathogen reduction.

ResultsThe methods reduced NtAbs titres differently: among units with the initial titre 80 or above, 81% of units remained unchanged and 19% decreased by one step after methylene blue; 60% were unchanged and 40% decreased by one step after amotosalen; after riboflavin 43% were unchanged and 50% (7% respectively) had a one- step (two-step respectively) decrease. Paired two-sample comparisons (M vs A, M vs R and A vs R) revealed that the largest statistically significant decrease in quantity and activity of the specific antibodies resulted from the riboflavin treatment.

ConclusionPathogen reduction with methylene blue or with amotosalen provides the greater likelihood of preserving the immunological properties of the COVID-19 convalescent plasma compared to riboflavin.","Kostin, A.

14113,Phosphate levels and pulmonary damage in COVID-19 patients based on CO-RADS scheme: is there any link between parathyroid gland and COVID-19?,"BackgroundPreliminary studies of COVID-19 have provided some evidence that electrolyte disturbances may also be present in patients. In this study we aimed to evaluate the role of the arrival electrolytes and symptoms in prediction of Lung damage in CT scan based on the CO-RADS system.

MethodsThis was a retrospective cross-sectional analytical study. We included patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection, June 15 to July 7. Patients were included in study if there were no previous history of kidney disease. Demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and CO-RADS High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of lung report were collected. Univariate logistic regression was employed first to identify the effective, correlated items. All statistics were performed with SPSS version 18.0.

ResultsIn the current study, 36 (20 male- 16 female) patients with mean age of the 54.7{+/-}17.5 years old were studied. Most common symptom at the arrival was the Fever (52.8%), followed by Fatigue (18%), and dyspnea (44.4%). Computed tomography assessment revealed CO-RADS 2 in 4 (11.1%) patients, CORADS 3 in 1 (2.8%), CO-RADS 4 in 20 (55.6%), and CO-RADS 5 in 11 (30.6%) patients. In the comparison with the study groups based on the HRCT status (CO-RADS II,III vs. CO-RADS IV,V), patients with severe HRCT damage had significantly lower level of Phosphorus (P < 0.01). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that only one factors was associated with HRCT damage status (Phosphorus, P=0.040). Phosphorus upper than 4.5 was associated with better HRCT results with OR ratio of 3.71 (X2(1)=5.69; p=0.017).

ConclusionOur study illustrates that higher phosphate levels may be associated with better CT scan of lung outcomes in COVID-19; while hypophosphatemia is associated with severe lung injuries. This could help clinicians to manage hospitalized patients and may link the COVID-19 and parathyroid gland.","Javdani, F.; Parsa, S.; Shakeri, H.; Hatami, N.; Kalani, N.; Haghbeen, M.; Raufi, R.; Abbasi, A.; Keshavarz, P.; Hashemi, S.

8038,Worldwide and Regional Forecasting of Coronavirus (Covid-19) Spread using a Deep Learning Model,"In December 2019, Covid-19 epidemic was identified in Wuhan, China. Covid-19 may cause fatality especially among elderly, and people with chronic health problems. After human to human transmissions of the disease, it has rapidly spread throughout China, and then the outbreak has reached to neighboring countries in Asia. Now, the spread of the virus is accelerating in the world, and increasing number of new cases has been reported daily in Europe, Middle East, Africa and America regions. Recently, World Health Organization (WHO) also announced Covid-19 as a Pandemic. As of 3 April, worldwide around more than 1 million cases and around 60,000 fatalities are reported. Thus, forecasting regional and worldwide outbreak size of Covid-19 is important in order to take necessary actions regarding to preparedness plans and mitigation interventions. In this work, we design a deep learning model, which is an effective artificial intelligence method, to provide regional and worldwide forecasts. Particularly for worldwide, our approach predicts the cumulative number of cases, cumulative number of deaths and daily new cases. For Europe and Middle East regions, we predict the cumulative number of cases, and for Mainland China we predict daily new cases and the cumulative number of deaths. We predict the next 10 days based on the previously reported actual time series data of Covid-19. For worldwide forecasts, we use the data provided by Worldometers. For Europe and Middle East forecasts, we use the data provided by World Health Organization, and for China Mainland forecasts, the data is obtained from Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. This is the first time that a deep learning model has been employed for Covid-19 spread prediction, solely based on the known reported cases of Covid-19. The proposed deep learning architecture consists of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layer, dropout layer, and fully connected layers to predict regional and worldwide forecasts. We evaluate our approach with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric. For forecasting, we use the network models that give the minimum RMSE on the last 3 days of actual data. Networks, which achieves the minimum RMSE on the last 3 days, are used to predict the next 10 days. Every day, the spread and situations are changing. Our approach can take into account these realtime changes; the deep learning model can be re-trained with new daily data and perform real-time forecasting. Results show that the proposed deep learning model is promising, it can predict possible scenarios regionally and globally for the spread of Covid-19.","Direkoglu, C.; Sah, M.",2020-05-26,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.05.23.20111039,1,Cem Direkoglu,Middle East Technical University - Northern Cyprus Campus,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.23.20111039v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.23.20111039v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
11080,The UK Covid-19 lockdown weakened in April and May 2020: implications for the size of the epidemic and for outcomes had lockdown been earlier,"The number of active cases in the UK Covid-19 epidemic, the case fatality rate, the susceptible proportion of the population, and how well the lockdown was maintained during April-May 2020 are unknown. These four have a relationship with the shape of the daily mortality curve once one considers the intervals from infection to death or recovery. Without an understanding of this relationship we cannot say that an earlier lockdown would have saved lives. Using a small stochastic model, the lockdown had to be weakened, in April and May, for simulated deaths to match ongoing actual daily deaths. Google mobility data was found to be consistent with the weakening required in the model with similar changes from baseline in time and magnitude. If in an earlier lockdown, mobility and interactions would have followed a similar course, then with a large epidemic curve an earlier lockdown might be associated with many more deaths than some currently believe. This was confirmed in the stochastic model and in two modified SIR models of epidemics of various sizes. The first SIR model had a fixed period to recovery and the second used random periods, both models had random periods to death. Weakening of the mitigations was required to tune the output in large but not in small epidemics. This gives weight to the epidemic having affected many more individuals than some reports currently suggest. In both one and two-week earlier lockdowns, total deaths were found to depend on the size of the epidemic and to vary from 2,000-49,000 deaths. There was a linear relationship between the peak proportion of the population infected and the reciprocal of the case fatality rate. This work questions the low prevalence of < 0.1%, reported by the Office for National Statistics in May and June 2020, since to accommodate a weakening lockdown, the shape of the daily mortality curve, and an acceptable case fatality rate a much larger epidemic curve is required.","Lander, A.

17098,Tocilizumab in nonventilated patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pneumonia is often associated with hyperinflammation. Safety and efficacy of the anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab was evaluated in patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia.

MethodsNonventilated patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia were randomized (2:1) to tocilizumab (8 mg/kg intravenous) or placebo plus standard care. Sites enrolling high-risk and minority populations were emphasized. The primary endpoint was cumulative proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation or who had died by Day 28.

ResultsOf 389 randomized patients, 249 patients received tocilizumab and 128 received placebo in the modified intent-to-treat population (Hispanic/Latino, 56.0%; Black/African American, 14.9%; American Indian/Alaska Native, 12.7%; White, 12.7%; other/unknown, 3.7%). The cumulative proportion (95% confidence interval [CI]) of patients requiring mechanical ventilation or who had died by Day 28 was 12.0% (8.52% to 16.86%) and 19.3 % (13.34% to 27.36%) for the tocilizumab and placebo arms, respectively (log-rank P=0.0360; hazard ratio, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.97]). Median time to clinical failure up to Day 28 favored tocilizumab over placebo (hazard ratio 0.55 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.93]). All-cause mortality by Day 28 was 10.4% with tocilizumab and 8.6% with placebo (weighted difference, 2.0% [95% CI, - 5.2% to 7.8%). In the safety population, serious adverse events occurred in 15.2% of tocilizumab patients (38/250 patients) and 19.7% of placebo patients (25/127).

ConclusionsThis trial demonstrated the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab over placebo in reducing the likelihood of progression to requiring mechanical ventilation or death in nonventilated patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia.

6911,SARS-CoV-2 activates lung epithelia cell proinflammatory signaling and leads to immune dysregulation in COVID-19 patients by single-cell sequencing,"ObjectiveThe outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has become a global health emergency. We aim to decipher SARS-CoV-2 infected cell types, the consequent host immune response and their interplay in the lung of COVID-19 patients.

DesignWe analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of lung samples from 17 subjects (6 severe COVID-19 patients, 3 mild patients who recovered and 8 healthy controls). The expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) was examined among different cell types in the lung. The immune cells infiltration patterns, their gene expression profiles, and the interplay of immune cells and SARS-CoV-2 target cells were further investigated.

ResultsCompared to healthy controls, the overall ACE2 (receptor of SARS-CoV-2) expression was significantly higher in lung epithelial cells of COVID-19 patients, in particular in ciliated cell, club cell and basal cell. Comparative transcriptome analysis of these lung epithelial cells of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection activated pro-inflammatory signaling including interferon pathway and cytokine signaling. Moreover, we identified dysregulation of immune response in patients with COVID-19. In severe COVID-19 patients, significantly higher neutrophil, but lower T and NK cells in lung were observed along with markedly increased cytokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL7, CCL3L1 and CCL4L2) compared with healthy controls as well as mild patients who recovered. The cytotoxic phenotypes were shown in lung T and NK cells of severe patients as evidenced by enhanced O_SCPLOWIFNC_SCPLOW{gamma}, Granulysin, Granzyme B and Perforin expression. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection altered the community interplay of lung epithelial cells and immune cells: the interaction between epithelial cells with macrophage, T and NK cell was stronger, but their interaction with neutrophils was lost in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls.

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 infection activates pro-inflammatory signaling in lung epithelial cells expressing ACE2 and causes dysregulation of immune response to release more pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection breaks the interplay of lung epithelial cells and immune cells.","Chen, H.; Liu, W.; Liu, D.; Zhao, L.; Yu, J.",2020-05-13,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.08.20096024,1,Jun Yu,The Chinese University of Hong Kong,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.08.20096024v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.08.20096024v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
4834,Effectiveness of Intravenous Immunoglobulin for Children with Severe COVID-19: A Rapid Review,"BackgroundIntravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is usually used as supportive therapy, but the treatment of COVID-19 by IVIG is controversial. This rapid review aims to explore the clinical effectiveness and safety of IVIG in the treatment of children with severe COVID-19.

MethodsWe systematically searched the literature on the use of IVIG in patients with COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), including both adults and children. We assessed the risk of bias and quality of evidence and reported the main findings descriptively.

ResultsA total of 1519 articles were identified by initial literature search, and finally six studies, included one randomized controlled trial (RCT), four case series and one case report involving 198 patients. One case series showed the survival of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was not improved by IVIG. One case report showed high-dose IVIG could improve the outcome of COVID-19 adults. Three observational studies showed inconsistent results of the effect of IVIG on SARS patients. One RCT showed that IVIG did not reduce mortality or the incidence of nosocomial infection in adults with severe SARS. The quality of evidence was between low and very low.

ConclusionsThe existing evidence is insufficient to support the efficacy or safety of IVIG in the treatment of COVID-19.","Zhang, J.; Yang, Y.; Yang, N.; Ma, Y.; Zhou, Q.; Li, W.; Wang, X.; Huang, L.; Luo, X.; Fukuoka, T.; Ahn, H.

12102,Safety of Hydroxychloroquine among Outpatient Clinical Trial Participants for COVID-19,"IntroductionUse of hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, especially in combination with azithromycin, has raised safety concerns. Here, we report safety data from three outpatient randomized clinical trials.

MethodsWe conducted three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials investigating hydroxychloroquine as pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis and early treatment for COVID-19. We excluded individuals with contraindications to hydroxychloroquine. We collected side effects and serious adverse events. We report descriptive analyses of our findings.

ResultsWe enrolled 2,795 participants. The median age of research participants was 40 (IQR 34-49) years, and 59% (1633/2767) reported no chronic medical conditions. Overall 2,324 (84%) participants reported side effect data, and 638 (27%) reported at least one medication side effect. Side effects were reported in 29% with daily, 36% with twice weekly, 31% with once weekly hydroxychloroquine compared to 19% with placebo. The most common side effects were upset stomach or nausea (25% with daily, 18% with twice weekly, 16% with weekly, vs. 10% for placebo), followed by diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain (23% for daily, 16% twice weekly, 12% weekly, vs. 6% for placebo). Two individuals were hospitalized for atrial arrhythmias, one on placebo and one on twice weekly hydroxychloroquine. No sudden deaths occurred.

ConclusionData from three outpatient COVID-19 trials demonstrated that gastrointestinal side effects were common but mild with the use of hydroxychloroquine, while serious side effects were rare. No deaths occurred related to hydroxychloroquine. Randomized clinical trials can safely investigate whether hydroxychloroquine is efficacious for COVID-19.

Short SummaryData from three randomized clinical trials using hydroxychloroquine for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 did not suggest significant safety concerns. Gastrointestinal side effects were common but arrhythmias were rare. There were no sudden deaths in any trial.","Lofgren, S. M.; Nicol, M. R.; Bangdiwala, A. S.; Pastick, K. A.; Okafor, E.

19381,Head-to-head comparison of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid test with professional-collected nasal versus nasopharyngeal swab,"BackgroundNasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples for antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) require qualified healthcare professionals and are frequently perceived as uncomfortable by patients.

MethodsWe performed a manufacturer-independent, prospective diagnostic accuracy study, comparing professional-collected nasal mid-turbinate (NMT) to nasopharyngeal swab, using the test kits of a WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT (STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test, SD Biosensor), which is also being distributed by Roche. Individuals with high suspicion for COVID-19 infection were tested. The reference standard was RT-PCR using a combined oro-/nasopharyngeal swab sample. Percent positive and negative agreement, as well as sensitivity and specificity were calculated.

ResultsAmong the 179 participants, 41 (22.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. The positive percent agreement of the two different sampling techniques for the Ag-RDT was 93.5% (CI 79.3-98.2). The negative percent agreement was 95.9% (CI 91.4-98.1). The Ag-RDT with NMT-sampling showed a sensitivity of 80.5% (33/41 PCR positives detected; CI 66.0-89.8) and specificity of 98.6% (CI 94.9-99.6) compared to RT-PCR. The sensitivity with NP-sampling was 73.2% (30/41 PCR positives detected; CI 58.1-84.3) and specificity was 99.3% (CI 96.0-100). In patients with high viral load (>7.0 log10 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/swab), the sensitivity of the Ag-RDT with NMT-sampling was 100% and 94.7% with NP-sampling.

ConclusionThis study demonstrates that sensitivity of a WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT using a professional nasal-sampling kit is at least equal to that of the NP-sampling kit, although confidence intervals overlap. Of note, differences in the IFUs of the test procedures could have contributed to different sensitivities. NMT-sampling can be performed with less training, reduces patient discomfort, and it enables scaling of antigen testing strategies. Additional studies of patient self-sampling should be considered to further facilitate the scaling-up of Ag-RDT testing.","Lindner, A.

5929,"Commercial stocks of SARS-CoV-2 RNA may report low concentration values, leading to artificially increased apparent sensitivity of diagnostic assays","In response to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has rapidly issued 49 emergency use authorizations (EUAs) for SARS-CoV-2 in vitro diagnostic test-kits. A critical metric in the performance evaluation for a diagnostic test kit is the analytical sensitivity, which is measured by the limit of detection (LOD). Commercial RNA stocks with known titers are used to determine LOD. We identified a problem with the titer reported for the commercial stocks when examining the analytical sensitivity of the reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) protocol that is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) using plasmid DNA from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), synthetic RNA from BEI Resources (BEI), and extracted genomic RNA from BEI. We detected 3/3 positives for reactions containing synthetic RNA at a concentration of 0.1 copies/reaction (based on the suppliers label concentration). The apparent better-than-single-molecule performance is a statistically highly unlikely event, indicating a potential inaccuracy in the suppliers quantification of the stock material. Using an ultrasensitive and precise assay, reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR), we independently quantified concentrations of commercial SARS-CoV-2 plasmid DNA and SARS-CoV-2 RNA stocks. For plasmid DNA, the actual concentration measured by RT-dPCR was 11% of the nominal label concentration. For synthetic RNA, the actual concentration measured by RT-dPCR for one lot was 770% of the label concentration and for a different lot was 57% of the label concentration. For genomic RNA, the concentration measured by RT-dPCR for one lot was 240% of the label concentration and for a different lot it was 300% of the label concentration. This SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA from BEI Resources has been used in at least 11 approved FDA Emergency Use Authorizations as of April 27, 2020. Such deviations of reported RNA or DNA stock concentrations from true concentrations can result in inaccurate quantification and calculation of LOD. Precise and accurate reporting of DNA and RNA stock concentrations by commercial suppliers will enable accurate quantification of assay performance, which is urgently needed to improve evaluation of different assays by diagnostic developers and regulatory bodies.","Jue, E.; Ismagilov, R.

27592,Poor antibody response to BioNTech/Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination in SARS-CoV-2 naïve residents of nursing homes,"BackgroundResidents of nursing homes (NH) are at high risk of COVID-19 related morbidity and death and may respond poorly to vaccination because of old age and frequent comorbidities.

MethodsForty residents and forty staff members either naive or previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 were recruited in two NH in Belgium before immunization with two doses of 30{micro}g BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine at day 0 and day 21. Binding antibodies (Ab) to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), spike domains S1 and S2, RBD Ab avidity, and neutralizing Ab against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and B.1.351 variant were assessed at days 0, 21, 28, and 49.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 naive residents had lower Ab responses to BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination than naive staff. These poor responses involved lower levels of IgG to all domains of the vaccine antigen, lower avidity of RBD IgG, and lower levels of Ab neutralizing the vaccine strain. No naive resident had detectable neutralizing Ab to the B.1.351 variant. High and comparable Ab responses were observed in residents and staff previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Clustering analysis revealed that poor vaccine responders not only included naive residents but also naive staff, emphasizing the heterogeneity of responses to mRNA vaccination in the general population.

ConclusionsThe poor Ab responses to mRNA vaccination observed in infection naive residents and in some naive staff members of NH suggest suboptimal protection against breakthrough infection, especially with variants of concern. Adapted vaccination regimens may be needed to provide optimal protection against COVID-19 to vulnerable populations.

SummaryPoor antibody responses to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination were observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection naive residents and some naive staff members of nursing homes. This suggests suboptimal protection against breakthrough infection, especially with variants of concern, and the need for adapted vaccination regimens.","Pannus, P.; Neven, K.

19317,Association between Participation in Government Subsidy Program for Domestic Travel and Symptoms Indicative of COVID-19 Infection,"ImportanceAs countermeasures against the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many countries have introduced or considering financial incentives for people to engage in economic activities such as travel and use restaurants. Japan has implemented a large-scale, nationwide government-funded program that subsidizes up to 50% of all travel expenses since July 2020 with the aim of reviving the travel industry. However, it remains unknown as to how such provision of government subsidies for travel impacted the COVID-19 pandemic.

ObjectiveTo investigate the association between participation in government subsidies for domestic travel in Japan and the incidence of COVID-19 infections.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsUsing the data from a large internet survey conducted between August 25 and September 30, 2020, in Japan, we examined whether individuals who used subsidies experienced a higher likelihood of symptoms indicative of the COVID-19 infection.

ExposureParticipation in the government subsidy program for domestic travel.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresFive symptoms indicative of the COVID-19 infection (high fever, sore throat, cough, headache, and smell and taste disorder) within the past one month of the survey.

ResultsOf the 25,482 respondents (50.3% [12,809] women; mean [SD] age, 48.4 [17.4] years), 3,289 (12.9%) participated in the subsidy program at the time of survey. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that participants in the subsidy program exhibited higher incidence of high fever (adjusted rate, 4.8% for participants vs. 3.7% for non-participants; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.90; 95%CI, 1.42-2.54; p<0.001), sore throat (19.8% vs. 11.3%; aOR, 2.09; 95%CI, 1.37-3.20; p=0.002), cough (19.1% vs. 11.2%; aOR 1.96; 95%CI, 1.27-3.02; p=0.007), headache (29.1% vs. 25.5%; aOR, 1.24; 95%CI, 1.07-1.43; p=0.007), and smell and taste disorder (2.6% vs. 1.8%; aOR 1.98; 95%CI; 1.15-3.40; p=0.01) compared with non-participants.

Conclusion and RelevanceThe participants of government subsidies for domestic travel experienced a higher incidence of symptoms indicative of the COVID-19 infection.","Miyawaki, A.; Tabuchi, T.; Tomata, Y.; Tsugawa, Y.",2020-12-19,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.12.03.20243352,3,Yusuke Tsugawa,UCLA,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.03.20243352v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.03.20243352v3.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049069
2445,Clinical Characteristics of Two Human to Human Transmitted Coronaviruses: Corona Virus Disease 2019 versus Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.,"After the outbreak of the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) worldwide in 2012. Currently, a novel human coronavirus has caused a major disease outbreak, and named corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The emergency of MRES-COV and COVID-19 has caused global panic and threatened health security. Unfortunately, the similarities and differences between the two coronavirus diseases remain to be unknown. The aim of this study, therefore, is to perform a systematic review to compare epidemiological, clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19 and MERS-COV population. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials database to identify potential studies reported COVID-19 or MERS-COV. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory outcomes, the admission rate of intensive cure unit (ICU), discharge rate and fatality rate were evaluated using GraphPad Prism software. Thirty-two studies involving 3770 patients (COVID-19 = 1062, MERS-COV = 2708) were included in this study. The present study revealed that compared with COVID-19 population, MERS-COV population had a higher rate of ICU admission, discharge and fatality and longer incubation time. It pointed out that fever, cough and generalised weakness and myalgia were main clinical manifestations of both COVID-19 and MERS-COV, whereas ARDS was main complication. The most effective drug for MERS-COV is ribavirin and interferon.","Xu, P.; Sun, G.-D.; Li, Z.-Z.",2020-03-10,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.08.20032821,1,Zhi-Zhong Li,The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.08.20032821v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.08.20032821v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
11117,Implementing a Negative Pressure Isolation Space within a Skilled Nursing Facility to Control SARS-CoV-2 Transmission,"BackgroundIsolation space must be expanded during pandemics involving airborne transmission. Little to no work has been done to establish optimal design strategies and implementation plans to ease surge capacity and expand isolation capacity over long periods in congregate living facilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has an airborne transmission component and requires isolation, which is difficult to accomplish in skilled nursing facilities.

PurposeIn this study we designed, implemented, and validated an isolation space at a skilled nursing facility in Lancaster, PA. The overall goal was to minimize disease transmission between residents and staff within the facility.

Basic ProceduresWe created an isolation space by modifying an existing HVAC system of the SNF. We measured pressure on-site and performed computational fluid dynamics and Lagrangian particle-based modeling to test containment and possible transmission extent given the isolation space is considered negative rather than individual rooms.

Main FindingsPressure data shows the isolation space maintained an average hourly value of (standard deviation) -2.3 Pa (0.12 Pa) pressure differential between it and the external hallway connected to the rest of the facility. No transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between residents isolated to the space occurred, nor did any transmission to the staff or other residents occur. The isolation space was successfully implemented and, as of writing, continues to be operational through the pandemic.

HighlightsO_LINegative pressure isolation space is an effective method to meet needed surge capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics

27111,The Humoral Response to the BNT162b2 Vaccine in Hemodialysis Patients,"ImportanceHemodialysis patients have an exceptionally high mortality from COVID-19 and this patient population often has a poor response to vaccinations. Randomized controlled trials for COVID-19 vaccines included few patients with kidney disease, therefore vaccine immunogenicity is uncertain in this population.

ObjectiveEvaluate the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in chronic hemodialysis patients following one versus two doses of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination compared to health care worker controls and convalescent serum.

DesignProspective observational cohort study.

SettingSingle centre study in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Participants142 in-centre hemodialysis patients and 35 health care worker controls.

ExposureBNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresSARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies to the spike protein (anti-spike), receptor binding domain (anti-RBD), and nucleocapsid protein (anti-NP) were measured in 66 hemodialysis patients receiving one vaccine dose following a public health policy change, 76 patients receiving two vaccine doses, and 35 health care workers receiving two vaccine doses.

ResultsDetectable anti-NP suggestive of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in 15/142 (11%) of patients at baseline while only three patients had prior RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19. Two additional patients contracted COVID-19 after receiving two doses of vaccine. In patients receiving a single BNT162b2 dose, seroconversion occurred in 53/66 (80%) for anti-spike and 35/66 (55%) for anti-RBD by 28 days post dose, but only 15/66 (23%) and 4/66 (6%), respectively attained a robust response as defined by reaching the median level of anti-spike and anti-RBD in convalescent serum from COVID-19 survivors. In patients receiving two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine, seroconversion occurred in 69/72 (96%) for anti-spike and 63/72 (88%) for anti-RBD by 2 weeks following the second dose while 52/72 (72%) and 43/76 (41%) reached the median convalescent serum level of anti-spike and anti-RBD, respectively. In contrast, 35/35 (100%) of health care workers exceeded the median level of anti-spike and anti-RBD found in convalescent serum 2-4 weeks after the second dose.

Conclusions and RelevanceThis study confirms poor immunogenicity 28 days following a single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine in the hemodialysis population, supporting adherence to recommended vaccination schedules, and avoiding delay of the second dose in these at-risk individuals.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the serologic response to the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine in hemodialysis patients?

FindingsIn this prospective observational study, humoral response was compared in 66 hemodialysis patients sampled 28 days after receipt of one dose of vaccine to 76 patients who received two doses of vaccine sampled 14 days after the second dose. Among those receiving one dose, 6% had anti-RBD response above the median level of convalescent serum versus 41% who received two doses.

MeaningGiven that hemodialysis patients exhibit a poor humoral response to a single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine, the second dose should not be delayed.","Yau, K.; Abe, K. T.; Naimark, D. M.; Oliver, M.

19229,Identifying US Counties with High Cumulative COVID-19 Burden and Their Characteristics,"Identifying areas with high COVID-19 burden and their characteristics can help improve vaccine distribution and uptake, reduce burdens on health care systems, and allow for better allocation of public health intervention resources. Synthesizing data from various government and nonprofit institutions of 3,142 United States (US) counties as of 12/21/2020, we studied county-level characteristics that are associated with cumulative case and death rates using regression analyses. Our results showed counties that are more rural, counties with more White/non-White segregation, and counties with higher percentages of people of color, in poverty, with no high school diploma, and with medical comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension are associated with higher cumulative COVID-19 case and death rates. We identify the hardest hit counties in US using model-estimated case and death rates, which provide more reliable estimates of cumulative COVID-19 burdens than those using raw observed county-specific rates. Identification of counties with high disease burdens and understanding the characteristics of these counties can help inform policies to improve vaccine distribution, deployment and uptake, prevent overwhelming health care systems, and enhance testing access, personal protection equipment access, and other resource allocation efforts, all of which can help save more lives for vulnerable communities.

17365,Implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on eliminating trachoma as a public health problem,"BackgroundProgress towards elimination of trachoma as a public health problem has been substantial, but the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted community-based control efforts.

MethodsWe use a susceptible-infected model to estimate the impact of delayed distribution of azithromycin treatment on the prevalence of active trachoma.

ResultsWe identify three distinct scenarios for geographic districts depending on whether the basic reproduction number and the treatment-associated reproduction number are above or below a value of one. We find that when the basic reproduction number is below one, no significant delays in disease control will be caused. However, when the basic reproduction number is above one, significant delays can occur. In most districts a year of COVID-related delay can be mitigated by a single extra round of mass drug administration. However, supercritical districts require a new paradigm of infection control because the current strategies will not eliminate disease.

ConclusionIf the pandemic can motivate judicious, community-specific implementation of control strategies, global elimination of trachoma as a public health problem could be accelerated.","Blumberg, S.; Borlase, A.; Prada, J.

To assess the knowledge and practices of Palestinians towards COVID-19 after the ease of movement restrictions, we collected data from Palestinian adults between June 15th and June 30th 2020. The participants pool represented a stratified sample of 1355 adults from Palestinian households across 11 governorates in the West Bank. The questionnaire included 7 demographic questions, 13 questions about participants knowledge and awareness of COVID-19, and 4 questions regarding the participants safety measures that had been taken in the last three months. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that the majority of participants have a good knowledge about COVID-19, but were not adequately committed to the infection control measures necessary to protect themselves and others. The findings may provide valuable feedback to lawmakers and health administrators to prevent the spread of the epidemic.","Qutob, N.; Awartani, F.; Asia, M.; Abu Khader, I.",2020-10-15,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.10.13.20211888,1,Nouar Qutob,arab american university,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.13.20211888v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.13.20211888v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1371/journal.pone.0244925
7535,Differential Effects of Intervention Timing on COVID-19 Spread in the United States,"Assessing the effects of early non-pharmaceutical interventions1-5 on COVID-19 spread in the United States is crucial for understanding and planning future control measures to combat the ongoing pandemic6-10. Here we use county-level observations of reported infections and deaths11, in conjunction with human mobility data12 and a metapopulation transmission model13,14, to quantify changes of disease transmission rates in US counties from March 15, 2020 to May 3, 2020. We find significant reductions of the basic reproductive numbers in major metropolitan areas in association with social distancing and other control measures. Counterfactual simulations indicate that, had these same control measures been implemented just 1-2 weeks earlier, a substantial number of cases and deaths could have been averted. Specifically, nationwide, 56.5% [95% CI: 48.1%-65.9%] of reported infections and 54.0% [95% CI: 43.6%-63.8%] of reported deaths as of May 3, 2020 could have been avoided if the same control measures had been implemented just one week earlier. We also examine the effects of delays in re-implementing social distancing following a relaxation of control measures. A longer response time results in a stronger rebound of infections and death. Our findings underscore the importance of early intervention and aggressive response in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pei, S.; Kandula, S.; Shaman, J.",2020-05-29,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.15.20103655,2,Jeffrey Shaman,Columbia University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.15.20103655v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.15.20103655v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.1126/sciadv.abd6370
11444,COVID-19 severity is predicted by earlier evidence of accelerated aging,"With no known treatments or vaccine, COVID-19 presents a major threat, particularly to older adults, who account for the majority of severe illness and deaths. The age-related susceptibility is partly explained by increased comorbidities including dementia and type II diabetes [1]. While it is unclear why these diseases predispose risk, we hypothesize that increased biological age, rather than chronological age, may be driving disease-related trends in COVID-19 severity with age. To test this hypothesis, we applied our previously validated biological age measure (PhenoAge) [2] composed of chronological age and nine clinical chemistry biomarkers to data of 347,751 participants from a large community cohort in the United Kingdom (UK Biobank), recruited between 2006 and 2010. Other data included disease diagnoses (to 2017), mortality data (to 2020), and the UK national COVID-19 test results (to May 31, 2020) [3]. Accelerated aging 10-14 years prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with test positivity (OR=1.15 per 5-year acceleration, 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.21, p=3.2x10-6) and all-cause mortality with test-confirmed COVID-19 (OR=1.25, per 5-year acceleration, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.44, p=0.002) after adjustment for demographics including current chronological age and pre-existing diseases or conditions. The corresponding areas under the curves were 0.669 and 0.803, respectively. Biological aging, as captured by PhenoAge, is a better predictor of COVID-19 severity than chronological age, and may inform risk stratification initiatives, while also elucidating possible underlying mechanisms, particularly those related to inflammaging.","Kuo, C.-L.; Pilling, L.

9740,Self-reported taste and smell disorders in patients with COVID-19: distinct features in China,"ObjectivesWe aimed to explore the frequencies of nasal symptoms in patients with COVID-19, including loss of smell and taste, as well as their presentation as the first symptom of the disease and their association with the severity of COVID-19.

MethodsIn this retrospective study, 1,206 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included and followed-up by telephone call one month after discharged from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. Demographic data, laboratory values, comorbidities, symptoms, and numerical rating scale scores (0-10) of nasal symptoms were extracted from the hospital medical records, and confirmed or reevaluated by the telephone follow-up.

ResultsFrom COVID-19 patients (N = 1,172) completing follow-up, 199 (17%) subjects had severe COVID-19 and 342 (29.2%) reported nasal symptoms. The most common nasal symptom was loss of taste (20.6%, median score = 6), while 11.4% had loss of smell (median score = 5). The incidence of nasal symptom including loss of smell and loss of taste as the first onset symptom was <1% in COVID-19 patients. Loss of smell or taste scores showed no correlation with the scores of other nasal symptoms. Loss of taste scores, but not loss of smell scores, were significantly increased in severe vs. non-severe COVID-19 patients. Interleukin (IL)-6 and lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) serum levels positively correlated with loss of taste scores. About 80% of COVID-19 patients recovered from smell and taste dysfunction in 2 weeks.

ConclusionIn the Wuhan COVID-19 cohort, only 1 out of 10 hospital admitted patients had loss of smell while 1 out 5 reported loss of taste which was associated to severity of COVID-19. Most patients recovered smell and taste dysfunctions in 2 weeks.","Song, J.; Deng, Y.-K.; Wang, H.; Wang, Z.-C.; Liao, B.; Ma, J.; He, C.; Pan, L.; Liu, Y.; Alobid, I.; Wang, D.-Y.; Zeng, M.; Mullol, J.; Liu, Z.",2020-06-15,Otolaryngology,10.1101/2020.06.12.20128298,1,Zheng Liu,"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.20128298v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.20128298v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1007/s11596-021-2312-7
14249,A Systematic Review of Droplet and Aerosol Generation in Dentistry,"ObjectivesAgainst the COVID-19 pandemic backdrop and potential disease transmission risk by dental procedures that can generate aerosol and droplets, this review aimed to identify which clinical dental procedures do generate droplets and aerosols with subsequent contamination, and for these, characterise their pattern, spread and settle.

Data SourcesSix databases were searched and citation chasing undertaken (to 11/08/20).

Study selectionScreening stages were undertaken in duplicate, independently, by two researchers. Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and verified by another.

ResultsEighty-three studies met the inclusion criteria and covered: Ultrasonic scaling (USS, n=44), highspeed air-rotor (HSAR, n=31); oral surgery (n=11), slow-speed handpiece (n=4); air-water (triple) syringe (n=4), air-polishing (n=4), prophylaxis (n=2) and hand-scaling (n=2). Although no studies investigated respiratory viruses, those on bacteria, blood splatter and aerosol showed activities using powered devices produced the greatest contamination. Contamination was found for all activities, and at the furthest points studied. The operators torso operators arm, and patients body were especially affected. Heterogeneity precluded significant inter-study comparisons but intra-study comparisons allowed construction of a proposed hierarchy of procedure contamination risk: higher risk (USS, HSAR, air-water syringe [air only or air/water together], air polishing, extractions using motorised handpieces); moderate (slow-speed handpieces, prophylaxis with pumice, extractions) and lower (air-water syringe [water only] and hand scaling.

ConclusionSignificant gaps in the evidence, low sensitivity of measures and variable quality limit firm conclusions around contamination for different procedures. However, a hierarchy of contamination from procedures can be proposed for challenge/verification by future research which should consider standardised methodologies to facilitate research synthesis.

Clinical significanceThis manuscript addresses uncertainty around aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) in dentistry. Findings indicate a continuum of procedure-related aerosol generation rather than the current binary AGP or non-AGP perspective. This informs discussion around AGPs and direct future research to help support knowledge and decision making around COVID-19 and dental procedures.","Innes, N.; Johnson, I.; Al-Yaseen, W.; Harris, R.; Jones, R.; Kc, S.; Mcgregor, S.; Robertson, M.; Wade, W.; Gallagher, J.",2020-09-01,Dentistry And Oral Medicine,10.1101/2020.08.28.20183475,1,Nicola Innes,University of Cardiff,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.28.20183475v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.28.20183475v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
15327,Selecting pharmacies for COVID-19 testing to ensure access,"Rapid diagnostic testing for COVID-19 is key to guiding social distancing orders and containing emerging disease clusters by contact tracing and isolation. However, communities throughout the US do not yet have adequate access to tests. Pharmacies are already engaged in testing, but there is capacity to greatly increase coverage. Using a facility location optimization model and willingness-to-travel estimates from US National Household Travel Survey data, we find that if COVID-19 testing became available in all US pharmacies, an estimated 94% of the US population would be willing to travel to obtain a test, if warranted. Whereas the largest chain provides high coverage in densely populated states, like Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Connecticut, independent pharmacies would be required for sufficient coverage in Montana, South Dakota, and Wyoming. If only 1,000 pharmacies in the US are selected to provide testing, judicious selection, using our optimization model, provides estimated access to 29 million more people than selecting pharmacies simply based on population density. COVID-19 testing through pharmacies can improve access across the US. Even if only few pharmacies offer testing, judicious selection of specific sites can simplify logistics and improve access.","Risanger, S.; Singh, B.; Morton, D.; Meyers, L.

14029,Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in the Boston area highlights the role of recurrent importation and superspreading events,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused a severe, ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Massachusetts with 111,070 confirmed cases and 8,433 deaths as of August 1, 2020. To investigate the introduction, spread, and epidemiology of COVID-19 in the Boston area, we sequenced and analyzed 772 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the region, including nearly all confirmed cases within the first week of the epidemic and hundreds of cases from major outbreaks at a conference, a nursing facility, and among homeless shelter guests and staff. The data reveal over 80 introductions into the Boston area, predominantly from elsewhere in the United States and Europe. We studied two superspreading events covered by the data, events that led to very different outcomes because of the timing and populations involved. One produced rapid spread in a vulnerable population but little onward transmission, while the other was a major contributor to sustained community transmission, including outbreaks in homeless populations, and was exported to several other domestic and international sites. The same two events differed significantly in the number of new mutations seen, raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 superspreading might encompass disparate transmission dynamics. Our results highlight the failure of measures to prevent importation into MA early in the outbreak, underscore the role of superspreading in amplifying an outbreak in a major urban area, and lay a foundation for contact tracing informed by genetic data.","Lemieux, J.; Siddle, K.

2430,Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Pneumonia 2019 (COVID-19): An Updated Systematic Review,"OBJECTIVEClinical characteristics of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been described in numerous studies but yielded varying results. We aimed to conduct a systematic review on scientific literatures and to synthesize critical data on clinical traits of COVID-19 from its initial outbreak to pandemic.

METHODSSystematic searches were conducted to identify retrospective observational study that contained clinical characteristics on COVID-19 through multiple databases. Two reviewers independently evaluated eligible publications. Data on clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were extracted and analyzed.

RESULTSSeventy-two retrospective studies demonstrating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were included. A total of 3470 COVID-19 patients were synthesized to the final analysis in an unbiased manner. The most common symptom was fever (2878 [83.0%]), and 63.4% of the patients presented fever as onset symptom. There were 2528 [88.2%] of 2866 cases had abnormal lung findings on chest CT scan. Laboratory findings showed that 1498 [62.8%] of 2387 cases had lymphopenia, and 1354 [64.8%] of 2091 cases had an increased level of C-reactive protein (CRP). A total of 185 [11.5%] patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) while the overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 3.7%. Compared to patients admitted outside of Hubei, China, those from Hubei had a significant higher ICU admission rate (21.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001). Also, CFR attributed to COVID-19 was significantly higher in Hubei than that of non-Hubei admissions (10.4% vs. 0.6%, p<0.001).

INTERPRETATIONThis large patient-based systematic review presents a more precise profiling of the COVID-19 from its outbreak to current pandemic. Dynamic evolvements of COVID-19 are needed to be characterized in future studies.","Fang, Z.; Yi, F.; Wu, K.; Lai, K.; Sun, X.; Zhong, N.; Liu, Z.",2020-03-12,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.07.20032573,2,Zhangfu Fang,State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.07.20032573v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.07.20032573v2.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
19897,"Impact of COVID-19 related unemployment on increased cardiovascular disease in a high-income country: Modeling health loss, cost and equity","BackgroundCardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of health loss and health sector economic burdens in high-income countries. Unemployment is associated with increased risk of CVD, and so there is concern that the economic downturn associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will increase the CVD burden.

AimsThis modeling study aimed to quantify health loss, health cost burden and health inequities among people with CVD due to additional unemployment caused by COVID-19 pandemic-related economic disruption in one high-income country: New Zealand (NZ).

MethodsWe adapted an established and validated multi-state life-table model for CVD in the national NZ population. We modeled indirect effects (ie, higher CVD incidence due to high unemployment rates) for various scenarios of pandemic-related unemployment projections.

ResultsWe estimated the CVD-related heath loss in NZ to range from 23,300 to 36,900 HALYs (health-adjusted life years) for the different unemployment scenarios. Health inequities for M[a]ori (Indigenous population) were 3.7 times greater compared to non-M[a]ori (49.9 vs 13.5 HALYs lost per 1000 people).

Conclusions and policy implicationsUnemployment due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to cause significant health loss and health inequities from CVD in this high-income country. Prevention measures should be considered by governments to reduce this risk, including job creation programs and measures directed towards CVD prevention.","Nghiem, N.; Wilson, N.",2020-12-17,Health Economics,10.1101/2020.12.15.20248284,1,Nhung Nghiem,University of Otago,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.15.20248284v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.15.20248284v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1371/journal.pone.0246053
8156,The Outcome Impact of Early vs Late HFNC Oxygen Therapy in Elderly Patients with COVID-19 and ARDS,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide. High-flow nasal cannula therapy (HFNC) is a major oxygen supporting therapy for severely ill patients, but information regarding the timing of HFNC application is scarce, especially in elderly patients. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 110 elderly patients ([&ge;]65 years) who received HFNC from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Peoples Hospital of Xiantao City and Chinese Medicine Hospital of Shishou City in Hubei Province, China, and from Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Peoples Hospital of Yangjiang City, Peoples Hospital of Maoming City in Guangdong Province, China.

Of the 110 patients, the median age was 71 years (IQR, 68-78) and 59.1% was male. Thirty-eight patients received HFNC when 200 mmHg < PO2/FiO2 [&le;] 300 mmHg (early HFNC group), and 72 patients received HFNC treatment when 100 mmHg < PaO2/FiO2 [&le;] 200 mmHg (late HFNC group). Compared with the late HFNC group, patients in the early HFNC group had a lower likelihood of developing severe ARDS, longer time from illness onset to severe ARDS and shorter duration of viral shedding after illness onset, as well as shorter lengths of ICU and hospital stay. Twenty-four patients died during hospitalization, of whom 22 deaths (30.6%) were in the late HFNC group and 2(5.3%) in the early HFNC group. It is concluded that the Prognosis was better in severely ill elderly patients with COVID-19 receiving early compared to late HFNC. This suggests HFNC could be considered early in this disease process.","Deng, L.; Lei, S.; Jiang, F.; Lubarsky, D. A.; Zhang, L.; Liu, D.; Han, C.; Zhou, D.; Wang, Z.; Sun, X.; Zhang, Y.; Cheung, C.

19917,PTSD symptoms related to COVID-19 as a high risk factor for suicide - Key to prevention,"BackgroundRising rates of suicide, the most dreadful consequence of mental health effects elicited by the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) are cause for grave concern. However, the exact association between mental health problems and suicide remains largely unknown in relation to COVID-19.

MethodsTo determine the impact of COVID-19 on suicide trajectory, we used an interrupted time-series design to analyze monthly suicides rates extracted from Japans national database. We next used mixed-effects regression models to investigate the relationship between the nationwide suicide increase in August 2020 and psychiatric states of 4,348 individuals from an online survey performed immediately before (December 2019) and during (August 2020) the pandemic. Psychiatric states included depression, anxiety, and COVID-19-related PTSD, a form of severe event-related stress.

FindingsIn Japan, suicides had gradually decreased before COVID-19 ({beta} = -0{middle dot}7x10-3, t57 = -14{middle dot}2, p = 8{middle dot}6x10-46), but increased drastically after a state of emergency was declared in April 2020 ({beta} = 0{middle dot}9x10-2, t57 = 17{middle dot}3, p = 2{middle dot}3x10-67). We found that PTSD symptoms reliably predict COVID-19s impact on suicide rates ({beta} = 6{middle dot}3x10-4, t3936 = 5{middle dot}96, p = 2{middle dot}7x10-9). In contrast, depression scores are a reliable indicator of stress vulnerability (i.e. future suicide increases, {beta} = 0{middle dot}001, t3936 = 6{middle dot}6, p = 4{middle dot}5x10-11). Simulations revealed that a one-point reduction in PTSD score could decrease suicides by up to 3{middle dot}1 per ten million people per month in Japan.

InterpretationPTSD symptoms may help to identify high-risk groups so as to increase efficacy of prevention policies.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed on December 2, 2020, for """"COVID"""" and """"suicid*"""" in the titles or abstracts of published articles and obtained 269 hits. No language restrictions were applied to the search. Nearly all previous articles on suicide and COVID-19 have reported simulation studies of suicide counts and rates in case studies, editorials, letters, and commentaries. To date, no study has analyzed the association between psychiatric states and suicide increases in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Added value of this studyTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting a concrete approach to predict suicide rate increases from psychiatric states during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings indicate that PTSD symptoms are a reliable surrogate endpoint of pandemic-related suicide increase.

Implications of all available evidenceThis work provides a new perspective on preparing guidelines for suicide prevention. Efforts should focus on reducing PTSD severity for single individuals and populations to reduce the overall suicide risk.","Chiba, T.; Oka, T.; Hamamura, T.; Kobayashi, N.; Honjo, M.; Miyake, Y.; Kubo, T.; Toda, H.; Hishimoto, A.; Boku, S.; Kanazawa, T.; Kawato, M.; Cortese, A.",2020-12-18,Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology,10.1101/2020.12.15.20246819,1,Toshinori Chiba,Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.15.20246819v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.15.20246819v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
13736,"Use, reuse or discard: quantitatively defined variance in N95 respirator integrity following vaporized hydrogen peroxide decontamination during the COVID-19 pandemic","BackgroundCOVID-19 has stretched the ability of many institutions to supply needed personal protective equipment, especially N95 respirators. N95 decontamination and reuse programs provide one potential solution to this problem. Unfortunately, a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of decontamination on the integrity of various N95 models using a quantitative fit test (QTFT) approach is lacking.

Aims1) To investigate the effects of up to eight rounds of vaporized H2O2 (VHP) decontamination on the integrity of N95 respirators currently in use in a hospital setting. 2) To examine if N95 respirators worn by one user can adapt to the face shape of a second user with no compromise of integrity following VHP decontamination.

MethodsThe PortaCount Pro+ Respirator Fit Tester Model 8038 was used to quantitatively define the integrity, measured by fit, of N95 respirators following decontamination with VHP.

FindingsThere was an observable downward trend in the integrity of Halyard Fluidshield 46727 N95 respirators throughout eight cycles of decontamination with VHP. The integrity of 3M 1870 N95 respirators was significantly reduced after the respirator was worn, decontaminated with VHP, and then quantitatively fit tested on a second user. Furthermore, we uncovered inconsistencies between qualitative fit test and QTFT results that may have strong implications on the fit testing method used by institutions.

ConclusionsOur data revealed variability in the integrity of different N95 models after VHP decontamination and exposed potential limitations of N95 decontamination and reuse programs.","Levine, C.; Grady, C.; Block, T.; Hurley, H.; Russo, R.; Peixoto, B.; Frees, A.; Ruiz, A.; Alland, D.",2020-08-21,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.18.20177071,1,David Alland,Rutgers University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20177071v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20177071v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.jhin.2020.10.007
25320,Modeling non-pharmaceutical interventions in the COVID-19 pandemic with survey-based simulations,"Governments around the globe use non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to curb the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Making decisions under uncertainty, they all face the same temporal paradox: estimating the impact of NPIs before they have been implemented. Due to the limited variance of empirical cases, researcher could so far not disentangle effects of individual NPIs or their impact on different demographic groups. In this paper, we utilize large-scale agent-based simulations in combination with Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) models to investigate the spread of COVID-19 for some of the most affected federal states in Germany. In contrast to other studies, we sample agents from a representative survey. Including more realistic demographic attributes that influence agents behavior yields accurate predictions of COVID-19 transmissions and allows us to investigate counterfactual """"what-if"""" scenarios. Results show that quarantining infected people and exploiting industry-specific home office capacities are the most effective NPIs. Disentangling education-related NPIs reveals that each considered institution (kindergarten, school, university) has rather small effects on its own, yet, that combined openings would result in large increases in COVID-19 cases. Representative survey-characteristics of agents also allow us to estimate NPIs effects on different age groups. For instance, re-opening schools would cause comparatively few infections among the risk-group of people older than 60 years.","Kaffai, M.; Heiberger, R.

14834,The role of NIH funding in vaccine readiness; foundational research and NIH funding underlying candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines,"This work characterizes the NIH contribution to vaccine technologies being employed in """"warp speed"""" development of vaccines for COVID-19, as well as the lack of sustained NIH funding for published research against recognized epidemic threats. Using quantitative methods, we examined the advance of published research on ten of the vaccine technologies incorporated in the 165 candidate vaccines entering development through July 2020 as well as the NIH funding that supported this research. Live, attenuated virus, inactivated virus, and adjuvant technologies have been used in successful products since the 1950s and continue to exhibit steady advance. Synthetic (recombinant) vaccines, viral vectors, DNA, and TLR9 agonists as adjuvants emerged since the 1980s, and exhibit a logistic, """"S-curve"""" pattern of growth characteristic of emerging technologies that have passed an analytically-defined established point. In contrast, mRNA, virus-like particle, and nanoparticle technologies show exponential growth characteristic of technologies short of their established points. The body of research and NIH funding for established and emerging vaccine technologies exhibited sustained growth through the late 2010s, supported by > 16,000 project years of NIH funding totaling over $17.2 billion (2000-2019), the majority through cooperative agreements and intramural programs. NIH funding for published research on vaccines for recognized zoonotic threats including coronavirus, Zika, Ebola, and dengue, however, has been inconsistent and reactive to disease outbreaks. These data are considered in the context of the high failure rate for candidate vaccines and evidence that technological maturity is a significant factor in the efficiency of product development. Sustained funding for both enabling technologies and vaccine development is essential to ensure a rapid response to COVID and future pandemic threats.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThis work examines the advance of research and NIH funding for technologies being employed in """"warp speed"""" development of COVID-19 vaccines in the context of evidence that mature technologies have a greater likelihood of generating successful products. We show that candidate vaccines for COVID-19 employ a variety of established and still-emerging technologies, and identify $17.2 billion in NIH funding for this research from 2000-2019. In contrast, NIH funding for published research for vaccines on recognized pandemic threats has been inconsistent. This work highlights the significance and scale of the NIH contribution to vaccine technologies and the lack of sustained initiatives for vaccine development.","Kiszewski, A. E.; Galkina Cleary, E.

11306,The Immunology of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children with COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2 infection is typically very mild and often asymptomatic in children. A complication is the rare Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19, presenting 4-6 weeks after infection as high fever, organ dysfunction and strongly elevated markers of inflammation. The pathogenesis is unclear but has overlapping features with Kawasaki disease suggestive of vasculitis and a likely autoimmune etiology. We apply systems-level analyses of blood immune cells, cytokines and autoantibodies in healthy children, children with Kawasaki disease enrolled prior to COVID-19, children infected with SARS-CoV-2 and children presenting with MIS-C. We find that the inflammatory response in MIS-C differs from the cytokine storm of severe acute COVID-19, shares several features with Kawasaki disease, but also differs from this condition with respect to T-cell subsets, IL-17A and biomarkers associated with arterial damage. Finally, autoantibody profiling suggests multiple autoantibodies that could be involved in the pathogenesis of MIS-C.

MethodsUsing a simulation-based model of viral transmission we tested the impact of different intervention measures for the control of COVID-19.

ResultsThe use of an antiviral drug, in combination with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, results in a significant decrease of the mean final size and the peak incidence of local outbreaks of COVID-19, provided delays in contact tracing are small.

ConclusionsIntegrating antiviral drugs together with contact tracing and quarantine is predicted through this model to be an effective tool for the control of local outbreaks of COVID-19.","Torneri, A.; Libin, P.

15506,"COVID-19: Risks of Re-emergence, Re-infection, and Control Measures -- A Long Term Modelling Study","In this work we define a modified SEIR model that accounts for the spread of infection during the latent period, infections from asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic infected individuals, potential loss of acquired immunity, people's increasing awareness of social distancing and the use of vaccination as well as non-pharmaceutical interventions like social confinement. We estimate model parameters in three different scenarios - in Italy, where there is a growing number of cases and re-emergence of the epidemic, in India, where there are significant number of cases post confinement period and in Victoria, Australia where a re-emergence has been controlled with severe social confinement program. Our result shows the benefit of long-term confinement of 50% or above population and extensive testing. With respect to loss of acquired immunity, our model suggests higher impact for Italy. We also show that a reasonably effective vaccine with mass vaccination program can be successful in significantly controlling the size of infected population. We show that for India, a reduction in contact rate by 50% compared to a reduction of 10% in the current stage can reduce death from 0.0268% to 0.0141% of population. Similarly, for Italy we show that reducing contact rate by half can reduce a potential peak infection of 15% population to less than 1.5% of population, and potential deaths from 0.48% to 0.04%. With respect to vaccination, we show that even a 75% efficient vaccine administered to 50% population can reduce the peak number of infected populations by nearly 50% in Italy. Similarly, for India, a 0.056% of population would die without vaccination, while 93.75% efficient vaccine given to 30% population would bring this down to 0.036% of population, and 93.75% efficient vaccine given to 70% population would bring this down to 0.034%.","Ghosh, S.

28127,Report on Three Round COVID-19 Risk Blind Tests by Screening Eye-region Manifestations,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected several million people since 2019. Despite various vaccines of COVID-19 protect million people in many countries, the worldwide situations of more the asymptomatic and mutated strain discovered are urging the more sensitive COVID-19 testing in this turnaround time. Unfortunately, it is still nontrivial to develop a new fast COVID-19 screening method with the easier access and lower cost, due to the technical and cost limitations of the current testing methods in the medical resource-poor districts. On the other hand, there are more and more ocular manifestations that have been reported in the COVID-19 patients as growing clinical evidence[1]. This inspired this project. We have conducted the joint clinical research since January 2021 at the ShiJiaZhuang City, Hebei province, China, which approved by the ethics committee of The fifth hospital of ShiJiaZhuang of Hebei Medical University. We undertake several blind tests of COVID-19 patients by Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. Meantime as an important part of the ongoing globally COVID-19 eye test program by AIMOMICS since February 2020, we propose a new fast screening method of analyzing the eye-region images, captured by common CCD and CMOS cameras. This could reliably make a rapid risk screening of COVID-19 with the sustainable stable high performance in different countries and races. For this clinical trial in ShiJiaZhuang, we compare and analyze 1194 eye-region images of 115 patients, including 66 COVID-19 positive patients, 44 rehabilitation patients (nucleic acid changed from positive to negative), 5 liver patients, as well as 117 healthy people. Remarkably, we consistently achieved very high testing results (> 0.94) in terms of both sensitivity and specificity in our blind test of COVID-19 patients. This confirms the viability of the COVID-19 fast screening by the eye-region manifestations. Particularly and impressively, the results have the similar conclusion as the other clinical trials of the globally COVID-19 eye test program[1]. Hopefully, this series of ongoing globally COVID-19 eye test study, and potential rapid solution of fully self-performed COVID risk screening method, can be inspiring and helpful to more researchers in the world soon. Our model for COVID-19 rapid prescreening have the merits of the lower cost, fully self-performed, non-invasive, importantly real-time, and thus enables the continuous health surveillance. We further implement it as the open accessible APIs, and provide public service to the world. Our pilot experiments show that our model is ready to be usable to all kinds of surveillance scenarios, such as infrared temperature measurement device at airports and stations, or directly pushing to the target people groups smartphones as a packaged application.","Fu, Y.; Zhao, L.; Zheng, H.; Sun, Q.; Yang, L.; Li, H.; Xie, J.; Sue, X.; Li, F.; Li, Y.; Yang, W.; Pei, Y.; Wang, J.; Wu, X.; Zheng, Y.; Tian, H.; Gu, M.",2021-06-25,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.06.23.21258626,1,Mengwei Gu,"Aimomics (Shanghai) Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, 200433, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.23.21258626v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.23.21258626v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
8180,Molecular analysis of several in-house rRT-PCR protocols for SARS-CoV-2 detection in the context of genetic variability of the virus in Colombia.,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a public health problem unprecedented in the recent history of humanity. Different in-house real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) methods for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and the appearance of genomes with mutations in primer regions have been reported. Hence, whole-genome data from locally-circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains contribute to the knowledge of its global variability and the development and fine tuning of diagnostic protocols. To describe the genetic variability of Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genomes in hybridization regions of oligonucleotides of the main inhouse methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection, RNA samples with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis were processed through next-generation sequencing. Primers/probes sequences from 13 target regions for SARS-CoV-2 detection suggested by 7 institutions and consolidated by WHO during the early stage of the pandemic were aligned with Muscle tool to assess the genetic variability potentially affecting their performance. Finally, the corresponding codon positions at the 3' end of each primer, the open reading frame inspection was identified for each gene/protein product. Complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained from 30 COVID-19 cases, representative of the current epidemiology in the country. Mismatches between at least one Colombian sequence and five oligonucleotides targeting the RdRP and N genes were observed. The 3 end of 4 primers aligned to the third codon position, showed high risk of nucleotide substitution and potential mismatches at this critical position. Genetic variability was detected in Colombian SARS-CoV-2 sequences in some of the primer/probe regions for in-house rRT-PCR diagnostic tests available at WHO COVID-19 technical guidelines; its impact on the performance and rates of false-negative results should be experimentally evaluated. The genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is highly recommended for the early identification of mutations in critical regions and to issue recommendations on specific diagnostic tests to ensure the coverage of locally-circulating genetic variants.

4975,"Exit strategies: optimising feasible surveillance for detection, elimination and ongoing prevention of COVID-19 community transmission","BackgroundFollowing successful implementation of strong containment measures by the community, Australia is now close to the point of eliminating detectable community transmission of COVID-19. We aimed to develop an efficient, rapid and scalable surveillance strategy for detecting all remaining COVID-19 community transmission through exhaustive identification of every active transmission chain. We also identified measures to enable early detection and effective management of any reintroduction of transmission once containment measures are lifted to ensure strong containment measures do not need to be reinstated.

MethodsWe compared efficiency and sensitivity to detect community transmission chains through testing of: hospital cases; primary care fever and cough patients; or asymptomatic community members, using surveillance evaluation methods and mathematical modelling, varying testing capacities and prevalence of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 fever and cough, and the reproduction number. System requirements for increasing testing to allow exhaustive identification of all transmission chains, and then enable complete follow-up of all cases and contacts within each chain, were assessed per million population.

FindingsAssuming 20% of cases are asymptomatic and all symptomatic COVID-19 cases present to primary care, with high transmission (R=2.2) there are a median of 13 unrecognised community cases (5 infectious) when a transmission chain is identified through hospital surveillance versus 3 unrecognised cases (1 infectious) through primary care surveillance. 3 unrecognised community upstream community cases themselves are estimated to generate a further 22-33 contacts requiring follow-up. The unrecognised community cases rise to 5 if only 50% of symptomatic cases present to primary care. Screening for asymptomatic disease in the community cannot exhaustively identify all transmission under any of the scenarios assessed. The additional capacity required to screen all fever and cough primary care patients would be approximately 2,000 tests/million population per week using 1/16 pooling of samples.

InterpretationScreening all syndromic fever and cough primary care presentations, in combination with exhaustive and meticulous case and contact identification and management, enables appropriate early detection and elimination of community transmission of COVID-19. If testing capacity is limited, interventions such as pooling allow increased case detection, even given reduced test sensitivity. Wider identification and testing of all upstream contacts, (i.e. potential sources of infection for identified cases, and their related transmission chains) is critical, and to be done exhaustively requires more resources than downstream contact tracing. The most important factor in determining the performance of such a surveillance system is community participation in screening and follow up, and as such, appropriate community engagement, messaging and support to encourage presentation and compliance is essential. We provide operational guidance on implementing such a system.

22073,Impact of systemic corticosteroids on hospitalized patients with COVID-19: January 2021 Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated worldwide investigation into a myriad of potential therapeutic agents, including corticosteroids. The first RCT reporting results on the impact of systemic corticosteroids on COVID-19 in a peer reviewed journal was the RECOVERY trial published in July, 2020. The RECOVERY trial showed a reduced risk of 28-day mortality in patients who received oral or intravenous dexamethasone for 10 days.

This study is a meta-analysis of peer reviewed RCTs aims to estimate the association of systemic corticosteroid therapy compared to the usual care or placebo on all-cause mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Software based tools to accelerate the analysis process.

MethodsMeta-analysis of peer reviewed RCTs comparing systemic corticosteroids to usual care or placebo.

ResultsFive English language RCTs were identified, including data from 7645 hospitalized patients worldwide using systemic dexamethasone, hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone in COVID-19 positive patients. Three RCTs were discontinued when preliminary results from the RECOVERY trial became available.

Meta-analysis of all identified RCTs showed no difference in survival in patients who received systemic corticosteroid therapy compared to usual care or placebo (Odds ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.64-1.05, p = 0.09). Subgroup analysis from the 1967 critically ill patients in the identified RCTs showed improved survival in patients who received systemic corticosteroid therapy (Odds ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.51-0.87, p = 0.01).

ConclusionsThis meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed literature by January 1, 2021 showed reduced mortality in critically ill patients but not all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received systemic corticosteroids. The early termination of three of the included RCTs because of the preliminary results of the RECOVERY trial is likely to have dramatically influenced the results of this meta-analysis. Further research is needed to clarify the role of systemic corticosteroid therapy in the management of COVID-19.","Robinson, R.; Prakash, V.; Al Tamimi, R.; Albast, N.; Al-Bast, B.",2021-02-05,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.02.03.21251065,1,Robert Robinson,"Department of Internal Medicine, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL, USA",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.03.21251065v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.03.21251065v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,"NA"

First, we apply an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to a discrete-time stochastic augmented compartmental model to estimate the time-varying effective reproduction number [R]t. We use daily confirmed cases, active cases, recovered cases, deceased cases, Case-Fatality-Rate (CFR), and infectious time as inputs for the model. Furthermore, we define a Transmission Index (TI) as a ratio between the instantaneous and the maximum value of the effective reproduction number. The value of TI shows the disease transmission in a contact between a susceptible and an infectious individual due to current measures such as physical distancing and lock-down relative to a normal condition. Based on the value of TI, we forecast different scenarios to see the effect of relaxing and tightening public measures. Case studies in three countries are provided to show the practicability of our approach.","Hasan, A.; Putri, E.; Susanto, H.; Nuraini, N.",2020-08-02,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.07.30.20165555,1,Agus Hasan,University of Southern Denmark,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.20165555v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.20165555v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.isatra.2021.01.028

6871,Global analysis of daily new COVID-19 cases reveals many static-phase countries including US and UK potentially with unstoppable epidemics,"The COVID-19 epidemics are differentially progressing in different countries. Here, comparative analyses of daily new cases reveal that 61 most affected countries can be classified into four types: downward (22), upward (20), static-phase (12) and uncertain ones (7). In particular, the 12 static-phase countries including US and UK are characterized by largely constant numbers of daily new cases in the past over 14 days. Furthermore, these static-phase countries are overall significantly lower in testing density but higher in the level of positive COVID-19 tests than downward countries. These findings suggest that the testing capacity in static-phase countries is lagging behind the spread of the outbreak, i.e., daily new cases (confirmed) are likely less than daily new infections and the remaining undocumented infections are thus still expanding, resulting in unstoppable epidemics. As such, increasing the testing capacity and/or reducing the COVID-19 transmission are urgently needed to stop the severing crisis in static-phase countries.

20351,Financial Hardship and Social Assistance as Determinants of Mental Health and Food and Housing Insecurity During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States,"BackgroundWhile social assistance through the United States (U.S.) federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided expanded unemployment insurance benefits during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic until the summer of 2020, it is unclear whether subsequent social assistance has been or will be sufficient to meet everyday spending needs and to curb the adverse health-related sequelae of financial hardship.

MethodsThis study estimated recent trends in financial hardship among working-aged Americans with job-related income loss during the pandemic. It also used multivariable logistic regression and repeated cross-sectional individual-level U.S. Household Pulse Survey data on 91,222 working-aged adults between September and December 2020 to explore the associations of financial hardship with mental health outcomes and food and housing insecurity after accounting for receipt of social assistance.

ResultsExperiencing somewhat of a financial hardship (vs no hardship) was linked to 3-7 times higher odds of anxiety and depressive symptoms and a likely eviction, and 11 times higher odds of food insufficiency. Experiencing considerable financial hardship (vs no hardship) predicted 5-7 fold higher odds of anxiety and depressive symptoms, 34-fold higher odds of a likely housing eviction, and 37-fold higher odds of food insufficiency (all P values <.001). Across outcomes, these relationships were stronger at each successively higher level of financial hardship (all P values for linear trend <.001), and more than offset any corresponding benefits from social assistance.

ConclusionsEven after accounting for receipt of social assistance, working-aged adults experiencing financial hardship had markedly greater odds of anxiety and depressive symptoms, food insufficiency, and an anticipated housing eviction. These findings point to the urgent need for direct and sustained cash relief well in excess of current levels of social assistance, and provide a critical baseline assessment for evaluating the impacts of federal public policy responses to economic hardships during the pandemic. It is essential that the U.S. Congress and the new Biden administration provide adequate and needs-based social policy relief measures in order to mitigate the pandemics adverse impacts on the physical, mental, and social well-being of millions of Americans.","Kim, D.",2021-01-25,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.12.24.20248835,2,Daniel Kim,Northeastern University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.24.20248835v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.24.20248835v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
8524,"COVID-19 :Determinants of Hospitalization, ICU and Death among 20,293 reported cases in Portugal","IntroductionDeterminants of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death are still unclear for Covid-19 and only a few studies have adjusted for confounding for different clinical outcomes including all reported cases in a country. We used routine surveillance data from Portugal to identify risk factors for COVID-19 outcomes, in order to support risk stratification, clinical and public health interventions, and scenarios to plan health care resources.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study including 20,293 laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Portugal extracted in April 28 2020, electronically through the National Epidemic Surveillance System of the Directorate-General of Health(DGS). We calculated absolute risks, relative risks (RR) and adjusted relative risks (aRR) to identify demographic and clinical factors associated with hospitalization, admission to ICU and death using Poisson regressions.

ResultsIncreasing age after 60 years was the greatest determinant for all outcomes. Assuming 0-50 years as reference, being aged 80-89 years was the strongest determinant of hospital admission (aRR-5.7), 70-79 years for ICU(aRR-10.4) and > 90 years for death(aRR-226.8) with an aRR of 112.7 in those 70-79. Among comorbidities, Immunodeficiency, cardiac disease, kidney disease, and neurologic disease were independent risk factors for hospitalization (aRR 1.83,1.79,1.56, 1.82), for ICU these were cardiac, Immunodeficiency, kidney and lung disease (aRR 4.33, 2.76, 2.43, 2.04), and for death they were kidney, cardiac and chronic neurological disease (aRR: 2.9, 2.6, 2.0) Male gender was a risk factor for all outcomes. There were small statistically significant differences for the 3 outcomes between regions.

Discussion and ConclusionsOlder age stands out as the strongest risk factor for all outcomes specially for death as absolute is risk was small for those younger than 50. These findings have implications in terms of risk stratified public health measures that should prioritize protecting older people although preventive behavior is needed in all ages. Epidemiologic scenarios and clinical guidelines may consider these estimated risks, even though under-ascertainment of mild and asymptomatic cases should be considered.","Ricoca Peixoto, V.; Vieira, A.; Aguiar, P.; Sousa, P.; Carvalho, C.; Thomas, D.

12369,Healthcare Workers' Mental Health and Wellbeing During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the UK: Contrasting Guidelines with Experiences in Practice,"BackgroundSubstantial evidence has highlighted the importance of considering healthcare workers (HCW) mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and several organisations have issued guidelines with recommendations. However, the definition of wellbeing and the evidence-base behind such guidelines remains unclear.

ObjectivesAssessing the applicability of wellbeing guidelines in practice; identifying unaddressed HCWs needs; and providing recommendations for supporting frontline staff during the current and future pandemics.

Methods and DesignThis paper discusses the findings of a qualitative study based on interviews with frontline healthcare staff in the UK and examines them in relation to a rapid review of wellbeing guidelines developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Results14 guidelines were included in the rapid review and 33 interviews with HCWs were conducted in the qualitative study. As a whole, the guidelines placed greater emphasis on wellbeing at an individual level, while HCWs placed greater emphasis on structural conditions at work, such as understaffing and the invaluable support of the community. This in turn had implications for the focus of wellbeing intervention strategies; staff reported an increased availability of formal mental health support, however, understaffing or clashing schedules prevented them from participating in these activities.

ConclusionHCWs expressed wellbeing needs which align with social-ecological conceptualisations of wellbeing related to quality of life. This approach to wellbeing has been highlighted in literature about HCWs support in previous health emergencies, yet it has not been monitored during this pandemic. Wellbeing guidelines should explore staffs needs and contextual characteristics affecting the implementation of recommendations.","Vera San Juan, N.; Aceituno, D.; Djellouli, N.; Sumray, K.; Regenold, N.; Syversen, A.; Mulcahy Symmons, S.; Dowrick, A.; Mitchinson, L.; Singleton, G.; Vindrola-Padros, C.",2020-07-26,Health Systems And Quality Improvement,10.1101/2020.07.21.20156711,1,Norha Vera San Juan,"Insitute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience.

This study uses various ordinary least squares (OLS) models with a comprehensive set of fixed effects to overcome unobserved heterogeneity issues across counties as well as the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators as dynamic models to address endogeneity issue. Our main results indicate that an increase of one degree in temperature is associated with a reduction of 0.041 cases per 100,000 population at the county-level. We run several robustness tests and all the models confirm the impact of temperature on COVID-19 confirmed new cases. These results help policymakers and economists in optimizing decisions and investments to reduce COVID- 19 new cases.

26756,Comparison of dried blood spots and venous blood for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a population of nursing home residents,"IntroductionIn the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, testing for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies is paramount to monitor immune responses in post-authorization vaccination and sero-epidemiology studies. However, large scale and iterative serological testing by venipuncture in older persons can be challenging. Capillary blood sampled using a finger prick and collected on protein saver cards, i.e., dried blood spots (DBS), has already proven to be a promising alternative. However, elderly persons have a reduced cutaneous microvasculature, which may affect DBS-based antibody testing. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the performance of DBS for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in nursing homes residents.

Materials and methodsWe collected venous blood and paired Whatman and EUROIMMUN DBS from nursing home residents, and from staff as a reference population. Venous blood samples were analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using the Abbot chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA). DBS were analyzed by the EUROIMMUN enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We performed a statistical assessment to optimize the ELISA cut-off value for the DBS using the Youdens J index.

ResultsA total of 273 paired DBS-serum samples were analyzed, of which 129 were positive as assessed by the reference test. The sensitivities and specificities of DBS ranged from 95.0% to 97.1% and from 97.1% to 98.8%, respectively, depending on population (residents or staff) or DBS card type.

It also disrupts metabolic profile due to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines causing a systemic inflammation reaction. However, the development and correlation of dyslipidemia with acute phase reactants is unknown. This investigation was performed to assess the pathological alterations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, and total cholesterol levels in COVID-19 patients.

MethodsThis was a prospective study performed on real-world patients to assess serum levels of LDL-C, HDL, TG, TC on COVID-19 patients (mild: 319; moderate: 391; critical: 357) hospitalized at our center between April 2020 through January 2021. Age- and gender-matched controls who had their lipid profiles in the same period were included as the control group.

ResultsLDL-C, HDL, TG, and TC levels were significantly lower in COVID-19 patients when compared with the control group (P < 0.001, 0.047, 0.045, < 0.001, respectively). All parameters decreased gradually with COVID-19 disease severity (LDL-C: median (IQR), mild: 98 (91,134); moderate: 97 (81,113); critical: 68 (68,83); HDL: mild: 45 (37,50); moderate: 46 (41,50); critical: 40 (37,46); TG: mild: 186 (150,245); moderate: 156 (109,198); critical: 111 (98,154); TC: mild: 224 (212,238); moderate: 212 (203,213); critical: 154 (125,187)). LDL-C, TC, and TG were inversely correlated with acute phase reactants (interleukin-6 (IL-6), Procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and D-dimers). Logistic regression demonstrated lipid profile, thyroid profile, and acute phase reactants as predictors of severity of COVID-19 disease.

ConclusionHypolipidemia develops in increasing frequency with severe COVID-19 disease. It inversely correlates with levels of acute-phase reactants, indicating SARS-COV-2 as the causative agent for alteration in lipid and thyroid levels.","Malik, J.; Ishaq, U.; Laique, T.; Ashraf, A.; Malik, A.; Rathore, M.

9484,An imperfect tool: contact tracing could provide valuable reductions in COVID-19 transmission if good adherence can be achieved and maintained.,"Emerging evidence suggests that contact tracing has had limited success in the UK in reducing the R number across the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate potential pitfalls and areas for improvement by extending an existing branching process contact tracing model, adding diagnostic testing and refining parameter estimates. Our results demonstrate that reporting and adherence are the most important predictors of programme impact but tracing coverage and speed plus diagnostic sensitivity also play an important role. We conclude that well-implemented contact tracing could bring small but potentially important benefits to controlling and preventing outbreaks, providing up to a 15% reduction in R, and reaffirm that contact tracing is not currently appropriate as the sole control measure.","Davis, E.

10175,On Linear Growth in COVID-19 Cases,"We present an elementary model of COVID-19 propagation that makes explicit the connection between testing strategies and rates of transmission and the linear growth in new cases observed in many parts of the world. An essential feature of the model is that it captures the population-level response to the infection statistics information provided by governments and other organisations.

8753,"Covid-19 testing strategies and lockdowns: the European closed curves, analysed by ``skew-normal'' distributions, the forecasts for the UK, Sweden, and the USA, and  the ongoing outbreak in Brazil.","As the number of Covid-19 infections worldwide overtakes 6 millions of Total Confirmed Cases (TCC), the data reveal almost closed outbreaks in many European countries. Using the European data as a basis for our analysis, we study the spreading rate of Covid-19 and model the Daily Confirmed Cases and Deaths per Million (DCCpM and DDpM) curves by using """"skew-normal"""" probability density functions. The use of these asymmetrical distributions allows to get a more realistic prediction of the end of the disease in each country and to evaluate the effectiveness of the local authorities strategies in facing the European outbreak. The initial stage of the Brazilian disease is compared with the early phase of the European one. This is done by using the weekly spreading rate of Covid-19. For Sweden, UK, and USA, we shall give a forecast for the end of pandemic and for Brazil the prediction of the peak of DDpM. We also discuss additional factors that could play an important role in the fight against Covid-19, such as the fast response of the local authorities, the testing strategies, the number of beds in the intensive care units, and, last but not least, the measures of isolation adopted. The Brazilian mitigation measures can be placed between the strict lockdown of many European countries and the Swedish approach, but clearly much comparable to the European ones (in particular to the Netherlands).

MethodsFor Brazil, the weekly spreading rates of Covid-19, as more people are getting infected, was used to compare the outbreak in these countries with the ones of the European countries when they were at the same stage of infection. In the early stage of the disease, normal distributions have been used to obtain what we call a dynamic prediction of the peaks. After reaching the peak of daily infections and/or deaths, skew-normal distributions are required to correctly fit the asymmetrical DCCpM and DDpM curves and get a realistic forecast of the pandemic end.

FindingsThe European data analysis shows that the spreading rate of Covid-19 increased similarly for all countries in its initial stage, but it changed as the number of TCCpM in each country grew. This was caused by the different timely action of the authorities in adopting isolation measures and/or massive testing strategies. The early stage of the outbreak in the USA and Brazil shows for their  factor (DCCpM) a behaviour similar to Italy and Sweden, respectively. For the {beta} factor (DDpM), the American spreading is similar to the one of Switzerland, whereas the Brazilian factor is greater than the ones of Portugal, Germany, and Austria (which showed, in terms of TDpM, the best results in Europe) but, at the moment, it is lower than the other European countries.

InterpretationThe fitting skew parameters used to model the DCCpM and DDpM curves allow a more realistic prediction of the end of the pandemic and give us the possibility to compare the mitigation measures adopted by the local authorities by analysing their respective skew normal parameters (mean, mode, standard deviation, and skewness). In Europe, Sweden and the UK show the greatest asymmetries, a kind of marathon instead of the sprint of other European countries (as observed by Swedish authorities). This also happens for the USA. The Brazilian weekly spreading rate for deaths is lower than most of the European countries at the same stage of the outbreak.

28024,"Modelling, Simulations and Analysis of the First COVID-19 Epidemic in Shanghai","To date, over 178 million people on infected with COVID-19. It causes more 3.8 millions deaths. Based on a previous symptomatic-asymptomatic-recoverer-dead differential equation model (SARDDE) and the clinic data of the first COVID-19 epidemic in Shanghai, this paper determines the parameters of SARDDE. Numerical simulations of SARDDE describe well the outcomes of current symptomatic individuals, recovered symptomatic individuals, and died individuals, respectively. The numerical simulations suggest that both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals cause lesser asymptomatic spread than symptomatic spread; blocking rate of about 95.5% cannot prevent the spread of the COVID19 epidemic in Shanghai. The strict prevention and control strategies implemented by Shanghai government is not only very effective but also completely necessary. The numerical simulations suggest also that using the data from the beginning to the day after about 19 days at the turning point can estimate well the following outcomes of the COVID-19 academic.

2995,"COVID-19 infection induces readily detectable morphological and inflammation-related phenotypic changes in peripheral blood monocytes, the severity of which correlate with patient outcome","BackgroundExcessive monocyte/macrophage activation with the development of a cytokine storm and subsequent acute lung injury, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a feared consequence of infection with COVID-19. The ability to recognize and potentially intervene early in those patients at greatest risk of developing this complication could be of great clinical utility.

MethodsWe performed detailed flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood samples from 28 COVID-19 patients treated at Xian No.8 Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University in early 2020 in an attempt to identify factors that could help predict severity of disease and patient outcome.

FindingsWhile we did not detect significant differences in the number of monocytes between patients with COVID-19 and normal healthy individuals,we did identify significant morphological and functional differences, which are more pronounced in patients requiring prolonged hospitalization and ICU admission. Patients with COVID-19 have larger than normal monocytes, easily identified on forward scatter, side scatter analysis by routine flow cytometry,with the presence of a distinct population of monocytes with high forward scatter (FSC-high). On more detailed analysis, these FSC-high monocytes are CD11b+, CD14+, CD16+, CD68+, CD80+, CD163+, CD206+ and secrete IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha, consistent with an inflammatory phenotype.

ConclusionsThe detection and serial monitoring of this subset of inflammatory monocytes using flow cytometry could be of great help in guiding the prognostication and treatment of patients with COVID-19 and merits further evaluation.","Zhang, D.; Guo, R.; Lei, L.; Liu, H.; Wang, Y.; Wang, Y.; Dai, T.; Zhang, T.; Lai, Y.; Wang, J.; Liu, Z.; He, A.; O'dwyer, M.; Hu, J.",2020-03-26,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.24.20042655,1,Jinsong Hu,Xi\'an Jiaotong University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042655v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042655v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
23362,The emergence and ongoing convergent evolution of the N501Y lineages coincides with a major global shift in the SARS-CoV-2 selective landscape,"The emergence and rapid rise in prevalence of three independent SARS-CoV-2 """"501Y lineages, B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1, in the last three months of 2020 has prompted renewed concerns about the evolutionarily capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to adapt to both rising population immunity, and public health interventions such as vaccines and social distancing. Viruses giving rise to the different 501Y lineages have, presumably under intense natural selection following a shift in host environment, independently acquired multiple unique and convergent mutations. As a consequence all have gained epidemiological and immunological properties that will likely complicate the control of COVID-19. Here, by examining patterns of mutations that arose in SARS-CoV-2 genomes during the pandemic we find evidence of a major change in the selective forces acting on immunologically important SARS-CoV-2 genes (such as N and S) that likely coincided with the emergence of the 501Y lineages. In addition to involving continuing sequence diversification, we find evidence that a significant portion of the ongoing adaptive evolution of the 501Y lineages also involves further convergence between the lineages. Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring how members of these known 501Y lineages, and others still undiscovered, are convergently evolving similar strategies to ensure their persistence in the face of mounting infection and vaccine induced host immune recognition.","Martin, D.

4238,Potency and timing of antiviral therapy as determinants of duration of SARS CoV-2 shedding and intensity of inflammatory response,"Treatments are desperately needed to lower the hospitalization and case fatality rates of SARS CoV-2 infection. In order to meaningfully impact the COVID-19 pandemic, promising antiviral therapies must be identified within the next several months. However, the number of clinical trials that can be performed in this timeframe is limited. We therefore developed a mathematical model which allows projection of all possible therapeutic approaches. Our model recapitulates off-treatment viral dynamics and predicts a three-phase immune response. Addition of treatment with remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, neutralizing antibodies or cellular immunotherapy demonstrates that if in vivo drug potency is high, then rapid elimination of virus is possible. Potent therapies dosed soon after peak viral load when infected people typically develop symptoms, are predicted to decrease shedding duration and intensity of the effector immune response, but to have little effect on viral area under the curve, which is driven by high levels of early SARS CoV-2 replication. Potent therapy dosed prior to peak viral load, when infection is usually pre-symptomatic, is predicted to be the only option to lower viral area under the curve. We also identify that clinically meaningful drug resistance is less likely to emerge with a highly potent agent that is dosed after peak viral load. Our results support an early test and treat approach for COVID-19, but also demonstrate the need to identify early viral shedding kinetic features that are the most predictive surrogates of clinical severity and transmission risk.

11647,Work Related and Personal Predictors of Covid 19 transmission,"The paper provides new evidence from a survey of 2000 individuals in the US and UK related to predictors of Covid-19 transmission. Specifically, it investigates work and personal predictors of transmission experience reported by respondents using regression models to better understand possible transmission pathways and mechanisms in the community. Three themes emerge from the analysis. Firstly, transport roles and travelling practices are significant predictors of infection. Secondly, evidence from the US especially shows union membership, consultation over safety measures and the need to use public transport to get to work are also significant predictors. This is interpreted as evidence of the role of deprivation and of reactive workplace consultations. Thirdly and finally, there is some, often weaker, evidence that income, car-owership, use of a shared kitchen, university degree type, risk-aversion, extraversion and height are predictors of transmission. The comparative nature of the evidence indicates that the less uniformly stringent nature of the US lockdown provides more information about both structural and individual factors that predict transmission. The evidence about height is discussed in the context of the aerosol transmission debate. The paper concludes that both structural and individual factors must be taken into account when predicting transmission or designing effective public health measures and messages to prevent or contain transmission.

4436,Detection of neutralising antibodies to SARS coronavirus 2 to determine population exposure in Scottish blood donors between March and May 2020,"BackgroundThe progression and geographical distribution of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the UK and elsewhere is unknown because typically only symptomatic individuals are diagnosed. We performed a serological study of blood donors in Scotland between the 17th of March and the 18th of May to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as a marker of past infection and epidemic progression.

AimTo determine if sera from blood bank donors can be used to track the emergence and progression of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.

MethodsA pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay was used to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The study group comprised samples from 3,500 blood donors collected in Scotland between the 17th of March and 19th of May, 2020. Controls were collected from 100 donors in Scotland during 2019.

ResultsAll samples collected on the 17th March, 2020 (n=500) were negative in the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 6/500 donors from the 23th-26th of March. The number of samples containing neutralising antibodies did not significantly rise after the 5th-6th April until the end of the study on the 18th of May. We find that infections are concentrated in certain postcodes indicating that outbreaks of infection are extremely localised. In contrast, other areas remain comparatively untouched by the epidemic.

ConclusionThese data indicate that sero-surveys of blood banks can serve as a useful tool for tracking the emergence and progression of an epidemic like the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.","Thompson, C.

Since the outbreak various measures were put in place to contain and control the spread, these interventions were mostly based on compartmental models in epidemiology with the main goal of controlling and monitoring the rate of the basic and effective reproduction number. In this paper, we propose an SEIR model where we incorporate contact tracing and age-structured social mixing. We show the explicit relation between contact tracing and social mixing and other relevant parameters of the proposed model.

In the present study, we analysed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the influent wastewater samples (n = 43) from four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Gandhinagar, India, during August 7th to September 30th, 2020. A total of 40 samples out of 43 were found positive i.e. having at least two genes of SARS-CoV-2. The average Ct values for S, N, and ORF 1ab genes were 32.66, 33.03, and 33.95, respectively. Monthly variation depicted a substantial rise in the average copies of N ([~]120%) and ORF 1ab ([~]38%) genes in the month of September as compared to August, while S-gene copies declined by 58% in September 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 genome concentration was higher in the month of September ([~]924.5 copies/ L) than August ([~]897.5 copies/ L), corresponding to a [~] 2.2-fold rise in the number of confirmed cases during the study period. Further, the percentage change in genome concentration level on a particular date was found in the lead of 1-2 weeks of time with respect to the official confirmed cases registered based on clinical tests on a temporal scale. The results profoundly unravel the potential of WBE surveillance to predict the fluctuation of COVID-19 cases to provide an early warning. Our study explicitly suggests that it is the need of hour that the wastewater surveillance must be included as an integral part of COVID-19 pandemic monitoring which can not only help the water authorities to identify the hotspots within a city but can provide up to 2 weeks of time lead for better tuning the management interventions.

HIGHLIGHTS{square} Study unravels the early warning potential of wastewater based surveillance of COVID-19.
{square}Adequate SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected despite of limited reported case in the vicinity.

8487,COVID 19: An SEIR model predicting disease progression and healthcare outcomes for Pakistan,"BackgroundRecent pandemic of the Noval Coronal Virus (COVID 19) has claimed more than 200,000 lives and about 3.8 million infected worldwide. Countries are being gradually exposed to its devastating threat without being properly prepared and with inadequate response. COVID 19s first two cases were reported in Pakistan on February 26, 2020. We present a model depicting progression of epidemiology curve for Pakistan with and without interventions in view of its health system response capacity in near future.

MethodologyWe used a modified compartmental epidemiological SEIR model to describe the outbreak of COVID-19 in Pakistan including the possibility of asymptomatic infection and presymptomatic transmission. The behavior of the dynamic model is determined by a set of clinical parameters and transmission rate.

ResultsWe estimated that in the absence of a set of proven interventions, the total susceptible population would be 43.24 million, exposed individuals would be almost 32 million, asymptomatic cases would be 13.13 million, mildly infected 30.64 million, severely infected slightly more than 6 million and critical cases would be around 967,000 in number. By that time, almost 760,000 fatalities of infected critical would have taken place. Comparing with the healthcare capacity of Pakistan, if we could """"flatten the curve"""" to a level below the dashed grey line, the healthcare system will be capable of managing the cases with ideal healthcare facilities, where the grey line representing the healthcare capacity of Pakistan. With the intervention in place, the number of symptomatic infected individuals is expected to be almost 20 million.

ConclusionWe consider the impact of intervention and control measures on the spread of COVID-19 with 30% reduction in transmission from mild cases in case a set of interventions are judiciously in place to mitigate its impact.","Khan, E.

23153,Clinical course and outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients in two successive pandemic waves,"RationaleThe progress of COVID-19 from moderate to severe may be precipitous, while the heterogenous characteristics of the disease pose challenges to the management of these patients.

ObjectivesTo characterize the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 during two successive waves.

MethodsWe leveraged the multi-center SuPAR in Adult Patients With COVID-19 (SPARCOL) study and collected data from consecutive patients requiring admission to the intensive care unit from April 1st to December 31st, 2020.

Measurements and Main ResultsOf 252 patients, 81 (32%) required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Of them, 17 (20.9%) were intubated during the first wave, while 64 (79%) during the second wave. The most prominent difference between the two waves was the overall survival (first wave 58.9% vs. second wave 15.6%, adjusted p-value=0.006). This difference is reflected in the prolonged hospitalization during the first wave. The mean ICU length of stay (19.1 vs. 11.7 days, p=0.022), hospital length of stay (28.5 vs. 17.1 days, p=0.012), and days on ventilator (16.7 vs. 11.5, p=0.13) were higher during the first wave. A significant difference between the two waves was the development of bradycardia. In the first wave, 2 (11.7%) patients developed sinus bradycardia only after admission to the intensive care unit, while in the second wave, 63 (98.4%) patients developed sinus bradycardia during hospitalization.

ConclusionsSurvival of critically ill patients with COVID-19 was significantly lower during the second wave. The majority of these patients developed sinus bradycardia during hospitalization.","Chalkias, A.; Pantazopoulos, I.; Papagiannakis, N.; Skoulakis, A.; Laou, E.; Kolonia, K.; Ntalarizou, N.; Ragias, D.; Kampolis, C.; Garcia De Guadiana Romualdo, L.; Tourlakopoulos, K.; Pagonis, A.; Hayek, S.

Here we report longitudinal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses pre- and post-vaccination among a cohort of healthcare personnel, with and without prior infection, from a large academic medical center. Our results provide preliminary evidence that prior SARS-CoV-2 infection may prime the response to the first mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose. These findings could have significant impact on the allocation of mRNA-based vaccines and support the need for future research into the effect of prior infection on magnitude and durability of vaccination response.","Ciccone, E.

7898,Geographical surveillance of COVID-19: Diagnosed cases and death in the United States,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is a new coronavirus that has spread from person to person throughout the world. Geographical disease surveillance is a powerful tool to monitor the spread of epidemics and pandemic, providing important information on the location of new hot-spots, assisting public health agencies to implement targeted approaches to minimize mortality.

MethodsCounty level data from January 22-April 28 was downloaded from USAfacts.org to create heat maps with ArcMap for diagnosed COVID-19 cases and mortality. The data was analyzed using spatial and space-time scan statistics and the SaTScan software, to detect geographical cluster with high incidence and mortality, adjusting for multiple testing. Analyses were adjusted for age. While the spatial clusters represent counties with unusually high counts of COVID-19 when averaged over the time period January 22-April 20, the space-time clusters allow us to identify groups of counties in which there exists a significant change over time.

ResultsThere were several statistically significant COVID-19 clusters for both incidence and mortality. Top clusters with high rates included the areas in and around New York City, New Orleans and Chicago, but there were also several small rural clusters. Top clusters for a recent surge in incidence and mortality included large parts of the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic Region, and several smaller areas in and around New York and New England.

ConclusionsSpatial and space-time surveillance of COVID-19 can be useful for public health departments in their efforts to minimize mortality from the disease. It can also be applied to smaller regions with more granular data.","Amin, R.; Hall, T.; Church, J.; Schlierf, D.; Kulldorff, M.",2020-05-25,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.22.20110155,1,Raid Amin,University of West Florida,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.20110155v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.20110155v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
15566,Efficacy and Safety of Guduchi Ghan Vati in the Management of Asymptomatic COVID-19 infection: An Open Label Feasibility Study,"BackgroundGuduchi Ghan Vati (aqueous extract of Tinospora cordifolia) is an essential herbal plant in Indian traditional medicine (Ayurveda) that is well documented as an immunomodulator and antimicrobial agent. A recent in silico study found the therapeutic efficacy of Guduchi against SARS-CoV-2. Based on available evidence, we conducted a feasibility study of the safety and efficacy of Guduchi Ghan Vati in asymptomatic patients with covid-19.

Patients and methodsAn open label, feasibility trial was conducted on 46 patients in the hospital setting. A single-arm study with no control group and blinding was executed in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India. All patients orally received 2 tablets (1000 mg) twice daily for 2 weeks. Clinical parameters were collected at baseline, day 3, day 7 and day 14. Patients were continuously monitored for side effects and adverse reactions during the study period..

ResultsOut of 46 asymptomatic patients included in the study, 40 completed the 14-day follow-up period. None developed any Covid-19 symptoms after admission to the hospital. On day 3 post-treatment, viral clearance was reported in 16 (32.5%) patients. By the end of D-7, 38 (95%) patients had viral load disappearance. Follow-up at D-14 showed that all participants tested negative.

ConclusionIn adult patients with asymptomatic Covid-19, Gudhuchi Ghan Vati could be effective. Randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes in patients with Covid-19 are urgently needed to confirm the definite benefit with Ayurveda.","Kumar, A.; Prasad, G.; Srivastav, S.; Gautam, V.

5218,Excess deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic: An international comparison,"BackgroundWith the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) there has been disruption to normal clinical activity in response to the increased demand on health services. There are reports of a reduction in non-Covid-19 emergency presentations. Consequentially, there are concerns that deaths from non-Covid-19 causes could increase. We examined recent reported population-based mortality rates, compared with expected rates, and compared any excess in deaths with the number of deaths attributed to Covid-19.

MethodsNational agency and death registration reports were searched for numbers of deaths attributed to Covid-19 and overall mortality that had been publicly reported by 06 May 2020. Data on the number of deaths attributed to Covid-19, the total number of deaths registered in the population and the historical average over at least 3 years were collected. Data were available for 4 European countries (England & Wales, Scotland, Netherlands and Italy) and New York State, United States of America.

ResultsThere was an increase in observed, compared with expected, mortality in Scotland (+68%), England and Wales (+74%), the Netherlands (+58%), Italy (+39%) and New York state (+49%). Of these deaths, only 73% in Scotland, 71 % in England and Wales, 53% in the Netherlands, 54% in Italy and 79% in New York state were attributed to Covid-19 leaving a number of excess deaths not attributed to Covid-19. In the 5-week period of study, Scotland, 10% of the excess of deaths were attributed to dementia/Alzheimers disease and 7% to cardiovascular causes.

ConclusionA substantial proportion of excess deaths observed during the current COVID-19 pandemic are not attributed to COVID-19 and may represent unrecognised deaths due to Covid-19, an excess of deaths due to other causes, or both. The impact of Covid-19 on mortality and morbidity from other causes needs to be quantified and addressed in public health planning.","Docherty, K.; Butt, J.; De Boer, R.; Dewan, P.; Koeber, L.; Maggioni, A.; Mcmurray, J.; Solomon, S.; Jhund, P.

25276,Association between comorbidities and death from COVID-19 in different age groups,"BackgroundThis new COVID-19 pandemic challenges health systems around the world; therefore, it is extremely important to determine which patients with COVID-19 can evolve to more severe outcomes. Accordingly, we decided to assess the role that comorbidities play in death from COVID-19.

MethodsTwo age groups (<60 and [&ge;] 60 years) were defined for analysis. Decision trees were made to identify which comorbidities had the highest fatality rate (FR). Multiple logistic regressions were performed to measure the association between comorbidities and death.

ResultsA significant difference was found between the FR of <60 group and [&ge;] 60 group. The most frequent comorbidity were cardiac diseases and diabetes. The combination of comorbidities with the highest FR was diabetes with kidney disease. Combinations of more than two comorbidities presented higher FR. The comorbidities had higher Odd ratios in the younger group than in the older group.

ConclusionsComorbidities seem to play a greater role in death from COVID-19 in the younger group, while in the> 60 group; age seems to be the most important factor. We assigned a score to the comorbidities and their combinations for both age groups to help the health personnel make decisions.","Fleitas, P. E.; Almazan, M. C.; Cortez, S. D.; Paz, J.

19874,The role of metabolic comorbidity in COVID-19 mortality of middle-aged adults. The case of Mexico.,"BackgroundIn contrast to developed countries, in Mexico more than half of COVID-19 deaths have occurred in adults <65-years-old, with at least a million years of life lost to premature mortality (YLL) in eight months. Mexico has a young population but a high prevalence of metabolic diseases like obesity and diabetes that contribute to COVID-19 adverse outcomes. COVID-19 could be particularly risky in population with specific comorbidity combinations that havent been analyzed.

MethodsTo explore what contributes to the high COVID-19 mortality in Mexican middle-aged adults, we calculated age-stratified COVID-19 case fatality rates, YLL and relative risk (RR) of 9 comorbidities and 23 comorbidity combinations in a retrospective Mexican cohort with 905,579 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases/89,167 deaths, until Nov/2/2020.

FindingsChronic kidney disease (CKD) had the highest RR for COVID-19 fatality, followed by diabetes and immunosuppression, that in turn had higher RR than obesity or hypertension as single comorbidities. The combination diabetes/hypertension with or without obesity had RR as high as CKD as a single comorbidity (>3 in <60-year-olds). Notably, the RR of comorbidities decreased with age, tending to values near 1 after age 60; suggesting that in Mexico, comorbidities increase COVID-19 fatality mostly in young and middle-aged adults. Our analysis suggests that advanced metabolic disease, marked by multimorbidity (more than one chronic disease per individual) or diabetes before age 60, contribute particularly to the younger age of COVID-19 fatalities in Mexico. Around 38% of YLL to COVID-19, were attributable to the synergy between COVID-19 and pre-existing diseases, mainly combinations between obesity, diabetes and hypertension. Yet, [1/4] of deaths and 1/3 of YLL have occurred in individuals without known comorbidities.

ConclusionsThe Mexican COVID-19 outbreak illustrates that middle-aged adults 45-64-yo can have high COVID-19 mortality during large outbreaks, especially if they present chronic metabolic comorbidities, but also in their absence, making them an important group of concern after elders. COVID-19 mortality in middle-aged adults is likely proportional to the gradual decline in health that accompanies ageing, which presents earlier in poorer populations that also get more exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and have less access to specialized medical attention.","Dominguez-Ramirez, L.; Rodriguez-Perez, F.; Sosa-Jurado, F.; Santos-Lopez, G.; Cortes-Hernandez, P.",2020-12-17,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.12.15.20244160,2,Paulina Cortes-Hernandez,"Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Oriente (CIBIOR)",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.15.20244160v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.15.20244160v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
21390,On mobility trends analysis of COVID-19 dissemination in Mexico City,"This work presents a forecast of the spread of the new coronavirus in Mexico City based on a mathematical model with metapopulation structure by using Bayesian Statistics inspired in a data-driven approach. The mobility of humans on a daily basis in Mexico City is mathematically represented by a origin-destination matrix using the open mobility data from Google and a Transportation Mexican Survey. This matrix, is incorporated in a compartmental model. We calibrate the model against borough-level incidence data collected between February 27, 2020 and October 27, 2020 using Bayesian inference to estimate critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the coronavirus spread. Since working with metapopulation models lead to rather high computational time consume, we do a clustering analysis based on mobility trends in order to work on these clusters of borough separately instead of taken all the boroughs together at once. This clustering analysis could be implemented in smaller or lager scale in different part of the world. In addition, this clustering analysis is divided in the phases that the government of Mexico City has set up to restrict the individuals movement in the city. Also, we calculate the reproductive number in Mexico City using the next generation operator method and the inferred model parameters. The analysis of mobility trends can be helpful in public health decisions.","Prieto, K.; Chavez-Hernandez, M.; Romero-Leiton, J.

23187,Distinct systemic and mucosal immune responses to SARS-CoV-2,"Coordinated local mucosal and systemic immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection protect against COVID-19 pathologies or fail leading to severe clinical outcomes. To understand this process, we performed an integrated analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies, cytokines, viral load and 16S bacterial communities in paired nasopharyngeal swabs and plasma samples from a cohort of clinically distinct COVID-19 patients during acute infection. Plasma viral load was associated with systemic inflammatory cytokines that were elevated in severe COVID-19, and also with spike-specific neutralizing antibodies. In contrast, nasopharyngeal viral load correlated with SARS-CoV-2 humoral responses but inversely with interferon responses, the latter associating with protective microbial communities. Potential pathogenic microrganisms, often implicated in secondary respiratory infections, were associated with mucosal inflammation and elevated in severe COVID-19. Our results demonstrate distinct tissue compartmentalization of SARS-CoV-2 immune responses and highlight a role for the nasopharyngeal microbiome in regulating local and systemic immunity that determines COVID-19 clinical outcomes.","Smith, N.; Goncalves, P.; Charbit, B.; Grzelak, L.; Beretta, M.; Planchais, C.; Bruel, T.; Rouilly, V.; Bondet, V.; Hadjadj, J.; Yatim, N.; Pere, H.; Merkling, S.; Kerneis, S.; Rieux-Leucat, F.; Terrier, B.; Schwartz, O.; Mouquet, H.; Duffy, D.; Di Santo, J.",2021-03-02,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.03.01.21251633,1,James Di Santo,Institut Pasteur,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.01.21251633v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.01.21251633v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
17548,They're Dying in the Suburbs: COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Geography in Louisiana (USA),"The national COVID-19 conversation in the US has mostly focused on urban areas, without sufficient examination of another geography with large vulnerable populations: the suburbs. While suburbs are often thought of as areas of uniform affluence and racial homogeneity, over the past 20 years, poverty and diversity have increased substantially in the suburbs. In this study, we compare geographic and temporal trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths in Louisiana, one of the few states with high rates of COVID-19 during both the spring and summer. We find that incidence and mortality rates were initially highest in New Orleans. By the second peak, trends reversed: suburban areas experienced higher rates than New Orleans and similar rates to other urban and rural areas. We also find that increased social vulnerability was associated with increased positivity and incidence during the first peak. During the second peak, these associations reversed in New Orleans while persisting in other urban, suburban, and rural areas. The work draws attention to the high rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths in suburban areas and the importance of metropolitan-wide actions to address COVID-19.

4351,"Pregnancy outcomes, Newborn complications and Maternal-Fetal Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in women with COVID-19: A systematic review of 441 cases","ObjectiveThe aim of this systematic review was to examine the maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19 and also assess the incidence of maternal-fetal transmission of SARS CO-V-2 infection.

Data sourcesWe searched PUMBED. Medline, Embase, MedRxiv and bioRxiv databases upto 3rd May 2020 utilizing combinations of word variants for """"coronavirus"""" or """"COVID-19"""" or """"severe acute respiratory syndrome"""" or """"SARS-COV-2"""" and """"pregnancy"""". We also included data from preprint articles.

Study eligibility criteriaOriginal case reports and case series on pregnant women with diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Study appraisal and synthesis methodsWe included 50 studies reporting the information on 441 pregnant women and 391 neonates. The primary outcome measures were maternal health characteristics and adverse pregnancy outcomes, neonatal outcomes and SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates was extracted. Treatments given to pregnant women with COVID-19 were also recorded.

ResultsOut of 441 women affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, 387 women have delivered. There are nine maternal deaths reported. In pregnant women with COVID-19, the most common symptoms were fever (56%), cough (43%), myalgia (19%), dyspnea (18%) and diarrhea (6%). Pneumonia was diagnosed by CT scan imaging in 96 % of COVID-19 pregnant women. Pregnancy complications included delivery by cesarean section (80%), preterm labor (26%), fetal distress (8%) and premature rupture of membranes (9%). Six still births (2%) are reported. The most common co-morbidities associated with pregnant women with COVID-19 were hypertensive disorders (10%), diabetes (9%), placental disorders (2%), co-infections (3%), scarred uterus (3%) and hypothyroidism (3%). Amongst the neonates of COVID-19 mothers, preterm birth (25%), respiratory distress syndrome (8%), pneumonia (8%) were reported. There were four neonatal deaths reported. Vertical transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 8%.

ConclusionIn pregnant women with COVID-19, hypertensive disorders and diabetes are common comorbidities and there is a risk of preterm delivery and maternal death. Amongst the neonates born to mothers with COVID-19, respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia are common occurrence. There are reports of still births and neonatal deaths. There is an evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in women with COVID-19.","Gajbhiye, R.; Modi, D.; Mahale, S.",2020-05-05,Obstetrics And Gynecology,10.1101/2020.04.11.20062356,2,Rahul Gajbhiye,ICMR-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20062356v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20062356v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
19019,Epidemiological and Economic Impact of COVID-19 in the US,"This research measures the epidemiological and economic impact of COVID-19 spread in the US under different mitigation scenarios, comprising of non-pharmaceutical interventions. A detailed disease model of COVID-19 is combined with a model of the US economy to estimate the direct impact of labor supply shock to each sector arising from morbidity, mortality, and lockdown, as well as the indirect impact caused by the interdependencies between sectors. During a lockdown, estimates of jobs that are workable from home in each sector are used to modify the shock to labor supply. Results show trade-offs between economic losses, and lives saved and infections averted are non-linear in compliance to social distancing and the duration of lockdown. Sectors that are worst hit are not the labor-intensive sectors such as Agriculture and Construction, but the ones with high valued jobs such as Professional Services, even after the teleworkability of jobs is accounted for. Additionally, the findings show that a low compliance to interventions can be overcome by a longer shutdown period and vice versa to arrive at similar epidemiological impact but their net effect on economic loss depends on the interplay between the marginal gains from averting infections and deaths, versus the marginal loss from having healthy workers stay at home during the shutdown.","Chen, J.; Vullikanti, A.; Santos, J.; Venkatramanan, S.; Hoops, S.; Mortveit, H.; Lewis, B.; You, W.; Eubank, S.; Marathe, M.; Barrett, C.; Marathe, A.",2020-11-30,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.11.28.20239517,1,Achla Marathe,University of Virginia,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.28.20239517v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.28.20239517v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
11880,Outcomes of Mechanically Ventilated Patients with COVID-19 Associated Respiratory Failure,"PurposeThe outcomes of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 remain poorly defined. We sought to determine clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 managed with invasive mechanical ventilation in an appropriately resourced US health care system.

MethodsOutcomes of COVID-19 infected patients requiring mechanical ventilation treated within the Inova Health System between March 5, 2020 and April 26, 2020 were evaluated through an electronic medical record review.

Results1023 COVID-19 positive patients were admitted to the Inova Health System during the study period. Of these, 165 (16.1%) were managed with invasive mechanical ventilation. At the time of data censoring, 63/165 patients (38.1%) had died and 102/165 (61.8%) were still alive. Of the surviving 102 patients, 17 (10.3%) remained on mechanical ventilation, 51 (30.9%) were extubated but remained hospitalized, and 34 (20.6%) had been discharged. Deceased patients were older (median age of 66 vs. 55, p <0.0001). 75.7% of patients over 70 years old had died at the time of data analysis. Conversely, % of patients age 70 or younger were still alive at the time of data analysis. Younger age, non-Caucasian race and treatment at a tertiary care center were all associated with survivor status.

ConclusionMortality of patients with COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation is high, with particularly daunting mortality seen in patients of advanced age, even in a well-resourced health care system. A substantial proportion of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were not of advanced age, and this group had a reasonable chance for recovery.","King, C.; Sahjwani, D.; Brown, A.

13669,Longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance of over ten thousand health care workers in the Providence Oregon cohort.,"Frontline healthcare workers (HCW) are a high-risk population for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we present results from a large serosurveillance study of 10,019 asymptomatic HCW conducted during April-May 2020, in eight hospital medical centers across the state of Oregon, USA during the initial peak of the pandemic. Free and voluntary testing was performed at 14 +/- 3 day intervals, over a 4-week window at each site, utilizing a lab-developed ELISA based on the Epitope Diagnostics COVID-19 nucleocapsid IgG detection Kit. We identified 253 SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositive individuals among 10,019 total participants, representing a cross-sectional seroprevalence of 2.53%. Subgroup analysis identified differential seropositivity by job role, ranging from 8.03% among housekeepers, odds ratio 3.17 (95% CI 1.59-5.71), to 0.00% among anesthesiologists, odds ratio 0.00 (95% CI 0-0.26), both of which were significant. Over the course of the study, 17 seroconversions (0.25%) and 101 seroreversions (1.50%) were identified. Self-reported SARS-CoV-2 swab qPCR testing, when compared with subsequent serology on study, showed only modest agreement,{kappa} = 0.47 (95% CI 0.32-0.62). Overall, these findings demonstrate relatively low seroprevalence and very low seroconversion rates among HCW in Oregon, USA, over a period in which aggressive social distancing measures were in place. The high rate of seroreversion observed in this cohort, and the relatively high discordance between SARS-CoV-2 serology and swab qPCR, highlight limitations of current detection methods, and stress the need for development of novel assessment methodologies to more accurately identify exposure (and/or immunity) to SARS-CoV-2 in this population.","Leidner, R.; Frary, A.; Cramer, J.; Ball, D.; Weerasinghe, R.; Schmidt, M.; Jin, J.; Luzzi, V.; Saitman, A.; Young, J.

21334,Problems with Evidence Assessment in COVID-19 Health Policy Impact Evaluation (PEACHPIE): A systematic review of study design and evidence strength,"IntroductionAssessing the impact of COVID-19 policy is critical for informing future policies. However, there are concerns about the overall strength of COVID-19 impact evaluation studies given the circumstances for evaluation and concerns about the publication environment. This study systematically reviewed the strength of evidence in the published COVID-19 policy impact evaluation literature.

MethodsWe included studies that were primarily designed to estimate the quantitative impact of one or more implemented COVID-19 policies on direct SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 outcomes. After searching PubMed for peer-reviewed articles published on November 26 or earlier and screening, all studies were reviewed by three reviewers first independently and then to consensus. The review tool was based on previously developed and release review guidance for COVID-19 policy impact evaluation, assessing what impact evaluation method was used, graphical display of outcomes data, functional form for the outcomes, timing between policy and impact, concurrent changes to the outcomes, and an overall rating.

ResultsAfter 102 articles were identified as potentially meeting inclusion criteria, we identified 36 published articles that evaluated the quantitative impact of COVID-19 policies on direct COVID-19 outcomes. The majority (n=23/36) of studies in our sample examined the impact of stay-at-home requirements. Nine studies were set aside because the study design was considered inappropriate for COVID-19 policy impact evaluation (n=8 pre/post; n=1 cross-section), and 27 articles were given a full consensus assessment. 20/27 met criteria for graphical display of data, 5/27 for functional form, 19/27 for timing between policy implementation and impact, and only 3/27 for concurrent changes to the outcomes. Only 1/27 studies passed all of the above checks, and 4/27 were rated as overall appropriate. Including the 9 studies set aside, reviewers found that only four of the 36 identified published and peer-reviewed health policy impact evaluation studies passed a set of key design checks for identifying the causal impact of policies on COVID-19 outcomes.

DiscussionThe reviewed literature directly evaluating the impact of COVID-19 policies largely failed to meet key design criteria for useful inference. This was largely driven by the circumstances under which policies were passed making it difficult to attribute changes in COVID-19 outcomes to particular policies. More reliable evidence review is needed to both identify and produce policy-actionable evidence, alongside the recognition that actionable evidence is often unlikely to be feasible.","Haber, N.

14729,Social capital and psychological distress during Colombian coronavirus disease lockdown,"IntroductionThis study aims to establish the association between low capital social (CS) with some indicators of psychological distress.

MethodsA cross-sectional study was carried out using an online questionnaire that evaluated demographic variables, social capital, coronavirus disease perceived stress, depression risk, insomnia risk, and suicide risk. SC was taken as an independent variable, and symptoms indicating psychological distress was handed as dependent variables. Odds ratios (OR) were established with 95% confidence intervals (CI), using binary logistic regression analysis.

ResultsA group of 700 adults participated in the survey; they were aged between 18 and 76 years (M = 37, SD = 13). Low SC was associated with depression risk (OR = 2.00, 95%CI 1.34-2.97), elevated suicide risk (OR = 2.62, 95%CI 1.40-4.91) high perceived stress related to coronavirus disease (OR = 2.08, 95%CI 1.15-3.76), and insomnia risk (OR = 2.42, 95%CI 1.69-3.47).

ConclusionsLow CS was associated with indicators of psychological distress represented in depression risk, elevated suicide risk, high perceived stress related to coronavirus disease and insomnia risk. SC is a community social resource that could help mitigate the impact of the coronavirus disease quarantine amidst the Colombian populations psychological health. It is necessary to deepen the SC role in psychological well-being during and after the coronavirus disease epidemic.","Caballero-Dominguez, C.

2344,68 Consecutive patients assessed for COVID-19 infection; experience from a UK regional infectious disease unit,"Clinical assessment of possible infection with SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the outbreak of COVID-19 respiratory illness, has been a major activity of infectious diseases services in the UK and elsewhere since the first report of cases in December 2019. We report our case series of 68 patients, reviewed by Infectious Diseases Consultants at a Regional Infectious Diseases Unit in the UK. We prospectively evaluated our service between the 29th Jan 2020 and 24th Feb 2020.

Demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected. We have compared clinical features and subsequent diagnosis between well patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment.

Final microbiological diagnoses included SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), Mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza A, RSV, non SARS/MERS coronaviruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus. 9/68 were treated with antimicrobials, 15/68 were admitted to a negative pressure room of whom 5/68 were admitted solely due to an inability to isolate at home. Patients requiring either admission on clinical grounds or antimicrobials (14/68) were similar to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials, with modestly more fever and shortness of breath in the clinically admitted / antimicrobial group. The most commonly prescribed antimicrobials were doxycycline, moxifloxacin and oseltamivir.

The majority of patients had mild illness which did not require a clinical intervention to manage. This finding supports a community testing approach supported by clinicians to review the proportion of more unwell patients.","Easom, N.; Moss, P.; Barlow, G.; Samson, A.; Taynton, T.; Adams, K.; Ivan, M.; Burns, P.; Gajee, K.; Eastick, K.; Lillie, P.",2020-03-06,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.02.29.20029462,1,Patrick Lillie,"Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Hull, East Yorkshire, United Kingdom",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029462v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029462v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1111/irv.12739
15008,Socio-demographic correlate of knowledge and practice toward novel coronavirus among people living in Mosul-Iraq: A cross-sectional study,"Background: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a worldwide pandemic, as the Iraqi authorities have started responding and taking action to control the spread of the pandemic. The knowledge and practices of the public play an important role in curbing the spreading of the virus by following the health guidelines. This study aimed to assess the socio-demographic correlate of knowledge and practices of Iraqi living in Mosul-Iraq towards novel coronavirus during its rapid rise. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of 909 participants was conducted among Mosul-Iraq between 20th June to 1st July 2020. The survey included three parts: 1) socio-demographic characteristics, 2) participants' knowledge, 3) participants' practices. T-test, ANOVA, chi-square, and binary logistic regression were used. A p-value less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) was considered statistically significant. Results: The results showed knowledge and practice mean score of (12.91\1.67) and (21.56\2.92) with cumulative knowledge and practice of 86% and 76% respectively towards 2019-nCoV. Socio-demographic characteristics such as age, marital status, gender, level of education and employment were statistically related with a higher mean score of knowledge and practice towards the virus as P<0.05. Conclusions: We concluded that the majority of the respondents demonstrate a high level of knowledge and practices towards 2019-nCoV except respondents with socio-demographic characteristics such as those who were younger, male respondents, those with lower education and those unemployed as such campaigns that will increase the knowledge and encourage adequate preventive practice towards 2019-nCoV should be targeted towards this group.","Qubais, B.; Al-Shahrabi, R.

2915,A model for COVID-19 prediction in Iran based on China parameters,"BackgroundThe rapid spread of COVID-19 virus from China to other countries and outbreaks of disease require an epidemiological analysis of the disease in the shortest time and an increased awareness of effective interventions. The purpose of this study was to estimate the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran based on the SIR model. The results of the analysis of the epidemiological data of Iran from January 22 to March 8, 2020 were investigated and the prediction was made until March 29, 2020.

MethodsBy estimating the three parameters of time-dependent transmission rate, time-dependent recovery rate, and time-dependent mortality rate from Covid-19 outbreak in China, and using the number of Covid-19 infections in Iran, we predicted the number of patients for the next month in Iran. Each of these parameters was estimated using GAM models. All analyses were conducted in R software using the mgcv package.

FindingsOn average, 925 people with COVID-19 are expected to be infected daily in Iran. The epidemic peaks within one week (15.03.2020 to 03.21.2020) and reaches its highest point on 03.18.2020 with 1126 infected cases.

ConclusionThe most important point is to emphasize the timing of the epidemic peak, hospital readiness, government measures and public readiness to reduce social contact.","Zareie, B.; Roshani, A.; Mansournia, M.

6468,Multivariate Prediction Network Model for epidemic progression to study the effects of lockdown time and coverage on a closed community on theoretical and real scenarios of COVID-19.,"The aim of this study was to develop a realistic network model to predict the relationship between lockdown duration and coverage in controlling the progression of the incidence curve of an epidemic with the characteristics of COVID-19 in two scenarios (1) a closed and non-immune population, and (2) a real scenario from State of Rio de Janeiro from May 6th 2020.

Effects of lockdown time and rate on the progression of an epidemic incidence curve in a virtual population of 10 thousand subjects. Predictor variables were reproductive values established in the most recent literature (R0 =2.7 and 5.7, and Re = 1.28 from Rio de Janeiro State at May 6th), without lockdown and with coverages of 25%, 50%, and 90% for 21, 35, 70, and 140 days in up to 13 different scenarios for each R0/Re, where individuals remained infected and transmitters for 14 days. We estimated model validity in theoretical and real scenarios respectively by applying an exponential model on the incidence curve with no lockdown with growth rate coefficient observed in realistic scenarios, and (2) fitting real data series from RJ upon simulated data, respectively.

For R0=5.7, the flattening of the curve occurs only with long lockdown periods (70 and 140 days) with a 90% coverage. For R0=2.7, coverages of 25 and 50% also result in curve flattening and reduction of total cases, provided they occur for a long period (70 days or more). For realistic scenario in Rio de Janeiro, lockdowns +25% or more from May 6th during 140 days showed expressive flattening and number of COVID cases two to five times lower. If a more intense coverage lockdown (about +25 to +50% as much as the current one) will be implemented until June 6th during at least 70 days, it is still possible reduce nearly 40-50% the impact of pandemy in state of Rio de Janeiro.

These data corroborate the importance of lockdown duration regardless of virus transmission and sometimes of intensity of coverage, either in realistic or theoretical scenarios of COVID-10 epidemics. Even later, the improvement of lockdown coverage can be effective to minimize the impact of epidemic.","Abramov, D. M.; Gomes Junior, S.

This feasibility study looks at the method of upper-room ultraviolet (UV) air disinfection that has already proven its efficacy in preventing the transmission of airborne diseases such as measles and tuberculosis.

Using published data from various sources it is shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, is highly likely to be susceptible to UV damage while suspended in air irradiated by UV-C at levels that are acceptable and safe for upper-room applications. This is while humans are present in the room. Both the expected and worst-case scenarios are investigated to show the efficacy of the upper-room UV-C approach to reduce COVID-19 air transmission in a confined space with moderate but sufficient height. Discussion is given on the methods of analysis and the differences between virus susceptibility to UV-C when aerosolised or in liquid or on a surface.","Beggs, C. B.; Avital, E.

13803,3D Printed Snorkel Mask Adapter for Failed N95 Fit Tests and PPE Shortages,"IntroductionThe shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) across the country has been widely discussed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, recent reports indicate that PPE shortages persist amidst continually increasing caseloads nationwide. Additionally, there have been reports of poor-fitting masks, a problem which is magnified by shortages. The lack of adequate access to conventional N95 masks pushed for some to pursue 3D printing and locally distributing their own manufactured masks as substitutes when PPE, including N95 masks, were not readily available. The design presented, the snorkel mask adapter, is one such design born from the local maker community in partnership with local physicians and hospitals. This article discusses the design, manufacturing, and validation of the snorkel mask adapter and its immediate use in the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future use as stopgap PPE.

MethodsThe design presented is an adapter which can be used with a commercially available snorkel mask in order to serve as a full face respirator in either the case of a PPE shortage or more pertinently for those who are unable to pass fit testing with the available N95 respirators at their respective facilities. Mask components were 3D printed, assembled, and then fit tested by qualitative fit testing (QLFT) at The University of Kansas Health System (TUKHS) in Kansas City, KS as a proof of concept.

ResultsAt TUKHS, the mask was fit tested on 22 individuals who required an N95 mask but were not able to pass qualitative fit testing with the masks available to them at the time. Of the 22 tested, all 22 of them were able to pass QLFT with the snorkel mask, adapter, and viral/bacterial filter combination.

ConclusionThe results of the fit testing at TUKHS is promising for this N95 alternative. More extensive testing can and should be done, including quantitative fit testing. Persistently increasing caseloads and PPE shortages necessitates an urgent dissemination of these preliminary results. The authors do not advocate for this design as a replacement of traditional N95 masks or other PPE but do endorse this design as a stopgap measure, proven to be effective in situations of dire PPE shortage or for individuals who have failed fit testing with conventional PPE.","Dalla, S.; Shinde, R.; Ayres, J.

26426,Evolution of COVID-19 symptoms during the first 9 months after illness onset,"BackgroundFew longitudinal data on COVID-19 symptoms across the full spectrum of disease severity are available. We evaluated symptom onset, severity and recovery up to nine months after illness onset.

MethodsThe RECoVERED Study is a prospective cohort study based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Participants aged>18 years were recruited following SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis via the local Public Health Service and from hospitals. Standardised symptom questionnaires were completed at recruitment, at one week and month after recruitment, and monthly thereafter. Clinical severity was defined according to WHO criteria. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to compare time from illness onset to symptom recovery, by clinical severity. We examined determinants of time to recovery using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.

ResultsBetween 11 May 2020 and 31 January 2021, 301 COVID-19 patients (167[55%] male) were recruited, of whom 99/301(32.9%) had mild, 140/301(46.5%) moderate, 30/301(10.0%) severe and 32/301(10.6%) critical disease. The proportion of symptomatic participants who reported at least one persistent symptom at 12 weeks after illness onset was greater in those with severe/critical disease (81.7%[95%CI=68.7-89.7%]) compared to those with mild or moderate disease (33.0%[95%CI=23.0-43.3%] and 63.8%[95%CI=54.8-71.5%]). Even at nine months after illness onset, almost half of all participants (42.1%[95%CI=35.6-48.5]) overall continued to report [&ge;]1 symptom.

19009,"Changes COVID-19 Post-Quarantine Behaviors, Hygiene and Expectations in Colombia: Population Survey from 1st to 13th September, 2020.","This study by Profamilia Association focuses on the social response to COVID19 by reporting and analyzing the answers to two surveys carried out between April 16 and 25, and throughout September 2020. The study aims to identify changes in behaviors and immediate expectations after the quarantine was lifted. In general, results show that people have adopted behavioral changes such as wearing face masks, avoiding people with symptoms, and reducing mobility. However, it also shows that peoples concerns have doubled for many reasons, ranging from mental health issues, neglected sexual and reproductive health needs, the burden of care for others, and working from home. Similarly, it was found that some people would accept significant long-term changes such as accepting most children continuing to be homeschooled or employees choosing whether to work or not, targeted quarantines in neighborhoods that show high number of cases; and making the use of face masks mandatory in case a vaccine or treatment for Covid-19 does not become available. This means that during the quarantine and compared to April, many people consider these options to be acceptable in the long term.

The survey was filled out online via SurveyMonkey by 1,735 people in Colombia between 1st and 11th September, 2020. Overall, 17% mentioned that they had participated in the previous survey, Estudio Solidaridad I early stage of quarantine (April 2020). The following is a summary of the main findings based on the comparison of the two surveys in hopes to show evidence for changes in behavior, hygiene, levels of measure compliance, unmet needs, and to show people[s] immediate expectations after six months of strict quarantine.

O_LIThe most common concerns among the findings were: a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 not arriving Colombia soon enough (79%), a vaccine or treatment not being developed soon enough (79%) and also a concern that once the vaccine arrives in Colombia, it will not be accessible (74%). 50% of people think it is likely to get the COVID-19 vaccine once it becomes readily available.
C_LIO_LI62% get information about COVID-19 through social media, 55% through official websites, and 51% through television.
C_LIO_LI43% say that in their neighborhood, community, social group, or town, measures and campaigns have been carried out to prevent the spread of the COVID-19.
C_LIO_LI25% say they would like to support local communities respond to the outbreak.
C_LIO_LI82% agree with most children remaining home-schooled.
C_LIO_LI85% think parents should be able to choose whether or not to send their children to school.
C_LIO_LI95% agree that people should be forced to wear face masks outside the home.
C_LIO_LI90% agree with neighborhoods, districts, or municipalities which experience outbreaks adopting more restrictive measures compared to the country as a whole.
C_LIO_LI86% think employees should choose whether to work in their office or work from home.
C_LIO_LI44% think that people will be able to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in a year or a year and a half.
C_LIO_LI26% think life will return to """"normal"""" in two years or more.

22573,An exploratory study on the correlation of population SARS-CoV-2 cycle threshold values to local disease dynamics,"IntroductionDespite limitations on the use of cycle threshold (CT) values for individual patient care, population distributions of CT values may be useful indicators of local outbreaks.

MethodsSpecimens from the greater El Paso area were processed in the Dascena COVID-19 Laboratory. Daily median CT value, daily transmission rate R(t), daily count of COVID-19 hospitalizations, daily change in percent positivity, and rolling averages of these features were plotted over time. Two-way scatterplots and linear regression evaluated possible associations between daily median CT and outbreak measures. Cross-correlation plots determined whether a time delay existed between changes in the daily median CT value and measure of community disease dynamics.

ResultsDaily median CT was negatively correlated with the daily R(t), the daily COVID-19 hospitalization count (with a time delay), and the daily change in percent positivity among testing samples. Despite visual trends suggesting time delays in the plots for median CT and outbreak measures, a statistically significant delay was only detected between changes in median CT and COVID-19 hospitalization count.

ConclusionsThis study adds to the literature by analyzing samples collected from an entire geographical area, and contextualizing the results with other research investigating population CT values.","Tso, C.

21893,Emergence of first strains of Sars-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 in Romania,"United Kingdom reported the emergence of a new and highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7. that rapidly spread to other contries. The impact of this new mutation that occurs in the S protein, on infectivity, virulence and current vaccine effectiveness is still under evaluation. We have identified the first cases of the B.1.1.7 variant in samples collected from Romanian patients, of which one was traced to the UK region where the new variant was originally sequenced. Mutations in the Nsp3 protein, N844S and D455N and L15F in Orf3a were also detected, indicating common ancestry with UK strains as well as remote connections with strains from Nagasaki, Japan. These results indicate, for the first time, the presence and characteristics of the new variant B.1.1.7 in Romania and underscore the need for increased genomic sequencing in confirmed COVID-19 patients.","Lobiuc, A.; Dimian, M.; Sturdza, O.; Filip, R.; Covasa, M.",2021-02-01,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.01.29.21250643,1,Mihai Covasa,"Universitatea Stefan cel Mare Suceava, Romania",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.29.21250643v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.29.21250643v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
18081,Independent Dentists in the UK have less access to Occupational Health,"ObjectivesRespiratory illnesses like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and the current SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic are transmitted by respiratory droplets. Certain dental procedures generate aerosols, one of the highest sources of transmission of droplet infections. During the current pandemic, dentists in the UK were initially restricted in their work and now have guidance from NHS England and the Chief Dental Officer for the full resumption of safe and effective routine dental care to patients. Lack of work, impact on income and working in the continual pandemic situation are likely to cause significant mental stress in dentists. Occupational health (OH) can have a vital role to help such dentists remain in work by advising strategies to cope with stress and offering timely evidence-based interventions and adjustments. The aim was to assess if the dentists in the UK had access to OH and whether access to the OH services helped.

MethodsA survey link was sent to 200 dentists in the UK after the peak of the current pandemic.

Results124 dentists responded to the survey. The response rate was 62%. 59% of the dentists in the survey did not have access to OH services in their workplace. Only 15% of dentists working in the independent sector had access to OH services compared to 78% working in the NHS or having NHS contracts. None of the dentists in the survey accessed OH services.

ConclusionsAccess to OH services for the dentists needs improvement, particularly in the Independent sector in the UK.

24380,Chagas disease and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection does not lead to worse in-hospital outcomes: results from the Brazilian COVID-19 Registry,"ObjectiveChagas disease (CD) continues to be a major public health burden in Latina America, where co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 can occur. However, information on the interplay between COVID-19 and Chagas disease is lacking. Our aim was to assess clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes of patients with CD and COVID-19, and to compare it to non-CD patients.

MethodsPatients with COVID-19 diagnosis were selected from the Brazilian COVID-19 Registry, a prospective multicenter cohort, from March to September, 2020. CD diagnosis was based on hospital record at the time of admission. Study data were collected by trained hospital staff using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tools. Genetic matching for sex, age, hypertension, DM and hospital was performed in a 4:1 ratio.

ResultsOf the 7,018 patients who had confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the registry, 31 patients with CD and 124 matched controls were included. Overall, the median age was 72 (64.-80) years-old and 44.5% were male. At baseline, heart failure (25.8% vs. 9.7%) and atrial fibrillation (29.0% vs. 5.6%) were more frequent in CD patients than in the controls (p<0.05 for both). C-reactive protein levels were lower in CD patients compared with the controls (55.5 [35.7, 85.0] vs. 94.3 [50.7, 167.5] mg/dL). Seventy-two (46.5%) patients required admission to the intensive care unit. In-hospital management, outcomes and complications were similar between the groups.

ConclusionsIn this large Brazilian COVID-19 Registry, CD patients had a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation and chronic heart failure compared with non-CD controls, with no differences in-hospital outcomes. The lower C-reactive protein levels in CD patients require further investigation.

11697,Short-term analysis and long-term predictions for the COVID-19 epidemic in a seasonality regime: the Italian case,"As of July 14th, COVID-19 has caused in Italy 34.984 deaths and 243.344 infection cases. Strict lockdown policies were necessary to contain the first outbreak wave and prevent the Italian healthcare system from being overwhelmed by patients requiring intensive care. After the progressive reopening, predicting how the epidemic situation will evolve is urgent and fundamental to control any future outbreak and prevent a second wave. We defined a time-varying optimization procedure to repeatedly calibrate the SIDARTHE model1 with data up to June 24th. The computed parameter distributions allow us to robustly analyse how the epidemic situation evolved and outline possible future scenarios. Assuming a seasonal regime for COVID-19, we tested different lockdown policies. Our results suggest that an intermittent lockdown where six """"open days"""" are allowed every other week may prevent a resurgent exponential outbreak and, at the same time, ease the societal burden of an extensive lockdown.","Simoni, G.; Fochesato, A.; Reali, F.; Giordano, G.; Domenici, E.; Marchetti, L.",2020-07-24,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.15.20154500,2,Luca Marchetti,"Fondazione The Microsoft Research - University of Trento, Centre for Computational and Systems Biology (COSBI)",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154500v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154500v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
14503,Exploring the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical education: an international cross-sectional study of medical learners,"To broadly explore the extent that COVID-19 has initially impacted medical learners around the world and examine global trends and patterns across geographic regions and levels of training, a cross-sectional survey of medical learners was conducted between March 25-June 14th, 2020, shortly after the World Health Organization declared concurrent COVID-19 a pandemic. 6492 medical learners completed the survey from 140 countries, Students were concerned about the quality of their learning, training progression, and milestone fulfillment. Most trainees felt under-utilized and wanted to be engaged clinically in meaningful ways; however, some trainees felt that contributing to healthcare during a pandemic was beyond the scope of a medical learner. Statistically significant differences were detected between levels of training and geographic regions for satisfaction with organizational responses, the impact of COVID-19 on wellness, and state-trait anxiety. Overall, the initial disruption to medical training has been perceived by learners across all levels and geographic regions to have negatively affected their training and well-being, particularly amongst postgraduate trainees. These results provide initial insights into the areas that warrant future research as well as consideration for current and future policy planning, such as the policies for clinical utilization of medical learners during public health emergencies.","Brown, A.; Kassam, A.; Paget, M.; Blades, K.; Mercia, M.; Kachra, R.",2020-09-03,Medical Education,10.1101/2020.09.01.20186304,1,Allison Brown,"University of Calgary - Cumming School of Medicine, Department of Medicine and Community Health Sciences",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20186304v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20186304v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.36834/cmej.71149
5284,Forecast and interpretation of daily affected people during 21 days lockdown due to COVID 19 pandemic in India,"The problem of facing difficulty to control the spreading of newly detected novel corona virus 2019 is a matter of attention throughout the whole world. The total numbers of infected individuals have already crossed 2 million throughout the world. The government of all the affected countries have already taken many measures like lockdown to stop the spread. Therefore, it is important to study the nature of growth and interpretations are necessary for taking needful by the government. In this paper, we have tried to interpret the spreading capability of novel corona virus in India taking into consideration of 21 days lockdown data. The prediction is based on the present number of available cases and number of new cases reporting daily. We have explained the number of infected people in India comparing with Italy, China, Spain, and USA data of 21 days individually after announcing lockdown. The plot of daily new cases with the number of days spent after lockdown is fitted by linear and polynomial function. The best fitted graph is chosen for interpretation and that is based on the parameters obtained from fitting. The forecast of maximum spreading possibility is discussed with linear and 4-degree polynomial fitting parameters.

10587,Impact of the accuracy of case-based surveillance data on the estimation of time-varying reproduction numbers,"Studies aimed at characterizing the evolution of COVID-19 disease often rely on case-based surveillance data publicly released by health authorities, that can be incomplete and prone to errors. Here, we quantify the biases caused by the use of inaccurate data in the estimation of the Time-Varying Reproduction Number R(t). By focusing on Italy and Spain, two of the hardest-hit countries in Europe and worldwide, we show that if the symptoms onset time-series is inferred from the notification date series, the R(t) curve cannot capture nor describe accurately the early dynamics of the epidemic. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the containment measures that were implemented, such as national lockdowns, can be properly evaluated only when R(t) is estimated using the real time-series of dates of symptoms onset. Our findings show that extreme care should be taken when a pivotal quantity like R(t) is used to make decisions and to evaluate different alternatives.","Starnini, M.; Aleta, A.; Tizzoni, M.; Moreno, Y.",2020-06-28,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.26.20140871,1,Michele Starnini,"ISI Foundation, Turin, Italy",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.20140871v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.20140871v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,"NA"

We use a simple model to give point estimates of the effective reproduction numbers of the B.1.617.2 and B.1.1.7 lineages in England, from sequenced data as at 15 May 2021. Comparison with the estimated reproduction number of B.1.1.7 enables an estimate of the increased transmissibility of B.1.617.2. We conclude that it is almost certain that there is increased transmissibility that will rapidly lead to B.1.617.2 becoming the prevailing variant in the UK. The derived estimates of increased transmissibility have uncertainty relating to the actual distribution of the generation interval, but they do point, under present conditions of vaccination coverage and NPIs, to exponential growth of positive cases.","Dagpunar, J.

10570,Cost Benefit Analysis of Limited Reopening Relative to a Herd Immunity Strategy or Shelter in Place for SARS-CoV-2 in the United States,"BackgroundFierce debate about the health and financial tradeoffs presented by different COVID-19 pandemic mitigation strategies highlights the need for rigorous quantitative evaluation of policy options.

ObjectiveTo quantify the economic value of the costs and benefits of a policy of continued limited reopening with social distancing relative to alternative COVID-19 response strategies in the United States.

DesignWe estimate the number and value of quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained from mortality averted, with a value of $125,000 per QALY, and compare these benefits to the associated costs in terms of plausible effects on US GDP under a policy of continued limited reopening with social distancing relative to a policy of full reopening toward herd immunity. Using the same QALY value assumptions, we further evaluate cost-effectiveness of a return to Shelter-in-Place relative to a policy of limited reopening.

SettingUnited States

MeasurementsQALY and cost as percent of GDP of limited reopening with continued social distancing relative to a strategy of full reopening aimed at achieving herd immunity; a limited reopening """"budget"""" measured in the number of months before this strategy fails to demonstrate cost-effectiveness relative to a full reopening; a shelter-in-place """"threshold"""" measured in the number of lives saved at which a month of sheltering in place demonstrates cost effectiveness relative to the limited reopening strategy.

ResultsQALY benefits from mortality averted by continued social distancing and limited reopening relative to a policy of full reopening exceed projected GDP costs if an effective vaccine or therapeutic can be developed within 11.1 months from late May 2020. White House vaccine projections fall within this date, supporting a partial reopening strategy. One month of shelter-in-place restrictions provides QALY benefits from averted mortality that exceed the associated GDP costs relative to limited reopening if the restrictions prevent at least 154,586 additional COVID-19 deaths over the course of the pandemic. Current models of disease progression suggest that limited reopening will not cause this many additional deaths, again supporting a limited reopening strategy.

LimitationLimited horizon of COVID-19 mortality projections; infection fatality ratio stable across strategies, ignoring both the potential for ICU overload to increase mortality and the deployment of partially effective therapeutics to decrease mortality; effect on GDP modeled as constant within a given phase of the pandemic; accounts for age and sex distribution of QALYs, but not effect of comorbidities; only considers impact from QALY lost due to mortality and from changes in GDP, excluding numerous other considerations, such as non-fatal COVID-19 morbidity, reduced quality of life caused by prolonged social distancing, or educational regression associated with prolonged school closures and restrictions.

ConclusionsA limited reopening to achieve partial mitigation of COVID-19 is cost effective relative to a full reopening if an effective therapeutic or vaccine can be deployed within 11.1 months of late May 2020. One additional month of shelter-in-place restrictions should only be imposed if it saves at least 154,586 lives per month before the development of an effective therapeutic or vaccine relative to limited reopening.

AimWe examined the effect of social distancing on acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients referral to the emergency department (ED)

MethodA retrospective archive study was conducted between January 2017 and April 2020 in a comprehensive stroke center. We compare the number of neurologic consultations, time from symptoms onset to ED arrival, patients diagnosis with AIS, number of patients receiving treatment (tPA, endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) or combine) and in-hospital death.

ResultsThe analysis included a total of 14,626 neurological consultations from the years 2017 to 2020. A significant decrease of 58.6% was noted during the months of January-April of the year 2020 compared to the parallel period of 2017.

8914,"Are adversities and worries during the COVID-19 pandemic related to sleep quality? Longitudinal analyses of 48,000 UK adults","There are concerns that both the experience of adversities during the COVID-19 pandemic and worries about experiencing adversities will have substantial and lasting effects on mental health. One pathway through which both experience of and worries about adversity may impact health is through effects on sleep. We used data from 48,723 UK adults in the COVID-19 Social Study assessed weekly from 01/04/2020-12/05/2020 to study the association between adversities and sleep quality. We studied six categories of adversity including both worries and experiences of: illness with COVID-19, financial difficulty, loss of paid work, difficulties acquiring medication, difficulties accessing food, and threats to personal safety. We used random-effect within-between models to account for all time-invariant confounders. Both the total number of adversity experiences and total number of adversity worries were associated with lower quality sleep. Each additional experience was associated with a 1.16 (95% CI = 1.10, 1.22) times higher odds of poor quality sleep while each additional worry was associated with a 1.20 (95% CI = 1.17, 1.22) times higher odds of poor quality sleep. When considering specific experiences and worries, all worries and experiences were significantly related to poorer quality sleep except experiences relating to employment and finances.

10460,Tocilizumab and steroid treatment in patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia.,"IntroductionCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can lead to respiratory failure due to severe immune response. Treatment targeting this immune response might be beneficial but there is limited evidence on its efficacy.

The aim of this study was to determine if early treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with tocilizumab and/or steroids was associated with better outcome.

MethodsThis observational single-center study included patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were not intubated and received either standard of care (SOC, controls) or SOC plus early (within 3 days from hospital admission) anti-inflammatory treatment. SOC consisted of hydroxychloroquine 400mg bid plus, in those admitted before March 24th, also darunavir/ritonavir. Anti-inflammatory treatment consisted of either tocilizumab (8mg/kg intravenously or 162mg subcutaneously) or methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg for 5 days or both. Failure was defined as intubation or death, and the endpoints were failure-free survival (primary endpoint) and overall survival (secondary) at day 30. Difference between the groups was estimated as Hazard Ratio by a propensity score weighted Cox regression analysis (HROW).

ResultsOverall, 196 adults were included in the analyses. They were mainly male (67.4%), with comorbidities (78.1%) and severe COVID-19 pneumonia (83.7%). Median age was 67.9 years (range, 30-100) and median PaO2/FiO2 200 mmHg (IQR 133-289). Among them, 130 received early anti-inflammatory treatment with: tocilizumab (n=29, 22.3%), methylprednisolone (n=45, 34.6%), or both (n=56, 43.1%). The adjusted failure-free survival among tocilizumab/methylprednisolone/SOC treated patients vs. SOC was 80.8% (95%CI, 72.8-86.7) vs. 64.1% (95%CI, 51.3-74.0), HROW 0.48, 95%CI, 0.23-0.99; p=0.049. The overall survival among tocilizumab/methylprednisolone/SOC patients vs. SOC was 85.9% (95%CI, 80.7-92.6) vs. 71.9% (95%CI, 46-73), HROW 0.41, 95%CI: 0.19-0.89, p=0.025.

ConclusionEarly adjunctive treatment with tocilizumab, methylprednisolone or both may improve outcomes in non-intubated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Mikulska, M.; Nicolini, L.

11584,"The natural history of symptomatic COVID-19 in Catalonia, Spain: a multi-state model including 109,367 outpatient diagnoses, 18,019 hospitalisations, and 5,585 COVID-19 deaths among 5,627,520 people","BackgroundThe natural history of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has yet to be fully described, with most previous reports focusing on hospitalised patients. Using linked patient-level data, we set out to describe the associations between age, gender, and comorbidities and the risk of outpatient COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation, and/or related mortality.

MethodsA population-based cohort study including all individuals registered in Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP). SIDIAP includes primary care records covering > 80% of the population of Catalonia, Spain, and was linked to region-wide testing, hospital and mortality records. Outpatient diagnoses of COVID-19, hospitalisations with COVID-19, and deaths with COVID-19 were identified between 1st March and 6th May 2020. A multi-state model was used, with cause-specific Cox survival models estimated for each transition.

FindingsA total of 5,627,520 individuals were included. Of these, 109,367 had an outpatient diagnosis of COVID-19, 18,019 were hospitalised with COVID-19, and 5,585 died after either being diagnosed or hospitalised with COVID-19. Half of those who died were not admitted to hospital prior to their death. Risk of a diagnosis with COVID-19 peaked first in middle-age and then again for oldest ages, risk for hospitalisation after diagnosis peaked around 70 years old, with all other risks highest at oldest ages. Male gender was associated with an increased risk for all outcomes other than outpatient diagnosis. The comorbidities studied (autoimmune condition, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, heart disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, malignant neoplasm, obesity, and type 2 diabetes) were all associated with worse outcomes.

InterpretationThere is a continued need to protect those at high risk of poor outcomes, particularly the elderly, from COVID-19 and provide appropriate care for those who develop symptomatic disease. While risks of hospitalisation and death are lower for younger populations, there is a need to limit their role in community transmission. These findings should inform public health strategies, including future vaccination campaigns.","Burn, E.; Tebe, C.; Fernandez-Bertolin, S.; Aragon, M.; Recalde, M.; Roel, E.; Prats-Uribe, A.; Prieto-Alhambra, D.; Duarte-Salles, T.",2020-07-14,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.07.13.20152454,1,Daniel Prieto-Alhambra,"1) Centre for Statistics in Medicine (CSM), Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS), University of Oxford, UK",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152454v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152454v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,"NA"

27056,Genomic reconstruction of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic across England from September 2020 to May 2021,"Despite regional successes in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, global cases have reached an all time high in April 2021 in part due to the evolution of more transmissible variants. Here we use the dense genomic surveillance generated by the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium to reconstruct the dynamics of 62 different lineages in each of 315 English local authorities between September 2020 and April 2021. This analysis reveals a series of sub-epidemics that peaked in the early autumn of 2020, followed by a singular jump in transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 lineage. B.1.1.7 grew when other lineages declined during the second national lockdown and regionally tiered restrictions between November and December 2020. A third more stringent national lockdown eventually suppressed B.1.1.7 and eliminated nearly all other lineages in early 2021. However, a series of variants (mostly containing the spike E484K mutation) defied these trends and persisted at moderately increasing proportions. Accounting for sustained introductions, however, indicates that their transmissibility is unlikely to exceed that of B.1.1.7. Finally, B.1.617.2 was repeatedly introduced to England and grew rapidly in April 2021, constituting approximately 40% of sampled COVID-19 genomes on May 15.","Vohringer, H.

8677,Factors associated with adherence to self-isolation and lockdown measures in the UK; a cross-sectional survey,"ObjectivesTo investigate factors associated with adherence to self-isolation and lockdown measures due to COVID-19 in the UK.

DesignOnline cross-sectional survey.

SettingData were collected between 6th and 7th May 2020.

Participants2240 participants living in the UK aged 18 years or over. Participants were recruited from YouGovs online research panel.

Main outcome measuresHaving gone out in the last 24 hours in those who reported symptoms of COVID-19 in their household. Having gone out shopping for items other than groceries, toiletries or medicines (non-essentials), and total number of outings, in the last week in those who reported no symptoms of COVID-19 in their household.

Results217 people (9.7%) reported that they or someone in their household had symptoms of COVID-19 (cough or high temperature / fever) in the last seven days. Of these people, 75.1% had left the home in the last 24 hours (defined as non-adherent). Factors associated with non-adherence were being male, less worried about COVID-19, and perceiving a smaller risk of catching COVID-19. Adherence was associated with having received help from someone outside your household. Results should be taken with caution as there was no evidence for associations when controlling for multiple analyses. Of people reporting no symptoms in the household, 24.5% had gone out shopping for non-essentials in the last week (defined as non-adherent). Factors associated with non-adherence and with a higher total number of outings in the last week included decreased perceived effectiveness of Government """"lockdown"""" measures, decreased perceived severity of COVID-19, and decreased estimates of how many other people were following lockdown rules. Having received help was associated with better adherence.

ConclusionsAdherence to self-isolation is poor. As we move into a new phase of contact tracing and self-isolation, it is essential that adherence is improved. Communications should aim to increase knowledge about actions to take when symptomatic or if you have been in contact with a possible COVID-19 case. They should also emphasise the risk of catching and spreading COVID-19 when out and about and the effectiveness of preventative measures. Using volunteer networks effectively to support people in isolation may promote adherence.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe UK Government introduced """"lockdown"""" measures, including physical or  social distancing, on 23rd March 2020 due to COVID-19.
C_LIO_LIGovernment guidance states that people with symptoms of COVID-19 should not leave their home, also known as self-isolation.
C_LIO_LIThere is no research investigating adherence to self-isolation and lockdown measures, or factors associated with self-isolation or lockdown measures in the UK.

19455,Indicators of past COVID-19 infection status: Findings from a large occupational cohort of staff and postgraduate research students from a UK university,"Background Definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 requires resources frequently restricted to the severely ill. Cohort studies must rely on surrogate indicators to define cases of COVID-19 in the community. We describe the prevalence and overlap of potential indicators including self-reported symptoms, suspicion, and routine test results, plus home antibody testing. Methods An occupational cohort of 2807 staff and postgraduate students at a large London university. Repeated surveys covering March to June 2020. Antibody test results from 'lateral flow' IgG/IgM cassettes in June 2020. Results 1882 participants had valid antibody test results, and 124 (7%) were positive. Core symptoms of COVID-19 were common (770 participants positive, 41%), although fewer met criteria on a symptom algorithm (n=297, 16%). Suspicion of COVID-19 (n=509, 27%) was much higher than positive external tests (n=39, 2%). Positive antibody tests were rare in people who had no suspicion (n=4, 1%) or no core symptoms (n=10, 2%). In those who reported external antibody tests, 15% were positive on the study antibody test, compared with 24% on earlier external antibody tests. Discussion Our results demonstrate the agreement between different COVID indicators. Antibody testing using lateral flow devices at home can detect asymptomatic cases and provide greater certainty to self-report; but due to weak and waning antibody responses to mild infection, may under-ascertain. Multiple indicators used in combination can provide a more complete story than one used alone. Cohort studies need to consider how they deal with different, sometimes conflicting, indicators of COVID-19 illness to understand its long-term outcomes.","Davis, K. A.

13064,Rapid systematic review of the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing on saliva compared to nasopharyngeal swabs,"BackgroundNasopharyngeal sampling has been the standard collection method for COVID-19 testing. Due to its invasive nature and risk of contamination for health care workers who collect the sample, non-invasive and safe sampling methods like saliva, can be used alternatively.

MethodsA rapid systematic search was performed in PubMed and medRxiv, with the last retrieval on June 6th, 2020. Studies were included if they compared saliva with nasopharyngeal sampling for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the same RT-qPCR applied on both types of samples. The primary outcome of interest was the relative sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing on saliva versus nasopharyngeal samples (used as the comparator test). A secondary outcome was the proportion of nasopharyngeal-positive patients that tested also positive on a saliva sample.

ResultsEight studies were included comprising 1070 saliva-nasopharyngeal sample pairs allowing assessment of the first outcome. The relative sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing on saliva versus nasopharyngeal samples was 0.97 (95% CI=0.92-1.02). The second outcome incorporated patient data (n=257) from four other studies (n=97 patients) pooled with four studies from the first outcome (n=160 patients). This resulted in a pooled proportion of nasopharyngeal positive cases that was also positive on saliva of 86% (95% CI=77-93%).

DiscussionSaliva could potentially be considered as an alternative sampling method when compared to nasopharyngeal swabs. However, studies included in this review often were small and involved inclusion of subjects with insufficient information on clinical covariates. Most studies included patients who were symptomatic (78%, 911/1167). Therefore, additional and larger studies should be performed to verify the relative performance of saliva in the context of screening of asymptomatic populations and contact-tracing.","Peeters, E.; Kaur Dhillon Ajit Singh, S.; Vandesompele, J.; Mestdagh, P.; Hutse, V.; Arbyn, M.",2020-08-06,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.05.20168716,1,Marc Arbyn,Sciensano,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168716v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168716v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
27200,How immunity from and interaction with seasonal coronaviruses can shape SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology,"We hypothesised that cross-protection from seasonal epidemics of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) could have affected SARS-CoV-2 transmission, including generating reduced susceptibility in children. To determine what the pre-pandemic distribution of immunity to HCoVs was, we fitted a mathematical model to 6 years of seasonal coronavirus surveillance data from England and Wales. We estimated a duration of immunity to seasonal HCoVs of 7.3 years (95%CI 6.8 - 7.9) and show that, while cross-protection between HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the age distribution, it is insufficient to explain the age pattern of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the first wave of the pandemic in England and Wales. Projections from our model illustrate how different strengths of cross-protection between circulating coronaviruses could determine the frequency and magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics over the coming decade, as well as the potential impact of cross-protection on future seasonal coronavirus transmission.

Significance statementCross-protection from seasonal epidemics of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) has been hypothesised to contribute to the relative sparing of children during the early phase of the pandemic. Testing this relies on understanding the pre-pandemic age-distribution of recent HCoV infections, but little is known about their dynamics. Using England and Wales as a case study, we use a transmission model to estimate the duration of immunity to seasonal coronaviruses, and show how cross-protection could have affected the age distribution of susceptibility during the first wave, and alter SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns over the coming decade.","Waterlow, N.

6330,The prevalence of common and stress-related mental health disorders in healthcare workers based in pandemic-affected hospitals: a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundHealthcare workers (HCWs) are considered at elevated risk of experiencing mental health disorders in working with patients with COVID-19.

AimsTo estimate the prevalence of common mental health disorders in HCWs based in hospitals where pandemic-affected patients were treated.

MethodDatabases were searched for studies published before 30th March 2020. Quantitative synthesis was used to obtain estimates of the prevalence of mental health disorders in four time windows, determined a priori (the acute phase, i.e. during and up to 1.5 months post-pandemic; 1.5-5.9 months; 6-11.9 months; 12 months and later).

ResultsNineteen studies met the review criteria. They predominantly addressed the acute phase of the SARS outbreak in Asia. The most studied outcomes were clinically-significant post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and general psychiatric caseness. For clinically significant PTSS in the acute phase, the prevalence estimate was 23.4% (95% CI 16.3, 31.2; N=4147; I2=96.2%); in the 12 months plus window, the estimate was 11.9% (8.4, 15.8; N=1136; I2=74.3%). For general psychiatric caseness, prevalence estimates were: acute phase, 34.1% (18.7, 51.4; N=3971; I2=99.1%); 6-12 months, 17.9% (13.1, 23.2; N=223; I2=0.0%); 12 months plus, 29.3% (6.0, 61.0; N=710; I2=97.8%).

ConclusionsMental health disorders are particularly common in HCWs working with pandemic-afflicted patients immediately following a pandemic, but the course of disorders following this period is poorly understood. PTSS remained elevated compared to the general population at 12 months, despite there being some evidence for natural recovery. There was considerable heterogeneity, likely linked to methodological differences. More extended follow up of HCWs is needed.","Allan, S.

Unfortunately, the infection numbers and deaths are still increasing rapidly which has put the world on the catastrophic abyss edge. Application of artificial intelligence and spatiotemporal distribution techniques can play a key role to infection forecasting in national and province levels in many countries. As methodology, the presented study employs long short-term memory-based deep for time series forecasting, the confirmed cases in both national and province levels, in Iran. The data were collected from February 19, to March 22, 2020 in provincial level and from February 19, to May 13, 2020 in national level by nationally recognised sources.

28023,Mild Adverse Events of Sputnik V Vaccine Extracted from Russian Language Telegram Posts via BERT Deep Learning Model,"BackgroundThere is a limited amount of data on the COVID-19 vector vaccine Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V) safety profile. Previous infodemiology studies showed that social media discourse could be analyzed to assess the most concerning adverse events (AE) caused by drugs.

ObjectiveWe aimed to investigate mild AEs of Sputnik V based on a participatory trial conducted on Telegram in the Russian language. We compared AEs extracted from Telegram with other limited databases on Sputnik V and other COVID-19 vaccines. We explored symptom co-occurrence patterns and determined how counts of administered doses, age, gender, and sequence of shots could confound the reporting of AEs.

Materials and MethodsWe collected a unique dataset consisting of 11,515 self-reported Sputnik V vaccine AEs posted on the Telegram group, and we utilized natural language processing methods to extract AEs. Specifically, we performed multi-label classifications using the deep neural language model BERT """"DeepPavlov"""", which we pre-trained on a Russian language corpus and applied to the Telegram messages. The resulting AUC score was 0.991. We chose symptom classes that represented the following AEs: fever, pain, chills, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, headache, insomnia, lymph node enlargement, erythema, pruritus, swelling, and diarrhea.

ResultsThe results of the retrospective analysis showed that females reported more AEs than males (1.2-fold, P<.001). In addition, there were more AEs from the first dose than from the second dose (1.13-fold, P<.001), and the number of AEs decreased with age ({beta} = .05 per year, P<.001). The results also showed that Sputnik V AEs were more similar to other vector vaccines (132 units) compared with mRNA ones (241 units) according to the average Euclidean distance between the vectors of AE frequencies. Elderly Telegram users reported significantly more (5.6-fold on average) systemic AEs than their peers, according to the results of the phase III clinical trials published in The Lancet. However, the AEs reported in Telegram posts were consistent (Pearson correlation r=.94, P=.02) with those reported in the Argentinian post-marketing AE registry.

ConclusionAfter receiving the Sputnik V vaccination, Telegram users complained about pain (47%), fever (47%), fatigue (34%), and headache (25%). The results showed that the AE profile of Sputnik V was comparable with other COVID-19 vaccines. Examining the sentinel properties of participatory trials (which is subject to self-reporting biases) could still provide meaningful information about pharmaceutics, especially if only a limited amount of information on AEs is provided by producers.","Jarynowski, A.; Semenov, A.; Kaminski, M.; Belik, V.",2021-06-22,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.06.14.21258875,1,Andrzej Jarynowski,Interdisciplinary Research Institute in Wroclaw,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.14.21258875v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.14.21258875v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

Estimating the impact of French municipal elections on COVID-19 spread in France","On March 15, about 20, 000, 000 voters cast their vote for the first round of the 2020 French municipal elections. We investigate the extent to which this event contributed to the COVID-19 epidemics in France. To this end, we first predict each departements own dynamics using information up to the election to calibrate a standard logistic model. We then take advantage of electoral turnout differences between departements to distinguish the impact of the election on prediction errors in hospitalizations from that of simultaneously implemented anti-contagion policies. We report a detrimental effect of the election in locations that were at relatively advanced stages of the epidemics by the time of the election. In contrast, we show that the election did not contribute to the epidemics in departements with lower infection levels by March 15. All in all, our estimates suggest that elections accounted for about 4, 000 excess hospitalizations by the end of March, which represents 15% of all hospitalizations by this time. They also suggest that holding elections in June may not be as detrimental.","Cassan, G.; Sangnier, M.",2020-06-25,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.06.24.20138990,1,Guilhem Cassan,University of Namur,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.20138990v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.20138990v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
7290,Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Sex-Specific COVID-19 Clinical Outcomes,"To successfully mitigate the extraordinary devastation caused by the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is crucial to identify important risk factors for this disease. One such neglected health determinant is the sex of the patient. This is an essential clinical characteristic, as it can factor into a patients clinical management and preventative measures. Some clinical studies have shown disparities in the proportion between males and females that have more severe clinical outcomes or, subsequently, die from this disease. However, this association has not been unequivocally established. Thus, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the association between male sex and COVID-19 severity. We systematically reviewed the literature, identified non-randomized studies that matched predetermined selection criteria, and performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the proportion of males among four disease severity categories. Appropriate assessment strategies were implemented to assess and minimize potential biases. The results of this meta-analysis indicated that males constituted a significantly higher proportion of those who had adverse clinical outcomes and died from COVID-19. As the coronavirus spread from the East to the West, male sex remained a consistent risk factor. Our results support the establishment of the male sex as an important risk factor for this disease. Early identification and appropriate medical care for males with lab-confirmed COVID-19 may substantially change the course of clinical prognosis, resulting in greater numbers of lives saved.","Galbadage, T.; Peterson, B.

The study investigates the prevalence and predictors of general psychiatric disorders measured by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and frequency of loneliness during COVID-19 in the United Kingdom, a country heavily hit by the pandemic. We analyzed 15,530 respondents of the first large-scale, nationally representative survey of COVID-19 in a developed country, the first wave of Understanding Society COVID-19 Study. Results show that 29.2% of the respondents score 4 or more, the caseness threshold, on the general psychiatric disorder measure, and 35.86% of the respondents sometimes or often feel lonely. Regression analyses show that those who have or had COVID-19-related symptoms are more likely to develop general psychiatric disorders and are lonelier. Women and people in their 20s have higher risks of general psychiatric disorders and loneliness, while having a job and living with a partner are protective factors. This study showcases the general psychiatric disorders and loneliness of broader members of the society during COVID-19 and the underlying social disparities.","Li, L.

13300,"SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence survey among 18,000 healthcare and administrative personnel at hospitals, pre-hospital services, and specialist practitioners in the Central Denmark Region","ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to perform a large seroprevalence survey on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among Danish healthcare workers to identify high risk groups.

DesignCross-sectional survey.

SettingAll healthcare workers and administrative personnel at the seven hospitals, pre-hospital services and specialist practitioner clinics in the Central Denmark Region were invited by e-mail to be tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by a commercial SARS-CoV-2 total antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co., Ltd., Beijing, China).

ParticipantsA total of 25,950 participants were invited. Of these, 17,987 (69%) showed up for blood sampling, and 17,971 had samples available for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing.

Main outcome measures1) Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; 2) Risk factors for seropositivity; 3) Association of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies.

ResultsAfter adjustment for assay sensitivity and specificity, the overall seroprevalence was 3.4% (CI: 2.5%-3.8%). The seroprevalence was higher in the western part of the region than in the eastern part (11.9% vs 1.2%, difference: 10.7 percentage points, CI: 9.5-12.2). In the high prevalence area, the emergency departments had the highest seroprevalence (29.7%) while departments without patients or with limited patient contact had the lowest seroprevalence (2.2%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis with age, sex, and profession as the predictors showed that nursing staff, medical doctors, and biomedical laboratory scientists had a higher risk than medical secretaries, who served as reference (OR = 7.3, CI: 3.5-14.9; OR = 4., CI: 1.8-8.9; and OR = 5.0, CI: 2.1-11.6, respectively).

Among the total 668 seropositive participants, 433 (64.8%) had previously been tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and 50.0% had a positive RT-PCR result. A total of 98% of individuals who had a previous positive viral RNA test were also found to be seropositive.

ConclusionsWe found large differences in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in staff working in the healthcare sector within a small geographical area of Denmark and signs of in-hospital transmission. Half of all seropositive staff had been tested positive by PCR prior to this survey. This study raises awareness of precautions which should be taken to avoid in-hospital transmission. Additionally, regular testing of healthcare workers for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered to identify areas with increased transmission.

The timely prediction of the medical needs of infected individuals enables a better and quicker care provision for the necessary cases, supporting the management of available resources.

This work ascertains the predictability of medical needs (as hospitalization, respiratory support, and admission to intensive care units) and the survivability of individuals testing SARS-CoV-2 positive considering a cohort with all infected individuals in Portugal as per June 30, 2020. Predictions are performed at the various stages of a patients cycle, namely: pre-hospitalization (testing time), pos-hospitalization, and pos-intensive care.

20349,Quantifying the online news media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic.,"BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns, mask wearing and social distancing have been the primary measures to effectively combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Such measures are highly effective when there is strong population wide adherence which needs to be facilitated by information on the current risks posed by the pandemic alongside a clear exposition of the rules and guidelines in place. Here we address the issue of communication on the pandemic by offering data and analysis of online news media coverage of COVID-19.

MethodsWe collected 26 million news articles from the front pages of 172 major online news sources in 11 countries (available at http://sciride.org). Using topic detection we identified COVID-19-related content to quantify the proportion of total coverage pandemic received in 2020. Sentiment analysis tool Vader was employed to stratify the emotional polarity of COVID-19 reporting. Further topic detection and sentiment analysis was performed on COVID-19 articles to reveal the leading themes in pandemic reporting and their respective emotional polarizations.

FindingsWe find that COVID-19 coverage accounted for approximately 25% of all front-page online news articles between January and October 2020. Sentiment analysis of English-speaking sources reveals that the overall COVID-19 coverage cannot be simply classified as negative due to the disease subject matter, suggesting a wide heterogeneous reporting of the pandemic. Within this heterogenous coverage, 16% of COVID-19 news articles (or 4% of all English-speaking articles) can be classified as highly negatively polarized, citing issues such as death, fear or crisis.

InterpretationThe goal of pandemic public health communication is to increase understanding of distancing rules and maximize the impact of any governmental policy. Our results suggest an information overload in COVID-19 reporting that could risk obscuring effective policy communication. We hope that our data and analysis will inform health communication strategy to minimize the risks of COVID-19 while vaccination regimes are being introduced.","Krawczyk, K.; Chelkowski, T.; Mishra, S.; Xifara, D.; Gibert, B.; Laydon, D.

24487,Regional performance variation in external validation of four prediction models for severity of COVID-19 at hospital admission: An observational multi-centre cohort study,"BackgroundSeveral prediction models for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) have been published. Prediction models should be externally validated to assess their performance before implementation. This observational cohort study aimed to validate published models of severity for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 using clinical and laboratory predictors.

MethodsPrediction models fitting relevant inclusion criteria were chosen for validation. The outcome was either mortality or a composite outcome of mortality and ICU admission (severe disease). 1295 patients admitted with symptoms of COVID-19 at Kings Cross Hospital (KCH) in London, United Kingdom, and 307 patients at Oslo University Hospital (OUH) in Oslo, Norway were included. The performance of the models was assessed in terms of discrimination and calibration.

ResultsWe identified two models for prediction of mortality (referred to as Xie and Zhang1) and two models for prediction of severe disease (Allenbach and Zhang2).

The performance of the models was variable. For prediction of mortality Xie had good discrimination at OUH with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) 0.87 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.79-0.95] and acceptable discrimination at KCH, AUROC 0.79 [0.76-0.82]. In prediction of severe disease, Allenbach had acceptable discrimination (OUH AUROC 0.81 [0.74-0.88] and KCH AUROC 0.72 [0.68-0.75]). The Zhang models had moderate to poor discrimination. Initial calibration was poor for all models but improved with recalibration.

20906,"Determining the optimal COVID-19 policy response using agent-based modelling linked to health and cost modelling: Case study for Victoria, Australia","ImportanceDetermining the best policy on social restrictions and lockdowns for the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging.

ObjectiveTo determine the optimal policy response ranging from aggressive and moderate elimination, tight suppression (aiming for 1 to 5 cases per million per day) and loose suppression (5 to 25 cases per million per day).

DesignTwo simulation models in series: an agent-based model to estimate daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and time in four stages of social restrictions; a proportional multistate lifetable model to estimate long-run health impacts (health adjusted life years (HALYs) arising from SARS-CoV-2) and costs (health systems, and health system plus GDP).

The net monetary benefit (NMB) of each policy option at varying willingness to pay (WTP) per HALY was calculated: NMB = HALYs x WTP - cost. The optimal policy response was that with the highest NMB.

Setting and participantsThe State of Victoria, Australia, using simulation modeling of all residents.

Main Outcome and MeasuresSARS-CoV-2 infection rates, time under various stages of restrictions, HALYs, health expenditure and GDP losses.

ResultsAggressive elimination resulted in the highest percentage of days with the lowest level of restrictions (median 31.7%, 90% simulation interval 6.6% to 64.4%). However, days in hard lockdown were similar across all four strategies (medians 27.5% to 36.1%).

HALY losses (compared to a no-COVID-19 scenario) were similar for aggressive elimination (286, 219 to 389) and moderate elimination (314, 228 to 413), and nearly eight and 40-times higher for tight and loose suppression. The median GDP loss was least for moderate elimination ($US41.7 billion, $29.0 to $63.6 billion), but there was substantial overlap in simulation intervals between the four strategies.

From a health system perspective aggressive elimination was optimal in 64% of simulations above a willingness to pay of $15,000 per HALY, followed by moderate elimination in 35% of simulations.

Moderate elimination was optimal from a partial societal perspective in half the simulations followed by aggressive elimination in a quarter.

Shortening the pandemic duration to 6 months saw loose suppression become preferable under a partial societal perspective.

Conclusions and RelevanceElimination strategies were preferable over a 1-year pandemic duration.

The prevalence of viral sepsis among COVID-19 patients is still unclear.

ObjectiveWe aimed to describe this in a systematic review.

Data sourcesMEDLINE(PubMed), Cochrane and Google Scholar databases were searched for studies reporting on patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19, diagnosed with sepsis or infection-related organ dysfunctions or receiving organ replacement therapy.

Study selectionEligible were full-text English articles of randomized and non-randomized clinical trials and observational studies reporting on patients with confirmed COVID-19, who are diagnosed with sepsis or have infection-related organ dysfunctions. Systematic reviews, editorials, conference abstracts, animal studies, case reports, articles neither in English nor full-text, and studies with fewer than 30 participants were excluded.

Data extraction and synthesisAll eligible studies were included in a narrative synthesis of results and after reviewing all included studies a meta-analysis was conducted. Separate sensitivity analyses were conducted per adult vs pediatric populations and per Intensive Care Unit (ICU) vs non-ICU populations.

Main outcomes and measuresPrimary endpoint was the prevalence of sepsis using Sepsis-3 criteria among patients with COVID-19 and among secondary, new onset of infection-related organ dysfunction. Outcomes were expressed as proportions with respective 95% confidence interval (CI).

ResultsOf 1,903 articles, 104 were analyzed. The prevalence of sepsis in COVID-19 was 39.9% (95% CI, 35.9-44.1; I2, 99%). In sensitivity analysis, sepsis was present in 25.1% (95% CI, 21.8-28.9; I2 99%) of adult patients hospitalized in non-Intensive-Care-Unit (ICU) wards (40 studies) and in 83.8 (95% CI, 78.1-88.2; I2,91%) of adult patients hospitalized in the ICU (31 studies). Sepsis in children hospitalized with COVID-19 was as high as 7.8% (95% CI, 0.4-64.9; I2, 97%). Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome was the most common organ dysfunction in adult patients in non-ICU (27.6; 95% CI, 21.6-34.5; I2, 99%) and ICU (88.3%; 95% CI, 79.7-93.5; I2, 97%)

Conclusions and relevanceDespite the high heterogeneity in reported results, sepsis frequently complicates COVID-19 among hospitalized patients and is significantly higher among those in the ICU. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020202018. No funding.

17836,Benefits and risks of zinc for adults during covid-19: rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.,"ObjectiveTo evaluate the benefits and risks of any type of zinc intervention to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2.

DesignA living, systematic review and meta-analysis, incorporating rapid review methods.

Data sources17 English and Chinese databases and clinical trial registries were searched in April/May 2020, with additional covid-19 focused searches in June and August 2020.

Eligibilitycriteria and analysisRandomized control trials (RCTs) published in any language comparing zinc to a control to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2. Other viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs) were included, but the certainty of evidence downgraded twice for indirectness. Screening, data extraction, risk of bias appraisal (RoB-2 tool) and verification was performed by calibrated, single reviewers. RCTs with adult populations were prioritised for analysis.

Results123 RCTs were identified. None were specific to SARS-CoV-2 nor other coronaviruses. 28 RCTs evaluated oral (15-45mg daily), sublingual (45-300mg daily), or topical nasal (0.09-2.6 mg daily) zinc to prevent or treat nonspecific viral RTIs in 3,597 adults without zinc deficiency. Compared to placebo, zinc prevented 5 mild to moderate RTIs per 100 person-months, including in older adults (95% confidence interval 1 to 9) (number needed to treat (NTT)=20). There was no significant difference in the rates of non-serious adverse events (AE). For RTI treatment, a clinically important reduction in peak symptom severity scores was found for zinc compared to placebo (mean difference 1.2 points, 0.7 to 1.7), but not average daily symptom severity (standardised mean difference 0.2, 0.1 to 0.4). 19 fewer per 100 adults were at risk of remaining symptomatic over the first 7 days (2 to 38, NNT=5) and the mean duration of symptoms was 2 days shorter (0.2 to 3.5), however, there was substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 82% and 97%). 14 more per 100 experienced a non-serious AE (4 to 16, NNT=7) such as nausea, or mouth or nasal irritation. No differences in illness duration nor AE were found when zinc was compared to active controls. No serious AE, including copper deficiency, were reported by any RCT. Quality of life outcomes were not assessed. Confidence in these findings for SARS-CoV-2 is very low due to serious indirectness and some concerns about bias for most outcomes.

ConclusionsZinc is a potential therapeutic candidate for preventing and treating SARS-CoV-2, including older adults and adults without zinc deficiency (very low certainty). Zinc may also help to prevent other viral RTIs during the pandemic (moderate certainty) and reduce the severity and duration of symptoms (very low certainty). The pending results from seven RCTs evaluating zinc for SARS-CoV-2 will be tracked.

4969,Mortality from COVID-19 in 12 countries and 6 states of the United States,"ImportanceReliable estimates of COVID-19 mortality are crucial to aid control strategies and to assess the effectiveness of interventions.

ObjectiveProject COVID-19 mortality trends to October 1, 2020, in 12 countries or regions that constitute >90% of the global COVID-19 deaths reported as of April 12, 2020.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThe Global COVID-19 Assessment of Mortality (GCAM) is an open, transparent, and continuously updated (www.cghr.org/covid) statistical model that combines actual COVID-19 mortality counts with Bayesian inference to forecast COVID-19 deaths, the date of peak deaths, and the duration of excess mortality. The analyses covered a total of 700 million population above age 20 in 12 countries or regions: USA; Italy; Spain; France; UK; Iran; Belgium; a province of China (Hubei, which accounted for 90% of reported Chinese deaths); Germany; the Netherlands; Switzerland; and Canada; and six US states: New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Louisiana, California, and Washington.

ResultsForecasted deaths across the 12 current high-burden countries sum 167,000 to 593,000 (median 253,000). The trajectory of US deaths (49,000-249,000 deaths; median 86,000)--over half of which are expected in states beyond the initial six states analysed in this study--will have the greatest impact on the eventual total. Mortality ranges are 25,000-109,000 (median 46,000) in the UK; 23,000-31,000 (median 26,000) in Italy; 21,000-37,000 (median 26,000) in France and 21,000-32,000 (median 25,000) in Spain. Estimates are most precise for Hubei, China--where the epidemic curve is complete--and least precise in California, where it is ongoing. New York has the highest cumulative median mortality rate per million (1135), about 12-fold that of Germany. Mortality trajectories are notably flatter in Germany, California, and Washington State, each of which took physical distancing and testing strategies seriously. Using past country-specific mortality as a guide, GCAM predicts surge capacity needs, reaching more than twice existing capacity in a number of places., In every setting, the results might be sensitive to undercounts of COVID-19 deaths, which are already apparent.

Conclusion and RelevanceMortality from COVID-19 will be substantial across many settings, even in the best case scenario. GCAM will provide continually updated and increasingly precise estimates as the pandemic progresses.

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has already caused over 115,000 deaths, with global deaths doubling every week.1-3 Mortality is less biased than case reporting, which is affected by testing policies. However, the daily reporting of COVID-19 deaths is already known to undercount actual deaths, varying over time and place.4-6

Reliable estimates of total COVID-19 mortality, the date of peak deaths, and of the duration of excess mortality are crucial to aid responses to the current and potential future pandemics. We have developed the Global COVID-19 Assessment of Mortality (GCAM), a statistical model to project COVID-19 mortality trends to October 1 2020 in 12 countries or regions that constitute >90% of the global COVID-19 deaths reported as of April 12th. We report also on six US states that account for 70% of the American totals to date (Supplementary Appendix).1 We quantify the COVID-19 mortality trajectory ranges in each setting. A semi-automated website (www.cghr.org/covid) provides daily updates. GCAM is open, transparent, and uses a reasonably simple method that employs publicly reported mortality data to make plausible projections. The method is designed to improve as more mortality data become available over longer time periods.","Brown, P.; Jha, P.; Cghr Covid Mortality Consortium,  ",2020-04-22,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.17.20069161,1,Prabhat Jha,University of Toronto,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069161v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069161v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
6989,COVID-19: Easing the coronavirus lockdowns with caution,"BackgroundThe spread of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has reached a global level, creating a pandemic. The government of various countries, their citizens, politicians, and business owners are worried about the unavoidable economic impacts of this pandemic. Therefore, there is an eagerness for the pandemic peaking.

ObjectivesThis study uses an objective approach to emphasize the need to be pragmatic with easing of lockdowns measures worldwide through the forecast of the possible trend of COVID-19. This is necessary to ensure that the enthusiasm about SARS-CoV-2 peaking is properly examined, easing of lockdown is done systematically to avoid second-wave of the pandemic.

MethodsWe used the Facebook prophet on the World Health Organization data for COVID-19 to forecast the spread of SARS-CoV-2 for the 7th April until 3rd May 2020. The forecast model was further used to forecast the trend of the virus for the 8th until 14th May 2020. We presented the forecast of the confirmed and death cases.

ResultsOur findings from the forecast showed an increase in the number of new cases for this period. Therefore, the need for easing the lockdown with caution becomes imperative. Our model showed good performance when compared to the official report from the World Health Organization. The average forecasting accuracy of our model was 79.6%.

ConclusionAlthough, the global and economic impact of COVID-19 is daunting. However, excessive optimism about easing the lockdown should be appropriately weighed against the risk of underestimating its spread. As seen globally, the risks appeared far from being symmetric. Therefore, the forecasting provided in this study offers an insight into the spread of the virus for effective planning and decision-making in terms of easing the lockdowns in various countries.","Alabi, R.

26318,Cross-sectional study of the association between perceived organizational support and COVID-19 vaccine intention,"ObjectivesThis study examined the association between perceived organizational support (POS) and COVID-19 vaccine intention and the influence of the implementation of workplace infection prevention measures.

MethodsWe analyzed 23,846 workers using data from an Internet survey of workers aged 20-65 years conducted in December 2020, during a period of widespread COVID-19 infection in Japan.

ResultsA higher POS was associated with a higher intention to vaccinate. The relationship between POS and vaccine intention was attenuated when adjusted for infection prevention measures in the workplace.

ConclusionsIn workplaces where POS is present, a sense of responsibility to the group and altruistic behavior may arise. This means employees act to acquire herd immunity to protect others, which may result in increased vaccine intention. The association between POS and vaccination intention was attenuated by adjusting for workplace infection prevention measures, which suggested that infection prevention measures may be a confounding factor or that POS created a health climate that promoted infection prevention measures. The results suggest that working to improve employee well-being and implementing appropriate workplace infection prevention measures during infectious disease outbreaks may promote vaccination behavior and contribute to the acquisition of herd immunity in the community.","Kobayashi, Y.; Nagata, T.; Fujino, Y.; Hino, A.; Tateishi, S.; Ogami, A.; Tsuji, M.; Matsuda, S.; Mori, K.",2021-05-10,Occupational And Environmental Health,10.1101/2021.05.07.21256839,1,Tomohisa Nagata,"University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.07.21256839v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.07.21256839v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
21013,Real-Time Electronic Health Record Mortality Prediction During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Prospective Cohort Study,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected millions of people, overwhelming critical care resources in some regions. Many plans for rationing critical care resources during crises are based on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. The COVID-19 pandemic created an emergent need to develop and validate a novel electronic health record (EHR)-computable tool to predict mortality.

Research QuestionsTo rapidly develop, validate, and implement a novel real-time mortality score for the COVID-19 pandemic that improves upon SOFA.

Study Design and MethodsWe conducted a prospective cohort study of a regional health system with 12 hospitals in Colorado between March 2020 and July 2020. All patients >14 years old hospitalized during the study period without a do not resuscitate order were included. Patients were stratified by the diagnosis of COVID-19. From this cohort, we developed and validated a model using stacked generalization to predict mortality using data widely available in the EHR by combining five previously validated scores and additional novel variables reported to be associated with COVID-19-specific mortality. We compared the area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) for the new model to the SOFA score and the Charlson Comorbidity Index.

ResultsWe prospectively analyzed 27,296 encounters, of which 1,358 (5.0%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 4,494 (16.5%) included intensive care unit (ICU)-level care, 1,480 (5.4%) included invasive mechanical ventilation, and 717 (2.6%) ended in death. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and SOFA scores predicted overall mortality with an AUROC of 0.72 and 0.90, respectively. Our novel score predicted overall mortality with AUROC 0.94. In the subset of patients with COVID-19, we predicted mortality with AUROC 0.90, whereas SOFA had AUROC of 0.85.

InterpretationWe developed and validated an accurate, in-hospital mortality prediction score in a live EHR for automatic and continuous calculation using a novel model, that improved upon SOFA.

Take Home PointsO_ST_ABSStudy QuestionC_ST_ABSCan we improve upon the SOFA score for real-time mortality prediction during the COVID-19 pandemic by leveraging electronic health record (EHR) data?

ResultsWe rapidly developed and implemented a novel yet SOFA-anchored mortality model across 12 hospitals and conducted a prospective cohort study of 27,296 adult hospitalizations, 1,358 (5.0%) of which were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and SOFA scores predicted all-cause mortality with AUROCs of 0.72 and 0.90, respectively. Our novel score predicted mortality with AUROC 0.94.

InterpretationA novel EHR-based mortality score can be rapidly implemented to better predict patient outcomes during an evolving pandemic.","Sottile, P. D.; Albers, D. J.; Dewitt, P.

5758,Determining the source of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a healthcare worker,"BackgroundHealthcare workers (HCWs) are at the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic and are at risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection from their interactions with patients and in the community (1, 2). Limited availability of recommended personal protective equipment (PPE), in particular N95 respirators, has fueled concerns about whether HCWs are adequately protected from exposure while caring for patients. Understanding the source of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a HCW - the community or the healthcare system - is critical for understanding the effectiveness of hospital infection control and PPE practices. In Dane County, Wisconsin, community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is relatively low (cumulative prevalence of ~0.06% - positive cases / total population in Dane county as of April 17). Although SARS-CoV-2 infections in HCWs are often presumed to be acquired during the course of patient care, there are few reports unambiguously identifying the source of acquisition.

ObjectiveTo determine the source of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a healthcare worker.","Safdar, N.; Moreno, G. K.; Braun, K. M.; Friedrich, T. C.; O'connor, D.

11054,Daily viral kinetics and innate and adaptive immune responses assessment in COVID-19: a case series,"BackgroundViral shedding patterns and its correlation with the immune responses of mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients are still poorly characterized.

MethodsWe enrolled the first five COVID-19 patients quarantined in our institution; none received immunomodulatory treatment. We monitored shedding of viral RNA and infectious virus by RT-PCR and cell culture from the upper respiratory tract, and characterized the kinetics of systemic innate and adaptive immune responses.

ResultsDespite mild clinical disease, high viral loads and shedding of infectious virus were observed from the respiratory tract, with isolation of infectious virus and prolonged positivity by PCR up to day 7 and 19 post onset of symptoms, respectively. Robust innate responses characterized by an increase in activated CD14+CD16+ monocytes and cytokine responses were observed as early as 2 days after symptoms onset. Cellular and humoral SARS-CoV-2 specific adaptive responses were detectable in all patients.

ConclusionInfectious virus shedding was limited to the first week of symptom onset in mild cases. A strong innate response, characterized by the mobilization of activated monocytes during the first days of infection, as well as SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were detectable, even in patients with mild disease.

SummaryWe describe viral and immune profiles of the first five SARS-CoV-2 patients in our institution, showing high viral loads and infectious viral shedding in early acute disease. Mild patients mount an innate response sufficient for viral control and specific immunity.","Vetter, P.; Eberhardt, C.; Meyer, B.; Martinez, P.; Torriani, G.; Pigny, F.; Lemeille, S.; Cordey, S.; Laubscher, F.; Vu, D.-L.; Calame, A.; Schibler, M.; Jacquerioz, F.; Blanchard, G.; Siegrist, C.-A.; Kaiser, L.; Didierlaurent, A.; Eckerle, I.",2020-07-06,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.07.02.20143271,1,Pauline Vetter,Geneva University Hospitals,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20143271v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20143271v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1128/mSphere.00827-20
22908,Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccine in Pakistan Among Health Care Workers,"ObjectiveAcceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine will impart a pivotal role in eradicating the virus. In Pakistan, health care workers (HCWs) are the first group to receive vaccination. This survey aimed at the level of acceptance to the COVID-19 vaccine and predictors of non-acceptance in HCWs.

MethodThis was a cross-sectional study design and data were collected through 3rd December 2020 and February 14th, 2021. An English questionnaire was distributed through social media platforms and administration of affiliate hospitals along with snowball sampling for private hospitals.

ResultsOut of 5,237 responses, 3,679 (70.2%) accepted COVID-19 vaccination and 1,284 (24.5%) wanted to delay until more data was available. Only 5.2% of HCWs rejected being vaccinated. Vaccine acceptance was more in young (76%) and female gender (63.3%) who worked in a tertiary care hospital (51.2%) and were direct patient care providers (61.3%). The reason for rejection in females was doubtful vaccine effectiveness (31.48%) while males rejected due to prior COVID-19 exposure (42.19%) and side effect profile of the vaccine (33.17%). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated age between 51-60 years, female gender, Pashtuns, those working in the specialty of medicine and allied, taking direct care of COVID-19 patients, higher education, and prior OCVID-19 infection as the predictors for acceptance or rejection of COVID-19 vaccine.

18053,"Design and implementation of an international, multi-arm, multi-stage platform master protocol for trials of novel SARS-CoV-2 antiviral agents: Therapeutics for Inpatients with COVID-19 (TICO/ACTIV-3)","BackgroundSafe and effective therapies for COVID-19 are urgently needed. In order to meet this need, the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) public-private partnership initiated the Therapeutics for Inpatients with COVID-19 (TICO). TICO is a multi-arm, multi-stage (MAMS) platform master protocol, which facilitates the rapid evaluation of the safety and efficacy of novel candidate anti-viral therapeutic agents for adults hospitalized with COVID-19. Four agents have so far entered the protocol, with rapid answers already provided for three of these. Other agents are expected to enter the protocol throughout 2021. This protocol contains a number of key design and implementation features that, along with challenges faced by the protocol team, are presented and discussed.

Protocol Design and ImplementationThree clinical trial networks, encompassing a global network of clinical sites, participated in the protocol development and implementation. TICO utilizes a MAMS design with an agile and robust approach to futility and safety evaluation at 300 patients enrolled, with subsequent expansion to full sample size and an expanded target population if the agent shows an acceptable safety profile and evidence of efficacy. Rapid recruitment to multiple agents is enabled through the sharing of placebo as well as the confining of agent-specific information to protocol appendices, and modular consent forms. In collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration, a thorough safety data collection and DSMB schedule was developed for the study of agents with limited in-human data.

ChallengesChallenges included ensuring drug supply and reliable recruitment allowing for changing infection rates across the global network of sites, the need to balance the collection of data and samples without overburdening clinical staff, and obtaining regulatory approvals across a global network of sites.

ConclusionThrough a robust multi-network partnership, the TICO protocol has been successfully used across a global network of sites for rapid generation of efficacy data on multiple novel antiviral agents. The protocol design and implementation features used in this protocol, and the approaches to address challenges, will have broader applicability. Mechanisms to facilitate improved communication and harmonization among country-specific regulatory bodies are required.","Murray, D. D.; Babiker, A. G.; Baker, J. V.; Barkauskas, C. E.; Brown, S.

27551,Recognition and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by humoral innate immunity pattern recognition molecules,"The humoral arm of innate immunity includes diverse molecules with antibody-like functions, some of which serve as disease severity biomarkers in COVID-19. The present study was designed to conduct a systematic investigation of the interaction of humoral fluid phase pattern recognition molecules (PRM) with SARS-CoV-2. Out of 10 PRM tested, the long pentraxin PTX3 and Mannose Binding Lectin (MBL) bound the viral Nucleoprotein and Spike, respectively. MBL bound trimeric Spike, including that of variants of concern, in a glycan- dependent way and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in three in vitro models. Moreover, upon binding to Spike, MBL activated the lectin pathway of complement activation. Genetic polymorphisms at the MBL locus were associated with disease severity. These results suggest that selected humoral fluid phase PRM can play an important role in resistance to, and pathogenesis of, COVID-19, a finding with translational implications.","Stravalaci, M.; Pagani, I.; Paraboschi, E.

20805,"Efficacy of propolis as an adjunct treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients: a randomized, controlled clinical trial","Among candidate treatment options for COVID-19, propolis, produced by honey bees from bioactive plant exudates, has shown potential against viral targets and has demonstrated immunoregulatory properties. We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label, single center trial, with a standardized propolis product (EPP-AF) on hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients. Patients received standard care plus propolis at an oral dose of 400mg/day (n=40) or 800mg/day (n=42) for seven days, or standard care alone (n=42). Standard care included all necessary interventions, as determined by the attending physician. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement defined as the length of hospital stay or oxygen therapy dependency. Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury and need for intensive care or vasoactive drugs. Time in the hospital after intervention was significantly shortened in both propolis groups compared to the controls; median 7 days with 400mg/day and 6 days with 800mg/day, versus 12 days for standard care alone. Propolis did not significantly affect the need for oxygen supplementation. With the higher dose, significantly fewer patients developed acute kidney injury than in the controls (2 versus 10 of 42 patients). Propolis as an adjunct treatment was safe and reduced hospitalization time. The registration number for this clinical trial is: NCT04480593 (20/07/2020).","Silveira, M. A. D.; De Jong, D.; Galvao, E.

21924,Optimal time to return to normality: parallel use of COVID-19 vaccines and circuit breakers,"By January 2020, the COVID-19 illness has caused over two million deaths. Countries have restricted disease spread through non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., social distancing). More severe """"lockdowns"""" have also been required. Although lockdowns keep people safer from the virus, they substantially disrupt economies and individual well-being. Fortunately, vaccines are becoming available. Yet, vaccination programs may take several months to implement, requiring further time for individuals to develop immunity following inoculation. To prevent health services being overwhelmed it may be necessary to implement further lockdowns in conjunction with vaccination. Here, we investigate optimal approaches for vaccination under varying lockdown lengths and/or severities to prevent COVID-19-related deaths exceeding critical thresholds. We find increases in vaccination rate cause a disproportionately larger decrease in lockdowns: with vaccination, severe lockdowns can reduce infections by up to 89%. Notably, we include demographics, modelling three groups: vulnerable, front-line workers, and non-vulnerable. We investigate the sequence of vaccination. One counter-intuitive finding is that even though the vulnerable group is high risk, demographically, this is a small group (per person, vaccination occurs more slowly) so vaccinating this group first achieves limited gains in overall disease control. Better disease control occurs by vaccinating the non-vulnerable group with longer and/or more severe lockdowns.","Bonsall, M.; Huntingford, C.; Rawson, T.",2021-02-03,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.02.01.21250877,1,Michael Bonsall,University of Oxford,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250877v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250877v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
25790,Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 Aerosol Spread in Typical Classrooms,"Although current industry guidelines to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) have adopted a six-foot ([~]1.8m) spacing between individuals indoors, recent evidence suggests that longer range spread is also responsible for infections in public spaces. The vehicle for long-range spread is smaller droplets or particles, termed bio-aerosols, or aerosols for short, which have a large surface area to volume ratio such that aerodynamic drag is much larger than gravity forces. The aerosols remain suspended in air for extended time periods and they essentially move with air currents. Prediction of the danger to occupants in a closed room when exposed to an infected individual requires knowledge of the period of exposure and the concentration level of aerosols in the breathing zone of an occupant. To obtain an estimate of the concentration level, a common assumption is well-mixed conditions within an interior space. This is obtained from a mass balance between the level of aerosol produced by an infected individual along with the airflow rate into and out of the entire space. In this work, we use computational fluid dynamics, verified by experimental results, to explore the aerosol concentration distribution in a typical classroom for several common conditions and compare these results to the well-mixed assumption. We use a tracer gas to simulate the flow and dispersion of the aerosol-air mixture. The two ventilation systems examined, ceiling diffusers and open windows, yield average concentrations at occupant breathing level 50% greater than the well mixed case, and some scenarios yield concentrations that are 150% greater than the well mixed concentration at specific breathing-level locations. Of particular concern are two conditions: horizontal air flow from an open window in line with a row of seating and, second, an infected individual seated near a sealed cold window. For the former, conditions are improved if a baffle is placed inside the open window to direct the air toward the floor, creating a condition similar to displacement ventilation. In the latter, the cold air flowing down along the cold window recirculates aerosols back into the breathing zone. Adding window covers or a portable heater below the window surface will moderate this condition.","Rencken, G. K.; Rutherford, E.

1985,"A descriptive study of the impact of diseases control and prevention on the epidemics dynamics and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Shanghai, lessons learned for metropolis epidemics prevention","ObjectiveTo describe and evaluate the impact of diseases control and prevention on epidemics dynamics and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Shanghai.

DesignA retrospective descriptive study

SettingChina

ParticipantsEpidemiology information was collected from publicly accessible database. 265 patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Center with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled for clinical features analysis.

Main outcome measurePrevention and control measures taken by Shanghai government, epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiology data were collected. Weibull distribution, Chi-square test, Fishers exact test, t test or Mann-Whitney U test were used in statistical analysis.

ResultsCOVID-19 transmission rate within Shanghai had reduced over 99% than previous speculated, and the exponential growth has been stopped so far. Epidemic was characterized by the first stage mainly composed of imported cases and the second stage where >50% of cases were local. The incubation period was 6.4 (95% CI 5.3 to 7.6) days and the mean onset-admission interval was 5.5 days (95% CI, 5.1 to 5.9). Median time for COVID-19 progressed to severe diseases were 8.5 days (IQR: 4.8-11.0 days). By February 11th, proportion of patients being mild, moderate, severe and critically ill were 1.9%(5/265), 89.8%(238/265), 3.8%(10/265), 4.5%(12/265), respectively; 47 people in our cohort were discharged, and 1 patient died.

ConclusionStrict controlling of the transmission rate at the early stage of an epidemic in metropolis can quickly prohibit the spread of the diseases. Controlling local clusters is the key to prevent outbreaks from imported cases. Most COVID-19 severe cases progressed within 14 days of disease onset. Multiple systemic laboratory abnormalities had been observed before significant respiratory dysfunction.","Lu, H.; Ai, J.; Shen, Y.; Li, Y.; Li, T.; Zhou, X.; Zhang, H.; Zhang, Q.; Ling, Y.; Wang, S.; Qu, H.; Gao, Y.; Li, Y.; Yu, K.; Zhu, D.; Zhu, H.; Tian, R.; Zeng, M.; Li, Q.; Song, Y.; Li, X.; Xu, J.; Xu, J.; Mao, E.; Hu, B.; Li, X.; Zhu, L.; Zhang, W.",2020-02-23,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.02.19.20025031,1,Wenhong Zhang,"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025031v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025031v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
20558,Spatial-temporal relationship between population mobility and COVID-19 outbreaks in South Carolina: A time series forecasting analysis,"BackgroundPopulation mobility is closely associated with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) transmission, and it could be used as a proximal indicator to predict future outbreaks, which could inform proactive non-pharmaceutical interventions for disease control. South Carolina (SC) is one of the states which reopened early and then suffered from a sharp increase of COVID-19.

ObjectiveTo examine the spatial-temporal relationship between population mobility and COVID-19 outbreaks and use population mobility to predict daily new cases at both state- and county- levels in SC.

MethodsThis longitudinal study used disease surveillance data and Twitter-based population mobility data from March 6 to November 11, 2020 in SC and its top five counties with the largest number of cumulative confirmed cases. Daily new case was calculated by subtracting the cumulative confirmed cases of previous day from the total cases. Population mobility was assessed using the number of users with travel distance larger than 0.5 mile which was calculated based on their geotagged twitters. Poisson count time series model was employed to carry out the research goals.

ResultsPopulation mobility was positively associated with state-level daily COVID-19 incidence and those of the top five counties (i.e., Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, Richland). At the state-level, final model with time window within the last 7-day had the smallest prediction error, and the prediction accuracy was as high as 98.7%, 90.9%, and 81.6% for the next 3-, 7-, 14- days, respectively. Among Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, and Richland counties, the best predictive models were established based on their observations in the last 9-, 14-, 28-, 20-, and 9- days, respectively. The 14-day prediction accuracy ranged from 60.3% to 74.5%.

ConclusionsPopulation mobility was positively associated with COVID-19 incidences at both state- and county- levels in SC. Using Twitter-based mobility data could provide acceptable prediction for COVID-19 daily new cases. Population mobility measured via social media platform could inform proactive measures and resource relocations to curb disease outbreaks and their negative influences.","Zeng, C.; Zhang, J.; Li, Z.; Sun, X.; Olatosi, B.; Weissman, S.; Li, X.",2021-01-08,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.01.02.21249119,2,Chengbo Zeng,University of South Carolina,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.02.21249119v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.02.21249119v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.2196/27045
12653,Use of a humanized anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody (itolizumab) in elderly patients with moderate COVID-19,"IntroductionThe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a recent outbreak of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). In Cuba, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 11. Elderly with multiple comorbidities are particularly susceptible to adverse clinical outcomes in the course of SARS CoV-2 infection. During the outbreak, a local transmission event took place in a nursing home in Villa Clara province, Cuba, in which nineteen elderly residents were positive for SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsBased on the increased susceptibility to viral-induced cytokine release syndrome inducing respiratory and systemic complications in this population, the patients were included in an expanded access clinical trial to receive itolizumab, an anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody.

ResultsAll the patients had underlying medical conditions. The product was well tolerated. After the first dose, the course of the disease was favorable and 18 out of 19 (94.7%) patients were discharged clinically recovered with negative RT-PCR at 13 days (median). One dose of itolizumab, circulating IL-6 decreased in the first 24-48 hours in patients with high baseline values, whereas in patients with low levels, this concentration remained over low values. To preliminary assess the effect of itolizumab, a control group was selected among the Cuban COVID-19 patients, which did not receive immunomodulatory therapy. Control subjects were well-matched regarding age, comorbidities and severity of the disease. Every three moderately ill patients treated with itolizumab, one admission in intensive care unit (ICU) was prevented.

Discussion/ConclusionItolizumab was well tolerated. Its effect is associated with a reduction and controlling IL-6 serum levels. Moreover, treated patients had a favorable clinical outcome, considering their poor prognosis. This treatment is associated significantly with a decrease the risk to be admitted in ICU and reduced 10 times the risk of death. This study corroborates that the timely use of itolizumab, in combination with other antiviral and anticoagulant therapies, is associated with a reduction the COVID-19 disease worsening and mortality. The humanized antibody itolizumab emerges as a therapeutic alternative for patients with COVID-19 and suggests its possible use in patients with cytokine release syndrome from other pathologies.","Ramos-Suzarte, M.; Diaz, Y.; Martin, Y.; Calderon, N.

20922,GIS-Based Analysis Framework for Identifying COVID-19 Incidence and Fatality Determinants at National Level Case study: Africa,"BackgroundCOVID-19 pandemic is an extraordinary threat with significant implications in all aspects of human life, therefore, it represents the most immediate challenges for all countries all over the world.

ObjectivesThis study is intended to develop a GIS-based analysis model to explore, quantify and model the relationships between COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and their potential predictor variables.

MethodFor this purpose, a model was developed to estimate COVID-19 incidence and fatality rates in Africa up to 16th of August 2020 at the national level. The model involved Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) analysis through ArcGIS was applied.

ResultSpatial Autocorrelation Analysis revealed that there was positive spatial autocorrelation in COVID-19 incidence (Moran index 0.16. P value <0.1), and fatality (Moran index 0.0.35, P value<0.01) rates within different African countries. At continental level, OLS revealed that COVID-19 incidence rate was found to be positively associated with overcrowding, health expenditure, HIV infections and air pollution and negatively associated with BCG vaccine ({beta}=2.97,1.45, 0.01, 3.29, -47.65 respectively, P< 0.05) At the same time, COVID-19 fatality was found to be positively related to asthma prevalence and tobacco use. Yet, certain level of inconsistency was noted in the case of COVID-19 fatality, which was negatively related to elder population, poverty, and cardiovascular mortality (P<0.05). This model showed convenient level of validity in modeling the relationship between COVID-19 incidence as well as fatality and their key predictors using GWR. In this respect, the model explained about 58% and 55% of the variance in COVID-19 incidence and fatality rates, respectively, as a function of considered predictors.

ConclusionApplication of the suggested model can assist in guiding intervention strategies, particularly in case of local and community level whenever the data on COVID-19 cases and predictors variables are available.","Hassaan, M.

27280,COVID-19 Associated Mucormycosis: Scoping Review Protocol,"Background and ObjectiveMucormycosis, a serious and rare fungal infection, has occurred concurrently in COVID-19 patients globally. Mucormycosis is associated with a high risk of all-cause mortality, with mortality depending on body site infected, fungus type, and the patients overall condition. This deadly fungal infection is quite difficult and expensive to treat. Therefore, this scoping review aims to map all the empirical evidence on the COVID-19 associated mucormycosis with a special focus on clinical presentation, treatment, and patient outcomes.

MethodsThe proposed scoping review will be developed by adhering to the JBI methodology for scoping reviews and will be reported as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). A detailed search strategy has already been utilized to locate both published and unpublished studies. Literature search was carried out in three phases. PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Google scholar was searched. We will include all those studies which are presenting mucormycosis cases in COVID-19 positive patients. Data will be extracted in a pre-designed data extraction sheet and risk of bias will be assessed using JBI critical appraisal tool. The primary outcome will be to summarize the clinical presentation, treatment, and patient outcomes in COVID-19 associated mucormycosis. Data will be presented in tabular form.

10044,In-depth virological assessment of kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread widely, causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and significant mortality. However, data on viral loads and antibody kinetics in immunocompromised populations are lacking. We aimed to determine nasopharyngeal and plasma viral loads via RT-PCR and SARS-CoV-2 serology via ELISA and study their association with severe forms of COVID-19 and death in kidney transplant recipients. In this study we examined hospitalized kidney transplant recipients with non-severe (n = 21) and severe (n =19) COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal and plasma viral load and serological response were evaluated based on outcomes and disease severity. Ten recipients (25%) displayed persistent viral shedding 30 days after symptom onset. The SARS-CoV-2 viral load of the upper respiratory tract was not associated with severe COVID-19, whereas the plasma viral load was associated with COVID-19 severity (p=0.0087) and mortality (p=0.024). All patients harbored antibodies the second week after symptom onset that persisted for two months. We conclude that plasma viral load is associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, whereas nasopharyngeal viral load is not. SARS-CoV-2 shedding is prolonged in kidney transplant recipients and the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 does not show significant impairment in this series of transplant recipients.","Benotmane, I.; Gautier-Vargas, G.; Wendling, M.-J.; Perrin, P.; Velay, A.; Bassand, X.; Bedo, D.; Baldacini, C.; Sagnard, M.; Bozman, D.-F.; Della-Chiesa, M.; Solis, M.; Gallais, F.; Cognard, N.; Olagne, J.; Delagreverie, H.; Gontard, L.; Panaget, B.; Marx, D.; Heibel, F.; Braun-Parvez, L.; Moulin, B.; Caillard, S.; Fafi-Kremer, S.",2020-06-19,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.17.20132076,1,Samira Fafi-Kremer,"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.17.20132076v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.17.20132076v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1111/ajt.16251
20077,A New Extension of State-Space SIR Model to Account for Underreporting- An Application to the COVID-19 transmission in California and Florida,"In the absence of sufficient testing capacity for COVID-19, a substantial number of infecteds are expected to remain undetected. Since the undetected cases are not quarantined, they are expected to transmit the infection at a much higher rate than their quarantined counterparts. That is, under the lack of extensive random testing, the actual prevalence and incidence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection may be entirely different from that being reported. Thus, it is imperative that the information on the percentage of undetected (or unreported) cases be considered while estimating the parameters and forecasting the transmission dynamics of the epidemic.

In this paper, we have developed a new version of the basic susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) compartmental model, called the susceptible-infected (quarantined/ free) -recovered-deceased [SI(Q/F)RD] model, to incorporate the impact of undetected cases on the transmission dynamics of the epidemic. Further, we have presented a Dirichlet-Beta state-space formulation of the SI(Q/F)RD model for the estimation of its parameters using posterior realizations from Gibbs sampling procedure. As a demonstration, the proposed methodology is implemented to forecast the COVID-19 transmission in California and Florida.

12127,Severe COVID-19 is associated with elevated serum IgA and antiphospholipid IgA-antibodies,"BackgroundWhile the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is becoming increasingly clear, there is little data on IgA response, the first line of bronchial immune defense.

ObjectiveTo determine, whether COVID-19 is associated with a vigorous total IgA response and whether IgA autoantibodies are associated with complications of severe illness. Since thrombotic events are frequent in severe COVID-19 and resemble hypercoagulation of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), our approach focused on antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL).

Materials and methodsIn this retrospective cohort study we compared clinical data and aPL from 64 patients with COVID-19 from three independent centers (two in Switzerland, one in Liechtenstein). Samples were collected from April 9, 2020 to May 1, 2020. Total IgA and aPL were measured with FDA-approved commercially available clinical diagnostic kits.

ResultsClinical records of the 64 patients with COVID-19 were reviewed and divided into a cohort with mild illness (mCOVID, n=26 [41%]), a discovery cohort with severe illness (sdCOVD, n=14 [22%]) and a confirmation cohort with severe illness (scCOVID, n=24 [38%]). Severe illness was significantly associated with increased total IgA (sdCOVID, P=0.01; scCOVID, P<0.001). Total IgG levels were similar in both cohorts. Among aPL, both cohorts with severe illness significantly correlated with elevated anti-Cardiolipin IgA (sdCOVID and scCOVID, P<0.001), anti-Cardiolipin IgM (sdCOVID, P=0.003; scCOVID, P<0.001), and anti-Beta2 Glycoprotein-1 IgA (sdCOVID and scCOVID, P<0.001). Systemic lupus erythematosus was excluded from all patients as a potential confounder of APS.

ConclusionsHigher total IgA and IgA-aPL were consistently associated with severe illness. These novel data strongly suggest that a vigorous antiviral IgA-response triggered in the bronchial mucosa induces systemic autoimmunity.","Hasan Ali, O.; Bomze, D.; Risch, L.; Brugger, S.

16468,Using Test Positivity and Reported Case Rates to Estimate State-Level COVID-19 Prevalence and Seroprevalence in the United States,"Accurate estimates of infection prevalence and seroprevalence are essential for evaluating and informing public health responses needed to address the ongoing spread of COVID-19 in the United States. A data-driven Bayesian single parameter semi-empirical model was developed and used to evaluate state-level prevalence and seroprevalence of COVID-19 using daily reported cases and test positivity ratios. COVID-19 prevalence is well-approximated by the geometric mean of the positivity rate and the reported case rate. As of December 8, 2020, we estimate nation-wide a prevalence of 1.4% [Credible Interval (CrI): 0.8%-1.9%] and a seroprevalence of 11.1% [CrI: 10.1%-12.2%], with state-level prevalence ranging from 0.3% [CrI: 0.2%-0.4%] in Maine to 3.0% [CrI: 1.1%-5.7%] in Pennsylvania, and seroprevalence from 1.4% [CrI: 1.0%-2.0%] in Maine to 22% [CrI: 18%-27%] in New York. The use of this simple and easy-to-communicate model will improve the ability to make public health decisions that effectively respond to the ongoing pandemic.

20505,Lockdown Effects on Sars-CoV-2 Transmission - The evidence from Northern Jutland,"The exact impact of lockdowns and other NPIs on Sars-CoV-2 transmission remain a matter of debate as early models assumed 100% susceptible homogenously transmitting populations, an assumption known to overestimate counterfactual transmission, and since most real epidemiological data are subject to massive confounding variables. Here, we analyse the unique case-controlled epidemiological dataset arising from the selective lockdown of parts of Northern Denmark, but not others, as a consequence of the spread of mink-related mutations in November 2020. Our analysis shows that while infection levels decreased, they did so before lockdown was effective, and infection numbers also decreased in neighbour municipalities without mandates. Direct spill-over to neighbour municipalities or the simultaneous mass testing do not explain this. Instead, control of infection pockets possibly together with voluntary social behaviour was apparently effective before the mandate, explaining why the infection decline occurred before and in both the mandated and non-mandated areas. The data suggest that efficient infection surveillance and voluntary compliance make full lockdowns unnecessary at least in some circumstances.","Kepp, K.

3282,Suppression and Mitigation Strategies for Control of COVID-19 in New Zealand,"A standard SEIR-type compartment model, parameterised for New Zealand, was used to simulate the spread of Covid19 in New Zealand and to test the effectiveness of various control strategies. Control aims can be broadly categorised as either suppression or mitigation. Suppression aims to keep cases to an absolute minimum for as long as possible. Mitigation aims to allow a controlled outbreak to occur, with the aim of preventing significant overloads on healthcare systems and gradually allowing the population to develop herd immunity.

Both types of strategy are fraught with uncertainty. Suppression strategies can succeed in delaying an outbreak, but only for as long as such control measures can be sustained. Once controls are eased or restricted, an epidemic is likely to follow as no herd immunity has been acquired. The success or failure of mitigation strategies can depend sensitively on the timing and efficacy of control measures, and require the ability to bring rapidly growing outbreaks under immediate control when needed. This is as yet untested even for a combination of national interventions including case isolation, household quarantine, population-wide social distancing and closure of schools and universities.

Although there are disadvantages to both types of approach, suppression has the advantage of buying time until a vaccine and/or treatment become available and allowing NZ to learn from rapidly unfolding events in other countries. A combination of successful suppression, strong border measures, and widespread contact tracing and testing resulting in containment could allow periods when control measures can be relaxed, but only if cases are reduced to a handful.

Executive SummaryO_LISuppression strategies aim to keep the number of cases to an absolute minimum for as long as possible. This requires early and effective control interventions.
C_LIO_LISuppression can only delay an epidemic, not prevent it, but may buy enough time for a vaccine or treatment to become available.
C_LIO_LIMitigation strategies aim to control an epidemic so that herd immunity is acquired by the population without overwhelming healthcare systems.
C_LIO_LIMitigation strategies are likely to be very high risk: they are unproven internationally, potentially sensitive to uncertainty, and it may take years for herd immunity to be acquired.
C_LIO_LIStrategy can be switched from suppression to mitigation. For example, once successful mitigation strategies have been tested in other countries. It is likely to be difficult or impossible to switch from a mitigation to a suppression strategy.
C_LIO_LIA combination of successful suppression, strong border measures, and widespread contact tracing and testing resulting in containment could allow periods when control measures can be relaxed, but only if we can reduce cases to a handful.

Using methods to track community spread of other viruses such as poliovirus, environmental virologists and those in the wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) field quickly adapted their existing methods to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. Unlike COVID-19 case and mortality data, there was not a global dashboard to track wastewater monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 RNA worldwide.

Methods to assemble the dashboard combined standard literature review, direct submissions, and daily, social media keyword searches. Over 200 universities, 1,000 sites, and 50 countries with 59 dashboards monitor wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. However, monitoring is inequitably distributed in high-income countries and data are not widely shared publicly or accessible to researchers to inform public health actions, meta-analysis, better coordinate, and determine equitable distribution of monitoring sites.

12697,"Isolation Considered Epidemiological Model for the Prediction of COVID-19 Trend in Tokyo, Japan","BackgroundCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) currently poses a global public health threat. Although no exception, Tokyo, Japan was affected at first by only a small epidemic. Medical collapse nevertheless nearly happened because no predictive method existed for counting patients. A standard SIR epidemiological model and its derivatives predict susceptible, infectious, and removed (recovered/deaths) cases but ignore isolation of confirmed cases. Predicting COVID19 trends with hospitalized and infectious people in field separately is important to prepare beds and develop quarantine strategies.

MethodsTime-series COVID19 data from February 28 to May 23, 2020 in Tokyo were adopted for this study. A novel epidemiological model based on delay differential equation was proposed. The model can evaluate patients in hospitals and infectious cases in the field. Various data such as daily new cases, cumulative infections, patients in hospital, and PCR test positivity ratios were used to examine the model. This approach derived an alternative formulation equivalent to the standard SIR model. Its results were compared quantitatively with those of the present isolation model.

ResultsThe basic reproductive number, inferred as 2.30, is a dimensionless parameter composed of modeling parameters. Effects of intervention to mitigate the epidemic spread were assessed a posteriori. An exit policy of how and when to release a statement of emergency was also assessed using the model. Furthermore, results suggest that the rapid isolation of infectious cases has a large potential to effectively mitigate the spread of infection and restores social and economic activities safely.

ConclusionsA novel mathematical model was proposed and examined using COVID19 data for Tokyo. Results show that shortening the period from infection to hospitalization is effective against outbreak without rigorous public health intervention and control. Faster and precise case cluster detection and wider and quicker introduction of testing measures are strongly recommended.","Utamura, M.; Koizumi, M.; Kirikami, S.",2020-08-16,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.31.20165829,2,Motoaki Utamura,Utamura professional engineer office,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.31.20165829v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.31.20165829v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.2196/23624

24794,Genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 transmission lineages in Ecuador,"Characterisation of SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity through space and time can reveal trends in virus importation and domestic circulation, and permit the exploration of questions regarding the early transmission dynamics. Here we present a detailed description of SARS-CoV-2 genomic epidemiology in Ecuador, one of the hardest hit countries during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. We generate and analyse 160 whole genome sequences sampled from all provinces of Ecuador in 2020. Molecular clock and phylgeographic analysis of these sequences in the context of global SARS-CoV-2 diversity enable us to identify and characterise individual transmission lineages within Ecuador, explore their spatiotemporal distributions, and consider their introduction and domestic circulation. Our results reveal a pattern of multiple international importations across the country, with apparent differences between key provinces. Transmission lineages were mostly introduced before the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), with differential degrees of persistence and national dissemination.","Gutierrez, B.; Marquez, S.; Prado-Vivar, B.; Becerra-Wong, M.; Guadalupe, J.

22700,Applicability of Neighborhood and Building Scale Wastewater-Based Genomic Epidemiology to Track the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic and other Pathogens.,"The benefits of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for tracking the viral load of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, have become apparent since the start of the pandemic. However, most sampling occurs at the wastewater treatment plant influent and therefore can only monitor SARS-CoV-2 concentration and spread within the entire catchment, which can encompass multiple municipalities. Furthermore, most WBE only quantifies the virus, and therefore miss crucial information that can be gained by sequencing SARS-CoV-2. Here we demonstrate feasibility of sampling at the neighborhood or building complex level using a mix of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and targeted sequencing to provide a more refined understanding of the local dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 strains. When coupled with the higher-level treatment plant samples, this creates an opportunity for health officials to monitor the spread of the virus at different spatial and temporal scales to inform policy decisions.

Here we demonstrate the feasibility of tracking SARS-CoV-2 at the neighborhood, hospital, and nursing home level with the ability to detect one COVID-19 positive out of 60 nursing home residents. The viral load obtained was correlative with the number of COVID-19 patients being treated in the hospital. Sequencing of the samples over time demonstrated that nonsynonymous mutations fluctuate in the viral population, and wastewater-based sequencing could be an efficient approach to monitor for vaccine or convalescent plasma escape mutants, as well as mutations that could reduce the efficacy of diagnostics. Furthermore, while SARS-CoV-2 was detected by untargeted RNA sequencing, qPCR and targeted whole genome amplicon sequencing were more reliable methods for tracking the pandemic. From our sequencing data, clades and shifts in mutation profiles within the community were traceable and could be used to determine if vaccine or diagnostics need to be adapted to ensure continued efficacy.

16031,Direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR-Cas13a and a mobile phone,"The December 2019 outbreak of a novel respiratory virus, SARS-CoV-2, has become an ongoing global pandemic due in part to the challenge of identifying symptomatic, asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers of the virus. CRISPR-based diagnostics that utilize RNA and DNA-targeting enzymes can augment gold-standard PCR-based testing if they can be made rapid, portable and accurate. Here we report the development of an amplification-free CRISPR-Cas13a-based mobile phone assay for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasal swab RNA extracts. The assay achieved [~]100 copies/L sensitivity in under 30 minutes and accurately detected a set of positive clinical samples in under 5 minutes. We combined crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA to improve sensitivity and specificity, and we directly quantified viral load using enzyme kinetics.

6540,Covid-19 Pandemic in relation to levels of Pollution with PM2.5 and Ambient Salinity. An Environmental Wake-up Call,"INTRODUCTIONCovid-19 infection continues to be a source of great loss of life and global suffering, necessitating national lockdowns. There are however some countries and cities which appear to have contained the pandemic. Common to these countries are environmental factors including the levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) and ambient salinity.

METHODPM2.5 and ambient salinity were assessed in a number of cities, differentially affected by Covid-19 infection. The cities chosen to be assessed were divided into two groups. The first group included cities having significantly high rates of Covid-19 infection, while the second group consisted of coastal cities or small island countries, all of which have low rates of Covid-19 infection. Minimum and maximum levels of PM2.5 were obtained from the Air Quality Index, one month before and one month after statutory lockdown. Salinity levels were obtained from a study that assessed chloride ion wet deposition, a surrogate for ambient salinity.

RESULTSOne month prior to the statutory national lock-down or mandatory restrictions, there appear to be high levels of particulate matter, PM2.5 (min-max 67.4 - 118.7 AQI), in countries which had a high incidence of Covid-19 infection compared to lower levels in countries that have contained the infection (min-max 45.6 - 79.8) (p<0.046). One month after national restrictions there still appeared to be higher levels of particulate matter, PM2.5 (min-max 51 - 90.5 AQI), in countries which had a high incidence of Covid-19 infection compared to countries that have contained the infection (min-max 42.7 - 69.5 AQI) but this was not statistically significant.

There seemed to be an inverse relationship between Covid-19 infection and ambient salinity levels. Countries that were spared high Covid-19 infection rates, besides their geographical isolation, also have higher ambient salinity levels (124 - 617mgCl/m2/TAG) compared to salinity levels noted in countries with high Covid-19 rates of infection (28.4 - 162. mgCl/m2/TAG) (p<0.003).

CONCLUSIONHigh levels of PM2.5 in the presence of low ambient salinity may increase the risk of Covid-19 infection in the population. Addressing these two environmental factors may attenuate the severity of the pandemic.","Muscat Baron, Y.",2020-05-08,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.03.20087056,1,Yves Muscat Baron,"Mater Dei Hospital, Medical School of Malta",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20087056v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20087056v1.full.pdf,cc_by,"NA"
8115,Investigation on the interaction between nifedipine and ritonavir containing antivirus regimens: a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis,"Background and ObjectiveHypertension is a common comorbidity of patients with COVID-19, SARS or HIV infection. Those patients are often treated with commonly used antiviral and antihypertensive agents concomitantly, such as ritonavir-containing regimens and nifedipine. Since ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, when nifedipine is combined with ritonavir-containing antiviral drugs, there is a potential risk of drug-drug interaction. This study aimed to provide guidance on nifedipine treatment during and after co-administration with ritonavir-containing regimens using a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) analysis.

MethodsA PBPK/PD model was developed for nifedipine by the software of Simcyp(R), and the model was verified using published data. The effects of ritonavir on nifedipine exposures and systolic blood pressure were assessed for instant-release, sustained-release and controlled-release formulations. Moreover, various nifedipine regimens were investigated when co-administrated with and withdrawing ritonavir.

ResultsPBPK/PD models for three formulations of nifedipine were successfully established. The model predicted pharmacokinetic profiles of nifedipine were comparable to the published data. Ratios of predicted versus observed AUCDDI/AUCNifedipine of nifedipine were within 0.70- to 1.83-fold. Model simulations showed that the inhibitory effect of ritonavir on CYP3A4 increased the Cmax of nifedipine by 9.82-34.35 times and the AUC24h by 44.94-50.77 times at steady state. Moreover, nifedipine dose reduced to 1/16 of the regular dose during ritonavir co-administration could lead to severe hypotension.

ConclusionsRitonavir had a pronounced influence on the pharmacokinetics and antihypertensive effect of nifedipine. It is not recommended for patients to take nifedipine and ritonavir-containing regimens simultaneously.","Niu, W.-J.; Li, S.-Z.; Jin, S.-S.; Lin, X.-Y.; Zhang, M.-W.; Cai, W.-M.; Zhong, M.-K.; Xiang, X.-Q.; Jiao, Z.",2020-05-26,Pharmacology And Therapeutics,10.1101/2020.05.19.20106658,1,Zheng Jiao,"Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20106658v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20106658v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
26503,The evaluation of a novel digital immunochromatographic assay with silver amplification to detect SARS-CoV-2,"IntroductionRapid antigen tests are convenient for diagnosing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); however, they have lower sensitivities than nucleic acid amplification tests. In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of Quick Chaser(R) Auto SARS-CoV-2, a novel digital immunochromatographic assay that is expected to have higher sensitivity than conventional antigen tests.

MethodsA prospective observational study was conducted between February 8 and March 24, 2021. We simultaneously obtained two nasopharyngeal samples, one for evaluation with the QuickChaser(R) Auto SARS-CoV-2 antigen test and the other for assessment with reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), considered the gold-standard reference test. The limit of detection (LOD) of the new antigen test was compared with those of four other commercially available rapid antigen tests.

ResultsA total of 1401 samples were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by reference RT-PCR in 83 (5.9%) samples, of which 36 (43.4%) were collected from symptomatic patients. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 74.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 64.0-83.6%), 99.8% (95% CI: 99.5-100%), 96.9% (95% CI: 89.2-99.6%), and 98.4% (95% CI: 97.6-99.0%), respectively. When limited to samples with a cycle threshold (Ct) <30 or those from symptomatic patients, the sensitivity increased to 98.3% and 88.9%, respectively. The QuickChaser(R) Auto SARS-CoV-2 detected 34-120 copies/test, which indicated greater sensitivity than the other rapid antigen tests.

ConclusionsQuickChaser(R) Auto SARS-CoV-2 showed sufficient sensitivity and specificity in clinical samples of symptomatic patients. The sensitivity was comparable to RT-PCR in samples with Ct<30.","Kurihara, Y.; Kiyasu, Y.; Akashi, Y.; Takeuchi, Y.; Narahara, K.; Mori, S.; Takeshige, T.; Notake, S.; Ueda, A.; Nakamura, K.; Ishikawa, H.; Suzuki, H.",2021-05-13,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.05.06.21256738,1,Yoshihiko Kiyasu,Tsukuba Medical Center Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.06.21256738v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.06.21256738v1.full.pdf,cc_by,"NA"
20961,"Increased infections, but not viral burden, with a new SARS-CoV-2 variant","BackgroundA new variant of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01, was identified in the UK in December-2020. Direct estimates of its potential to enhance transmission are limited.

MethodsNose and throat swabs from 28-September-2020 to 2-January-2021 in the UKs nationally representative surveillance study were tested by RT-PCR for three genes (N, S and ORF1ab). Those positive only on ORF1ab+N, S-gene target failures (SGTF), are compatible with B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01. We investigated cycle threshold (Ct) values (a proxy for viral load), percentage of positives, population positivity and growth rates in SGTF vs non-SGTF positives.

Results15,166(0.98%) of 1,553,687 swabs were PCR-positive, 8,545(56%) with three genes detected and 3,531(23%) SGTF. SGTF comprised an increasing, and triple-gene positives a decreasing, percentage of infections from late-November in most UK regions/countries, e.g. from 15% to 38% to 81% over 1.5 months in London. SGTF Ct values correspondingly declined substantially to similar levels to triple-gene positives. Population-level SGTF positivity remained low (<0.25%) in all regions/countries until late-November, when marked increases with and without self-reported symptoms occurred in southern England (to 1.5-3%), despite stable rates of non-SGTF cases. SGTF positivity rates increased on average 6% more rapidly than rates of non-SGTF positives (95% CI 4-9%) supporting addition rather than replacement with B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01. Excess growth rates for SGTF vs non-SGTF positives were similar in those up to high school age (5% (1-8%)) and older individuals (6% (4-9%)).

ConclusionsDirect population-representative estimates show that the B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 SARS-CoV-2 variant leads to higher infection rates, but does not seem particularly adapted to any age group.","Walker, A.

26963,ACTIVATE-2: A DOUBLE-BLIND RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF BCG VACCINATION AGAINST COVID19 IN INDIVIDUALS AT RISK,"BCG vaccination induces heterologous protection against respiratory tract infections, and in children improves survival independently of tuberculosis prevention. The phase III ACTIVATE-2 study assessed whether BCG could also protect against COVID19 in the elderly. In this double-blind, randomized trial, elderly Greek patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either BCG revaccination or placebo at hospital discharge, followed by 6 months observation for incidence of COVID19 infection. BCG revaccination resulted in 68% risk reduction for total COVID19 clinical and microbiological diagnoses (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.13-0.79). Five patients in the placebo group and one in the BCG-vaccinated group had severe COVID19 that necessitated hospitalization. 3 months after BCG vaccination 1.3% of placebo and 4.7% of BCG-vaccinated volunteers had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These data argue that BCG revaccination is safe and protects the elderly against COVID19. BCG revaccination may represent a viable preventive measure against COVID19.","Tsilika, M.; Taks, E.; Dolianitis, K.; Kotsaki, A.; Leventogiannis, K.; Damoulari, C.; Kostoula, M.; Paneta, M.; Adamis, G.; Papanikolaou, I.

15229,Pre-existing T cell memory as a risk factor for severe 1 COVID-19 in the elderly,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) displays high clinical variability but the parameters that determine disease severity are still unclear. Pre-existing T cell memory has been hypothesized as a protective mechanism but conclusive evidence is lacking. Here we demonstrate that all unexposed individuals harbor SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells with marginal cross-reactivity to common cold corona and other unrelated viruses. They display low functional avidity and broad protein target specificities and their frequencies correlate with the overall size of the CD4+ memory compartment reflecting the """"immunological age"""" of an individual. COVID-19 patients have strongly increased SARS-CoV-2-specific inflammatory T cell responses that are correlated with severity. Strikingly however, patients with severe COVID-19 displayed lower TCR functional avidity and less clonal expansion. Our data suggest that a low avidity pre-existing T cell memory negatively impacts on the T cell response quality against neoantigens such as SARS-CoV-2, which may predispose to develop inappropriate immune reactions especially in the elderly. We propose the immunological age as an independent risk factor to develop severe COVID-19.

Key points- Pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-reactive memory T cells are present in all humans, but have low functional avidity and broad target specificities
- Pre-existing memory T cells show only marginal cross-reactivity to common cold corona viruses
- Frequencies of pre-existing memory T cells increase with the size of the CD4+ memory compartment reflecting the """"immunological age"""" of the individual
- Low-avidity and polyclonal, but strongly enhanced SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses develop in severe COVID-19, suggesting their origin from pre-existing memory

14190,Automated COVID-19 Detection from Chest X-Ray Images : A High Resolution Network (HRNet)Approach,"The pandemic, originated by novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), continuing its devastating effect on the health, well-being, and economy of the global population. A critical step to restrain this pandemic is the early detection of COVID-19 in the human body, to constraint the exposure and control the spread of the virus. Chest X-Rays are one of the non-invasive tools to detect this disease as the manual PCR diagnosis process is quite tedious and time-consuming. In this work, we propose an automated COVID-19 classifier, utilizing available COVID and non-COVID X-Ray datasets, along with High Resolution Network (HRNet) for feature extraction embedding with the UNet for segmentation purposes. To evaluate the proposed dataset, several baseline experiments have been performed employing numerous deep learning architectures. With extensive experiment, we got 99.26% accuracy, 98.53% sensitivity, and 98.82% specificity with HRNet which surpasses the performances of the existing models. Our proposed methodology ensures unbiased high accuracy, which increases the probability of incorporating X-Ray images into the diagnosis of the disease.","Ahmed, S.; Hossain, T.; Hoque, O.

26162,Within-host evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in an immunosuppressed COVID-19 patient: a source of immune escape variants,"The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants showing increased transmissibility and immune escape is a matter of global concern. Their origin remains unclear, but intra-host virus evolution during persistent infections could be a contributing factor. Here, we studied the long-term SARS-CoV-2 infection in an immunosuppressed organ transplant recipient. Frequent respiratory specimens were tested for variant viral genomes by RT-qPCR, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and virus isolation. Late in infection, several virus variants emerged which escaped neutralization by COVID-19 convalescent and vaccine-induced antisera and had acquired genome mutations similar to those found in variants of concern first identified in UK, South Africa, and Brazil. Importantly, infection of susceptible hACE2-transgenic mice with one of the patients escape variants elicited protective immunity against re-infection with either the parental virus, the escape variant or the South African variant of concern, demonstrating broad immune control. Upon lowering immunosuppressive treatment, the patient generated spike-specific neutralizing antibodies and resolved the infection. Our results indicate that immunocompromised patients are an alarming source of potentially harmful SARS-CoV-2 variants and open up new avenues for the updating of COVID-19 vaccines.","Weigang, S.; Fuchs, J.; Zimmer, G.; Schnepf, D.; Kern, L.; Beer, J.; Luxenburger, H.; Ankerhold, J.; Falcone, V.; Kemming, J.; Hofmann, M.; Thimme, R.; Neumann-Haefelin, C.; Ulferts, S.; Grosse, R.; Hornuss, D.; Tanriver, Y.; Rieg, S.; Wagner, D.; Huzly, D.; Schwemmle, M.; Panning, M.; Kochs, G.",2021-05-05,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.04.30.21256244,1,Georg Kochs,"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Freiburg",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.30.21256244v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.30.21256244v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

Secondly, we compared patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and patients hospitalized with influenza.

MethodsWe conducted a cohort study using eight routinely-collected healthcare databases from Spain and the US, standardized to the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership common data model. Three cohorts of patients with a history of cancer were included: i) diagnosed with COVID-19, ii) hospitalized with COVID-19, and iii) hospitalized with influenza in 2017-2018. Patients were followed from index date to 30 days or death. We reported demographics, cancer subtypes, comorbidities, and 30-day outcomes.

ResultsWe included 118,155 patients with a cancer history in the COVID-19 diagnosed and 41,939 in the COVID-19 hospitalized cohorts. The most frequent cancer subtypes were prostate and breast cancer (range: 5-19% and 1-14% in the diagnosed cohort, respectively). Hematological malignancies were also frequent, with non-Hodgkins lymphoma being among the 5 most common cancer subtypes in the diagnosed cohort. Overall, patients were more frequently aged above 65 years and had multiple comorbidities. Occurrence of death ranged from 8% to 14% and from 18% to 26% in the diagnosed and hospitalized COVID-19 cohorts, respectively. Patients hospitalized with influenza (n=242,960) had a similar distribution of cancer subtypes, sex, age and comorbidities but lower occurrence of adverse events.

ConclusionPatients with a history of cancer and COVID-19 have advanced age, multiple comorbidities, and a high occurence of COVID-19-related events. Additionaly, hematological malignancies were frequent in these patients.This observational study provides epidemiologic characteristics that can inform clinical care and future etiological studies.","Roel, E.; Pistillo, A.; Recalde, M.; Sena, A.

12778,The Impact of COVID-19 on Medical Practice: A Nationwide Survey of Dermatologists and Healthcare Providers in Iraq,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed medical practice worldwide. It posed a significant impact on different health services, including dermatology.

Methods and objectivesTwo online surveys were conducted to determine the prevalence of personal protective equipment-related skin complications (200 healthcare providers were included) and to demonstrate the outbreaks impact on dermatology practice (100 dermatologists were included).

ResultsIn the first survey, the response rate was 72.46%. PPE- related dermatoses were reported by 147 (73%) participants, including frictional dermatitis (51.9%), mechanical acne (33.1%), contact dermatitis (29.9%), nonspecific rash (17.5%), urticaria (9.1%) and skin infections (3.2%).

The response rate of the second survey was 64%. COVID-19 emerging cutaneous manifestations were recognized by 20% of dermatologists, including maculopapular rash (41.67%), urticaria (37.50%), chilblain (25%) and vasculitis (16.67). Telemedicine was provided by 73% of the dermatologists. The relapse rates of psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, rosacea, vitiligo and alopecia areata were noticeably increased as observed by 62%, 50%, 20%, and 4% of dermatologists, respectively. Most dermatologists (89%) reported minimal use of immunosuppressive drugs amid the pandemic.

MethodsOnly confirmed COVID-19 cases who are Vietnamese and locally infected with available data on date of symptom onset and clearly defined window of possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure were included. We used three parametric forms with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method for Bayesian Inference to estimate incubation period for Vietnamese COVID-19 cases. Leave-one-out Information Criterion was used to assess the performance of three models.

ResultsA total of 19 cases identified from 23 Jan 2020 to 13 April 2020 was included in our analysis. Average incubation periods estimated using different distribution model ranged from 6.0 days to 6.4 days with the Weibull distribution demonstrated the best fit to the data. The estimated mean of incubation period using Weibull distribution model was 6.4 days (95% credible interval (CrI): 4.89-8.5), standard deviation (SD) was 3.05 (95%CI 3.05-5.30), median was 5.6, ranges from 1.35 to 13.04 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentiles). Extreme estimation of incubation periods is within 14 days from possible infection.

ConclusionThis analysis provides evidence for an average incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 6.4 days. Our findings support existing guidelines for 14 days of quarantine of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Although for extreme cases, the quarantine period should be extended up to three weeks.","Bui, L. V.; Nguyen, H. T.; Levine, H.; Nguyen, H.; Nguyen, T. A.; Nguyen, T. P.; Nguyen, T.; Do, T. T.

Saliva was evaluated as a diagnostic specimen for SARS-CoV-2 using the cobas(R) SARS-CoV-2 Test on the cobas(R) 6800 instrument. Saliva specimens submitted from various patient populations under investigation for COVID-19 from March-July 2020 were processed in the laboratory with sterile phosphate-buffered saline in a 1:2 dilution and vortexed with glass beads. The processed saliva samples were tested using a commercial assay for detection of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene (LightMix(R)) in comparison to the cobas(R) SARS-CoV-2 Test. 22/64 (34.4%) of the saliva samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Positive and negative concordance between the LightMix(R) and cobas(R) assays were 100%. There was no cross-contamination of samples observed on the cobas(R) 6800. The overall invalid rate for saliva on the cobas(R) 6800 (1/128, 0.78%) was similar to the baseline invalid rate observed for nasopharyngeal swabs/VTM and plasma samples. Saliva is a feasible specimen type for SARS-CoV-2 testing on the cobas(R) 6800, with potential to improve turnaround time and enhance testing capacity.","Matic, N.; Lawson, T.; Ritchie, G.; Stefanovic, A.; Leung, V.; Champagne, S.; Romney, M.

DesignSingle-centre, analytical, dynamic cohort study.

Participants2,701 adults ([&ge;]18 years) with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or clinico-radiological diagnosis of covid-19, who required hospital admission to covid-19 specific wards, between January 2020 and March 2021. There were 884 covid-19 admissions during the first wave (before 30 Jun 2020) and 1,817 during the second wave.

Outcome measuresin-hospital covid-19 associated mortality, ascertained from clinical records and Medical Certificate Cause of Death.

ResultsThe crude mortality rate was 25% lower during the second wave (2.23 and 1.66 deaths per 100 person-days in first and second wave respectively). However, after accounting for age, sex, dexamethasone, oxygen requirements, symptoms at admission and Charlson Comorbidity Index, mortality hazard ratio associated with covid-19 hospital admissions was 1.62 (95% confidence interval 1.26, 2.08) times higher in the second wave compared to the first.

ConclusionsAnalysis of covid-19 admissions recorded in St. Georges Hospital, shows a larger second epidemic wave, with a lower crude mortality in hospital admissions. Nevertheless, after accounting for other factors underlying risk of death for covid-19 admissions was higher in the second wave.

We analysed data from a large provider of long-term care for older people to investigate infection and mortality during the first wave of the pandemic.

MethodsCohort study of 179 UK care homes with 9,339 residents and 11,604 staff.We used manager-reported daily tallies to estimate the incidence of suspected and confirmed infection and mortality in staff and residents. Individual-level electronic health records from 8,713 residents were used to model risk factors for confirmed infection, mortality, and estimate attributable mortality.

Results2,075/9,339 residents developed COVID-19 symptoms (22.2% [95% confidence interval: 21.4%; 23.1%]), while 951 residents (10.2% [9.6%; 10.8%]) and 585 staff (5.0% [4.7%; 5.5%]) had laboratory-confirmed infections. The incidence of confirmed infection was 152.6 [143.1; 162.6] and 62.3 [57.3; 67.5] per 100,000 person-days in residents and staff respectively. 121/179 (67.6%) care homes had at least one COVID-19 infection or COVID-19-related death. Lower staffing ratios and higher occupancy rates were independent risk factors for infection.

217/607 residents with confirmed infection died (case-fatality rate: 35.7% [31.9%; 39.7%]). Mortality in residents with no direct evidence of infection was two-fold higher in care homes with outbreaks versus those without (adjusted HR 2.2 [1.8; 2.6]).

ConclusionsFindings suggest many deaths occurred in people who were infected with COVID-19, but not tested. Higher occupancy and lower staffing levels were independently associated with risks of infection. Protecting staff and residents from infection requires regular testing for COVID-19 and fundamental changes to staffing and care home occupancy.","Dutey-Magni, P.

26459,Meta-analysis of rapid direct-to-PCR assays for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2,"Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the ensuing COVID-19 pandemic present significant challenges to current diagnostic and therapeutic patient care pathways including whether new in vitro diagnostic tests can accurately identify and rule out current SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The gold standard diagnostic test to identify a current SARS-CoV-2 infection is a central laboratory-based molecular assay using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with very high accuracy of detection but which typically requires 1-2 days turn-around for results. Therefore, rapid RTPCR assays and systems have been developed which can be deployed locally (near-patient or point of care (POC), provide faster results and not impact on already stressed central laboratory capacity. Rapid test results can be returned within the same clinical encounter, facilitating timely decisions that optimise the patient care pathway and support more rapid COVID-19 diagnosis, isolation and contract tracing activities1.

Direct-to-PCR is an evolution of RT-PCR in which the patient sample is added directly to an amplification reaction without being subjected to prior nucleic acid extraction, purification, or quantification to reduce the time and monetary resources required to process samples.1 Rapid, direct-to-PCR systems further increase the speed of testing by combining rapid PCR instruments with direct-to-PCR assays, to generate results in less than two hours. This appears to be the first meta-analysis assessing the accuracy of rapid direct-to-PCR in the detection of SARS-CoV-2. In total, 10,957 unique records were identified and screened using a search string evaluation, 420 full-text reports and/or supplemental materials were assessed for inclusion. This resulted in 14 studies reporting 20 datasets with 4593 patient samples (1391 positive) included in the analysis.

The overall agreement between the rapid direct RT-PCR and gold standard centralised laboratory RT-PCR was 97.1% with 93.60% positive percent agreement and 98.63% negative percent agreement. The Cohens kappa statistical coefficient k = 0.93, indicating an almost perfect agreement and Youden Index = 0.92. These results indicate that direct-to-PCR assays can perform equivalently to the standard centralised laboratory PCR systems for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.

ObjectivesTo assess the efficacy of rapid direct-to-PCR assays and systems for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital, care home and medical research population in England from November 2020 to April 2021.

Search methodsElectronic searches of the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which includes daily updates from PubMed and Embase and preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv) were undertaken on the 30th of April 2020. Please see the PRISMA flow diagram below (figure 2).

C_FIG Selection criteriaStudies of subjects with either suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, known SARS-CoV-2 infection or known absence of infection, or those who were being screened for infection were included. Commercially available and research use rapid direct-to-PCR assays (without RNA extraction and purification reporting results within two hours) were included in the study.

Data collection, extraction and analysisStudies were screened independently, in duplicate with any disagreements resolved by discussion with a third author. Study characteristics were extracted by one author and checked by a second; extraction of study results and assessments of risk of bias and applicability were undertaken independently in duplicate.

Where studies were not publicly available, sites that undertook in-service evaluations of rapid direct-to-PCR system were contacted and asked to supply anonymised datasets. Both reviewers independently performed data extraction and verification and calculated 2x2 contingency tables of the number of true positives, false positives, false negatives and true negatives. They resolved any disagreements by discussion and by review with the third reviewer.

Main resultsTwenty study cohorts were included (described in 14 study reports, including 4 unpublished reports), reporting results for 4593 samples (1391 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2). Studies were mainly from Europe and North America, and evaluated nine direct-to-PCR assays.

ConclusionsThis appears to be the first meta-analysis assessing the accuracy of rapid direct-to-PCR in the detection of SARS-CoV-2. In total, 10,957 unique records were identified and screened using a search string evaluation, 420 full-text reports and/or supplemental materials were assessed for inclusion. This resulted in 14 studies reporting 20 datasets with 4593 patient samples (1391 positive) included in the analysis.

The overall agreement between the rapid direct RT-PCR and gold standard centralised laboratory RT-PCR was 97.10% with 93.60% positive percent agreement and 98.63% negative percent agreement. The Cohens kappa statistical coefficient k = 0.93, indicating an almost perfect agreement and Youden Index = 0.92.

22895,Inequalities in the decline and recovery of pathological cancer diagnoses during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic: a population-based study,"BackgroundThe restructuring of healthcare systems to cope with the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a reduction in clinical services such as cancer screening and diagnostics.

MethodsData from the four Northern Ireland pathology labs was used to assess trends in pathological cancer diagnoses from 1st March to 12th September 2020 overall and by cancer site, gender and age. These trends were compared to the same timeframe from 2017-2019.

ResultsBetween 1st March and 12th September 2020 there was a 23% reduction in cancer diagnoses compared to the same time period in the preceding three years. Although some recovery occurred in August and September 2020, this revealed inequalities across certain patient groups. Pathological diagnoses of lung, prostate and gynaecological malignancies remained well below pre-pandemic levels. Males and younger/middle-aged adults, particularly the 50-59 year old patient group, also lagged behind other population demographic groups in terms of returning to expected numbers of pathological cancer diagnoses.

ConclusionsThere is a critical need to protect cancer diagnostic services in the ongoing pandemic to facilitate timely investigation of potential cancer cases. Targeted public health campaigns may be needed to reduce emerging inequalities in cancer diagnoses as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.","Hamilton, A. C.; Donnelly, D. W.; Loughrey, M.

16203,WORLDWIDE CASE FATALITY RATIO OF COVID-19 OVER TIME,"BackgroundThe case fatality ratio (CFR) of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported to be variable among different countries and regions but few analyses have tracked this ratio worldwide over time.

MethodsThe primary objective was to assess the time-course evolution of CFR of COVID-19 in all countries with available data and secondary objective was to evaluate associations between country-wise CFR and country-level health, human development, demographic and economic parameters. Day-wise data of COVID-19 cases and deaths for each country was extracted from a public repository and countries with at least 1000 cases on cutoff date were clustered by unsupervised k-means on the basis of deaths per 100000 population (DP100K). Day-wise CFR (cumulative deaths divided by cumulative cases, multiplied by 100) for each country and cluster (country group) was plotted as time-series and country-level parameters were tested for association with CFR using weighted multiple linear regression.

ResultsOn September 24, 2020 there were 32140504 cumulative COVID-19 cases and 981792 deaths reported from 184 countries for a worldwide CFR of 3.06 % (95%CI 3.05 -3.07). Unsupervised k-means clustering in 157 countries with at least 1000 reported cases resulted in Clusters (country groups) A, B, C, D and E with centroid DP100K and CFR of 0.100 and 2.51 (95% CI 2.42-2.61), 0.503 and 2.28 (95% CI 2.23-2.33), 1.816 and 1.73 (95% CI 1.71-1.75), 7.395 and 1.76 (95% CI 1.75-1.76), and 36.303 and 3.82 (95% CI 3.82-3.83), respectively. In a log-log analysis DP100K and CFR were significantly positively correlated (R=0.3570, p<0.001) with each other. All country groups and majority of included countries showed a pattern of gradually increasing CFR from the beginning of pandemic, followed by a plateau and then a steady decline in CFR. Among 10 country-level parameters, GDP per capita ({beta}=-0.483, p=0.000), hospital beds per population ({beta}=-0.372, p<0.001), mortality from air pollution ({beta}=-0.487, p=0.003) and population density ({beta}=-0.570, p< 0.000) were significantly negatively associated while maternal mortality ratio ({beta}=0.431, p=0.000) and age ({beta}=0.635, p<0.000) were positively associated with CFR.

ConclusionsThe CFR of COVID-19 has gradually increased over time in majority of countries at various stages of the pandemic, followed by a plateau and a steady decline. Population level COVID-19 mortality burden and CFR are significantly positively associated with each other.","Chaubal, R.; Kannan, S.; Khattry, N.; Gupta, S.",2020-10-06,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.04.20206599,1,Sudeep Gupta,"Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Centre & Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.04.20206599v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.04.20206599v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"

12826,"Reconciling epidemiological models with misclassified case-counts for SARS-CoV-2 with seroprevalence surveys: A case study in Delhi, India","Underreporting of COVID-19 cases and deaths is a hindrance to correctly modeling and monitoring the pandemic. This is primarily due to limited testing, lack of reporting infrastructure and a large number of asymptomatic infections. In addition, diagnostic tests (RT-PCR tests for detecting current infection) and serological antibody tests for IgG (to assess past infections) are imperfect. In particular, the diagnostic tests have a high false negative rate. Epidemiologic models with a latent compartment for unascertained infections like the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) models can provide predictions for unreported cases and deaths under certain assumptions. Typically, the number of unascertained cases is unobserved and thus we cannot validate these estimates for a real study except for simulation studies. Population-based seroprevalence studies can provide a rough estimate of the total number of infections and help us check epidemiologic model projections. In this paper, we develop a method to account for high false negative rates in RT-PCR in an extension to the classic SEIR model. We apply this method to Delhi, the national capital region of India, with a population of 19.8 million and a COVID-19 hotspot of the country, obtaining estimates of underreporting factor for cases at 34-53 times and that for deaths at 8-13 times. Based on a recently released serological survey for Delhi with an estimated 22.86% seroprevalence, we compute adjusted estimates of the true number of infections reported by the survey (after accounting for misclassification of the antibody test results) which is largely consistent with the model outputs, yielding an underreporting factor for cases from 30-42. Together with the model and the serosurvey, this implies approximately 96-98% cases in Delhi remained unreported and whereas only 109,140 cases were reported on July 10, the true number of infections varied somewhere between 4.4-4.6 million across different estimates. While repeated serological monitoring is resource intensive, model-based adjustments, run with the most up to date data, can provide a viable option to keep track of the unreported cases and deaths and gauge the true extent of transmission of this insidious virus.","Bhattacharyya, R.; Bhaduri, R.; Kundu, R.; Salvatore, M.; Mukherjee, B.",2020-08-04,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.07.31.20166249,1,Bhramar Mukherjee,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.31.20166249v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.31.20166249v1.full.pdf,cc_by,"NA"
4417,Smoking is Associated with COVID-19 Progression: A Meta-Analysis,"ObjectiveTo determine the association between smoking and progression of COVID-19.

DesignA meta-analysis of 12 published papers.

Data SourcePubMed database was searched on April 6, 2020.

Eligibility criteria and data analysisWe included studies reporting smoking behavior of COVID-19 patients and progression of disease. Search terms included """"smoking"""", """"smoker*"""", """"characteristics"""", """"risk factors"""", """"outcomes"""", and """"COVID-19"""", """"COVID"""", """"coronavirus"""", """"sar cov-2"""", """"sar cov 2"""". There were no language limitations. One author extracted information for each study, screened the abstract or the full text, with questions resolved through discussion among both authors. A random effects meta-analysis was applied.

Main Outcome MeasuresThe study outcome was progression of COVID-19 among people who already had the disease.

ResultsWe identified 12 papers with a total of 9,025 COVID-19 patients, 878 (9.7%) with severe disease and 495 with a history of smoking (5.5%). The meta-analysis showed a significant association between smoking and progression of COVID-19 (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.49-3.39, p=0.001). Limitations in the 12 papers suggest that the actual risk of smoking may be higher.

ConclusionsSmoking is a risk factor for progression of COVID-19, with smokers having higher odds of COVID-19 progression than never smokers. Physicians and public health professionals should collect data on smoking as part of clinical management and add smoking cessation to the list of practices to blunt the COVID-19 pandemic.

21676,Is vitamin D deficiency associated with the COVID-19 epidemic in Europe?,"ObjectiveCOVID-19 has emerged as a global pandemic, affecting nearly 80 million people from 218 countries as of December 2020. At the same time, vitamin D deficiency seems to be prevalent among COVID-19 patients. Hence, the association between the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 infection and mortality among European countries was examined.

DesignA case series and recent literature review study

SettingsInformation on prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in each country was retrieved through literature searching on PubMed(R) database. As of December, 23rd 2020, COVID-19 infections and mortalities per million population were extracted from the Worldometer website, whereas the latitude of each country was taken from the CSGNetwork website. The association between both vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 infection and mortality were explored using correlation coefficients and scatterplots.

ParticipantsEuropean Countries-Populations

ResultsThe range of prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among European countries was 6.9-75.1%, with most countries facing more than 50% of vitamin D deficiency among their population. Significant positive correlations were observed between COVID-19 infections (r=0.82; p<0.001) and mortalities (r=0.53; p=0.05) per million population with the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Most of the high latitude countries showed lower rates of COVID-19 infections and mortalities compared to middle latitude countries.

ConclusionPrevalence of vitamin D deficiency was significantly associated with both infection and mortality rate of COVID-19 among European countries.

13062,Development of mass spectrometry-based targeted assay for direct detection of novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus from clinical specimens,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has overwhelmed health systems worldwide and highlighted limitations of diagnostic testing. Several types of diagnostics including RT-PCR-based assays, antigen detection by lateral flow assays and antibody-based assays have been developed and deployed in a short time. However, many of these assays are lacking in sensitivity and/or specificity. Here, we describe an immunoaffinity purification followed by high resolution mass spectrometry-based targeted assay capable of detecting viral antigen in nasopharyngeal swab samples of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Based on our discovery experiments using purified virus, recombinant viral protein and nasopharyngeal swab samples from COVID-19 positive patients, nucleocapsid protein was selected as a target antigen. We then developed an automated antibody capture-based workflow coupled to targeted high-field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) - parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) assays on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer. An ensemble machine learning-based model for determining COVID-19 positive samples was created using fragment ion intensities in the PRM data. This resulted in 97.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity with RT-PCR-based molecular testing as the gold standard.

9246,Dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the earliest-affected areas in Italy: 1 Mass screening for SARS-CoV-2 serological positivity (SARS-2-SCREEN).,"BackgroundSeveral municipalities in the Lombardy Region have been affected by the SARS-CoV-2 infection since the earliest stages of the epidemic. To date, 89442 confirmed cases have been diagnosed in Lombardy, and mortality in several municipalities has already surpassed that of the past decade. Currently, the true extent of the SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown as several affected subjects may have been asymptomatic or have presented mild disease, thus not resulting in the identified COVID-19 cases.

MethodsThis cross-sectional study aims to define the spread of infection within the population by determining the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 by rapid immunochromatographic testing and subsequent confirmation by serology on venous blood by liquid phase immunochemical testing, also allowing to compare the two methods. Testing will be performed on adults and minors residing, domiciled or working in several municipalities of the Lombardy Region, involved in the initial stages of the epidemic. The study will include rapid finger-prick testing and venous sampling for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and nasopharyngeal swabbing (NPS). Concurrent notification of test results will occur via the regional healthcare information system (SISS).

DiscussionThis study was developed with the desire to understand the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the epidemiological transmission characteristics of this virus. Understanding the spread and severity of the disease could help in the implementation of effective infection surveillance containment and countermeasures facilitating the identification of cases that have been exposed to the virus and the traceability of contacts.

5345,Organising outpatient dialysis services during the COVID-19 pandemic. A simulation and mathematical modelling study.,"BackgroundThis study presents two simulation modelling tools to support the organisation of networks of dialysis services during the COVID-19 pandemic. These tools were developed to support renal services in the South of England (the Wessex region caring for 650 patients), but are applicable elsewhere.

MethodsA discrete-event simulation was used to model a worst case spread of COVID-19 (80% infected over three months), to stress-test plans for dialysis provision throughout the COVID-19 outbreak. We investigated the ability of the system to manage the mix of COVID-19 positive and negative patients, and examined the likely effects on patients, outpatient workloads across all units, and inpatient workload at the centralised COVID-positive inpatient unit. A second Monte-Carlo vehicle routing model estimated the feasibility of patient transport plans and relaxing the current policy of single COVID-19 patient transport to allow up to four infected patients at a time.

ResultsIf current outpatient capacity is maintained there is sufficient capacity in the South of England to keep COVID-19 negative/recovered and positive patients in separate sessions, but rapid reallocation of patients may be needed (as sessions are cleared of negative/recovered patients to enable that session to be dedicated to positive patients). Outpatient COVID-19 cases will spillover to a secondary site while other sites will experience a reduction in workload. The primary site chosen to manage infected patients will experience a significant increase in outpatients and in-patients. At the peak of infection, it is predicted there will be up to 140 COVID-19 positive patients with 40 to 90 of these as inpatients, likely breaching current inpatient capacity (and possibly leading to a need for temporary movement of dialysis equipment).

Patient transport services will also come under considerable pressure. If patient transport operates on a policy of one positive patient at a time, and two-way transport is needed, a likely scenario estimates 80 ambulance drive time hours per day (not including fixed drop-off and ambulance cleaning times). Relaxing policies on individual patient transport to 2-4 patients per trip can save 40-60% of drive time. In mixed urban/rural geographies steps may need to be taken to temporarily accommodate renal COVID-19 positive patients closer to treatment facilities.

ConclusionsDiscrete-event simulation simulation and Monte-Carlo vehicle routing model provides a useful method for stress-testing inpatient and outpatient clinical systems prior to peak COVID-19 workloads.","Allen, M.; Bhanji, A.; Willemsen, J.; Dudfield, S.; Logan, S.; Monks, T.",2020-04-27,Nephrology,10.1101/2020.04.22.20075457,1,Thomas Monks,University of Exeter,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20075457v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20075457v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1371/journal.pone.0237628

Rapidly increasing infections has raised intense world-wide attention. How to model the evolution of COVID-19 effectively and efficiently is of great significance for prevention and control.

MethodsWe propose the multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model based on the original single-chain model in [8] to describe the evolution of COVID-19 in Singapore. Multi-chains can be considered as the superposition of several single chains with different characteristics. We identify parameters of models by minimizing the penalty function.

ResultsThe numerical simulation results exhibit the multichain model performs well on data fitting. Though unsteady the increments are, they could still fall within the range of {+/-}25% fluctuation from simulation results. It is predicted by multi-chain models that Singapore are experiencing a nonnegligible risk of explosive outbreak, thus stronger measures are urgently needed to contain the epidemic.

ConclusionThe multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model provides an effective way to early detect the appearance of imported infectors and super spreaders and forecast a second outbreak. It can also explain the data in those countries where the single-chain model shows deviation from the data.","Pan, H.; Shao, N.; Yan, Y.; Luo, X.; Wang, S.; Ye, L.; Cheng, J.; Chen, W.",2020-04-17,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.13.20063792,1,Wenbin Chen,Fudan University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063792v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063792v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1007/s40484-020-0224-3
19360,"How do the public interpret COVID-19 swab test results? Comparing the impact of official information about results and reliability used in the UK, US and New Zealand: a randomised, controlled trial","ObjectivesTo assess the effects of different official information on public interpretation of a personal COVID-19 PCR ( swab) test result.

DesignA 5xx2 factorial, randomised, between-subjects experiment, comparing four wordings of information about the test result and a control arm of no additional information; for both positive and negative test results.

SettingOnline experiment using recruitment platform Respondi.

ParticipantsUK participants (n=1,744, after a pilot of n=1,657) collected by quota sampling to be proportional to the UK national population on age and sex.

InterventionsParticipants were given a hypothetical COVID-19 swab test result for  John who was presented as having a 50% chance of having COVID-19 based on symptoms alone. Participants were randomised to receive either a positive or negative result for  John, then randomised again to receive either no more information, or text information on the interpretation of COVID-19 test results copied from the public websites of the UKs National Health Service, the USs Centers for Disease Control, New Zealands Ministry of Health, or a modified version of the UKs wording incorporating uncertainty. Information identifying the source of the wording was removed.

Main outcome measuresParticipants were asked """"What is your best guess as to the percent chance that John actually had COVID-19 at the time of his test, given his result?""""; questions about their feelings of trustworthiness in the result, their perceptions of the quality of the underlying evidence, and what action they felt  John should take in the light of his result.

ResultsOf those presented with a positive COVID-19 test result for  John, the mean estimate of the probability that he had the virus was 73%; for those presented with a negative result, 38%. There was no main effect of information (wording) on these means. However, those participants given the official information on the UK website, which did not mention any uncertainty around the test result, were significantly more likely to give a categorical (100% or 0%) answer (for positive result, p <.001; negative, p =.006). When asked how much they agreed that  John should self-isolate, those who were told his test was positive agreed to a greater extent (mean 86 on a 0-100 scale), but many of those who were told he had a negative result still agreed (mean 51). There was also an interaction between wording and test result (p < 0.001), with those seeing the New Zealand wording about the uncertainties of the test result significantly more likely to agree that he should continue to self-isolate after a negative test than those who saw the UK wording (p =.01), the experimental wording (p =.02) or no wording at all (p =.003). Participants rated positive test results more trustworthy and higher quality of evidence than negative results.

ConclusionsThe UK public perceive positive test results for COVID-19 as more reliable and trustworthy than negative results without being given any information about the reliability of the tests. When additionally given the UKs current official wording about the interpretation of the test results, people became more likely to interpret the results as definitive. The publics assessment of the face value of both the positive and negative test results was generally conservative. The proportion of participants who felt that a symptomatic individual who tests negative definitely should not self-isolate was highest among those reading the UK wording (17.4%) and lowest among those reading the New Zealand wording (3.8%) and US wording (5.1%).

What is already known on this topicO_LIDifferent countries have had different approaches to conveying the meaning of a COVID-19 swab test result, particularly regarding the uncertainties inherent in the result due to limitations of specificity and sensitivity.
C_LIO_LIPrevious research has suggested that peoples trust and understanding is not affected by conveying quantified uncertainties numerically, but that perceptions of the quality of the underlying evidence can affect trust.
C_LIO_LIIt is not known whether the different wordings around COVID-19 test uncertainties are likely to affect peoples trust in, or behavioural response to, the results they receive.
C_LI

What this study addsO_LIThis study provides the first empirical evidence to our knowledge of the responses the public have to COVID-19 swab test results.
C_LIO_LIIt suggests that the public have a higher degree of trust and confidence in positive swab test results than negative when they are not given any other information accompanying the result. The experimental wording that we created for this study appeared to boost their trust in and assessment of quality of positive test results, but did not change their lower ratings of negative results.
C_LIO_LIThe wording used by the UKs National Health Service, which does not include any cues of uncertainty in the result, was more likely to lead people to definitive (100% or 0%) answers to questions about the meaning of the result.
C_LIO_LIThe wording used by New Zealands Ministry of Health, which is more explicit about the reliability of the tests, appears to lead people to be more cautious about recommending that a test participant with a negative test (but still symptomatic) no longer needs to self-isolate.

13110,Infection fatality risk for SARS-CoV-2: a nationwide seroepidemiological study in the non-institutionalized population of Spain,"ObjectiveTo estimate the range of the age- and sex-specific infection fatality risk (IFR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths and excess all-cause deaths.

DesignNationwide population-based seroepidemiological study combined with two national surveillance systems.

Setting and participantsNon-institutionalized Spanish population of all ages.

Main outcome measuresThe range of IFR was calculated as the observed number of COVID-19 deaths and excess deaths divided by the estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the non-institutionalized Spanish population. Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths were obtained from the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE) and excess all-cause deaths from the Monitoring Mortality System (MoMo) up to July 15, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infections were derived from the estimated seroprevalence by a chemiluminiscent microparticle immunoassay for IgG antibodies in 61,092 participants in the ENE-COVID nationwide serosurvey between April 27 and June 22, 2020.

ResultsThe overall IFR (95% confidence interval) was 0.8% (0.8% to 0.9%) for confirmed COVID-19 deaths and 1.1% (1.0% to 1.2%) for excess deaths. The IFR ranged between 1.1% (1.0% to 1.2%) and 1.4% (1.3% to 1.5%) in men and between 0.6% (0.5% to 0.6%) and 0.8% (0.7% to 0.8%) in women. The IFR increased sharply after age 50, ranging between 11.6% (8.1% to 16.5%) and 16.4% (11.4% to 23.2%) in men [&ge;]80 years and between 4.6% (3.4% to 6.3%) and 6.5% (4.7% to 8.8%) in women [&ge;]80 years.

ConclusionThe sharp increase in SARS-CoV-2 IFR after age 50 was more marked in men than in women. Fatality from COVID-19 is substantially greater than that reported for other common respiratory diseases such as seasonal influenza.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICInfection fatality risk (IFR) for SARS-CoV-2 is a key indicator for policy decision making, but its magnitude remains under debate. Case fatality risk, which accounts for deaths among confirmed COVID-19 cases, overestimates SARS-CoV-2 fatality as it excludes a large proportion of asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic infections. Population-based seroepidemiological studies are a valuable tool to properly estimate the number of infected individuals, regardless of symptoms. Also, because ascertainment of deaths due to COVID-19 is often incomplete, the calculation of the IFR should be complemented with data on excess all-cause mortality. In addition, data on age- and sex-specific IFR are scarce, even though age and sex are well known modifiers of the clinical evolution of COVID-19.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSUsing the ENE-COVID nationwide serosurvey and two national surveillance systems in Spain, this study provides a range of age- and sex-specific IFR estimates for SARS-CoV-2 based on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths and excess all-cause deaths. The risk of death was very low among infected individuals younger than 50 years, but it increased sharply with age, particularly among men. In the oldest age group ([&ge;]80 years), it was estimated that 12% to 16% of infected men and 5% to 6% of infected women died during the first epidemic wave.","Pastor-Barriuso, R.; Perez-Gomez, B.; Hernan, M.

22809,Informing patients that they are at high risk for serious complications of viral infection increases vaccination rates,"For many vaccine-preventable diseases like influenza, vaccination rates are lower than optimal to achieve community protection. Those at high risk for infection and serious complications are especially advised to be vaccinated to protect themselves. Using influenza as a model, we studied one method of increasing vaccine uptake: informing high-risk patients, identified by a machine learning model, about their risk status. Patients (N=39,717) were evenly randomized to (1) a control condition (exposure only to standard direct mail or patient portal vaccine promotion efforts) or to be told via direct mail, patient portal, and/or SMS that they were (2) at high risk for influenza and its complications if not vaccinated; (3) at high risk according to a review of their medical records; or (4) at high risk according to a computer algorithm analysis of their medical records. Patients in the three treatment conditions were 5.7% more likely to get vaccinated during the 112 days post-intervention (p < .001), and did so 1.4 days earlier (p < .001), on average, than those in the control group. There were no significant differences among risk messages, suggesting that patients are neither especially averse to nor uniquely appreciative of learning their records had been reviewed or that computer algorithms were involved. Similar approaches should be considered for COVID-19 vaccination campaigns.","Shermohammed, M.; Goren, A.; Lanyado, A.; Yesharim, R.; Wolk, D. M.; Doyle, J.; Meyer, M. N.; Chabris, C.

10505,Clinical course and potential predictive factors for pneumonia of adult patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): a retrospective observational analysis of 193 confirmed cases in Thailand,"BackgroundClinical spectrum of COVID-19 has been unclear, especially with regard to the presence of pneumonia. We aimed to present clinical course of all laboratory-confirmed adult COVID-19 patients and to identify potential predicting factors of pneumonia.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective study among adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Thailand, regardless of their disease severity, between January 8 and April 16, 2020. We described the full picture of COVID-19, defined definite outcomes and evaluated factors associated with pneumonia.

ResultsOne-hundred-and-ninety-three patients were included. The median (IQR) age was 37.0 (29.0-53.0) years, and 58.5% were male. Of whom, 189 (97.9%) recovered and 4 (2.1%) died. More than half (56%) of the patients were mild, 22% were moderate, 14% were severe, and 3% were critically ill. Asymptomatic infection was found in 5%. The overall incidence of pneumonia was 39%. Bilateral was more prevalent than unilateral pneumonia (65% vs. 35%). Increasing age (OR 2.60 for every 10-year increase from 30 years old; 95% CI, 1.68 to 3.97; p<0.001), obesity (OR 9.17; 95% CI, 2.11 to 39.89; p=0.003), and higher temperature at presentation (OR 4.66 per one-degree Celsius increase from 37.2 degree Celsius; 95% CI, 2.32 to 9.34; p<0.001) were potential predicting factors of COVID-19 pneumonia. Severe cases had a longer viral RNA shedding duration than the non-severe cases. The longest observed duration of viral RNA shedding was 45 days.

ConclusionAcross different disease severities, most patients with COVID-19 in Thailand had a good prognosis. COVID-19 pneumonia was found in one-third of the hospitalized patients.

Potential predicting factors included old age, obesity, fever at presentation.","Pongpirul, W.

18245,"Performance of Saliva, Oropharyngeal Swabs, and Nasal Swabs for SARS-CoV-2 Molecular Detection: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","BackgroundNasopharyngeal (NP) swabs are considered the highest-yield sample for diagnostic testing for respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The need to increase capacity for SARS-CoV-2 testing in a variety of settings, combined with shortages of sample collection supplies, have motivated a search for alternative sample types with high sensitivity. We systematically reviewed the literature to understand the performance of alternative sample types compared to NP swabs.

MethodsWe systematically searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv (last retrieval October 1st, 2020) for comparative studies of alternative specimen types [saliva, oropharyngeal (OP), and nasal (NS) swabs] versus NP swabs for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). A logistic-normal random-effects meta-analysis was performed to calculate % positive alternative-specimen, % positive NP, and % dual positives overall and in sub-groups. The QUADAS 2 tool was used to assess bias.

ResultsFrom 1,253 unique citations, we identified 25 saliva, 11 NS, 6 OP, and 4 OP/NS studies meeting inclusion criteria. Three specimen types captured lower % positives [NS (0.82, 95% CI: 0.73-0.90), OP (0.84, 95% CI: 0.57-1.0), saliva (0.88, 95% CI: 0.81 - 0.93)] than NP swabs, while combined OP/NS matched NP performance (0.97, 95% CI: 0.90-1.0). Absence of RNA extraction (saliva) and utilization of a more sensitive NAAT (NS) substantially decreased alternative-specimen yield.

ConclusionsNP swabs remain the gold standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, although alternative specimens are promising. Much remains unknown about the impact of variations in specimen collection, processing protocols, and population (pediatric vs. adult, late vs. early in disease course) and head-to head studies of sampling strategies are urgently needed.","Lee, R.

17573,The power and limitations of genomics to track COVID-19 outbreaks: a case study from New Zealand,"BackgroundReal-time genomic sequencing has played a major role in tracking the global spread and local transmission of SARS-CoV-2, contributing greatly to disease mitigation strategies. After effectively eliminating the virus, New Zealand experienced a second outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in August 2020. During this August outbreak, New Zealand utilised genomic sequencing in a primary role to support its track and trace efforts for the first time, leading to a second successful elimination of the virus.

MethodsWe generated the genomes of 80% of the laboratory-confirmed samples of SARS-CoV-2 from New Zealands August 2020 outbreak and compared these genomes to the available global genomic data.

FindingsGenomic sequencing was able to rapidly identify that the new COVID-19 cases in New Zealand belonged to a single cluster and hence resulted from a single introduction. However, successful identification of the origin of this outbreak was impeded by substantial biases and gaps in global sequencing data.

InterpretationAccess to a broader and more heterogenous sample of global genomic data would strengthen efforts to locate the source of any new outbreaks.

FundingThis work was funded by the Ministry of Health of New Zealand, New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment COVID-19 Innovation Acceleration Fund (CIAF-0470), ESR Strategic Innovation Fund and the New Zealand Health Research Council (20/1018 and 20/1041).","Geoghegan, J.

20572,Evaluation of serological lateral flow assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2,"BackgroundCOVID-19 has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Lateral flow assays can detect anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies to monitor transmission. However, standardized evaluation of their accuracy and tools to aid in interpreting results are needed.

MethodsWe evaluated 20 IgG and IgM assays selected from available tests in April 2020. We evaluated the assays performance using 56 pre-pandemic negative and 56 SARS-CoV-2-positive plasma samples, collected 10-40 days after symptom onset, confirmed by a molecular test and analyzed by an ultra-sensitive immunoassay. Finally, we developed a user-friendly web app to extrapolate the positive predictive values based on their accuracy and local prevalence.

ResultsCombined IgG+IgM sensitivities ranged from 33.9% to 94.6%, while combined specificities ranged from 92.6% to 100%. The highest sensitivities were detected in Lumiquick for IgG (98.2%), BioHit for both IgM (96.4%), and combined IgG+IgM sensitivity (94.6%). Furthermore, 11 LFAs and 8 LFAs showed perfect specificity for IgG and IgM, respectively, with 15 LFAs showing perfect combined IgG+IgM specificity. Lumiquick had the lowest estimated limit-of-detection (LOD) (0.1 g/mL), followed by a similar LOD of 1.5 g/mL for CareHealth, Cellex, KHB, and Vivachek.

ConclusionWe provide a public resource of the accuracy of select lateral flow assays with potential for home testing. The cost-effectiveness, scalable manufacturing process, and suitability for self-testing makes LFAs an attractive option for monitoring disease prevalence and assessing vaccine responsiveness. Our web tool provides an easy-to-use interface to demonstrate the impact of prevalence and test accuracy on the positive predictive values.","Trombetta, B. A.; Kandigian, S. E.; Kitchen, R.

14865,The impact of COVID-19 on the lives and mental health of Australian adolescents,"ObjectiveThere has been significant disruption to the lives and mental health of adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the exact nature of the effects is not known. The purpose of this study was to assess the psychological and lifestyle impact of the pandemic on Australian adolescents, using an online survey, administered during and after the peak of the outbreak (June-July 2020).

MethodSelf-report surveys were administered online to a sample of 760 Australian adolescents aged 12-18 years old. Surveys assessed worry about contracting COVID-19, behavioral change in response to the pandemic, impact on education, peer and family relationships, lifestyle factors including exercise, technology use and sleep, as well as mental health outcomes including psychological distress, loneliness, health anxiety and wellbeing.

ResultsOverall, young people expressed significant concern and worry about contracting the virus, and most (>85%) engaged in behaviors to reduce the risk of transmission. Three quarters of the sample reported a worsening of their mental health since the pandemic began, with negative impacts reported by most respondents on learning, friendships and family relationships. More than 40% of young people reported a decrease in exercise and 70% reported an increase in technology use since the outbreak. There were high levels of uncertainty about the future reported by respondents, and their scores on validated measures indicated higher levels of sleep disturbance, psychological distress and health anxiety, and lower levels of wellbeing, relative to normative samples. Reponses on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale indicated that 48.3% of the sample were experiencing distress consistent with a probable mental illness, which is much higher than pre-pandemic prevalence rates. Effects on mental health were worse among those who reported a previous diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety relative to those without a history of depression and/or anxiety.

ConclusionThese results indicate high levels of disruption and psychological distress experienced by adolescents during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescents are already vulnerable to the onset of mental illness at this developmental stage, and the current research underscores the need to find rapid and accessible ways to support adolescent mental health during times of crisis. There is a need for longitudinal research to evaluate the enduring effects of the pandemic on adolescents.","Li, S.; Beames, J.; Newby, J.; Maston, K.; Christensen, H.; Werner-Seidler, A.",2020-09-09,Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology,10.1101/2020.09.07.20190124,1,Aliza Werner-Seidler,"Black Dog Institute, UNSW Sydney",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.07.20190124v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.07.20190124v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1007/s00787-021-01790-x

11767,Estimating the size of undetected cases of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Europe: An upper bound estimator,"BackgroundWhile the number of detected SARS-CoV-2 infections are widely available, an understanding of the extent of undetected cases is urgently needed for an effective tackling of the pandemic. The aim of this work is to estimate the true number of SARS-CoV-2 (detected and undetected) infections in several European Countries. The question being asked is: How many cases have actually occurred?

MethodsWe propose an upper bound estimator under cumulative data distributions, in an open population, based on a day-wise estimator that allows for heterogeneity. The estimator is data-driven and can be easily computed from the distributions of daily cases and deaths. Uncertainty surrounding the estimates is obtained using bootstrap methods.

ResultsWe focus on the ratio of the total estimated cases to the observed cases at April 17th. Differences arise at the Country level, and we get estimates ranging from the 3.93 times of Norway to the 7.94 times of France. Accurate estimates are obtained, as bootstrap-based intervals are rather narrow.

ConclusionsMany parametric or semi-parametric models have been developed to estimate the population size from aggregated counts leading to an approximation of the missed population and/or to the estimate of the threshold under which the number of missed people cannot fall (i.e. a lower bound). Here, we provide a methodological contribution introducing an upper bound estimator and provide reliable estimates on the dark number, i.e. how many undetected cases are going around for several European Countries, where the epidemic spreads differently.","Rocchetti, I.; Boehning, D.; Holling, H.; Maruotti, A.",2020-07-17,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.14.20153445,1,Dankmar Boehning,University of Southampton,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20153445v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20153445v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1515/em-2020-0024
22733,"Factors influencing self-harm thoughts and self-harm behaviours over the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: a longitudinal analysis of 49,324 adults","BackgroundThere is concern that the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath will result in excess suicides by increasing known risk factors such as self-harm, but evidence on how pandemic-related risk factors contribute to changes in these outcomes is lacking.

AimsTo examine how different COVID-19-related adverse experiences and adversity worries contribute to changes in self-harm thoughts and behaviours.

MethodData from 49,324 UK adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study were analysed (1 April 2020 to 17 May 2021). Fixed effects regressions explored associations between weekly within-person variation in five categories of adversity experiences and adversity worries with changes in self-harm thoughts and behaviours across age groups (18-29, 30-44, 45-59, and 60+ years).

Results26.1% and 7.9% respondents reported self-harm thoughts and behaviours, respectively, at least once over the study period. More adverse experiences were more strongly related to outcomes than worries. Amongst all age groups, the largest specific adversity contributing to increases in both self-harm thoughts (odds ratio (OR) range = 3.37 to 3.90) and behaviours (OR range = 3.39 to 6.96) was having experienced physical or psychological abuse. Having had COVID-19 and financial worries were also associated with increased likelihood of both outcomes.

ConclusionsFindings suggest that a significant portion of UK adults may be at increased risk for self-harm thoughts and behaviours during the pandemic. Given the likelihood that the economic and social consequences of the pandemic will accumulate, policy makers can begin adapting evidence-based suicide prevention strategies and other social policies to help mitigate its consequences.","Paul, E.; Fancourt, D.",2021-06-03,Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology,10.1101/2021.02.19.21252050,2,Elise Paul,University College London,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.19.21252050v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.19.21252050v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"

Up until March 23, 2020, the confirmed cases in 173 countries and regions of the globe had surpassed 346,000, and more than 14,700 deaths had resulted. The confirmed cases outside of China had also reached over 81,000, with over 3,200 deaths. In this study, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was proposed to analyze and predict the number of confirmed cases. Several cities with the most confirmed cases in China were the focus of this study, and a COVID-19 forecasting model, based on the CNN deep neural network method, was proposed. To compare the overall efficacies of different algorithms, the indicators of mean absolute error and root mean square error were applied in the experiment of this study. The experiment results indicated that compared with other deep learning methods, the CNN model proposed in this study has the greatest prediction efficacy. The feasibility and practicality of the model in predicting the cumulative number of COVID-19 confirmed cases were also verified in this study.","Huang, C.-J.; Chen, Y.-H.; Ma, Y.; Kuo, P.-H.",2020-03-27,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.23.20041608,1,Ping-Huan Kuo,National Pingtung University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041608v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041608v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
22066,Risk Factors for Infection and Health Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic in People with Autoimmune Diseases,"BackgroundPeople with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions who take immunomodulatory/suppressive medications may have a higher risk of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Chronic disease care has also changed for many patients, with uncertain downstream consequences.

ObjectiveAssess whether COVID-19 risk is higher among those on immunomodulating or suppressive agents and characterize pandemic-associated changes to care.

DesignLongitudinal registry study

Participants4666 individuals with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions followed by specialists in neurology, rheumatology, cardiology, pulmonology or gastroenterology at Johns Hopkins

MeasurementsPeriodic surveys querying comorbidities, disease-modifying medications, exposures, COVID-19 testing and outcomes, social behaviors, and disruptions to healthcare

ResultsA total of 265 (5.6%) developed COVID-19 over 9 months of follow-up (April-December 2020). Patient characteristics (age, race, comorbidity, medication exposure) were associated with differences in social distancing behaviors during the pandemic. Glucocorticoid exposure was associated with higher odds of COVID-19 in multivariable models incorporating behavior and other potential confounders (OR: 1.43; 95%CI: 1.08, 1.89). Other medication classes were not associated with COVID-19 risk. Diabetes (OR: 1.72; 95%CI: 1.08, 2.73), cardiovascular disease (OR: 1.68; 95%CI: 1.24, 2.28), and chronic kidney disease (OR: 1.76; 95%CI: 1.04, 2.97) were each associated with higher odds of COVID-19. Pandemic-related disruption to care was common. Of the 2156 reporting pre-pandemic utilization of infusion, mental health or rehabilitative services, 975 (45.2%) reported disruptions. Individuals experiencing changes to employment or income were at highest odds of care disruption.

LimitationsResults may not be generalizable to all patients with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Information was self-reported.

ConclusionsExposure to glucocorticoids may increase risk of COVID-19 in people with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Disruption to healthcare and related services was common. Those with pandemic-related reduced income may be most vulnerable to care disruptions.","Fitzgerald, K. C.; Mecoli, C. A.; Douglas, M.; Harris, S.; Aravidis, B.; Albayda, J.; Hoke, A.; Sotirchos, E.

26126,The Physiologic Response to COVID-19 Vaccination,"Two mRNA vaccines and one adenovirus-based vaccine against SARS CoV-2 are currently being distributed at scale in the United States. Objective evidence of a specific individuals physiologic response to that vaccine are not routinely tracked but may offer insights into the acute immune response and personal and/or vaccine characteristics associated with that. We explored this possibility using a smartphone app-based research platform developed early in the pandemic that enabled volunteers (38,911 individuals between 25 March 2020 and 4 April 2021) to share their smartwatch and activity tracker data, as well as self-report, when appropriate, any symptoms, COVID-19 test results and vaccination dates and type. Of 4,110 individuals who reported at least one mRNA vaccination dose, 3,312 provided adequate resting heart rate data from the peri-vaccine period for analysis. We found changes in resting heart rate with respect to an individual baseline increased the days after vaccination, peaked on day 2, and returned to normal on day 6, with a much stronger effect after second dose with respect to first dose (average changes 1.6 versus 0.5 beats per minute). The changes were more pronounced for individuals who received the Moderna vaccine (on both doses), those who previously tested positive to COVID-19 (on dose 1), and for individuals aged <40 years, after adjusting for possible confounding factors. Taking advantage of continuous passive data from personal sensors could potentially enable the identification of a digital fingerprint of inflammation, which might prove useful as a surrogate for vaccine-induced immune response.","Quer, G.; Gadaleta, M.; Radin, J.

12953,Impacts of people's learning behavior in fighting the COVID-19 epidemic,"This work presents a mathematical model that captures time-dependent social-distancing effects and presents examples of the consequences of relaxing social-distancing restrictions in the fight against the novel coronavirus epidemic. Without social distancing, the spread of COVID-19 will grow exponentially, but social distancing and peoples learning behavior (isolating, staying at home, wearing face masks, washing hands, restricting the size and frequency of group gatherings, etc.) can significantly impede the epidemic spread, flatten the infection curve, and change the final outcome of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results demonstrate that strict social distancing and peoples learning behavior can be effective in slowing the spread rate and significantly reducing the total number of infections, daily infection rate, peak of daily infections, and duration of the epidemic. Under strict social distancing, the rise and fall of infections would be nearly symmetric about the peak of of daily infections, and the epidemic spread would be essentially over within 60 days. Relaxing social distancing and people learning behaviors will significantly increase the total and daily numbers of infections and prolong the course of the outbreak. These results have immediate applications for the implementation of various social-distancing policies and general significance for ongoing outbreaks and similar infectious disease epidemics in the future (LA-UR 20-22877).

25123,Emergence of multiple SARS-CoV-2 antibody escape variants in an immunocompromised host undergoing convalescent plasma treatment,"SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concerns (VOC), e.g., B.1.351 (20H/501Y.V2) and P1 (20J/501Y.V3), harboring N-terminal domain (NTD) or the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (e.g., E484K) mutations, exhibit reduced in vitro susceptibility to convalescent serum, commercial antibody cocktails, and vaccine neutralization, and have been associated with reinfection. The accumulation of these mutations could be the consequence of intra-host viral evolution due to prolonged infection in immunocompromised hosts. In this study, we document the microevolution of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from sequential tracheal aspirates from an immunosuppressed patient on tacrolimus, steroids and convalescent plasma therapy, and identify the emergence of multiple NTD and RBD mutations associated with reduced antibody neutralization as early as three weeks after infection. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the first swab (Day 0) and three tracheal aspirates (Day 7, 21 and 27) were compared at the sequence level. We identified five different S protein mutations at the NTD or RBD regions from the second tracheal aspirate sample (21 Day). The S:Q493R substitution and S:243-244LA deletion had [~]70% frequency, while ORF1a:A138T, S:141-144LGVY deletion, S:E484K and S:Q493K substitutions demonstrated [~]30%, [~]30%, [~]20% and [~]10% mutation frequency, respectively. However, the third tracheal aspirate sample collected one week later (Day 27) was predominated by the haplotype of ORF1a:A138T, S:141-144LGVY deletion and S:E484K (> 95% mutation frequency). Notably, S protein deletions (141-144LGVY and 243-244LA deletions in NTD region) and substitutions (Q493K/R and E484K in the RBD region) previously showed reduced susceptibly to monoclonal antibody or convalescent plasma. The observation supports the hypothesis that VOCs can independently arise and that immunocompromised patients on convalescent plasma therapy are potential breeding grounds for immune-escape mutants.

17843,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Candidate Chest CT Features: A Systematic Review of Extracted Imaging Features from 7571 Individuals,"Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) causing novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP), over 45 million affected cases have been reported worldwide. Many patients with COVID-19 have involvement of their respiratory system. According to studies in the radiology literature, chest computed tomography (CT) is recommended in suspected cases for initial detection, evaluating the disease progression and monitoring the response to therapy. The aim of this article is to review the most frequently reported imaging features in COVID-19 patients in order to provide a reliable insight into expected CT imaging manifestations in patients with positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results, and also for the initial detection of patients with suspicious clinical presentation whose RT-PCR test results are false negative. A total of 60 out of 173 initial COVID-19 studies, comprising 7571 individuals, were identified by searching PubMed database for articles published between the months of January and June 2020. The data of these studies were related to patients from China, Japan, Italy, USA, Iran and Singapore. Among 40 reported features, presence of ground glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, bilateral lung involvement and peripheral distribution are the most frequently observed ones, reported in 100%, 91.7%, 85%, and 83.3% of articles, respectively. In a similar way, we extracted CT imaging studies of similar pulmonary syndromes outbreaks caused by other strains of coronavirus family: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). For MERS and SARS, 2 out of 21 and 5 out of 153 initially retrieved studies had CT findings, respectively. Herein, we have indicated the most common coronavirus family related and COVID-19 specific features. Presence of GGO, consolidation, bilateral lung involvement and peripheral distribution were the features reported in at least 83% of COVID-19 articles, while air bronchogram, multi-lobe involvement and linear opacity were the three potential COVID-19 specific CT imaging findings. This is necessary to recognize the most promising imaging features for diagnosis and follow-up of patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, we identified co-existed CT imaging features.","Zahiri, J.; Afsharinia, M.

5679,Modeling serological testing to inform relaxation of social distancing for COVID-19 control,"The value of serological testing to inform the public health response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is debated. Using a transmission model, we examined how serology can be implemented to allow seropositive individuals to resume more normal levels of social interaction while offsetting the risks. We simulated the use of widespread serological testing with realistic assay characteristics, in which seropositive individuals partially restore their social contacts and act as immunological  shields. If social distancing is relaxed by 50% at the same time that quarterly serological screening is initiated, approximately 120,000 deaths could be averted and a quarter of the US population could be released from social distancing in the first year of the epidemic, compared to a scenario without serological testing. This strategy has the potential to substantially flatten the COVID-19 epidemic curve while also allowing a substantial number of individuals to safely return to social and economic interactions.

One Sentence SummaryInforming relaxation of social distancing with serological testing can reduce population risk while offsetting some of the severe social and economic costs of a sustained shutdown.","Kraay, A.

26600,A Predictive Modelling Framework for COVID-19 Transmission to Inform the Management of Mass Events,"Modelling COVID-19 transmission at live events and public gatherings is essential to evaluate and control the probability of subsequent outbreaks. Model estimates can be used to inform event organizers about the possibility of super-spreading and the predicted efficacy of safety protocols, as well as to communicate to participants their personalised risk so that they may choose whether to attend. Yet, despite the fast-growing body of literature on COVID transmission dynamics, current risk models either neglect contextual information on vaccination rates or disease prevalence or do not attempt to quantitatively model transmission, thus limiting their potential to provide insightful estimates. This paper attempts to bridge this gap by providing informative risk metrics for live public events, along with a measure of their associated uncertainty. Starting with a thorough review of the literature and building upon existing models, our approach ties together three main components: (a) reliable modelling of the number of infectious cases at the time of the event, (b) evaluation of the efficiency of pre-event screening and risk mitigation protocols, and (c) modelling the transmission dynamics during the event. We demonstrate how uncertainty in the input parameters can be included in the model using Monte Carlo simulations. We discuss the underlying assumptions and limitations of our approach and implications for policy around live events management.","Donnat, C.; Bunbury, F.; Kreindler, J.; Filippidis, F.

7051,The impact of goggle-associated harms to health and working status of nurses during management of COVID-19,"BackgroundTo investigate the impact of goggles on their health and clinical practice during management of patients with COVID-19.

Methods231 nurse practitioners were enrolled who worked in isolation region in designated hospitals to admit patients with COVID-19 in China. Demographic data, goggle-associated symptoms and underlying reasons, incidence of medical errors or exposures, the effects of fog in goggles on practice were all collected. Data were stratified and analyzed by age or working experience. Risk factors of goggle-associated medical errors were analyzed by multivariable logistical regression analysis.

FindingsGoggle-associated symptoms and foggy goggles widely presented in nurses. The most common symptoms were headache, skin pressure injury and dizziness. Headache, vomit and nausea were significantly fewer reported in nurses with longer working experience while rash occurred higher in this group. The underlying reasons included tightness of goggles, unsuitable design and uncomfortable materials. The working status of nurses with more working experience was less impacted by goggles. 11.3% nurses occurred medical exposures in clinical practice while 19.5% nurses made medical errors on patients. The risk factors for medical errors were time interval before adapting to goggle-associated discomforts, adjusting goggles and headache.

InterpretationGoggle-associated symptoms and fog can highly impact the working status and contribute to medical errors during management of COVID-19. Increased the experience with working in PPE through adequate training and psychological education may benefit for relieving some symptoms and improving working status. Improvement of goggle design during productive process was strongly suggested to reduce incidence of discomforts and medical errors.","He, X.-H.; Feng, Y.-R.; Li, G.-M.; Pang, X.-J.; Chen, T.; Zhou, Y.-L.; Zhang, H.; Lang, J.; Li, L.-M.; Feng, L.; He, X.; Zheng, W.; Miao, H.; Wang, Y.-H.; Kang, X.",2020-05-15,Health Systems And Quality Improvement,10.1101/2020.05.11.20094854,1,Xia Kang,General Hospitalf of Western Theater Command,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.20094854v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.20094854v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"

For COVID-19 patients, cancer is a coexisting disease that should not be Here, we conducted a multicenter retrospective study to show the clinical information and outcomes of cancer patients infected with COVID-19.

MeasurementsMedical records of COVID-19 patients with cancer admitted to hospitals from Jan 5, 2020 to Feb 18, 2020 were collected.

ResultsOf the 67 patients (median age: 66 years), the median age of patients with severe illness was older than that of patients with mild symptoms (P<0.001). The proportion of severe patients had co-morbidities was higher than patients with mild disease (P=0.004). During the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia, tumor progression and recurrence was not observed for those patients still at the anticancer treatment phase. Lymphocytopenia was the main laboratory finding accompanying increased C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in cancer patients, especially in severe cases. By Mar 10, 2020, 18 (26.9%) patients died from COVID-19. The median age of survivors was younger than that of deaths (P=0.014). Lung cancer (n=15, 22.4%) was the most common cancer type and accounted for the highest proportion COVID-19 resulted deaths (33.3%, 5/15). We observed a tendency that patients at the follow-up phase had a better prognosis than that at anticancer treatment phase (P=0.095).

ConclusionThis study showed COVID-19 patients with cancer seem to have a higher proportion of severe cases and poorer prognosis.

13986,Epidemiologically most successful SARS-CoV-2 variant: concurrent mutations in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and spike protein,"The D614G mutation of the Spike protein is thought to be relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we report biological and epidemiological aspects of this mutation. Using pseudotyped lentivectors, we were able to confirm that the G614 variant of the Spike protein is markedly more infectious than the ancestral D614 variant. We demonstrate by molecular modelling that the replacement of aspartate by glycine in position 614 facilitates the transition towards an open state of the Spike protein. To understand whether the increased infectivity of the D614 variant explains its epidemiological success, we analysed the evolution of 27,086 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from GISAID. We observed striking coevolution of D614G with the P323L mutation in the viral polymerase. Importantly, exclusive presence of G614 or L323 did not become epidemiologically relevant. In contrast, the combination of the two mutations gave rise to a viral G/L variant that has all but replaced the initial D/P variant. There was no significant correlation between reported COVID mortality in different countries and the prevalence of the Wuhan versus G/L variant. However, when comparing the speed of emergence and the ultimate predominance in individual countries, the G/L variant displays major epidemiological supremacy. Our results suggest that the P323L mutation, located in the interface domain of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), is a necessary alteration that led to the epidemiological success of the present variant of SARS-CoV-2.","Ilmjärv, S.; Abdul, F.; Acosta-Gutierrez, S.; Estarellas, C.; Galdadas, I.; Casimir, M.; Alessandrini, M.; Gervasio, F.

16648,Derivation and validation of a triage tool for acutely ill adults with suspected COVID-19: The PRIEST observational cohort study,"ObjectivesWe aimed to derive and validate a triage tool, based on clinical assessment alone, for predicting adverse outcome in acutely ill adults with suspected COVID-19 infection.

MethodsWe undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 emergency departments across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected presenting data from 22445 people attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020. The primary outcome was death or organ support (respiratory, cardiovascular, or renal) by record review at 30 days. We split the cohort into derivation and validation sets, developed a clinical score based on the coefficients from multivariable analysis using the derivation set, and the estimated discriminant performance using the validation set.

ResultsWe analysed 11773 derivation and 9118 validation cases. Multivariable analysis identified that age, sex, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation/inspired oxygen ratio, performance status, consciousness, history of renal impairment, and respiratory distress were retained in analyses restricted to the ten or fewer predictors. We used findings from multivariable analysis and clinical judgement to develop a score based on the NEWS2 score, age, sex, and performance status. This had a c-statistic of 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.79-0.81) in the validation cohort and predicted adverse outcome with sensitivity 0.98 (0.97-0.98) and specificity 0.34 (0.34-0.35) for scores above four points.

ConclusionA clinical score based on NEWS2, age, sex, and performance status predicts adverse outcome with good discrimination in adults with suspected COVID-19 and can be used to support decision-making in emergency care.

19254,"Protocol for longitudinal assessment of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses in healthcare professionals in Hannover, Germa-ny: the prospective, longitudinal, observational COVID-19 Contact (CoCo) study","BackgroundDuring the current pandemic, healthcare professionals (HCP) have been at the frontline of the crisis. Serological screening may help in identifying severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) prevalence. However, given the rapidly evolving situation in spring 2020, many questions regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection risk and utility of serological testing remained unanswered. To address these questions, we initiated the COVID-19 Contact (CoCo) study at Hannover Medical School, a large university hospital in Northern Germany and affiliated care providers.

MethodsThe CoCo study is an ongoing, prospective, longitudinal, observational study in HCP and individuals with potential contact to SARS-CoV-2. It monitors anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin serum levels and collects information on symptoms of respiratory infection, work and home environment, and self-perceived SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. Inclusion criteria are (1) working as HCP in clinical care at our university centre, affiliated hospitals or private practices, (2) written informed consent and (3) age >18 years. Exclusion criteria are (1) refusal to give informed consent and (2) contraindication to venepuncture. Study participants are asked to provide weekly to six-monthly samples (7.5 ml serum and 7.5 ml EDTA blood) and fill out a questionnaire. Since March 2020, around 1250 HCP have been included in the study. At each study visit, sera are screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 1 (S1) immunoglobulin G (IgG) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Positive or borderline positive samples are re-assessed with an alternative serological test. Individual results for each study participant are made available online via a dedicated study website. This study also aims to compare different serological testing assays, as well as explore further humoral and cellular immune markers. Study protocols are continually adapted to the rapidly evolving situation of the current pandemic.

DiscussionThis ongoing prospective study will aim to answer central questions on the prevalence and kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2-humoral immune responses and the validity of serological testing of HCP in a region with high healthcare standard and comparatively low COVID-19 prevalence. As such, our results are highly relevant to other regions and may support HCP around the world in managing this unprecedented situation.

27761,Changes to household income in a Kenyan informal settlement during COVID-19,"More than a billion people live in densely-populated informal settlements worldwide. Crowded living conditions and limited resources may render these populations vulnerable to the health and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Representative and longitudinal survey data are needed to accurately measure impacts in these populations, but such data are scarce. Using satellite data and spatial sampling to ensure representativeness, we use longitudinal survey data on 1,033 households comprising 3,681 individuals collected pre- and post-pandemic to measure the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic households in six areas of the informal settlement of Kibera, Nairobi. The economic impacts are sizable and long-lasting. Household incomes declined at the start of the pandemic by 59% (95% CI: 50% to 69%) and remained 21% (95% CI: 13% to 28%) below the baseline level after six months. Respondents primarily attributed these declines in income to fewer labor market opportunities or lower demand for services, rather than the direct health impacts of the pandemic. The findings raise serious concerns about the welfare consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for residents of informal settlements.

22709,Mortality after surgery with SARS-CoV-2 infection in England: A population-wide epidemiological study,"ObjectivesTo confirm the incidence of perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated mortality after surgery.

Design and settingAnalysis of routine electronic health record data from National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England.

MethodsWe extracted data from Hospital Episode Statistics in England describing adult patients undergoing surgery between 1st January 2020 and 31st October 2020. The exposure was SARS-CoV-2 infection defined by ICD-10 codes. The primary outcome measure was 90-day in-hospital mortality. Data were analysed using multivariable logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, Charlson co-morbidity index, index of multiple deprivation, presence of cancer, surgical procedure type and admission acuity. Results are presented as n (%) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.

ResultsWe identified 1,972,153 patients undergoing surgery of whom 11,940 (0.6%) had SARS-CoV-2. In total, 19,100 (1.0%) patients died in hospital. SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a much greater risk of death (SARS-CoV-2: 2,618/11,940 [21.9%] vs No SARS-CoV-2: 16,482/1,960,213 [0.8%]; OR: 5.8 [5.5 - 6.1]; p<0.001). Amongst patients undergoing elective surgery 1,030/1,374,985 (0.1%) had SARS-CoV-2 of whom 83/1,030 (8.1%) died, compared with 1,092/1,373,955 (0.1%) patients without SARS-CoV-2 (OR: 29.0 [22.5 -37.3]; p<0.001). Amongst patients undergoing emergency surgery 9,742/437,891 (2.2%) patients had SARS-CoV-2, of whom 2,466/9,742 (25.3%) died compared with 14,817/428,149 (3.5%) patients without SARS-CoV-2 (OR: 5.7 [5.4 - 6.0]; p<0.001).

ConclusionsThe low incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHS surgical pathways suggests current infection prevention and control policies are highly effective. However, the high mortality amongst patients with SARS-CoV-2 suggests these precautions cannot be safely relaxed.

22857,Linking electronic health records for research on a nationwide cohort including over 54 million people in England,"ObjectivesDescribe a new England-wide electronic health record (EHR) resource enabling whole population research on Covid-19 and cardiovascular disease whilst ensuring data security and privacy and maintaining public trust.

DesignCohort comprising linked person-level records from national healthcare settings for the English population accessible within NHS Digitals new Trusted Research Environment.

SettingEHRs from primary care, hospital episodes, death registry, Covid-19 laboratory test results and community dispensing data, with further enrichment planned from specialist intensive care, cardiovascular and Covid-19 vaccination data.

Participants54.4 million people alive on 1st January 2020 and registered with an NHS general practitioner in England.

Main measures of interestConfirmed and suspected Covid-19 diagnoses, exemplar cardiovascular conditions (incident stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and incident myocardial infarction (MI)) and all-cause mortality between 1st January and 31st October 2020.

ResultsThe linked cohort includes over 96% of the English population. By combining person-level data across national healthcare settings, data on age, sex and ethnicity are complete for over 95% of the population. Among 53.2M people with no prior diagnosis of stroke/TIA, 98,721 had an incident stroke/TIA, of which 30% were recorded only in primary care and 4% only in death registry records. Among 53.1M people with no prior history of MI, 62,966 had an incident MI, of which 8% were recorded only in primary care and 12% only in death records. A total of 959,067 people had a confirmed or suspected Covid-19 diagnosis (714,162 in primary care data, 126,349 in hospital admission records, 776,503 in Covid-19 laboratory test data and 48,433 participants in death registry records). While 58% of these were recorded in both primary care and Covid-19 laboratory test data, 15% and 18% respectively were recorded in only one.

ConclusionsThis population-wide resource demonstrates the importance of linking person-level data across health settings to maximize completeness of key characteristics and to ascertain cardiovascular events and Covid-19 diagnoses. Although established initially to support research on Covid-19 and cardiovascular disease to benefit clinical care and public health and to inform health care policy, it can broaden further to enable a very wide range of research.","Wood, A.; Denholm,, R.; Hollings, S.; Cooper, J.

24492,Antibody response to first and second dose of BNT162b2 in a cohort of characterized healthcare workers,"BackgroundVaccine-induced population immunity is a key global strategy to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The rapid implementation and availability of several COVID-19 vaccines is now a global health-care priority but more information about humoral responses to single- and double-dose vaccine is needed

Methods163 health care workers (HCW) of the Padua University Hospitals, who underwent a complete vaccination campaign with BNT162b2 vaccine were asked to collect serum samples at 12 (t12) and 28 (t28) days after the first inoculum to allow the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies (Ab) using chemiluminescent assays against the spike (S) protein and the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the virus, respectively.

ResultsSignificant differences were found at t12 for infection-naive and subjects with previous-natural infection who present higher values of specific antibodies, while no significant differences have been found between t12 and t28. No statistically significant difference was found between male and female, while lower Ab levels have been observed in subjects older than 60 years at t12 but not at t28.

ConclusionsOur study confirms observed differences in vaccine responses between infection-naive and subjects with previous natural infection at t12 but not for a longer time. The influence of sex and age deserves further studies, even if the relationship with age seems particularly significant.","Padoan, A.; Dall'olmo, L.; Della Rocca, F.; Barbaro, F.; Cosma, C.; Basso, D.; Cattelan, A.; Cianci, V.; Plebani, M.",2021-03-26,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.03.24.21254240,1,Mario Plebani,University of Padova,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.24.21254240v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.24.21254240v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.cca.2021.04.006
4785,Outcomes of hydroxychloroquine usage in United States veterans hospitalized with Covid-19,"BACKGROUNDDespite limited and conflicting data on the use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with Covid-19, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the emergency use of this drug when clinical trials are unavailable or infeasible. Hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with azithromycin, is being widely used in Covid-19 therapy based on anecdotal and limited observational evidence.

METHODSWe performed a retrospective analysis of data from patients hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in all United States Veterans Health Administration medical centers until April 11, 2020. Patients were categorized based on their exposure to hydroxychloroquine alone (HC) or with azithromycin (HC+AZ) as treatments in addition to standard supportive management for Covid-19. The two primary outcomes were death and the need for mechanical ventilation. We determined the association between treatment and the primary outcomes using competing risk hazard regression adjusting for clinical characteristics via propensity scores. Discharge and death were taken into account as competing risks and subdistribution hazard ratios are presented.

RESULTSA total of 368 patients were evaluated (HC, n=97; HC+AZ, n=113; no HC, n=158). Rates of death in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups were 27.8%, 22.1%, 11.4%, respectively. Rates of ventilation in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups were 13.3%, 6.9%, 14.1%, respectively. Compared to the no HC group, the risk of death from any cause was higher in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.10 to 6.17; P=0.03) but not in the HC+AZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.56 to 2.32; P=0.72). The risk of ventilation was similar in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.53 to 3.79; P=0.48) and in the HC+AZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.16 to 1.12; P=0.09), compared to the no HC group.

CONCLUSIONSIn this study, we found no evidence that use of hydroxychloroquine, either with or without azithromycin, reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with Covid-19. An association of increased overall mortality was identified in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone. These findings highlight the importance of awaiting the results of ongoing prospective, randomized, controlled studies before widespread adoption of these drugs.","Magagnoli, J.; Narendran, S.; Pereira, F.; Cummings, T.; Hardin, J.

8083,"Evaluating the burden of COVID-19 on hospital resources in Bahia, Brazil: A modelling-based analysis of 14.8 million individuals","Here we present a general compartment model with a time-varying transmission rate to describe the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic, parameterized with the demographics of Bahia, a state in northeast Brazil. The dynamics of the model are influenced by the number of asymptomatic cases, hospitalization requirements and mortality due to the disease. A locally-informed model was determined using actual hospitalization records. Together with cases and casualty data, optimized estimates for model parameters were obtained within a metaheuristic framework based on Particle Swarm Optimization. Our strategy is supported by a statistical sensitivity analysis on the model parameters, adequate to properly account for the simulated scenarios. First, we evaluated the effect of previously enforced interventions on the transmission rate. Then, we studied its effects on the number of deaths as well as hospitalization requirements, considering the state as a whole. Special attention is given to the impact of asymptomatic individuals on the dynamic of COVID-19 transmission, as these were estimated to contribute to a 68% increase in the basic reproductive number. Finally, we delineated scenarios that can set guides to protect the health care system, particularly by keeping demand below total bed occupancy. Our results underscore the challenges related to maintaining a fully capable health infrastructure during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, specially in a low-resource setting such as the one focused in this work. The evidences produced by our modelling-based analysis show that decreasing the transmission rate is paramount to success in maintaining health resources availability, but that current local efforts, leading to a 38% decrease in the transmission rate, are still insufficient to prevent its collapse at peak demand. Carefully planned and timely applied interventions, that result in stark decreases in transmission rate, were found to be the most effective in preventing hospital bed shortages for the longest periods.","Oliveira, J.

18595,"Clinical evaluation of the Roche/SD Biosensor rapid antigen test with symptomatic, non-hospitalized patients in a municipal health service drive-through testing site.","BackgroundRapid detection of infectious individuals is essential in stopping the further spread of SARS-CoV-2. Although rapid antigen test is not as sensitive as the gold standard RT-PCR, the time to result is decreased by day(s), strengthening the effectiveness of contact tracing.

MethodsThe Roche/SD Biosensor lateral flow antigen rapid test was evaluated in a mild symptomatic population at a large drive through testing site. A second nasopharyngeal swab was directly tested with the rapid test on site and results were compared to RT-PCR and virus culture. Date of onset and symptoms were analysed using data from a clinical questionnaire.

ResultsWe included 970 persons with complete data. Overall sensitivity and specificity were 84.9% (CI95% 79.1-89.4) and 99.5% (CI95% 98.7-99.8) which translated into a positive predictive value of 97.5% (CI95% 94.0-99.5) under the current regional PCR positivity of 19.2%. Sensitivity for people with high loads of viral RNA (ct <30, 2.17E+05 E gene copy/ml) and who presented within 7 days since symptom onset increased to 95.8% (CI95% 90.5-98.2). Band intensity and time to result correlated strongly with viral load thus strong positive bands could be read before the recommended time. Around 98% of all viable specimen with ct <30 were detected successfully indicating that the large majority of infectious people can be captured with this test.

ConclusionAntigen rapid tests can detect mildly symptomatic cases in the early phase of disease thereby identifying the most infectious individuals. Using this assay can have a significant value in the speed and effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak management.

7030,Nebulized in-line endotracheal dornase alfa and albuterol administered to mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients: A case series,"BackgroundMechanically ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have a mortality of 24-53%, in part due to distal mucopurulent secretions interfering with ventilation. Dornase alfa is recombinant human DNase 1 and digests DNA in mucoid sputum. Nebulized dornase alfa is FDA-approved for cystic fibrosis treatment. DNA from neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contributes to the viscosity of mucopurulent secretions. NETs are found in the serum of patients with severe COVID-19, and targeting NETs reduces mortality in animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, dornase alfa may be beneficial to patients with severe COVID-19--acting as a mucolytic and targeting NETs. However, delivery of nebulized drugs can aerosolize SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, increasing the infection risk for staff. Here, we report a single center case series where dornase alfa was administered through an in-line nebulizer system to minimize risk of virus aerosolization.

MethodsDemographic, clinical data, and outcomes were collected from the electronic medical records of five mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19--including three requiring veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO)--treated with nebulized in-line endotracheal dornase alfa co-administered with albuterol (used to increase delivery to the alveoli), between March 31 and April 24, 2020. Data on tolerability and responses, including longitudinal values capturing respiratory function and inflammatory status, were analyzed.

ResultsFollowing nebulized in-line administration of dornase alfa with albuterol, the fraction of inspired oxygen requirements was reduced for all five patients. All patients remain alive and two patients have been discharged from the intensive care unit. No drug associated toxicities were identified.

ConclusionsThe results presented in this case series suggest that dornase alfa will be well-tolerated by critically ill patients with COVID-19.

23292,Saliva testing is accurate for early-stage and presymptomatic COVID-19,"BackgroundAlthough nasopharyngeal (NP) samples have been considered the gold standard for COVID-19 testing, variability in viral load across different anatomical sites could theoretically cause NP samples to be less sensitive than saliva or nasal samples in certain cases. Self-collected samples also have logistical advantages over NP samples, making them amenable to population-scale screening.

MethodsTo evaluate sampling alternatives for population screening, we collected NP, saliva, and nasal samples from two cohorts with varied levels and types of symptoms.

ResultsIn a mixed cohort of 60 symptomatic and asymptomatic participants, we found that saliva had 88% concordance with NP when tested in the same testing lab (n = 41), and 68% concordance when tested in different testing labs (n = 19). In a second cohort of 20 participants hospitalized for COVID-19, saliva had 74% concordance with NP tested in the same testing lab, but detected virus in two participants that tested negative with NP on the same day. Medical record review showed that the saliva-based testing sensitivity was related to the timing of symptom onset and disease stage.

ConclusionsWe find that no sample site will be perfectly sensitive for COVID-19 testing in all situations, and the significance of negative results will always need to be determined in the context of clinical signs and symptoms. Saliva retained high clinical sensitivity while allowing easier collection, minimizing the exposure of healthcare workers and need for personal protective equipment, and making it a viable option for population-scale testing.","Johnson, A.

5691,Impact of virus testing on COVID-19 case fatality rate: estimate using a fixed-effects model,"BackgroundIn response to the SARS-CoV2 pandemic, governments have adopted a variety of public health measures. There are variations in how much testing has been done across countries. South Korea, Germany, and Iceland take the bet of massive testing of their population. Whereas tests were not performed widely in southern European countries. As the former undergo a lower case-fatality rate due to the COVID-19 than the latter, the impact of the testing strategy must be investigated. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of testing on the case fatality rate.

MethodsWe use data on inpatients across French geographic areas and propose a novel methodology that exploits policy discontinuities at region borders to estimate the effect of COVID-19 tests on the case-fatality rate. In France, testing policies are determined locally. We compare all contiguous department pairs located on the opposite sides of a region border. The heterogeneity in testing rate between department pairs together with the similarities in other dimensions allow us to mimic the existence of treatment and control groups and to identify the impact of testing on mortality.

ResultsThe increase of one percentage point in the test rate is associated with a decrease of 0.001 percentage point in the death rate. In other words, for each additional 1000 tests, one person would have remained alive.

ConclusionMassive population testing could have a significant effect on mortality in different ways. Mass testing may help decision-makers to implement healthcare measures to limit the spread of the disease.","Terriau, A.; Albertini, J.; Poirier, A.; Le Bastard, Q.",2020-05-01,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.26.20080531,1,Quentin Le Bastard,Nantes University Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.20080531v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.20080531v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
10173,"Practical considerations for measuring the effective reproductive number, Rt","Estimation of the effective reproductive number, Rt, is important for detecting changes in disease transmission over time. During the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers and public health officials are using Rt to assess the effectiveness of interventions and to inform policy. However, estimation of Rt from available data presents several challenges, with critical implications for the interpretation of the course of the pandemic. The purpose of this document is to summarize these challenges, illustrate them with examples from synthetic data, and, where possible, make recommendations. For near real-time estimation of Rt, we recommend the approach of Cori et al. (2013), which uses data from before time t and empirical estimates of the distribution of time between infections. Methods that require data from after time t, such as Wallinga and Teunis (2004), are conceptually and methodologically less suited for near real-time estimation, but may be appropriate for retrospective analyses of how individuals infected at different time points contributed to spread. We advise against using methods derived from Bettencourt and Ribeiro (2008), as the resulting Rt estimates may be biased if the underlying structural assumptions are not met. Two key challenges common to all approaches are accurate specification of the generation interval and reconstruction of the time series of new infections from observations occurring long after the moment of transmission. Naive approaches for dealing with observation delays, such as subtracting delays sampled from a distribution, can introduce bias. We provide suggestions for how to mitigate this and other technical challenges and highlight open problems in Rt estimation.

Author summaryThe effective reproductive number, Rt, is a key epidemic parameter used to assess whether an epidemic is growing, shrinking or holding steady. Rt estimates can be used as a near real-time indicator of epidemic growth or to assess the effectiveness of interventions. But due to delays between infection and case observation, estimating Rt in near real-time, and correctly inferring the timing of changes in Rt is challenging. Here, we provide an overview of challenges and best practices for accurate, timely Rt estimation.","Gostic, K.

19297,Mapping each pre-existing conditions association to short-term and long-term COVID-19 complications,"Understanding the relationships between pre-existing conditions and complications of COVID-19 infection is critical to identifying which patients will develop severe disease. Here, we leverage 1.1 million clinical notes from 1,903 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and deep neural network models to characterize associations between 21 pre-existing conditions and the development of 20 complications (e.g. respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, and hematologic) of COVID-19 infection throughout the course of infection (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days, and 61-90 days). Pleural effusion was the most frequent complication of early COVID-19 infection (23% of 383 complications) followed by cardiac arrhythmia (12% of 383 complications). Notably, hypertension was the most significant risk factor associated with 10 different complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac arrhythmia and anemia. Furthermore, novel associations between cancer (risk ratio: 3, p=0.02) or immunosuppression (risk ratio: 4.3, p=0.04) with early-onset heart failure have also been identified. Onset of new complications after 30 days is rare and most commonly involves pleural effusion (31-60 days: 24% of 45 patients, 61-90 days: 25% of 36 patients). Overall, the associations between pre-COVID conditions and COVID-associated complications presented here may form the basis for the development of risk assessment scores to guide clinical care pathways.","Venkatakrishnan, A.; Pawlowski, C.; Zemmour, D.; Hughes, T.; Anand, A.; Berner, G.; Kayal, N.; Puranik, A.; Conrad, I.; Bade, S.; Barve, R.; Sinha, P.; O'horo, J.; Badley, A.

2756,Response and role of palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic: a national telephone survey of hospices in Italy,"BackgroundPalliative care is an important component of healthcare in pandemics, contributing to symptom control, psychological support, and supporting triage and complex decision making.

AimTo examine preparedness for, and impact of, the COVID-19 pandemic on hospices in Italy to inform the response in other countries.

DesignCross-sectional telephone survey, carried out in March 2020.

SettingSixteen Italian hospices, purposively sampled according to COVID-19 risk into high (more than 25 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants), medium (15-25 cases per 100,000), and low risk (fewer than 15 cases per 100,000) regions. A brief questionnaire was developed to guide the interviews. Descriptive analysis was undertaken.

ResultsSeven high risk, five medium risk and four low risk hospices provided data. Two high risk hospices had experienced COVID-19 cases among both patients and staff. All hospices had implemented policy changes, and several had rapidly implemented changes in practice including transfer of staff from inpatient to community settings, change in admission criteria, and daily telephone support for families. Concerns included scarcity of personal protective equipment, a lack of hospice-specific guidance on COVID-19, anxiety about needing to care for children and other relatives, and poor integration of palliative care in the acute setting.

ConclusionThe hospice sector is capable of responding flexibly and rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments must urgently recognise the essential contribution of hospice and palliative care to the COVID-19 pandemic, and ensure these services are integrated into the health care system response. Availability of personal protective equipment and setting-specific guidance is essential.

16705,"Less severe course of COVID-19 is associated with elevated levels of antibodies against seasonal human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 (HCoV OC43, HCoV HKU1)","The clinical course of COVID-19 is very heterogeneous: Most infected individuals can be managed in an outpatient setting, but a substantial proportion of patients requires intensive care, resulting in a high rate of fatalities. Recently, an association between contact to small children and mild course of COVID-19 was reported. We performed an observational study to assess the impact of previous infections with seasonal coronaviruses on COVID-19 severity. 60 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections were included (age 30 - 82 years; 52 males, 8 females): 19 inpatients with critical disease, 16 inpatients with severe or moderate disease and 25 outpatients (age and gender matched to inpatients). Patients with critical disease had significantly lower levels of HCoV OC43- (p=0.016) and HCoV HKU1-specific (p=0.023) antibodies at the first encounter compared to other COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that previous infections with seasonal coronaviruses might protect against a severe course of disease. This finding should be validated in other settings and could contribute to identify persons at risk before an infection.","Dugas, M.; Grote-Westrick, T.; Vollenberg, R.; Lorentzen, E.; Brix, T.; Schmidt, H.; Tepasse, P.-R.; Kuehn, J.",2020-10-14,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.12.20211599,1,Martin Dugas,University of Muenster,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.12.20211599v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.12.20211599v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1016/j.ijid.2021.02.085
25522,CovidEnvelope: A Fast Automated Approach to Diagnose COVID-19 from Cough Signals,"The COVID-19 pandemic has a devastating impact on the health and well-being of global population. Cough audio signals classification showed potential as a screening approach for diagnosing people, infected with COVID-19. Recent approaches need costly deep learning algorithms or sophisticated methods to extract informative features from cough audio signals. In this paper, we propose a low-cost envelope approach, called CovidEnvelope, which can classify COVID-19 positive and negative cases from raw data by avoiding above disadvantages. This automated approach can pre-process cough audio signals by filter-out back-ground noises, generate an envelope around the audio signal, and finally provide outcomes by computing area enclosed by the envelope. It has been seen that reliable datasets are also important for achieving high performance. Our approach proves that human verbal confirmation is not a reliable source of information. Finally, the approach reaches highest sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC of 0.92, 0.87, 0.89, and 0.89 respectively. The automatic approach only takes 1.8 to 3.9 minutes to compute these performances. Overall, this approach is fast and sensitive to diagnose the people living with COVID-19, regardless of having COVID-19 related symptoms or not, and thus have vast applicability in human well-being by designing HCI devices incorporating this approach.","Hossain, M.

10196,COVID-19 Outpatient Screening: a Prediction Score for Adverse Events,"BackgroundWe sought to develop an automatable score to predict hospitalization, critical illness, or death in patients at risk for COVID-19 presenting for urgent care during the Massachusetts outbreak.

MethodsSingle-center study of adult outpatients seen in respiratory illness clinics (RICs) or the emergency department (ED), including development (n = 9381, March 7-May 2) and prospective (n = 2205, May 3-14) cohorts. Data was queried from Partners Enterprise Data Warehouse. Outcomes were hospitalization, critical illness or death within 7 days. We developed the COVID-19 Acuity Score (CoVA) using automatically extracted data from the electronic medical record and learning-to-rank ordinal logistic regression modeling. Calibration was assessed using predicted-to-observed ratio (E/O). Discrimination was assessed by C-statistics (AUC).

ResultsIn the development cohort, 27.3%, 7.2%, and 1.1% of patients experienced hospitalization, critical illness, or death, respectively; and in the prospective cohort, 26.1%, 6.3%, and 0.5%. CoVA showed excellent performance in the development cohort (concurrent validation) for hospitalization (E/O: 1.00, AUC: 0.80); for critical illness (E/O: 1.00, AUC: 0.82); and for death (E/O: 1.00, AUC: 0.87). Performance in the prospective cohort (prospective validation) was similar for hospitalization (E/O: 1.01, AUC: 0.76); for critical illness (E/O 1.03, AUC: 0.79); and for death (E/O: 1.63, AUC=0.93). Among 30 predictors, the top five were age, diastolic blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation, COVID-19 testing status, and respiratory rate.

21158,Sleeping under the waves: a longitudinal study across the contagion peaks of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy,"After the March-April 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, a second contagion wave afflicted Europe in autumn. This study aimed to evaluate sleep health/patterns of Italians during this further challenging situation.

A total of 2013 Italians longitudinally participated in a web-based survey during the two contagion peaks of the COVID-19 outbreak. We investigated the risk factors for sleep disturbances during the second wave, and we compared sleep quality and psychological well-being between the two assessments (March-April and November-December 2020). Female gender, low education, evening chronotype, being at high-risk for COVID-19 infection, reporting negative social or economic impact, and evening smartphone overuse predicted a higher risk of poor sleep and insomnia symptoms during the second wave. Advanced age, living with high-risk subjects for COVID-19 infection, and having a relative/friend infected with COVID-19 before the prior two weeks were risk categories for poor sleep quality. Living with children, having contracted COVID-19 before the prior two weeks, being pessimistic on the vaccine, and working in healthcare were risk factors for insomnia symptoms. The follow-up assessment highlighted reduced insomnia symptoms and anxiety. Nevertheless, we showed reduced sleep duration, higher daytime dysfunction and sleep medication use, and advanced sleep phase, confirming the alarming prevalence of poor sleepers ([~]60%) and severe depression ([~]20%) in a context of increased perceived stress.

This study demonstrated a persistent impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep and mental health.

5599,Pneumask: Modified Full-Face Snorkel Masks as Reusable Personal Protective Equipment for Hospital Personnel,"Here we adapt and evaluate a full-face snorkel mask for use as personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers, who lack appropriate alternatives during the COVID-19 crisis in the spring of 2020. The design (referred to as Pneumask) consists of a custom snorkel-specific adapter that couples the snorkel-port of the mask to a rated filter (either a medical-grade ventilator inline filter or an industrial filter). This design has been tested for the sealing capability of the mask, filter performance, CO2 buildup and clinical usability. These tests found the Pneumask capable of forming a seal that exceeds the standards required for half-face respirators or N95 respirators. Filter testing indicates a range of options with varying performance depending on the quality of filter selected, but with typical filter performance exceeding or comparable to the N95 standard. CO2 buildup was found to be roughly equivalent to levels found in half-face elastomeric respirators in literature. Clinical usability tests indicate sufficient visibility and, while speaking is somewhat muffled, this can be addressed via amplification (Bluetooth voice relay to cell phone speakers through an app) in noisy environments. We present guidance on the assembly, usage (donning and doffing) and decontamination protocols. The benefit of the Pneumask as PPE is that it is reusable for longer periods than typical disposable N95 respirators, as the snorkel mask can withstand rigorous decontamination protocols (that are standard to regular elastomeric respirators). With the dire worldwide shortage of PPE for medical personnel, our conclusions on the performance and efficacy of Pneumask as an N95-alternative technology are cautiously optimistic.

Key pointsFull-face snorkel masks are adapted for use as Personal Protective Equipment during the COVID-19 crisis, using a custom adapter that facilitates the attachment of inline medical-grade respiratory filters or NIOSH industrial respirator filters. This solution was designed as a reusable stopgap solution for healthcare workers to help address the short-term global N95 respirator shortage.","Kroo, L.; Kothari, A.; Hannebelle, M.; Herring, G.; Pollina, T.; Chang Md, R.; Banavar, S.

11870,Effect of corticosteroid treatment on 1376 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A cohort study.,"BackgroundSince the start of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, corticosteroid use has been the subject of debate. The available evidence is uncertain, and knowledge on the subject is evolving. The aim of our cohort study was to evaluate the association between corticosteroid therapy and hospital mortality, in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 after balancing for possible confounders.

ResultsOne thousand four hundred forty four patients were admitted to our hospital with a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, 559 patients (39%) were exposed to corticosteroids during hospital stay, 844 (61%) were not exposed to corticosteroids.In the cohort of patients exposed to corticosteroids, 171 (30.6%) died. In the cohort of patients not exposed to corticosteroids, 183 (21.7%) died (unadjusted p <0.001). Nonetheless, exposure to corticosteroids was not associated with in-hospital mortality after balancing with overlap weight propensity score (adjusted p = 0.25). Patients in the corticosteroids cohort had reduced risk of ICU admission (adjusted p <0.001).

ConclusionsTreatment with corticosteroids did not affect hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 after balancing for confounders. A possible advantage of corticosteroid therapy was to reduce Intensive Care Unit admission, which could be useful in reducing pressure on the Intensive Care Units in times of limited resources, as during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Albani, F.; Fusina, F.; Granato, E.; Capotosto, C.; Ceracchi, C.; Gargaruti, R.; Santangelo, G.; Schiavone, L.; Taranto, M.

4773,Estimating COVID-19 outbreak risk through air travel,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly across the globe during the first several months of 2020, resulting in a pandemic. Substantial, non-discriminatory limitations have been imposed on air travel to inhibit further spread of the virus. However, as disease prevalence and incidence decreases, more specific control measures will be sought so that commercial air travel can operate yet not impose a high threat of COVID-19 resurgence. We considered the risk posed by different locations to initiate a resurgence of COVID-19 at such times.

MethodsWe use modelled global air travel data for October (just before a second wave of COVID-19 might be expected) and population density to analyse the risk posed by 1364 airports to initiate a COVID-19 outbreak. We use a probabilistic, branching-process based approach that considers the volume of air travelers between airports and the R0 of each location, scaled by population density. This exercise is performed globally as well as specifically for two potentially vulnerable locations: Africa and India.

ResultsWe show that globally, many of the airports posing the highest risk are in China and India. An outbreak of COVID-19 in Africa is most likely to originate in a passenger travelling from Europe. On the other hand, the highest risk to India is from domestic travellers. Our results are robust to changes in the underlying epidemiological assumptions.

ConclusionsVariation in flight volumes and destinations creates a non-uniform distribution of the risk different airports pose to resurgence of a COVID-19 outbreak. We suggest the method presented here as a tool for the estimation of this risk. Our method can be used to inform efficient allocation of resources, such as tests identifying infected passengers, so that they could be differentially deployed in various locations.","Daon, Y.; Thompson, R.

6265,A mathematical model to investigate the transmission of COVID-19 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"Since the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19) in the 2nd day of March, Saudi Arabia has not report a quite rapid COVD-19 spread compared to America and many European countries. Possible causes include the spread of asymptomatic cases. To characterize the transmission of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, this paper applies a susceptible, exposed, symptomatic, asymptomatic, hospitalized, and recovered dynamical model, along with the official COVID-19 reported data by the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia.

18336,Modeling the Effect of Lockdown Timing as a COVID-19 Control Measure in Countries with Differing Social Contacts,"The application, timing, and duration of lockdown strategies during a pandemic remain poorly quantified with regards to expected public health outcomes. Previous projection models have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRD-V), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R0, for that model. Applying the R0 formula as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the distribution and four categories of possible R0 for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly, we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a """"tunneling"""" effect on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital capacity.","Oraby, T.; Tyshenko, M.

We conducted this retrospective cohort study to identify the risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality outcomes with a cohort of 1016 COVID-19 patients diagnosed in May 2020. Data were collected by telephone-interview and reviewing records using a questionnaire and checklist. Morbidity (64.4% Vs. 6.0%) and mortality (2.3% Vs. 2.5%) outcomes varied between the 14th and 28th day. Morbidity risk factors included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (RR=1.19, RR=2.68) both on the 14th and 18th day while elderly (AOR=2.56) and smokeless tobacco (SLT) (AOR=2.17) on the 28th day. Mortality risk factors included elderly (AOR=10.14), COPD (RR=5.93), and SLT (AOR=2.25) on the 14th day, and elderly (AOR=24.37) and COPD (RR=2.72) on the 28th day. The morbidity risk was higher with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (RR=3.33) and chronic liver disease (CLD) (RR=3.99) on the 28th day.

In this study, we investigated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in 797 asymptomatic healthcare workers with intensive exposure to COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China. Positive IgG was detected from 35 asymptomatic healthcare workers, and the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic healthcare workers was 4.39% (35/797).

When contacting with the patients, 15 of them dressed with full personal protective equipment (PPE), and 16 worn N95 mask and gown. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation reported that the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 4.39% in asymptomatic healthcare workers with applied PPE in a high epidemic area, which may provide useful information of estimating asymptomatic infection rate in general population.","Xiong, S.; Guo, C.; Dittmer, U.; Zheng, X.; Wang, B.",2020-06-02,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.28.20110767,1,Baoju Wang,"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College , HUST",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.20110767v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.20110767v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
21569,Near real-time surveillance of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic with incomplete data,"Designing public health responses to outbreaks requires close monitoring of population-level health indicators in real-time. Thus, an accurate estimation of the epidemic curve is critical. We propose an approach to reconstruct epidemic curves in near real time. We apply this approach to characterize the early SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in two Spanish regions between March and April 2020.

We address two data collection problems that affected the reliability of the available real-time epidemiological data, namely, the frequent missing information documenting when a patient first experienced symptoms, and the frequent retrospective revision of historical information (including right censoring). This is done by using a novel back-calculating procedure based on imputing patients dates of symptom onset from reported cases, according to a dynamically-estimated """"backward"""" reporting delay conditional distribution, and adjusting for right censoring using an existing package, NobBS, to estimate in real time (nowcast) cases by date of symptom onset. This process allows us to obtain an approximation of the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) in real-time.

At each step, we evaluate how different assumptions affect the recovered epidemiological events and compare the proposed approach to the alternative procedure of merely using curves of case counts, by report day, to characterize the time-evolution of the outbreak. Finally, we assess how these real-time estimates compare with subsequently documented epidemiological information that is considered more reliable and complete that became available later in time. Our approach may help improve accuracy, quantify uncertainty, and evaluate frequently unstated assumptions when recovering the epidemic curves from limited data obtained from public health surveillance systems in other locations.","Martinez De Salazar, P.; Lu, F.; Hay, J.

4331,COVID-19 outbreak at a large homeless shelter in Boston: Implications for universal testing,"The circumstances of homelessness create the potential for rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in this vulnerable population. Upon observing a cluster of COVID-19 cases from a single large homeless shelter in Boston, Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program conducted symptom assessments and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 among all guests residing at the shelter over a 2-day period. Of 408 participants, 147 (36.0%) were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. COVID-positive individuals were more likely to be male (p<0.001) but did not differ significantly from COVID-negative individuals with respect to other demographic and clinical characteristics. Cough (7.5%), shortness of breath (1.4%), and fever (0.7%) were all uncommon among COVID-positive individuals. Our findings illustrate the rapidity with which COVID-19 can be widely transmitted in a homeless shelter setting and suggest that universal PCR testing, rather than a symptom triggered approach, may be a better strategy for identifying and mitigating COVID-19 among people experiencing homelessness.","Baggett, T.

27987,Factors affecting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in school settings,"BackgroundSeveral studies have reported SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in schools, with a wide range of secondary attack rate (SAR; range: 0-100%). We aimed to examine the key risk factors to better understand transmission in school settings.

MethodsWe collected records of SARS-CoV-2 school outbreaks globally published from January 2020 to January 2021 and compiled information on hypothesized risk factors. We utilized the directed acyclic graph (DAG) to conceptualize the risk mechanisms, used logistic regression to examine each risk-factor group, and further built multiple variable models based on the marginal analysis. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.

ResultsFrom 17 relevant articles, 26 school clusters were included for analysis. The best-fit model showed that the intensity of community transmission (aOR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.22 - 1.30, for each increase of 10 cases per 100,000 persons per week), social distancing (aOR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.18 - 0.37), mask-wearing (aOR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.35 - 0.78) were associated the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in schools. Compared to students in pre-schools, the aOR was 0.12 (95% CI: 0.07 - 0.19) for students in primary schools and 1.31 (95% CI: 0.93 - 1.87) for students in high schools.

ConclusionsPreventive measures in both schools (e.g. social distancing and mask-wearing) and communities (additionally, vaccination) should be taken to collectively reduce transmission and protect children in schools. Flexible reopening policies may be considered for different levels of schools given their risk differences.

17700,MODELLING PRESYMPTOMATIC INFECTIOUSNESS IN COVID-19,"This paper considers SEPIR, the extension of an existing parametric SEIR continuous simulation compartment model. Both models can be fitted to real data as they include parameters that can simply be estimated from the data. However SEPIR deploys an additional presymptomatic (also called asymptomatic) infectious stage that is not included in SEIR but which is known to exist in COVID-19. This stage is also parametrised and so can be fitted to data. Both SEPIR and the existing SEIR model assume a homogeneous mixing population, an idealisation that is unrealistic in practice when dynamically varying control strategies are deployed against virus. This means that if either model is to represent more than just a single period in the behaviour of the epidemic, then the parameters of the model will have to be time dependent.

12817,Risk stratification as a tool to rationalize quarantine among health care workers exposed to COVID-19 cases - Evidence from a tertiary healthcare centre in India,"BackgroundQuarantine of healthcare workers (HCWs) exposed to COVID -19 confirmed cases is a well-known strategy for limiting the transmission of infection. However, there is need of evidence-based guidelines for quarantine of HCWs in COVID -19.

MethodsWe describe our experience of contact tracing and risk stratification of 3853 HCWs who were exposed to confirmed COVID-19 cases in a tertiary health care institution in India. We developed an algorithm, on the basis of risk stratification, to rationalize quarantine among HCWs. Risk stratification was based on the duration of exposure, distance from the patient, and appropriateness of personal protection equipment (PPE) usage. Only high-risk contacts were quarantined for 14 days. They underwent testing for COVID-19 after five days of exposure, while low-risk contacts continued their work with adherence to physical distancing, hand hygiene, and appropriate use of PPE. The low-risk contacts were encouraged to monitor for symptoms and report for COVID-19 screening if fever, cough, or shortness of breath occurred. We followed up all contacts for 14 days from the last exposure and observed for symptoms of COVID-19 and test positivity.

Results and interpretationOut of total 3853 contacts, 560 (14.5%) were categorized as high-risk contacts, and 40 of them were detected positive for COVID-19, with a test positivity rate of 7.1% (95% CI = 5.2 - 9.6). Overall, 118 (3.1%) of all contacts tested positive. Our strategy prevented 3215 HCWs from being quarantined and saved 45,010 person-days of health workforce until June 8, 2020, in the institution.

We conclude that exposure-based risk stratification and quarantine of HCWs is a viable strategy to prevent unnecessary quarantine, in a healthcare institution.

SummaryO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about this subject?C_ST_ABSO_LIQuarantine of HCWs is a well-known strategy for community and HCWs to prevent the transmission of COVID-19.
C_LIO_LIThough success stories of prompt contact tracing and quarantine to control COVID-19 are available from countries like South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong, there is a scarcity of evidence that could guide targeted quarantine of HCWs exposed to COVID -19 in India.
C_LI

What does this study add?O_LIOnly 14.5% HCWs exposed to COVID-19 cases were stratified """"high risk"""" contacts, and the most common reason for high-risk contacts was non-formal workplace interactions such as having meals together.
C_LIO_LIThe overall test positivity rate among the high-risk contacts was 7.1%, while it was higher in symptomatic high-risk contacts as compared to those who were asymptomatic (10.2% vs. 6.3%).

Here, we have designed and developed toehold RNA-based sensors for direct and ultrasensitive SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. In our assay, isothermal amplification of a fragment of SARS-CoV-2 RNA coupled with activation of our biosensors leads to a conformational switch in the sensor. This leads to translation of a reporter-protein e.g. LacZ or Nano-lantern that is easily detected using color/luminescence. This response can be visualized by the human eye, or a simple cell phone camera as well as quantified using a spectrophotometer/luminometer. By optimizing RNA-amplification and biosensor-design, we have generated a highly-sensitive diagnostic assay; with sensitivity down to attomolar (100 copies of) SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Finally, this PHAsed NASBA-Translation Optical Method (PHANTOM) efficiently detects the presence of viral RNA in human patient samples, with clear distinction from samples designated negative for the virus. The biosensor response correlates well with Ct values from RT-qPCR tests and thus presents a powerful and easily accessible strategy for detecting Covid infection.","Chakravarthy, A.; N, A.

21512,Identification of COVID-19 Subtypes Based on Immunogenomic Profiling,"Although previous studies have shown that the host immune response is crucial in determining clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, the association between host immune signatures and COVID-19 patient outcomes remains unclear. Based on the enrichment levels of 11 immune signatures (eight immune-inciting and three immune-inhibiting signatures) in leukocytes of 100 COVID-19 patients, we identified three COVID-19 subtypes: Im-C1, Im-C2, and Im-C3, by clustering analysis. Im-C1 had the lowest immune-inciting signatures and high immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C2 had medium immune-inciting signatures and high immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C3 had the highest immune-inciting signatures while the lowest immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C3 and Im-C1 displayed the best and worst clinical outcomes, respectively, suggesting that antiviral immune responses alleviated the severity of COVID-19 patients. We further demonstrated that the adaptive immune response had a stronger impact on COVID-19 outcomes than the innate immune response. The patients in Im-C3 were younger than those in Im-C1, indicating that younger persons have stronger antiviral immune responses than older persons. Nevertheless, we did not observe a significant association between sex and immune responses in COVID-19 patients. In addition, we found that the type II IFN response signature was an adverse prognostic factor for COVID-19. Our identification of COVID-19 immune subtypes has potential clinical implications for the management of COVID-19 patients.","Feng, Q.; Wang, X.",2021-01-26,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.01.24.21250387,1,Xiaosheng Wang,China Pharmaceutical University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.24.21250387v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.24.21250387v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.intimp.2021.107615
8295,Differentiating COVID-19 from other types of pneumonia with convolutional neural networks,"INTRODUCTIONA widely-used method for diagnosing COVID-19 is the nucleic acid test based on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, the sensitivity of real time RT-PCR tests is low and it can take up to 8 hours to receive the test results. Radiologic methods can provide higher sensitivity. The aim of this study is to investigate the use of X-ray and convolutional neural networks for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and to differentiate it from viral and/or bacterial pneumonia, as 2-class (bacterial pneumonia vs COVID-19 and viral pneumonia vs COVID-19) and 3- class (bacterial pneumonia, COVID-19, and healthy group (BCH), and among viral pneumonia, COVID- 19, and healthy group (VCH)) experiments.

METHODS225 COVID-19, 1,583 healthy control, 2,780 bacterial pneumonia, and 1,493 viral pneumonia chest X-ray images were used. 2-class- and 3-class-experiments were performed with different convolutional neural network (ConvNet) architectures, with different variations of convolutional layers and fully-connected layers.

Patients with COVID-19 exhibited considerable variation in disease behavior. Pervious genome-wide association studies have identified potential genetic variants involved in the risk and prognosis of COVID-19, but the underlying biological interpretation remains largely unclear.

MethodsWe applied the summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) method to identify genes that were pleiotropically associated with the risk and various outcomes of COVID-19, including severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19 and hospitalized COVID-19.

ResultsIn blood, we identified 2 probes, ILMN_1765146 and ILMN_1791057 tagging IFNAR2, that showed pleiotropic association with hospitalized COVID-19 ({beta} [SE] = 0.42 [0.09], P = 4.75x10-06 and {beta} [SE] = -0.48 [0.11], P = 6.76x10-06, respectively). Although no other probes were significant after correction for multiple testing in both blood and lung, multiple genes as tagged by the top 5 probes were involved in inflammation or antiviral immunity, and several other tagged genes, such as PON2 and HPS5, were involved in blood coagulation.

ConclusionsWe identified IFNAR2 and other potential genes that could be involved in the susceptibility or prognosis of COVID-19. These findings provide important leads to a better understanding of the mechanisms of cytokine storm and venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 and potential therapeutic targets for the effective treatment of COVID-19.","Liu, D.; Yang, J.; Feng, B.; Lu, W.; Zhao, C.; Li, L.",2020-09-04,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.09.02.20187179,2,Lizhuo Li,Capital Medical University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.20187179v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.20187179v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.11.031
26035,Transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital setting,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 can spread efficiently in hospitals, but the transmission pathways amongst patients and healthcare workers are unclear.

MethodsWe analysed data from four teaching hospitals in Oxfordshire, UK, from January to October 2020. Associations between infectious SARS-CoV-2 individuals and infection risk were quantified using logistic, generalised additive and linear mixed models. Cases were classified as community- or hospital-acquired using likely incubation periods.

ResultsNine-hundred and twenty of 66184 patients who were hospitalised during the study period had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test within the same period (1%). Out of these, 571 patients had their first positive PCR tests while hospitalised (62%), and 97 of these occurred at least seven days after admission (11%). Amongst the 5596 healthcare workers, 615 (11%) tested positive during the study period using PCR or serological tests. For susceptible patients, one day in the same ward with another patient with hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 was associated with an additional eight infections per 1000 susceptible patients (95%CrI 6-10). Exposure to an infectious patient with community-acquired COVID-19 or to an infectious healthcare worker was associated with substantially lower infection risks (2/1000 susceptible patients/day, 95%CrI 1-2). As for healthcare worker infections, exposure to an infectious patient with hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 or to an infectious healthcare worker were both associated with an additional one infection per 1000 susceptible healthcare workers per day (95%CrI 1-2). Exposure to an infectious patient with community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 was associated with half this risk (0.5/1000 susceptible healthcare workers/day, 95%CrI 0.3-0.7).

InterpretationExposure to patients with hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 poses a substantial infection risk. Infection control measures to limit nosocomial transmission must be optimised to protect both staff and patients from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched the PubMed database using the search terms (""""COVID-19"""" OR """"SARS-CoV-2"""") AND (""""nosocomial"""" OR """"hospital"""") AND (""""transmission"""") in either the abstracts or titles, for English-language articles published up to March 31, 2021. This returned 748 results, out of which ten reported transmission events in the hospital setting quantitatively. These publications can be broadly categorised to epidemiological descriptions of isolated outbreaks (5) or contact tracing of patients exposed to infected healthcare workers (1), retrospective cohort studies involving a particular group of patients, e.g., patients who underwent surgical procedures (2), and using genomic sequencing to identify transmission clusters (2). None of the studies reported the comparative transmission rates of SARS-CoV-2 amongst patients and staff.

Added value of this studyThis study reports the analysis of a large observational dataset collected from a group of hospitals in the UK over eight months, consisting of both hospitalised patients and healthcare workers. Based on these detailed individual-level data, we quantified the associations between patient and healthcare worker characteristics and risks for acquiring nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection after adjusting for their exposures to SARS-CoV-2. Over the study period, we describe how risk of acquisition changes both with calendar time and over a patients hospital stay. By linking the presence of infected and susceptible patients and healthcare workers by time and ward locations, we quantify the relative importance of the transmission pathways for both the susceptible patients and healthcare workers.

Implications of all the available evidenceNosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is common. Identifying the drivers of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions in the hospital setting is essential for designing infection prevention and control policies to minimise the added pressure from such events on our health systems. We found that newly infected patients who acquired SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital pose the highest risk of onward transmission to other patients and healthcare workers. Infection control and prevention efforts need to be enhanced around these patients to prevent further transmissions and studies assessing the effectiveness of these policies are needed.","Mo, Y.; Eyre, D.

21656,Covid-19 positive test cycle threshold trends predict covid-19 mortality in Rhode Island,"The cycle thresholds (Cts) at which reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) tests for covid-19 become positive are intimately associated with both viral load, and covid-19 infectiousness (i.e., ability to culture live virus). Clinical data indicate lower Cts--and hence larger viral loads--independently predict greater covid-19 mortality when patients are hospitalized for symptomatic covid-19 pneumonia. We merged public covid-19 mortality data from the Rhode Island Department of Health with a de-identified dataset of n=5036 positive rtPCR test Cts from the Rhode Island Department of Health State Laboratory to explore the potential relationship between positive covid-19 test Ct distribution trends, and covid-19 mortality in the state of Rhode Island, from March through early to mid-June, 2020. Mean daily covid-19 positive test Ct data were compiled, and 7-day rolling average covid-19 mortality was offset by 21-days, given the lag between infection and death. We divided the Ct data into three strata, >32, 28-32, and <28, which were operationally defined as """"not infectious,"""" """"maybe infectious,"""" and """"infectious,"""" respectively. Between late March and June, mean daily Ct values rose linearly (R-squared=0.789) so that by early June, as the covid-19 pandemic ebbed in severity, all means reached the noninfectious (Ct >32) range. Most notably, this May-June trend for Cts was accompanied by a marked, steady decline in Rhode Islands daily covid-19 mortality. Our results suggest that monitoring, and public reporting of mean population covid-19 test Cts over time is warranted to gauge the vacillations of covid-19 outbreak severity, including covid-19 mortality trends.","Bostom, A.; Eaton, C.

17412,CO2 measurements in instrumental and vocal closed room settings as a risk reducing measure for a Coronavirus infection,"Contaminated aerosols in room air are one of the transmission routes of the coronavirus. The amount of contaminated aerosols in the room seems to play an important role for the infection risk. In rooms without technical air refreshing systems, the aerosol concentration can be reduced with simple natural ventilation activity. Instrumental and vocal lessons and rehearsals take place in closed indoor rooms. Therefore it is important to optimize the necessary ventilation activity in order to keep the infection risk for musicians low. Therefore, knowledge about the maximum duration of the lesson or rehearsal for ventilation intervals are necessary. In this study, carbon dioxide concentration (CO2) as an indicator of the indoor air quality (IAQ) was measured during 47 music lessons and rehearsals at a university of music including 141 persons. From these measurements, the air exchange rates of the rooms and the CO2 emission rates per person were extracted. The results show that the CO2 emission in musical activities can be assigned to light and moderate activities between 28 l/h and 39 l/h. Wind instruments had the highest CO2 emissions. Singers showed low CO2 emission rates comparable to the control group which only spoke and listened. Recommendations for the frequency of ventilation breaks were derived from empirical data and allow for an individual risk assessment of instrumental and vocal lessons and rehearsals depending on room size and number of musicians.","Nusseck, M.; Richter, B.; Holtmeier, L.; Skala, D.; Spahn, C.",2020-10-27,Occupational And Environmental Health,10.1101/2020.10.26.20218354,1,Manfred Nusseck,Freiburg Institute for Musicians Medicine,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.26.20218354v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.26.20218354v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
19121,"Smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 positivity, while Never-smoking reduces the risk","IntroductionDoes smoking decrease the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 because the never-smokers (84%) prevalence is high and the current-smokers prevalence is low among COVID-19 positive patients? 1,2,3,4,5,6 We sought to determine whether never smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 positivity among the 50 to 69-year old patients because they are more likely to test positive for COVID-19.7

MethodWe conducted a retrospective chart review of COVID-19 Polymerase chain reaction, in-hospital tested [&ge;]18-year-old patients. A Poisson regression analysis stratified into never-smokers and history of smoking (current + former smokers) was conducted.

Results277 COVID-19 negative and 117 COVID-19 positive patients charts with a never-smokers prevalence of 42.32% and 54% respectively were analyzed. The never-smokers prevalence was 54%, 20-39-years; 61 %, 40 -49-years; 41%, 50 - 69-years; and 43%, 70 - 100-years.

The 40-49-year-old current and former smokers were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 [1.309 (1.047 - 1.635)], unlike the 40-49-year-old never-smokers [0.976 (0.890-1.071)] who had a lower risk.

Regardless of their smoking status, males [1.084(1.021 - 1.151)] and the 50-69-year-old patients [1.082 (1.014 -1.154)] were more likely to test positive for COVID-19, while end stage renal disease [0.908(0.843-0.978)] and non-COVID-19 respiratory viral illness [0.907 (0.863 - 0.953)] patients had a lower risk of COVID-19 positivity.

Heart failure [0.907 (0.830 - 0.991)], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [0.842 (0.745 - 0.952)] and Parkinsons disease [0.823 (0.708 - 0.957)] never-smokers were less likely to test positive for COVID-19.

ConclusionThis is the first study to show that smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 positivity among the 40-49-year-old patients, while not smoking reduces the risk of COVID-19 positivity among the heart failure, COPD and Parkinsons disease patients. This study emphasizes that COVID-19 positivity risk is not reduced by smoking and not increased by not smoking.","Barasa, S.; Kiage-Mokaya, J.; Friedlander, M.; Cruz-Madrid, K.",2020-12-02,Respiratory Medicine,10.1101/2020.11.30.20241380,1,Samson Barasa,PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Center,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.30.20241380v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.30.20241380v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,"NA"
19887,cAMP prevents antibody-mediated thrombus formation in COVID-19,"Thromboembolic events are frequently reported in patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, the exact mechanisms of thromboembolic events remain elusive. In this work, we show that immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass in patients with COVID-19 trigger the formation of procoagulant PLTs in a Fc-gamma-RIIA (Fc{gamma}RIIA) dependent pathway leading to increased thrombus formation in vitro. Most importantly, these events were significantly inhibited via Fc{gamma}RIIA blockade as well as by the elevation of PLTs intracellular cyclic-adenosine-monophosphate (cAMP) levels by the clinical used agent Iloprost. The novel findings of Fc{gamma}RIIA mediated prothrombotic conditions in terms of procoagulant PLTs leading to higher thrombus formation as well as the successful inhibition of these events via Iloprost could be promising for the future treatment of the complex coagulopathy observed in COVID-19 disease.

16837,"A Sensitive, Rapid, and Portable CasRx-based Diagnostic Assay for SARS-CoV2","Since its first emergence from China in late 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread globally despite unprecedented containment efforts, resulting in a catastrophic worldwide pandemic. Successful identification and isolation of infected individuals can drastically curtail virus spread and limit outbreaks. However, during the early stages of global transmission, point-of-care diagnostics were largely unavailable and continue to remain difficult to procure, greatly inhibiting public health efforts to mitigate spread. Furthermore, the most prevalent testing kits rely on reagent- and time-intensive protocols to detect viral RNA, preventing rapid and cost-effective diagnosis. Therefore the development of an extensive toolkit for point-of-care diagnostics that is expeditiously adaptable to new emerging pathogens is of critical public health importance. Recently, a number of novel CRISPR-based diagnostics have been developed to detect COVID-19. Herein, we outline the development of a CRISPR-based nucleic acid molecular diagnostic utilizing a Cas13d ribonuclease derived from Ruminococcus flavefaciens (CasRx) to detect SARS-CoV-2, an approach we term SENSR (Sensitive Enzymatic Nucleic-acid Sequence Reporter). We demonstrate SENSR robustly detects SARS-CoV-2 sequences in both synthetic and patient-derived samples by lateral flow and fluorescence, thus expanding the available point-of-care diagnostics to combat current and future pandemics.","Brogan, D.

We detected ACE2 protein expression within the cilia organelle of ciliated airway epithelial cells, which likely represents the initial or early subcellular site of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry during respiratory transmission. We further determined whether ACE2 expression in the cilia of upper respiratory cells was influenced by patient demographics, clinical characteristics, co-morbidities, or medication use, and found no evidence that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) increases ACE2 protein expression.","Lee, I.

4042,Making sense of the Global Coronavirus Data: The role of testing rates in understanding the pandemic and our exit strategy,"The Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) outbreak has caused havoc across the world. Subsequently, research on COVID-19 has focused on number of cases and deaths and predicted projections have focused on these parameters. We propose that the number of tests performed is a very important denominator in understanding the COVID-19 data. We analysed the number of diagnostic tests performed in proportion to the number of cases and subsequently deaths across different countries and projected pandemic outcomes.

We obtained real time COVID-19 data from the reference website Worldometer at 0900 BST on Saturday 4th April, 2020 and collated the information obtained on the top 50 countries with the highest number of COVID 19 cases. We analysed this data according to the number of tests performed as the main denominator. Country wise population level pandemic projections were extrapolated utilising three models - 1) inherent case per test and death per test rates at the time of obtaining the data (4/4/2020 0900 BST) for each country; 2) rates adjusted according to the countries who conducted at least 100000 tests and 3) rates adjusted according to South Korea.

We showed that testing rates impact on the number of cases and deaths and ultimately on future projections for the pandemic across different countries. We found that countries with the highest testing rates per population have the lowest death rates and give us an early indication of an eventual COVID-19 mortality rate. It is only by continued testing on a large scale that will enable us to know if the increasing number of patients who are seriously unwell in hospitals across the world are the tip of the iceberg or not. Accordingly, obtaining this information through a rapid increase in testing globally is the only way which will enable us to exit the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce economic and social instability.","Potluri, R.; Lavu, D.",2020-04-11,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.06.20054239,1,Rahul Potluri,ACALM Big Data Research Group,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20054239v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20054239v1.full.pdf,cc_by,"NA"

To further enhance the assay performance and to remove any subjectivity associated with operator interpretation of result, we engineered a novel hand-held smart diagnostic device. The robust diagnostic device was further furnished with automated image acquisition and processing algorithms, and the collated data was processed through artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines to further reduce the assay run time and the subjectivity of the colorimetric LAMP detection. This advanced AI algorithm-implemented LAMP (ai-LAMP) assay, targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene, showed high analytical sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2. A total of [~]200 coronavirus disease (CoVID-19)-suspected patient samples were tested using the platform and it was shown to be reliable, highly specific and significantly more sensitive than the current gold standard qRT-PCR.

4798,FALSE-NEGATIVE RESULTS OF INITIAL RT-PCR ASSAYS FOR COVID-19: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW,"BackgroundA false-negative case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2) infection is defined as a person with suspected infection and an initial negative result by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, with a positive result on a subsequent test. False-negative cases have important implications for isolation and risk of transmission of infected people and for the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to review and critically appraise evidence about the rate of RT-PCR false-negatives at initial testing for COVID-19.

MethodsWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, as well as COVID-19 repositories including the EPPI-Centre living systematic map of evidence about COVID-19 and the Coronavirus Open Access Project living evidence database. Two authors independently screened and selected studies according to the eligibility criteria and collected data from the included studies. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. We calculated the proportion of false-negative test results with the corresponding 95% CI using a multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression model. The certainty of the evidence about false- negative cases was rated using the GRADE approach for tests and strategies. All information in this article is current up to July 17, 2020.

ResultsWe included 34 studies enrolling 12,057 COVID-19 confirmed cases. All studies were affected by several risks of bias and applicability concerns. The pooled estimate of false-negative proportion was highly affected by unexplained heterogeneity (tau-squared= 1.39; 90% prediction interval from 0.02 to 0.54). The certainty of the evidence was judged as very low, due to the risk of bias, indirectness, and inconsistency issues.

ConclusionsThere is a substantial and largely unexplained heterogeneity in the proportion of false-negative RT-PCR results. The collected evidence has several limitations, including risk of bias issues, high heterogeneity, and concerns about its applicability. Nonetheless, our findings reinforce the need for repeated testing in patients with suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection given that up to 54% of COVID-19 patients may have an initial false-negative RT-PCR (certainty of evidence: very low). An update of this review when additional studies become available is warranted.

14911,Assessing the influence of climate on future wintertime SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks,"High susceptibility has limited the role of the climate in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to date. However, understanding a possible future effect of climate, as susceptibility declines and the northern-hemisphere winter approaches, is an important open question. Here we use an epidemiological model, constrained by observations, to assess the sensitivity of future SARS-CoV-2 disease trajectories to local climate conditions. We find this sensitivity depends on both the susceptibility of the population and the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical controls (NPIs) in reducing transmission. Assuming high susceptibility, more stringent NPIs may be required to minimize outbreak risk in the winter months. Our results imply a role for meteorological forecasts in projecting outbreak severity, however, reducing uncertainty in epidemiological parameters will likely have a greater impact on generating accurate predictions and reflects the strong leverage of NPIs on future outbreak severity.","Baker, R.

Using recently published deaths figures for 1,689 Italian municipalities, we estimate the growth in daily mortality rates between the period 2015-2019 and 2020 by province. All provinces that experienced a major COVID-19 shock in mid-March 2020 had increases in mortality rates of 100% or above already in early February 2020. This increase was particularly strong for males and older people, two recognizable features of COVID-19. Using a panel fixed effect model, we show that the association between these early increases in mortality for any cause and the March 2020 COVID-19 shock is strong and significant. We conclude that the growth in mortality rates can be used as a statistically reliable predictor of COVID-19 crises.","Ceriani, L.; Hernandez-Suarez, C.; Verme, P.",2020-05-05,Health Economics,10.1101/2020.04.28.20083261,1,Paolo Verme,World bank group,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20083261v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20083261v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
20314,"Genomic characterization of a novel SARS-CoV-2 lineage from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","In this study, we report the sequencing of 180 new viral genomes obtained from different municipalities of the state of Rio de Janeiro from April to December 2020. We identified a novel lineage of SARS-CoV-2, originated from B.1.1.28, distinguished by five single-nucleotide variants (SNVs): C100U, C28253U, G28628U, G28975U, and C29754U. The SNV G23012A (E484K), in the receptor-binding domain of Spike protein, was widely spread across the samples. This mutation was previously associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This novel lineage emerged in late July being first detected by us in late October and still mainly restricted to the capital of the state. However, as observed for other strains it can be rapidly spread in the state. The significant increase in the frequency of this lineage raises concerns about public health management and continuous need for genomic surveillance during the second wave of infections.

16000,Passive Microwave Radiometry (MWR) for diagnostics of COVID-19 lung complications.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic. It becomes clear that the virus is spreading mostly deadly due to limited access to diagnostics tests and equipment. Traditional radiography and CT remain the main methods of the initial examination of the chest organs. Now, most of the diagnostics has been focused on PCR, chest X-Ray/CT manifestations of COVID-19. However, there are problems with CT due to infection control issues, the inefficiencies introduced in CT room decontamination, and lack of CT availability in LMIC (Low Middle Income Countries). Passive microwave radiometry (MWR) is a cheap, non-radioactive and portable technology. It has already been used for diagnostics of cancer, and other diseases. We have tested if MWR could be used for early diagnostics of pulmonary COVID-19 complications. This was a randomized controlled trial (195 subjects) to evaluate the effectiveness of diagnostics using MWR in patients with pneumonia caused by COVID-19 while they are in hospitals of Kyrgyzstan, and healthy individuals.

We have measured skin (IR) and internal (MWR) temperatures by recording passive electromagnetic radiation through the chest wall in the projection of the lungs at 30 symmetrical points on both sides. Pneumonia and lung damage were diagnosed by X-RAY/CT scan and doctor final diagnosis (pn+/pn-). COVID-19 was determined by PCR test (covid+/covid-). The best results were obtained between pn-/covid- and pn+/covid+ groups with sensitivity 92% and specificity 75%.Overall, the study suggests that the use of MWR is a convenient and safe method for screening diagnostics in COVID-19 patients with suspected pneumonia. Since MWR is an inexpensive, it will ease the financial burden for both patients and the countries, especially in LMIC

Summary statementCategorization of COVID-19 caused pneumonia suspicion by MWR has good diagnostic perspectives. It could be done in clinics or for mass screening to identify potential COVID-19 patients with lung complications.

BackgroundThe use of chest CT for COVID-19 and PCR diagnosis in healthcare settings with limited PCR and CT capacity is controversial. MWR categorization of the level of COVID-19 suspicion of lung complications might improve diagnostic performance.

PurposeTo investigate the value of MWR in addition to CT and COVID-19 PCR scans and to determine its diagnostic performance in individuals with COVID-19 symptoms during hospital admission and rehabilitation.

Materials and MethodsIn this trial (Kyrgyz Committee Clinical Trial Number: 01-2/141 27 May 2020), from June, 1 2020 to August, 1 2020, we performed parallel MWR, PCR and CT tests, for individuals with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital for medical emergencies related to COVID-19 and pneumonia suspicion. Siemens Ecoline CT scanner, and HITACHI, Radnext 50 Chest X-Ray was used. RT-PCR test were done using """"DNA technology"""" company https://www.dna-technology.ru/equipmentpr/nabory-reagentov-dlya-pcr-infekcii-respiratornogo-trakta/sars-cov-2sars-cov). For MWR and IR measurements RTM-01-RES was used MMWR LTD, UK (www.mmwr.co.uk)

ResultsThis was a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of diagnostics of COVID-19 (covid-/covid+) and pneumonia (pn+/pn-) using passive microwave radiometry (MWR) in patients while they are in hospital, and healthy individuals. We have measured internal (MWR) and skin (IR) temperature on 195 subjects. 149 of them were hospitalized with pneumonia symptoms to Medical center of KSMA and BICARD clinic. Pneumonia and lung damage were diagnosed by X-RAY/CT scans and radiologists lung damage assessment (pn+/pn-). COVID-19 was determined by PCR test (covid+/covid-). The best diagnostics results were obtained between pn-/covid- and pn+/covid+ groups with sensitivity 92% and specificity 75%.

ConclusionThe study suggests that the use of MWR is a convenient and safe method for screening diagnostics in COVID-19 patients with suspected pneumonia. Since MWR is inexpensive, it will ease the financial burden for both patients and the countries, especially in LMIC.","Osmonov, B.; Ovchinnikov, L.; Galazis, C.; Emilov, B.; Karaibragimov, M.; Seitov, M.; Vesnin, S.; Kasymbekov, T.; Mustafin, C.; Goryanin, I.",2020-10-19,Radiology And Imaging,10.1101/2020.09.29.20202598,2,Igor Goryanin,University of Edinburgh,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.29.20202598v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.29.20202598v2.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"

Study designNational cross sectional community survey.

SettingAustralian general public.

ParticipantsAdults aged over 18 years (n = 4362).

Main outcome measuresKnowledge, attitudes and behaviours related to COVID-19; health literacy and socio-demographic factors.

ResultsPeople with inadequate health literacy had poorer understanding of COVID-19 symptoms (49% vs 68%; p<0.001), were less able to identify behaviours to prevent infection (59% vs 72%; p<0.001), and experienced more difficulty finding information and understanding government messaging about COVID-19 than people with adequate health literacy. They were less likely to rate social distancing as important (6.1 vs 6.5, p<0.001) and reported more difficulty remembering/accessing medication since lockdown (3.6 vs 2.7, p<0.001). Importantly there was higher endorsement of misinformation beliefs related to COVID-19 and vaccination in people with lower health literacy. Similar results were observed among people who primarily speak a language other than English at home.

ConclusionOur findings show important disparities by health literacy and language in COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours that have the potential to undermine efforts to reduce viral transmission and may lead to social inequalities in health outcomes in Australia. Those with the greatest burden of chronic disease are most disadvantaged, and most likely to experience severe disease and die from COVID-19.

We systematically investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in mainland China to guide diagnosis and treatment. We searched the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and SSRN databases for studies related to COVID-19 published or preprinted in English or Chinese from January 1 to March 15, 2020. Clinical studies on COVID-19 performed in mainland China were included. We collected primary outcomes including signs and symptoms, chest CT imaging, laboratory tests, and treatments. Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. Qualitative and quantitative synthesis was conducted, and random-effects models were applied to pooled estimates. This study is registered with PROSPERO (number CRD42020171606). Of the 3624 records identified, 147 studies (20,662 patients) were analyzed. The mean age of patients with COVID-19 was 49.40 years, 53.45% were male, and 38.52% had at least one comorbidity. Fever and cough were the most common symptoms, followed by fatigue, expectoration, and shortness of breath. Most patients with COVID-19 had abnormal chest CT findings with ground glass opacity (70.70%) or consolidation (29.91%). Laboratory findings shown lymphopenia, increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased infection-related indicators, and fibrinolytic hyperactivity. Antiviral therapy, antibiotic therapy, and corticosteroids were administered to 89.75%, 79.13%, and 35.64% of patients, respectively. Most clinical characteristics of COVID-19 are non-specific.

DesignPopulation-based prospective cohort study on archive data.

SettingPreventive services and hospital care in the province of Reggio Emilia, Northern Italy.

ParticipantsAll 2653 symptomatic patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from February 27 to April 2, 2020 in the province of Reggio Emilia.

Main outcome measuresHospitalization and death up to April 2, 2020.

ResultsFemales had higher prevalence of infection than males below age 50 (2.61 vs. 1.84 {per thousand}), but lower in older ages (16.49 vs. 20.86 {per thousand} over age 80). Case fatality rate reached 20.7% (22/106) in cases with more than 4 weeks follow up. After adjusting for age and comorbidities, men had a higher risk of hospitalization (hazard ratio (HR) 1.4 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.2 to 1.6) and of death (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.1). Patients over age 80 compared to < age 50 had HR 7.1 (95% CI 5.4 to 9.3) and HR 27.8 (95% CI 12.5 to 61.7) for hospitalization and death, respectively. Immigrants had a higher risk of hospitalization (HR 1.3, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.81) than Italians and a similar risk of death. Risk of hospitalization and of death were higher in patients with heart failure (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.1and HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.6 to 3.2, respectively), arrhythmia (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.9 and HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.5, respectively), dementia (HR 1.2, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.8 and HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.8, respectively), ischemic heart disease (HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.7 and HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.5, respectively), diabetes (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 1.9 and HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.2, respectively), and hypertensions(HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.6 and HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.1, respectively), while COPD increased the risk of hospitalization (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.5) but not of death (HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.7). Previous use of ACE inhibitors has no effect on risk of death (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.34)

ConclusionsThe mechanisms underlying these associations are mostly unknown.

11895,A Contact-Explicit Covid-19 Epidemic and Response Assessment Model,"We formulate a refined SEIR epidemic model that explicitly includes a contact class C that either thwarts pathogen invasion and returns to the susceptible class S or progresses successively through latent, asymptomatic, and symptomatic classes L, A, and I. Individuals in both A and I may go directly to an immune class V, and in I to a dead class D. We extend this SCLAIV formulation by including a set of drivers that can be used to develop policy to manage current Covid-19 and similar type disease outbreaks. These drivers include surveillance, social distancing (rate and efficacy), social relaxation, quarantining (linked to contact tracing), patient treatment/isolation and vaccination processes, each of which can be represented by a non-negative constant or an s-shaped switching flow. The latter are defined in terms of onset and switching times, initial and final values, and abruptness of switching. We built a Covid-19NMB-DASA web app to generate both deterministic and stochastic solutions to our SCLAIV and drivers model and use incidence and mortality data to provide both maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) and Bayesian MCMC fitting of parameters. In the context of South African and English Covid-19 incidence data we demonstrate how to both identify and evaluate the role of drivers in ongoing outbreaks. In particular, we show that early social distancing in South Africa likely averted around 80,000 observed cases (actual number is double if only half the cases are observed) during the months of June and July. We also demonstrated that incidence rates in South Africa will increase to between a conservative estimate of 15 and 30 thousand observed cases per day (at a 50% surveillance level) by the end of August if stronger social distancing measures are not effected during July and August, 2020. On different a note, we show that comparably good local MLE fits of the English data using surveillance, social distancing and social relaxation drivers can represent very different kinds of outbreaks--one with close to 90% and another with under 8% immune individuals. This latter result provides a cautionary tale of why fitting SEIR-like models to incidence or prevalence data can be extremely problematic when not anchored by other critical measures, such as levels of immunity in the population. Our presentation illustrates how our SCLAIV formulation can be used to carry out forensic and scenario analyses of disease outbreaks such as Covid-19 in well defined regions.","Getz, W.

21048,Modeling the impact of racial and ethnic disparities on COVID-19 epidemic dynamics,"The impact of variable infection risk by race and ethnicity on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread is largely unknown. Here, we fit structured compartmental models to seroprevalence data from New York State and analyze how herd immunity thresholds (HITs), final sizes, and epidemic risk changes across groups. A simple model where interactions occur proportionally to contact rates reduced the HIT, but more realistic models of preferential mixing within groups increased the threshold toward the value observed in homogeneous populations. Across all models, the burden of infection fell disproportionately on minority populations: in a model fit to Long Island serosurvey and census data, 81% of Hispanics or Latinos were infected when the HIT was reached compared to 34% of non-Hispanic whites. Our findings, which are meant to be illustrative and not best estimates, demonstrate how racial and ethnic disparities can impact epidemic trajectories and result in unequal distributions of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ma, K.

16691,Preventing COVID-19 spread in closed facilities by regular testing of employees - an efficient intervention in long-term care facilities and prisons?,"BackgroundDifferent levels of control measures were introduced to contain the global COVID-19 pandemic, many of which have been controversial, particularly the comprehensive use of diagnostic tests. Regular testing of high-risk individuals (pre-existing conditions, older than 60 years of age) has been suggested by public health authorities. The WHO suggested the use of routine screening of residents, employees, and visitors of long-term care facilities (LTCF) to protect the resident risk group. Similar suggestions have been made by the WHO for other closed facilities including incarceration facilities (e.g., prisons or jails), wherein parts of the U.S., accelerated release of approved inmates is taken as a measure to mitigate COVID-19.

Methods and findingsHere, the simulation model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) is extended to investigate the effect of regularly testing of employees to protect immobile resident risk groups in closed facilities. The reduction in the number of infections and deaths within the risk group is investigated. Our simulations are adjusted to reflect the situation of LTCFs in Germany, and incarceration facilities in the U.S.

COVID-19 spreads in closed facilities due to contact with infected employees even under strict confinement of visitors in a pandemic scenario without targeted protective measures. Testing is only effective in conjunction with targeted contact reduction between the closed facility and the outside world - and will be most inefficient under strategies aiming for herd immunity. The frequency of testing, the quality of tests, and the waiting time for obtaining test results have noticeable effects. The exact reduction in the number of cases depends on disease prevalence in the population and the levels of contact reductions. Testing every 5 days with a good quality test and a processing time of 24 hours can lead up to a 40% reduction in the number of infections. However, the effects of testing vary substantially among types of closed facilities and can even be counterproductive in U.S. IFs.

ConclusionsThe introduction of COVID-19 in closed facilities is unavoidable without a thorough screening of persons that can introduce the disease into the facility. Regular testing of employees in closed facilities can contribute to reducing the number of infections there, but is only meaningful as an accompanying measure, whose economic benefit needs to be assessed carefully.","Tsoungui Obama, H.

9170,"THE ERA OF CORONAVIRUS; KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE, PRACTICES, AND BARRIERS TO HAND HYGIENE AMONG MAKERERE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND KATANGA COMMUNITY RESIDENTS.","BackgroundChina reported the Novel Coronavirus at the end of the year 2019 which was, later on, declared a Pandemic by the WHO. Proper hand hygiene was identified as one of the simplest most cost-effective Covid-19 control and prevention measures. It is therefore very important to understand the compliance of the community to hand hygiene.

MethodA descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among the undergraduate students of Makerere University and residents of Katanga slum from 17th to 22nd of March, 2020. An interviewer guided questionnaire with questions on knowledge, attitude, practice, and barriers to hand hygiene was used in data collection. The collected data was analyzed using Microsoft office excel 2016 and STATA 15 software. A 95% confidence interval was used and statistical significance was P<0.05.

ResultsOnly 8.4% of the participants had good knowledge of hand hygiene. 11.7% of the university students had good knowledge compared to 0.9% of the Katanga residents. 29.0% of the participants had a good attitude while 50.1% had a moderate attitude to hand hygiene. University students were 6.3 times (OR: 6.3, 95%C1: (2.1 - 18.5), P=0.001) more likely to have good knowledge while Katanga residents were 3.6 times (OR: 3.6, 95%C1: (1.5 - 8.4), P=0.003) more likely to have good attitude to hand hygiene. Only 19.6% accomplished all the seven steps of handwashing. 38.4% of the participants still greeted by handshaking and 60.1% noted lack of soap as a barrier to hand hygiene and 62.9% reported having more than three barriers to hand hygiene. Participants that had been taught handwashing were more likely to have better hand hygiene knowledge and practice.

ConclusionDespite a fair attitude, deficiency of knowledge coupled with many barriers such as Lack of soap hindered the Practice of proper hand hygiene. Public health involvement to promote hand hygiene must be promoted.","Nuwagaba, J.; Ashok, D. D.; Balizzakiwa, T.; Kisengula, I.; Nagaddya, E.

While children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they can present with a SARS-CoV-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) similar to Kawasakis disease. Here, we show distinct antibody (Ab) responses in children with MIS-C compared to adults with severe COVID-19 causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and those who recovered from mild disease. There was a reduced breadth and specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in MIS-C patients compared to the COVID patient groups; MIS-C predominantly generated IgG Abs specific for the Spike (S) protein but not for the nucleocapsid (N) protein, while the COVID-19 cohorts had anti-S IgG, IgM and IgA Abs, as well as anti-N IgG Abs. Moreover, MIS-C patients had reduced neutralizing activity compared to both COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response. These results suggest a distinct infection course and immune response in children and adults who develop severe disease, with implications for optimizing treatments based on symptom and age.","Weisberg, S.

Our study describes the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to ICU in the largest health care system in the state of Florida, United States.

MethodsRetrospective cohort study of patients admitted to ICU due to severe COVID-19 in AdventHealth health system in Orlando, Florida from March 11th until May 18th, 2020. Patients were characterized based on demographics, baseline comorbidities, severity of illness, medical management including experimental therapies, laboratory markers and ventilator parameters. Major clinical outcomes analyzed at the end of the study period were: hospital and ICU length of stay, MV-related mortality and overall hospital mortality of ICU patients.

ResultsOut of total of 1283 patients with COVID-19, 131 (10.2%) met criteria for ICU admission (median age: 61 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 49.5-71.5]; 35.1% female). Common comorbidities were hypertension (84; 64.1%), and diabetes (54; 41.2%). Of the 131 ICU patients, 109 (83.2%) required MV and 9 (6.9%) received ECMO. Lower positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) were observed in survivors [9.2 (7.7-10.4)] vs non-survivors [10 (9.1-12.9] p= 0.004]. Compared to non-survivors, survivors had a longer MV length of stay (LOS) [14 (IQR 8-22) vs 8.5 (IQR 5-10.8) p< 0.001], Hospital LOS [21 (IQR 13-31) vs 10 (7-1) p< 0.001] and ICU LOS [14 (IQR 7-24) vs 9.5 (IQR 6-11), p < 0.001]. The overall hospital mortality and MV-related mortality were 19.8% and 23.8% respectively. After exclusion of hospitalized patients, the hospital and MV-related mortality rates were 21.6% and 26.5% respectively.

ConclusionsOur study demonstrates an important improvement in mortality of patients with severe COVID-19 who required ICU admission and MV in comparison to previous observational reports and emphasize the importance of standard of care measures in the management of COVID-19.","Oliveira, E.; Parikh, A.; Lopez-Ruiz, A.; Carrillo, M.; Goldberg, J.; Cearras, M.; Fernainy, K.; Andersen, S.; Mercado, L.; Guan, J.; Zafar, H.; Louzon, P.; Carr, A.; Baloch, N.; Pratley, R.; Silvestry, S.; Hsu, V.; Sniffen, J.; Herrera, V.; Finkler, N.",2020-08-31,Intensive Care And Critical Care Medicine,10.1101/2020.08.25.20181909,1,Eduardo Oliveira,AdventHealth Orlando,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.25.20181909v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.25.20181909v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1371/journal.pone.0249038
27132,Increased prevalence and clinical impact of hypocalcaemia in severe COVID-19 distinguishes it from other forms of infective pneumonia,"BackgroundHypocalcaemia has been reported in the context of acute COVID-19, where it has been associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation and disease severity. Calcium is an important intracellular messenger that controls diverse cellular processes. Two other clinically important coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, can use calcium ions to enter and replicate within host cells. Calcium may therefore be important in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection. We sought to investigate whether calcium derangement was a specific feature of COVID-19 that distinguishes it from other infective pneumonias, and its association with disease severity.

MethodsWe conducted a single centre retrospective study of albumin-corrected serum calcium on adult patients with COVID-19 who presented between March 1st and May 16th 2020. The primary outcome was maximal level of care based on the World Health Organization Clinical Progression Scale for COVID-19. Cases with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and viral pneumonia (VP) were identified through a clinical database over three intervals (January to February 2018, January to February 2019 and September to December 2019).

ResultsWe analysed data from 506 patients with COVID-19, 95 patients with CAP and 152 patients with VP. Hypocalcaemia (serum calcium <2.2mmol/L) was a specific and common clinical finding in patients with COVID-19 that was not present in other respiratory infections. Calcium levels were significantly lower in those with severe disease. Ordinal regression of risk estimates for categorised care levels showed that baseline hypocalcaemia was incrementally associated with odds ratio of 2.33 for higher level of care, superior to other variables that have previously been shown to predict worse COVID-19 outcome. Serial calcium levels showed improvement by day 7-9 of admission, only in in survivors of COVID-19.

ConclusionHypocalcaemia may independently predict not only more severe but more progressive disease and warrants detailed prognostic investigation. The fact that decreased serum calcium is observed at the time of clinical presentation in COVID-19, but not other infective pneumonias, suggests that its early derangement is pathophysiological and may influence the deleterious evolution of this disease. If calcium is ultimately shown to be critical to the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells, unravelling how this mechanism could be therapeutically targeted deserves more intensive examination.

2600,The effects of border control and quarantine measures on global spread of COVID-19,"The rapid expansion of coronavirus (COVID-19) has been observed in many parts of the world. Many newly reported cases of this new coronavirus during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases). For those cases without travel history, the risk of wider spreads through community contact is even higher. However, most population models assume a homogeneous infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases can pose a different risk to community spread.

We have developed an """"easy-to-use"""" mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported, secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered. Using the dynamics of the secondary cases, we are able to determine the probability of community spread.

Using the top 10 visiting cities from Wuhan in China as an example, we first demonstrated that the arrival time and the dynamics of the outbreaks at these cities can be successfully predicted under the reproductive number R0 = 2.92 and latent period{tau} = 5.2 days. Next, we showed that although control measures can gain extra 32.5 and 44.0 days in arrival time through a high intensive border control measure and a shorter time to quarantine under a low R0 (1.4), if the R0 is higher (2.92), only 10 extra days can be gained for each of the same measures. This suggests the importance of lowering the incidence at source regions together with infectious disease control measures in susceptible regions. The study allows us to assess the effects of border control and quarantine measures on the emergence and the global spread in a fully connected world using the dynamics of the secondary cases.","Hossain, M.

9328,COVID-19 related mortality and spread of disease in long-term care: a living systematic review of emerging evidence,"BackgroundPolicy responses to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-term care (LTC) require robust and timely evidence on mortality and spread of the disease in these settings. The aim of this living systematic review is to synthesise early international evidence on mortality rates and incidence of COVID-19 among people who use and provide LTC.

MethodsWe report findings of a living systematic review (CRD42020183557), including studies identified through database searches up to 26 June 2020. We searched seven databases (MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL Plus; Web of Science; Global Health; WHO COVID-19 Research Database; medRxiv) to identify all studies reporting primary data on COVID-19 related mortality and incidence of disease among LTC users and staff. We excluded studies not focusing on LTC. Included studies were critically appraised and results on number of deaths and COVID-19 related mortality rates, case fatality rates, and excess deaths (co-primary outcomes), as well as incidence of disease, hospitalisations, and ICU admissions were synthesised narratively.

FindingsA total of 54 study reports for 49 unique primary studies or outbreak reports were included. Outbreak investigations in LTC facilities found COVID-19 incidence rates of between 0.0% and 71.7% among residents and between 0.4% and 64.0% among staff at affected facilities. Mortality rates varied from 0.0% to 17.1% of all residents at outbreak facilities, with case fatality rates between 0.0% and 33.7%. In included studies of outbreaks, no LTC staff members had died.

Studies of wider LTC populations found that between 0.4% and 40.8% of users, and between 4.0% and 23.8% of staff were infected, although the generalisability of these studies is limited.

There was limited information on the impact of COVID-19 on LTC in the community.

InterpretationLong-term care users have been particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we found wide variation in spread of disease and mortality rates between outbreaks at individual LTC facilities. Further research into the factors determining successful prevention and containment of COVID-19 outbreaks is needed to protect long-term care users and staff.

18342,Performance of SARS-CoV-2 Serology tests: Are they good enough?,"BackgroundIn the emergency of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, great efforts were made to quickly provide serology testing to the medical community however, these methods have been introduced into clinical practice without the complete validation usually required by the regulatory organizations.

MethodsSARS-CoV-2 patient samples (n=43) were analysed alongside pre-pandemic control specimen (n=50), confirmed respiratory infections (n=50), inflammatory polyarthritis (n=22) and positive for thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (n=30). Imprecision, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and concordance were evaluated on IgG serologic assays from EuroImmun, Epitope Diagnostics (EDI), Abbott Diagnostics and DiaSorin and a rapid IgG/IgM test from Healgen.

ResultsEDI and EuroImmun imprecision was 0.02-14.0% CV. Abbott and DiaSorin imprecision (CV) ranged from 5.2% - 8.1% and 8.2% - 9.6% respectively. Diagnostic sensitivity of the assays were 100% (CI: 80-100%) for Abbott, EDI and EuroImmun and 95% (CI: 73-100%) for DiaSorin at [&ge;]14 days post PCR. Only the Abbott assay had a diagnostic specificity of 100% (CI: 91-100%). EuroImmun cross-reacted in 3 non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections and 2 controls. The DiaSorin displayed more false negative results and cross-reacted in six cases across all conditions tested. EDI had one cross-reactive sample. The Healgen rapid test showed excellent sensitivity and specificity. Overall, concordance of the assays ranged from 76.1% to 97.9%.

ConclusionsSerological tests for SARS-CoV-2 showed good analytical performance. The head-to-head analysis of samples revealed differences in results that may be linked to the use of nucleocapsid or spike proteins.

12929,"Peripheral innate and adaptive immune cells during COVID-19: Functional neutrophils, pro-inflammatory monocytes and half-dead lymphocytes","A better understanding of the innate and adaptive cells in the COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is a necessity for the development of effective treatment methods and vaccines. We studied phenotypic features of innate and adaptive immune cells, oxidative burst, phagocytosis and apoptosis. One hundred and three patients with COVID-19 grouped according to their clinical features as mild (35%), moderate (40.8%), and severe (24.3%) were included in the study. Monocytes from all COVID-19 patients were CD16+ pro-inflammatory monocytes. Neutrophils were mature and functional. No defect has been found in ROS production of monocytes and neutrophils as well as no defect in their apoptosis. As bridging cells of the innate and adaptive immune system; the percentage of NK cells was in normal range whereas the percentages of CD3-CD8+CD56+ innate lymphoid and CD3+CD56+ NK like T cells were found to be high in the severe cases of COVID-19. Although absolute numbers of all lymphocyte subsets were low and showed a tendency for a gradual decrease in accord with the disease progression, in all COVID-19 patients, the lymphocyte subset with the most decreased absolute number was B lymphocytes, followed by CD4 + T cells in the severe cases. The percentages of suppressive, CD3+CD4-CD8-; HLA-DR+CD3+ and CD28-CD8+ cells were found to be significantly increased. Importantly, we demonstrated spontaneous caspase-3 activation and increased lymphocyte apoptosis. Altogether our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects lymphocytes not innate cells. So that, it may interrupt the cross-talk between adaptive and innate immune systems.","Eksioglu-Demiralp, E.; Alan, S.; Sili, U.; Bakan, D.; Ocak, I.; Yurekli, R.; Alpay, N.; Gorcin, S.; Yildiz, A.",2020-08-04,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.01.20166587,1,Emel Eksioglu-Demiralp,"Istanbul Memorial Sisli Hospital, Tissue Typing and Immunology Laboratory",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.01.20166587v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.01.20166587v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"

MethodsWe performed an analytical cross-sectional observational study. We included patients with COVID-19 pneumonia treated at the """"Dos de Mayo"""" National Hospital. Patients over 18 years old with a diagnosis confirmed by rapid or molecular testing were included. Those with an incomplete, illegible, or missing medical history and/or bacterial or fungal pneumonia were excluded. Data were extracted from medical records. The primary outcomes were mortality and admission to the ICU. The Call Score was calculated for each patient (4 to 13 points) and classified into three risk groups. Summary measures were presented for qualitative and quantitative variables. The area under the model curve and the operational characteristics (sensitivity, specificity) were calculated for the best cut-off point.

ResultsThe Call Score reported an area under the curve of 0.59 (IC95%: 0.3 to 0.07), p = 0.43 for predicting death. However, for a cut-off point of 5.5, a sensitivity of 87%and a specificity of 65%were obtained. The area under the curve for ICU admission was 0.67 (95%CI: 0.3 to 0.07), p = 0.43; the 5.5 cut-off point showed a sensitivity of 82%and a specificity of 51%.

10107,Modelling for prediction of the spread and severity of COVID-19 and its association with socioeconomic factors and virus types,"We report the development of a Weibull based Long-Short-Term-Memory approach (W-LSTM) for the prediction of COVID-19 disease. The W-LSTM model developed in this study, performs better in terms of MSE, R2 and MAPE, as compared to the previously published models, including ARIMA, LSTM and their variations. Using W-LSTM model, we have predicted the beginning and end of the current cycle of COVID-19 in several countries. Performance of the model was validated as satisfactory in 82% of the 50 test countries, while asking for prediction for 10 days beyond the period of training. Accuracy of the above prediction with days beyond training was assessed in comparison with the MAPE that the model gave with cumulative global data. The model was applied to study correlation between the growth of infection and deaths, and a number of effectors that may influence the epidemic. The model identified age groups, trade with China, air traffic, country temperature and CoV-2 virus types as the likely effectors of infection and virulence leading to deaths. The predictors likely to promote or suppress the epidemic were identified. Some of the predictors had significant effect on the shape parameters of Weibull distribution. The model can function on cloud, take inputs in real time and handle large data country wise, at low costs to make predictions dynamically. Such predictions are highly valuable in guiding policy makers, administration and health.

5092,"A model-based evaluation of the efficacy of COVID-19 social distancing, testing and hospital triage policies","We present a stochastic compartmental network model of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 exploring the effects of policy choices in three domains: social distancing, hospital triaging, and testing. We distinguished between high-risk and low-risk members of the population, and modeled differences in social interactions due to context, risk level, infection status, and testing status. The model incorporates many of the currently important characteristics of the disease, including overcapacity in the healthcare system and uncertainties surrounding the proportion and transmission potential of asymptomatic cases. We compared current policy guidelines from public health agencies with alternative options, and investigated the effects of policy decisions on the overall proportion of COVID-19-related deaths. Our results support current policies to contain the outbreak but also suggest possible refinements, including emphasizing the need to reduce public, random contacts more than private contacts, and testing low-risk symptomatic individuals before high-risk symptomatic individuals. Our model furthermore points to interactions among the three policy domains; the efficacy of a particular policy choice depends on other implemented policies. Finally, our results provide an explanation for why societies like Germany, with lower average rates of social contact, are more successful at containing the outbreak than highly social societies such as Italy, despite the implementation of similar policy measures.","Mccombs, A.; Kadelka, C.",2020-04-23,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.20.20073213,1,Claus Kadelka,Iowa State University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.20073213v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.20073213v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008388

Testing at individual building-level could be an efficient, passive means of preventing early detection of new cases in congregate living settings, but this approach has not been validated. Sample collection protocols were developed and refined during preliminary sampling from a hospital and a local municipal wastewater treatment plant. Molecular diagnostic methods were compared side-by-side to assess feasibility, performance and sensitivity. Optimized sample collection and processing protocols were then used to monitor two occupied dormitory complexes (n=105 and 66) over eight weeks. Wastewater results were validated using known case counts from external clinical testing of building occupants. Results confirm that ultracentrifugation from a 24 hour composite collection had a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 100%. However, if the detection of convalescent shedding is considered a false positive then the sensitivity would be 95.2% but the specificity would drop to 52%. We determined a highly sensitive method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 shedding in building wastewater however our methods could not distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

It is widely recognized that mass testing is an efficient way to contain the infection spread as well as the development of informed policies for disease management. However, the current COVID-19 worldwide infection rates increased demand in the rapid and reliable screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We compared the performance of qRT-PCR in direct heat-inactivated, heat-inactivated/pelleted samples against RNA in a group of 74 subjects (44 positive and 30 negative). In addition, we compared the sensitivity of heat-inactivated/pelleted in another group of 196 COVID-19 positive samples.

Our study suggests that swab sample heat-inactivation and pelleting show higher accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 detection PCR assay compared to heat-inactivation only (89% vs 83% of the detection in RNA). The accuracy of detection using direct samples varied depending on the sample transport and storage media as well as the concentration of viral particles.

Our study suggests that purified RNA provides more accurate results, however, direct qRT-PCR may help to significantly increase testing capacity.

MethodThis study enrolled a total of 178 patients at Huangshi Central Hospital from January to February, 2020. Among them, 68 patients were SARS-COV-2 infected confirmed with nucleic acid test (NAT) and CT imaging. 9 patients were in the suspected group (NAT negative) with fever and other respiratory symptoms. 101 patients were in the control group with other diseases and negative to SARS-COV-2 infection. After serum samples were collected, SARS-COV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were tested by chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for all patients.

ResultsThe specificity of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-COV-2 were 99.01% (100/101) and 96.04% (97/101) respectively, and the sensitivity were 88.24% (60/68) and 97.06% (66/68) respectively. The combined detection rate of SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were 98.53% (67/68).

14611,Dynamic Network Strategies for SARS-CoV-2 Control on a Cruise Ship,"SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have occurred on several nautical vessels, driven by the high-density contact networks on these ships. Optimal strategies for prevention and control that account for realistic contact networks are needed. We developed a network-based transmission model for SARS-CoV-2 on the Diamond Princess outbreak to characterize transmission dynamics and to estimate the epidemiological impact of outbreak control and prevention measures. This model represented the dynamic multi-layer network structure of passenger-passenger, passengercrew, and crew-crew contacts, both before and after the large-scale network lockdown imposed on the ship in response to the disease outbreak. Model scenarios evaluated variations in the timing of the network lockdown, reduction in contact intensity within the sub-networks, and diagnosis-based case isolation on outbreak prevention. We found that only extreme restrictions in contact patterns during network lockdown and idealistic clinical response scenarios could avert a major COVID-19 outbreak. Contact network changes associated with adequate outbreak prevention were the restriction of passengers to their cabins, with limited passenger-crew contacts. Clinical response strategies required for outbreak prevention included early mass screening with an ideal PCR test (100% sensitivity) and immediate case isolation upon diagnosis. Public health restrictions on optional leisure activities like these should be considered until longer-term effective solutions such as a COVID-19 vaccine become widely available.","Jenness, S.

19972,Oxygen saturation instability in suspected covid-19 patients; contrasting effects of reduced VA/Q and shunt.,"Patients in the UK at risk of Covid-19 pneumonia, but not needing immediate hospital attention, are to be given pulse oximeters to identify a fall in oxygen saturation (SaO2 or SpO2) at home. A recent finding in Covid-19 pneumonia is a dominant reduction in ventilation to perfused alveoli (VA/Q). A mathematical model of gas exchange was used to predict the effect of shunt or reduced VA/Q on SaO2 stability inferred from the slope of the PIO2 vs SaO2 curve as it intersected the line representing ambient PIO2. A {+/-}1 kPa variation in PIO2 predicted a 1.5% and 8% change in SpO2 with 15% shunt and 0.4 VA/Q respectively. As a consistency check, two patients with pre-existing lung disease and 12 hour continuous SpO2 monitoring breathing air had gas exchange impairment analysed in terms of shunt and reduced VA/Q. The patient with 16% shunt and normal VA/Q had a stable but reduced SpO2 (circa 93{+/-}1%) throughout the 12 hr period. The patient with a VA/Q reduced to 0.48 had SpO2 ranging from 75-95% during the same period. SpO2 monitoring in suspected covid-19 patients should focus on SpO2 varying >5% in 30 minutes. Such instability in at risk patients is not diagnostic of Covid-19 pneumonia but this may be suspected from a dominant reduction in VA/Q if episodic hypoxaemia has progressed from a stable SpO2.","Jones, J.

14372,Sample Pooling is a Viable Strategy for SARS-CoV-2 Detection in Low-Prevalence Settings,"BACKGROUNDThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has significantly increased demand on laboratory throughput and reagents for nucleic acid extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Reagent shortages may limit the expansion of testing required to scale back isolation measures.

AIMTo investigate the viability of sample pooling as a strategy for increasing test throughput and conserving PCR reagents; to report our early experience with pooling of clinical samples.

METHODSA pre-implementation study was performed to assess the sensitivity and theoretical efficiency of two, four, and eight-sample pools in a real-time reverse transcription PCR-based workflow. A standard operating procedure was developed and implemented in two laboratories during periods of peak demand, inclusive of over 29,000 clinical samples processed in our laboratory.

RESULTSSensitivity decreased (mean absolute increase in cycle threshold value of 0.6, 2.3, and 3.0 for pools of two, four, and eight samples respectively) and efficiency increased as pool size increased. Gains from pooling diminished at high disease prevalence. Our standard operating procedure was successfully implemented across two laboratories. Increased workflow complexity imparts a higher risk of errors, and requires risk mitigation strategies. Turnaround time for individual samples increased, hence urgent samples should not be pooled.

CONCLUSIONSPooling is a viable strategy for high-throughput testing of SARS-CoV-2 in low-prevalence settings.","Chong, B. S.; Tran, T.; Druce, J.; Ballard, S. A.; Simpson, J.

13934,"Comparing the COVID-19 pandemic in space and over time in Europe, using numbers of deaths, crude rates and adjusted mortality trend ratios","BackgroundSince COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, attempts have been made to monitor trends over time and to compare countries and regions. Insufficient testing for COVID-19 underestimates the incidence and inflates the case-fatality proportion. Given the age- and sex- distribution of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, the underlying sex- and age-distribution of a population needs to be accounted for. The aim of this paper is to present a method for monitoring trends of COVID-19 using adjusted mortality trend ratios (AMTR).

MethodsAge- and sex-mortality distribution of a reference population composed of the first 14,086 fatalities which occurred before the end of March and were reported in Europe by some countries were used to calculate age- and sex-specific mortality rates per 1,000,000 population. These were applied to each country population to calculate the expected deaths. Adjusted Mortality Trend Ratios (AMTRs) with 95% confidence intervals (C.I.) were calculated for selected European countries from 17/03/2020 to 22/06/2020 by dividing observed cumulative mortality, by expected mortality times the crude mortality of the reference population. These estimated the sex- and age-adjusted mortality for COVID-19 per million population in each country.

ResultsThe cumulative mortality from COVID-19, the crude mortality rates, and the AMTRs were calculated for each country and compared. United Kingdom, Italy, France and Spain registered the highest mortality in Europe. On 22/06/2020 in Europe the total mortality rate from COVID-19 was 352 per 1,000,000 inhabitants; and it was highest in Belgium (850 per 1,000,000 inhabitants) followed by Spain, UK, Italy, Sweden and France. When accounting for the underlying age and sex structure of each country, Belgium remained the single country experiencing the highest AMTR of 929 per million inhabitants on 22/06/2020; however Ireland - which had a CMR in line with the total European population - emerged as having experienced a much more important impact of COVID-19 mortality with an AMTR of 550/million on 22/06/2020, higher than Sweden and Italy.

ConclusionsIn understanding and managing the pandemic of COVID-19, comparable international data is a priority. Our methods allow a fair comparison of mortality in space and over time. The authors urge the WHO, given the absence of age and sex-specific mortality data for direct standardisation, to adopt this method to estimate the comparative mortality from COVID-19 pandemic worldwide.

Key messageO_LIComparing trends of the COVID-19 pandemic over time and in space is essential to monitor the disease and compare different local policies
C_LIO_LIUsing the concept of indirect standardisation we propose a method to effectively compare age- and sex-adjusted mortality rates trends interpretable as deaths for COVID-19 per million inhabitants
C_LIO_LIApplying this methods, interesting features of the infection in Europe emerged; e.g. by 22/06/2020 Belgium is the most severely affected country with an AMTR of 929 per million inhabitants, followed by the UK; Ireland and Sweden rank fourth and fifth most affected country in Europe
C_LIO_LIThe WHO should consider using this method for monitoring the spread of COVID-19, which only requires recording the total number of death from COVID-19 from each country/region

4612,"A systematic review of antibody mediated immunity to coronaviruses: antibody kinetics, correlates of protection, and association of antibody responses with severity of disease","The duration and nature of immunity generated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Many public health responses and modeled scenarios for COVID-19 outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV-2 assume that infection results in an immune response that protects individuals from future infections or illness for some amount of time. The timescale of protection is a critical determinant of the future impact of the pathogen. The presence or absence of protective immunity due to infection or vaccination (when available) will affect future transmission and illness severity. The dynamics of immunity and nature of protection are relevant to discussions surrounding therapeutic use of convalescent sera as well as efforts to identify individuals with protective immunity. Here, we review the scientific literature on antibody immunity to coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 as well as the related SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and human endemic coronaviruses (HCoVs). We reviewed 1281 abstracts and identified 322 manuscripts relevant to 5 areas of focus: 1) antibody kinetics, 2) correlates of protection, 3) immunopathogenesis, 4) antigenic diversity and cross-reactivity, and 5) population seroprevalence. While studies of SARS-CoV-2 are necessary to determine immune responses to it, evidence from other coronaviruses can provide clues and guide future research.

17574,Simple discrete-time self-exciting models can describe complex dynamic processes: a case study of COVID-19,"Hawkes processes are a form of self-exciting process that has been used in numerous applications, including neuroscience, seismology, and terrorism. While these self-exciting processes have a simple formulation, they are able to model incredibly complex phenomena. Traditionally Hawkes processes are a continuous-time process, however we enable these models to be applied to a wider range of problems by considering a discrete-time variant of Hawkes processes. We illustrate this through the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a substantive case study. While alternative models, such as compartmental and growth curve models, have been widely applied to the COVID-19 epidemic, the use of discrete-time Hawkes processes allows us to gain alternative insights. This paper evaluates the capability of discrete-time Hawkes processes by retrospectively modelling daily counts of deaths as two distinct phases in the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak: the initial stage of exponential growth and the subsequent decline as preventative measures become effective. We consider various countries that have been adversely affected by the epidemic, namely, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. These countries are all unique concerning the spread of the virus and their corresponding response measures, in particular, the types and timings of preventative actions. However, we find that this simple model is useful in accurately capturing the dynamics of the process, despite hidden interactions that are not directly modelled due to their complexity, and differences both within and between countries. The utility of this model is not confined to the current COVID-19 epidemic, rather this model could be used to explain many other complex phenomena. It is of interest to have simple models that adequately describe these complex processes with unknown dynamics. As models become more complex, a simpler representation of the process can be desirable for the sake of parsimony.","Browning, R.; Sulem, D.; Mengersen, K.; Rivoirard, V.; Rousseau, J.",2020-11-03,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.28.20221077,1,Raiha Browning,Queensland University of Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.28.20221077v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.28.20221077v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1371/journal.pone.0250015
10754,"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 among primary and middle school students during the COVID-19 outbreak period in Beijing: An online cross-sectional survey","PurposeThis study investigated the KAP towards COVID-19 and their influencing factors among primary and middle school students during the self-quarantine period in Beijing.

MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study among students from 18 primary and middle schools in Beijing during March 2020. Stratified cluster sampling was conducted. Demographic and KAP-related COVID-19 information was collected through an online questionnaire. The influencing factors were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression.

ResultsA total of 7,377 students were included. The overall correct rate for COVID-19 knowledge was 74.1%, while only 31.5% and 40.5% could identify the high-risk places of cross-infection and warning body temperature. Although 94.5% of respondents believed the epidemic could be controlled, over 50% expressed various concerns about the epidemic. The compliance rates for basic preventing behaviors were all over 80%, while those for """"rational and effective ventilation"""" (39.2%) and """"dinning separately"""" (38.6%) were low. The KAP levels were significantly differed according to various school categories of students. The COVID-19 knowledge (OR= 3.309, 95% CI: 2.921, 3.748) and attitude (OR=1.145, 95% CI: 1.003, 1.308) were associated with preventive practices. Besides, female, urban students, those with a healthy lifestyle, and those with the willingness to engage in healthcare tended to have better preventive practices.

ConclusionMost students in Beijing hold a high level of knowledge, optimistic attitudes and have appropriate practices towards COVID-19. However, targeted interventions are still necessary, especially for students with high-risk characteristics.

Implications and contributionsThe performance and the potential factors of COVID-19-related knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) among students in primary and middle schools is still unclear.

This study investigates the characteristics and the level of KAP among students. The results of the study may contribute to the targeted education and interventions for students.","Wen, F.; Meng, Y.; Cao, H.; Xia, J.; Li, H.; Qi, H.; Meng, K.; Zhang, L.",2020-06-30,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.29.20138628,1,Ling Zhang,"Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemio",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.20138628v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.20138628v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"

In particular, single use disposable N95 face masks have been limited in supply. We have developed an Injection Molded Autoclavable, Scalable, Conformable (iMASC) system for aerosol-based protection. The iMASC system was designed as a reusable liquid silicone rubber mask with disposable N95 filter cartridges that can fit most face sizes and shapes. This system reduced the amount of N95 filter while preserving breathability and fit. Using finite element analysis, we demonstrated mask deformation and reaction forces from facial scans of twenty different wearers. In addition, we validated these findings by successful fit testing in twenty participants in a prospective clinical trial. The iMASC system has the potential to protect our healthcare workers with a reusable N95-comparable face mask that is rapidly scalable.","Traverso, C.; Byrne, J.

21238,The COVID-19 Infodemic: The complex task of elevating signal and eliminating noise.,"In Situation Report #3 and 39 days before declaring COVID-19 a pandemic, the WHO declared a -19 infodemic. The volume of coronavirus tweets was far too great for one to find accurate or reliable information. Healthcare workers were flooded with which drowned the of valuable COVID-19 information. To combat the infodemic, physicians created healthcare-specific micro-communities to share scientific information with other providers. We analyzed the content of eight physician-created communities and categorized each message in one of five domains. We coded 1) an application programming interface to download tweets and their metadata in JavaScript Object Notation and 2) a reading algorithm using visual basic application in Excel to categorize the content. We superimposed the publication date of each tweet into a timeline of key pandemic events. Finally, we created NephTwitterArchive.com to help healthcare workers find COVID-19-related signal tweets when treating patients. We collected 21071 tweets from the eight hashtags studied. Only 9051 tweets were considered signal: tweets categorized into both a domain and subdomain. There was a trend towards fewer signal tweets as the pandemic progressed, with a daily median of 22% (IQR 0-42%. The most popular subdomain in Prevention was PPE (2448 signal tweets). In Therapeutics, Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine wwo Azithromycin and Mechanical Ventilation were the most popular subdomains. During the active Infodemic phase (Days 0 to 49), a total of 2021 searches were completed in NephTwitterArchive.com, which was a 26% increase from the same time period before the pandemic was declared (Days -50 to -1). The COVID-19 Infodemic indicates that future endeavors must be undertaken to eliminate noise and elevate signal in all aspects of scientific discourse on Twitter. In the absence of any algorithm-based strategy, healthcare providers will be left with the nearly impossible task of manually finding high-quality tweets from amongst a tidal wave of noise.","Desai, T.; Conjeevaram, A.",2021-01-20,Medical Education,10.1101/2021.01.19.21249936,1,Tejas Desai,NOD Analytics,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.19.21249936v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.19.21249936v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"

Here we present a detailed analysis from a large population center in Southern California (Orange County, population of 3.2 million) to understand heterogeneity in risks of infection, test positivity, and death. We used a combination of datasets, including a population-representative seroprevalence survey, to assess the true burden of disease as well as COVID-19 testing intensity, test positivity, and mortality. In the first month of the local epidemic, case incidence clustered in high income areas. This pattern quickly shifted, with cases next clustering in much higher rates in the north-central area which has a lower socio-economic status. Since April, a concentration of reported cases, test positivity, testing intensity, and seropositivity in a north-central area persisted. At the individual level, several factors (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, zip codes with low educational attainment) strongly affected risk of seropositivity and death.","Parker, D.

9101,"Characteristics and risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis and adverse outcomes in Mexico: an analysis of 89,756 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases","BackgroundThere is insufficient information about risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis and adverse outcomes from low and middle-income countries (LMICs).

ObjectivesWe estimated the association between patients characteristics and COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization and adverse outcome in Mexico.

MethodsThis retrospective case series used a publicly available nation-level dataset released on May 31, 2020 by the Mexican Ministry of Health, with patients classified as suspected cases of viral respiratory disease. Patients with COVID-19 were laboratory-confirmed. Their profile was stratified by COVID-19 diagnosis or not. Differences among COVID-19 patients based on two separate clinical endpoints, hospitalization and adverse outcome, were examined. Multivariate logistic regressions examined the associations between patient characteristics and hospitalization and adverse outcome.

ResultsOverall, 236,439 patients were included, with 89,756 (38.0%) being diagnosed with COVID-19. COVID-19 patients were disproportionately older, males and with increased prevalence of one or more comorbidities, particularly diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Age, male gender, diabetes, obesity and having one or more comorbidities were independently associated with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Current smokers were 23% less likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to non-smokers. Of all COVID-19 patients, 34.8% were hospitalized and 13.0% experienced an adverse outcome. Male gender, older age, having one or more comorbidities, and chronic renal disease, diabetes, obesity, COPD, immunosuppression and hypertension were associated with hospitalization and adverse outcome. Current smoking was not associated with adverse outcome.

ConclusionThis largest ever case series of COVID-19 patients identified risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization and adverse outcome.

14353,Analyzing inherent biases in SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serological epidemiologic metrics,"BackgroundProspective observational data show that infected persons with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for a prolonged duration, and that detectable antibodies develop slowly with time. We aimed to analyze how these effects can bias key epidemiological metrics used to track and monitor SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.

MethodsAn age-structured mathematical model was constructed to simulate progression of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in populations. PCR testing to diagnose infection and cross-sectional surveys to measure seroprevalence were also simulated. Analyses were conducted on simulated outcomes assuming a natural epidemic time course and an epidemic in presence of interventions.

ResultsThe prolonged PCR positivity biased the epidemiological measures. There was a lag of 10 days between the true epidemic peak and the actually-observed peak. Prior to epidemic peak, PCR positivity rate was 2-fold higher than that based only on current active infection, and half of those tested positive by PCR were in the prolonged PCR positivity stage after infection clearance. Post epidemic peak, PCR positivity rate poorly predicted true trend in active infection. Meanwhile, the prolonged PCR positivity did not appreciably bias estimation of the basic reproduction number R0. The time delay in development of detectable antibodies biased measured seroprevalence. The actually-observed seroprevalence substantially underestimated true prevalence of ever infection, with the underestimation being most pronounced around epidemic peak.

ConclusionsCaution is warranted in interpreting PCR and serological testing data, and any drawn inferences need to factor the effects of the investigated biases for an accurate assessment of epidemic dynamics.","Makhoul, M.; Abou-Hijleh, F.; Seedat, S.; Mumtaz, G.

20637,Outbreak or pseudo-outbreak? Integrating SARS-CoV-2 sequencing to validate infection control practices in an end stage renal disease facility,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 poses a particularly high risk for End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients and led to a need for facility-wide control plans to prevent introduction and spread of infection within ESRD facilities. Rapid identification of clusters of contemporaneous cases is essential, as these may be indicative of within-facility spread. Nevertheless, in a setting of high community COVID-19 prevalence, a series of ESRD patients may test positive at around the same time without their shared ESRD facility being the nexus for disease spread. Here we describe a series of five cases occurring within an eleven-day period in November 2020 in a hospital-based 32-station ESRD facility in southwest Wisconsin, the subsequent facility-wide testing, and the use of genetic sequence analysis of positive specimens to evaluate whether these cases were linked.

MethodsFour patient cases and one staff case were identified in symptomatic individuals by RT-PCR. Facility-wide screening was initiated at the request of local public health and conducted using Abbot BinaxNOW antigen tests. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were obtained from residual diagnostic test specimens using an amplicon-based approach on an Ion Torrent S5 sequencer.

ResultsResidual specimens from 4 of 5 cases were available for sequence analysis. Each sequence was very clearly genetically distinct from the others, indicating that these contemporaneous cases were not linked. Facility-wide screening of 47 staff and 107 patients did not identify any additional cases.

ConclusionsThese data indicate that despite the outward appearance of a case cluster, the facility did not experience within-facility spread nor serve as the epicenter of a new outbreak, suggesting that the enacted rigorous infection control procedures (screening, masking, distancing) practiced stringently by patients and staff were sufficient to permit dialysis to proceed safely in a very high-risk population under pressure from increasing community spread. These data also demonstrate the utility of rapid turnaround SARS-CoV-2 sequencing in outbreak investigations in settings like ESRD facilities.","Pfaff, B. L.; Richmond, C. S.; Sabin, A. P.; Athas, D.

10386,A Randomised Trial of Covid-19 Transmission in Training Facilities,"BackgroundMost countries closed training facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. This may have negative consequences for peoples health and wellbeing. We investigated SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission and COVID-19 disease attributable to training facilities.

MethodsWe randomized members 18 to 64 years with no COVID-19 relevant comorbidities randomized Five training facilities in Oslo, Norway to access or no access to their training facility. Facilities were opened from May 22, 2020 for individuals randomized to training, applying increased social distancing (1 meter for floor exercise, 2 meters for high-intensity classes), enhanced hand and surface hygiene. Locker rooms were open, showers and saunas were closed. We measured SARS-CoV-2 PCR status by self-administered naso-, oropharyngeal and sputum sampling after two weeks and clinical disease by linkage to electronic patient records after three weeks.

Results3,764 individuals were randomized and included in analyses; 1,896 in the training and 1,868 in no-training arms. In the training arm, 81.8% trained at least once at the facilities, and 38.5% trained [&ge;]six times. Out of 3,016 individuals who returned the SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests (80.5%), there was one positive test. The positive individual was randomized to training, but had not used the facility before testing day. Contact tracing revealed the workplace as transmission source. A total of 106 individuals (2.8%) had outpatient hospital visits, and six individuals were admitted to hospital during the three weeks after intervention start, with no differences between arms. There were no outpatient visits or hospital admissions due to COVID-19 in either group.

ConclusionsProvided good hygiene and social distancing measures, there was no increased COVID-19 spread at training facilities.

13511,"To what extent physical distancing and other COVID-19 preventive measures being implemented among people in Arba Minch town, Southern Ethiopia: exploring evidence for an urgent call for action?","BackgroundThe number of confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases surge substantially in resource-poor settings within the fragile health system. Since there are no proven vaccine and treatment in place against the disease, controlling strategy mainly rely on preventive measures. However, data on the extent of implementing physical distancing and other preventive measures were under estimated. This study, therefore, investigated these gaps among people in Arba Minch town, southern Ethiopia.

MethodsWe conducted a community based cross-sectional study in Arba Minch town; from 15-30 June 2020. Data were collected using interviewer administered questionnaire and checklist. Then, data were cleaned, coded and entered to EpiData version 4.4.2, and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis.

ResultsOf the total participants (459), 43.6% achieved above the mean score (6{+/-}1.97) on preventive measures of COVID-19. Only 29.8% of participants kept the recommended physical distance, and surprisingly, in all public gathering places the distance was not kept totally. In addition, of the total participants, only 37.7% had face-mask use practice; 20.5% had hand sanitizer use practice, and 13.1% were measuring their body temperature every two weeks. Moreover, 42.5% of participants avoided attendance in public gatherings; 44.7% stopped touching their nose, eye and mouth; 55.6% practiced stay-at-home; and 60% had frequent hand washing practice. Majority of participants (66.7%) practiced covering their mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing; 68.2% had treatment seeking behavior if they experience flue like symptoms; 69.1% practiced isolating themselves while having flue like symptoms; and 89.3% avoided hand shaking.

ConclusionsThe findings of this study suggest that physical distancing and other COVID-19 preventive measures were inadequately implemented among people in Arba Minch town. Thus, an urgent call for action is demanding to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 as early as possible before it brings a devastating impact.","Asfaw, M.

27298,"The impact of three progressively introduced interventions on second wave daily COVID-19 case numbers in Melbourne, Australia","BackgroundThe city of Melbourne, Australia experienced two waves of the COVID-19 epidemic peaking, the first in March and a more substantial wave in July 2020. During the second wave, a series of control measure were progressively introduced that initially slowed the growth of the epidemic then resulted in decreasing cases until there was no detectable local transmission.

MethodsTo determine the relative efficacy of the progressively introduced intervention measures, we modelled the second wave as a series of exponential growth and decay curves. We used a linear regression of the log of daily cases vs time, using a four-segment linear spline model corresponding to implementation of the three successive major public health measures. The primary model used all reported cases between 14 June and 15 September then compared the projection of the model with observed cases predict future case trajectory up until the 31 October to assess the use of exponential models in projecting the future course and planning future interventions. The main outcome measures were the exponential daily growth constants, analysis of residuals and estimates of the 95% confidence intervals for the expected case distributions, comparison of predicted daily cases.

ResultsThe exponential growth/decay constants in the primary analysis were: 0.122 (s.e. 0.004), 0.035 (s.e. 0.005), -0.037 (s.e. 0.011), and -0.069 (s.e. 0.003) for the initial growth rate, Stage 3, stage 3 + compulsory masks and Stage 4, respectively. Extrapolation of the regression model from the 14 September to the 31 October matched the decline in observed cases over this period.

ConclusionsThe four-segment exponential model provided an excellent fit of the observed reported case data and predicted the day-to-day range of expected cases. The extrapolated regression accurately predicted the decline leading to epidemic control in Melbourne.","Saul, A. J.; Scott, N.; Spelman, T.; Crabb, B.

2091,Case fatality rate of novel coronavirus disease 2019 in China,"BackgroundA pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which have caused more than 80 thousand persons infected globally is still ongoing. This study aims to calculate its case fatality rate (CFR).

MethodsThe method, termed as converged CFR calculation, was based on the formula of dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases T days before, where T was an average time period from case confirmation to death. It was found that supposing a T, if it was smaller (bigger) than the true T, calculated CFRs would gradually increase (decrease) to infinitely near the true T with time went on. According to the law, the true T value could be determined by trends of daily CFRs calculated with different assumed T values (left of true T is decreasing, right is increasing). Then the CFR could be calculated.

ResultsCFR of COVID-19 in China except Hubei Province was 0.8% to 0.9%. So far, the CFR had accurately predicted the death numbers more than 3 weeks. CFR in Hubei of China was 5.4% by which the calculated death number corresponded with the reported number for 2 weeks.

ConclusionThe method could be used for CFR calculating while pandemics are still ongoing. Dynamic monitoring of the daily CFRs trends could help outbreak-controller to have a clear vision in the timeliness of the case confirmation.","Qi, R.; Ye, C.; Qin, X.-R.; Yu, X.-J.",2020-03-03,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.02.26.20028076,2,Xue-Jie Yu,"Wuhan University School of Health Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028076v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028076v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
15884,"Strong impact of closing schools, closing bars and wearing masks during the Covid-19 pandemic: results from a simple and revealing analysis","Many complex mathematical and epidemiological methods have been used to model the Covid-19 pandemic. We took a different approach. Making no assumptions, we simply plotted cases, hospitalizations and deaths, on a log2 Y axis and a linear date-based X axis, and analyzed them using segmented regression. The data fit straight lines with correlation coefficients ranging from 92% - 99%, and these lines broke at interesting intervals, revealing that school closings dropped infection rates in half, lockdowns dropped the rates 3 to 4 fold, and other actions (such as closing bars and mandating masks) brought the rates even further down. Hospitalizations and deaths lagged, but paralleled cases. The graphs, which are easy to read, have several implications for modeling and policy development during this and future pandemics. Overall three interventions had the most impact: closing schools, closing bars and wearing masks: a message easily understood by the public.

18599,IMPACT OF THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 PANDEMIC ON SURGICAL VOLUME IN JAPAN: A COHORT STUDY USING ADMINISTRATIVE DATA,"BackgroundInternationally, the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused unprecedented challenges for surgical staff to minimise the exposure to COVID-19 or save medical resources without harmful outcomes for patients, in accordance with the statement of each surgical society. However, no research has empirically validated declines in Japanese surgical volume or compared decrease rates of surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Material and MethodsWe extracted 672,772 available cases of patients aged > 15 years who were discharged between July 1, 2018, and June 30, 2020. After categorisation of surgery, we calculated descriptive statistics to compare the year-over-year trend and conducted interrupted time series analysis to validate the decline.

ResultsThe year-over-year trend of all eight surgical categories decreased from April 2020 and reached a minimum in May 2020 (May: abdominal, 68.4%; thoracic, 85.8%; genitourinary, 78.6%; cardiovascular, 90.8%; neurosurgical, 69.1%; orthopaedic, 62.4%; ophthalmologic, 52.0%; ear/nose/throat, 27.3%). Interrupted time series analysis showed no significant trends in oncological and critical benign surgeries.

ConclusionWe demonstrated and validated a trend of reduction in surgical volume in Japan using administrative data applying interrupted time series analyses.

10861,Community vulnerability to epidemics in Nepal: A high-resolution spatial assessment amidst COVID-19 pandemic,"The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), the biggest health problem at present, doesnt have uniform transmission and severity among the countries and communities therein. Knowledge of community vulnerability to the disease would facilitate interventions aimed at transmission control by the efficient deployment of available limited resources. Therefore, we assessed spatial variations and heterogeneity of disease vulnerability among the population in 753 municipal units of Nepal. We collected geospatial indicators representing the domain of socioeconomic inequalities, population dynamics, heterogeneity in accessibility and the information related to underlying health condition which potentially affect the severity of COVID-19 transmission. Those indicators were assembled to create three vulnerability indices using Geographic Information System (GIS); Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), Epidemiological Vulnerability Index (EVI) and a composite of the two- Social and Epidemiological Vulnerability Index (SEVI). The indicators were scaled to a common measurement scale and spatially overlaid via equally weighted arithmetic mean. The indices were classified into five level of risk and the municipal units and the population within vulnerabilities classes were quantified and visualized in the map. The index output indicated high vulnerability to epidemics in megacities like Kathmandu, Pokhara, Bharatpur, etc.; developing cities especially in the Province No 2; and, municipal units of Karnali and Sudoorpashchim provinces. Additionally, some other municipalities such as Dhulikhel, Beshishahar, Tansen etc. which have a higher prevalence of pulmonary and cardiovascular disorders are highly vulnerable. The SVI indicated that 174 municipal units and 41.5% population is highly vulnerable. The EVI identified 55 municipal units and 40.7% of the total population of the country highly vulnerable to COVID-19. The SEVI accounted that disease vulnerability is high in 105 municipal units and 40% population of Nepal. The vulnerability indices created are means for different tiers of the existing government in federal system of Nepal for prioritization and improved planning for disease intervention especially in highly vulnerable municipal units where the COVID-19 transmission could have high severity.","Khanal, L.; Paudel, B.

First, the significant variation of the canonical immune-responsive signals of both humoral and cellular immunity, as well as other possible symptom-driver signals were evaluated in the specific cell types. Second, we described and compared the common and distinct variation trends across COVID-19 vaccination, disease progression, and flu vaccination to achieve in-depth understandings of the manifestation of immune response in peripheral blood under different stimuli. Third, the expanded T cell and B cell clones were correlated to the specific phenotypes which allowed us to characterize the antigen-specific ones much easier in the future.

7646,Serologic responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection among hospital staff with mild disease in eastern France,"BackgroundThe serologic response of individuals with mild forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection is poorly characterized.

MethodsHospital staff who had recovered from mild forms of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two assays: a rapid immunodiagnostic test (99.4% specificity) and the S-Flow assay ([~]99% specificity).The neutralizing activity of the sera was tested with a pseudovirus-based assay.

ResultsOf 162 hospital staff who participated in the investigation, 160 reported SARS-CoV-2 infection that had not required hospital admission and were included in these analyses. The median time from symptom onset to blood sample collection was 24 days (IQR: 21-28, range 13-39). The rapid immunodiagnostic test detected antibodies in 153 (95.6%) of the samples and the S-Flow assay in 159 (99.4%), failing to detect antibodies in one sample collected 18 days after symptom onset (the rapid test did not detect antibodies in that patient). Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were detected in 79%, 92% and 98% of samples collected 13-20, 21-27 and 28-41 days after symptom onset, respectively (P=0.02).

ConclusionAntibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in virtually all hospital staff sampled from 13 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. This finding supports the use of serologic testing for the diagnosis of individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The neutralizing activity of the antibodies increased overtime. Future studies will help assess the persistence of the humoral response and its associated neutralization capacity in recovered patients.","Fafi-Kremer, S.; Bruel, T.; Madec, Y.; Grant, R.; Tondeur, L.; Grzelak, L.; Staropoli, I.; Anna, F.; Souque, P.; Mutter, C.; Collongues, N.; Bolle, A.; Velay, A.; Lefebvre, N.; Mielcarek, M.; Meyer, N.; Rey, D.; Charneau, P.; Hoen, B.; De Seze, J.; Schwartz, O.; Fontanet, A.",2020-05-22,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.19.20101832,2,Samira Fafi-Kremer,CHRU Strasbourg,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20101832v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20101832v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.102915

The performance of the controls is measured through a cost functional involving vaccination and lockdown costs as well as the burden of COVID19 quantified in DALYs. We calibrate parameters with data from Mexico City and Valle de Mexico. By using differential evolution, we minimize the cost functional subject to the controlled system and find optimal policies that are constant in time intervals of a given size. The main advantage of these policies relies on its practical implementation since the health authority has to make only a finite number of different decisions. Our methodology to find optimal policies is relatively general, allowing changes in the dynamics, the cost functional, or the frequency the policymaker changes actions.","Salcedo-Varea, G.

25776,"Reopen or redistribute? Modeling years of life lost due to Covid-19, socioeconomic status, and non-pharmaceutical interventions","Research in the current pandemic has put a sharp focus on the health burden of Covid-19, thereby largely neglecting the cost to life from the socioeconomic consequences of its containment. The paper develops a model for assessing their proportionality. It compares the years of life lost (YLL) due to Covid-19 and the socioeconomic consequences of its containment. The model reconciles the normative life table approach with de facto socioeconomic realities by correcting YLL estimates for socioeconomic differences in life expectancy. It thereby aims to improve on the attribution of YLL due to immediate and fundamental sources of inequalities in life expectancy. The application of the approach to the pandemic suggests that the socioeconomic consequences of containment measures potentially come with a much higher life tag than the disease itself and therefore need urgent attention, especially in poorer and more unequal societies. Avoiding 3 million additional cases of extreme poverty may come with a similar life tag as protecting 1 million people from dying from Covid-19.","John, J.",2021-05-03,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.04.23.21256005,2,Jari John,University of Heidelberg,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.23.21256005v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.23.21256005v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG antibodies in the cohort of asymptomatic and SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative professional football players in the Croatian First Football League by using a commercial ELISA antibody assay in the paired serum samples taken 2 months apart.

MethodsSerology testing was performed from May till July 2020 in a cohort of 305 asymptomatic football players and club staff members. RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs was performed on three occasions, and Euroimmun ELISA for detection of IgA and IgG (S1 and NCP) antibodies was tested in paired serum samples in May and July.

ResultsAll RT-PCR results were negative. Sixty-one (20%) participants were reactive in one or two classes of antibodies at baseline and/or follow-up serology testing. IgA reactivity was found in 41 (13.4% [95% CI=10.7-17.7]) baseline sera and 42 (13.8% [95% CI=10.3-18.9]) follow-up sera. IgG to S1 protein was found in 6 (2% [95% CI=0.9-4.2]) participants at baseline and 1 (0.33% [95% CI=0.0006-1.83]) at follow-up. IgG to NCP was found in 2 (0.7% [95% CI=0.2-2.4]) participants at baseline and 8 (2.6% (95% CI=1.3-5.1]) participants at follow-up. Noticeable dynamics in the paired sera was observed in 18 (5.9%) participants (excluding borderline IgA results) or 32 (10.5%) (including IgA borderline results).

ConclusionVarious patterns of IgA and IgG reactivity were found in the paired serum samples.

Relevant data were extracted and analysed by narrative synthesis. Our results included six studies in the review of which four studies were of good or fair quality. All eligible studies included were for coronavirus involving the use of either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to treat common symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue. Outcomes most commonly reported were improved lung function, viral clearance, and hospital discharge. Strong evidence to support the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 is lacking.

MethodsThe R0 of COVID-19 was estimated using the serial interval distribution and the number of incidence cases. The serial interval was fit with a gamma distribution. The probable incidence and cumulative incidence in the next 30 days were predicted using the assumption that daily incidence follows a Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. Data analysis was done using """"earlyR"""" and """"projections"""" packages in R software.

ResultsThe maximum-likelihood value of R0 was 2.7 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1 to 3.4) for the COVID-19 epidemic in the early 14 days and decreased to 1.13 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.25) by the end of the day 41. The expected average number of new cases in Shahroud is 9.0{+/-}3.8 case/day, which means an estimated total of 271 (95% CI: 178-383) new cases in the next 30 days.

ConclusionsIt is essential to reduce the R0 to values below one. Therefore, we strongly recommend enforcing and continuing the current preventive measures, restricting travel, and providing screening tests for a larger proportion of the population.","Khosravi, A.; Chaman, R.; Rohani-Rasaf, M.; Zare, F.; Mehravaran, S.; Emamian, M.

23144,Modeling COVID-19 Nonpharmaceutical Interventions: Exploring periodic NPI strategies,"In April 2020, we developed a COVID-19 transmission model used as part of RANDs web-based COVID-19 decision support tool that compares the effects of different nonphar-maceutical public health interventions (NPIs) on health and economic outcomes. An interdis-ciplinary approach informed the selection and use of multiple NPIs, combining quantitative modeling of the health/economic impacts of interventions with qualitative assessments of other important considerations (e.g., cost, ease of implementation, equity). We previously published a description of our approach as a RAND report describing how the epidemiological model, the economic model, and a systematic assessment of NPIs informed the web-tool. This paper provides further details of our model, describes extensions that we made to our model since April, presents sensitivity analyses, and analyzes periodic NPIs. Our findings suggest that there are opportunities to shape the tradeoffs between economic and health outcomes by carefully evaluating a more comprehensive range of reopening policies. We consider strategies that periodically switch between a base NPI level and a higher NPI level as our working example.","Vardavas, R.; Nascimento De Lima, P.; Baker, L.",2021-03-21,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.02.28.21252642,2,Raffaele Vardavas,RAND Corporation,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.28.21252642v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.28.21252642v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
26374,Intra-host evolution provides for continuous emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants,"Variants of concern (VOC) in SARS-CoV-2 refer to viral genomes that differ significantly from the ancestor virus and that show the potential for higher transmissibility and/or worse clinical progression. VOC have the potential to disrupt ongoing public health measures and vaccine efforts. Yet, little is known regarding how frequently different viral variants emerge and under what circumstances. We report a longitudinal study to determine the degree of SARS-CoV-2 sequence evolution in 94 COVID-19 cases and to estimate the frequency at which highly diverse variants emerge. 2 cases accumulated [&ge;]9 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) over a two-week period and 1 case accumulated 23 SNVs over a three-week period, including three non-synonymous mutations in the Spike protein (D138H, E554D, D614G). We estimate that in 2% of COVID cases, viral variants with multiple mutations, including in the Spike glycoprotein, can become the dominant strains in as little as one month of persistent in patient virus replication. This suggests the continued local emergence of VOC independent of travel patterns. Surveillance by sequencing for (i) viremic COVID-19 patients, (ii) patients suspected of re-infection, and (iii) patients with diminished immune function may offer broad public health benefits.","Landis, J.; Moorad, R.; Pluta, L.

23203,The Risks and Benefits of Providing HIV Services during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread disruptions including to health services. In the early response to the pandemic many countries restricted population movements and some health services were suspended or limited. In late 2020 and early 2021 some countries re-imposed restrictions. Health authorities need to balance the potential harms of additional SARS-CoV-2 transmission due to contacts associated with health services against the benefits of those services, including fewer new HIV infections and deaths. This paper examines these trade-offs for select HIV services.

MethodsWe used four HIV simulation models (Goals, HIV Synthesis, Optima HIV and EMOD) to estimate the benefits of continuing HIV services in terms of fewer new HIV infections and deaths. We used three COVID-19 transmission models (Covasim, Cooper/Smith and a simple contact model) to estimate the additional deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 transmission among health workers and clients. We examined four HIV services: voluntary medical male circumcision, HIV diagnostic testing, viral load testing and programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission. We compared COVID-19 deaths in 2020 and 2021 with HIV deaths occurring now and over the next 50 years discounted to present value. The models were applied to countries with a range of HIV and COVID-19 epidemics.

ResultsMaintaining these HIV services could lead to additional COVID-19 deaths of 0.002 to 0.15 per 10,000 clients. HIV-related deaths averted are estimated to be much larger, 19 - 146 discounted deaths per 10,000 clients.

DiscussionWhile there is some additional short-term risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with providing HIV services, the risk of additional COVID-19 deaths is at least 100 times less than the HIV deaths averted by those services. Ministries of Health need to take into account many factors in deciding when and how to offer essential health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. This work shows that the benefits of continuing key HIV services are far larger than the risks of additional SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Stover, J.; Kelly, S.

4518,Using ICU data to improve the real-time estimation of the effective reproductive number of the COVID-19 epidemic in 9 European countries,"1.We replicate a recent study by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team (Flaxman et al, 2020) that estimates both the effective reproductive number, Rt, of the current COVID-19 epidemic in 11 European countries, and the impact of different nonpharmaceutical interventions that have been implemented to try to contain the epidemic, including case isolation, the closure of schools and universities, banning of mass gatherings and/or public events, and most recently, widescale social distancing including local and national lockdowns. The main indicator they use for measuring the evolution of the epidemic is the daily number of deaths by COVID-19 in each country, which is a better statistic than the number of identified cases because it doesnt depend so much on the testing strategy that is in place in each country at each moment in time.

We improve on their estimation by using data from the number of patients in intensive care, which provides two advantages over the number of deaths: first, it can be used to construct a signal with less bias: as the healthcare system of a country reaches saturation, the mortality rate would be expected to increase, which would bias the estimates of Rt and of the impact of measures implemented to contain the epidemic; and second, it is a signal with less lag, as the time from onset of symptoms to ICU admission is shorter than the time from onset to death (on average, 7.5 days shorter). The intensive care signal we use is not just the number of people in ICU, as this would also be biased if the healthcare system has reached saturation (in this case, biased downwards, as admissions are no longer possible when all units are in use). Instead, we estimate the daily demand of intensive care, as the sum of two components: the part that is satisfied (new ICU admissions) and the part that is not (which results in excess mortality).

Thanks to the advantages of this ICU signal in terms of timeliness and bias, we find that most of the countries in the study have already reached Rt<1 with 95% confidence (Italy, Spain, Austria, Denmark, France, Norway and Switzerland, but not Belgium or Sweden), whereas the original methodology of Flaxman et al (2020), even with updated data, would only find Rt<1 with 95% confidence for Italy and Switzerland.","Hurtado, S.; Tinajero, D.",2020-04-17,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.13.20063388,1,Samuel Hurtado,"NA",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063388v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063388v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
22360,"Noncommunicable Diseases, Sociodemographic Vulnerability, and the Risk of Mortality in Hospitalized Children and Adolescents with COVID-19 in Brazil: A Syndemic in Play","BackgroundAlthough many studies identify the presence of comorbidities and socioeconomic vulnerabilities as risk factors for worse COVID-19 outcomes, few have addressed this issue in children. We aimed to study how these factors have impacted COVID-19 mortality in Brazilian children and adolescents.

MethodsThis is an observational study using publicly available data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health. We studied 5,857 patients younger than 20 years old, all of them hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We used multilevel mixed-effects generalized linear models to study mortality, stratifying the analysis by age, region of the country, presence of noncommunicable diseases, ethnicity, and socioeconomic development.

FindingsIndividually, most of the comorbidities included were risk factors. Having more than one comorbidity increased almost tenfold the risk of death (OR 9{middle dot}67 95%CI 6{middle dot}89-13{middle dot}57). Compared to White children, Indigenous, Pardo (mixed), and East Asian had a significantly higher risk of mortality. We also found a regional effect (higher mortality in the North), and a socioeconomic effect (higher mortality among children from less socioeconomically developed municipalities).

InterpretationBesides the impact of comorbidities, we identified ethnic, regional, and socioeconomic effects shaping the mortality of children hospitalized with COVID-19 in Brazil. Putting these findings together, we propose that there is a syndemic among COVID-19 and noncommunicable diseases, driven and fostered by large-scale sociodemographic inequalities. Facing COVID-19 in Brazil must also include addressing these structural issues. Our findings also identify risk groups among children that should be prioritized for public health measures, such as vaccination.

4927,Multivariate Analysis of Factors Affecting COVID-19 Case and Death Rate in U.S. Counties: The Significant Effects of Black Race and Temperature,"ObjectivesCoronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly around the world, and many risk factors including patient demographics, social determinants of health, environmental variables, underlying health conditions, and adherence to social distancing have been hypothesized to affect case and death rates. However, little has been done to account for the potential confounding effects of these factors. Using a large multivariate analysis, this study illuminates modulators of COVID-19 incidence and mortality in U.S. counties while controlling for risk factors across multiple domains.

MethodsData on COVID-19 and various risk factors in all U.S. counties was collected from publicly available data sources through April 14, 2020. Counties with at least 50 COVID-19 cases were included in case analyses and those with at least 10 deaths were included in mortality models. The 661 counties meeting inclusion criteria for number of cases were grouped into quartiles and comparisons of risk factors were made using t-tests between the highest and lowest quartiles. Similar comparisons for 217 counties were made for above average and below average deaths/100,000. Adjusted linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the independent effects of factors that significantly impacted cases and deaths.

ResultsUnivariate analyses demonstrated numerous significant differences between cohorts for both cases and deaths. Risk factors associated with increased cases and/or deaths per 100,000 included increased GDP per capita, decreased social distancing, increased age, increased percent Black, decreased percent Hispanic, decreased percent Asian, decreased health, increased poverty, increased diabetes, increased coronary heart disease, increased physical inactivity, increased alcohol consumption, increased tobacco use, and decreased access to primary care. Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated Black race is a risk factor for worse COVID-19 outcome independent of comorbidities, poverty, access to health care, and other mitigating factors. Lower daily temperatures was also an independent risk factor in case load but not deaths.

ConclusionsU.S. counties with a higher proportion of Black residents are associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. However, the various suggested mechanisms, such as socioeconomic and healthcare predispositions, did not appear to drive the effect of race in our model. Counties with higher average daily temperatures are also associated with decreased COVID-19 cases but not deaths. Several theories are posited to explain these findings, including prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Additional studies are needed to further understand these effects.","Li, A. Y.; Hannah, T.

25624,Modelling to inform the COVID-19 response in Bangladesh,"BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) used to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission vary in their feasibility, appropriateness and effectiveness in different contexts. In Bangladesh a national lockdown implemented in March 2020 exacerbated poverty and was untenable long-term, and a resurgence in 2021 warranted renewed NPIs.

MethodsWe developed an SEIR model for Dhaka District, parameterised from literature values and calibrated to data from Bangladesh. We discussed scenarios and parameterisations with policymakers with the aid of an interactive app. These discussions guided modelling of lockdown and two post-lockdown measures considered feasible to deliver; symptoms-based household quarantining and compulsory mask-wearing. We examined how testing capacity affects case detection, and compared NPI scenarios on deaths, hospitalisations relative to capacity, working days lost, and cost-effectiveness.

ResultsLockdowns alone were predicted to delay the first epidemic peak but could not prevent overwhelming of the health service and were costly in lost working days. Impacts of post-lockdown interventions depended heavily on compliance. Assuming 80% compliance, symptoms-based household quarantining alone could not prevent hospitalisations exceeding capacity, whilst mask-wearing prevented overwhelming health services and was cost-effective given masks of high filtration efficiency. Combining masks with quarantine increased their impact. Even at maximum testing capacity, confirmed cases far underestimate total cases. Recalibration to surging cases in 2021 suggests potential for another wave later in 2021, dependent on uncertainties in case reporting and immunity.

ConclusionsMasks and symptoms-based household quarantining synergistically prevent transmission, and are cost-effective in Bangladesh. Our interactive app was valuable in supporting decision-making, with mask-wearing being mandated early, and community teams being deployed to support quarantining across Dhaka. These measures likely contributed to averting the worst public health impacts, but delivering an effective response at scale has been challenging. Messaging to increase compliance with mask-wearing and quarantine is needed to reduce the risk and impacts from another wave.","Ferguson, E.

12270,LUNG ULTRASOUND FINDINGS IN MEXICAN PATIENTS WITH SARS COV2 INFECTION,"In late December 2019, a new disease reported at the time by an unknown pathogen was reported, which was later found to be a new variant of coronavirus, now called SARS-CoV2. This new disease had a very rapid global spread, causing multiple deaths in a short time, and which led to putting the entire world on health alert. In patients who have this disease, they present bilateral opacities in frosted multilobar glass with peripheral distribution. Some authors have suggested the use of ultrasound at the point of care for its early recognition.

In this study, we evaluated the findings of lung ultrasound in 25 patients admitted to the General Hospital Dr. Enrique Cabrera, Mexico, with a diagnosis confirmed by RT-PCR of SARS CoV2. This small retrospective study suggests that artifacts like glass rockets with or without the Birolleau variant (White lung), confluent B-lines, thick irregular pleural lines, and variable size (subpleural) consolidations are typical findings of lung ultrasound in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The presence of these findings is useful when evaluating patients with suspected COVID-19. In resource-limited and austere settings where chest radiography, CT, and RT-PCR are not available or the response time is long, lung ultrasound performed by trained personnel can be an aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19.","Paredes, L.

15182,Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio on admission to predict the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients: a meta-analysis,"The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), an inflammatory marker, was suggested to be predictive of severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients, thus allowing early risk stratification. In this study, we investigated whether NLR levels on admission could predict the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients. A literature search was conducted on 23 July 2020 to retrieve all published articles, including grey literature and preprints, investigating the association between on-admission NLR values and severity or mortality in COVID-19 patients. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). A meta-analysis was performed to determine the overall standardized mean difference (SMD) in NLR values and the pooled risk ratio (RR) for severity and mortality with the 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI). Meta-regression analysis was done to identify potential confounders. A total of 38 articles, including 5699 patients with severity outcomes and 6033 patients with mortality outcomes, were included. The meta-analysis showed that severe and non-survivors of COVID-19 had higher on-admission NLR levels than non-severe and survivors (SMD 0.88; 95%CI 0.72-1.04; I2=75% and 1.68; 95%CI 0.98-2.39; I2=99%, respectively). Regardless of the different NLR cut-off values, the pooled mortality RR in patients with elevated vs. normal NLR levels was 2.75 (95%CI 0.97-7.72). Meta-regression analysis showed that the association between NLR levels on admission and COVID-19 severity and mortality was unaffected by age (p=0.236; p=0.213, respectively). High NLR levels on admission were associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality. Further studies need to focus on determining the optimal cut-off value for NLR before clinical use.

To determine the effect of two doses BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination schedule in individuals who recovered from COVID-19 (ex COVID-19) compared to naive subjects we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T and B cell responses, as well as specific IgG, IgM and neutralizing antibodies titres in 22 individuals who received BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, 11 of which had a previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evaluations were performed before vaccination and then weekly until 7 days post second injection. Data obtained clearly showed that one vaccine dose is sufficient to increase both cellular and humoral immune response in ex COVID-19 subjects without any additional improvement after the second dose. On the contrary, the second dose is mandatory in naive ones to further enhance the response. These results question whether a second vaccine jab in ex COVID-19 subjects is required and indicate that millions of vaccine doses may be redirected to naive individuals, thus shortening the time to reach herd immunity.","Mazzoni, A.; Di Lauria, N.; Maggi, L.; Salvati, L.; Vanni, A.; Capone, M.; Lamacchia, G.; Mantengoli, E.; Spinicci, M.; Zammarchi, L.; Kiros, S.

Here, we assessed the levels of SARS-CoV-2 RBD specific antibodies in twenty-seven COVID-19 convalescent patients over 28-99 days after hospital discharge. Almost all patient who had severe or moderate COVID-19 symptoms and a high-level of IgG during the hospitalization showed a significant reduction at revisit. The remaining patients who had a low-level IgG during hospitalization stayed low at revisit. As expected, IgM levels in almost all convalescent patients reduced significantly or stayed low at revisit. The RBD-specific IgA levels were also reduced significantly at revisit. We also attempted to estimate decline rates of virus-specific antibodies using a previously established exponential decay model of antibody kinetics after infection. The predicted days when convalescent patients RBD-specific IgG reaches to an undetectable level are approximately 273 days after hospital discharge, while the predicted decay times are 150 days and 108 days for IgM and IgA, respectively.

3025,A Simple Mathematical Model for Estimating the Inflection Points of COVID-19 Outbreaks,"BackgroundExponential-like infection growths leading to peaks (which could be the inflection points or turning points) are usually the hallmarks of infectious disease outbreaks including coronaviruses. To predict the inflection points, i.e., inflection time (Tmax) & maximal infection number (Imax) of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), we adopted a trial and error strategy and explored a series of approaches from simple logistic modeling (that has an asymptomatic line) to sophisticated tipping point detection techniques for detecting phase transitions but failed to obtain satisfactory results.

MethodInspired by its success in diversity-time relationship (DTR), we apply the PLEC (power law with exponential cutoff) model for detecting the inflection points of COVID-19 outbreaks. The model was previously used to extend the classic species-time relationship (STR) for general DTR (Ma 2018), and it has two """"secondary"""" parameters (computed from its 3 parameters including power law scaling parameter w, taper-off parameter d to overwhelm virtually exponential growth ultimately, and a parameter c related to initial infections): one that was originally used for estimating the potential or  dark biodiversity is proposed to estimate the maximal infection number (Imax) and another is proposed to determine the corresponding inflection time point (Tmax).

ResultsWe successfully estimated the inflection points [Imax, Tmax] for most provinces ({approx}85%) in China with error rates <5% in both Imax and Tmax. We also discussed the constraints and limitations of the proposed approach, including (i) sensitive to disruptive jumps, (ii) requiring sufficiently long datasets, and (iii) limited to unimodal outbreaks.","Ma, Z.",2020-03-27,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.03.25.20043893,1,Zhanshan (Sam) Ma,Chinese Academy of Sciences,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043893v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043893v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
14520,Multiplexed Detection and Quantification of Human Antibody Response to COVID-19 Infection Using a Plasmon Enhanced Biosensor Platform,"The 2019 SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the need for rapid and accurate tests to diagnose acute infection and determine immune response to infection. In this work, a multiplexed grating-coupled fluorescent plasmonics (GC-FP) biosensing approach was shown to have 100% selectivity and sensitivity (n = 23) when measuring serum IgG levels against three COVID-19 antigens (spike S1, spike S1S2, and the nucleocapsid protein). The entire biosensing procedure takes less than 30 min, making it highly competitive with well-established ELISA and immunofluorescence assays. GC-FP is quantitative over a large dynamic range, providing a linear response for serum titers ranging from 1:25 to 1:1,600, and shows high correlation with both ELISA and a Luminex-based microsphere immunoassay (MIA) (Pearson r > 0.9). Compatibility testing with dried blood spot samples (n = 63) demonstrated 100% selectivity and 86.7% sensitivity. A machine learning (ML) model was trained to classify dried blood spot samples for prior COVID-19 infection status, based on the combined antibody response to S1, S1S2, and Nuc antigens. The ML model yielded 100% selectivity and 80% sensitivity and demonstrated a higher stringency than a single antibody-antigen response. The biosensor platform is flexible and will readily accommodate detection of multiple immunoglobulin isotypes. Further, it uses sub-nanogram quantities of capture ligand and is thus readily modified to include additional antigens, which is shown by the addition of RBD in later iterations of the test. The combination of rapid, multiplexed, and quantitative detection for both blood serum and dried blood spot samples makes GC-FP an attractive biosensor platform for COVID-19 antibody testing.","Cady, N.

10008,Efficacy and Safety of Lopinavir/Ritonavir for Treatment of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"BackgroundSince the emergence of COVID-19, the world has been desperate to find effective therapeutics and vaccinations to treat hundreds of thousands of affected patients and to suppress the spread of this global pandemic. Lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV/RTV) is an HIV antiviral combination that has been considered for treatment of this disease.

Aim of the studyThis systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir in COVID-19 patients in the extant published research. A systematic review protocol was developed based on PRISMA-P and the PRISMA statement. Published English and non-English articles written since December 1, 2019 were selected for review from 8 electronic databases.

Readily accessible full articles (cohort studies and clinical trials) which specifically mentioned lopinavir/ritonavir and patients with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 or COVOID-19 of any age were included. Three researchers separately evaluated the bias in the reported articles. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with the objective of evaluation of the safety and efficacy of LPV/RTV alone or in combination with other drugs with regard to time to becoming PCR negative, time to body temperature normalization and cough relief, radiological progression, and safety. Review Manager (RevMan) was used to conduct all statistical analyses and generate the forest plots. Meta-analyses were performed using the Mantel Hazel method or the inverse variance method for dichotomous data and continuous data respectively.

ResultsNon-duplicate articles (n=76) were evaluated for possible inclusion. A consensus was reached to select 29 articles for full-text screening, only 11 articles comprised 1,192 patients were included in this study, and six of which were included for meta-analysis.

In terms of virological cure (PCR negative), three studies reported less time in days to achieve a virological cure for LPV/RTV arm relative to no antiviral therapy (conventional) (mean difference = -0.81 day; 95% CI, -4.44 to 2.81; P = 0.007, I2 = 80%). However, the overall effect was not significant (P = 0.66). When comparing LPV/RTV arm to umifenovir arm, a favorable affect was observed for umifenovir arm, but not statically significant (mean difference = 0.95 day; 95% CI, -1.11 to 3.01; P = 0.09, I2 = 58%).

In terms of time to body normalization and cough relief (clinical cure), two studies reported on time to temperature normalization with no significant effect of LPV/RTV (n = 93) versus umifenovir (n = 71) arm), (OR = 0.87 day; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.78; (P = 0.70), I2 = 0%), or alleviation of cough duration (p = 0.69).

In terms of CT evidence of radiological progression of pneumonia/lung damage, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir resulted in no significant decrease in the radiological progression (OR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.54; P = 0.59, I2 = 81%), In terms of safety, a greater number of adverse events were reported for lopinavir/ritonavir (n=45) relative to the umifenovir arm (n=14) and conventional treatments (n=10), P = 0.004, 0,0007, respectively

ConclusionsThe small number of studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis study did not reveal any statistically significant advantage in efficacy of lopinavir-ritonavir in COVID-19 patients, over conventional or other antiviral treatments. This result might not reflect the actual evidence.","Tobaiqy, M.; Alhumaid, S.; Al Mutair, A.",2020-06-19,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.16.20133298,1,Mansour Tobaiqy,"Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of Jeddah, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.20133298v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.20133298v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3390/tropicalmed5040180
5038,"Improving Precision and Power in Randomized Trials for COVID-19 Treatments Using Covariate Adjustment, for Binary, Ordinal, and Time-to-Event Outcomes","SO_SCPLOWUMMARYC_SCPLOWTime is of the essence in evaluating potential drugs and biologics for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. There are currently over 400 clinical trials (phase 2 and 3) of treatments for COVID-19 registered on clinicaltrials.gov. Covariate adjustment is a statistical analysis method with potential to improve precision and reduce the required sample size for a substantial number of these trials. Though covariate adjustment is recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, it is underutilized, especially for the types of outcomes (binary, ordinal and time-to-event) that are common in COVID-19 trials. To demonstrate the potential value added by covariate adjustment in this context, we simulated two-arm, randomized trials comparing a hypothetical COVID-19 treatment versus standard of care, where the primary outcome is binary, ordinal, or time-to-event. Our simulated distributions are derived from two sources: longitudinal data on over 500 patients hospitalized at Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital, and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) preliminary description of 2449 cases. We found substantial precision gains from using covariate adjustment-equivalent to 9-21% reductions in the required sample size to achieve a desired power-for a variety of estimands (targets of inference) when the trial sample size was at least 200. We provide an R package and practical recommendations for implementing covariate adjustment. The estimators that we consider are robust to model misspecification.","Benkeser, D.; Diaz, I.; Luedtke, A.; Segal, J.; Scharfstein, D.; Rosenblum, M.",2020-06-11,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.19.20069922,2,Michael Rosenblum,"Department of Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.19.20069922v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.19.20069922v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1111/biom.13377
26554,Cardiovascular vulnerability predicts hospitalisation in primary care clinically suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients: a model development and validation study,"IntroductionCardiovascular disease and diabetes have shown to be predictive of clinical deterioration towards critical illness or death in the hospitalised COVID-19 patient population. The aim of this study was to determine the incremental value of cardiovascular vulnerability - defined by the number of cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes - in predicting the risk of escalation of care towards hospital referral in primary care patients with clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

MethodsData were retrospectively collected from three large Dutch primary care registries with routine care data of {+/-}850,000 people. A prognostic prediction model was developed in two databases to assess the incremental value of cardiovascular vulnerability. Data from the  first wave of COVID-19 infections in the Netherlands (March 1 2020 to June 1 2020) was used for derivation. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to predict hospital referral within 90 days follow-up after first consultation in consecutive adult patients seen in primary care for COVID-19 symptoms. Age, sex, the interaction between age and sex, and the number of underlying cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes (0, 1, or [&ge;]2) were pre-specified as predictors prior to the analyses. The model was (i) compared to a simpler model without the predictor number of cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes and (ii) externally validated in COVID-19 confirmed patients during the  second wave (June 1 2020 to April 15 2021) in all three databases.

ResultsThere were 5,475 patients included for model development and 6.8% had the primary outcome hospital referral. The model with number of cardiovascular diseases included as a predictor performed better than a model without this predictor (likelihood ratio test p<0.001). Older male patients with multiple cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes had the highest predicted risk of hospital referral, reaching risks above 15-20% in these patients. The model was externally validated in a population of 16,693 COVID-19 patients. The observed risk was lower in this temporal validation cohort (4.7% versus 6.8%). The temporally validated c-statistic was 0.747 (95%CI 0.729-0.764) and the model showed good calibration.

ConclusionIn this general population study, risk of clinical deterioration after suspected or confirmed COVID-19 was on average 5.1% in the development and validation cohorts combined. This risk increased with age and was higher in males compared to females. Importantly, patients with concurrent cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes had higher predicted risks. Identifying those at risk for hospital referral could have clinical implications for COVID-19 early disease management in primary care.","Van Royen, F. S.; Joosten, L.

22161,DrugWAS: Leveraging drug-wide association studies to facilitate drug repurposing for COVID-19,"ImportanceThere is an unprecedented need to rapidly identify safe and effective treatments for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

ObjectiveTo systematically investigate if any of the available drugs in Electronic Health Record (EHR), including prescription drugs and dietary supplements, can be repurposed as potential treatment for COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsBased on a retrospective cohort analysis of EHR data, drug-wide association studies (DrugWAS) were performed on COVID-19 patients at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). For each drug study, multivariable logistic regression with overlap weighting using propensity score was applied to estimate the effect of drug exposure on COVID-19 disease outcomes.

ExposuresPatient exposure to a drug during 1-year prior to the pandemic and COVID-19 diagnosis was chosen as exposure of interest. Natural language processing was employed to extract drug information from clinical notes, in addition to the prescription drug data available in structured format.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresAll-cause of death was selected as primary outcome. Hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and need for mechanical ventilation were identified as secondary outcomes.

ResultsThe study included 7,768 COVID-19 patients, of which 509 (6.55%) were hospitalized, 82 (1.06%) were admitted to ICU, 64 (0.82%) received mechanical ventilation, and 90 (1.16%) died. Overall, 15 drugs were significantly associated with decreased COVID-19 severity. Previous exposure to either Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccines (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.38; 95% CI, 0.14-0.98), diphtheria toxoid vaccine (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15-0.98), and tetanus toxoid vaccine (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15-0.98) were significantly associated with a decreased risk of death (primary outcome). Secondary analyses identified several other significant associations showing lower risk for COVID-19 outcomes: 2 vaccines (acellular pertussis, Streptococcus pneumoniae), 3 dietary supplements (turmeric extract, flaxseed extract, omega-3 fatty acids), methylprednisolone acetate, pseudoephedrine, ethinyl estradiol, estradiol, ibuprofen, and fluticasone.

Conclusions and RelevanceThis cohort study leveraged EHR data to identify a list of drugs that could be repurposed to improve COVID-19 outcomes. Further randomized clinical trials are needed to investigate the efficacy of the proposed drugs.

2086,Genomic variations of SARS-CoV-2 suggest multiple outbreak sources of transmission,"We examined 169 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and found that they can be classified into two major genotypes, Type I and Type II. Type I can be further divided into Type IA and IB. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that the Type IA resembles the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 most. Type II was likely evolved from Type I and predominant in the infections. Our results suggest that Type II SARS-CoV-2 was the source of the outbreak in the Wuhan Huanan market and it was likely originated from a super-spreader. The outbreak caused by the Type I virus should have occurred somewhere else, because the patients had no direct link to the market. Furthermore, by analyzing three genomic sites that distinguish Type I and Type II strains, we found that synonymous changes at two of the three sites confer higher protein translational efficiencies in Type II strains than in Type I strains, which might explain why Type II strains are predominant, implying that Type II is more contagious (transmissible) than Type I. These findings could be valuable for the current epidemic prevention and control.","Zhang, L.; Yang, J.-R.; Zhang, Z.; Lin, Z.",2020-03-05,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.02.25.20027953,2,Liangsheng Zhang,FAfu,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027953v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027953v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
2628,Highly accurate and sensitive diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2 by digital PCR,"BACKGROUNDThe outbreak of COVID-19 caused by a novel Coronavirus (termed SARS-CoV-2) has spread to over 140 countries around the world. Currently, reverse transcription quantitative qPCR (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2. However, the positive rate of RT-qPCR assay of pharyngeal swab samples are reported to vary from 30[~]60%. More accurate and sensitive methods are urgently needed to support the quality assurance of the RT-qPCR or as an alternative diagnostic approach.

METHODSWe established a reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2 on 194 clinical pharyngeal swab samples, including 103 suspected patients, 75 close contacts and 16 supposed convalescents.

RESULTSThe limit of blanks (LoBs) of the RT-dPCR assays were [~]1.6, [~]1.6 and [~]0.8 copies/reaction for ORF 1ab, N and E genes, respectively. The limit of detection (LoD) was 2 copies/reaction. For the 103 fever suspected patients, the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection was significantly improved from 28.2% by RT-qPCR to 87.4% by RT-dPCR. For close contacts, the suspect rate was greatly decreased from 21% down to 1%. The overall sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of RT-dPCR were 90%, 100% and 93 %, respectively. In addition, quantification of the viral load for convalescents by RT-dPCR showed that a longer observation period was needed in the hospital for elderly patients.

CONCLUSIONRT-dPCR could be a confirmatory method for suspected patients diagnosed by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, RT-dPCR was more sensitive and suitable for low viral load specimens from the both patients under isolation and those under observation who may not be exhibiting clinical symptoms.","Dong, L.; Zhou, J.; Niu, C.; Wang, Q.; Pan, Y.; Sheng, S.; Wang, X.; Zhang, Y.; Yang, J.; Liu, M.; Zhao, Y.; Zhang, X.; Zhu, T.; Peng, T.; Xie, J.; Gao, Y.; Wang, D.; Zhao, Y.; Dai, X.; Fang, X.",2020-03-30,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.03.14.20036129,2,Xinhua Dai,National institute of metrology China,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.14.20036129v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.14.20036129v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.talanta.2020.121726
18032,Balancing quarantine and self-distancing measures in adaptive epidemic networks,"We study the relative importance of two key control measures for epidemic spreading: endogenous social self-distancing and exogenous imposed quarantine. We use the framework of adaptive networks, moment-closure, and ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to introduce several novel models based upon susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) dynamics. First, we compare computationally expensive, adaptive network simulations with their corresponding computationally highly efficient ODE equivalents and find excellent agreement. Second, we discover that there exists a relatively simple critical curve in parameter space for the epidemic threshold, which strongly suggests that there is a mutual compensation effect between the two mitigation strategies: as long as social distancing and quarantine measures are both sufficiently strong, large outbreaks are prevented. Third, we study the total number of infected and the maximum peak during large outbreaks using a combination of analytical estimates and numerical simulations. Also for large outbreaks we find a similar compensation effect as for the epidemic threshold. This suggests that if there is little incentive for social distancing within a population, drastic quarantining is required, and vice versa. Both pure scenarios are unrealistic in practice. Our models show that only a combination of measures is likely to succeed to control epidemic spreading. Fourth, we analytically compute an upper bound for the total number of infected on adaptive networks, using integral estimates in combination with the moment-closure approximation on the level of an observable. This is a methodological innovation. Our method allows us to elegantly and quickly check and cross-validate various conjectures about the relevance of different network control measures. In this sense it becomes possible to adapt models rapidly to new epidemic challenges such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic.","Horstmeyer, L.; Kuehn, C.; Thurner, S.",2020-11-10,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.11.07.20227595,1,Leonhard Horstmeyer,Complexity Science Hub Vienna,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.07.20227595v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.07.20227595v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"

Plasmonic nanobubbles are transient vapor bubbles generated by laser heating of plasmonic nanoparticles and allow single-particle detection. Using gold nanoparticles labels and an optofluidic setup, we demonstrate that DIAMOND achieves a compartment-free digital counting and works on homogeneous assays without separation and amplification steps. When applied to the respiratory syncytial virus diagnostics, DIAMOND is 150 times more sensitive than commercial lateral flow assays and completes measurements within 2 minutes. Our method opens new possibilities to develop single-particle digital detection methods and facilitate rapid and ultrasensitive diagnostics.

Further, the rate of growth of infections in India is very close to that in Washington and California. Exponential and classic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models based on available data are used to make short and long-term predictions on a daily basis. Based on the SIR model, it is estimated that India will enter equilibrium by the end of May 2020 with the final epidemic size of approximately 13,000.

6930,Healthcare workers preparedness for COVID-19 pandemic in the occupied Palestinian territory: a cross-sectional survey,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens to overwhelm the capacity of the vulnerable healthcare system in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt). Sufficient training of healthcare workers (HCWs) in how to manage COVID-19 and the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) to enable them to do so will be key tools in allowing oPt to mount a credible response to the crisis.

MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted using a validated online questionnaire. Data collection occurred between March 30, 2020 and April 12, 2020. The primary outcomes were availability of PPE and HCWs preparedness in oPt for COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary outcome was the regional and hospital differences in oPt in terms of availability of PPE and HCWs preparedness.

ResultsOf 138 respondents, only 38 HCWs (27.5%) always had access to facemasks when needed and 15 (10.9%) for isolation gowns. The vast majority of HCWs did not find eye protection (n=128, 92.8%), N95 respirators (n=132, 95.7%), and face shields (n=127, 92%) always available. Compared to HCWs in West Bank, those in the Gaza Strip were significantly less likely to have access to alcohol sanitizers (p=0.026) and gloves (p <0.001). On average, governmental hospitals were significantly less likely to have all appropriate PPE measures than non-governmental institutions (p = 0.001). As for preparedness, only 16 (11.6%) surveyed felt confident in dealing with a potential COVID-19 case. With 57 (41.3%) having received any COVID-19 related training and 57 (41.3%) not having a local hospital protocol.

ConclusionHCWs in oPt are underprepared and severely lacking adequate PPE provision. The lack of local protocols, and training has left HCWs confidence exceedingly low. The lack of PPE provision will exacerbate spread of COVID-19 and deepen the crisis, whilst putting HCWs at risk.","Alser, O.; Alghoul, H.; Alkhateeb, Z.; Hamdan, A.; Albarqouni, L.; Saini, K.",2020-05-21,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.05.09.20096099,2,Osaid Alser,"Ministry of Health, Gaza, occupied Palestinian territory and OxPal Medlink, UK.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.09.20096099v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.09.20096099v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,"NA"
5430,Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil,"BackgroundThe first case of COVID-19 was detected in Brazil on February 25, 2020. We report the epidemiological, demographic, and clinical findings for confirmed COVID-19 cases during the first month of the epidemic in Brazil.

MethodsIndividual-level and aggregated COVID-19 data were analysed to investigate demographic profiles, socioeconomic drivers and age-sex structure of COVID-19 tested cases. Basic reproduction numbers (R0) were investigated for Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify symptoms associated with confirmed cases and risk factors associated with hospitalization. Laboratory diagnosis for eight respiratory viruses were obtained for 2,429 cases.

FindingsBy March 25, 1,468 confirmed cases were notified in Brazil, of whom 10% (147 of 1,468) were hospitalised. Of the cases acquired locally (77{middle dot}8%), two thirds (66{middle dot}9% of 5,746) were confirmed in private laboratories. Overall, positive association between higher per capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. The median age of detected cases was 39 years (IQR 30-53). The median R0 was 2{middle dot}9 for Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Cardiovascular disease/hypertension were associated with hospitalization. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses, including influenza A and B and human rhinovirus was detected in low levels.

InterpretationSocioeconomic disparity determines access to SARS-CoV-2 testing in Brazil. The lower median age of infection and hospitalization compared to other countries is expected due to a younger population structure. Enhanced surveillance of respiratory pathogens across socioeconomic statuses is essential to better understand and halt SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

9636,Easing social distancing index after COVID-19 pandemic,"ContextEasing social distancing (ESD) is a global public health issue in post-pandemic period of COVID-19 and requires a simple index for real time assessment.

ObjectiveWe aimed to develop a simple index for ESD to quantify the impacts of social distancing for reducing confirmed infected cases, optimal triage and care of patients for recovery, and critical care capacity for reducing death from COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsData on the retrospective cohort of 185 countries with reported numbers on confirmed cases, recovery, and death from COVID-19 were retrieved from publicity available repository. Up to May 31, a total of 5,844,136 confirmed cases, 2,639,961 recovered, and 327,487 deaths were reported globally.

Main Outcome MeasuresThe ESD index measured by cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and recovery and case-fatality rate.

ResultsWe developed a simple index for the guidance of easing social distancing (ESD). If the ESD index is less than 1, ESD would be considered. The global ESD index declined from 3.87 at peak in March to 1.35 by the end of May, consisting of 56.76% countries/regions (105/185) with the ESD lower than one.

Conclusion and RelevanceThis simple ESD index provides a quantitative assessment on whether and when to ease social distancing from local to global community.","Chen, L.-S.; Yen, M.-F.; Lai, C.-C.; Hsu, C.-Y.; Chen, H.-H.",2020-06-12,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.11.20128165,1,Hsiu-Hsi Chen,"Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.11.20128165v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.11.20128165v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
13073,Estimation of Effective Reproduction Number for COVID-19 in Bangladesh and its districts,"BackgroundBangladesh is going through an unprecedented crisis since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the reproduction number of COVID-19 swarmed in the scientific community and public media due to its simplicity in explaining an infectious disease dynamic. This paper aims to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt) for COVID-19 over time in Bangladesh and its districts using reported cases.

MethodsAdapted methods derived from Bettencourt and Ribeiro (2008), which is a sequential Bayesian approach using the compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, have been used to estimate Rt.

ResultsAs of July 21, the mean Rt is 1.32(0.98-1.70, 90% HDI), with a median of 1.16(0.99-1.34 90% HDI). The initial Rt of Bangladesh was 3, whereas the Rt on the day of imposing nation-wide lockdown was 1.47, at the end of lockdown phase 1 was 1.06, at the end of lockdown phase 2 was 1.33. Each phase of nation-wide lockdown has contributed to the decline of effective reproduction number (Rt) for Bangladesh by 28.44%, and 26.70%, respectively, implying moderate effectiveness of the epidemic response strategies.

Interpretation and ConclusionThe mean Rt fell by 13.55% from May 31 to July 21, 2020, despite easing of lockdown in Bangladesh. The Rt continued to fall below the threshold value one steadily from the beginning of July and sustained around 1. The mean Rt fell by 13.55% from May 31 to July 21, 2020, despite easing of lockdown in Bangladesh. As of July 21, the current estimate of Rt is 1.07(0.92-1.15: 90% HDI), meaning that an infected individual is spreading the virus to an average of one other, with 0.07 added chance of infecting a second individual. This whole research recommends two things- broader testing and careful calibration of measures to keep Rt a long way below the crucial threshold one.

18015,Evaluating the Efficacy of Tocilizumab in Moderate to Severe COVID-19 with Progressive Illness despite Steroids: Identifying the Optimal Timing of its Administration in C3G study,"BackgroundHigh mortality has been described in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Tocilizumab (TCZ), an interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist may be associated with improved outcomes in such patients; however, the subgroups of patients who benefit the most need to be identified.

ObjectiveTo analyze the efficacy and optimal timing of administration of TCZ in moderate to severe COVID-19 with features of CRS, where the response to steroids was poor.

MethodsThis is a retrospective study of 125 patients admitted between May 5 to July 31, 2020, in a tertiary care hospital in western India, with moderate to severe COVID-19 who were treated with TCZ along with steroids. The primary outcomes were the need for mechanical ventilation (MV) or death, and secondary outcomes were a decrease in oxygen requirement and inflammatory markers; the incidence of secondary infections, and renal or hepatic dysfunction. Kaplan Meier survival analysis and log rank test were used for evaluating primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were analyzed using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test.

ResultsAmong 1081 patients admitted during the study period, 125 were administered TCZ (median age, 56 [95% CI 54 - 60] years; 100 [80%] male). The commonest symptoms were fever (96%), cough (64%), and dyspnea (48.8%). 78.4% patients had comorbidities (hypertension 51.2%, diabetes 43.2%, obesity 25.6% and chronic cardiac disease 13.6%). Of 117 patients who were treated with TCZ before requiring MV, 18.8% progressed to MV. Overall, 25% of the patients needed MV support. 65.3% of patients were discharged by day 14 after TCZ administration. Mortality was nil, 16.2%, 50%, and 62.5% in patients who received TCZ on room air, low flow oxygen, high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and MV respectively; overall 24.8% of patients died. Survival analysis showed no difference in outcome with respect to age and gender, while progression to MV showed a statistically significant reduction for the event death (90.9% of patients who progressed to MV died as compared to 6.3% who did not; log rank test with p < 0.0001). No adverse events were noticed.

ConclusionMortality was least in patients of COVID-19 with CRS who received TCZ while on low flow oxygen. When administered in the early hypoxemic phase, TCZ is associated with reduced mortality and decreased need for mechanical ventilation.","Madan, S.; Rana, M.; Gajjar, R.; Shah, N.; Thakkar, V.; Shah, B.; Dabhi, P.; Patel, M.; Shah, H.; Chovatiya, R.; Soni, M.; Bapat, N.; Patel, A.",2020-11-10,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.11.07.20226837,1,Surabhi Madan,Care Institute of Medical Sciences,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.07.20226837v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.07.20226837v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
8533,A control approach to the Covid-19 disease using a SEIHRD dynamical model,"The recent worldwide epidemic of Covid-19 disease, for which there is no vaccine or medications to prevent or cure it, led to the adoption of public health measures by governments and populations in most of the affected countries to avoid the contagion and its spread. These measures are known as nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and their implementation clearly produces social unrest as well as greatly affects the economy. Frequently, NPIs are implemented with an intensity quantified in an ad hoc manner. Control theory offers a worth-while tool for determining the optimal intensity of the NPIs in order to avoid the collapse of the healthcare system while keeping them as low as possible, yielding in a policymakers concrete guidance. We propose here the use of a simple proportional controller that is robust to large parametric uncertainties in the model used.","Pazos, F.

8053,Single-Cell Analysis Reveals Macrophage-Driven T Cell Dysfunction in Severe COVID-19 Patients,"The vastly spreading COVID-19 pneumonia is caused by SARS-CoV-2. Lymphopenia and cytokine levels are tightly associated with disease severity. However, virus-induced immune dysregulation at cellular and molecular levels remains largely undefined. Here, the leukocytes in the pleural effusion, sputum, and peripheral blood biopsies from severe and mild patients were analyzed at single-cell resolution. Drastic T cell hyperactivation accompanying elevated T cell exhaustion was observed, predominantly in pleural effusion. The mechanistic investigation identified a group of CD14+ monocytes and macrophages highly expressing CD163 and MRC1 in the biopsies from severe patients, suggesting M2 macrophage polarization. These M2-like cells exhibited up-regulated IL10, CCL18, APOE, CSF1 (M-CSF), and CCL2 signaling pathways. Further, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were observed in pleural effusion earlier than in peripheral blood. Together, our results suggest that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection causes immune dysregulation by inducing M2 polarization and subsequent T cell exhaustion. This study improves our understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Liu, X.; Zhu, A.; He, J.; Chen, Z.; Liu, L.; Xu, Y.; Ye, F.; Feng, H.; Luo, L.; Cai, B.; Mai, Y.; Lin, L.; Zhang, Z.; Chen, S.; Shi, J.; Wen, L.; Wei, Y.; Zhuo, J.; Zhao, Y.; Li, F.; Wei, X.; Chen, D.; Zhang, X.; Zhong, N.; Huang, Y.; Liu, H.; Wang, J.; Xu, X.; Wang, J.; Chen, R.; Chen, X.; Zhong, N.; Zhao, J.; Li, Y.; Zhao, J.; Chen, J.",2020-05-26,Pathology,10.1101/2020.05.23.20100024,1,Jiekai Chen,"Guangzhou Regenerative Medicine and Health-Guangdong Laboratory (GRMH-GDL), Guangzhou, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.23.20100024v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.23.20100024v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1007/s13238-020-00752-4
21398,Rates of serious clinical outcomes in survivors of hospitalisation with COVID-19: a descriptive cohort study within the OpenSAFELY platform,"BackgroundPatients with COVID-19 are thought to be at higher risk of cardiometabolic and pulmonary complications, but quantification of that risk is limited. We aimed to describe the overall burden of these complications in survivors of severe COVID-19.

MethodsWorking on behalf of NHS England, we used linked primary care records, death certificate and hospital data from the OpenSAFELY platform. We constructed three cohorts: patients discharged following hospitalisation with COVID-19, patients discharged following hospitalisation with pneumonia in 2019, and a frequency-matched cohort from the general population in 2019. We studied eight cardiometabolic and pulmonary outcomes. Absolute rates were measured in each cohort and Cox regression models were fitted to estimate age/sex adjusted hazard ratios comparing outcome rates between discharged COVID-19 patients and the two comparator cohorts.

ResultsAmongst the population of 31,716 patients discharged following hospitalisation with COVID-19, rates for majority of outcomes peaked in the first month post-discharge, then declined over the following four months. Patients in the COVID-19 population had markedly increased risk of all outcomes compared to matched controls from the 2019 general population, especially for pulmonary embolism (HR 12.86; 95% CI: 11.23 - 14.74). Outcome rates were more similar when comparing patients discharged with COVID-19 to those discharged with pneumonia in 2019, although COVID-19 patients had increased risk of type 2 diabetes (HR 1.23; 95% CI: 1.05 - 1.44).

InterpretationCardiometabolic and pulmonary adverse outcomes are markedly raised following hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared to the general population. However, the excess risks were more comparable to those seen following hospitalisation with pneumonia. Identifying patients at particularly high risk of outcomes would inform targeted preventive measures.

10042,"A novel comprehensive metric to assess COVID-19 testing outcomes: Effects of geography, government, and policy response","Testing and case identification are key strategies in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Contact tracing and isolation are only possible if cases have been identified. The effectiveness of testing must be tracked, but a single comprehensive metric is not available to assess testing effectiveness, and no timely estimates of case detection rate are available globally, making inter-country comparisons difficult. The purpose of this paper was to propose a single, comprehensive metric, called the COVID-19 Testing Index (CovTI) scaled from 0 to 100, that incorporated several testing metrics. The index was based on case-fatality rate, test positivity rate, active cases, and an estimate of the detection rate. It used parsimonious modeling to estimate the true total number of COVID-19 cases based on deaths, testing, health system capacity, and government transparency. Publicly reported data from 188 countries and territories were included in the index. Estimates of detection rates aligned with previous estimates in literature (R2=0.97). As of June 3, 2020, the states with the highest CovTI included Iceland, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Thailand, and some island nations. Globally, CovTI increased from April 20 [Formula] to June 3 [Formula] but declined in ca. 10% of countries. Bivariate analyses showed the average in countries with open public testing policies (59.7, 95% CI 55.6-63.8) were significantly higher than countries with no testing policy (30.2, 95% CI 18.1-42.3) (p<0.0001). A multiple linear regression model assessed the association of independent grouping variables with CovTI. Open public testing and extensive contact tracing were shown to significantly increase CovTI, after adjusting for extrinsic factors, including geographic isolation and centralized forms of government. This tool may be useful for policymakers to assess testing effectiveness, inform decisions, and identify model countries. It may also serve as a tool for researchers in analyses by combining it with other databases.","Kuster, A. C.; Overgaard, H.

19993,Blood group A Secretors are associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 cardiovascular disease complications,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes COVID-19, an infection capable of causing severe disease and death but which may also be asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic in many individuals. While several risk factors, including age, have been described, the mechanisms of this variation are poorly understood. Several studies have described associations between blood group and COVID-19 severity, while others do not. Expression of ABO glycans on secreted proteins and non-erythroid cells is controlled by a fucosyltransferase (FUT2). Inactivating mutations result in a non-secretor phenotype which is known to protect against some viral infections. We investigated whether ABO or secretor status was associated with COVID-19 severity. Data combined from healthcare records and laboratory tests (n=275) of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients hospitalised with COVID-19, confirmed higher than expected numbers of blood group A individuals compared to O (RR=1.24, CI 95% [1.05,1.47], P=0.0111). There was also a significant association between group A and COVID-19-related cardiovascular complications (RR=2.56, CI 95% [1.43,4.55], P=0.0011) which is independent of gender. Molecular analysis of phenotype revealed that group A patients who are non-secretors are significantly less likely to be hospitalised than secretors. In a larger cohort of 1000 convalescent plasma donors, among whom the majority displayed COVID-19 symptoms and only a small minority required hospitalisation, group A non-secretors were slightly over-represented. Our findings indicate that group A non-secretors are not resistant to infection by SARS-CoV-2, but they are likely to experience a less severe form of its associated disease.

19562,How detection ranges and usage stops impact digital contact tracing effectiveness for COVID-19,"To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have adopted digital contact tracing apps. Various technologies exist to trace contacts that are potentially prone to different types of tracing errors. Here, we study the impact of different proximity detection ranges on the effectiveness and efficiency of digital contact tracing apps. Furthermore, we study a usage stop effect induced by a false positive quarantine. Our results reveal that policy makers should adjust digital contact tracing apps to the behavioral characteristics of a society. Based on this, the proximity detection range should at least cover the range of a disease spread, and be much wider in certain cases.

25681,Resolutive results with oral corticosteroids for patients with COVID-19 in pulmonary inflammatory phase. Successful outpatient experience during the collapse of Belem do Para Health System - Brazil.,"In the face of new diseases, medicine needs to reinvent itself in order to contain and control epidemics, such as the one we have recently faced, COVID-19, a disease with a wide spectrum of clinical severity. A new moment has been established, since the application of well known, effective and safe medications for other diseases, has shown high success rates in the treatment of COVID-19. Thereunto, studies with early intervention are needed, which can change the unfavorable outcome of patients. In this article, we report the successful experience using an oral strategy during the collapse of Belem do Para Health System, Brazil. Two hundred and ten patients were diagnosed with respiratory failure due to COVID-19, with no option of hospital treatment due to lack of beds and resources. These patients were then started on therapeutic regimen consisting of prednisolone, enoxaparin and macrolides associated and followed in outpatient facilities. Two hundred and eight patients had excellent therapeutic response and there were only two fatalities. These results push research boundaries, valuing outpatient treatment with early use of prednisolone in the initial pulmonary phase, preventing severe COVID-19 pneumonitis. Adoption of the proposed treatment intends to reduce the need for hospitalization, as well as lethality, with social robust benefits and incalculable economic savings since involves the use of accessible, safe and not expensive medications.","Zeballos, R.

24294,Improved Prediction of COVID-19 Transmission and Mortality Using Google Search Trends for Symptoms in the United States,"Accurate forecasting of emerging infectious diseases can guide public health officials in making appropriate decisions related to the allocation of public health resources. Due to the exponential spread of the COVID-19 infection worldwide, several computational models for forecasting the transmission and mortality rates of COVID-19 have been proposed in the literature. To accelerate scientific and public health insights into the spread and impact of COVID-19, Google released the Google COVID-19 search trends symptoms open-access dataset. Our objective is to develop 7 and 14 -day-ahead forecasting models of COVID-19 transmission and mortality in the US using the Google search trends for COVID-19 related symptoms. Specifically, we propose a stacked long short-term memory (SLSTM) architecture for predicting COVID-19 confirmed and death cases using historical time series data combined with auxiliary time series data from the Google COVID-19 search trends symptoms dataset. Considering the SLSTM networks trained using historical data only as the base models, our base models for 7 and 14 -day-ahead forecasting of COVID cases had the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values of 6.6% and 8.8%, respectively. On the other side, our proposed models had improved MAPE values of 3.2% and 5.6%, respectively. For 7 and 14 -day-ahead forecasting of COVID-19 deaths, the MAPE values of the base models were 4.8% and 11.4%, while the improved MAPE values of our proposed models were 4.7% and 7.8%, respectively. We found that the Google search trends for """"pneumonia,"""" """"shortness of breath,"""" and """"fever"""" are the most informative search trends for predicting COVID-19 transmission. We also found that the search trends for """"hypoxia"""" and """"fever"""" were the most informative trends for forecasting COVID-19 mortality.","Alruily, M.; Ezz, M.; Mostafa, A.

18494,Regular universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection may not allow reopening of society after controlling a pandemic wave,"BackgroundTo limit societal and economic costs of lockdown measures, public health strategies are needed that control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and simultaneously allow lifting of disruptive measures. Regular universal random screening of large proportions of the population regardless of symptoms has been proposed as a possible control strategy.

MethodsWe developed a mathematical model that includes test sensitivity depending on infectiousness for PCR-based and antigen-based tests, and different levels of onward transmission for testing and non-testing parts of the population. Only testing individuals participate in high-risk transmission events, allowing more transmission in case of unnoticed infection. We calculated the required testing interval and coverage to bring the effective reproduction number due to universal random testing (Rrt) below 1, for different scenarios of risk behavior of testing and non-testing individuals.

FindingsWith R0 = 2.5, lifting all control measures for tested subjects with negative test results would require 100% of the population being tested every three days with a rapid test method with similar sensitivity as PCR-based tests. With remaining measures in place reflecting Re = 1.3, 80% of the population would need to be tested once a week to bring Rrt below 1. With lower proportions tested and with lower test sensitivity, testing frequency should increase further to bring Rrt below 1. With similar Re values for tested and non-tested subjects, and with tested subjects not allowed to engage in higher risk events, at least 80% of the populations needs to test every five days to bring Rrt below. The impact of the test-sensitivity on the reproduction number is far less than the frequency of testing.

InterpretationRegular universal random screening followed by isolation of infectious individuals is not a viable strategy to reopen society after controlling a pandemic wave of SARS-CoV-2. More targeted screening approaches are needed to better use rapid testing such that it can effectively complement other control measures.

23492,Investigating the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine using epidemiological and genomic sequencing data,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China in December 2019 and has rapidly spread around the globe. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020 just three months after the introduction of the virus. Individual nations have implemented and enforced with varying degrees of success a variety of social distancing interventions to slow the virus spread. Investigating the role of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 transmission in different settings is an important research. While most transmission modeling studies have focused on the dynamics in China, neighboring Asian counties, Western Europe, and North America, there is a scarcity of studies for Eastern Europe. This study starts to fill this gap by analyzing the characteristics of the first epidemic wave in Ukraine using mathematical and statistical models together with epidemiological and genomic sequencing data. Using an agent-based model, the trajectory of the first wave in terms of cases and deaths and explore the impact of quarantine strategies via simulation studies have been characterized. The implemented stochastic model for epidemic counts suggests, that even a small delay of weeks could have increased the number of cases by up to 50%, with the potential to overwhelm hospital systems. The genomic data analysis suggests that there have been multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Ukraine during the early stages of the epidemic with eight distinct transmission clusters identified. The basic reproduction number for the epidemic has been estimated independently both from case counts data and from genomic data. The findings support the hypothesis that, the public health measures did not have a decreasing effect on the existing viral population number at the time of implementation, since strains were detected after the quarantine date. However, the public health measures did help to prevent the appearance of new (and potentially more virulent) SARS-CoV-2 variants in Ukraine.","Gankin, Y.; Koniukhovskii, V.; Nemira, A.; Chowell, G.; Weppelmann, T.

19688,Environmental monitoring shows SARS-CoV-2 contamination of surfaces in food plants,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has presented new challenges to food manufacturers. In addition to preventing the spread of microbial contamination of food, with SARS-CoV-2, there is an additional focus on preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections in food plant personnel. During the early phase of the pandemic, several large outbreaks of Covid-19 occurred in food manufacturing plants resulting in deaths and economic loss. In March of 2020, we assisted in implementation of environmental monitoring programs for SARS-CoV-2 in 116 food production facilities. All participating facilities had already implemented measures to prevent symptomatic personnel from coming to work. During the study period, from March 17, 2020 to September 3, 2020, 1.23% of the 22,643 environmental samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that infected individuals are actively shedding virus. Virus contamination was commonly found on frequently touched surfaces. Most plants managed to control their environmental contamination when they became aware of the positive findings. Comparisons of the personnel test results to environmental contamination in one plant showed a good correlation between the two. Our work illustrates that environmental monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 can be used as a surrogate for identifying the presence of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic personnel in workplaces and may aid in controlling infection spread.

22897,SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance identifies naturally occurring truncations of ORF7a that limit immune suppression,"Over 200,000 whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 have been determined for viruses isolated from around the world. These sequences have been critical for understanding the spread and evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Using global phylogenomics, we show that mutations frequently occur in the C-terminal end of ORF7a. We have isolated one of these mutant viruses from a patient sample and used viral chal-lenge experiments to demonstrate that {Delta}115 mutation results in a growth defect. ORF7a has been implicated in immune modulation, and we show that the C-terminal truncation results in distinct changes in interferon stimulated gene expression. Collectively, this work indicates that ORF7a mutations occur frequently and that these changes affect viral mechanisms responsible for suppressing the immune response.

HighlightsO_LIORF7a mutations are found in SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from around the globe.

9048,A modified SEIR meta-population transmission based Modeling and Forecasting of the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started from China at the end of 2019, has now spread across the globe. Modeling and simulation of the COVID-19 outspread is significant for timely and effective measures to be taken. Scientists around the world are using various epidemiological models to help policymakers to plan and determine what interventions and resources will be needed in case of a surge and to estimate the potential future burden on health care system. Pakistan is also among the affected countries with 18th highest number of total detected number of cases, as of 3rd of June, 2020. A modified time-dependent Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) metapopulation transmission model is used in the Global Epidemic and Mobility Model (GLEaM) for this simulation. The simulation assumes the index case in Wuhan, China and models the global spread of SARS-COV-2 with reasonable results for several countries within the 95% confidence interval. This model was then tuned with parameters for Pakistan to predict the outspread of COVID-19 in Pakistan. The impact of Non-Drug Interventions on """"flattening the curve"""" are also incorporated in the simulation and the results are further extended to find the peak of the pandemic and future predictions. It has been observed that in the current scenario, the epidemic trend of COVID-19 spread in Pakistan would attain a peak in the second decade of month of June with approximately (3600-4200) daily cases. The current wave of SARS-COV-2 in Pakistan with is estimated to cause some (210,000 - 226,000) cumulative cases and (4400-4750) cumulative lost lives by the end of August when the epidemic is reduced by 99%. However, the disease is controllable in the likely future if inclusive and strict control measures are taken.","Hassan, S.; Mughal, B.

11701,Inference of COVID-19 epidemiological distributions from Brazilian hospital data,"Knowing COVID-19 epidemiological distributions, such as the time from patient admission to death, is directly relevant to effective primary and secondary care planning, and moreover, the mathematical modelling of the pandemic generally. We determine epidemiological distributions for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 using a large dataset (N = 21,000 - 157,000) from the Brazilian Sistema de Informacao de Vigilancia Epidemiologica da Gripe database. A joint Bayesian subnational model with partial pooling is used to simultaneously describe the 26 states and one federal district of Brazil, and shows significant variation in the mean of the symptom-onset-to-death time, with ranges between 11.2-17.8 days across the different states, and a mean of 15.2 days for Brazil. We find strong evidence in favour of specific probability density function choices: for example, the gamma distribution gives the best fit for onset-to-death and the generalised lognormal for onset-to-hospital-admission. Our results show that epidemiological distributions have considerable geographical variation, and provide the first estimates of these distributions in a low and middle-income setting. At the subnational level, variation in COVID-19 outcome timings are found to be correlated with poverty, deprivation and segregation levels, and weaker correlation is observed for mean age, wealth and urbanicity.","Hawryluk, I.; Mellan, T.

Methods: Outpatients who had recently been diagnosed with COVID-19 or were presenting with suspected COVID-19 were asked to have a nasopharyngeal swab collected and provide at least one self-collected sample type. A portion of participants were also asked about sample acceptability. Samples underwent molecular testing using multiple assays. Saline mouth rinse/gargle and saliva samples were tested daily at time zero, day one, and day 2 to assess nucleic acid stability at room temperature. Results: 50 participants (aged 4 to 71 years) were included; of these, 40 had at least one positive sample and were included in the primary sample yield analysis. Saline mouth rinse/gargle samples had a sensitivity of 98% (39/40) while saliva samples had a sensitivity of 79% (26/33). Both saline mouth rinse/gargle and saliva samples showed stable viral RNA detection after 2 days of room temperature storage. Mouth rinse/gargle samples had the highest (mean 4.9) and HCW-collected NP swabs had the lowest acceptability scores (mean 3.1). Conclusion: Saline mouth rinse/gargle samples demonstrated the highest combined user acceptability ratings and analytical performance when compared with saliva and HCW collected NP swabs.

25155,"SARS-CoV-2 UK, South African and Brazilian Variants in Karachi- Pakistan","COVID-19 pandemic has been evolving in Pakistan since the UK, South African and Brazilian variants have started surfacing which are known for increase transmissibility and can also be responsible for escape from immune responses. The gold standard to detect these variants of concern is sequencing, however routine genomic surveillance in resource limited countries like Pakistan is not always readily available. With the emergence of variants of concern and a dearth of facilities for genomic scrutiny leaves policy makers and health authorities an inconsistent and twisted image to make decisions. The inadvertent detection of B.1.1.7 by target failure because of a key deletion in spike {Delta}69-70 in the UK by commercially available COVID-19 PCR assay helps to understand target failures as an alternative approach to detect variants. It was ascertained further that a deletion in the ORF1a gene (ORF1a {Delta}3675-3677) found common in B.1.1.7, B.135 and P.1 variants of concern. The Real Time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay for detection of emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants, by these target failures is used here. The positive samples archived in respective labs were divided in two groups used in the present study. Group I constitutes 261 positive samples out of 16964 (1.53%) collected from August till September 2020. Group II include 3501 positive samples out of 46041 (7.60%) from November 2020 till January 2021. In positive samples of group I, no variant of concern was found. A staggering difference in results was noted in group II where positivity ratio increased exponentially and the variants of concern started appearing in significant numbers (53.64% overall). This is indicative that the third wave in Pakistan is due to the importation of SARS-CoV-2 variants. This calls for measures to increase surveillance by RT-qPCR which would help authorities in decision making.","Khan, A.; Hanif, M.; Syed, S.; Ahmed, A.; Ghazali, S.; Khanani, R.",2021-04-13,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.04.09.21255179,1,Muhammad Hanif,"1) Karachi Institute of Radiotherapy and Nuclear Medicine (KIRAN), Karachi and 2) Advanced Laboratories, Karachi",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.09.21255179v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.09.21255179v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
11522,"Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown Policy on Homicide, Suicide, and Motor Vehicle Deaths in Peru","IntroductionAlthough lockdown measures to stop COVID-19 have direct effects on disease transmission, their impact on violent and accidental deaths remains unknown. Our study aims to assess the early impact of COVID-19 lockdown on violent and accidental deaths in Peru.

MethodsBased on data from the Peruvian National Death Information System, an interrupted time series analysis was performed to assess the immediate impact and change in the trend of COVID-19 lockdown on external causes of death including homicide, suicide, and traffic accidents. The analysis was stratified by sex and the time unit was every 15 days.

ResultsAll forms of deaths examined presented a sudden drop after the lockdown. The biggest drop was in deaths related to traffic accidents, with a reduction of 12.66 deaths per million men per month (95% CI: -15.56, -9.76) and 3.64 deaths per million women per month (95% CI:-5.25, -2.03). Homicide and suicide presented similar level drop in women, while the homicide reduction was twice the size of the suicide reduction in men. The slope in suicide in men during the lock-down period increased by 3.62 deaths per million men per year (95% CI:0.06, 7.18). No other change in slope was detected.

ConclusionsViolent and accidental deaths presented a sudden drop after the lockdown was implemented and an increase in suicide in men was observed. Falls in mobility have a natural impact on traffic accidents, however, the patterns for suicide and homicide are less intuitive and reveal important characteristics of these events, although we expect all of these changes to be transient.","Calderon-Anyosa, R.

Nevertheless, there is limited information describing the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Latin America.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 9,468 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in Ecuador. We calculated overall incidence, mortality, case fatality rates, disability adjusted life years, attack and crude mortality rates, as well as relative risk and relative odds of death, adjusted for age, sex and presence of comorbidities.

ResultsA total of 9,468 positive COVID-19 cases and 474 deaths were included in the analysis. Men accounted for 55.4% (n = 5, 247) of cases and women for 44.6% (n = 4, 221). We found the presence of comorbidities, being male and older than 65 years were important determinants of mortality. Coastal regions were most affected by COVID-19, with higher mortality rates than the highlands. Fatigue was reported in 53.2% of the patients, followed by headache (43%), dry cough (41.7%), ageusia (37.1%) and anosmia (36.1%).

ConclusionWe present the first analysis of the burden of COVID-19 in Ecuador. Our findings show that men are at higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than women, and risk increases with age and the presence of comorbidities. We also found that blue-collar workers and the unemployed are at greater risk of dying.

4964,The current COVID-19 wave will likely be mitigated in the second-line European countries,"ObjectiveCountries presently apply different strategies to control the COVID-19 outbreak. Differences in population structures, decision making, health systems and numerous other factors result in various trajectories in terms of mortality at country scale. Our objective in this manuscript is to disentangle the future of second-line European countries (i.e. countries that present, today, a moderate death rate) with respect to the current COVID-19 wave.

MethodWe propose a data-driven approach, grounded on a mixture model, to forecast the dynamics of the number of deaths from COVID-19 in a given focal country using data from countries that are ahead in time in terms of COVID-19-induced mortality. In this approach, the mortality curves of ahead-in-time countries are used to build predictors, which are then used as the components of the mixture model. This approach was applied to eight second-line European countries (Austria, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Sweden), using Belgium, France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom as well as the Hubei province in China to build predictors. For this analysis, we used data pooled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.

ResultsIn general, the second-line European countries tend to follow relatively mild mortality curves (typically, those of Switzerland and Hubei) rather than fast and severe ones (typically, those of Spain, Italy, Belgium, France and the United Kingdom). From a methodological viewpoint, the performance of our forecasting approach is about 80% up to 8 days in the future, as soon as the focal country has accumulated at least two hundreds of deaths.

DiscussionOur results suggest that the continuation of the current COVID-19 wave across Europe will likely be mitigated, and not as strong as it was in most of the front-line countries first impacted by the wave.","Soubeyrand, S.; Ribaud, M.; Baudrot, V.; Allard, D.; Pommeret, D.; Roques, L.",2020-04-22,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.17.20069179,1,Samuel Soubeyrand,INRAE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069179v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069179v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,"NA"
14377,Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 patients and healthy volunteers,"SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a novel human pathogen, causing clinical signs, from fever to pneumonia - COVID-19 - but may remain mild or even asymptomatic. To understand the continuing spread of the virus, to detect those who are and were infected, and to follow the immune response longitudinally, reliable and robust assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection and immunological monitoring are needed and have been setup around the world. We quantified immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgG and IgA antibodies recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) or the Spike (S) protein over a period of five months following COVID-19 disease onset or in previously SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive volunteers. We report the detailed setup to monitor the humoral immune response from over 300 COVID-19 hospital patients and healthcare workers, 2500 University staff and 187 post-COVID19 volunteers, and assessing titres for IgM, IgG and IgA. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses followed a classic pattern with a rapid increase within the first three weeks after symptoms. Although titres reduce from approximately four weeks, the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies remained robust for five months in a large proportion of previously virus-positive screened subjects. Our work provides detailed information for the assays used, facilitating further and longitudinal analysis of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it highlights a continued level of circulating neutralising antibodies in most people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2, at least up to five months after infection.","Figueiredo-Campos, P.; Blankenhaus, B.; Mota, C.; Gomes, A.; Serrano, M.; Ariotti, S.; Costa, C.; Nunes-Cabaco, H.; Mendes, A.

19740,Decay of Fc-dependent antibody functions after mild to moderate COVID-19,"The capacity of antibodies to engage with innate and adaptive immune cells via the Fc region is important in preventing and controlling many infectious diseases, and is likely critical in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The evolution of such antibodies during convalescence from COVID-19 is largely unknown. We developed novel assays to measure Fc-dependent antibody functions against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-expressing cells in serial samples from a cohort of 53 subjects primarily with mild-moderate COVID-19, out to a maximum of 149 days post-infection. We found that S-specific antibodies capable of engaging dimeric Fc{gamma}RIIa and Fc{gamma}RIIIa decayed linearly over time. S-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) activity within plasma declined linearly as well, in line with the decay of S-specific IgG. Although there was significant decay in S-specific plasma ADCC and ADP activity, they remained readily detectable by all assays in 94% of our cohort at the last timepoint studied, in contrast with neutralisation activity which was only detectable in 70% of our cohort by the last timepoint. Our results suggest that Fc effector functions such as ADCC and ADP could contribute to the durability of SARS-CoV-2 immunity, particularly late in convalescence when neutralising antibodies have waned. Understanding the protective potential of antibody Fc effector functions is critical for defining the durability of immunity generated by infection or vaccination.","Lee, W. S.; Selva, K.

6626,Neutrophil calprotectin identifies severe pulmonary disease in COVID-19,"Severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are regularly complicated by respiratory failure. While it has been suggested that elevated levels of blood neutrophils associate with worsening oxygenation in COVID-19, it is unknown whether neutrophils are drivers of the thrombo-inflammatory storm or simple bystanders. To better understand the potential role of neutrophils in COVID-19, we measured levels of the neutrophil activation marker S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) in hospitalized patients and determined its relationship to severity of illness and respiratory status. Patients with COVID-19 (n=172) had markedly elevated levels of calprotectin in their blood. Calprotectin tracked with other acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and absolute neutrophil count, but was superior in identifying patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In longitudinal samples, calprotectin rose as oxygenation worsened. When tested on day 1 or 2 of hospitalization (n=94 patients), calprotectin levels were significantly higher in patients who progressed to severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (8039 {+/-} 7031 ng/ml, n=32) as compared to those who remained free of intubation (3365 {+/-} 3146, p<0.0001). In summary, serum calprotectin levels track closely with current and future COVID-19 severity, implicating neutrophils as potential perpetuators of inflammation and respiratory compromise in COVID-19.","Shi, H.; Zuo, Y.; Yalavarthi, S.; Gockman, K.; Zuo, M.; Madison, J.

20666,Saliva viral load is a dynamic unifying correlate of COVID-19 severity and mortality,"While several clinical and immunological parameters correlate with disease severity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infection, work remains in identifying unifying correlates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that can be used to guide clinical practice. Here, we examine saliva and nasopharyngeal (NP) viral load over time and correlate them with patient demographics, and cellular and immune profiling. We found that saliva viral load was significantly higher in those with COVID-19 risk factors; that it correlated with increasing levels of disease severity and showed a superior ability over nasopharyngeal viral load as a predictor of mortality over time (AUC=0.90). A comprehensive analysis of immune factors and cell subsets revealed strong predictors of high and low saliva viral load, which were associated with increased disease severity or better overall outcomes, respectively. Saliva viral load was positively associated with many known COVID-19 inflammatory markers such as IL-6, IL-18, IL-10, and CXCL10, as well as type 1 immune response cytokines. Higher saliva viral loads strongly correlated with the progressive depletion of platelets, lymphocytes, and effector T cell subsets including circulating follicular CD4 T cells (cTfh). Anti-spike (S) and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG levels were negatively correlated with saliva viral load showing a strong temporal association that could help distinguish severity and mortality in COVID-19. Finally, patients with fatal COVID-19 exhibited higher viral loads, which correlated with the depletion of cTfh cells, and lower production of anti-RBD and anti-S IgG levels. Together these results demonstrated that viral load - as measured by saliva but not nasopharyngeal -- is a dynamic unifying correlate of disease presentation, severity, and mortality over time.","Silva, J.; Lucas, C.; Sundaram, M.; Israelow, B.; Wong, P.; Klein, J.; Tokuyama, M.; Lu, P.; Venkataraman, A.; Liu, F.; Mao, T.; Oh, J.

23453,"Covid-19 in the California State Prison System: An Observational Study of Decarceration, Ongoing Risks, and Risk Factors","BackgroundCorrectional institutions nationwide are seeking to mitigate Covid-19-related risks.

ObjectiveTo quantify changes to Californias prison population since the pandemic began and identify risk factors for Covid-19 infection.

DesignWe described residents demographic characteristics, health status, Covid-19 risk scores, room occupancy, and labor participation. We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the association between rates of Covid-19 infection and room occupancy and out-of-room labor, respectively.

SettingCalifornia state prisons (March 1-October 10, 2020).

ParticipantsResidents of California state prisons.

MeasurementsChanges in the incarcerated populations size, composition, housing, and activities. For the risk factor analysis, the exposure variables were room type (cells vs dormitories) and labor participation (any room occupant participating in the prior 2 weeks) and the outcome variable was incident Covid-19 case rates.

ResultsThe incarcerated population decreased 19.1% (119,401 to 96,623) during the study period.On October 10, 2020, 11.5% of residents were aged [&ge;]60, 18.3% had high Covid-19 risk scores, 31.0% participated in out-of-room labor, and 14.8% lived in rooms with [&ge;]10 occupants. Nearly 40% of residents with high Covid-19 risk scores lived in dormitories. In 9 prisons with major outbreaks (6,928 rooms; 21,750 residents), dormitory residents had higher infection rates than cell residents (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 2.51 95%CI, 2.25-2.80) and residents of rooms with labor participation had higher rates than residents of other rooms (AHR, 1.56; 95%CI, 1.39-1.74).

LimitationsInability to measure density of residents living conditions or contact networks among residents and staff.

ConclusionDespite reductions in room occupancy and mixing, California prisons still house many medically vulnerable residents in risky settings. Reducing risks further requires a combination of strategies, including rehousing, decarceration, and vaccination.

19340,"Galectin antagonist use in mild cases of SARS-CoV-2; pilot feasibility randomised, open label, controlled trial","ImportanceNovel SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected nearly half a billion people across the world and is highly contagious. There is a need for a novel mechanism to block viral entry and stop its replication.

BackgroundSpike protein N terminal domain (NTD) of the novel SARS-CoV-2 is essential for viral entry and replication in human cell. Thus the S1 NTD of human coronavirus family, which is similar to a galectin binding site - human galactose binding lectins, is a potential novel target for early treatment in COVID-19.

ObjectivesTo study the feasibility of performing a definitive trial of using galectin antagonist - Prolectin-M as treatment for mild, symptomatic, rRT-PCR positive, COVID-19.

Main outcomes and measuresCycle threshold (Ct) value is number of cycles needed to express fluorescence, on real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Ct values expressed for RNA polymerase (Rd/RP) gene +Nucleocapsid gene and the small envelope (E) genes determine infectivity of the individual. A digital droplet PCR based estimation of the Nucleocapid genes (N1+N2) in absolute copies/L determines active viral replication.

Design and interventionPilot Feasibility Randomised Controlled Open-Label, parallel arm, study. Oral tablets of Prolectin-M were administered along with the best practice, Standard of Care (SoC) and compared against SoC. Voluntarily, consenting individuals, age >18 years, and able to provide frequent nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were randomly allocated by REDCap software.

The intervention, Prolectin-M was administered as a multi dose regime of 4 gram tablets. Each tablet contained 2 grams of (1-6)-Alpha-D-mannopyranosil mixed with 2 grams of dietary fibre. Each participant took a single chewable tablet every hour, to a maximum of 10 hours in a day. Tablets were administered only during the daytime, for total of 5 days.

ResultsThis pilot trial demonstrated the feasibility to recruit and randomize participants. By day 7, following treatment with Prolectin-M, Ct value of Rd/Rp + N gene increased by16.41 points, 95% (CI - 0.3527 to 32.48, p=0.047). Similarly, small envelope (E) gene also increased by 17.75 points (95% CI;-0.1321 to 35.63, p = 0.05). The expression of N1, N2 genes went below detectable thresholds by day 3 (Mann Whitney U = 0.000, p<0.029).

rRT-PCR testing done in the clinic on day 1, 7, and 14 had 3 participants (60%) turn negative by day 7 and all turned negative by day 14 and stayed negative until day 28. In the SoC group 2 participants had zero detectable viral loads at baseline, 2 participants tested negative on day 14, and the last participant tested remained positive on day 28. There were no serious adverse events, and all participants were clinically asymptomatic before day 28 with reactive immunoglobulin G (IgG).

Trial relevanceThis pilot study proves that it is feasible and safe to perform a trial using a Galectin antagonist in COVID-19. This is a novel mechanism for blocking viral entry and its subsequent replication.

9044,The impact of school reopening on the spread of COVID-19 in England,"By mid-May, cases of COVID-19 in the UK had been declining for over a month; a multi-phase emergence from lockdown was planned, including a scheduled partial reopening of schools on 1st June. Although evidence suggests that children generally display mild symptoms, the size of the school-age population means the total impact of reopening schools is unclear. Here, we present work from mid-May that focused on the imminent opening of schools and consider what these results imply for future policy.

We compared eight strategies for reopening primary and secondary schools in England. Modifying a transmission model fitted to UK SARS-CoV-2 data, we assessed how reopening schools affects contact patterns, anticipated secondary infections and the relative change in the reproduction number, R. We determined the associated public health impact and its sensitivity to changes in social-distancing within the wider community.

We predicted reopening schools with half-sized classes or focused on younger children was unlikely to push R above one. Older children generally have more social contacts, so reopening secondary schools results in more cases than reopening primary schools, while reopening both could have pushed R above one in some regions. Reductions in community social-distancing were found to outweigh and exacerbate any impacts of reopening. In particular, opening schools when the reproduction number R is already above one generates the largest increase in cases.

Our work indicates that while any school reopening will result in increased mixing and infection amongst children and the wider population, reopening schools alone in June was unlikely to push R above one. Ultimately, reopening decisions are a difficult trade-off between epidemiological consequences and the emotional, educational and developmental needs of children. Into the future, there are difficult questions about what controls can be instigated such that schools can remain open if cases increase.","Keeling, M. J.; Tildesley, M. J.; Atkins, B.

17725,Experience from a COVID-19 screening centre of a tertiary care institution: A retrospective hospital-based study,"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic continuing to be a significant public health concern across the whole world, including India. In the absence of any specific treatment or vaccine against COVID-19., the role of efficient testing and reporting has been uncontested so far as the number of cases is rising daily. In order to strengthen the screening activities and to prevent nosocomial infection, facility-based screening centres have been designed and operated at various level of healthcare, including tertiary care institutions.

MethodsThe present study has been planned with an objective to understand the patient profile and evaluate the functioning of COVID-19 screening OPD(CS-OPD) at a tertiary care hospital. In this hospital-based retrospective study, data from individuals visiting the COVID-19 screening OPD during the period from 17th March 2020 to 31st July 2020 were collected. We documented and analysed relevant demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the patients.

ResultsA total of 10,735 patients visited the COVID-19 screening OPD during the defined study period out of which 3652 individuals were tested. Majority of the patients, i.e. 65.67% (7050) were male and in 15-59 years age group (84.68%). Most common symptoms among patients visiting CS-OPD was Cough (9.86%). Out of the total, 17.17% (1843) of patient reported to the CS-OPD with contact history of COVID-19 positive patient. On the other hand, 13.49% (1448) of patients were with either domestic or international travel history. The overall testing rate and positivity rate for CS-OPD during this period were found to be 34.02% and 7.94% respectively.

ConclusionThe clinical, demographic and epidemiological characteristics of patients visiting CS-OPD varied across the study period depending upon the containment and testing strategy. The CS-OPD played a crucial role in preventing nosocomial infection and maintaining non-COVID care at the tertiary care hospital.","Pradhan, S. K.; Sahu, D. P.; Sahoo, D. P.; Patro, B. K.; Singh, A.

2596,Impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China,"This paper examines the role of various socioeconomic factors in mediating the local and cross-city transmissions of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) in China. We implement a machine learning approach to select instrumental variables that strongly predict virus transmission among the rich exogenous weather characteristics. Our 2SLS estimates show that the stringent quarantine, massive lockdown and other public health measures imposed in late January significantly reduced the transmission rate of COVID-19. By early February, the virus spread had been contained. While many socioeconomic factors mediate the virus spread, a robust government response since late January played a determinant role in the containment of the virus. We also demonstrate that the actual population flow from the outbreak source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. The results have rich implications for ongoing global efforts in containment of COVID-19.","Qiu, Y.; Chen, X.; Shi, W.",2020-03-17,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.13.20035238,1,Wei Shi,Jinan University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035238v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035238v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1007/s00148-020-00778-2

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis to examine the spatial associations of daily PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations with death rate of COVID-19 in China through multiple linear regression method. We found that COVID-19 held higher death rates with increasing concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 levels in the spatial scale, which may affect the process of patients developed from mild to severe and finally influence the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.","Yao, Y.; Pan, J.; Wang, W.; Liu, Z.; Kan, H.; Meng, X.; Wang, W.",2020-04-10,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.07.20052142,1,Weibing Wang,"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20052142v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20052142v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
21520,SARS-CoV-2 RNA screening in routine pathology specimens,"Virus detection methods are important to cope with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics. Apart from the lung, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in multiple organs in severe cases. Less is known on organ tropism in patients developing mild or no symptoms, and some of such patients might be missed in symptom-indicated swab testing.

Here we tested and validated several approaches and selected the most reliable RT-PCR protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patients routine diagnostic formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens available in pathology, to assess a) organ tropism in samples from COVID-19-positive patients, b) unrecognized cases in selected tissues from negative or not-tested patients during a pandemic peak, and c) retrospectively, pre-pandemic lung samples.

We identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in four samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients, in two gastric biopsies, one colon resection, and one pleural effusion specimen, while all other specimens, particularly from patients with mild COVID-19 disease course, were negative. In the pandemic peak cohort, we identified one previously unrecognized COVID-19 case in tonsillectomy samples. All pre-pandemic lung samples were negative.

In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in FFPE pathology specimens can potentially improve surveillance of COVID-19, allow retrospective studies, and advance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 organ tropism and effects.","Von Stillfried, S.

The increase in sick leave was prolonged for women aged 45-70 years only, persisting for up to 4 months after testing positive (relative increase = 35%, B=0.010, 95% CI=0.004-0.035).

ConclusionSick leave following COVID-19 is elevated for up to two to four months after initial infection, thereafter not elevated compared with employees who tested negative for COVID-19. Women aged 45-70 years tend to have a larger impact of COVID-19 on their work ability than men and younger women.","Skyrud, K. D.; Telle, K. E.; Hernaes, K.

6287,"A new role for Biofoundries in rapid prototyping, development, and validation of automated clinical diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown how the rapid rise in demand for patient and community sample testing, required for tracing and containing a highly infectious disease, has quickly overwhelmed testing capability globally. With most diagnostic infrastructure dependent on specialised instruments, their exclusive reagent supplies quickly become bottlenecks in times of peak demand, creating an urgent need for novel approaches to boost testing capacity. We address this challenge by refocusing the full synthetic biology stack available at the London Biofoundry onto the development of alternative patient sample testing pipelines. We present a reagent-agnostic automated SARS-CoV-2 testing platform that can be quickly deployed and scaled, and that accepts a diverse range of reagents. Using an in-house-generated, open-source, MS2-virus-like-particle-SARS-CoV-2 standard, we validate RNA extraction and RT-qPCR workflows as well as two novel detection assays based on CRISPR-Cas and Loop-mediated isothermal Amplification (LAMP) approaches. In collaboration with an NHS diagnostic testing lab, we report the performance of the overall workflow and benchmark SARS-CoV-2 detection in patient samples via RT-qPCR, CRISPR-Cas, and LAMP against clinical test sets. The validated RNA extraction and RT-qPCR platform has been installed in NHS diagnostic labs with a testing capacity of 1000 samples per day and now contributes to increased patient sample processing in the UK while we continue to refine and develop novel high-throughput diagnostic methods. Finally, our workflows and protocols can be quickly implemented and adapted by members of the Global Biofoundry Alliance and the wider scientific and medical diagnostics community.","Crone, M.

12005,Statistical analysis of national & municipal corporation level database of COVID-19 cases In India,"Since its origin in December 2019, Novel Coronavirus or COVID-19 has caused massive panic in the word by infecting millions of people with a varying fatality rate. The main objective of Governments worldwide is to control the extent of the outbreak until a vaccine or cure has been devised. Machine learning has been an efficient mechanism to train, map, analyze, and predict datasets. This paper aims to utilize regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm to assess time-series datasets of COVID-19 pandemic by performing comparative analysis on datasets of India and two Municipal Corporations of Maharashtra, namely, Mira-Bhayander and Akola. Current study is an attempt towards drawing attention to the dynamics and nature of the pandemic in a controlled locality such as Municipal Corporation; which differs from the exponential nature observed nationally. However, for limited area like the one considered the nature of curve is observed to be cubic for total cases and multi-peak Gaussian for active cases. In conclusion, Government should empower district/ corporations/local authorities to adopt their own methodology and decision-making policy to contain the pandemic at regional-level like the case study discussed herein.","Bajaj, N.

11896,The risk of severe COVID-19: hospital and ICU admission rates in Norway,"BackgroundEpidemiological studies of COVID-19 with population based information may add to the knowledge needed to prioritise resources and advice on how restrictive measures should be targeted. This study provides admission rates to hospitals and intensive care units (ICU) in Norway, aiming to better understand the risk of severe COVID-19 infection.

MethodsData from official reports from The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) and the Norwegian Directorate of Health were used to calculate admission rates to hospitals and to ICU per 100 000 inhabitants. We compared rates of hospitalisation between the four health regions and provide separate rates for Oslo. We also assessed national admissions to ICU stratified by age.

ResultsThe admission rate in the south-eastern region was 3.1 per 100 000, and the rate for Oslo was 5.8. Compared to the western region (reference), the Oslo rate was 4.0 times (confidence interval (CI) 3.0-5.5) higher. In Norway as a whole, the rate of ICU admissions was 3.9 per 100 000, and in the age groups 60-69 and 70-79, ICU rates were 10.3 and 11.5, respectively. These rates were 9.5 (CI 6.3-14.3) and 10.6 (CI 6.9-16.2) times higher compared to people younger than 50 years.

ConclusionHospital admissions due to Covid-19 are much higher in Oslo than anywhere else in Norway, and in the country as a whole, ICU admissions are highest among people 60-79 years of age. These results and more detailed data could provide better advice on how restrictions can be safely lessened.","Munkvik, M.; Vatten Alsnes, I.; Vatten, L.",2020-07-18,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.16.20155358,1,Morten Munkvik,University of Stavanger,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155358v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155358v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
3135,Global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2: from outbreak to pandemic,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is straining health systems around the world. Although the Chinese government implemented a number of severe restrictions on peoples movement in an attempt to contain its local and international spread, the virus had already reached many areas of the world in part due to its potent transmissibility and the fact that a substantial fraction of infected individuals develop little or no symptoms at all. Following its emergence, the virus started to generate sustained transmission in neighboring countries in Asia, Western Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States, and finally in South America and Africa. As the virus continues its global spread, a clear and evidence-based understanding of properties and dynamics of the global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to design and put in place efficient and globally coordinated interventions.

MethodsWe employ molecular surveillance data of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics for inference and comprehensive analysis of its global transmission network before the pandemic declaration. Our goal was to characterize the spatial-temporal transmission pathways that led to the establishment of the pandemic. We exploited a network-based approach specifically tailored to emerging outbreak settings. Specifically, it traces the accumulation of mutations in viral genomic variants via mutation trees, which are then used to infer transmission networks, revealing an up-to-date picture of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 between and within countries and geographic regions.

Results and ConclusionsThe analysis suggest multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the majority of world regions by means of heterogeneous transmission pathways. The transmission network is scale-free, with a few genomic variants responsible for the majority of possible transmissions. The network structure is in line with the available temporal information represented by sample collection times and suggest the expected sampling time difference of few days between potential transmission pairs. The inferred network structural properties, transmission clusters and pathways and virus introduction routes emphasize the extent of the global epidemiological linkage and demonstrate the importance of internationally coordinated public health measures.","Skums, P.; Kirpich, A.; Icer Baykal, P.; Zelikovsky, A.; Chowell, G.",2020-03-27,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.22.20041145,1,Pavel Skums,Georgia State University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041145v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041145v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"

We analyzed autopsy specimens from 24 patients who succumbed to SARS-CoV-2 infection using a combination of different RNA and protein analytical platforms to characterize inter- and intra-patient heterogeneity of pulmonary virus infection. There was a spectrum of high and low virus cases that was associated with duration of disease and activation of interferon pathway genes. Using a digital spatial profiling platform, the virus corresponded to distinct spatial expression of interferon response genes and immune checkpoint genes demonstrating the intra-pulmonary heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Desai, N.; Neyaz, A.; Szabolcs, A.; Shih, A.

In March 2020, we launched the CHASING COVID Cohort Study, a national, community-based prospective cohort study of 6,745 U.S. adults who underwent at-home specimen collection for repeat serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We identify and quantify several policy-sensitive risk factors for recent SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion, highlight persistent racial/ethnic disparities in incidence, document continued elevated risk among essential workers, and call attention to major gaps in the coverage of public health interventions aimed at testing, isolation, and contact tracing.

13772,Convalescent plasma for patients with severe COVID-19: a matched cohort study,"BackgroundThe efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) for the treatment of COVID-19 remains unclear.

MethodsA matched cohort analysis of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. The impact of CP treatment on all cause in-hospital mortality was evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards models, and the impact of CP treatment on the time to hospital discharge was assessed using a stratified log-rank analysis.

Results64 patients who received CP a median of 7 days after symptom onset were compared to a matched control group of 177 patients. Overall in-hospital mortality was 14.9%. There was no significant difference in the risk of in-hospital mortality between the two groups (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39 - 2.20). There was also no significant difference in the overall rate of hospital discharge (rate ratio [RR] 1.28, 95% CI 0.91 - 1.81), but a subgroup analysis of patients 65-years-old or greater who received CP demonstrated a significantly increased hospital discharge rate among these patients (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.03 - 3.36). There was a greater than expected frequency of transfusion reactions in the CP group (2.8% reaction rate observed per unit transfused).

ConclusionsThe use of CP in this study was a safe treatment for COVID-19. There was no overall significant reduction of in-hospital mortality or increased rate of hospital discharge associated with the use of CP in this study, although there was a signal for improved outcomes among the elderly. Further adequately powered randomized studies should target this subgroup when assessing the efficacy CP treatment.","Rogers, R.; Shehadeh, F.; Mylona, E.; Rich, J.; Neill, M.; Touzard-Romo, F.; Geffert, S.; Larkin, J.; Bailey, J.

5902,Modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for COVID-19: results from UK Biobank,"BackgroundInformation on risk factors for COVID-19 is sub-optimal. We investigated demographic, lifestyle, socioeconomic, and clinical risk factors, and compared them to risk factors for pneumonia and influenza in UK Biobank.

MethodsUK Biobank recruited 37-70 year olds in 2006-2010 from the general population. The outcome of confirmed COVID-19 infection (positive SARS-CoV-2 test) was linked to baseline UK Biobank data. Incident influenza and pneumonia were obtained from primary care data. Poisson regression was used to study the association of exposure variables with outcomes.

FindingsAmong 428,225 participants, 340 had confirmed COVID-19. After multivariable adjustment, modifiable risk factors were higher body mass index (RR 1.24 per SD increase), smoking (RR 1.38), slow walking pace as a proxy for physical fitness (RR 1.66) and use of blood pressure medications as a proxy for hypertension (RR 1.40). Non-modifiable risk factors included older age (RR 1.10 per 5 years), male sex (RR 1.64), black ethnicity (RR 1.86), socioeconomic deprivation (RR 1.26 per SD increase in Townsend Index), longstanding illness (RR 1.38) and high cystatin C (RR 1.24 per 1 SD increase). The risk factors overlapped with pneumonia somewhat; less so for influenza. The associations with modifiable risk factors were generally stronger for COVID-19, than pneumonia or influenza.

InterpretationThese findings suggest that modification of lifestyle may help to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and could be a useful adjunct to other interventions, such as social distancing and shielding of high risk.

We conducted a cross-sectional study assaying the IgG and IgM antibodies in 1331 individuals with ocular diseases by using a magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay kit, during the period from February 2020 to May 2020. In our study, the seroposivity in total ocular disease patients was 0.83% (11/1331). The patients with different ocular diseases including xerophthalmia, keratitis, conjunctival cyst, cataract, glaucoma, refractive error, strabismus and others had seroposivity of 2.94%, 12.5%, 25%, 4.41%, 2.63%, 1.6%, 2.22% and 0%, respectively. Among that, two ocular surface disease groups (keratitis and conjunctival cyst) had higher seroprevalence compared with others. All the participants were reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction negative for SARS-CoV-2 from throat swabs. Our study evaluated the seroprevalence in patients with different ocular diseases, which will help us understand the relationship between ocular disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

20481,Efficiency of Artificial Intelligence in Detecting COVID-19 Pneumonia and Other Pneumonia Causes by Quantum Fourier Transform Method,"The new coronavirus (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan in December 2019 and has been announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Currently, this deadly pandemic has caused more than 1 million deaths worldwide. Therefore, it is essential to detect positive cases as early as possible to prevent the further spread of this outbreak. Currently, the most widely used COVID-19 detection technique is a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, RT-PCR is time-consuming to confirm infection in the patient. Because RT-PCR is less sensitive, it provides high false-negative results. Computed tomography (CT) is recommended as a solution to this problem by healthcare professionals because of its higher sensitivity for early and rapid diagnosis. In addition, radiation used in CT poses a serious threat to patients. In this study, we propose a CNN-based method to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other types of viral and bacterial pneumonia using low-dose CT images to reduce the radiation dose used in CT. In our study, we used a data set consisting of 7717 CT images of 350 patients that we collected from Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University Research Hospital. We used a CNN-based network that suppresses noise to remove interference from low-dose CT images. In the image preprocessing phase, we provided lung segmentation from CT images and applied quantum Fourier transform. By evaluating all possible variations of local knowledge at the same time with quantum Fourier transformation, the most informative spatial information was extracted. In CNN-based architecture, we used pre-trained ResNet50v2 as a feature extractor and fine-tune by training with our dataset. We visualized the efficiency of the ResNet50v2 network using the t-SNE method. We performed the classification process with a fully connected layer. We created a heat map using the GradCam technique to see where the model focuses on the images while classifying. In this experimental study, the results of 99.5%, 99.2%, 99.0%, 99.7%, and 99.1%, were obtained in the context of performance criteria such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and f1 score, respectively.

11692,Higher Comorbidities and Early Death is Characteristic of Hospitalized African-American Patients with COVID-19,"BackgroundAfrican-Americans/Blacks have suffered higher morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 than all other racial groups. This study aims to identify the causes of this health disparity, determine prognostic indicators, and assess efficacy of treatment interventions.

MethodWe performed a retrospective cohort study of clinical features and laboratory data of COVID-19 patients admitted over a five-week period at the height of the pandemic in the United States. This study was performed at an urban academic medical center in New York City, declared a COVID-only facility, serving a majority Black population

ResultOf the 1,070 consecutive patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 496 critically ill patients were hospitalized and included in the study. 88% of patients were Black; and a majority (53%) were 61-80 years old with a mean body mass index in the """"obese"""" range. 97% had one or more comorbidities. Hypertension was the most common (84%) pre-existing condition followed by diabetes mellitus (57%) and chronic kidney disease (24%). Patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease who received hemodialysis were found to have significantly lower mortality, then those who did not receive it, suggesting benefit from hemodialysis (11%, OR, 0.35, CI, 0.17 - 0.69 P=0.001). Age >60 years and coronary artery disease were independent predictors of mortality in multivariate analysis. Cox Proportional Hazards modeling for time to death demonstrated a significantly high ratio for COPD/Asthma, and favorable effects on outcomes for pre-admission ACE inhibitors and ARBs. CRP (180, 283 mg/L), LDH (551, 638 U/L), glucose (182, 163 mg/dL), procalcitonin (1.03, 1.68 ng/mL), and neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio (8.5, 10.0) were predictive of mortality on admission and at 48-96 hrs. Of the 496 inpatients, 48% died, one third of patients died within the first three days of admission. 54/488 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, of which 87% died and of the remaining patients, 32% died.

CONCLUSIONSCOVID-19 patients in our predominantly Black neighborhood had higher mortality, likely due to higher prevalence of comorbidities. Early dialysis and pre-admission intake of ACE inhibitors/ARBs improved patient outcomes. Early escalation of care based on comorbidities and key laboratory indicators is critical for improving outcomes in African-American patients.","Gupta, R.; Agrawal, R.; Bukhari, Z.; Jabbar, A.; Wang, D.; Diks, J.; Alshal, M.; Emechebe, D.

22007,Diagnostic performance of standard and inverted grey-scale CXR in detection of lung lesions in COVID-19 patients. A single institution study in the region of Abu Dhabi.,"PurposeTo evaluate diagnostic performance of greyscale and inverted greyscale Chest X-ray (CXR) using Computed Tomography (CT) scan as a gold standard.

MethodsIn this retrospective study, electronic medical records of 120 patients who had valid CXR and High-resolution CT (HRCT) within less than 24 hours after having a positive COVID-19 RT-PCR test during the period from May 19 th to May 23 rd 2020 in a single tertiary care center were reviewed.

PA chest radiographs were presented on 2 occasions to 5 radiologists to evaluate the role and appropriateness of greyscale and inverted greyscale chest radiographs (CXR). The images were viewed on high-specification viewing systems using a primary display monitors and compared it to computed tomography (CT) findings for screening and management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.

ResultsNinety-six (80%) patients had positive CT findings, 81 (67.5%) had positive grey scale CXR lesions, and 25 (20.8%) had better detection in the inverted grey scale CXR. The CXR sensitivity for COVID-19 pneumonia was 93.8% (95% CI (86.2% - 98.0%) and the specificity was 48.7% (95% CI (32.4% - 65.2%). The CXR sensitivity of detection of lung lesions was slightly higher in male (95.1% (95% CI (86.3% - 99.0%)) than female (90.0% (95% CI (68.3% - 98.8%)), while the specificity was 48.0% (95% CI (27.8% - 68.7%) and 50.0% (95% CI (23.0% - 77.0%) in males and females, respectively. However, no significant difference was detected in ROC area between men and women.

ConclusionsThe sensitivity of detection of lung lesions of CXR was relatively high, particularly in men. The results of the study support the idea of considering conventional radiographs as an important diagnostic tool in suspected COVID-19 patients especially in healthcare facilities where there is no access to HRCT scans.

26482,Methotrexate Hampers Immunogenicity to BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine in Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Disease,"ObjectiveTo investigate the humoral and cellular immune response to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) on immunomodulatory treatment.

MethodsEstablished patients at NYU Langone Health with IMID (n=51) receiving the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination were assessed at baseline and after second immunization. Healthy subjects served as controls (n=26). IgG antibody responses to the spike protein were analyzed for humoral response. Cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 was further analyzed using high-parameter spectral flow cytometry. A second independent, validation cohort of controls (n=182) and patients with IMID (n=31) from Erlangen, Germany were also analyzed for humoral immune response.

ResultsAlthough healthy subjects (n=208) and IMID patients on biologic treatments (mostly on TNF blockers, n=37) demonstrate robust antibody responses (over 90%), those patients with IMID on background methotrexate (n=45) achieve an adequate response in only 62.2% of cases. Similarly, IMID patients do not demonstrate an increase in CD8+ T cell activation after vaccination.

ConclusionsIn two independent cohorts of IMID patients, methotrexate, a widely used immunomodulator for the treatment of several IMIDs, adversely affected humoral and cellular immune response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Although precise cut offs for immunogenicity that correlate with vaccine efficacy are yet to be established, our findings suggest that different strategies may need to be explored in patients with IMID taking methotrexate to increase the chances of immunization efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 as has been demonstrated for augmenting immunogenicity to other viral vaccines.

KEY MESSAGESO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about this subject?C_ST_ABSO_LIThe impact of COVID-19 has been felt across the globe and new hope has arisen with the approval of mRNA vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown immunogenicity and efficacy rates of over 90% in the immunocompetent adult population. However, there is a lack of knowledge surrounding the response of patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) who may also be on immunomodulatory medications.
C_LIO_LIPatients with IMID have been shown to have attenuated immune responses to seasonal influenza vaccination.
C_LI

What does this study add?O_LIThis study looks at the humoral and cellular immune response to two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine in participants with IMID (on immunomodulators) compared with healthy controls.
C_LIO_LIIndividuals with IMID on methotrexate demonstrate up to a 62% reduced rate of adequate immunogenicity to the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. Those on anti-cytokine or non-methotrexate oral medications demonstrate similar levels of immunogenicity as healthy controls (greater than 90%).
C_LIO_LISimilarly, vaccination did not induce an activated CD8+ T cell response in participants on background methotrexate, unlike healthy controls and patients with IMID not receiving methotrexate.
C_LI

How might this impact of clinical practice or future developments?O_LIThese results suggest that patients on methotrexate may need alternate vaccination strategies such as additional doses of vaccine, dose modification of methotrexate, or even a temporary discontinuation of this drug. Further studies will be required to explore the effect of these approaches on mRNA vaccine immunogenicity.

3577,Rapid and accurate identification of COVID-19 infection through machine learning based on clinical available blood test results,"Since the sudden outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it has rapidly evolved into a momentous global health concern. Due to the lack of constructive information on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and specific treatment, it highlights the importance of early diagnosis and timely treatment. In this study, 11 key blood indices were extracted through random forest algorithm to build the final assistant discrimination tool from 49 clinical available blood test data which were derived by commercial blood test equipments. The method presented robust outcome to accurately identify COVID-19 from a variety of suspected patients with similar CT information or similar symptoms, with accuracy of 0.9795 and 0.9697 for the cross-validation set and test set, respectively. The tool also demonstrated its outstanding performance on an external validation set that was completely independent of the modeling process, with sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of 0.9512, 0.9697, and 0.9595, respectively. Besides, 24 samples from overseas infected patients with COVID-19 were used to make an in-depth clinical assessment with accuracy of 0.9167. After multiple verification, the reliability and repeatability of the tool has been fully evaluated, and it has the potential to develop into an emerging technology to identify COVID-19 and lower the burden of global public health. The proposed tool is well-suited to carry out preliminary assessment of suspected patients and help them to get timely treatment and quarantine suggestion. The assistant tool is now available online at http://lishuyan.lzu.edu.cn/COVID2019_2/.

7799,Risk Factors for COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 related in-hospital and community deaths by Local Authority District in Great Britain,"ObjectivesTo undertake a preliminary hypothesis-generating analysis exploring putative risk factors for coronavirus diseae 2019 (COVID-19) population-adjusted deaths, compared with non-COVID-19 related deaths, at a local authority district (LAD) level in hospital, care homes and at home.

DesignEcological retrospective cohort study

SettingLocal authority districts (LADs) in England, Scotland and Wales (Great Britain (GB)).

ParticipantsAll LAD deaths registered by week 16 of 2020.

Main Outcome MeasuresDeath registration where COVID-19 is mentioned as a contributing factor per 100,000 people in all settings, and in i) cares homes, ii) hospitals or iii) home only, in comparison to non-COVID-19 related deaths.

ResultsAcross GB by week 16 of 2020, 20,684 deaths had been registered mentioning COVID-19, equivalent to 25.6 per 100,000 people. Significant risk factors for LAD COVID-19 death in comparison to non-COVID-19 related death were air pollution and proportion of the population who were female. Significant protective factors were higher air temperature and proportion of the population who were ex-smokers. Conversely, for all COVID-19 unrelated deaths in comparison to COVID-19 deaths, higher rates of communal living, higher population rates of chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease deaths under 75 and dementia were predictive of death, whereas, higher rates of flight passengers was protective. Looking at individual setttings, the most notable findings in care homes was Scotland being a significant risk factor for COVID-19 related deaths compared to England. For hospital setting, the proportion of the population who were from black and Asian minority ethnic (BAME) groups significantly predicted COVID-19 related death.

ConclusionsThis is the first study within GB to assess COVID-19 related deaths in comparison to COVID-19 unrelated deaths across hospital, care homes and home combined. As an ecological study, the results cannot be directly extrapolated to individuals. However, the analysis may be informative for public health policy and protective measures. From our hypothesis-generating analysis, we propose that air pollution is a significant risk factor and high temperature a significant protective factor for COVID-19 related deaths. These factors cannot readily be modelled at an individual level. Scottish local authorities and local authorities with a higher proportion of individuals of BAME origin are potential risk factors for COVID-19 related deaths in care homes and in hospitals, respectively. Altogether, this analysis shows the benefits of access to high quality open data for public information, public health policy and further research.","Leighton, S. P.; Leighton, D.

25489,The relationship between human mobility measures and SAR-Cov-2 transmission varies by epidemic phase and urbanicity: results from the United States,"Global efforts to prevent the spread of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic in early 2020 focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions like social distancing; policies that aim to reduce transmission by changing mixing patterns between people. As countries have implemented these interventions, aggregated location data from mobile phones have become an important source of real-time information about human mobility and behavioral changes on a population level. Human activity measured using mobile phones reflects the aggregate behavior of a subset of people, and although metrics of mobility are related to contact patterns between people that spread the coronavirus, they do not provide a direct measure. In this study, we use results from a nowcasting approach from 1,396 counties across the US between January 22nd, 2020 and July 9th, 2020 to determine the effective reproductive number (R(t)) along an urban/rural gradient. For each county, we compare the time series of R(t) values with mobility proxies from mobile phone data from Camber Systems, an aggregator of mobility data from various providers in the United States. We show that the reproduction number is most strongly associated with mobility proxies for change in the travel into counties compared to baseline, but that the relationship weakens considerably after the initial 15 weeks of the epidemic, consistent with the emergence of a more complex ecosystem of local policies and behaviors including masking. Importantly, we highlight potential issues in the data generation process, representativeness and equity of access which must be addressed to allow for general use of these data in public health.","Kishore, N.; Taylor, A.

22671,Estimating the Failure Risk of Quarantine Systems for Preventing COVID-19 Outbreaks in Australia and New Zealand,"ObjectivesTo identify COVID-19 outbreaks and border control failures associated with quarantine systems in Australia and New Zealand and to estimate the failure risks.

Design, setting, participantsObservational epidemiological study of travellers transiting quarantine in Australia and New Zealand up to 15 June 2021.

Main outcome measuresThe incidence of COVID-19 related failures arising from quarantine, and the failure risk for those transiting quarantine, estimated both per 100,000 travellers and per 1000 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases.

ResultsAustralia and New Zealand had 32 COVID-19 related failures arising from quarantine systems up to 15 June 2021 (22 and 10, respectively). One resultant outbreak involved an estimated 800 deaths and quarantine failures instigated nine lockdowns. The failure risk for those transiting quarantine was estimated at 5.0 failures per 100,000 travellers and 6.1 failures (95%CI: 4.0 to 8.3) per 1000 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases. The latter risk was two-fold higher in New Zealand compared with Australia. The full vaccination of frontline border workers could likely have prevented a number of quarantine system failures.

ConclusionsQuarantine system failures can be costly in terms of lives and economic impacts such as lockdowns. Ongoing improvements or alternatives to hotel-based quarantine are required.","Grout, L.

22731,SARS-CoV-2 infection drives a glycan switch of peripheral T cells at diagnosis,"COVID-19 is a highly selective disease in which SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in different clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic/mild to severe disease that requires hospitalization. Here, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a glycosylation reprogramming of circulating lymphocytes at diagnosis. We identified a specific glycosignature of T cells, defined upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and apparently triggered by a serological factor. This specific glycan switch of T cells is detected at diagnosis being more pronounced in asymptomatic patients. We further demonstrated that asymptomatic patients display an increased expression of a viral-sensing receptor, through the up-regulation of DC-SIGN in monocytes. We showed that higher levels of DC-SIGN in monocytes at diagnosis correlates with better COVID-19 prognosis. These new evidences pave the way to the identification of a novel glycan-based response in T cells that may confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic patients, highlighting a novel prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target.","Alves, I.; Vicente, M.

18189,Universal Health Coverage and COVID-19 Pandemic: A Bangladesh Perspective,"BackgroundLike many other countries around the world, Bangladesh adopts Universal Health Coverage (UHC) as a national aspiration. The central theme of its providing quality and affordable health services which is a significant element of social protection. This paper was aimed to provide a narrative understanding of the perspectives of UHC in Bangladesh towards COVID-19 based on the existing literature.

MethodsWe conducted a review combining articles and abstracts with full HTML and PDF format. We searched Google Scholar, ScienceDirect and Google using multiple terms related to UHC, COVID-19 and Bangladesh without any date boundary and without any basis of types of studies, that is, all types of studies were scrutinized.

ResultsThis short description highlights that the current pandemic COVID-19 holds lessons that health systems and economies in several countries like Bangladesh are not in enough preparation to tackle a massive public health crisis. It reports the shortage of health workers, scarcity of personal protective equipment, limited and ineffective diagnostic facilities, inadequate infrastructure of health care facilities, scarcity of drugs, and underfunded health services. Further, COVID-19 pandemic highlights the countrys health system needs an ongoing rehab post-COVID-19 with strong coordination in governance, in health economics, in health systems, in information systems, as well as in community participation in health to achieve UHC.

ConclusionsAddressing the needs for UHC achievement, it is important to break down the access barriers and keeping up to date all the activities addressing public health crisis like COVID-19.","Ferdous, M.

22374,"Responsive caregiving, opportunities for early learning, and children's safety and security during COVID-19: A rapid review","IntroductionDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been drastic changes in family life and programs and services that promote and protect early childhood development. Global stakeholders have raised concerns that the pandemic is putting enormous strain on parents and other caregivers, compromising capabilities and enabling environments for nurturing care of young children and therefore likely impacting childrens development.

MethodologyThis rapid review takes stock of emerging research on nurturing care for young children during the COVID-19 crisis. Two databases were searched in addition to an extensive search for grey literature, drawing on 112 scholarly and scientific studies from more than 30 countries that have examined components of nurturing care during the pandemic, namely: responsive caregiving, early learning and play, and childrens safety and security.

ResultsThere are some reports of unexpected positive benefits of the pandemic on families, including increased father involvement in caregiving. But more commonly, the studies findings reveal numerous issues of concern, including parental and caregiver mental health difficulties and less responsive parent-child relationships, increased screen time among children, limited opportunities for outdoor play, and fractured systems for responding to potential child neglect and maltreatment. Evidence suggests limited access and challenges in the provision of remote learning for the youngest learners, such as those in early childhood education.

ConclusionThe findings can inform global stakeholders, who have advocated for increased support and funding to ensure young children and other caregivers are supported and protected during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need for action-oriented implementation studies - those that go beyond identifying trends and begin to pinpoint """"what works"""" to effectively promote and protect nurturing care during emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Key questionsO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABSThe most fundamental promotive experiences in the early years of life to reach optimal development come from nurturing care and protection received from parents, family, and community, which have lifelong benefits including improved health and wellbeing. Health and other emergencies are detrimental to the provision of nurturing care.

What are the new findings?Findings from this rapid review reveal numerous areas of concern, including families reporting mental health difficulties and less responsive parent-child relationships, increased screen time among children, limited opportunities for outdoor play, and fractured systems for responding to potential child neglect and maltreatment. As with other features of this pandemic, not all families are affected equally: financially vulnerable families are much more likely to experience negative ramifications. The pandemic is also disproportionately affecting parents and other caregivers with young children, particularly mothers, those with pre-existing mental health difficulties, and those caring for children with disabilities.

What do the new findings imply?Findings highlight the need for action by governments, civil society, international and community-based organizations to improve support for families so that the pandemic does not break the provision of nurturing care and wipe out decades of progress, especially for vulnerable families and children.","Proulx, K.; Lenzi-Weisbecker, R.; Rachel, R.; Hackett, K.; Cavallera, V.; Daelmans, B.; Dua, T.",2021-02-16,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.02.10.21251507,1,Kerrie Proulx,FHI360,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.10.21251507v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.10.21251507v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
11513,"COVID-19 incidence and R decreased on the Isle of Wight after the launch of the Test, Trace, Isolate programme","In May 2020 the UK introduced a Test, Trace, Isolate programme in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The programme was first rolled out on the Isle of Wight and included Version 1 of the NHS contact tracing app. We used COVID-19 daily case data to infer incidence of new infections and estimate the reproduction number R for each of 150 Upper Tier Local Authorities in England, and at the National level, before and after the launch of the programme on the Isle of Wight. We used Bayesian and Maximum-Likelihood methods to estimate R, and compared the Isle of Wight to other areas using a synthetic control method. We observed significant decreases in incidence and R on the Isle of Wight immediately after the launch. These results are robust across each of our approaches. Our results show that the sub-epidemic on the Isle of Wight was controlled significantly more effectively than the sub-epidemics of most other Upper Tier Local Authorities, changing from having the third highest reproduction number R (of 150) before the intervention to the tenth lowest afterwards. The data is not yet available to establish a causal link. However, the findings highlight the need for further research to determine the causes of this reduction, as these might translate into local and national non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies in the period before a treatment or vaccination becomes available.","Kendall, M.; Milsom, L.; Abeler-Dorner, L.; Wymant, C.; Ferretti, L.; Briers, M.; Holmes, C.; Bonsall, D.; Abeler, J.; Fraser, C.",2020-07-14,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.12.20151753,1,Michelle Kendall,University of Oxford,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.12.20151753v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.12.20151753v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/S2589-7500(20)30241-7

However, Impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD center and HD patients have not been reported.

ObjectiveTo summery an outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic in HD center.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe reviewed the epidemic course from the first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 infection on January 14 to the control of the epidemic on March 12 in the HD center of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. Total 230 HD patients and 33 medical staff were included in this study

ExposuresCOVID-19.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresEpidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and outcomes data were collected and analyzed. 19 COVID-19 HD patients, 19 non-COVID-19 HD patients and 19 healthy volunteers were enrolled for further study about the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on host immune responses.

Results42 out of 230 HD patients (18.26%) and 4 out of 33 medical staffs (12.12%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 from the outbreak to March 12, 2020. 13 HD patients (5.65%), including 10 COVID-19 diagnosed, died during the epidemic. Only 2 deaths of the COVID-19 HD patients were associated with pneumonia/lung failure. Except 3 patients were admitted to ICU for severe condition (8.11%), including 2 dead, most COVID-19 diagnosed patients presented mild or none-respiratory symptoms. Multiple lymphocyte populations in HD patients were significantly decreased. HD patients with COVID-19 even displayed more remarkable reduction of serum inflammatory cytokines than other COVID-19 patients.

Conclusions and RelevanceHD patients are the highly susceptible population and HD centers are high risk area during the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. HD Patients with COVID-19 are mostly clinical mild and unlikely progress to severe pneumonia due to the impaired cellular immune function and incapability of mounting cytokines storm. More attention should be paid to prevent cardiovascular events, which may be the collateral impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD patients.","Ma, Y.; Diao, B.; Lv, X.; Zhu, J.; Liang, W.; Liu, L.; Bu, W.; Cheng, H.; Zhang, S.; Yang, L.; Shi, M.; Ding, G.; Shen, B.; Wang, H.",2020-06-17,Nephrology,10.1101/2020.02.24.20027201,3,Huiming Wang,"Department of Nephrology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027201v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027201v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
20377,Unraveling COVID-19-related hospital costs: The impact of clinical and demographic conditions,"IntroductionAlthough patients clinical conditions were previously shown to be associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and outcomes, their impact on hospital costs is not known. The economic evaluation of COVID-19 admissions allows the assessment of hospital costs associated with the treatment of these patients, including the main cost components and costs driven by demographic and clinical conditions. The aim of this study was to determine the COVID-19 hospitalization-related costs and their association with clinical conditions.

MethodsProspective observational cohort study of the hospitalization costs of patients with COVID-19 admitted between March 30 and June 30, 2020, who were followed until discharge, death, or external transfer, using micro-costing methodology. The study was carried out in the Central Institute of the Hospital das Clinicas, affiliated with the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, which is the largest hospital complex in Latin America and was designated to exclusively admit COVID-19 patients during the pandemic response.

ResultsThe average cost of the 3,254 admissions (51.7% of which involved intensive care unit (ICU) stays) was US$12,637.42. Overhead cost was the main cost component, followed by daily fixed costs and drugs. Sex, age and underlying hypertension (US$14,746.77), diabetes (US$15,002.12), obesity (US$18,941.55), cancer (US$10,315.06), chronic renal failure (US$15,377.84), and rheumatic (US$17,764.61), hematologic (US$15,908.25) and neurologic diseases (US$15,257.95) were significantly associated with higher costs. Age >69 years, RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19, comorbidities, the use of mechanical ventilation, dialysis, or surgery, and poor outcomes remained significantly associated with higher costs after model adjustment.

ConclusionKnowledge of COVID-19-associated hospital costs and their impact across different populations can aid in the development of a generalizable and comprehensive approach to hospital preparedness, decision-making and planning for future risk management. Determining the disease-associated costs is the first step in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of treatments and vaccination programs.

SUMMARY BOXO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the COVID-19 hospitalization-related costs?

FindingsIn this prospective cohort that was carried out in a single reference quaternary center designated for the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19, more than three thousand patients were included, and their costs of hospitalization were found to be directly related to the age and comorbidities. The costs were more than 50% higher in older patients, 10-24% higher in patients with comorbidities, and 24-200% higher when additional therapeutic procedures were required.

MeaningDetermining the disease-associated costs is the first step in conducting future evaluations of the cost-effectiveness of treatments and vaccination programs, supporting their implementation with a comprehensive population-based approach.","Anna Miethke-Morais, A.; Cassenote, A.; Piva, H.; Tokunaga, E.; Cobello, V.; Alves, F.

We found that compared to COVIDneg at the time of clinical presentation and diagnostic testing, COVIDpos patients tended to have higher plasma fibrinogen levels and similarly low platelet counts, with approximately 25% of patients in both cohorts showing outright thrombocytopenia. However, these measures show opposite longitudinal trends as the infection evolves, with declining fibrinogen and increasing platelet counts to levels that are lower and higher compared to the COVIDneg cohort, respectively. Our EHR augmented curation efforts suggest a minority of patients develop thromboembolic events after the PCR testing date, including rare cases with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), with most patients lacking the platelet reductions typically observed in consumptive coagulopathies. These temporal trends present, for the first time, fine-grained resolution of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC), via a digital framework that synthesizes longitudinal lab measurements with structured medication data and neural network-powered extraction of outcomes from the unstructured EHR. This study demonstrates how a precision medicine platform can help contextualize each patients specific coagulation profile over time, towards the goal of informing better personalization of thromboprophylaxis regimen.","Pawlowski, C.; Wagner, T.; Puranik, A.; Murugadoss, K.; Loscalzo, L.; Venkatakrishnan, A.; Pruthi, R.

COVID-19 vaccine was allocated in a phased roll-out beginning December 14, 2020. Phase 1A included health care personnel with direct patient contact, and residents and staff of nursing homes (NHs) and assisted living facilities (ALFs). Following this initial phase, individuals 65 years of age and older became eligible for vaccination, along with individuals determined by hospital providers to be extremely medically vulnerable to COVID-19. This strategy was based on the desire to most immediately reduce morbidity and mortality, as COVID-19 morbidity and mortality is age-related. Through March 15, 2021, 4,338,099 individuals received COVID-19 vaccine, including 2,431,540 individuals who completed their vaccination series. Of all those vaccinated, 70% were 65 years of age and older, and 63% of those 65 years of age and older. Beginning February 1, 2021, the decline in the number of new cases per week became greater in those 65 years of age and older than those younger. By March 15, 2021, the number of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths per day for those 65 years of age and older relative to mid-January, were 82%, 80%, and 92% lower respectively. In comparison, the number of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths per day for those younger than 65 years of age were 70%, 60%, and 87% lower respectively. Reductions in rates in those 65 year of age and older, were thus greater than in those who were younger (p <0.01; Wilcoxon test). These data show that vaccination efforts directed at those 65 years of age and older results in accelerated rates of overall declines in COVID-19 hospitalizations and mortality.","Rivkees, S.; Roberson, S.; Blackmore, C.",2021-04-07,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.04.05.21254722,1,Scott Rivkees,Florida Department of Health,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.05.21254722v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.05.21254722v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
18244,SARS-CoV-2 serological tests can generate false positive results for samples from patients with chronic inflammatory diseases,"ObjectivesPatients with chronic inflammatory diseases are often treated with immunosuppressants and therefore are of particular concern during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Serological tests will improve our understanding of the infection and immunity in this population, unless the tests give false positive results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the specificity of SARS-Cov-2 serological assays with samples from patients with chronic inflammatory diseases collected before April 2019, thus defined as negative.

MethodsSamples from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS, n=10), rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n=47) with or without rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP2) and RF +/- systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n=10), were tested with 17 commercially available lateral flow assays (LFA), two ELISA kits and one in-house developed multiplex bead-based assay.

ResultsSix LFA and the in-house IgG assay gave the correct negative results for all samples. However, the majority of assays (n=13), gave false positive signal with samples from patients with RA and SLE. This was most notable in RF positive RA samples. MS samples did not give any false positive in any of the assays.

ConclusionThe majority of the verified serological assays were sensitive to interfering antibodies in samples from patients with chronic inflammatory diseases and therefore may have poor specificity in this context. For these patients, the risk of false positivity should be considered when interpreting results of the SARS-CoV-2 serological assays.","Kharlamova, N.; Dunn, N.; Bedri, S.

24867,Risk quantification for SARS-CoV-2 infection through airborne transmission in university settings,"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted learning as many institutions switched to remote or hybrid instruction. An in-depth assessment of the risk of infection that takes into account environmental setting and mitigation strategies is needed to make safe and informed decisions regarding reopening university spaces. A quantitative model of infection probability that accounts for space-specific parameters is presented to enable assessment of the risk in reopening university spaces at given densities. The model uses local positivity rate, room capacity, mask filtration efficiency, air exchange rate, room volume, and time spent in the space as parameters to calculate infection probabilities in teaching spaces, dining halls, dorms, and shared bathrooms. The model readily calculates infection probabilities in various university spaces, with mask filtration efficiency and air exchange rate being among the dominant variables. When applied to university spaces, this model demonstrated that, under specific conditions that are feasible to implement, in-person classes could be held in large lecture halls with an infection risk over the semester < 1%. Meal pick-ups from dining halls and the use of shared bathrooms in residential dormitories among small groups of students could also be accomplished with low risk. The results of applying this model to spaces at Harvard University (Cambridge and Allston campuses) and Stanford University are reported. Finally, a user-friendly web application was developed using this model to calculate infection probability following input of space-specific variables. The successful development of a quantitative model and its implementation through a web application may facilitate accurate assessments of infection risk in university spaces. In light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on universities, this tool could provide crucial insight to students, faculty, and university officials in making informed decisions.","Ambatipudi, M.; Carrillo Gonzalez, P.; Tasnim, K.; Daigle, J.; Kulyk, T.; Jeffreys, N.; Sule, N.; Trevino, R.; He, E.

8665,Respiratory Failure in Covid19 is associated with increased monocyte expression of complement receptor 3,"A key question in COVID-19 infection is why some previously healthy patients develop severe pulmonary failure and some ultimately die. Initial pulmonary failure does not exhibit classical features of ARDS; hypercoagulability is a common laboratory feature, and pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy has been reported post mortem1,2,3. Biomarkers cannot robustly identify such patients pre-emptively and no specific interventions exist to mitigate clinical deterioration. Mononuclear phagocytic cells are key immune cells and bind fibrinogen through the CD11b/CD18 dimer CR3, whose activated form can initiate microthrombus formation. Accordingly, we profiled circulating monocyte CD11b/CD18 cell surface density from COVID-19 infected adults who were (i) symptomatic but breathless, (ii) requiring ventilatory support, and (iii) recovering following ICU care for hypoxia.","Gupta, R.; Gant, V.

22617,Experiences of supported isolation in returning travellers during the early COVID-19 response: an interview study,"ObjectivesTo understand the experiences of those who underwent supported isolation as part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, after returning to the UK from Wuhan, China.

DesignWe used semi-structured interviews to capture participants experiences and perceptions of supported isolation.

SettingTelephone interviews carried out within approximately one month of an individual leaving supported isolation.

Participants26 people who underwent supported isolation at either Arrowe Park Hospital (n = 18) or Kents Hill Park Conference Centre (n = 8) after being repatriated from Wuhan in January - February 2020.

ResultsParticipants were willing to undergo supported isolation because they understood that it would protect themselves and others. Positive treatment by staff was fundamental to participants willingness to comply with isolation procedures. Despite the high level of compliance, participants expressed some uncertainty about what the process would involve.

ConclusionsAs hotel quarantine is introduced across the UK for international arrivals, our findings suggest that those in charge should: communicate effectively before, during and after quarantine, emphasising why quarantine is important and how it will protect others; avoid enforcement and focus on supporting and promoting voluntary compliance; facilitate shared social experiences for those in quarantine; and ensure all necessary supplies are provided. Doing so will increase adherence and reduce any negative effects on wellbeing.","Carter, H.; Weston, D.; Greenberg, N.; Oliver, I.; Robin, C.; Rubin, G.

16052,The Challenge of Forecasting Demand of Medical Resources and Supplies During a Pandemic: A Comparative Evaluation of Three Surge Calculators for COVID-19,"Ever since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic, there has been a public health debate concerning medical resources and supplies including hospital beds, intensive care units (ICU), ventilators, and Protective Personal Equipment (PPE). Forecasting COVID-19 dissemination has played a key role in informing healthcare professionals and governments on how to manage overburdened healthcare systems. However, forecasting during the pandemic remained challenging and sometimes highly controversial. Here, we highlight this challenge by performing a comparative evaluation for the estimations obtained from three COVID-19 surge calculators under different social distancing approaches, taking Lebanon as a case study. Despite discrepancies in estimations, the three surge calculators used herein agree that there will be a relative shortage in the capacity of medical resources and a significant surge in PPE demand as the social distancing policy is removed. Our results underscore the importance of implementing containment interventions including social distancing in alleviating the demand for medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic in the absence of any medication or vaccine. It is said that """"All models are wrong, but some are useful,"""" in this paper we highlight that it is even more useful to employ several models.","Kamar, A.

This toolbox is built upon a hierarchical epidemiological model in which two observed time series of daily proportions of infected and removed cases are emitted from the underlying infection dynamics governed by a Markov SIR infectious disease process. We extend the SIR model to incorporate various types of time-varying quarantine protocols, including government-level macro isolation policies and community-level micro inspection measures. We develop a calibration procedure for under-reported infected cases. This toolbox provides forecast, in both online and offline forms, of turning points of interest, including the time when daily infected proportion becomes smaller than the previous ones and the time when daily infected proportions becomes smaller than that of daily removed proportion, as well as the ending time of the epidemic. An R software is made available for the public, and examples on the use of this software are illustrated. Some possible extensions of our novel epidemiological models are discussed.","Song, P.

20758,Analysis of Intervention Effectiveness Using Early Outbreak Transmission Dynamics to Guide Future Pandemic Management and Decision-Making in Kuwait,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a World Health Organization designated pandemic that can result in severe symptoms and death that disproportionately affects older patients or those with comorbidities. Kuwait reported its first imported cases of COVID-19 on February 24, 2020. Analysis of data from the first three months of community transmission of the COVID-19 outbreak in Kuwait can provide important guidance for decision-making when dealing with future SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave management. The analysis of intervention scenarios can help to evaluate the possible impacts of various outbreak control measures going forward which aim to reduce the effective reproduction number during the initial outbreak wave. Herein we use a modified susceptible-exposed-asymptomatic-infectious-removed (SEAIR) transmission model to estimate the outbreak dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Kuwait. We fit case data from the first 96 days in the model to estimate the basic reproduction number and used Google mobility data to refine community contact matrices. The SEAIR modelled scenarios allow for the analysis of various interventions to determine their effectiveness. The model can help inform future pandemic wave management, not only in Kuwait but for other countries as well.","Tyshenko, M. G.; Oraby, T.; Longenecker, J.

3796,Repurposing Therapeutics for COVID-19: Rapid Prediction of Commercially available drugs through Machine Learning and Docking,"BackgroundThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread rapidly around the globe during the past 3 months. As the virus infected cases and mortality rate of this disease is increasing exponentially, scientists and researchers all over the world are relentlessly working to understand this new virus along with possible treatment regimens by discovering active therapeutic agents and vaccines. So, there is an urgent requirement of new and effective medications that can treat the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Methods and findingsWe perform the study of drugs that are already available in the market and being used for other diseases to accelerate clinical recovery, in other words repurposing of existing drugs. The vast complexity in drug design and protocols regarding clinical trials often prohibit developing various new drug combinations for this epidemic disease in a limited time. Recently, remarkable improvements in computational power coupled with advancements in Machine Learning (ML) technology have been utilized to revolutionize the drug development process. Consequently, a detailed study using ML for the repurposing of therapeutic agents is urgently required. Here, we report the ML model based on the Naive Bayes algorithm, which has an accuracy of around 73% to predict the drugs that could be used for the treatment of COVID-19. Our study predicts around ten FDA approved commercial drugs that can be used for repurposing. Among all, we suggest that the antiretroviral drug Atazanavir (DrugBank ID - DB01072) would probably be one of the most effective drugs based on the selected criterions.

ConclusionsOur study can help clinical scientists in being more selective in identifying and testing the therapeutic agents for COVID-19 treatment. The ML based approach for drug discovery as reported here can be a futuristic smart drug designing strategy for community applications.

6191,Prediction of Spreads of COVID-19 in India from Current Trend,"The article describe modelling efforts for evaluating the current level of COVID-19 infections in India, using exponential model. The Data from 15 march 2020 to 30 April 2020 are used for validating the model, where intrinsic rise rate is kept constant. It is observed that some states of India, like MAharastra, Gujarat and Delhi have a much higher daily infection cases. This is modelled by assuming an initial higher infections, keeping rise rate same. The sudden outbursts are captured using offset of values for these three states. Data from other states like Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan are also analysed and they are found to be following the same constants as India is following. Worldwide, many attempts are made to predict outburst of COVID-19 and in the model, described in this paper, turning point is not predicted, as cases in India are still rising. The developed model is based on daily confirmed infections and not on cumulative infections and rationalization is carried out for the population of various regions, while predicting infections for various states. Assigning a decay constant at this stage will be a premature exercise and keeping that in mind, exponential model predicts that India will attain 1 lakh case by 15 May 2020.

26518,SARS-CoV-2 naïve and recovered individuals show qualitatively different antibody responses following mRNA vaccination,"mRNA-based vaccines effectively induce protective neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. The specific compositional patterns of these responses remain largely unknown. We found that SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals receiving the first dose of an mRNA vaccine developed a SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody response with a subclass profile comparable to that induced by the natural infection, except IgA2, which did not increase. SARS-CoV-2-naive subjects also mounted a robust virus-specific recall response after receiving the second dose. This response increased all IgG subclasses, but boosted neither IgM nor IgA1 and IgA2 subclasses. In contrast, individuals recovered from COVID-19 mounted peak virus-specific antibody responses upon primary immunization and did not further augment such responses following secondary immunization. Remarkably, compared to SARS-CoV-2-naive subjects, individuals with pre-existing immunity showed increased levels of all virus-specific antibodies but IgG3 following primary vaccination. By dissecting the heterogeneity of mRNA vaccine-induced humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2, our findings indicate that the induction of optimal immune protection may require the development of personalized vaccination programs.","Tejedor Vaquero, S.; De Campos-Mata, L.; Ramada, J.

ObjectiveTo characterize anti-COVID-19 antibodies in follicular fluid and compare ovarian follicle function in women following confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 vaccination, and non-infected, unvaccinated controls.

DesignThis is a cohort study conducted between February 1 and March 10, 2021.

SettingA single university hospital-based IVF clinic.

ParticipantsConsecutive sample of female patients undergoing oocyte retrieval.

InterventionsConsenting patients were recruited and assigned to one of three study groups: recovering from confirmed COVID 19 (n=9); vaccinated (n=9); and uninfected, non-vaccinated controls (n=14). Serum and follicular fluid samples were taken and analyzed for anti-COVID IgG as well as estrogen, progesterone and HSPG2 concentration, as well as the number and maturity of aspirated oocytes and previous estrogen and progesterone measurements.

Main outcome measuresFollicular function, including steroidogenesis, follicular response to the LH/hCG trigger, and oocyte quality biomarkers.

ResultsBoth natural and vaccine elicited anti-COVID IgG antibodies were detected in the follicular fluid in levels proportional to the IgG serum concentration. No differences were detected in any of the surrogate ovarian follicle quality reporting parameters.

Conclusions and relevanceBoth SARS-COV-2 infection and vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine mediate IgG immunity that crosses into the follicular fluid. No detrimental effect on follicular function was detected.

MethodsWe studied 19 adults, severely ill patients with COVID-19 infection, who were admitted to King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between 13th March and 17th April 2020. Blood samples on day 1, 3, and 7 of enrollment were analyzed for endotoxin activity assay (EAA), (1[-&gt;]3)-{beta}-D-Glucan (BG), and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine the circulating bacteriome.

ResultsOf the 19 patients, 14 were in intensive care and 10 patients received mechanical ventilation. We found 8 patients with high EAA ([&ge;] 0.6) and about half of the patients had high serum BG levels which tended to be higher in later in the illness. Although only 1 patient had a positive blood culture, 18 of 19 patients were positive for 16S rRNA gene amplification. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum. The diversity of bacterial genera was decreased overtime.

ConclusionsBacterial DNA and toxins were discovered in virtual all severely ill COVID-19 pneumonia patients.

27873,"SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among Vancouver public school staff in British Columbia, Canada","ImportanceContact-tracing studies suggest minimal secondary transmission in schools. However, there are limited school data accounting for asymptomatic cases, particularly late in the 2020/21 school year, and in the context of uninterrupted in-person schooling and widespread community transmission.

ObjectivesTo determine the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a sample of school staff, compared to the community, and to COVID-19 rates among all students and staff within the same school population.

DesignIncident COVID-19 cases among students and school staff using public health data, with an embedded cross-sectional serosurvey among school staff sampled from February 10 to May 15, 2021, comparing to age, sex and geographic location-matched blood donors sampled in January 2021.

SettingVancouver School District (British Columbia, Canada) from kindergarten to grade 12.

ParticipantsActive school staff enrolled from February 3 to April 23, 2021.

Main outcome measuresSARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a sample of school staff using spike (S)-based testing (unvaccinated staff) or N-based serology testing (vaccinated staff).

ResultsThe incidence of COVID-19 cases among students attending in-person was 9.8 per 1,000 students during the 2020/21 school year (N = 47,280 students), and among staff was 13 per 1,000 since the beginning of the pandemic (N = 7,071 active school staff). In total, 1,689 school staff (64% elementary, 28% secondary, 8.3% school board staff or multiple grades) completed the questionnaire, 78.2% had classroom responsibilities, and spent a median of 17.6 hours in class per week [IQR: 5.0 - 25 hours]. Although 21.5% (363/1,686) reported close contact with a COVID-19 case, only 1.4% (24/1688) of the school staff reported having had a positive viral nucleic acid test. Of this group, five believed they acquired the infection at school. The adjusted seroprevalence in staff who gave blood (1,556/1,689, 92.1%) was 2.3% [95%CI: 1.6 - 3.2%] compared to 2.3% [95%CI: 1.7 - 3.0%] in blood donors.

Conclusion and relevanceDespite high reported COVID-19 cases among students and staff, and frequent within-school exposures, we found no detectable increase in seroprevalence among school staff above the community seroprevalence. These findings corroborate claims that, with appropriate mitigation strategies, in-person schooling is not associated with significantly increased risk for school staff.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat was the prevalence of COVID-19 infections in school staff who maintained in-person schooling during the 2020/21 school year in Vancouver, British Columbia, and how does it compare to the risk of COVID-19 infection in the community.

FindingsAs of March 4, 2021, the incidence of COVID-19 cases among school staff was 13 per 1,000 (N = 7,071 school staff) since the beginning of the pandemic. In a cross-sectional seroprevalence analysis from February 10 to May 15, 2021, the adjusted seroprevalence among a sample of school staff (N = 1,556) was 2.3% [95%CI: 1.6 - 3.2%], compared to 2.3% [95%CI: 1.7 - 3.0%] in 1:2 age, sex and geographical location (by postal code)-matched reference group of blood donors.

MeaningWe found no detectable increase in seroprevalence among school staff above the community seroprevalence.

12976,"Fitting to the UK COVID-19 outbreak, short-term forecasts and estimating the reproductive number","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the fore the need for policy makers to receive timely and ongoing scientific guidance in response to this recently emerged human infectious disease. Fitting mathematical models of infectious disease transmission to the available epidemiological data provides a key statistical tool for understanding the many quantities of interest that are not explicit in the underlying epidemiological data streams. Of these, the basic reproductive ratio, R, has taken on special significance in terms of the general understanding of whether the epidemic is under control (R< 1). Unfortunately, none of the epidemiological data streams are designed for modelling, hence assimilating information from multiple (often changing) sources of data is a major challenge that is particularly stark in novel disease outbreaks.

Here, we present in some detail the inference scheme employed for calibrating the Warwick COVID-19 model to the available public health data streams, which span hospitalisations, critical care occupancy, mortality and serological testing. We then perform computational simulations, making use of the acquired parameter posterior distributions, to assess how the accuracy of short-term predictions varied over the timecourse of the outbreak. To conclude, we compare how refinements to data streams and model structure impact estimates of epidemiological measures, including the estimated growth rate and daily incidence.","Keeling, M.

13843,How early into the outbreak can surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater tell us?,"There is increasing interest to use wastewater-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 as an early warning of the outbreak within a community. Despite successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters sampled from multiple locations, there is still no clear idea on the minimal number of cases needed in a community to result in a positive detection of the virus in wastewaters. To address this knowledge gap, we sampled wastewaters from a septic tank and biological activated sludge tank located on-site of a hospital. The hospital is providing treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, with the number of hospitalized patients per day known. It was observed that > 253 positive cases out of 10,000 persons are required prior to detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. There was a weak correlation between N1 and N2 gene abundances in wastewater with the number of hospitalized cases. This correlation was however not observed for N3 gene. The occurrence frequency of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 5 times lower in the partially treated wastewater than in the septic tank. Furthermore, abundance of N1 and N3 genes in the activated sludge tank were 50 and 70% of the levels detected in septic tank, suggesting poor persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments in wastewater.

23950,Impact of booster COVID-19 vaccine for Moroccan adults: A discrete age-structured model approach,"Public health control strategies, such as lockdown, seem to be effective in reducing the spread of the pandemic, but are ineffective as a whole since lockdown is responsible of global economic crisis and badly lived by the majority of children and adults who have developed mental health disorders and familial problems as well. Thus, the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 is needed to control this disease. We have developed a discrete age-structured model and followed the Moroccan vaccination program to assess the impact of booster vaccination targeting Moroccan adults against COVID-19. Using the derived model, we estimated some relevant model parameters related to COVID-19 using collected cumulative mortality and reported Moroccan data. A control reproduction number Rc, which determines the necessary level of vaccine uptake that lead to COVID-19 eradication is determined. Furthermore, a herd immunity threshold above which the population can be protected from COVID-19 infection is derived. Analyzing the model, sufficient and necessary conditions for the eradication of the disease are obtained as well. Next, we perform numerical simulations to study the impact of several uptake levels of the potential vaccine on the persistence and the extinction of COVID-19 pandemic. Our results show that the COVID-19 is expected to last past 2021 in the absence of a vaccination program. Moreover, a vaccination of the adult population at rate 0.6% per day needs at least 67% of vaccine efficacy and 90% of immunogenicity rate to eradicate the disease. Using Sinopharm vaccine, the herd immunity can be achieved when about half of Moroccan adult population is immunized against the COVID-19. However, using Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, less than 60% of adult population must be immunized against the disease to achieve the herd immunity. Finally, if vaccine efficacy is about 80% and the immunogenicity is about 50% then vaccinating adults at rate of 0.6% per day could protect roughly 22% of children from COVID-19 infection.","Hammoumi, A.; Hmarrass, H.; Qesmi, R.",2021-03-17,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.03.14.21253555,1,Redouane Qesmi,USMBA University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.14.21253555v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.14.21253555v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
22823,A Second Wave? What Do People Mean By COVID Waves? - A Working Definition of Epidemic Waves,"Policymakers and researchers describe the COVID-19 epidemics by waves without a common vocabulary on what constitutes an epidemic wave, either in terms of a working definition or operationalization, causing inconsistencies and confusions. A working definition and operationalization can be helpful to characterize and communicate about epidemics. We propose a working definition of epidemic waves in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and an operationalization based on the public data of the effective reproduction number R. Our operationalization characterizes the numbers and durations of waves (upward and downward) in 178 countries and reveals patterns that can enable healthcare organizations and policymakers to make better description and assessment of the COVID crisis to make more informed resource planning, mobilization, and allocation temporally in the continued COVID-19 pandemic.

2825,Prognostic value of C-reactive protein in patients with COVID-19,"BackgroundElevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level was observed in most patients with COVID-19.

MethodsData of COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, were retrospectively collected and analyzed from Jan 30 to Feb 20, 2020. The prognostic value of admission CRP was evaluated in patients with COVID-19.

ResultsOut of 298 patients enrolled, 84 died and 214 recovered. Most non-survivors tended to be males, old aged, or with chronic diseases. Compared to survivors, non-survivors showed significantly elevated white blood cell and neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII, defined by platelet count multiply by NLR), CRP, procalcitonin, and D-dimer, and decreased red blood cell, lymphocyte, and platelet count. Age, neutrophil count, platelet count, and CRP were identified as independent predictors of adverse outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of CRP (0.896) was significantly higher than that of age (0.833), neutrophil count (0.820), and platelet count (0.678) in outcome prediction (all p<0.05). With a cut-off value of 41.4, CRP exhibited sensitivity 90.5%, specificity 77.6%, positive predictive value 61.3%, and negative predictive value 95.4%. Subgroup analysis revealed that CRP remained robust accuracy in adverse outcome prediction in patients with different disease severity (AUC 0.832, z=10.23, p<0.001; AUC 0.989, z=44.04, p<0.001). CRP was also an independent discriminator of severe/critical illness on admission (AUC 0.783, z=10.69, p<0.001).

ConclusionsIn patients with COVID-19, admission CRP correlated with disease severity and tended to be a good predictor of adverse outcome.","Luo, X.; Zhou, W.; Yan, X.; Guo, T.; Wang, B.; Xia, H.; Ye, L.; Xiong, J.; Jiang, Z.; Liu, Y.; Zhang, B.; Yang, W.",2020-03-23,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.21.20040360,1,Xiaomin Luo,Renmin hospital of Wuhan University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040360v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040360v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1093/cid/ciaa641
16464,Safely Reopening K-12 Schools During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Early school closures were a consistent, nationwide response to the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-March due to the role that children play in spreading influenza. This left us with limited understanding of COVID-19 transmission in children until several states reopened schools for the 2020-2021 school year. While early school closures were likely beneficial in protecting children in the initial stages of the pandemic in the U.S., long-term closures pose significant cumulative effects in children who rely on schools for instruction and additional social services, and for parents who need to balance work and childcare obligations. Reopening schools safely is a high priority for many interested stakeholders.

Proposed in-person school reopening plans include traditional, 100% school capacity, five days per week instruction, hybrid scenarios with reduced in-person instruction and virtual learning, and various reduced school capacity schedules with non-pharmaceutical interventions in place. To assess the potential impacts of different reopening plans, we created a modified SIR-type transmission model that captures multiple known pathways of COVID-19 transmission in a 100,000-person community.

Our results show that plans that utilize consecutive days in school and divide students into separated smaller cohorts who attend school together, as well as plans that emphasize distance learning, are better able to suppress disease spread and reduce risk from an introduced infective into the community. Plans with more consecutive school days are protective for both the schoolchildren and surrounding community by acting to separate the larger intermixing population into smaller intermixing subpopulations. The """"Five-Day Switch"""" plan, which separates students into two cohorts, each of whom attend in-person learning for five consecutive days followed by five days of distance learning, best captures these protective attributes. All modeled plans assumed initially disease-free communities and that childrens interactions with the community are greatly reduced during instructional days, both for in-person and distance learning.","Shelley, C.

2505,The demand for inpatient and ICU beds for COVID-19 in the US: lessons from Chinese cities,"BackgroundSustained spread of SARS-CoV-2 has happened in major US cities. Capacity needs in Chinese cities could inform the planning of local healthcare resources.

MethodsWe described the intensive care unit (ICU) and inpatient bed needs for confirmed COVID-19 patients in two Chinese cities (Wuhan and Guangzhou) from January 10 to February 29, 2020, and compared the timing of disease control measures in relation to the timing of SARS-CoV-2 community spread. We estimated the peak ICU bed needs in US cities if a Wuhan-like outbreak occurs.

ResultsIn Wuhan, strict disease control measures were implemented six weeks after sustained local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Between January 10 and February 29, COVID-19 patients accounted for an average of 637 ICU patients and 3,454 serious inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 19,425 patients (24.5 per 10,000 adults) were hospitalized, 9,689 (12.2 per 10,000 adults) were considered to be in serious condition, and 2,087 patients (2.6 per 10,000 adults) needed critical care per day. In Guangzhou, strict disease control measures were implemented within one week of case importation. Between January 24 and February 29, COVID-19 accounted for an average of 9 ICU patients and 20 inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 15 patients were in critical condition, and 38 were classified as serious. If a Wuhan-like outbreak were to happen in a US city, the need for healthcare resources may be higher in cities with a higher prevalence of vulnerable populations.

ConclusionEven after the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, the number of seriously ill COVID-19 patients continued to rise, exceeding local hospitalization and ICU capacities for at least a month. Plans are urgently needed to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 outbreaks on the local healthcare system in US cities.","Li, R.; Rivers, C.; Tan, Q.; Murray, M.

21657,SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and subsequent infection risk in healthy young adults: a prospective cohort study,"BackgroundThe risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) subsequent infection among seropositive young adults was studied prospectively.

MethodsThe study population comprised 3,249 predominantly male, 18-20-year-old Marine recruits. Upon arrival at a Marine-supervised two-week quarantine, participants were assessed for baseline SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity, defined as a 1:150 dilution or greater on receptor binding domain and full-length spike protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays. SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed by PCR at initiation, middle and end of the quarantine. After appropriate exclusions, including participants with a positive PCR during quarantine, we performed three biweekly PCR tests in both seropositive and in seronegative groups once recruits left quarantine and entered basic training and baseline neutralizing antibody titers on all subsequently infected seropositive and selected seropositive uninfected participants.

FindingsAmong 189 seropositive participants, 19 (10.1%) had at least one positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 during the six-week follow-up (1.1 cases per person-year). In contrast, 1,079 (48.0%) of the 2,247 seronegative participants tested positive (6.2 cases per person-year). The incidence rate ratio was 0.18 (95% CI 0.11-0.28, p<0.00001). Among seropositive recruits, infection was associated with lower baseline full-length spike protein IgG titers (p<0.0001). Compared with seronegative recruits, seropositive recruits had about 10-fold lower viral loads (ORF1ab gene, p<0.005), and trended towards shorter duration of PCR positivity (p=0.18) and more frequent asymptomatic infections (p=0.13). Among seropositive participants, baseline neutralizing titers were detected in 45 of 54 (83.3%) uninfected and in 6 of 19 (31.6%) infected participants during the 6 weeks of observation (ID50 difference p<.0001).

InterpretationSeropositive young adults had about one-fifth the risk of subsequent infection compared with seronegative individuals. Although antibodies induced by initial infection are largely protective, they do not guarantee effective SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity or immunity against subsequent infection. These findings may be relevant for optimization of mass vaccination strategies.

5235,Measuring Italian Citizens' Engagement in the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic Containment Measures A Cross-sectional Study,"BackgroundIn January 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started to spread in Italy. The Italian government adopted urgent measures to hold its spread. Enforcing compliance to such measures is crucial in order to enhance their effectiveness. Engaging citizens in the COVID-19 preventive process is today urgent in Italy and around the world. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the role of health engagement in predicting citizens compliance to health emergency containment measures.

MethodAn online survey was administered between February 28th and March 4th 2020 on a representative sample of 1000 Italians. The questionnaire included a measure of Health Engagement (PHE-S) and a series of ad hoc items intended to measure both affective and behavioral responses of the citizens to the emergency in terms of perceived susceptibility to and severity of the disease, orientation towards health management, change in habits and in purchases. To investigate the relationship between Health Engagement and these variables, a series of ANOVAs, Logistic regressions and crosstabs have been carried out.

ResultsLess engaged people show higher levels of perceived susceptibility to the virus and of severity of the disease; they trust less scientific and healthcare authorities, they feel less self-effective in managing their own health - both in normal conditions and under stress - and are less prone to cooperate with healthcare professionals. Low levels of Health Engagement are also associated with a change in the usual purchase behavior.

ConclusionsThe Patient Health Engagement Model (PHE) provides a useful framework for understanding how people will respond to health threats such as pandemics. Therefore, intervention studies should focus on particular groups and on raising their levels of engagement to increase the effectiveness of educational initiatives devoted to promote preventive behaviors.","Graffigna, G.; Barello, S.; Savarese, M.; Palamenghi, L.; Castellini, G.; Bonanomi, A.; Lozza, E.",2020-04-25,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.04.22.20075234,1,Serena Barello,Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20075234v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20075234v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1371/journal.pone.0238613

The present study aims to investigate fluctuations in depression and anxiety using COVID-19 as a model crisis.

Methods1,512 adults living in the U.S. enrolled in this online study on April 2nd, 2020 and were assessed weekly for 10 weeks (until June 4th, 2020; final n=537). Depression and anxiety were measured using the Zung Self-Rating Depression scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (state subscale), respectively, along with demographic and COVID-related questions. Mixed-effects linear regression models were used to examine factors contributing to longitudinal changes in depression and anxiety.

ResultsDepression and anxiety levels were high in early April, but declined over time (F(9,4824)=17.53, p<.001 and F(9,4824)=23.35, p<.001, respectively). In addition to demographic factors such as sex, age, income, and psychiatric diagnoses, we identified some overlapping and some distinct dynamic factors contributing to changes in depression and anxiety: worsening of weekly individual economic impact of COVID-19 increased both depression and anxiety, while increased seven-day change in COVID-19 cases, social media use, and projected pandemic duration were positively associated with anxiety, but not depression.

ConclusionsAlongside evidence for overall emotional adaptation, these findings highlight overlapping (economic), yet distinct (change in COVID-19 cases, social media use, and projected COVID-19 duration) factors contributing to fluctuations in depression and anxiety throughout the first wave of COVID-19. These results provide insight into socioeconomic policies and behavioral changes that can increase emotional adaptation in times of crisis.","Shuster, A.; O'brien, M.; Luo, Y.; Heflin, M.; Chung, D.; Na, S.; Perl, O.; Kulkarni, K.; Fiore, V.

3763,Can N95 respirators be reused after disinfection? And for how many times?,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a major shortage of N95 respirators, which are essential to protecting healthcare professionals and the general public who may come into contact with the virus. Thus, it is essential to determine how we can reuse respirators and other personal protection in these urgent times. We investigated multiple commonly used and easily deployable, scalable disinfection schemes on media with particle filtration efficiency of 95%. Among these, heating ([&le;]85 {degrees}C) under various humidities ([&le;]100% RH) was the most promising, nondestructive method for the preservation of filtration properties in meltblown fabrics as well as N95-grade respirators. Heating can be applied up to 50 cycles (85 {degrees}C, 30% RH) without observation in the degradation of meltblown filtration performance. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was a secondary choice which was able to withstand 10 cycles of treatment and showed small degradation by 20 cycles. However, UV can also potentially impact the material strength and fit of respirators. Finally, treatments involving liquids and vapors require caution, as steam, alcohol, and household bleach may all lead to degradation of the filtration efficiency, leaving the user vulnerable to the viral aerosols.","Liao, L.; Xiao, W.; Zhao, M.; Yu, X.; Wang, H.; Wang, Q.; Chu, S.; Cui, Y.",2020-04-17,Occupational And Environmental Health,10.1101/2020.04.01.20050443,2,Yi Cui,Stanford University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050443v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050443v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.1021/acsnano.0c03597
9811,Air Quality and COVID-19 Prevalence/Fatality,"To investigate the association of real-time/observed ozone/PM2.5 levels with COVID-19 prevalence/fatality, meta-regression of data from the Northeast megalopolis was conducted. Daily Air Quality Index (AQI) values based on available ozone/PM2.5 data in these counties/cities (3/15/2020-5/31/2020) were extracted from US Environmental Protection Agency and World Air Quality Project. In each county/city, total confirmed COVID-19 cases/deaths (5/31/2020) were available from Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, and total population was extracted from US Census Bureau. Random-effects meta-regression was performed using OpenMetaAnalyst. A meta-regression graph depicted COVID-19 prevalence and fatality (plotted as logarithm-transformed prevalence/fatality on the y-axis) as a function of mean ozone/PM2.5 AQI (plotted on the x-axis). Coefficients were not statistically significant for ozone (P = 0.212/0.814 for prevalence/fatality) and PM2.5 (P = 0.986/0.499). Although multivariable analysis had been planned, it was not performed because of non-significant covariates of interest in the univariable model.

22991,Using next generation matrices to estimate the proportion of cases that are not detected in an outbreak,"Contact tracing, where exposed individuals are followed up to break ongoing transmission chains, is a key pillar of outbreak response for many infectious disease outbreaks, such as Ebola and SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, these systems are not fully effective, and cases can still go undetected as people may not know or remember all of their contacts or contacts may not be able to be traced. A large proportion of undetected cases suggests poor contact tracing and surveillance systems, which could be a potential area of improvement for a disease response. In this paper, we present a novel method for estimating the proportion of cases that are not detected during an outbreak. Our method uses next generation matrices that are parameterized by linked contact tracing and case line-lists. We use this method to investigate the proportion of undetected cases in two case studies: the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in New Zealand during 2020 and the West African Ebola outbreak in Guinea during 2014. We estimate that only 6% of SARS-CoV-2 cases were not detected in New Zealand (95% credible interval: 1.31 - 16.7%), but over 60% of Ebola cases were not detected in Guinea (95% credible interval: 15 - 90%).","Unwin, H.

21614,"U.S. Public Views about COVID-19 """"Immunity Passports""""","ImportanceDiscovery of effective vaccines and increased confidence that infection confers extended protection against COVID-19 have renewed discussion of using immunity certificates or """"passports"""" to selectively reduce ongoing public health restrictions.

ObjectiveTo determine public views regarding government and private conferral of immunity privileges.

Design and SettingNational on-line survey fielded in June 2020. Participants were randomly asked about either government """"passports"""" or private """"certificates"""" for COVID-19 immunity.

ParticipantsAdults from a standing panel maintained for academic research, selected to approximate national demographics.

Main Outcomes/MeasuresLevel of support/opposition to immunity privileges, and whether views vary based on: government vs. private adoption; demographics; political affiliation or views; or various COVID19-related attitudes and experiences.

ResultsOf 1315 respondents, 45.2% supported immunity privileges, with slightly more favoring private certificates than government passports (48.1% vs 42.6%, p=0.04). Support was greater for using passports or certificates to enable returns to high-risk jobs or attendance at large recreational events than for returning to work generally. Levels of support did not vary significantly according to age groups, socioeconomic or employment status, urbanicity, political affiliation or views, or whether the respondent had chronic disease(s). However, estimates from adjusted analyses showed less support among women (Odds Ratio, 0.64; 95% Confidence Interval, 0.51 to 0.80), and among Hispanics (0.56; 0.40 to 0.78) and other minorities (0.58; 0.40 to 0.85) compared with whites, but not among blacks (0.83; 0.60 to 1.15). Support was much higher among those who personally wanted a passport or certificate (75.6% vs 24.4%) and much lower among those who believed this would harm the social fabric of their community (22.9% vs 77.1%).

Conclusions and RelevancePublic views are divided on either government or private use of immunity certificates, but, prior to any efforts to politicize the issues, these views do not vary along usual political lines, nor by characteristics that indicate individual vulnerability to infection. Social consensus on the desirability of an immunity privileges programs may be difficult to achieve.

10367,Retrospective Methodology to Estimate Daily Infections from Deaths (REMEDID) in COVID-19: the Spain case study,"The number of new daily infections is one of the main parameters to understand the dynamics of an epidemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, however, such information has been underestimated. Here, we propose a retrospective methodology to estimate daily infections from daily deaths, because those are usually more accurately documented. This methodology is applied to Spain and its 19 administrative regions. Our results showed that probable infections during the first wave were between 35 and 42 times more than those officially documented on 14 March, when the national government decreed a national lockdown and 9 times more than those documented by the updated version of the official data. The national lockdown had a strong effect on the growth rate of virus transmission, which began to decrease immediately. Finally, the first inferred infection in Spain is about 43 days before it was officially reported during the first wave. The current official data show delays of 15-30 days in the first infection relative to the inferred infections in 63% of the regions. In summary, we propose a methodology that allows reinterpretation of official daily infections, improving data accuracy in infection magnitude and dates because it assimilates valuable information from the National Seroprevalence Studies.","Garcia-Garcia, D.; Vigo, M.

20610,Optimizing vaccine allocation for COVID-19 vaccines: potential role of single-dose vaccination.,"Most COVID-19 vaccines require two doses, however with limited vaccine supply, policymakers are considering single-dose vaccination as an alternative strategy. Using a mathematical model combined with optimization algorithms, we determined optimal allocation strategies with one and two doses of vaccine under various degrees of viral transmission. Under low transmission, we show that the optimal allocation of vaccine vitally depends on the single-dose efficacy (SDE). With high SDE, single-dose vaccination is optimal, preventing up to 22% more deaths than a strategy prioritizing two-dose vaccination for older adults. With low or moderate SDE, mixed vaccination campaigns with complete coverage of older adults are optimal. However, with modest or high transmission, vaccinating older adults first with two doses is best, preventing up to 41% more deaths than a singledose vaccination given across all adult populations. Our work suggests that it is imperative to determine the efficacy and durability of single-dose vaccines, as mixed or single-dose vaccination campaigns may have the potential to contain the pandemic much more quickly.","Matrajt, L.; Eaton, J.; Leung, T.; Dimitrov, D.; Schiffer, J.

12476,Epidemiological dynamics of enterovirus D68 in the US: implications for acute flaccid myelitis,"The lack of active surveillance for enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) in the US has hampered the ability to assess the relationship with predominantly biennial epidemics of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a rare but serious neurological condition. Using novel surveillance data from the BioFire(R) Syndromic Trends (Trend) epidemiology network, we characterize the epidemiological dynamics of EV-D68 and demonstrate strong spatiotemporal association with AFM. Although the recent dominant biennial cycles of EV-D68 dynamics may not be stable, we show that a major EV-D68 epidemic, and hence an AFM outbreak, would still be possible in 2020 under normal epidemiological conditions. Significant social distancing due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could reduce the size of an EV-D68 epidemic in 2020, illustrating the potential broader epidemiological impact of the pandemic.

8413,How did governmental interventions affect the spread of COVID-19 in European countries?,"BackgroundTo reduce transmission of Coronavirus Disease 2019, European governments have implemented successive measures to encourage social distancing. However, it remained unclear how effectively measures reduced the spread of the virus, due to data complications. We examined how the effective-contact rate (ECR) among European citizens evolved over the period with implemented measures using a new data-oriented approach that is based on an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model.

MethodsUsing the available data on the confirmed numbers of infections and hospitalizations, we first estimated the daily number of infectious-, exposed- and susceptible individuals and subsequently estimated the ECR with an iterative Poisson regression model, disregarding information on governmental measures. We then studied change points in the daily ECRs to the moments of the governmental measures.

FindingsThe change points in the daily ECRs were found to align with the implementation of governmental interventions. At the end of the considered time-window, we found similar ECRs for Italy (0{middle dot}29), Spain (0{middle dot}24), and Germany (0{middle dot}27), while the ECR in the Netherlands (0{middle dot}34), Belgium (0{middle dot}35) and the UK (0{middle dot}37) were somewhat higher. The highest ECR was found for Sweden (0{middle dot}45).

InterpretationThere seemed to be an immediate effect of banning events and closing schools, typically among the first measures taken by the governments. The effect of additionally closing bars and restaurants seemed limited. For most countries a somewhat delayed effect of the full lockdown was observed, and the ECR after a full lockdown was not necessarily lower than an ECR after (only) a gathering ban.","Post, R. A.

ObjectiveTo determine long-term symptoms in COVID-19 survivors after infection.

Data SourcesA literature search was performed using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and CHINAL and preprint servers MedR{chi}iv and BioR{chi}iv through January 15, 2021.

Study SelectionEligible studies were those reporting patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and who showed any symptoms persisting beyond the acute phase.

Data Extraction and SynthesisIncidence rate of symptoms were pooled using inverse variance methods with a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was pain-related symptoms such as headache or myalgia. Secondary outcomes were symptoms relevant to pain (depression or muscle weakness) and symptoms frequently reported (anosmia and dyspnea). Heterogeneity among studies and publication bias for each symptom were estimated. The source of heterogeneity was explored using meta-regression, with follow-up period, age and sex as covariates.

ResultsIn total, 35 studies including 18,711 patients were eligible. Eight pain-related symptoms and 26 other symptoms were identified. The highest pooled incidence among pain-related symptoms was chest pain (17%, 95% CI, 12%-25%), followed by headache (16%, 95% CI, 9%-27%), arthralgia (13%, 95% CI, 7%-24%), neuralgia (12%, 95% CI, 3%-38%) and abdominal pain (11%, 95% CI, 7%-16%). The highest pooled incidence among other symptoms was fatigue (45%, 95% CI, 32%-59%), followed by insomnia (26%, 95% CI, 9%-57%), dyspnea (25%, 95% CI, 15%-38%), weakness (25%, 95% CI, 8%-56%) and anosmia (19%, 95% CI, 13%-27%). Substantial heterogeneity was identified (I2, 50-100%). Meta-regression analyses partially accounted for the source of heterogeneity, and yet, 53% of the symptoms remained unexplained.

Conclusions and RelevanceThe current meta-analysis may provide a complete picture of incidence in PASC. It remains unclear, however, whether post-COVID symptoms progress or regress over time or to what extent PASC are associated with age or sex.

22619,Associations of Race/Ethnicity and Other Demographic and Socioeconomic Factors with Vaccine Initiation and Intention During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States,"BackgroundTo date, there has been limited data available to understand the associations between race/ethnicity and socioeconomic and related characteristics with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine initiation and planned vaccination in the United States.

MethodsTo better characterize COVID-19 vaccinations nationally, we leveraged large cross-sectional surveys conducted between January and March 2021 with relatively complete race/ethnicity and socioeconomic data and nationally-representative of U.S. households to estimate trends in levels of COVID-19 vaccine initiation and vaccine intention. We further used survey data from January and March 2021 in adults aged 18-85 years to analyze the associations between race/ethnicity, education, pre-pandemic household income, and financial hardship during the pandemic and the adjusted odds of: 1) receipt of [&ge;]1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine; and 2) among those unvaccinated, the definite intention to receive a vaccine, controlling for other demographic and socioeconomic factors.

ResultsWe observed persistent disparities in vaccine initiation for non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic multiracial persons, and in vaccine intention for Blacks and multiracial persons, compared to non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Asians. In late March 2021, the prevalence estimates of Hispanics and Blacks receiving a vaccine were 12 percentage points and 8 percentage points lower than for Whites, respectively. Moreover, both education and income levels exhibited positive dose-response relationships with vaccine initiation (P for trend[&le;]01 and <.001, respectively). Substantial financial hardship was linked to 35-44% lower odds of vaccination (P<.001). The most common reasons for vaccine hesitancy were concerns about side effects and safety, with evidence of higher levels of concerns about vaccine safety among Blacks vs. Whites.

ConclusionsIn this large, nationally-representative study with relatively complete race/ethnicity and socioeconomic data, we find that being Black non-Hispanic and having the least education and income were each independently associated with a markedly lower likelihood of definitely planning to get vaccinated or having been vaccinated. In the ensuing months of the pandemic, addressing the persevering racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities in vaccination due to differential access and vaccine hesitancy is essential to mitigate the pandemics higher risks of infection and adverse health outcomes in Hispanic, Black, and socioeconomically-disadvantaged communities.","Kim, D.",2021-04-14,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.02.16.21251769,2,Daniel Kim,Northeastern University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.16.21251769v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.16.21251769v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"

We analyzed patient records for all laboratory-confirmed cases reported in the province for the period of January 21 to March 16, 2020. To estimate the basic and daily reproduction numbers, we used a Bayesian framework. In addition, we estimate the number of cases averted by the implemented control strategies. The outbreak resulted in 539 confirmed cases, lasted less than two months, and no further local transmission was detected after February 27. The median age of local cases was 8 years older than that of imported cases. Severity of symptoms increased with age. We estimated R0 at 2.4 (95% CI: 1.6-3.7). The epidemic was self-sustained for about 3 weeks before going below the epidemic threshold 3 days after the declaration of a public health emergency by Sichuan authorities. Our findings indicate that, were the control measures be adopted four weeks later, the epidemic could have lasted 49 days longer (95%CI: 31-68 days), causing 9,216 (95%CI: 1,317-25,545) more cases and possibly overwhelming Sichuan healthcare system.","Liu, Q.; Bento, A.

25105,"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and response on the utilisation of health services during the first wave in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo","IntroductionHealth service use among the general public can decline during infectious disease outbreaks and has been predicted among low and middle-income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) implemented public health measures across Kinshasa, including strict lockdown measures in the Gombe health zone, to mitigate impact of the pandemic.

MethodsUsing data from the Health Management Information System (January 2018 - December 2020), we evaluated the impact of the pandemic on the use of essential health services (total visits, maternal health, vaccinations, visits for common infectious diseases, and diagnosis of non-communicable diseases) using interrupted time series with mixed effects segmented Poisson regression models during the first wave of the pandemic. Analyses were stratified by age, sex, health facility, and neighbourhood.

ResultsHealth service use dropped rapidly following the start of the pandemic and ranged from 16% for hypertension diagnoses to 39% for diabetes diagnoses. However, reductions were highly concentrated in Gombe (81% decline in total visits) relative to health zones without lockdown. When the lockdown was lifted, total visits, visits for infectious diseases, and diagnoses for non-communicable diseases increased approximately two-fold. Hospitals were more affected than health centres. Overall, the use of maternal health services and vaccinations was not significantly affected.

ConclusionThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in important reductions in health service utilisation in Kinshasa, particularly Gombe. Lifting of lockdown led to a rebound in the level of health service use but it remained lower than pre-pandemic levels.

Summary BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about this subjectC_ST_ABSO_LISubstantial declines in the use of health services among the general public have been well-documented during previous outbreaks of infectious diseases.
C_LIO_LIModelled studies predicted substantial increases in morbidity and mortality in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) mainly due to expected declines in the use of health services among the general public.
C_LIO_LIOnly a small number of studies have so far evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of health services in LMICs and none have also evaluated both the implementation and lifting of lockdown measures.
C_LI

What are the new findingsO_LIThis study found that overall use of health services declined in Kinshasa but was most pronounced in the Gombe health zone which was subject to strict lockdown measures.
C_LIO_LISome health services were more affected than others, most notably visits and tests for malaria and visits for new diagnoses of non-communicable diseases. Maternal and child health services were relatively unaffected.
C_LIO_LIWhen the lockdown measures were lifted, health service utilization rebounded but remained at levels lower than those observed pre-pandemic.
C_LI

What do the new findings implyO_LIThe COVID-19 pandemic has likely had important effects on the use of health services among the general public throughout LMICs. However, evidence from Kinshasa suggests the effects may not be as widespread as previously assumed.
C_LIO_LIThe impact of strict social distancing measures needs on COVID-19 outcomes needs to be weighed off against the potential population-level health effects of these policies in various international contexts.

DesignUsing a test-negative design study and linked laboratory, vaccination, and health administrative databases, we estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness (aVE) against symptomatic infection and severe outcomes (hospitalization or death) using multivariable logistic regression.

SettingOntario, Canada between 14 December 2020 and 19 April 2021.

ParticipantsCommunity-dwelling adults aged [&ge;]16 years who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and had COVID-19 symptoms.

InterventionsPfizer-BioNTechs BNT162b2 or Modernas mRNA-1273 vaccine.

Main outcome measuresLaboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 identified by RT-PCR; hospitalization or death associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsAmong 324,033 symptomatic individuals, 53,270 (16.4%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 21,272 (6.6%) received [&ge;]1 vaccine dose. Among test-positive cases, 2,479 (4.7%) had a severe outcome. aVE against symptomatic infection [&ge;]14 days after receiving only 1 dose was 60% (95%CI, 57 to 64%), increasing from 48% (95%CI, 41 to 54%) at 14-20 days after the first dose to 71% (95%CI, 63 to 78%) at 35-41 days. aVE [&ge;]7 days after receiving 2 doses was 91% (95%CI, 89 to 93%). Against severe outcomes, aVE [&ge;]14 days after receiving 1 dose was 70% (95%CI, 60 to 77%), increasing from 62% (95%CI, 44 to 75%) at 14-20 days to 91% (95%CI, 73 to 97%) at [&ge;]35 days, whereas aVE [&ge;]7 days after receiving 2 doses was 98% (95%CI, 88 to 100%). For adults aged [&ge;]70 years, aVE estimates were lower after receiving 1 dose, but were comparable to younger adults after 28 days.

MethodsWe conducted an observational retrospective cohort study using Optum(R) de-identified COVID-19 electronic health records from the United States to characterize patients who received a SARS-CoV-2 viral or antibody test between February 20, 2020 and July 10, 2020. We assessed temporal trends in testing and positivity by demographic and clinical characteristics; evaluated concordance between viral and antibody tests; and identified factors associated with positivity via multivariable logistic regression.

ResultsOur study population included 891,754 patients. Overall positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 was 9% and 12% for viral and antibody tests, respectively. Positivity rate was inversely associated with the number of individuals tested and decreased over time across regions and race/ethnicities. Among patients who received a viral test followed by an antibody test, concordance ranged from 90%-93% depending on the duration between the two tests which is notable given uncertainties related to specific viral and antibody test characteristics. The following factors increased the odds of viral and antibody positivity in multivariable models: male, Hispanic or non-Hispanic Black and Asian, uninsured or Medicaid insurance, Northeast residence, dementia, diabetes, and obesity. Charlson Comorbidity Index was negatively associated with test positivity. We identified symptoms that were positively associated with test positivity, as well as, commonly co-occurring symptoms / conditions. Pediatric patients had reduced odds of a positive viral test, but conversely had increased odds of a positive antibody test.

3845,Feasibility of Controlling COVID-19 Outbreaks in the UK by Rolling Interventions,"BackgroundRecent outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led a rapid global spread around the world. For controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, many countries have implemented two non-pharmaceutical interventions: suppression like immediate lock-downs in cities at epicentre of outbreak; or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both interventions have apparent pros and cons; the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is limited. We aimed to conduct a feasibility study for robustly estimating the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, peaks and lengths of COVID-19 breakouts by taking multiple interventions in London and the UK, accounting for reduction of healthcare demand.

MethodsWe developed a model to attempt to infer the impact of mitigation, suppression and multiple rolling interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in London and the UK. Our model assumed that each intervention has equivalent effect on the reproduction number R across countries and over time; where its intensity was presented by average-number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals; early immediate intensive intervention led to increased health need and social anxiety. We considered two important features: direct link between Exposed and Recovered population, and practical healthcare demand by separation of infections into mild and critical cases. Our model was fitted and calibrated with data on cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan to estimate how suppression intervention impacted on the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths over time during January 2020, and April 2020. We combined the calibrated model with data on the cases of COVID-19 in London and non-London regions in the UK during February 2020 and March 2020 to estimate the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, and healthcare demand by using multiple interventions.

FindingsWe estimated given that multiple interventions with an intensity range from 3 to 15, one optimal strategy was to take suppression with intensity 3 in London from 23rd March for 100 days, and 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in non-London regions. In this scenario, the total infections and deaths in the UK were limited to 2.43 million and 33.8 thousand; the peak time of healthcare demand was due to the 65th day (April 11th), where it needs hospital beds for 25.3 thousand severe and critical cases. If we took a simultaneous 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in all regions of the UK, the total infections and deaths increased slightly to 2.69 million and 37 thousand; the peak time of healthcare kept the same at the 65th day, where it needs equivalent hospital beds for severe and critical cases of 25.3 thousand. But if we released high band of rolling intervention intensity to 6 or 8 and simultaneously implemented them in all regions of the UK, the COVID-19 outbreak would not end in 1 year and distribute a multi-modal mode, where the total infections and deaths in the UK possibly reached to 16.2 million and 257 thousand.

InterpretationOur results show that taking rolling intervention is probably an optimal strategy to effectively and efficiently control COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK. As large difference of population density and social distancing between London and non-London regions in the UK, it is more appropriate to implement consistent suppression in London for 100 days and rolling intervention in other regions. This strategy would potentially reduce the overall infections and deaths, and delay and reduce peak healthcare demand.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSuppression and mitigation are two common interventions for controlling infectious disease outbreaks. Previous works show rapid suppression is able to immediately reduce infections to low levels by eliminating human-to-human transmission, but needs consistent maintenance; mitigation does not interrupt transmission completely and tolerates some increase of infections, but minimises health and economic impacts of viral spread.3 While current planning in many countries is focused on implementing either suppression or mitigation, it is not clear how and when to take which level of interventions for control COVID-19 breakouts to certain country in light of balancing its healthcare demands and economic impacts.

Added value of this studyWe used a mathematical model to access the feasibility of multiple intervention to control COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK. Our model distinguished self-recovered populations, infection with mild and critical cases for estimating healthcare demand. It combined available evidence from available data source in Wuhan. We estimated how suppression, mitigation and multiple rolling interventions impact on controlling outbreaks in London and non-London regions of the UK. We provided an evidence verification point that implementing suppression in London and rolling intervention with high intensity in non-London regions is probably an optimal strategy to control COVID-19 breakouts in the UK with minimised deaths and economic impacts.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe effectiveness and impact of suppression and mitigation to control outbreaks of COVID-19 depends on intervention intensity and duration, which remain unclear at the present time. Using the current best understanding of this model, implementing consistent suppression in London for 100 days and 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in other regions potentially limit the total deaths in the UK to 33.8 thousand. Future research on how to quantify and measure intervention activities could improve precision on control estimates.","Yang, P.; Qi, J.; Zhang, S.; Bi, G.; Wang, X.; Yang, Y.; Sheng, B.; Mao, X.",2020-04-14,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.05.20054429,2,Po Yang,The University of Sheffield,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054429v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054429v2.full.pdf,cc_by,"NA"
9833,Predictors of CPAP outcome in hospitalised COVID-19 patients,"IntroductionThroughout March - April 2020, many patients with COVID-19 presented to Southend University Hospital with Acute Hypoxaemic Respiratory Failure (AHRF). Patients were managed in a Specialist Respiratory High Dependency Unit. We present our experience on the usage of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy and possible indicators of its success in this patient group.

MethodsData from patients (n=89) requiring mechanical ventilation during the months of March-April 2020, were retrospectively collected and analysed. 37 patients received IMV (Invasive Mechanical Ventilation) without a CPAP trial beforehand. 52 patients underwent a CPAP trial, of which 21 patients successfully avoided intubation and ITU admission.

ResultsThe 52 patients, prior to receiving CPAP had significant respiratory failure as evidenced by a low PaO2: FiO2 (PFR) (mean{+/-} SD 123 {+/-} 60 mmHg) and mean SpO2:FiO2 (SFR) (mean {+/-} SD: 140 {+/-} 50). The main indicators of CPAP success were: higher SFR before and after CPAP, lower respiratory rate (RR), lower Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and higher PFR prior to CPAP.

DiscussionCPAP proved successful in 40% of COVID-19 patients presenting with AHRF. SFR, PFR, RR and NLR are predictors of such success. SFR can be used for effective real time monitoring of patients before and after CPAP to identify likelihood of success. Based on our results, we have suggested a modified CPAP management protocol in COVID-19. These findings can guide future studies and will allow improved triage of patients to either CPAP or IMV, in the event of a future COVID peak.","Ahmed, Y.

23021,Interpreting vaccine efficacy trial results for infection and transmission,"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown high efficacy of multiple vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19), and recent studies have shown the vaccines are also effective against infection. Evidence for the effect of each of these vaccines on ability to transmit the virus is also beginning to emerge. We describe an approach to estimate these vaccines effects on viral positivity, a prevalence measure which under the reasonable assumption that vaccinated individuals who become infected are no more infectious than unvaccinated individuals forms a lower bound on efficacy against transmission. Specifically, we recommend separate analysis of positive tests triggered by symptoms (usually the primary outcome) and cross-sectional prevalence of positive tests obtained regardless of symptoms. The odds ratio of carriage for vaccine vs. placebo provides an unbiased estimate of vaccine effectiveness against viral positivity, under certain assumptions, and we show through simulations that likely departures from these assumptions will only modestly bias this estimate. Applying this approach to published data from the RCT of the Moderna vaccine, we estimate that one dose of vaccine reduces the potential for transmission by at least 61%, possibly considerably more. We describe how these approaches can be translated into observational studies of vaccine effectiveness.

HighlightsO_LISARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials did not directly estimate vaccine efficacy against transmission.
C_LIO_LIWe describe an approach to estimate a lower bound of vaccine efficacy against transmission.
C_LIO_LIWe estimate one dose of the Moderna vaccine reduces the potential for transmission by at least 61%.

16587,"Maternal health care services utilization in the amid of COVID-19 pandemic in West Shoa Zone, Central Ethiopia","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Despite strong efforts that have been taking place to control the pandemic globally, the virus is on the rise in many countries. Hence, this study assessed the maternal health care services utilization in the amid of the COVID-19 pandemic in West Shoa Zone, Central Ethiopia. Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 844 pregnant women or those gave birth in the last 6 months before the study. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select the study participants. The data were collected through face-to-face interview using a semi-structured questionnaire. Logistic regressions were performed to identify the presence of significant associations, and adjusted odds ratio with 95%CI was employed for the strength and directions of association between the independent and outcome variables. A P-value of <0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. The prevalence of maternal health service utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic was 64.8%. The odds of maternal health service utilization was higher among mothers who had primary (AOR=2.16, 95%CI: 1.29-3.60), secondary (AOR=1.97, 95%CI: 1.13-3.44), and college and above education (AOR=2.89, 95%CI: 1.34-6.22) than those who could not read and write. In addition, mothers who did travel 25-74 km (AOR= 0.37, 95%CI: 0.23-0.59) and 75-99 km (AOR= 0.10, 95%CI: 0.05-0.19) to reach health facility had a lower odds of maternal health service utilization than those who did travel < 24 km.

9933,Identifiability of infection model parameters early in an epidemic,"It is known that the parameters in the deterministic and stochastic SEIR epidemic models are structurally identifiable. For example, from knowledge of the infected population time series I(t) during the entire epidemic, the parameters can be successfully estimated. In this article we observe that estimation will fail in practice if only infected case data during the early part of the epidemic (pre-peak) is available. This fact can be explained using a long-known phenomenon called dynamical compensation. We use this concept to derive an unidentifiability manifold in the parameter space of SEIR that consists of parameters indistin-guishable to I(t) early in the epidemic. Thus, identifiability depends on the extent of the system trajectory that is available for observation. Although the existence of the unidentifiability manifold obstructs the ability to exactly determine the parameters, we suggest that it may be useful for uncertainty quantification purposes. A variant of SEIR recently proposed for COVID-19 modeling is also analyzed, and an analogous unidentifiability surface is derived.","Sauer, T.; Berry, T.; Ebeigbe, D.; Norton, M.

5879,Incidence of COVID-19 and Connections with Air Pollution Exposure: Evidence from the Netherlands,"The fast spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has resulted in the emergence of several hot-spots around the world. Several of these are located in areas associated with high levels of air pollution. This study investigates the relationship between exposure to particulate matter and COVID-19 incidence in 355 municipalities in the Netherlands. The results show that atmospheric particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 is a highly significant predictor of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and related hospital admissions. The estimates suggest that expected COVID-19 cases increase by nearly 100 percent when pollution concentrations increase by 20 percent. The association between air pollution and case incidence is robust in the presence of data on health-related preconditions, proxies for symptom severity, and demographic control variables. The results are obtained with ground-measurements and satellite-derived measures of atmospheric particulate matter as well as COVID-19 data from alternative dates. The findings call for further investigation into the association between air pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. If particulate matter plays a significant role in COVID-19 incidence, it has strong implications for the mitigation strategies required to prevent spreading.

HighlightsO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSResearch on viral respiratory infections has found that infection risks increase following exposure to high concentrations of particulate matter. Several hot-spots of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 infections are in areas associated with high levels of air pollution.

ApproachThis study investigates the relationship between exposure to particulate matter and COVID-19 incidence in 355 municipalities in the Netherlands using data on confirmed cases and hospital admissions coded by residence, along with local PM2.5, PM10, population density, demographics and health-related pre-conditions. The analysis utilizes different regression specifications that allow for spatial dependence, nonlinearity, alternative error distributions and outlier treatment.

ResultsPM2.5 is a highly significant predictor of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and related hospital admissions. Taking the WHO guideline of 10mcg/m3 as a baseline, the estimates suggest that expected COVID-19 cases increase by nearly 100% when pollution concentrations increase by 20%.

ConclusionThe findings call for further investigation into the association between air pollution on SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. If particulate matter plays a significant role in the incidence of COVID-19 disease, it has strong implications for the mitigation strategies required to prevent spreading, particularly in areas that have high levels of pollution.","Andree, B.

24133,T-cell receptor sequencing identifies prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and correlates with neutralizing antibody titers and disease severity,"Measuring the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 can enable the assessment of past infection as well as protective immunity and the risk of reinfection. While neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers are one measure of protection, such assays are challenging to perform at a large scale and the longevity of the SARS-CoV-2 nAb response is not fully understood. Here, we apply a T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing assay that can be performed on a small volume standard blood sample to assess the adaptive T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Samples were collected from a cohort of 302 individuals recovered from COVID-19 up to 6 months after infection. Previously published findings in this cohort showed that two commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays correlate well with nAb testing. We demonstrate that the magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell response strongly correlates with nAb titer, as well as clinical indicators of disease severity including hospitalization, fever, or difficulty breathing. While the depth and breadth of the T-cell response declines during convalescence, the T-cell signal remains well above background with high sensitivity up to at least 6 months following initial infection. Compared to serology tests detecting binding antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleoprotein, the overall sensitivity of the TCR-based assay across the entire cohort and all timepoints was approximately 5% greater for identifying prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, the improved performance of T-cell testing compared to serology was most apparent in recovered individuals who were not hospitalized and were sampled beyond 150 days of their initial illness, suggesting that antibody testing may have reduced sensitivity in individuals who experienced less severe COVID-19 illness and at later timepoints. Finally, T-cell testing was able to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection in 68% (55/81) of convalescent samples having nAb titers below the lower limit of detection, as well as 37% (13/35) of samples testing negative by all three antibody assays. These results demonstrate the utility of a TCR-based assay as a scalable, reliable measure of past SARS-CoV-2 infection across a spectrum of disease severity. Additionally, the TCR repertoire may be useful as a surrogate for protective immunity with additive clinical value beyond serologic or nAb testing methods.","Elyanow, R.; Snyder, T. M.; Dalai, S.

14771,Superspreaders and High Variance Infectious Diseases,"(Dated: September 6, 2020)

A well-known characteristic of pandemics such as COVID-19 is the high level of transmission heterogeneity in the infection spread: not all infected individuals spread the disease at the same rate and some individuals (superspreaders) are responsible for most of the infections. To quantify this phenomenon requires the analysis of the effect of the variance and higher moments of the infection distribution. Working in the framework of stochastic branching processes, we derive an approximate analytical formula for the probability of an outbreak in the high variance regime of the infection distribution, verify it numerically and analyze its regime of validity in various examples. We show that it is possible for an outbreak not to occur in the high variance regime even when the basic reproduction number R0 is larger than one and discuss the implications of our results for COVID-19 and other pandemics.

6988,Lessons from a rapid systematic review of early SARS-CoV-2 serosurveys,"BackgroundAs the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, there is increasing global interest in the role of serological testing for population monitoring and to inform public policy. However, limitations in serological study designs and test standards raise concerns about the validity of seroprevalence estimates and their utility in decision-making. There is now a critical window of opportunity to learn from early SARS-CoV-2 serology studies. We aimed to synthesize the results of SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance projects from around the world and provide recommendations to improve the coordination, strategy, and methodology of future serosurveillance efforts.

MethodsThis was a rapid systematic review of cross-sectional and cohort studies reporting seroprevalence outcomes for SARS-CoV 2. We included completed, ongoing, and proposed serosurveys. The search included electronic databases (PubMed, MedRXIV, BioRXIV, and WHO ICTPR); five medical journals (NEJM, BMJ, JAMA, The Lancet, Annals of Internal Medicine); reports by governments, NGOs, and health systems; and media reports (Google News) from December 1, 2019 to May 1, 2020. We extracted data on study characteristics and critically appraised prevalence estimates using Joanna Briggs Institute criteria.

ResultsSeventy records met inclusion criteria, describing 73 studies. Of these, 23 reported prevalence estimates: eight preprints, 14 news articles, and one government report. These studies had a total sample size of 35,784 and reported 42 prevalence estimates. Seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.4% to 59.3%. No estimates were found to have a low risk of bias (43% high risk, 21% moderate risk, 36% unclear). Fifty records reported characteristics of ongoing or proposed serosurveys. Overall, twenty countries have completed, ongoing, or proposed serosurveys.

DiscussionStudy design, quality, and prevalence estimates of early SARS-CoV2 serosurveys are heterogeneous, suggesting that the urgency to examine seroprevalence may have compromised methodological rigour. Based on the limitations of included studies, future serosurvey investigators and stakeholders should ensure that: i) serological tests used undergo high-quality independent evaluations that include cross-reactivity; ii) all reports of serosurvey results, including media, describe the test used, sample size, and sampling method; and iii) initiatives are coordinated to prevent test fatigue, minimize redundant efforts, and encourage better study methodology.

16909,"Quantifying Asymptomatic Infection and Transmission of COVID-19 in New York City using Observed Cases, Serology and Testing Capacity","The contributions of asymptomatic infections to herd immunity and community transmission are key to the resurgence and control of COVID-19, but are difficult to estimate using current models that ignore changes in testing capacity. Using a model that incorporates daily testing information fit to the case and serology data from New York City, we show that the proportion of symptomatic cases is low, ranging from 13% to 18%, and that the reproductive number may be larger than often assumed. Asymptomatic infections contribute substantially to herd immunity, and to community transmission together with pre-symptomatic ones. If asymptomatic infections transmit at similar rates than symptomatic ones, the overall reproductive number across all classes is larger than often assumed, with estimates ranging from 3.2 to 4.4. If they transmit poorly, then symptomatic cases have a larger reproductive number ranging from 3.9 to 8.1. Even in this regime, pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases together comprise at least 50% of the force of infection at the outbreak peak. We find no regimes in which all infection sub-populations have reproductive numbers lower than 3. These findings elucidate the uncertainty that current case and serology data cannot resolve, despite consideration of different model structures. They also emphasize how temporal data on testing can reduce and better define this uncertainty, as we move forward through longer surveillance and second epidemic waves. Complementary information is required to determine the transmissibility of asymptomatic cases, which we discuss. Regardless, current assumptions about the basic reproductive number of SARS-Cov-2 should be reconsidered.

Significance StatementAs health officials face another wave of COVID-19, they require estimates of the proportion of infected cases that develop symptoms, and the extent to which symptomatic and asymptomatic cases contribute to community transmission. Recent asymptomatic testing guidelines are ambiguous. Using an epidemiological model that includes testing capacity, we show that most infections are asymptomatic but contribute substantially to community transmission in the aggregate. Their individual transmissibility remains uncertain. If they transmit as well as symptomatic infections, the epidemic may spread at faster rates than current models often assume. If they do not, then each symptomatic case generates on average a higher number of secondary infections than typically assumed. Regardless, controlling transmission requires community-wide interventions informed by extensive, well-documented asymptomatic testing.","Subramanian, R.; He, Q.; Pascual, M.",2020-10-20,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.10.16.20214049,1,Mercedes Pascual,University of Chicago,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.16.20214049v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.16.20214049v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1073/pnas.2019716118

18452,SARS-CoV-2 epidemic after social and economic reopening in three US states reveals shifts in age structure and clinical characteristics,"In the United States, state-level re-openings in spring 2020 presented an opportunity for the resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. One important question during this time was whether human contact and mixing patterns could increase gradually without increasing viral transmission, the rationale being that new mixing patterns would likely be associated with improved distancing, masking, and hygiene practices. A second key question to follow during this time was whether clinical characteristics of the epidemic would improve after the initial surge of cases. Here, we analyze age-structured case, hospitalization, and death time series from three states - Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania - that had successful re-openings in May 2020 without summer waves of infection. Using a Bayesian inference framework on eleven daily data streams and flexible daily population contact parameters, we show that population-average mixing rates dropped by >50% during the lockdown period in March/April, and that the correlation between overall population mobility and transmission-capable mobility was broken in May as these states partially re-opened. We estimate the reporting rates (fraction of symptomatic cases reporting to health system) at 96.0% (RI), 72.1% (MA), and 75.5% (PA); in Rhode Island, when accounting for cases caught through general-population screening programs, the reporting rate estimate is 94.5%. We show that elderly individuals were less able to reduce contacts during the lockdown period when compared to younger individuals, leading to the outbreak being concentrated in elderly congregate settings despite the lockdown. Attack rate estimates through August 31 2020 are 6.4% (95% CI: 5.8% - 7.3%) of the total population infected for Rhode Island, 5.7% (95% CI: 5.0% - 6.8%) in Massachusetts, and 3.7% (95% CI: 3.1% - 4.5%) in Pennsylvania, with some validation available through published seroprevalence studies. Infection fatality rates (IFR) estimates are higher in our analysis (>2%) than previously reported values, likely resulting from the epidemics in these three states affecting the most vulnerable sub-populations, especially the most vulnerable of the [&ge;]80 age group.

10158,Clinical Outcomes of Patients with COVID-19 and Chronic Inflammatory and Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases: A Multicentric Matched-Cohort Study,"BackgroundThe impact of inflammatory rheumatic diseases on COVID-19 severity is poorly known. Here we compare the outcomes of a cohort of rheumatic patients with a matched control cohort to identify potential risk factors for severe illness.

MethodsIn this comparative cohort study, we identified hospital PCR+ COVID-19 rheumatic patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis (IA) or autoimmune/immunomediated diseases (AI/IMID). Non-rheumatic controls were randomly sampled 1:1, and matched by age, sex, and PCR date. The main outcome was severe COVID-19, defined as death, invasive ventilation, ICU admission, or serious complications. We assessed the association between the outcome and potential prognostic variables, adjusted by COVID treatment, using logistic regression.

ResultsThe cohorts were composed of 456 rheumatic and non-rheumatic patients, in equal numbers. Mean age was 63 [IQR 53-78] and male sex 41% in both cohorts. Rheumatic diseases were IA (60%) and AI/IMID (40%). Most patients (74%) had been hospitalised, and the risk of severe COVID was 31.6% in the rheumatic and 28.1% in the non-rheumatic cohort. Ageing, male sex and previous comorbidity (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular, or lung disease) increased the risk in the rheumatic cohort by bivariate analysis. In logistic regression analysis, independent factors associated with severe COVID were increased age (OR 5.31; CI 3.14-8.95), male sex (2.13; CI 1.35-3.36) and having an AI/IMID (OR 1.98; CI 1.15-3.41).

As of Mid-June 2021, over 1500 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced across the country. From our analyses, it was discovered that the wave-2 samples had a significantly greater average rate of mutation/sample (30.79%) than the wave-1 samples (12.32%). Wave-2 samples also had a higher frequency of deletion, and transversion events. During the first wave, the GR clade was the most predominant but it was replaced by the GH clade in the latter wave. The B.1.1.25 variant showed the highest frequency in wave-1 while in case of wave-2, the B.1.351.3 variant, was the most common one. A notable presence of the delta variant, which is currently at the center of concern, was also observed. Comparison of the Spike protein found in the reference and the 3 most common lineages found in Bangladesh namely, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.617 in terms of their ability to form stable complexes with ACE2 receptor revealed that B.1.617 had the potential to be more transmissible than others.

4711,Faecal immunochemical testing (FIT): Sources of analytical variation based on three years of routine testing in the context of DG30,"AimsTo determine analytical capabilities of a commonly used faecal immunochemical test (FIT) to detect haemoglobin (Hb) in the context of NICE guidance DG30, and the likely use of FIT to reprioritise patients delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsData obtained from independent verification studies and clinical testing of the HM-JACKarc FIT method in routine primary care practice were analysed to derive analytical performance characteristics.

ResultsDetection capabilities for the FIT method were 0.5 {micro}g/g (limit of blank), 1.1 (limit of detection) and 15.0 {micro}g/g (limit of quantification). 31 of 33 (94%) non-homogenised specimens analysed in triplicate were consistently categorised relative to 10 {micro}g/g compared to all 33 (100%) homogenised specimens. Imprecision in non-homogenised specimens was higher (median 27.8%, (range 20.5% - 48.6%)) than in homogenised specimens (10.2%, (7.0 to 13.5%)). Considerable variation was observed in sequential clinical specimens from individual patients but no positive or negative trend in specimen degradation was observed (p=0.26).

ConclusionsThe FIT method is capable of detecting Hb at concentrations well below the DG30 threshold of 10 {micro}g/g. However, total imprecision is considerable when including sampling variation. Binary categorisation against a single defined threshold above and below 10 {micro}g/g was more consistent and improved following specimen homogenisation. This approach may be more appropriate when reporting results for symptomatic patients tested in primary care, including those who have had definitive investigation delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and need to be re-prioritised.

Key MessagesFaecal immunochemical testing (FIT) is increasingly used to detect blood at low haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations in specimens from symptomatic primary care patients but the analytical characteristics in this context have not been fully documented.

A commonly used FIT method showed good capability in a routine UK clinical setting to detect Hb at the NICE recommended threshold of 10{micro}g/g. Imprecision estimates were considerable when sampling was considered, even above the limit of quantification of 15 {micro}g/g.

Analytical variability appears too high for reliable reporting of quantitative Hb concentrations: reporting positive or negative results around a threshold of 10{micro}g/g appears more appropriate after sample homogenisation.

Dichotomous FIT reporting is likely to be an important tool to risk stratify patients with lower GI cancer symptoms who have had their test deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic","James, T.

DesignProspective national population-based cohort study using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS).

SettingAll 194 obstetric units in the UK

Participants427 pregnant women admitted to hospital with confirmed Sars-CoV-2 infection between 01/03/2020 and 14/04/2020. 694 comparison women who gave birth between 01/11/2017 and 31/10/2018.

Main outcome measuresIncidence of maternal hospitalisation, infant infection. Rates of maternal death, level 3 critical care unit admission, preterm birth, stillbirth, early neonatal death, perinatal death; odds ratios for infected versus comparison women.

ResultsEstimated incidence of hospitalisation with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy 4.9 per 1000 maternities (95%CI 4.5-5.4). The median gestation at symptom onset was 34 weeks (IQR 29-38). Black or other minority ethnicity (aOR 4.49, 95%CI 3.37-6.00), older maternal age (aOR 1.35, 95%CI 1.01-1.81 comparing women aged 35+ with those aged 30-34), overweight and obesity (aORs 1.91, 95%CI 1.37-2.68 and 2.20, 95%CI 1.56-3.10 respectively compared to women with a BMI<25kg/m2) and pre-existing comorbidities (aOR 1.52, 95%CI 1.12-2.06) were associated with admission with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. 247 women (58%) gave birth or had a pregnancy loss; 180 (73%) gave birth at term. 40 (9%) hospitalised women required respiratory support. Twelve infants (5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, six of these infants within the first 12 hours after birth.

ConclusionsThe majority of pregnant women hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 were in the late second or third trimester, supporting guidance for continued social distancing measures in later pregnancy. Most had good outcomes and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to infants was uncommon.

6308,Functional alteration of innate T cells in critically ill Covid-19 patients,"Covid-19 can induce lung infection ranging from mild pneumonia to life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Dysregulated host immune response in the lung is a key feature in ARDS pathophysiology. However, cellular actors in Covid-19-driven ARDS are poorly understood. Here, we dynamically analyzed the biology of innate T cells, a heterogeneous class (MAIT, {gamma}{delta}T and iNKT cells) of T lymphocytes, presenting potent anti-infective and regulatory functions. Patients presented a compartmentalized lung inflammation paralleled with a limited systemic inflammation. Circulating innate T cells of critically ill Covid-19 patients presented a profound and persistent phenotypic and functional alteration. Highly activated innate T cells were detected in airways of patients suggesting a recruitment to the inflamed site and a potential contribution in the regulation of the local inflammation. Finally, the expression of the CD69 activation marker on blood iNKT and MAIT cells at inclusion was predictive of disease severity. Thus, patients present an altered innate T cell biology that may account for the dysregulated immune response observed in Covid-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Jouan, Y.; Guillon, A.; Gonzalez, L.; Perez, Y.; Ehrmann, S.; Ferreira, M.; Daix, T.; Jeannet, R.; Francois, B.; Dequin, P.-F.; Si-Tahar, M.; Baranek, T.; Paget, C.",2020-05-06,Intensive Care And Critical Care Medicine,10.1101/2020.05.03.20089300,1,Christophe Paget,Inserm U1100,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089300v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089300v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
21800,Viral sequencing reveals US healthcare personnel rarely become infected with SARS-CoV-2 through patient contact,"BackgroundHealthcare personnel (HCP) are at increased risk of infection with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2019 virus (SARS-CoV-2). Between 12 March 2020 and 10 January 2021, >1,170 HCP tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a major academic medical institution in the Upper Midwest of the United States. We aimed to understand the sources of infections in HCP and to evaluate the efficacy of infection control procedures used at this institution to protect HCP from healthcare-associated transmission.

MethodsIn this retrospective case series, we used viral genomics to investigate the likely source of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 96 HCP where epidemiological data alone could not be used to rule out healthcare-associated transmission. We obtained limited epidemiological data through informal interviews and review of the electronic health record. We combined viral sequence data and available epidemiological information to infer the most likely source of HCP infection.

FindingsWe investigated 32 SARS-CoV-2 infection clusters involving 96 HCP, 140 possible patient contacts, and 1 household contact (total n = 237). Of these, 182 sequences met quality standards and were used for downstream analysis. We found the majority of HCP infections could not be linked to a patient or co-worker and therefore likely occurred in the outside community (58/96; 60.4%). We found a smaller percentage could be traced to a coworker (10/96; 10.4%) or were part of a patient-employee cluster (12/96; 12.5%). Strikingly, the smallest proportion of HCP infections could be clearly traced to a patient source (4/96; 4.2%).

InterpretationInfection control procedures, consistently followed, offer significant protection to HCP caring for COVID-19 patients in a representative American academic medical institution. Rapid SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing in healthcare settings can be used retrospectively to reconstruct the likely source of HCP infection when epidemiological data are not available or are inconclusive. Understanding the source of SARS-CoV-2 infection can then be used prospectively to adjust and improve infection control practices and guidelines.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSOn 16 January 2021 we searched for """"SARS-CoV-2"""" AND """"healthcare workers"""" AND """"viral sequencing"""" in Google Scholar. This search returned 57 results, and included a number of preprint articles. We found two studies that used viral sequencing to investigate healthcare-associated outbreaks in the Netherlands 1 and the United Kingdom 2. To our knowledge, no study has used viral sequencing to specifically investigate the source of SARS-CoV-2 infections in healthcare workers in the United States. Although we and others have written about the potential utility of sequencing as an infection control asset 3-6, few have demonstrated the practical application of such efforts.

Added value of this studyOur study suggests infection control measures in place at the institution evaluated in this case series are largely protecting healthcare personnel (HCP) from healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 infections. Even so, the majority of healthcare-associated infections we did identify appeared to be linked to HCP-to-HCP spread so additional messaging and guidelines to reduce HCP-to-HCP spread in and out of the workplace may be warranted. In addition, we demonstrated how rapid viral sequencing can be combined with, even limited, epidemiological information to reconstruct healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.

Implications of all the available evidenceHealthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 infections negatively affect HCP, patients, and communities. Infections among HCP add further strain to the healthcare system and put patients and other HCP at risk. We found the majority of HCP infections appeared to be acquired through community exposure so measures to reduce community spread are critical. This further emphasizes the importance of mask-wearing, physical distancing, robust testing programs, and the rapid distribution of vaccines.","Braun, K. M.; Moreno, G.

9041,"An Agent Based Model for assessing spread and health systems burden for COVID-19 in Rangareddy district, Telangana state, India","ObjectivesTo evaluate the transmission dynamics and health systems burden of COVID-19 with and without interventions, using an Agent Based Modeling (ABM) approach on a localized synthetic population.

Study designA synthetic population of Rangareddy district, Telangana state, India, with 5,48,323 agents and simulated using an ABM approach for three different scenarios.

MethodsThe patterns and trends of the COVID-19 in terms of infected, admitted, critical cases requiring intensive care and/ or ventilator support, mortality and recovery were examined. The model was simulated over a period of 365 days for a no lockdown scenario and two Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention (NPI) scenarios i.e., 50% lockdown and 75% lockdown scenarios.

ResultsResults revealed that the peak values and slope of the curve declined as NPI became more stringent. The peak values could facilitate policymakers to plan the required capacity to accommodate influx of hospitalizations.

ConclusionsABM provides better insight into projections compared to compartmental models. The results could provide a platform for researchers and modelers to explore using ABM approach for COVID-19 projections with inclusion of interventions and health system preparedness.","Ms, N.; Jammy, G.

11131,Evaluation of a genetic risk score for severity of COVID-19 using human chromosomal-scale length variation.,"IntroductionThe course of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic to severe (acute respiratory distress, cytokine storms, and death) in patients. The basis for this range in symptoms is unknown. One possibility is that genetic variation is responsible for the highly variable response to infection. We evaluated how well a genetic risk score based on chromosome-scale length variation and machine learning classification algorithms could predict severity of response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsWe compared 981 patients from the UK Biobank dataset who had a severe reaction to SARS-COV-2 infection before 27 April 2020 to a similar number of age matched patients drawn for the general UK Biobank population. For each patient, we built a profile of 88 numbers characterizing the chromosome-scale length variability of their germ line DNA. Each number represented one quarter of the 22 autosomes. We used the machine learning algorithm XGBoost to build a classifier that could predict whether a person would have a severe reaction to Covid-19 based only on their 88-number classification.

ResultsWe found that the XGBoost classifier could differentiate between the two classes at a significant level p = 2 {middle dot} 10 as measured against a randomized control and p = 3 {middle dot} 10 measured against the expected value of a random guessing algorithm (AUC=0.5). However, we found that the AUC of the classifier was only 0.51, too low for a clinically useful test.

6184,Evaluating efficiency of pooling specimens for PCR-based detection of COVID-19,"In the age of a pandemic, such as the ongoing one caused by SARS-CoV-2, the world faces limited supply of tests, PPE and reagents, and factories are struggling to meet the growing demands. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of pooling specimen for testing of SARS-CoV-2 virus, to determine whether costs and resource savings could be achieved without impacting the sensitivity of the testing. Ten specimens were pooled for testing, containing either one or two known positive specimen of varying viral concentrations. Pooling specimens did not affect the sensitivity of detecting SARS-CoV-2, and the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) between testing of pooling specimen and subsequent individual testing was not significantly different using paired t-test. This study also identified cost savings garnered from pooling of specimen for testing at 4 differing prevalence rates, ranging from 0.1-10%. Pooling specimens to test for COVID-19 infection in low prevalence areas or in low risk population can dramatically decrease the resources burden on lab operations by up to 80%. This paves the possibility for large-scale population screening, allowing for assured policy decisions by governmental bodies to ease lockdown restrictions in areas with low incidence of infection, or with lower risk populations.","Wacharapluesadee, S.; Kaewpom, T.; Ampoot, W.; Ghai, S.; Khamhang, W.; Worachotsueptrakun, K.; Wanthong, P.; Nopvichai, C.; Supharatpariyakorn, T.; Putcharoen, O.; Paitoonpong, L.; Suwanpimolkul, G.; Jantarabenjakul, W.; Hemachudha, P.; Krichphiphat, A.; Buathong, R.; Plipat, T.; Hemachudha, T.",2020-05-06,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.02.20087221,1,Supaporn Wacharapluesadee,"Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Centre, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, K",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.02.20087221v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.02.20087221v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1002/jmv.26005
3678,Case fatality rate in COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundEstimating the prevalence of severe or critical illness and case fatality of COVID-19 outbreak in December, 2019 remains a challenge due to biases associated with surveillance, data synthesis and reporting. We aimed to address this limitation in a systematic review and meta-analysis and to examine the clinical, biochemical and radiological risk factors in a meta-regression.

MethodsPRISMA guidelines were followed. PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched using pre-specified keywords on March 07, 2020. Peer-reviewed empirical studies examining rates of severe illness, critical illness and case fatality among COVID-19 patients were examined. Numerators and denominators to compute the prevalence rates and risk factors were extracted. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed. Results were corrected for publication bias. Meta-regression analyses examined the moderator effects of potential risk factors.

ResultsThe meta-analysis included 29 studies representing 2,090 individuals. Pooled rates of severe illness, critical illness and case fatality among COVID-19 patients were 15%, 5% and 0.8% respectively. Adjusting for potential underreporting and publication bias, increased these estimates to 26%, 16% and 7.4% respectively. Increasing age and elevated LDH consistently predicted severe / critical disease and case fatality. Hypertension; fever and dyspnea at presentation; and elevated CRP predicted increased severity.

ConclusionsRisk factors that emerged in our analyses predicting severity and case fatality should inform clinicians to define endophenotypes possessing a greater risk. Estimated case fatality rate of 7.4% after correcting for publication bias underscores the importance of strict adherence to preventive measures, case detection, surveillance and reporting.","Kahathuduwa, C.

11251,Ranking the effectiveness of worldwide COVID-19 government interventions,"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 were often implemented under considerable uncertainty and a lack of scientific evidence. Assessing the effectiveness of the individual interventions is critical to inform future preparedness response plans. Here we quantify the impact of 4,579 NPIs implemented in 76 territories on the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19. We use a hierarchically coded data set of NPIs and propose a novel modelling approach that combines four computational techniques, which together allow for a worldwide consensus rank of the NPIs based on their effectiveness in mitigating the spread of COVID-19. We show how the effectiveness of individual NPIs strongly varies across countries and world regions, and in relation to human and economic development as well as different dimensions of governance. We quantify the effectiveness of each NPI with respect to the epidemic age of its adoption, i.e., how early into the epidemics. The emerging picture is one in which no one-fits-all solution exists, and no single NPI alone can decrease Rt below one and that a combination of NPIs is necessary to curb the spread of the virus. We show that there are NPIs considerably less intrusive and costly than lockdowns that are also highly effective, such as certain risk communication strategies and voluntary measures that strengthen the healthcare system. By allowing to simulate """"what-if"""" scenarios at the country level, our approach opens the way for planning the most likely effectiveness of future NPIs.","Haug, N.; Geyrhofer, L.; Londei, A.; Dervic, E.; Desvars-Larrive, A.; Loreto, V.; Pinior, B.; Thurner, S.; Klimek, P.",2020-10-05,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.06.20147199,2,Peter Klimek,Medical University of Vienna,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147199v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147199v2.full.pdf,cc_by,"NA"

Structural inequalities have increased the likelihood of immigrants contracting COVID-19, by being essential workers and through poverty that forces this population to continue working. Rural and urban immigrant families may face different concerns. Using a telephone survey in May 2020 of 105 Latinx families in an existing study, quantitative and qualitative data were gathered on work and household economics, childcare and education, healthcare, and community climate. Analyses show that, although rural and urban groups experienced substantial economic effects, impacts were more acute for urban families. Rural workers reported fewer workplace protective measures for COVID-19. For both groups, fear and worry, particularly about finances and children, dominated reports of their situations with numerous reports of experiencing stress and anxiety. The experience of the pandemic is interpreted as an example of contextual vulnerability of a population already experiencing structural violence through social injustice.","Quandt, S. A.; Lamonto, N.

5161,Estimating the burden of SARS-CoV-2 in France,"France has been heavily affected by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and went into lockdown on the 17th March 2020. Using models applied to hospital and death data, we estimate the impact of the lockdown and current population immunity. We find 2.6% of infected individuals are hospitalized and 0.53% die, ranging from 0.001% in those <20y to 8.3% in those >80y. Across all ages, men are more likely to be hospitalized, enter intensive care, and die than women. The lockdown reduced the reproductive number from 3.3 to 0.5 (84% reduction). By 11 May, when interventions are scheduled to be eased, we project 3.7 million (range: 2.3-6.7) people, 5.7% of the population, will have been infected.

1519,Estimated effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent international spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),"Traveller screening is being used to limit further global spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) following its recent emergence. Here, we project the impact of different travel screening programs given remaining uncertainty around the values of key nCoV life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected travellers. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. These findings emphasize the need for measures to track travellers who become ill after being missed by a travel screening program. We make our model available for interactive use so stakeholders can explore scenarios of interest using the most up-to-date information. We hope these findings contribute to evidence-based policy to combat the spread of nCoV, and to prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.","Gostic, K.; Gomez, A. C. R.; Mummah, R.

19557,Effects of photobiomodulation therapy combined with static magnetic field (PBMT-sMF) in patients with severe COVID-19 requiring intubation: a pragmatic randomized placebo-controlled trial,"BackgroundPhotobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) when used isolated or combined with static magnetic field (PBMT-sMF) has been proven benefits on skeletal muscle increasing performance and reducing fatigue, increasing oxygen saturation, and modulating inflammatory process. However, it is unknown whether the effects observed with this therapy on respiratory muscles will be similar to the effects previously observed on skeletal muscles.

ObjectiveWe aimed to investigate whether PBMT-sMF is able to decrease the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to reduce the mortality rate of patients with severe COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, increasing the respiratory function and modulating the inflammatory process.

MethodsWe conducted a prospectively registered, pragmatic, triple-blinded (patients, therapists and outcome assessors), randomized, placebo-controlled trial of PBMT-sMF in patients with severe COVID-19, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, admitted to the ICU. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either PBMT-sMF (6 sites at the lower thorax - 189 J total, and 2 sites at the neck area - 63 J total) or placebo PBMT-sMF daily during all the ICU stay. The primary outcome was length of stay in the ICU defined by either discharge or death. The secondary outcomes were survival rate, muscle function of diaphragm, change in blood tests, change in mechanical ventilation parameters and change in arterial blood gas analysis.

ResultsA total of 30 patients underwent randomization (with 15 assigned to PBMT-sMF and 15 to placebo) and were analyzed. The length of stay in the ICU for the placebo group was 23.06 days while for the PBMT-sMF group was 16.26. However, there was no statistically difference between groups for the length of stay in the ICU (mean difference - MD = - 6.80; 95% CI = - 18.71 to 5.11). Regarding the secondary outcomes were observed statistically differences in favor of PBMT-sMF for diaphragm thickness, fraction of inspired oxygen, partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio, C-reactive protein, lymphocytes count, and hemoglobin (p<0.05).

ConclusionAmong patients with severe COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, PBMT-sMF was not statistically different than placebo to the length of stay in the ICU. However, it is important to highlight that our sample size was underpowered to detect statistical differences to the primary outcome. In contrast, PBMT-sMF increased muscle function of diaphragm, improved ventilatory parameters, decreased C-reactive protein levels and hemoglobin count, and increased lymphocytes count.","De Marchi, T.; Francio, F.; Ferlito, J.

6895,Forecasting Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19 Epidemic in India under Various Containment Measures- A Time-Dependent State-Space SIR Approach,"ObjectivesOur primary objective is to predict the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic in India while adjusting for the effects of various progressively implemented containment measures. Apart from forecasting the major turning points and parameters associated with the epidemic, we intend to provide an epidemiological assessment of the impact of these containment measures in India.

MethodsWe propose a method based on time-series SIR model to estimate time-dependent modifiers for transmission rate of the infection. These modifiers are used in state-space SIR model to estimate reproduction number R0, expected total incidence, and to forecast the daily prevalence till the end of the epidemic. We consider four different scenarios, two based on current developments and two based on hypothetical situations for the purpose of comparison.

ResultsAssuming gradual relaxation in lockdown post 17 May 2020, we expect the prevalence of infecteds to cross 9 million, with at least 1 million severe cases, around the end of October 2020. For the same case, estimates of R0 for the phases no-intervention, partial-lockdown and lockdown are 4.46 (7.1), 1.47 (2.33), and 0.817 (1.29) respectively, assuming 14-day (24-day) infectious period.

ConclusionsEstimated modifiers give consistent estimates of unadjusted R0 across different scenarios, demonstrating precision. Results corroborate the effectiveness of lockdown measures in substantially reducing R0. Also, predictions are highly sensitive towards estimate of infectious period.","Deo, V.; Chetiya, A.

Here, we describe a digital warm-start CRISPR (WS-CRISPR) assay for sensitive quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. The WS-CRISPR assay combines low-temperature reverse transcription dual-priming mediated isothermal amplification (RT-DAMP) and CRISPR-Cas12a-based detection in one-pot, attributed to the mediation role by pyrophosphatase and phosphorothioated primers. The WS-CRISPR assay is initiated at above 50 {degrees}C and overcomes undesired premature target amplification at room temperature, enabling accurate digital nucleic acid quantification. By targeting SARS-CoV-2s nucleoprotein gene, digital WS-CRISPR assay is able to detect down to 5 copies/l SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the chip within 90 minutes. It is clinically validated by quantitatively determining 32 clinical swab samples and three clinical saliva samples, showing 100% agreement with RT-PCR results. Moreover, the digital WS-CRISPR assay has been demonstrated to directly detect SARS-CoV-2 in heat-treated saliva samples without RNA extraction, showing high tolerance to inhibitors. Thus, the digital WS-CRISPR method, as a sensitive and reliable CRISPR assay, facilitates accurate SARS-CoV-2 detection toward digitized quantification.","Ding, X.; Yin, K.; Li, Z.; Sfeir, M.

9095,"Impaired glucose metabolism in patients with diabetes, prediabetes and obesity is associated with severe Covid-19","BackgroundIdentification of risk factors of severe Covid-19 is critical for improving therapies and understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

MethodsWe analyzed 184 patients hospitalized for Covid-19 in Livingston, New Jersey for clinical characteristics associated with severe disease.

ResultsThe majority of Covid-19 patients had diabetes mellitus (DM) (62.0%), Pre-DM (23.9%) with elevated FBG, or a BMI > 30 with normal HbA1C (4.3%). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with new and persistent hyperglycemia in 29 patients, including several with normal HbA1C levels. Forty-four patients required intubation, which occurred significantly more often in patients with DM as compared to non-diabetics.

ConclusionsSevere Covid-19 occurs in the presence of impaired glucose metabolism in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The association of dysregulated glucose metabolism and severe Covid-19 suggests a previously unrecognized manifestation of primary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Exploration of pathways by which SARS-CoV-2 impacts glucose metabolism is critical for understanding disease pathogenesis and developing therapies.","Smith, S.; Boppana, A.; Traupman, J.

20009,Coinfection with Respiratory Pathogens in COVID-19 in Korea,"Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in upper and lower respiratory specimens and coinfection with other respiratory pathogens in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were investigated. From the study subjects (N = 258) retrospectively enrolled when confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive, nasopharyngeal (NPS), oropharyngeal swabs (OPS), and sputum specimens were restored for retesting SARS-CoV-2 and detecting respiratory pathogens. Majority of the study subjects (95.7%, N = 247) were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive using NPS/OPS specimens, suggesting that the upper respiratory specimen is most valuable in detecting SARS-CoV-2. Coinfection rates in COVID-19 patients (N = 258) with respiratory pathogens were 9.7% (N = 25); 8.5% (N = 22) respiratory viruses and 1.2% (N = 3) Mycoplasma pneumoniae, an atypical bacterium. Of the respiratory virus coinfection cases (N = 22), 20 (90.9%) were co-infected with a single respiratory virus and 2 (0.8%) (metapneumovirus/adenovirus and rhinovirus/bocavirus 1/2/3/4) with two viruses. Respiratory viruses in single viral coinfection cases with SARS-CoV-2 were as follows: non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses (229E, NL63, and OC43, N = 5, 1.9%), rhinovirus (N = 4, 1.6%), metapneumovirus (N = 3, 1.2%), influenza A (N = 3, 1.2%), respiratory syncytial virus A and B (N = 3, 1.2%), and adenovirus (N = 2, 0.8%). No mixed coinfections with respiratory viruses and M. pneumoniae were found. In conclusion, the diagnostic value of utilizing NPS/OPS specimen is excellent, and, as the first report in Korea, coinfection with respiratory pathogens were detected at a rate of 9.7% in patients with COVID-19.","Roh, K.

13514,"Inequality indices to monitor geographic differences in incidence, mortality and fatality rates over time during the COVID-19 pandemic.","BackgroundIt is of interest to explore the variability in how the COVID-19 pandemic evolved geographically during the first twelve months. To this end, we apply inequality indices over regions to incidences, infection related mortality, and infection fatality rates. If avoiding of inequality in health is an important political goal, a metric must be implemented to track geographical inequality over time.

MethodsThe relative and absolute Gini index as well as the Theil index are used to quantify inequality. Data are taken from international data bases. Absolute counts are transformed to rates adjusted for population size.

ResultsComparing continents, the absolute Gini index shows an unfavorable development in four continents since February 2020. In contrast, the relative Gini as well as the Theil index support the interpretation of less inequality between European countries compared to other continents. Infection fatality rates within the EU as well as within the U.S. express comparable improvement towards more equality (as measured by both Gini indices).

ConclusionsThe use of inequality indices to monitor changes in geographic in-equality over time for key health indicators is a valuable tool to inform public health policies. The absolute and relative Gini index behave complementary and should be reported simultaneously in order to gain a meta-perspective on very complex dynamics.","Manz, K.; Mansmann, U.",2021-03-25,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.13.20174011,3,Kirsi Manz,Ludwig Maximilians University Munich,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20174011v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20174011v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
15702,Combinations of PCR and isothermal amplification techniques are suitable for fast and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA,"The newly identified coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has affected over 25 million people worldwide as of 31 August 2020. To aid in the development of diagnostic kits for rapid and sensitive detection of the virus, we evaluated a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and isothermal nucleic acid amplification techniques. Here, we compared conventional PCR and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) methods with hybrid techniques such as polymerase chain displacement reaction (PCDR) and a newly developed PCR-LAMP method. We found that the hybrid methods demonstrated higher sensitivity and assay reaction rates than those of the classic LAMP and PCR techniques and can be used to for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The proposed methods based on the modern hybrid amplification techniques markedly improve virus detection and, therefore, can be extremely useful in the development of new diagnostic kits.","Varlamov, D.

5372,"Resident physician exposure to novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV-2) within New York City during exponential phase of COVID-19 pandemic: Report of the New York City Residency Program Directors COVID-19 Research Group","BackgroundFrom March 2-April 12, 2020, New York City (NYC) experienced exponential growth of the COVID-19 pandemic due to novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Little is known regarding how physicians have been affected. We aimed to characterize COVID-19 impact on NYC resident physicians.

MethodsIRB-exempt and expedited cross-sectional analysis through survey to NYC residency program directors (PDs) April 3-12, 2020, encompassing events from March 2-April 12, 2020.

FindingsFrom an estimated 340 residency programs around NYC, recruitment yielded 91 responses, representing 24 specialties and 2,306 residents. 45.1% of programs reported at least one resident with confirmed COVID-19: 101 resident physicians were confirmed COVID-19-positive, with additional 163 residents presumed positive for COVID-19 based on symptoms but awaiting or unable to obtain testing. 56.5% of programs had a resident waiting for, or unable to obtain, COVID-19 testing. Two COVID-19-positive residents were hospitalized, with one in intensive care. Among specialties with >100 residents represented, negative binomial regression indicated that infection risk differed by specialty (p=0.039). Although most programs (80%) reported quarantining a resident, with 16.8% of residents experiencing quarantine, 14.9% of COVID-19-positive residents were not quarantined. 90 programs, encompassing 99.2% of the resident physicians, reported reuse or extended mask use, and 43 programs, encompassing 60.4% of residents, felt that personal protective equipment (PPE) was suboptimal. 65 programs (74.7%) have redeployed residents elsewhere to support COVID-19 efforts.

InterpretationMany resident physicians around NYC have been affected by COVID-19 through direct infection, quarantine, or redeployment. Lack of access to testing and concern regarding suboptimal PPE are common among residency programs. Infection risk may differ by specialty.

13403,Quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from wastewater solids in communities with low COVID-19 incidence and prevalence,"In the absence of an effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19 it is important to be able to track community infections to inform public health interventions aimed at reducing the spread and therefore reduce pressures on health-care units, improve health outcomes and reduce economic uncertainty. Wastewater surveillance has rapidly emerged as a potential tool to effectively monitor community infections for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), through measuring trends of viral RNA signal in wastewater systems. In this study SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA N1 and N2 genes are quantified in solids collected from influent post grit solids (PGS) and primary clarified sludge (PCS) in two water resource recovery facilities (WRRF) serving Canadas national capital region, i.e., the City of Ottawa, ON (pop. {approx} 1.1M) and the City of Gatineau, QC (pop. {approx} 280K). PCS samples show signal inhibition using RT-ddPCR compared to RT-qPCR, with PGS samples showing similar quantifiable concentrations of RNA using both assays. RT-qPCR shows higher frequency of detection of N1 and N2 genes in PCS (92.7, 90.6%) as compared to PGS samples (79.2, 82.3%). Sampling of PCS may therefore be an effective approach for SARS-CoV-2 viral quantification, especially during periods of declining and low COVID-19 incidence in the community. The pepper mild mottle virus (PMMV) is determined to have a less variable RNA signal in PCS over a three month period for two WRRFs, regardless of environmental conditions, compared to Bacteroides 16S rRNA or human eukaryotic 18S rRNA, making PMMV a potentially useful biomarker for normalization of SARS-CoV-2 signal. PMMV-normalized PCS RNA signal from WRRFs of two cities correlated with the regional public health epidemiological metrics, identifying PCS normalized to a fecal indicator (PMMV) as a potentially effective tool for monitoring trends during decreasing and low-incidence of infection of SARS-Cov-2 in communities.","D'aoust, P.

13737,Breastmilk; a source of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA antibodies,"BackgroundSince the outbreak of COVID-19, many put their hopes in the rapid development of effective immunizations. For now patient isolation, physical distancing and good hygiene are the sole measures for prevention. Processed breast milk with antibodies against SaRS-CoV-2 may serve as additional protection. We aimed to determine the presence and neutralization capacity of antibodies against SaRS-CoV-2 in breastmilk of mothers who have recovered from COVID-19.

MethodsThis prospective case control study included lactating mothers, recovered from (suspected) COVID-19 and healthy controls. Serum and breastmilk was collected. To assess the presence of antibodies in breastmilk and serum, we used multiple complementary assays, namely ELISA with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and with the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein for IgG and bridging ELISA with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and N protein for total Ig. To assess the effect of pasteurization breastmilk was exposed to Holder Pasteurization and High Pressure Pasteurization.

ResultsBreastmilk contained antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using any of the assays in 24 out of 29 (83%) proven cases, in six out of nine (67%) suspected cases and in none of the 13 controls. In vitro neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate virus strain was successful in a subset of serum (13%) and milk samples (26%). Although after pasteurization of the milk SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected with both methods of pasteurization, virus neutralizing capacity of those antibodies was only retained with the HPP approach.

ConclusionBreastmilk of mothers who recovered from COVID-19 contains significant amounts of IgA against SARS-CoV-2, both before and after pasteurization.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes breastmilk of mothers who have recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) contain antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)?

FindingsWe provide multiple lines of evidence on the presence of a variety of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with no such antibodies present in the controls. These antibodies are capable of neutralizing a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. We furthermore show that high pressure pasteurization hardly affects antibody levels and efficacy.

18686,"The risk of COVID hospital admission and COVID mortality during the first COVID 19 wave with a special emphasis on Ethnic Minorities: an observational study of a single, deprived, multi ethnic UK health economy","ObjectivesTo address the generalisability of COVID-19s outcomes to the well-defined but diverse communities of a single City area.

DesignAn observational study of COVID-19 outcomes using quality-assured and integrated data from a single UK hospital contextualised to its feeder population and its associated factors (comorbidities, ethnicity, age, deprivation).

Setting/ParticipantsSingle city hospital with a feeder population of 228,632 adults in Wolverhamptons city area.

Main Outcome MeasuresHospital admissions and mortality.

Results5558 patients admitted, 686 died (556 in hospital); 930 were COVID-19 admissions (CA),of which 270 were hospital COVID deaths, 47 non-COVID deaths, 36 deaths post-discharge; 4628 non-COVID-19 admissions (NCA), 239 in-hospital deaths (2 COVID), 94 deaths post-discharge. 223,074 adults not admitted, 407 died. Age, gender, multi-morbidity and Black ethnicity (OR 2.1 [95% CI 1.5-3.2] p<0.001, absolute excess risk of <1/1,000) were associated with COVID-19 admission and mortality. The South Asian cohort had lower CA and NCA, lower mortality (CA (0.5 [0.3-0.8], p<0.01), NCA (0.4 [0.3-0.6] p<0.001), community deaths (0.5 [0.3-0.7] p<0.001). Despite many common risk factors for CA and NCA, ethnic groups had different admission rates, and within-groups differing association of risk factors. Deprivation impacted only in White ethnicity, in the oldest age bracket and in a lesser (not most) deprived quintile.

ConclusionsWolverhamptons results, reflecting high ethnic diversity and deprivation, are similar to other studies for Black ethnicity, age and comorbidity risk in COVID-19 but strikingly different in South Asians and for deprivation. Sequentially considering population and then hospital based NCA and CA outcomes, we present a complete single health-economy picture. Risk factors may differ within ethnic groups; our data may be more representative of communities with high BAME populations, highlighting the need for locally focussed public health strategies. We emphasise the need for a more comprehensible and nuanced conveyance of risk.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThe rapidly developing COVID-19 pandemic has led to numerous studies (published, preprints and national public health reports) of its health impacts in relation to ethnicity, co-morbidities and other factors; few studies, however, have attempted to evaluate infection patient data in terms of morbidity and mortality in context of the feeder population and most are limited by incompleteness of data and inability to account for regional variations in factors such as ethnicity and deprivation
C_LIO_LIOur observational study used a high quality and complete dataset from the local population and the hospital serving it to examine the association of purported risk factors with severity and mortality and the results reveal the importance of evaluating such risks in the local, and not just national, population setting taking into account the local variations in patient backgrounds
C_LIO_LIWe found an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality for Black ethnicity (OR 2.1) but a decreased risk (OR 0.5) for South Asians, compared with white ethnicity; Our analysis reveals that a nuanced approach to studying risk factors associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality is important - factoring in regional variation in ethnicity, deprivation etc. specifically linked to the source population
C_LIO_LIWe suggest, based on our findings, that understandably rapid analysis and dissemination of studies of COVID-19 risk needs to be tempered by careful consideration of the real implications; we further urge caution in conveying risk messages to the wider community because of an ethical imperative to ensure such messages do not lead to unnecessary fear and deter individuals, particularly from specific ethnic backgrounds, from seeking needed medical assistance.

SARS-CoV-2 IgG/A/M antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) were characterized using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and assessed for their ability to neutralize live SARS-CoV-2 virus in recovered subjects who were RT-PCR-positive (n=153), RT-PCR-negative (n=55), and control samples collected pre-COVID-19 (n=520). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 90.9% of resolved subjects up to 180 days post-symptom onset. Anti-S protein and anti-RBD IgG titers correlated (r= 0.5157 and r = 0.6010, respectively) with viral neutralization. Of the RT-PCR-positive subjects, 22 (14.3%) did not have anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; and of those, 17 had RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values >27, raising the possibility that these indeterminate results are from individuals who were not infected, or had mild infection that failed to elicit an antibody response. This study highlights the importance of serological surveys to determine population-level immunity based on infection numbers as determined by RT-PCR.","Huynh, A.; Arnold, D. M.; Smith, J.

17643,"COVID-19, a social disease in Paris: a socio-economic wide association study on hospitalized patients highlights low-income neighbourhood as a key determinant of severe COVID-19 incidence during the first wave of the epidemic","BackgroundStudies have already shown that many environmental factors are associated with COVID-19 incidence. However, none have studied a very large set of socio-economic indicators and analysed to what extent these factors could highlight populations at high risk for COVID-19. We propose here a new approach, a socio-economic wide study, to pinpoint subgroups with a high incidence of COVID-19, and illustrated this approach using hospitalized cases in Paris area.

MethodsWe extracted 303 socio-economic indicators from French census data for the 855 residential units in Paris and assessed their association with COVID-19 hospitalization risk. We then fitted a predictive model using a penalized regression on these indicators to predict the incidence of patient hospitalization for COVID-19 in Paris.

FindingsThe most associated indicator was income, corresponding to the 3rd decile of the population (OR= 0.11, CI95% [0.05; 0.20]). A model including only income achieves a high performance in both the training set (AUC=0.78, CI95%: 0.72-0.85) and the test set (AUC=0.79 (CI95%: 0.71-0.87). Overall, the 45% most deprived areas gathered 86% of the areas with a high incidence of COVID-19 hospitalized cases.

InterpretationDuring the first wave of the epidemic, income predicted Paris areas at risk for a high incidence of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with a high performance. Socio-economic wide association studies, collecting passively data from hospitalized cases, therefore not necessitating any effort for health caregivers, is of particular interest in such a period of hospital overcrowding as it provides real-time indirect information on populations having high COVID-19 incidence.","Jannot, A.-S.; Countouris, H.; Burgun, A.; Katsahian, S.; Rance, B.",2020-11-03,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.10.30.20222901,1,Anne-Sophie Jannot,Universite de Paris,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.20222901v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.20222901v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
23935,Understanding Convergence Between Non-Hispanic Black and White COVID-19 Mortality: A County-Level Approach,"BackgroundNon-Hispanic Black populations have suffered greater per capita COVID-19 mortality at more than 1.5 times that of White populations. Previous work has established that, over time, rates of Black and White mortality have converged; however, some studies suggest that regional shifts in COVID-19 prevalence may play a role in the relative change between racial groups. This studys objective was to investigate changes in Black and White COVID-19 mortality over time and uncover potential mechanisms driving these changes.

Methods and FindingsUsing county-level COVID-19 mortality data stratified by race, we investigate the trajectory of non-Hispanic Black mortality, White mortality, and the Black/White per capita mortality ratio from June 2020-January 2021. Over this period, in the counties studied, cumulative mortality rose by 56.7% and 82.8% for Black and White populations respectively, resulting in a decrease in mortality ratio of 0.369 (23.8%). These trends persisted even when a county-level fixed-effects model was used to estimate changes over time within counties (controlling for all time-invariant county level characteristics and removing the effects of changes in regional distribution of COVID-19). Next, we leverage county-level variation over time in COVID-19 prevalence to show that the decline in the Black/White mortality ratio can be explained by changes in COVID-19 prevalence. Finally, we study heterogeneity in the time trend, finding that convergence occurs most significantly in younger populations, areas with less dense populations, and outside of the Northeast. Limitations include suppressed data in counties with fewer than 10 deaths in a racial category, and the use of provisional COVID-19 death data that may be incomplete.

ConclusionsThe results of this study suggest that convergence in Black/White mortality is not driven by county-level characteristics or changes in the regional dispersion of COVID-19, but instead by changes within counties. Further, declines in the Black/White mortality ratio appear strongly linked to changes in COVID-19 prevalence, rather than a time-specific effect. Further studies on changes in exposure by race over time, or on the vulnerability of individuals who died at different points in the pandemic, may provide crucial insight on mechanisms and strategies to further reduce COVID-19 mortality disparities.","Lawton, R.

18897,Clinical and immunological benefits of convalescent plasma therapy in severe COVID-19: insights from a single center open label randomised control trial,"IntroductionA single center open label phase II randomised control trial was done to assess the pathogen and host-intrinsic factors influencing clinical and immunological benefits of passive immunization using convalescent plasma therapy (CPT), in addition to standard of care (SOC) therapy in severe COVID-19 patients, as compared to patients only on SOC therapy.

MethodsConvalescent plasma was collected from patients recovered from COVID-19 following a screening protocol which also included measuring plasma anti SARS-CoV2 spike IgG content. Retrospectively, neutralizing antibody content was measured and proteome was characterized by LC-MS/MS for all convalescent plasma units that were transfused to patients. Severe COVID-19 patients with evidence for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with PaO2/FiO2 ratio 100-300 (moderate ARDS) were recruited and randomised into two parallel arms of SOC and CPT, N=40 in each arm. Peripheral blood samples were collected on the day of enrolment (T1) followed by day3/4 (T2) and day 7 (T3). RT-PCR and sequencing was done for SARS-CoV2 RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs collected at T1. A panel of cytokines and neutralizing antibody content were measured in plasma at all three timepoints. Patients were followed up for 30 days post-admission to assess the primary outcomes of all cause mortality and immunological correlates for clinical benefits.

ResultsWhile across all age-groups no statistically significant clinical benefit was registered for patients in the CPT arm, significant immediate mitigation of hypoxia, reduction in hospital stay as well as survival benefit was recorded in severe COVID-19 patients with ARDS aged less than 67 years receiving convalescent plasma therapy. In addition to its neutralizing antibody content a prominent effect of convalescent plasma on attenuation of systemic cytokine levels possibly contributed to its benefits.

ConclusionPrecise targeting of severe COVID-19 patients is necessary for reaping the clinical benefits of convalescent plasma therapy.

26815,CovidMulti-Net: A Parallel-Dilated Multi Scale Feature Fusion Architecture for the Identification of COVID-19 Cases from Chest X-ray Images,"The COVID-19 pandemic is an emerging respiratory infectious disease, having a significant impact on the health and life of many people around the world. Therefore, early identification of COVID-19 patients is the fastest way to restrain the spread of the pandemic. However, as the number of cases grows at an alarming pace, most developing countries are now facing a shortage of medical resources and testing kits. Besides, using testing kits to detect COVID-19 cases is a time-consuming, expensive, and cumbersome procedure. Faced with these obstacles, most physicians, researchers, and engineers have advocated for the advancement of computer-aided deep learning models to assist healthcare professionals in quickly and inexpensively recognize COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray (CXR) images. With this motivation, this paper proposes a """"CovidMulti-Net"""" architecture based on the transfer learning concept to classify COVID-19 cases from normal and other pneumonia cases using three publicly available datasets that include 1341, 1341, and 446 CXR images from healthy samples and 902, 1564, and 1193 CXR images infected with Viral Pneumonia, Bacterial Pneumonia, and COVID-19 diseases. In the proposed framework, features from CXR images are extracted using three well-known pre-trained models, including DenseNet-169, ResNet-50, and VGG-19. The extracted features are then fed into a concatenate layer, making a robust hybrid model. The proposed framework achieved a classification accuracy of 99.4%, 95.2%, and 94.8% for 2-Class, 3-Class, and 4-Class datasets, exceeding all the other state-of-the-art models. These results suggest that the """"CovidMulti-Net"""" frameworks ability to discriminate individuals with COVID-19 infection from healthy ones and provides the opportunity to be used as a diagnostic model in clinics and hospitals.

19217,Impact of social distancing regulations and epidemic risk perception on social contact and SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential in rural South Africa: analysis of repeated cross-sectional surveys,"BackgroundSouth Africa implemented rapid and strict physical distancing regulations to minimize SARS-CoV-2 epidemic spread. Evidence on the impact of such measures on interpersonal contact in rural and lower-income settings is limited.

MethodsWe compared population-representative social contact surveys conducted in the same rural KwaZulu-Natal location once in 2019 and twice in mid-2020. Respondents reported characteristics of physical and conversational ( close interaction) contacts over 24 hours. We built age-mixing matrices and estimated the proportional change in the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number (R0). Respondents also reported counts of others present at locations visited and transport used, from which we evaluated change in potential exposure to airborne infection due to shared indoor space ( shared air).

ResultsRespondents in March-December 2019 (n=1704) reported a mean of 7.4 close interaction contacts and 196 shared air person-hours beyond their homes. Respondents in June-July 2020 (n=216), as the epidemic peaked locally, reported 4.1 close interaction contacts and 21 shared air person-hours outside their home, with significant declines in others homes and public spaces. Adults aged over 50 had fewer close contacts with others over 50, but little change in contact with 15-29 year olds, reflecting ongoing contact within multigenerational households. We estimate potential R0 fell by 42% (95% plausible range 14-59%) between 2019 and June-July 2020.

DiscussionExtra-household social contact fell substantially following imposition of Covid-19 distancing regulations in rural South Africa. Ongoing contact within intergenerational households highlighted the limitation of social distancing measures in protecting older adults.

9934,The effectiveness of interventions to reduce COVID-19 transmission in a large urban jail,"ObjectivesTo estimate the impact of various mitigation strategies on COVID-19 transmission in a U.S. jail beyond those offered in national guidelines.

MethodsWe developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in one large urban U.S. jail among staff and incarcerated individuals. We divided the outbreak into four intervention phases: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells, and asymptomatic testing. We used the next generation method to estimate the basic reproduction ratio, R0, in each phase. We estimated the fraction of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by these interventions along with the standard measures of sanitization, masking, and social distancing interventions.

ResultsFor the first outbreak phase, the estimated R0 was 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), and for the subsequent phases, R0,phase 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), R0,phase 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), and R0,phase 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). In total, the jails interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases and hospitalizations and 89% of deaths over 83 days.

ConclusionsDepopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures.

Policy ImplicationsDecision-makers should prioritize reductions in the jail population, single celling, and testing asymptomatic populations, as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.","Malloy, G.

26583,"Distinct immune responses in patients infected with influenza or SARS-CoV-2, and in COVID-19 survivors, characterised by transcriptomic and cellular abundance differences in blood.","BackgroundThe worldwide pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has claimed millions of lives and has had a profound effect on global life. Understanding the pathogenicity of the virus and the bodys response to infection is crucial in improving patient management, prognosis, and therapeutic strategies. To address this, we performed functional transcriptomic profiling to better understand the generic and specific effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsWhole blood RNA sequencing was used to profile a well characterised cohort of patients hospitalised with COVID-19, during the first wave of the pandemic prior to the availability of approved COVID-19 treatments and who went on to survive or die of COVID-19, and patients hospitalised with influenza virus infection between 2017 and 2019. Clinical parameters between patient groups were compared, and several bioinformatic tools were used to assess differences in transcript abundances and cellular composition.

ResultsThe analyses revealed contrasting innate and adaptive immune programmes, with transcripts and cell subsets associated with the innate immune response elevated in patients with influenza, and those involved in the adaptive immune response elevated in patients with COVID-19. Topological analysis identified additional gene signatures that differentiated patients with COVID-19 from patients with influenza, including insulin resistance, mitochondrial oxidative stress and interferon signalling. An efficient adaptive immune response was furthermore associated with patient survival, while an inflammatory response predicted death in patients with COVID-19. A potential prognostic signature was found based on a selection of transcript abundances, associated with circulating immunoglobulins, nucleosome assembly, cytokine production and T cell activation, in the blood transcriptome of COVID-19 patients, upon admission to hospital, which can be used to stratify patients likely to survive or die.

ConclusionsThe results identified distinct immunological signatures between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, prognostic of disease progression and indicative of different targeted therapies. The altered transcript abundances associated with COVID-19 survivors can be used to predict more severe outcomes in patients with COVID-19.","Legebeke, J.; Lord, J.; Penrice-Randal, R.; Vallejo, A.

23093,When thinking you are better leads to feeling worse: Self-other asymmetries in prosocial behavior and increased anxiety during the Covid-19 pandemic,"Thinking one is better than peers is generally associated with positive psychological outcomes like increased self-esteem and resilience. However, this tendency may be problematic in the context of collective action problems, wherein individuals are reliant on others prosocial behaviors to achieve larger goals. We examined this question in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, and recruited participants (n = 1022) from a university community in Spring 2020. We found evidence for a self-peer asymmetry, such that participants reported that they were doing more to stop the spread of the disease and were more prosocially motivated than peers. Actual peer reports indicated that these were overestimations. This self-enhancement tendency comes with a cost: the perceived self-peer asymmetry mediated the relationship between Covid-specific worry and general anxiety during the early lockdown period. This indicates that while believing one is doing more than others may be maladaptive in collective action problems.","Helion, C.; Smith, D.

The proposed SIR model was fitted to confirmed COVID-19 cases from the official press statements to closely reflect the observed epidemic trend in Malaysia. The proposed model is aimed to provide an accurate predictive information for decision makers in assessing the public health and social measures related to COVID-19 epidemic.

MethodsThe SIR model was fitted to the data by minimizing a weighted loss function; the sum of the residual sum of squares (RSS) of infected, removed and total cases. Optimized beta ({beta}),), gamma ({gamma}) parameter values) parameter values and the starting value of susceptible individuals (N) were obtained.

ResultsThe SIR model post-MCO indicates the peak of infection on 10 April 2020, less than 100 active cases by 8 July 2020, less than 10 active cases by 29 August 2020, and close to zero daily new case by 22 July 2020, with a total of 6562 infected cases. In the absence of MCO, the model predicts the peak of infection on 1 May 2020, less than 100 active cases by 14 February 2021, less than 10 active cases by 26 April 2021 and close to zero daily new case by 6 October 2020, with a total of 1.6 million infected cases. Conclusion: The results suggest that the present MCO has significantly reduced the number of susceptible population and the total number of infected cases. The method to fit the SIR model used in this study was found to be accurate in reflecting the observed data. The method can be used to predict the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in other countries.","Arifin, W. N.; Chan, W. H.; Amaran, S.; Musa, K.

3405,Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19 and Impact on Public Health Policy,"In this work we construct a mathematical model for the transmission and spread of coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19. Our model features delay terms to account for (a) the time lapse or latency period between contracting the disease and displaying symptoms, and (b) the time lag in testing patients for the virus due to the limited numbers of testing facilities currently available. We find that the delay introduces a significant disparity between the actual and reported time-trajectories of cases in a particular region. Specifically, the reported case histories lag the actual histories by a few days. Hence, to minimize the spread of the disease, lockdowns and similarly drastic social isolation measures need to be imposed some time before the reported figures are approaching their peak values. We then account for the social reality that lockdowns can only be of a limited duration in view of practical considerations. We find that the most effective interval for imposing such a limited-time lockdown is one where the midpoint of the lockdown period coincides with the actual peak of the spread of the disease in the absence of the lockdown. We further show that the true effectivity of imposing a lockdown may be misrepresented and grossly underestimated by the reported case trajectories in the days following the action.","Shayak, B.; Sharma, M.

3491,Reporting the life tracks of confirmed cases can effective prevent and control the COVID-19 outbreak in China,"BackgroundSince late December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has emerged in Wuhan and rapidly spread throughout China. Fears were raised higher, effective policies for prevention and control were concerned.

MethodsTill March 3, 91273 confirmed COVID-19 cases were included in. Using Mann-Whitney U test, the provinces that reported the life tracks of confirmed cases to public had lower increased in daily new confirmed cases.

ResultsCompared with the paired province, Tianjin, Jilin, Gansu, Shanxi, Hainan and Guizhou had significant differences in the number of new confirmed cases and have lower mean rank (P<0.05). Shanghai had a lower mean rank (P=0.175) but no significant difference. Besides, the successful prevention and control work need other effective strategies, such as real time media coverage, isolating the suspected cases or close contacts, delaying the return of work, closing schools, wearing facial masks, and disinfecting the communities, et.al.

ConclusionsStrategies must be adjusted in real time according to the epidemic. Reporting the life tracks of confirmed cases was an effective way to control the epidemic.

12716,High rate of major drug-drug interactions of lopinavir-ritonavir for COVID-19 treatment,"The impact of drug-drug interactions (DDI) between ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV-r) to treat patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and commonly used drugs in clinical practice is not well-known. Thus, we evaluated the rate and severity of DDI between LPV-r for COVID-19 treatment and concomitant medications. This was a cross-sectional study including all individuals diagnosed of SARS-CoV-2 infection treated with LPV-r and attended at a single center in Southern Spain (March 1st to April 30th, 2020). The frequency [95% confidence interval (95% CI)] of potential and major DDI were calculated. Overall, 469 patients were diagnosed of COVID-19, 125 (27%) of them were prescribed LPV-r. LPV-r had potential DDI with concomitant medications in 97 (78%, 95% CI: 69%-85%) patients, and in 33 (26%, 95% CI: 19%-35%) individuals showed major DDI. Twelve (36%) patients with major DDI and 14 (15%) individuals without major DDI died (p=0.010). After adjustment, only the Charlson index was independently associated with death [adjusted OR (95% CI) for Charlson index [&ge;]5: 85 (10-731), p <0.001]. LPV-r was discontinued due to side effects in 31 (25%) patients. Management by the Infectious Diseases Unit was associated with a lower likelihood of major DDI [adjusted odds ratio (95% CI): 0.14 (0.04-0.53), p=0.003). In conclusion, a high frequency of DDI between LPV-r for treating COVID-19 and concomitant medications was found, including major DDI. Patients with major DDI showed worse outcomes, but this association was explained by the older age and comorbidities. Patients managed by the Infectious Diseases Unit had lower risk of major DDI.","Macias, J.; Pinilla, A.; Lao-Dominguez, F.

7965,"Evaluation of ELISA tests for the qualitative determination of IgG, IgM and IgA to SARS-CoV-2","Serological assays for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are now of critical importance to support diagnosis, guide epidemiological intervention, and understand immune response to natural infection and vaccine administration. We developed and validated new anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and IgA ELISA tests (ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 ELISA, DIESSE Diagnostica Senese S.p.a.) based on whole-virus antigens. We used a total of 553 serum samples including samples from COVID-19 suspected and confirmed cases, healthy donors, and patients positive for other infections or autoimmune conditions. Overall, the assays showed good concordance with the indirect immunofluorescence reference test in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Especially for IgG and IgA, we observed high sensitivity (92.5 and 93.6%, respectively); specificity was high (>96%) for all antibody types ELISAs. In addition, sensitivity was linked to the days from symptoms onset (DSO) due to the seroconversion window, and for ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA ELISAs resulted 100% in those samples collected after 10 and 12 DSO, respectively. The results showed that ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 ELISAs may represent a valid option for both diagnostic and epidemiological purposes, covering all different antibody types developed in SARS-CoV-2 immune response.","Colavita, F.; Brogi, A.; Lapa, D.; Bordi, L.; Matusali, G.; Meschi, S.; Marsella, P.; Tesi, G.; Bandini, T.; Di Caro, A.; Capobianchi, M.

25664,Impact of vaccination on new SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United Kingdom,"ObjectivesTo assess the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community.

DesignProspective cohort study.

SettingThe UK population-representative longitudinal COVID-19 Infection Survey.

Participants373,402 participants aged [&ge;]16 years contributing 1,610,562 RT-PCR results from nose and throat swabs between 1 December 2020 and 3 April 2021.

Main outcome measuresNew RT-PCR-positive episodes for SARS-CoV-2 overall, by self-reported symptoms, by cycle threshold (Ct) value (<30 versus [&ge;]30), and by gene positivity (compatible with the B.1.1.7 variant versus not).

ResultsOdds of new SARS-CoV-2 infection were reduced 65% (95% CI 60 to 70%; P<0.001) in those [&ge;]21 days since first vaccination with no second dose versus unvaccinated individuals without evidence of prior infection (RT-PCR or antibody). In those vaccinated, the largest reduction in odds was seen post second dose (70%, 95% CI 62 to 77%; P<0.001).There was no evidence that these benefits varied between Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines (P>0.9).There was no evidence of a difference in odds of new SARS-CoV-2 infection for individuals having received two vaccine doses and with evidence of prior infection but not vaccinated (P=0.89). Vaccination had a greater impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections with evidence of high viral shedding Ct<30 (88% reduction after two doses; 95% CI 80 to 93%; P<0.001) and with self-reported symptoms (90% reduction after two doses; 95% CI 82 to 94%; P<0.001); effects were similar for different gene positivity patterns.

ConclusionVaccination with a single dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, or two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, significantly reduced new SARS-CoV-2 infections in this large community surveillance study. Greater reductions in symptomatic infections and/or infections with a higher viral burden are reflected in reduced rates of hospitalisations/deaths, but highlight the potential for limited ongoing transmission from asymptomatic infections in vaccinated individuals.

27942,School teachers' self-reported fear and risk perception during the COVID-19 pandemic - a nationwide survey in Germany,"BackgroundWith COVID-19 cases peaking, COVID-19 vaccination programs starting and health systems reaching their limits in winter 2020/21, schools remained closed in many countries despite ever-recurring debates. To better understand teachers fear of infection and risk perception we conducted a survey in Germany.

MethodsParticipants were recruited through various associations and invited to take part in a cross-sectional COVID-19 specific online survey. Anonymous demographic and self-reported data were collected from those who gave their informed consent. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed. To evaluate with fear associated factors of contracting SARS-CoV-2, an adjusted multivariable regression analysis was performed.

Results6.753 teachers gave their informed consent to answer the online survey. The median age of the teachers was 43 years with 77% being female. Most teachers worked in high schools (29%) and elementary schools (26%). Most participants (73%) feared to contract SARS-CoV-2 at school while 77% intended to be vaccinated against COVID-19. 98% considered students to pose the greatest risk. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that female and younger teachers were significantly more anxious to get infected with SARS-CoV-2 and that the odds teachers were more anxious was 9 times higher for those who favored re-opening of schools the least (p < 0.001).

ConclusionsTo the authors knowledge, this is the first study to describe teachers fear and risk perception of COVID-19 and their attitude towards vaccinations in a nationwide survey. The anxiety correlates to the COVID-19 protection measures demanded. Teachers fear is the driving factor and not a rational logic.","Weinert, S.; Thronicke, A.; Hinse, M.; Schad, F.; Matthes, H.",2021-06-21,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.06.17.21258956,1,Stefanie Weinert,Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.17.21258956v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.17.21258956v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
25904,COVID-19 vaccine willingness and cannabis use histories,"BackgroundCannabis use is associated with problematic health-behaviors such as excessive alcohol and tobacco use, and sedentary behavior. Here, we examined the association between cannabis use history and an especially topical health-behavior, willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

MethodsCOVID-19 vaccine willingness was surveyed in a subset of participants from the Tulsa 1000 Study, which is a longitudinal study of psychiatric treatment-seeking and healthy control participants. We identified 45 participants who completed a COVID-19 vaccine questionnaire and reported more than 10 lifetime cannabis uses. Those participants were compared to a group of 45 individuals with very light (<10) cannabis use histories who were propensity score-matched on age, sex, income, and race. Two-group t-tests and Bayes factor analysis on vaccine willingness were conducted between groups. Exploratory correlation analyses were conducted on vaccine willingness and lifetime cannabis use levels within the cannabis group only.

ResultsVaccine willingness did not differ between the two groups (t88=0.33, p=.74; BF01=4.3). However, a negative correlation was identified within the cannabis group, such that higher lifetime cannabis use histories correlated with less willingness to receive a vaccine (rho43= -.33, p=.03).

ConclusionsAlthough vaccine willingness did not differ between the two matched groups, preliminary evidence suggests that heavy lifetime cannabis use might indicate a reluctance to engage in health-promoting behaviors like receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.","Spechler, P.

22355,Community end-of-life care during the COVID-19 pandemic: Initial findings of a UK primary care survey,"BackgroundThousands of people in the UK have required end-of-life care in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary healthcare teams (general practice and community nursing services) have provided the majority of this care, alongside specialist colleagues. There is a need to learn from this experience in order to inform future service delivery and planning.

AimTo understand the views of general practitioners and community nurses providing end-of-life care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Design and SettingA web-based, UK-wide questionnaire survey circulated via professional general practice and community nursing networks during September and October 2020.

MethodResponses were analysed using descriptive statistics and an inductive thematic analysis.

ResultsValid responses were received from 559 individuals (387 community nurses, 156 General Practitioners (GPs) and 16 unspecified role), from all regions of the UK. The majority reported increased involvement in providing community end-of-life care. Contrasting and potentially conflicting roles emerged between GPs and community nurses. There was increased use of remote consultations, particularly by GPs. Community nurses took greater responsibility in most aspects of end-of-life care practice, particularly face-to-face care, but reported feeling isolated. For some GPs and community nurses, there has been considerable emotional distress.

ConclusionPrimary healthcare services are playing a critical role in meeting increased need for end-of-life care in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have adapted rapidly, but the significant emotional impact, especially for community nurses, needs addressing alongside rebuilding trusting and supportive team dynamics.

How this fits in (4 sentences)O_LIThis study provides insights into experiences of delivering end-of-life care in the community during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspectives of UK general practitioners (GPs) and community nurses.
C_LIO_LIServices have changed and adapted rapidly to meet increased need in terms of both volume and complexity, with community nurses taking greater responsibility for most areas of palliative care clinical practice, and GPs undertaking more care planning conversations.
C_LIO_LIWhile GPs and specialist palliative care services conducted more remote consultations, community nurses carried out face-to-face end-of-life care and reported a feeling of isolation.
C_LIO_LIAs the pandemic progresses, and the increased need for end-of-life care in the community persists, more effective service models and multi-disciplinary teamwork in primary care are urgently needed.

9567,Low rate of daily smokers in patients with symptomatic COVID-19,"BackgroundIdentification of prognostic factors in COVID-19 remains a global challenge. The role of smoking is still controversial.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the rate of daily smokers in patients with COVID-19.

MethodsCOVID-19 in-and outpatients from a large French university hospital were systematically interviewed for their smoking status, use of e-cigarette and nicotinic substitutes. The rates of daily smokers in in-and outpatients were compared to those in the 2019 French general population, after standardization for sex and age.

ResultsThe inpatient group was composed of 340 patients, median age 66 years: 203 men (59.7%) and 137 women (40.3%), median age for both 66 years, with a daily smokers rate of 4.1 % CI95% [2.3-6.9] (5.4% of men, 2.2% of women). The outpatient group was composed of 139 patients, median age 44 years: 62 men (44.6%, median age 43 years), and 77 women (55.4%, median age 44 years). The daily smoker rate was 6.1 % CI 95% [2.7 - 11.6] (5.1% of men, 6.8% of women). In the 2019 French population, the daily smoker rate was 24.0% (27.5% of men, 20.7% of women). Among inpatients, daily smokers represented 2.2% and 3.4% of the 45 dead patients and of the 29 patients transferred to ICU, respectively.

The rate of daily smokers was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients, as compared to that in the French general population after standardization by age and sex, with Standardized Incidence Ratios of 0.24 [0.12-0.48] for outpatients and 0.24 [0.14-0.40] for inpatients.

19166,International observational survey of the effectiveness of personal protective equipment during endoscopic procedures performed in patients with COVID-19,"Introduction and aimsThis international survey was performed to evaluate the cumulative incidence of nosocomial novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among healthcare professionals during endoscopic procedures.

MethodsWe performed an international web-based self-reported questionnaire survey. Participants completed the questionnaires every week for 12 weeks. The questionnaire elicited responses regarding the development of COVID-19 and details of the PPE used.

ResultsAll 483 participants were included in the analysis. Participants had a mean age of 42.3 years and comprised 68.3% males. The geographic distribution of the study population was Asia (89.2%), Europe (2.9%), North and South America (4.8%), Oceania (0.6%), and Africa (1.5%). The most common endoscopy-related role of the participants was endoscopist (78.7%), and 74.5% had > 10 years of experience. Fourteen participants had performed 83 endoscopic procedures in patients positive for COVID-19. During the mean follow-up period of 4.95 weeks, there were no cases of COVID-19 when treating COVID-19 positive patients. The most common PPE used by participants treating patients with COVID-19 was a surgical mask plus N95 mask plus face shield, goggles, cap, long-sleeved isolation gown, and single pair of gloves. The most common PPE used by participants treating patients without COVID-19 was a surgical mask, no face shield but goggles, cap, long-sleeved isolation gown, and single pair of gloves during all endoscopic procedures.

ConclusionsThe risk of COVID-19 transmission during any endoscopic procedure was low in clinical practice.","Niikura, R.; Fujishiro, M.; Nakai, Y.; Matsuda, K.; Kawahara, T.; Yamada, A.; Tsuji, Y.; Hayakawa, Y.; Koike, K.",2020-12-02,Gastroenterology,10.1101/2020.12.01.20240853,1,Yousuke Nakai,"Department of Gastroenterology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.01.20240853v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.01.20240853v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1159/000513714

Evidence on the experience of those receiving or providing maternity care is important to guide practice through this challenging time.

MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in Australia. Five key stakeholder cohorts were included to explore and compare the experiences of those receiving or providing care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women, their partners, midwives, medical practitioners and midwifery students who had received or provided maternity care from March 2020 onwards in Australia were invited to participate in an online survey. which was released between 13th May and 24th June 2020; a total of 3701 completed responses were received.

FindingsWhile anxiety related to COVID-19 was high among all five cohorts, there were statistically significant differences between the responses from each cohort for most survey items. Women were more likely to indicate concern about their own and familys health and safety in relation to COVID-19 whereas midwives, doctors and midwifery students were more likely to be concerned about occupational exposure to COVID-19 through working in a health setting than those receiving care through attending these environments. Midwifery students and womens partners were more likely to respond that they felt isolated because of the changes to the way care was provided. Despite concerns about care received or provided not meeting expectations, most respondents were satisfied with the quality of care provided, although midwives and midwifery students were less likely to agree.

ConclusionThis paper provides a unique exploration and comparison of experiences of receiving and providing maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Findings are useful to support further service changes and future service redesign. New evidence provided offers unique insight into key stakeholders experiences of the rapid changes to health services.","Bradfield, Z.; Wynter, K.; Hauck, Y.; Vasilevski, V.; Kuliukas, L.; Wilson, A.; Szabo, R.

2572,Impact of self-imposed prevention measures and short-term government-imposed social distancing on mitigating and delaying a COVID-19 epidemic: A modelling study,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread to nearly every country in the world since it first emerged in China in December 2019. Many countries have implemented social distancing as a measure to  flatten the curve of the ongoing epidemics. Evaluation of the impact of government-imposed social distancing and of other measures to control further spread of COVID-19 is urgent, especially because of the large societal and economic impact of the former. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of self-imposed prevention measures and of short-term government-imposed social distancing in mitigating, delaying, or preventing a COVID-19 epidemic.

Methods and FindingsWe developed a deterministic compartmental transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 in a population stratified by disease status (susceptible, exposed, infectious with mild or severe disease, diagnosed and recovered) and disease awareness status (aware and unaware) due to the spread of COVID-19. Self-imposed measures were assumed to be taken by disease-aware individuals and included handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing. Government-imposed social distancing reduced the contact rate of individuals irrespective of their disease or awareness status. The model was parameterized using current best estimates of key epidemiological parameters from COVID-19 clinical studies. The model outcomes included the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate, and time until the peak number of diagnoses. For fast awareness spread in the population, selfimposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. A large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. Early implementation of short-term government-imposed social distancing can only delay the peak (by at most 7 months for a 3-month intervention). The delay can be even longer and the height of the peak can be additionally reduced if this intervention is combined with self-imposed measures that are continued after government-imposed social distancing has been lifted. Our analyses do not account for stochasticity, demographics, heterogeneities in contact patterns or mixing, spatial effects, imperfect isolation of individuals with severe disease, and reinfection with COVID-19.

ConclusionsOur results suggest that information dissemination about COVID-19, which causes individual adaption of handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing can be an effective strategy to mitigate and delay the epidemic. Early-initiated short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing COVID-19 burden. We stress the importance of disease awareness in controlling the ongoing epidemic and recommend that, in addition to policies on social distancing, governments and public health institutions mobilize people to adopt self-imposed measures with proven efficacy in order to successfully tackle COVID-19.

12255,Estimating Variation of Covid-19 infection in the Population:Results from Understanding Society (UKHLS) first monthly covid-19 survey,"The analysis in this paper uses the new Understanding Society COVID-19 survey. The key advantage of these data is that they allow us to examine infection rates for people with particular characteristics. We study how reported symptoms vary in the population and relate reported symptoms to a positive Covid-19 test in the small sample in the survey who were tested. Combining these probabilities we find that the chances of infection increase with a persons education level, are lower and declining with age among those aged over 55, and were higher in the West Midlands and London and lower in the North East than in the rest of the country, and tended to increase with regional population density. There is also evidence that the infection rate was lower among those of a Caribbean origin. A suitably cautious estimate of the mean infection rate is that, during the period up to the end of April 2020, it was between 2% and 8%, with a central rate of about 5%.","Breen, R.; Ermisch, J.",2020-07-25,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.22.20159806,1,John Ermisch,University of Oxford,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159806v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159806v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
14394,Suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan,"The prolonged uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, fear and anxiety regarding infections, precautionary social isolation, and the resulting economic disruption could deteriorate psychological health and exacerbate the suicidal risk. Utilizing month-level suicide records covering the entire Japanese population (126 million) in 1,861 administrative units, we assessed if suicide mortality changed during the pandemic. We employed difference-in-difference estimation and found that overall suicide rate declined by 13.5% (95% CI: -17.5% to -9.5%) after the outbreak and the subsequent measures (school closure and the state of emergency). The decline is larger among males than females and among adults than children and older adults. The governments generous subsidies, reduced working hours, and fewer school sessions potentially account for its sizable decline.","Tanaka, T.; Okamoto, S.",2020-12-22,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.08.30.20184168,4,Shohei Okamoto,Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.30.20184168v4?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.30.20184168v4.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1038/s41562-020-01042-z
23570,SARS-COV-2 antibody prevalence in patients on dialysis in the US in January 2021,"BackgroundTo estimate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the US, the country with the worlds largest absolute numbers of COVID19 cases and deaths, we conducted a cross-sectional assessment from a sample of patients receiving dialysis in January 2021.

MethodsWe tested remainder plasma of 21,424 patients receiving dialysis through the third-largest US dialysis organization, with facilities located nationwide. We used the Siemens spike protein receptor binding domain total antibody assay to estimate crude SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, and then estimated seroprevalence for the US dialysis and adult population by standardizing by age, sex and region. We also compared January 2021 seroprevalence and case-detection rates to that from a similar subsample of patients receiving dialysis who had been tested in July 2020.

ResultsPatients in the sample were disproportionately from older age and minority race/ethnic groups. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 18.9% (95% CI: 18.3-19.5%) in the sample, 18.7% (18.1-19.2%) standardized to the US dialysis population, and 21.3% (20.3-22.3%) standardized to the US adult population (range 15.3-20.8% in the Northeast and South respectively). Younger age groups (18-44 years), and persons self-identifying as Hispanic or living in Hispanic neighborhoods, and persons living in the poorest neighborhoods were among the subgroups with the highest seroprevalence (25.9% (24.1-27.8%), 25.1% (23.6-26.4%), 24.8% (23.2-26.5%) respectively). Compared to data from July 2020, we observed diminished variability in seroprevalence by geographic region and urban-rural status. Estimated case detection rate increased from 14% to 23% in July 2020 to January 2021.

ConclusionsA year after the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in the US, fewer than one in four adults have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Vaccine roll out to majority minority neighborhoods and poorer neighborhoods will be critical to disrupting the spread of infection.

Here, we developed a blood test to broadly quantify cell, tissue, and organ specific injury due to COVID-19, using genome-wide methylation profiling of circulating cell-free DNA in plasma. We assessed the utility of this test to identify subjects with severe disease in two independent, longitudinal cohorts of hospitalized patients. Cell-free DNA profiling was performed on 104 plasma samples from 33 COVID-19 patients and compared to samples from patients with other viral infections and healthy controls. We found evidence of injury to the lung and liver and involvement of red blood cell progenitors associated with severe COVID-19. The concentration of cfDNA correlated with the WHO ordinal scale for disease progression and was significantly increased in patients requiring intubation.

28105,"Into the thirteenth Month: A Case Study on the Outbreak Analytics and Modeling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Pune City, India","With more than 140 million people infected globally and 3 million deaths, the COVID 19 pandemic has left a lasting impact. A modern response to a pandemic of such proportions needs to focus on exploiting all available data to inform the response in real-time and allow evidence-based decision-making. The intermittent lockdowns in the last 13 months have created economic adversity to prevent anticipated large-scale mortality and relax the lockdowns have been an attempt at recovering and balancing economic needs and public health realities. This article is a comprehensive case study of the outbreak in the city limits of Pune, Maharashtra, India, to understand the evolution of the disease and transmission dynamics starting from the first case on March 9, 2020. A unique collaborative effort between the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), a government entity, and the Pune knowledge Cluster (PKC) allowed us to layout a context for outbreak response and intervention. We report here how access to granular data for a metropolitan city with pockets of very high-density populations will help analyze, in real-time, the dynamics of the pandemic and forecasts for better management and control of SARS-CoV-2. Outbreak data analytics resulted in a real-time data visualization dashboard for accurate information dissemination for public access on the epidemics progress. As government agencies craft testing and vaccination policies and implement intervention strategies to mitigate a second wave, our case study underscores the criticality of data quality and analytics to decode community transmission of COVID-19.","Monteiro, J.; Pujari, B.; Maitra Bhattacharrya, S.; Raghunathan, A.; Keskar, A.; Shaikh, A.; Bogam, P.; Kadu, S.; Raut, N.; Vavale, D.; Mishra, R.; Kembhavi, A.; Shashidhara, L.

28096,Association between SARS-Cov-2 infection during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes: a re-analysis of data from Wei et al. (2021).,"BackgroundWei et al. have published a meta-analysis (MA) which aimed to """"evaluate the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes"""".

Using classical random-effects model, they found that SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with preeclampsia, preterm birth and stillbirth.

Performing MA with low event rates or with few studies may be challenging as MA relies on several within and between study distributional assumptions.

Methodsto assess the robustness of the results provided by Wei et al., we performed a sensitivity analysis using several frequentist and Bayesian meta-analysis methods. We also estimated fragility indexes.

ResultsFor eclampsia (patients with Covid-19 vs without), the confidence intervals of most frequentist models contain 1. All beta-binomial models (Bayesian) lead to credible intervals containing 1. The prediction interval, based on DL method ranges from 0.75 to 2.38. The fragility index is 2 for the DL method.

For preterm, the confidence (credible) intervals exclude 1. The prediction interval is broad, ranging from 0.84 to 20.61. The fragility index ranges from 27 to 10.

For stillbirth, the confidence intervals of most frequentist models contain 1. Six Bayesian MA models lead to credible intervals containing 1.The prediction interval ranges from 0.52 to 8.49. The fragility index is 3.

InterpretationGiven the available data and the results of our broad sensitivity analysis, we can only suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is associated to preterm, and may be associated to preeclampsia. For stillbirth, more data are needed as none of the Bayesian analyses are conclusive.","Ludwig Serge, A.

1616,Distinguishing Viruses Responsible for Influenza-Like Illness,"The many respiratory viruses that cause influenza-like illness (ILI) are reported and tracked as one entity, defined by the CDC as a group of symptoms that include a fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit and a cough and/or a sore throat. In the United States alone, ILI impacts 9-49 million people every year. While tracking ILI as a single clinical syndrome is informative in many respects, the underlying viruses differ in their parameters and outbreak properties. Most existing models treat either a single respiratory virus or ILI as a whole. However, there is a need for models capable of comparing several individual ILI viruses. To address this need, here we present a flexible model and simulations of epidemics for influenza, RSV, rhinovirus, seasonal coronavirus, adenovirus, and SARS/MERS, parameterized by a systematic literature review and accompanied by a global sensitivity analysis. We find that for these biological causes of ILI, their parameter values, timing, prevalence, and proportional contributions differ substantially. These results demonstrate that distinguishing the viruses that cause influenza-like illness will be an important aspect of future work on ILI diagnostics, mitigation, modeling, and preparation for future unknown pandemics.","Spencer, J.; Shutt, D.

23378,Prevalence of vitamin D is not associated with the COVID-19 epidemic in Europe. A critical update of the existing evidence.,"BackgroundCOVID-19 has emerged as a global pandemic, affecting nearly 104 million people worldwide as of February 4th 2021. In previous published studies, the association between the mean Vit D status of each country and COVID-19 infection rate, and mortality among the adult population in European countries was examined. The aim of this study was to re-examine the relationship between the Vit D status of each country and COVID-19 infection, recovery, and mortality using updated data and a different methodological approach.

MethodsInformation only form the last decade on Vit D concentration/deficiency for each country was retrieved through literature search on PubMed(R) database. As of February, 4th 2021, COVID-19 infections and mortalities per one million population as well as total recoveries were extracted from the Worldometer website. The association between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 infection, recovery, and mortality were explored using correlation coefficients and scatterplots.

FindingsThe prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among European countries ranged from 6.0 (Finland) to 75.5% (Turkey), with several countries facing more than 50% of vitamin D deficiency among their population. Non-significant correlations were observed between the number of COVID-19 infections (r=0.190; p=0.374), recoveries (rs=0.317, p=0.131), and mortalities (r=0.129; p=0.549) per one million population, with the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.

InterpretationPrevalence of vitamin D deficiency was not significantly associated with either number of infections, recoveries or mortality rate of COVID-19 among European countries. Thus, it is an important parameter to be considered when implementing preventive measures to face COVID-19.

18553,"Climatic and socio-economic factors supporting the co-circulation of dengue, Zika and chikungunya in three different ecosystems in Colombia","Dengue, Zika and chikungunya are diseases of global health significance caused by arboviruses and transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti of worldwide circulation. The arrival of the Zika and chikungunya viruses to South America increased the complexity of transmission and morbidity caused by these viruses co-circulating in the same vector mosquito species. Here we present an integrated analysis of the reported arbovirus cases between 2007 and 2017 and local climate and socio-economic profiles of three distinct Colombian municipalities (Bello, Cucuta and Moniquira). These locations were confirmed as three different ecosystems given their contrasted geographic, climatic and socio-economic profiles. Correlational analyses were conducted with both generalised linear models and generalised additive models for the geographical data. Average temperature and wind speed were strongly correlated with disease incidence. The transmission of Zika during the 2016 epidemic appeared to decrease circulation of dengue in Cucuta, an area of sustained high incidence of dengue. Socio-economic factors such as barriers to health and childhood services, inadequate sanitation and poor water supply suggested an unfavourable impact on the transmission of dengue, Zika and chikungunya in all three ecosystems. Socio-demographic influencers were also discussed including the influx of people to Cucuta, fleeing political and economic instability from neighbouring Venezuela. Aedes aegypti is expanding its range and increasing the global threat of these diseases. It is therefore vital that we learn from the epidemiology of these arboviruses and translate it into an actionable knowledge base. This is even more acute given the recent historical high of dengue cases in the Americas in 2019, preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, which is itself hampering mosquito control efforts.

Author summaryViruses transmitted by Ae. aegypti mosquitoes (dengue, Zika, chikungunya) are amongst the most significant public health concerns of recent years due to the increase in global cases and the rapid spread of the vectors. The primary method of controlling the spread of these arboviruses is through mosquito control. Understanding factors associated with risk of these viruses is key for informing control programmes and predicting when outbreaks may occur. Climate is an important driver in mosquito development and virus reproduction and hence the association of climate with disease risk. Socio-economic factors contribute to perpetuate disease risk. Areas of high poverty have abundance of suitable habitat for Ae. aegypti (e.g. due to poor housing and sanitation). This study investigated the factors effecting arbovirus incidence in three distinct regions of Colombia: Bello, Cucuta and Moniquira. The results show significant relationships between disease incidence and temperature, precipitation and wind speed. A decline in dengue following outbreaks of Zika (2016) is also reported. Measures of poverty, including critical overcrowding and no access to improved water source were also found to be higher in areas of higher disease incidence. The results of this study highlight the importance of using a multifactorial approach when designing vector control programs in order to effectively distribute health care resources.","Morgan, J.; Strode, C.; Salcedo-Sora, J.

9432,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on lung cancer treatment scheduling,"ObjectiveCurrent pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a heavy burden on the mental and physical health of patients, regional healthcare resources, and global economic activity. Many patients with lung cancer are thought to be affected by this situation. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on lung cancer treatment scheduling.

Study designWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records of lung cancer patients who were undergoing anti-cancer treatment at the National Hospital Organization Kyoto Medical Center (600 beds) in Kyoto, Japan, between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020.

MethodsAfter the medical records were reviewed, the patients were assigned to one of two groups, depending on whether their lung cancer treatment schedule was delayed. We assessed the characteristics, types of histopathology and treatment, and the reason for the delay.

ResultsA total 15 (9.1%) patients experienced the delay of lung cancer treatment during COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with treatment delay received significantly more ICIs monotherapy than patients without treatment delay (p=0.0057). On the contrary, no patients receiving molecular target agents experienced treatment delay during COVID-19 pandemic period (p=0.0027). The treatments of most of the patients were delayed per their request.

ConclusionWe revealed 9.1% lung cancer patients suffered anxiety and requested treatment delay during COVID-19 pandemic.

The country was put under lockdown from 25 March 2020. The present study is aimed at providing a simple algebraic analysis of the trend that is evident in the spread of the disease in this part of the world. The purpose of this algebraic approach is to simplify the calculation sufficiently by deviating from the standard techniques that are conventionally used to construct mathematical models of epidemics. The predictions, obtained from this algebraic study, are found to be in reasonable agreement with the recorded data. Using this mathematical formulation we have determined the time variation of the number of asymptomatic patients, who are believed to play a major role in spreading the disease. We have discussed the effect of lockdown in reducing the rate of transmission of the disease. On the basis of the proposed models, predictions have been made regarding the possible trend of the rise in the number of cases beyond the withdrawal of lockdown. All these things have been calculated by using very simple mathematical expressions which can be easily understood and used by those who have a rudimentary knowledge of algebra.","Roy, S.",2020-05-14,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.10.20097691,1,Sudipto Roy,"St. Xavier\'s College, Kolkata, West Bengal, India",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.10.20097691v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.10.20097691v1.full.pdf,cc_by,"NA"
19634,"Risk factors for retirement home COVID-19 outbreaks in Ontario, Canada: A population-level cohort study","BackgroundThe epidemiology of COVID-19 in retirement homes (also known as assisted living facilities) is largely unknown. We examined the association between retirement home and community level characteristics and the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks in retirement homes during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic.

MethodsWe conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of licensed retirement homes in Ontario, Canada, from March 1st - September 24th, 2020. Our primary outcome was a COVID-19 outbreak ([&ge;]1 resident or staff confirmed case by validated nucleic acid amplification assay). We used time-dependent proportional hazards methods to model the associations between retirement home and community level characteristics and COVID-19 outbreaks.

ResultsOur cohort included all 770 licensed retirement homes in Ontario, which housed 56,491 residents. There were 172 (22.3%) COVID-19 retirement home outbreaks involving 1,045 (1.9%) residents and 548 staff (1.5%). COVID-19 cases were distributed unevenly across retirement homes, with 1,593 (92.2%) resident and staff cases occurring in 77 (10%) of homes. The adjusted hazard of a COVID-19 outbreak in a retirement home was positively associated with homes that had a large resident capacity, homes that were co-located with a long-term care facility, large corporate owned chains, homes that offered many services onsite, increases in regional COVID-19 incidence, and a higher community-level ethnic concentration.

InterpretationReadily identifiable retirement home-level characteristics are independently associated with COVID-19 outbreaks and may support risk identification. A higher ethnic concentration of the community surrounding a retirement home is associated COVID-19 outbreaks, with an uncertain mechanism.","Costa, A. P.; Manis, D. R.; Jones, A.; Stall, N.

We developed How We Feel, an extensible web and mobile application that aggregates self-reported survey responses, to fill gaps in the collection of COVID-19-related data. How We Feel collects longitudinal and geographically localized information on users health, behavior, and demographics. Here we report results from over 500,000 users in the United States from April 2, 2020 to May 12, 2020. We show that self-reported surveys can be used to build predictive models of COVID-19 test results, which may aid in identification of likely COVID-19 positive individuals. We find evidence among our users for asymptomatic or presymptomatic presentation, as well as for household and community exposure, occupation, and demographics being strong risk factors for COVID-19. We further reveal factors for which users have been SARS-CoV-2 PCR tested, as well as the temporal dynamics of self-reported symptoms and self-isolation behavior in positive and negative users. These results highlight the utility of collecting a diverse set of symptomatic, demographic, and behavioral self-reported data to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.","Allen, W.

6612,Myocardial characteristics as the prognosis for COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundAmid the crisis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), front-line clinicians in collaboration with backstage medical researchers analyzed clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients and reported the prognosis using myocardial data records upon hospitalization.

MethodsWe reported 135 cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted in The First Peoples Hospital of Jiangxia District in Wuhan, China. Demographic data, medical history, and laboratory parameters were taken from inpatient records and compared between patients at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and non-ICU isolation wards for prognosis on disease severity. In particular, survivors and non-survivors upon ICU admission were compared for prognosis on disease mortality.

ResultsFor COVID-19 patients, blood test results showed more significantly deranged values in the ICU group than those in non-ICU. Among those parameters for ICU patients, myocardial variables including troponin T, creatine kinase isoenzymes, myoglobin, were found significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors.

ConclusionsUpon hospitalization abnormal myocardial metabolism in COVID-19 patients could be prognostic indicators of a worsened outcome for disease severity and mortality.","Zhang, J.; Ding, D.; Cao, C.; Zhang, J.; Huang, X.; Fu, P.; Liang, G.; Xu, W.; Tao, Z.",2020-05-09,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.06.20068882,1,Zhimin Tao,"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.20068882v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.20068882v1.full.pdf,cc_no,"NA"
28237,Emergence of immune escape at dominant SARS-CoV-2 killer T-cell epitope,"The adaptive immune system protects against infection via selection of specific antigen receptors on B-cells and T-cells. We studied the prevalent CD8  killer T-cell response mounted against SARS-CoV-2 Spike269-277 epitope YLQPRTFLL via the most frequent Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I worldwide, HLA A*02. The widespread Spike P272L mutation has arisen in five different SARS-CoV-2 lineages to date and was common in the B.1.177 lineage associated with establishing the  second wave in Europe. The large CD8 T-cell response seen across a cohort of HLA A*02+ convalescent patients, comprising of over 120 different TCRs, failed to respond to the P272L variant suggesting that proline 272 dominates TCR contacts with this epitope. Additionally, sizable populations (0.01%-0.2%) of total CD8 T-cells from individuals vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 stained with HLA A*02-YLQPRTFLL multimers but failed to bind to the P272L reagent. Viral escape at prevalent T-cell epitopes restricted by high frequency HLA may be particularly problematic when vaccine immunity is focussed on a single protein such as SARS-CoV-2 Spike and provides a strong argument for inclusion of multiple viral proteins in next generation vaccines and highlights the urgent need for monitoring T-cell escape in new SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Dolton, G.; Rius, C.; Hasan, M.

11000,Early COVID-19 Interventions Failed to Replicate 1918 St. Louis vs. Philadelphia Outcomes in the United States,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has elicited an abrupt pause in the United States in multiple sectors of commerce and social activity. As the US faces this health crisis, the magnitude, and rigor of their initial public health response was unprecedented. As a response, the entire nation shutdown at the state-level for the duration of approximately one to three months. These public health interventions, however, were not arbitrarily decided, but rather, implemented as a result of evidence-based practices. These practices were a result of lessons learned during the 1918 influenza pandemic and the city-level non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) taken across the US. During the 1918 pandemic, two model cities, St. Louis, MO, and Philadelphia, PA, carried out two different approaches to address the spreading disease, which resulted in two distinctly different outcomes. Our group has evaluated the state-level public health response adopted by states across the US, with a focus on New York, California, Florida, and Texas, and compared the effectiveness of reducing the spread of COVID-19. Our assessments show that while the states mentioned above benefited from the implementations of early preventative measures, they inadequately replicated the desired outcomes observed in St. Louis during the 1918 crisis. Our study indicates that there are other factors, including health disparities that may influence the effectiveness of public health interventions applied. Identifying more specific health determinants may help implement targeted interventions aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 and improving health equity.","Jalali, A. M.; Peterson, B.

4090,"A streamlined approach to rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, avoiding RNA extraction","In the current pandemic, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples by nucleic acid (NA) molecular analysis is the only method available to diagnose COVID-19 disease and to assess patients infectiveness. Recently, the demand for laboratory reagents has greatly increased; in particular, there is a worldwide shortage of RNA extraction kits. Here, we describe a fast, simple and inexpensive method for the detection of SARS CoV-2 RNA, which includes a pretreatment with Proteinase K and a heating-cooling cycle before the amplification. This method bypasses the RNA extraction step; it leads to a higher amount of available viral RNA compared to the automated extraction methods, and generates the same profile in the subsequent amplification phase.","Marzinotto, S.; Mio, C.; Cifu', A.; Verardo, R.; Pipan, C.; Schneider, C.; Curcio, F.",2020-04-11,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.06.20054114,1,Francesco Curcio,"Department of Laboratory Medicine, ASU FC, Udine, Italy",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20054114v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20054114v1.full.pdf,cc_by,"NA"
7180,Analysis of the time and age dependence of the case-fatality-ratio for COVID-19 in seven countries with a high total-to-positive test ratio suggests that the true CFR may be significantly underestimated for the United States in current models,"BackgroundKnowing the true infected and symptomatic case fatality ratios (IFR and CFR) for COVID-19 is of high importance for epidemiological model projections. A large correction factor is usually applied for missed cases. For the United State reported CFR of 5.96%, the estimated IFR values are 10-50-fold lower, justified by early reported CFR values of 0.1% to 0.5% in countries with more extensive testing. However, since then these values have risen 5 to 10-fold. We analyzed their age dependent CFR time courses to explain this increase and to determine whether a common factor can explain their CFRs.

MethodsAge dependent time to fatality corrected CFR was calculated using two independent methods. A linear model was developed that predicts CFR based on age dependent CFR coefficients and the age distribution of cases. The model was tested by a linear regression of each countrys CFR against case percentage of 70 years and over. The model was further tested by calculating the percent of the population in New York City who have been infected.

ResultsCorrected CFR values ranged from 0.58% to 5.0%. The large majority of CFR variation was explained by case age distribution above 70 years old. Using the CFR derived from the linear model we predicted between 14.7% and 22% of the adult population in NYC had been infected by COVID-19, in agreement with random testing studies (15.3% - 21%).

ConclusionsThe large rise in the reported CFR is due to the delay time between infection/diagnosis and fatality with COVID-19. The linear model based on their age specific CFR values provides an alternative method for calculating the true CFR in other regions. Most of the variation in CFR between countries was dependent on case age distribution, which must be considered in measures for mitigating the extensive impacts of the pandemic.","Rothman, J.; Eidelberg, D.; Rothman, S.; Holford, T.; Rothman, D.

11852,Training and reployment of non-specialists is an effective solution for the shortage of health care workers in the COVID-19 pandemic,"ImportanceIn the COVID-19 pandemic many countries encounter problems arising from shortage of specialists. Short intensive training and reployment of non-specialists is an option but the effectiveness is unknown.

ObjectiveTo investigate whether there was difference in in-hospital mortality rates between COVID-19 patients managed by a mixed team (including non-specialists who had short intensive training and operated to a strict protocol) and those managed by a specialist team of health care workers.

DesignCohort study, from January 26, 2020 to April 7, 2020, follow up to April 7, 2020.

SettingMulticenter - Wuhan Hankou Hospital and Wuhan Xiehe Hospital, Wuhan, China.

Participants261 HCWs deployed to Wuhan from Guangdong emergency rescue team and the 269 COVID-19 patients they treated.

ExposureAmong 261 health care workers, 130 were in the specialist team and included 33 physicians, 32 of whom (97.0%) of whom were from relevant specialties. Each physician was in charge of 25-27 beds, with a 6-hour shift time. The mixed team included 131 health care workers, with 7 of the 28 physicians (25.0%) from relevant specialties. Each physician managed 12-13 beds, with a 4-hour shift time.

Non-specialists received short-term intensive training and then followed strict management protocols. Specialists practiced as normal.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresMain outcome was in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients. Another outcome was rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care workers.

ResultsA total of 269 patients were included (144 male). In-hospital mortality rate of patients treated by the specialist teams and the mixed teams was 12.6% (20/159) and 12.7% (14/110) respectively (Difference = -0.1%, 95% CI -8.2% to 7.9%, p=.97). None of the health care workers were infected.

Conclusions and RelevanceTraining and reployment of non-specialists is an effective solution for the shortage of health care workers in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWas there difference in mortality rates between COVID-19 patients managed by a mixed team (including non-specialists who had short intensive training and operated to a strict protocol) and those managed by a specialist team of health care workers (HCWs)?

FindingsIn-hospital mortality rate among patients managed by specialist team (130 HCWs, 159 patients) and mixed team (131 HCWs, 110 patients) was 12.6% (20/159) and 12.7% (14/110) respectively (Difference = -0.1%, 95% CI -8.2% to 7.9%, p=.97).

MeaningWith shortage of specialist HCWs, training and reployment of non-specialists is an effective option in the management of COVID-19 patients.","Kuang, M.; Wu, J.; Luo, Y.; Xiao, H.; Liang, R.; Hu, W.; Cheng, S.; Zhou, Q.; Peng, S.; Cheng, K.; Xiao, H.",2020-07-17,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.07.17.20156117,1,Haipeng Xiao,The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20156117v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20156117v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,"NA"
22072,SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses are lower in children and increase with age and time after infection,"SARS-CoV-2 infection of children leads to a mild illness and the immunological differences with adults remains unclear. We quantified the SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses in adults and children (<13 years of age) with RT-PCR confirmed asymptomatic and symptomatic infection for long-term memory, phenotype and polyfunctional cytokines. Acute and memory CD4+ T cell responses to structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins significantly increased with age, whilst CD8+ T cell responses increased with time post infection. Infected children had significantly lower CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 structural and ORF1ab proteins compared to infected adults. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses were comparable in magnitude to uninfected negative adult controls. In infected adults CD4+ T cell specificity was skewed towards structural peptides, whilst children had increased contribution of ORF1ab responses. This may reflect differing T cell compartmentalisation for antigen processing during antigen exposure or lower recruitment of memory populations. T cell polyfunctional cytokine production was comparable between children and adults, but children had a lower proportion of SARS-CoV-2 CD4+ T cell effector memory. Compared to adults, children had significantly lower levels of antibodies to {beta}-coronaviruses, indicating differing baseline immunity. Total T follicular helper responses was increased in children during acute infection indicating rapid co-ordination of the T and B cell responses. However total monocyte responses were reduced in children which may be reflective of differing levels of inflammation between children and adults. Therefore, reduced prior {beta}-coronavirus immunity and reduced activation and recruitment of de novo responses in children may drive milder COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Cohen, C. A.; Li, A.

5745,Protective elements of mental health status during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Portuguese population,"The outbreak of COVID-19 might produce dramatic psychological effects on the individuals life. In this study, we aimed to explore the elements that may reduce the negative effects on mental health of the quarantine period imposed by most governments during this worldwide crisis. We conducted an online survey to evaluate demographic, lifestyle and mental health variables in the Portuguese population. We observed that factors related with living conditions, maintaining the work either online or in the workplace, frequency of exercise and absence of a previous psychological or physic disorders are protective features of psychological well-being (anxiety, depression, stress and obsessive-compulsive symptoms). Finally, the individuals previously receiving psychotherapeutic support exhibited better psychological indicators if they did not interrupt the process as a consequence of the outbreak. Our results indicate that the practice of physical exercise, reduced consumption of COVID-19 information and the implementation of remote mental healthcare measures might prevent larger impacts on mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Moreira, P.

28219,Differentials in the characteristics of COVID-19 cases in Wave-1 and Wave-2 admitted to a network of hospitals in North India,"Second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in India came with unexpected quick speed and intensity, creating an acute shortage of beds, ventilators, and oxygen at the peak of occurrence. This may have been partly caused by emergence of new variant delta. Clinical experience with the cases admitted to hospitals suggested that it is not merely a steep rise in cases but also possibly the case-profile is different. This study was taken up to investigate the differentials in the characteristics of the cases admitted in the second wave versus those admitted in the first wave.

Records of a total of 14398 cases admitted in the first wave (2020) to our network of hospitals in north India and 5454 cases admitted in the second wave (2021) were retrieved, making it the largest study of this kind in India. Their demographic profile, clinical features, management, and outcome was studied.

Age-sex distribution of the cases in the second wave was not much different from those admitted in the first wave but the patients with comorbidities and those with greater severity had larger share. Level of inflammatory markers was more adverse. More patients needed oxygen and invasive ventilation. ICU admission rate remained nearly the same. On the positive side, readmissions were lower, and the duration of hospitalization was slightly less. Usage of drugs like remdesivir and IVIG was higher while that of favipiravir and tocilizumab was lower. Steroid and anticoagulant use remained high and almost same during the two waves. More patients had secondary bacterial and fungal infections in Wave-2. Mortality increased by almost 40% in Wave-2, particularly in the younger patients of age less than 45 years. Higher mortality was observed in those admitted in wards, ICU, with or without ventilator support and those who received convalescent plasma.

No significant demographic differences in the cases in these two waves, indicates the role of other factors such as delta variant and late admissions in higher severity and more deaths. Comorbidity and higher secondary bacterial and fungal infections may have contributed to increased mortality.","Budhiraja, S.; Indrayan, A.; Aggarwal, M.; Jha, V.; Jain, D.; Tarai, B.; Das, P.; Aggarwal, B.; Mishra, R.
