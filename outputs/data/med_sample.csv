9545,The male excess in case-fatality rates for COVID-19. A meta-analytic study of the age-related differences and consistency over six countries,"BackgroundEarly in the COVID-19 pandemic, it was noted that males seemed to be more affected than females. We examined the magnitude and consistency of the sex differences in age-specific case-fatality rates (CFRs) in six countries.

MethodsData on the cases and deaths from COVID-19, by sex and age group, were extracted from the published reports from Denmark, England, Israel, Italy, Spain, and the United States. Age-specific CFRs were computed for males and females separately. The ratio of the male to female CFRs were computed and meta-analytic methods were used to obtained pooled estimates of the male to female ratio of the CFRs over the six countries, for seven age-groups.

FindingsThe CFRs were consistently higher in males at all ages. The differences were greater in the younger age groups. The pooled M:F CFR ratios were 2.53, 2.92, 2.57, 1.83, 1.57, 1.58 and 1.48 for ages 0-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89 and 90+. There was remarkable consistency between countries in the magnitude of the M:F CFRs, in each age group. In meta-regression, age group explained almost all the heterogeneity in the CFR ratios.

ConclusionsThe sex differences in the CFRs are intriguing and are compatible with the male dominance in the incidence rates of many infectious diseases. For COVID-19, factors such as sex differences in the prevalence of underlying diseases may play a part in the CFR differences. However, the greater severity of the disease in males, particularly at younger ages, may be part of the disease mechanism and should be explored further.

2781,AAEDM: Theoretical Dynamic Epidemic Diffusion Model and Covid-19 Korea Pandemic Cases,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThis paper deals with an advanced analytical epidemic diffusion model which is capable to predict the status of epidemic impacts. This newly propose model well describes an epidemic growth and it could be widely applied into various topics including pathology, epidemiology, business and data sciences. The Advanced Analytical Epidemic Diffusion Model (AAEDM) is a dynamic diffusion prediction model which is theoretically intuitive and its tractable closed formula could be easily adapted into versatile Bigdata driven analytics including the machine learning system. This dynamic model is still an analytical model but the periods of prediction are segmented for adapting the values from the dataset when the data is available. The epidemiologically vital parameters which effect on the AAEDM are also introduced in this paper. The evaluation of this theoretical model based on the Covid-19 data in Korea has been accomplished with relative fair future prediction accuracies. Although this analytical model has been designed from a basic exponential growth model, the performance of the AAEDM is competitive with other Bigdata based simulation models. Since the AAEDM is relatively simple and handy, anyone can use this model into analyzing outbreak situations in his daily life.","Kim, S.-K.",2020-03-27,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.03.17.20037838,2,Song-Kyoo Kim,Macao Polytechnic Institute,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037838v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037838v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
9144,Heart Disease Deaths during the Covid-19 Pandemic,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is associated with a reduction in hospitalization for an acute cardiovascular conditions. In a major health system in Massachusetts, there was a 43% reduction in these types of hospitalizations in March 2020 compared with March 2019.4 Whether mortality rates from heart disease have changed over this period is unknown.

We assembled information from the National Center for Health Statistics (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) for 118,356,533 person-weeks from Week 1 (ending January 4) through Week 17 (ending April 25) of 2020 for the state of Massachusetts.

9630,How much leeway is there to relax COVID-19 control measures?,"Following successful widespread non-pharmaceutical interventions aiming to control COVID-19, many jurisdictions are moving towards reopening economies and borders. Given that little immunity has developed in most populations, re-establishing higher contact rates within and between populations carries substantial risks. Using a Bayesian epidemiological model, we estimate the leeway to reopen in a range of national and regional jurisdictions that have experienced different COVID-19 epidemics. We estimate the risks associated with different levels of reopening and the likely burden of new cases due to introductions from other jurisdictions. We find widely varying leeway to reopen, high risks of exceeding past peak sizes, and high possible burdens per introduced case per week, up to hundreds in some jurisdictions. We recommend a cautious approach to reopening economies and borders, coupled with strong monitoring for changes in transmission.","Anderson, S. C.; Mulberry, N.; Edwards, A. M.; Stockdale, J.

10263,Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) levels in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 are associated with greater disease severity: results of a local audit of practice.,"ObjectivesTo audit implementation of a local protocol for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) among patients hospitalized for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), including an assessment of the prevalence of VDD in these patients, and of potential associations with disease severity and fatality.

DesignThis was not a study or clinical trial, but rather a retrospective interim audit (Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals Registration No. 10075) of a local clinical care pathway for hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related illness. The Information (Caldicott) Guardian permitted these data to be shared beyond the confines of our institution.

SettingA large tertiary academic NHS Foundation Trust in the North East of England, UK, providing care to COVID-19 patients.

ParticipantsOne hundred thirty-four hospitalized patients with documented COVID-19 infection.

Main outcome measuresAdherence to local investigation and treatment protocol; prevalence of VDD, and relationship of baseline serum 25(OH)D with markers of COVID-19 severity and inpatient fatality versus recovery.

Results55.8% of eligible patients received Colecalciferol replacement, albeit not always loaded as rapidly as our protocol suggested, and no cases of new hypercalcaemia occurred following treatment. Patients admitted to ITU were younger than those managed on medical wards (61.1 years {+/-} 11.8 vs. 76.4 years {+/-} 14.9, p<0.001), with greater prevalence of hypertension, and higher baseline respiratory rate, National Early Warning Score-2 and C-reactive protein level. While mean serum 25(OH)D levels were comparable [i.e. ITU: 33.5 nmol/L {+/-} 16.8 vs. Non-ITU: 48.1 nmol/L {+/-} 38.2, mean difference for Ln-transformed-25(OH)D: 0.14, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) (-0.15, 0.41), p=0.3], only 19% of ITU patients had 25(OH)D levels greater than 50 nmol/L vs. 39.1% of non-ITU patients (p=0.02). However, we found no association with fatality, potentially due to small sample size, limitations of no-trial data and, potentially, the prompt diagnosis and treatment of VDD.

ConclusionsSubject to the inherent limitations of observational (non-trial) audit data, analysed retrospectively, we found that patients requiring ITU admission were more frequently vitamin D deficient than those managed on medical wards, despite being significantly younger. Larger prospective studies and/or clinical trials are needed to elucidate the role of vitamin D as a preventive and/or therapeutic strategy for mitigating the effects of COVID-19 infection in patients with VDD.

What this study addsO_LIThese data do not arise from a clinical study; rather from an audit of a local replacement protocol for VDD in COVID-19 inpatients in a large UK centre, which found a significantly higher prevalence of VDD among ITU patients compared to non-ITU patients, despite the ITU patients being significantly younger.
C_LIO_LIPrompt treatment of VDD following a local protocol did not result in any adverse events, such as hypercalcaemia.
C_LIO_LIWhilst by no means conclusive, these data suggest an important association between VDD and COVID-19 severity; hence our report of interim findings in advance of achieving completed outcomes (fatality vs. recovery) for all patients.
C_LIO_LIThere is an urgent need for larger studies exploring vitamin D as a potential preventative measure and/or treatment of Covid-19-related illness among individuals with VDD.

17690,COVID-19 pandemic risk analytics: Data mining with reliability engineering methods for analyzing spreading behavior and comparison with infectious diseases,"In December 2019, the world was confronted with the outbreak of the respiratory disease COVID-19 (Corona). The first infection (confirmed case) was detected in the City Wuhan, Hubei, China. First, it was an epidemic in China, but in the first quarter of 2020, it evolved into a pandemic, which continues to this day. The COVID-19 pandemic with its incredible speed of spread shows the vulnerability of a globalized and networked world. The first months of the pandemic were characterized by heavy burden on health systems. Worldwide, the population of countries was affected with severe restrictions, like educational system shutdown, public traffic system breakdown or a comprehensive lockdown. The severity of the burden was dependent on many factors, e.g. government, culture or health system. However, the burden happened regarding each country with slight time lags, cf. Bracke et al. (2020). This paper focuses on data analytics regarding infection data of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a continuation of the research study COVID-19 pandemic data analytics: Data heterogeneity, spreading behavior, and lockdown impact, published by Bracke et al. (2020). The goal of this assessment is the evaluation/analysis of infection data mining considering model uncertainty, pandemic spreading behavior with lockdown impact and early second wave in Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand and France. Furthermore, a comparison with other infectious diseases (measles and influenza) is made. The used data base from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) runs from 01/22/2020 until 09/22/2020 with daily data, the dynamic development after 09/22/2020 is not considered. The measles/influenza analytics are based on Robert Koch Institute (RKI) data base 09/22/2020. Statistical models and methods from reliability engineering like Weibull distribution model or trend test are used to analyze the occurrence of infection.","Puls, A.; Bracke, S.",2020-11-12,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.11.08.20227322,1,Stefan Bracke,University of Wuppertal,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.08.20227322v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.08.20227322v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
8360,How did governmental interventions affect the spread of COVID-19 in European countries?,"BackgroundTo reduce transmission of Coronavirus Disease 2019, European governments have implemented successive measures to encourage social distancing. However, it remained unclear how effectively measures reduced the spread of the virus, due to data complications. We examined how the effective-contact rate (ECR) among European citizens evolved over the period with implemented measures using a new data-oriented approach that is based on an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model.

MethodsUsing the available data on the confirmed numbers of infections and hospitalizations, we first estimated the daily number of infectious-, exposed- and susceptible individuals and subsequently estimated the ECR with an iterative Poisson regression model, disregarding information on governmental measures. We then studied change points in the daily ECRs to the moments of the governmental measures.

FindingsThe change points in the daily ECRs were found to align with the implementation of governmental interventions. At the end of the considered time-window, we found similar ECRs for Italy (0{middle dot}29), Spain (0{middle dot}24), and Germany (0{middle dot}27), while the ECR in the Netherlands (0{middle dot}34), Belgium (0{middle dot}35) and the UK (0{middle dot}37) were somewhat higher. The highest ECR was found for Sweden (0{middle dot}45).

InterpretationThere seemed to be an immediate effect of banning events and closing schools, typically among the first measures taken by the governments. The effect of additionally closing bars and restaurants seemed limited. For most countries a somewhat delayed effect of the full lockdown was observed, and the ECR after a full lockdown was not necessarily lower than an ECR after (only) a gathering ban.","Post, R. A.

18272,Antibody response patterns in COVID-19 patients with different levels of disease severity-Japan,"BackgroundWe analyzed antibody response patterns according to level of disease severity in patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Japan.

MethodsWe analyzed 611 serum specimens from 231 patients with COVID-19 (mild, 170; severe, 31; critical, 30). IgM and IgG antibodies against nucleocapsid protein (N) and spike 1 protein (S1) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.

FindingsThe peaks of fitting curves for the OD values of IgM and IgG antibodies against N appeared simultaneously, while those against S1 were delayed compared with N. The OD values of IgM against N and IgG against both N and S1 were significantly higher in the severe and critical cases than in the mild cases at 11 days after symptom onset. The seroconversion rates of IgG were higher than those of IgM against both N and S1 during the clinical course based on the optimal cut-off values defined in this study. The seroconversion rates of IgG and IgM against N and S1 were higher in the severe and critical cases than in the mild cases.

ConclusionOur findings show that a stronger antibody response occurred in COVID-19 patients with greater disease severity and there were low seroconversion rates of antibodies against N and S1 in the mild cases. The antibody response patterns in our population suggest a second infection pattern, leading us to hypothesize that cross-reactivity occurs between SARS-CoV-2 and past infection with other human coronaviruses.","Imai, K.; Kitagawa, Y.; Tabata, S.; Kubota, K.; Ikeda, M.; Matuoka, M.; Miyoshi, K.; Sakai, J.; Ishibashi, N.; Tarumoto, N.; Takeuchi, S.; Ito, T.; Maesaki, S.; Tamura, K.; Maeda, T.",2020-11-23,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.11.20.20231696,1,Kazuo Imai,Saitama Medical University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.20.20231696v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.20.20231696v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
18169,Risk of evolutionary escape from neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"As many prophylactics targeting SARS-CoV-2 are aimed at the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), we examined the risk of immune evasion from previously published RBD-targeting neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Epitopes for RBD-targeting nAbs overlap one another substantially and can give rise to escape mutants with ACE2 affinities comparable to wild type that still infect cells in vitro. We used evolutionary modeling to predict the frequency of immune escape before and after the widespread presence of nAbs due to vaccines, passive immunization or natural immunity. Our modeling suggests that SARS-CoV-2 mutants with one or two mildly deleterious mutations are expected to exist in high numbers due to neutral genetic variation, and consequently resistance to single or double antibody combinations can develop quickly under positive selection.

One Sentence SummarySARS-CoV-2 will evolve quickly to evade widely deployed spike RBD-targeting monoclonal antibodies, requiring combinations that rely on at least three antibodies targeting distinct epitopes to suppress viral immune evasion.","Van Egeren, D.; Novokhodko, A.; Stoddard, M.; Tran, U.; Zetter, B.; Rogers, M.; Pentelute, B.

6034,Chloroquine Administration in Breastfeeding Mothers Associates with Increased HIV-1 Plasma Viral Loads,"Chloroquine (CQ) and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been proposed to be effective at treating COVID-19 patients. We, and others, have previously reported on the capacity of CQ to reduce HIV-1 replication in vitro. We tested CQ administration in post-partum mothers on influencing HIV-1 viral loads in human milk as a means of lowering mother to child transmission. A Phase I/II, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate chloroquine administration to reduce HIV-1 RNA levels in human milk: the CHARGE study. Thirty HIV-1 positive pregnant Rwandese women (CQ n = 20; placebo n = 10) were enrolled in a 16-week study, with the treatment group receiving a 200 mg oral dose of CQ daily. Base-line plasma viral load (pVL) measurements and CD4 counts were determined prior to delivery, and pVL, breast milk VL (bmVL) and CQ levels measured during treatment. For women receiving treatment, CQ concentration was higher in breast milk compared to plasma (over 2.5-fold), with a positive correlation between the levels in the two compartments (P < 0.003). A link between high CQ concentrations in plasma and high CD4 counts (P < 0.001) was observed. Surprisingly, we found a significant increase in pVL after CQ treatment in over half of the mothers (n=11; P < 0.001) and with no alteration to bmVL measurements. No specific amino acid alterations in the gp120 envelope sequences could be associated with CQ administration. CQ usage is associated with a significant increase to pVL in early breastfeeding mothers from Rwanda which cautions against the use of CQ in such individuals. Our results highlight a discrepancy between CQ effects on modulating HIV-1 replication in vitro versus in vivo and indicate caution when prescribing CQ to postpartum HIV-1 untreated mothers. This discrepancy should be taken into consideration when testing CQ or HCQ treatment in COVID-19 clinical trials, especially relating to the post-partum setting.","Paxton, W. A.; Naarding, M.

15861,COVID-19 Classification of X-ray Images Using Deep Neural Networks,"ObjectivesIn the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is playing an important role in diagnosis and monitoring of patients with COVID-19. Machine learning solutions have been shown to be useful for X-ray analysis and classification in a range of medical contexts. In this study, we propose a machine learning model for detection of patients tested positive for COVID-19 from CXRs that were collected from inpatients hospitalized in four different hospitals. We additionally present a tool for retrieving similar patients according to the models results on their CXRs.

MethodsIn this retrospective study, 1384 frontal CXRs, of COVID-19 confirmed patients imaged between March-August 2020, and 1024 matching CXRs of non-COVID patients imaged before the pandemic, were collected and used to build a deep learning classifier for detecting patients positive for COVID-19. The classifier consists of an ensemble of pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNS), specifically, ReNet34, ReNet50, ReNet152, vgg16, and is enhanced by data augmentation and lung segmentation. We further implemented a nearest-neighbors algorithm that uses DNN-based image embeddings to retrieve the images most similar to a given image.

ResultsOur model achieved accuracy of 90.3%, (95%CI: 86.3%-93.7%) specificity of 90% (95%CI: 84.3%-94%), and sensitivity of 90.5% (95%CI: 85%-94%) on a test dataset comprising 15% (350/2326) of the original images. The AUC of the ROC curve is 0.96 (95%CI: 0.93-0.97).

ConclusionWe provide deep learning models, trained and evaluated on CXRs that can assist medical efforts and reduce medical staff workload in handling COVID-19.

Key PointsO_LIA machine learning model was able to detect chest X-ray (CXR) images of patients tested positive for COVID-19 with accuracy and detection rate above 90%.
C_LIO_LIA tool was created for finding existing CXR images with imaging characteristics most similar to a given CXR, according to the models image embeddings.

3779,Validation of reported risk factors for disease classification and prognosis in COVID-19: a descriptive and retrospective study,"Risk indicators viral load (ORF1ab Ct), lymphocyte percentage (LYM%), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT) and lactic acid (LA) in COVID-19 patients have been proposed in recent studies. However, the predictive effects of those indicators on disease classification and prognosis remains largely unknown. We dynamically measured those reported indicators in 132 cases of COVID-19 patients including the moderate-cured (moderated and cured), severe-cured (severe and cured) and critically ill (died). Our data showed that CRP, PCT, IL-6, LYM%, lactic acid and viral load could predict prognosis and guide classification of COVID-19 patients in different degrees. CRP, IL-6 and LYM% were more effective than other three factors in predicting prognosis. For disease classification, CRP and LYM% were sensitive in identifying the types between critically ill and severe (or moderate). Notably, among the investigated factors, LYM% was the only one that could distinguish between the severe and moderate types. Collectively, we concluded that LYM% was the most sensitive and reliable predictor for disease typing and prognosis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the precise classification and prognosis prediction are critical for saving the insufficient medical resources, stratified treatment and improving the survival rate of critically ill patients. We recommend that LYM% be used independently or in combination with other indicators in the management of COVID-19.","Tan, L.; Kang, X.; Ji, X.; Wang, Q.; Li, Y.; Wang, Q.; Miao, H.",2020-04-07,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.05.20053769,1,Hongming Miao,Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University),https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20053769v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20053769v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
16170,Low zinc levels at clinical admission associates with poor outcomes in COVID-19,"BackgroundBiomarkers to predict Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outcome early at infection are urgently needed to improve prognosis and treatment. Zinc balances immune responses and also has a proven direct antiviral action against some viruses. Importantly, zinc deficiency (ZD) is a common condition in elderly and individuals with chronic diseases, two groups with more severe COVID-19 outcomes. We hypothesize that serum zinc content (SZC) influences COVID-19 disease progression and thus might represent a useful biomarker.

MethodsWe run a retrospective observational study with 249 COVID-19 patients admitted in Hospital del Mar. We have studied COVID-19 severity and progression attending to SZC at admission. In parallel we have studied SARS-CoV2 replication in the Vero E6 cell line modifying zinc concentrations.

FindingsOur study demonstrates a correlation between serum zinc levels and COVID-19 outcome. Serum zinc levels lower than 50 {micro}g/dl at admission correlated with worse clinical presentation, longer time to reach stability and higher mortality. Our in vitro results indicate that low zinc levels favor viral expansion in SARS-CoV2 infected cells.

InterpretationSZC is a novel biomarker to predict COVID-19 outcome. We encourage performing randomized clinical trials to study zinc supplementation as potential prophylaxis and treatment with people at risk of zinc deficiency.

16447,Measurement of small droplet aerosol concentrations in public spaces using handheld particle counters,"We investigate the role of aerosols in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in public spaces. Direct measurement of aerosol concentrations however has proven technically difficult; we propose the use of handheld particle counters as a novel and easily applicable method to measure aerosol concentrations. This allow us to perform measurements in typical public spaces, each differing in volume, number of people and ventilation rate. These data are used to estimate the relation between aerosol persistence time and the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2.","Somsen, G. A.; Van Rijn, C.; Kooy, S.; Bem, R.

5968,Single-cell Transcriptome Analysis Indicates New Potential Regulation Mechanism of ACE2 and NPs signaling among heart failure patients infected with SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundCOVID-19 patients with comorbidities such as hypertension or heart failure (HF) are associated with poor clinical outcomes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the critical enzyme for SARS-CoV-2 infection, is broadly expressed in many organs including heart. However, the cellular distribution of ACE2 in the human heart, particularly the failing heart is unknown.

MethodsWe analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data in both normal and failing hearts, and characterized the ACE2 gene expression profile in various cell subsets, especially in cardiomyocyte subsets, as well as its interaction with gene networks relating to various defense and immune responses at the single cell level.

ResultsThe results demonstrated that ACE2 is present in cardiomyocytes (CMs), endothelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells in the heart, while the number of ACE2-postive (ACE2+) CMs and ACE2 gene expression in these CMs are significantly increased in the failing hearts. Interestingly, both brain natriuretic peptides (BNP) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) are significantly up-regulated in the ACE2+ CMs. Further analysis shows that ANP, BNP and ACE2 may form a negative feedback loop with a group of genes associated with the development of heart failure. To our surprise, we found that genes related to virus entry, virus replication and suppression of interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) signaling are all up-regulated in CMs in failing hearts, and the increases were significantly higher in ACE2+ CMs as compared with ACE2 negative (ACE2-) CMs, suggesting that these ACE2+ CMs may be more vulnerable to virus infection. Since ACE2 expression is correlated with BNP expression, we further performed retrospective analysis of the plasma BNP levels and clinic outcome of 91 COVID-19 patients from a single-center. Patients with higher plasma BNP were associated with significantly higher mortality rate and expression levels of inflammatory and infective markers such as procalcitonin and C-reactive protein.

ConclusionIn the failing heart, the upregulation of ACE2 and virus infection associated genes, as well as the increased expression of ANP and BNP could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 virus entry and replication in these vulnerable cardiomyocyte subsets. These findings may advance our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of myocarditis associated with COVID-19.","Xu, X.; Xu, D.; Li, H.; Ma, M.; Xu, Y.; Su, Y.; Ong, S.-B.; Hu, X.; Cai, M.; Zhao, M.; Chen, Y.",2020-05-15,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.30.20081257,2,Xiaojiang Xu,"NIEHS, NIH",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.30.20081257v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.30.20081257v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
5410,Estimation of COVID-19 spread curves integrating global data and borrowing information,"Currently, novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a big threat to global health. The rapid spread of the virus has created pandemic, and countries all over the world are struggling with a surge in COVID-19 infected cases. There are no drugs or other therapeutics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent or treat COVID-19: information on the disease is very limited and scattered even if it exists. This motivates the use of data integration, combining data from diverse sources and eliciting useful information with a unified view of them. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that integrates global data for real-time prediction of infection trajectory for multiple countries. Because the proposed model takes advantage of borrowing information across multiple countries, it outperforms an existing individual country-based model. As fully Bayesian way has been adopted, the model provides a powerful predictive tool endowed with uncertainty quantification. Additionally, the proposed model uses countrywide covariates to adjust infection trajectories in curve fitting. A joint variable selection technique has been integrated into the proposed modeling scheme, which aimed to identify possible country-level risk factors for severe disease due to COVID-19.","Lee, S.

4984,"More prevalent, less deadly? Bayesian inference of the COVID19 Infection Fatality Ratio from mortality data","We use an established semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model of the COVID-19 pandemic [1], driven by European mortality data, to estimate the prevalence of immunity. We allow the infection-fatality ratio (IFR) to vary, adapt the models priors to better reflect emerging information, and re-evaluate the model fitting in the light of current mortality data. The results indicate that the IFR of COVID-19 may be an order of magnitude smaller than the current consensus, with the corollary that the virus is more prevalent than currently believed. These results emerge from a simple model and ought to be treated with caution. They emphasise the value of rapid community-scale antibody testing when this becomes available.","Delius, G.

15528,Performance of a point of care test for detecting IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and seroprevalence in blood donors and health care workers in Panama,"Novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has reached 28 million cases worldwide in eight months. The serological detection of antibodies against the virus will play a pivotal role in complementing molecular tests to improve diagnostic accuracy, contact tracing, vaccine efficacy testing and seroprevalence surveillance. Here, we aimed first to evaluate a lateral flow assays ability to identify specific IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and second, to report the seroprevalence of these antibodies among health care workers and healthy volunteer blood donors in Panama. We recruited study participants between April 30th and July 7th, 2020. For the test validation and performance evaluation, we analyzed serum samples from participants with clinical symptoms and confirmed positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, and a set of pre-pandemic serum samples. We used two by two table analysis to determine the test sensitivity and specificity as well as the kappa agreement value with a 95% confidence interval. Then, we used the lateral flow assay to determine seroprevalence among serum samples from COVID-19 patients, potentially exposed health care workers, and healthy volunteer donors. Our results show this assay reached a positive percent agreement of 97.2% (95% CI 84.2-100.0%) for detecting both IgM and IgG. The assay showed a kappa of 0.898 (95%CI 0.811-0.985) and 0.918 (95% CI 0.839-0.997) for IgM and IgG, respectively. The evaluation of serum samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients indicates a correlation between test sensitivity and the number of days since symptom onset; the highest positive percent agreement (87% (95% CI 67.0-96.3%)) was observed at [&ge;]15 days post-symptom onset. We found an overall antibody seroprevalence of 11.6% (95% CI 8.5-15.8%) among both health care workers and healthy blood donors. Our findings suggest this lateral flow assay could contribute significantly to implementing seroprevalence testing in locations with active community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Villarreal, A.; Rangel, G.; Zhang, X.; Wong, D.; De La Guardia, C.; Britton, G.; Fernandez, P.

8581,Compliance and containment in social distancing: mathematical modeling of COVID-19 across townships,"In the early development of COVID-19, large-scale preventive measures, such as border control and air travel restrictions, were implemented to slow international and domestic transmissions. When these measures were in full effect, new cases of infection would be primarily induced by community spread, such as the human interaction within and between neighboring cities and towns, which is generally known as the meso-scale. Existing studies of COVID-19 using mathematical models are unable to accommodate the need for meso-scale modeling, because of the unavailability of COVID-19 data at this scale and the different timings of local intervention policies. In this respect, we propose a meso-scale mathematical model of COVID-19 using town-level infection data in the state of Connecticut. We consider the spatial interaction in terms of the inter-town travel in the model. Based on the developed model, we evaluated how different strengths of social distancing policy enforcement may impact future epidemic curves based on two evaluative metrics: compliance and containment. The developed model and the simulation results will establish the foundation for community-level assessment and better preparation for COVID-19.","Chen, X.; Zhang, A.; Wang, H.; Gallaher, A.; Zhu, X.",2020-06-02,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.06.01.20119073,1,Xiaolin Zhu,The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.01.20119073v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.01.20119073v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

There remains an urgent need to understand its transmission characteristics and design effective interventions to mitigate its spread. In this study, we define a non-linear (known in biochemistry models as allosteric or cooperative) relationship between viral shedding, viral dose and COVID-19 infection propagation. We develop a mathematical model of the dynamics of COVID-19 to link quantitative features of viral shedding, human exposure and transmission in nine countries impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The model was then used to evaluate the efficacy of interventions against virus transmission. We found that cooperativity was important to capture country-specific transmission dynamics and leads to resistance to mitigating transmission in mild or moderate interventions. The behaviors of the model emphasize that strict interventions greatly limiting both virus shedding and human exposure are indispensable to achieving effective containment of COVID-19.","Dai, Z.; Locasale, J.

With the Retarded SEIRS model and this criterion, we can predict whether the Covid-19 will re-emerge. So far, a large number of researches that have been presented in scientific groups or communities have been based on the SIR or SEIR model.

18904,Surgery & COVID-19: A rapid scoping review of the impact of COVID-19 on surgical services during public health emergencies,"BackgroundHealthcare systems globally have been challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating the reorganization of surgical services to free capacity within healthcare systems.

ObjectivesTo understand how surgical services have been reorganized during and following public health emergencies, and the consequences of these changes for patients, healthcare providers and healthcare systems.

MethodsThis rapid scoping review searched academic databases and grey literature sources to identify studies examining surgical service delivery during public health emergencies including COVID-19, and the impact on patients, providers and healthcare systems. Recommendations and guidelines were excluded. Screening was completed in partial (title, abstract) or complete (full text) duplicate following pilot reviews of 50 articles to ensure reliable application of eligibility criteria.

ResultsOne hundred and thirty-two studies were included in this review; 111 described reorganization of surgical services, 55 described the consequences of reorganizing surgical services and six reported actions taken to rebuild surgical capacity in public health emergencies. Reorganizations of surgical services were grouped under six domains: case selection/triage, PPE regulations and practice, workforce composition and deployment, outpatient and inpatient patient care, resident and fellow education, and the hospital or clinical environment. Service reorganizations led to large reductions in non-urgent surgical volumes, increases in surgical wait times, and impacted medical training (i.e., reduced case involvement) and patient outcomes (e.g., increases in pain). Strategies for rebuilding surgical capacity were scarce, but focused on the availability of staff, PPE, and patient readiness for surgery as key factors to consider before resuming services.

ConclusionsReorganization of surgical services in response to public health emergencies appears to be context-dependent and has far-reaching consequences that must be better understood in order to optimize future health system responses to public health emergencies.

There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19, and no vaccine is currently available. This study aimed to understand the perception of the public towards a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria.

MethodWe conducted a cross-sectional survey in August 2020 across the 36 states of Nigeria using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire includes sections on the demographic characteristics of the respondents and their perception regarding a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 517 respondents completed and returned the informed consent along with the questionnaire electronically. Data were coded and abstracted into the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and loaded into the STATA 14 software for final analysis.

ResultsThe results showed that more than half of the respondents were male 294 (56.9%). Most of the respondents (385, 74.5%) intend to take the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available. Among the 132 respondents that would not take the COVID-19 vaccine, the major reason for non-acceptance was unreliability of the clinical trials 49 (37.1%), followed by the belief that their immune system was sufficient to combat the virus 36 (27.3%). There were significant association between the age of the respondents and the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (P-value=0.00) as well as geographical location and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (P-value=0.02).

ConclusionIt was observed that most of the respondents were willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Our findings reiterate the need to reassure the public that any vaccine that becomes available will be safe and effective. In addition, there is a need for the national health authorities to ensure the public trust is earned and all communities, including the marginalized populations, are engaged properly to ensure an optimal COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.","Adebisi, Y.

3264,Mitigation and herd immunity strategy for COVID-19 is likely to fail,"On the basis of a semi-realistic SIR microsimulation for Germany and Poland, we show that the R0 parameter interval for which the COVID-19 epidemic stays overcritical but below the capacity limit of the health care system to reach herd immunity is so narrow that a successful implementation of this strategy is likely to fail, which is in contrast to results obtained from classical differential equation models. Our microsimulation is based on official census data and involves household composition and age distribution as the main population structure variables. Outside household contacts are characterised by an out-reproduction number R* which is the only free parameter of the model. For a subcritical domain we compute the time till extinction and prevalence as a function of the initial number of infected individuals and R*.

12315,Effectiveness and Safety of Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine as a mono-therapy or in combination with Azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 patients: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Many recent studies have investigated the role of either Chloroquine (CQ) alone, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) alone, or CQ/HCQ in combination with azithromycin (AZM) in management of the emerging coronavirus. This systematic review and meta-analysis of either published or preprint observational or interventional studies were conducted to assess the cure rate, duration of hospital stay, radiological progression, clinical worsening, need for mechanical ventilation, the occurrence of side effects, and mortality. A search of the online database through June 2020 was performed and examined the reference lists of pertinent articles for in-vivo studies only. Pooled relative risks (RRs), standard mean, of 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with the random-effects model.

ResultsThe duration of hospital stay was shorter in the standard care in comparison with HCQ group, the standard mean of hospital stay was 0.57, 95% CI, and 0.20-0.94. Overall virological cure, or more specifically at day 4, 10, and 14 among patients exposed to HCQ did not differ significantly from the standard care [(RR=0.92, 95% CI 0.78-1.15), (RR=1.11, 95% CI 0.74-1.65), (RR=1.21, 95%CI 0.70-2.01), and (RR=0.98, 95% CI, 0.76-1.27)] respectively. Radiological improvement or clinical worsening was not statistically different between HCQ and standard care [(RR=1.11, 95% CI 0.64-1.65) and (RR=1.28, 95% CI 0.33-4.99)]. The need for mechanical ventilation (MV) was not significant between the HCQ group and the standard care (RR= 1.5, 95%CI 0.78-2.89). Side effects were more reported in the HCQ group than the standard care (RR=3.14, 95% CI 1.58-6.24). Mortality among HCQ was not affected by receiving HCQ (RR=3.14, 95% CI 1.58-6.24), meta-regression analysis revealed that country is a strong predictor of mortality. The duration of hospital stay among the HCQ and AZM didnt differ significantly from the standard care (standard mean= 0.77, 95% CI 0.46-1.08). Despite virological cure and need for MV did not differ significantly [(RR= 3.23, 95% CI 0.70-14.97) and (RR=1.27, 95%CI 0.7-2.13)] respectively. Mortality among the HCQ+AZM was more significantly higher than among the standard care (RR= 1.8, 95% CI 1.19-2.27).

ConclusionDespite the scarcity of published data of good quality, the effectiveness and safety of either HCQ alone or in combination with AZM in treating the pandemic of COVID-19 cant be assured. Future randomized control trials need to be carried out to verify this conclusion.

15588,Estimation of the fraction of COVID-19 infected people in U.S. states and countries worldwide,"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, daily counts of confirmed cases and deaths have been publicly reported in real-time to control the virus spread. However, substantial undocumented infections have obscured the true prevalence of the virus. A machine learning framework was developed to estimate time courses of actual new COVID-19 cases and current infections in 50 countries and 50 U.S. states from reported test results and deaths, as well as published epidemiological parameters. Severe under-reporting of cases was found to be universal. Our framework projects for countries like Belgium, Brazil, and the U.S. ~10% of the population has been once infected. In the U.S. states like Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida, more than 4% of the population is estimated to be currently infected, as of September 3, 2020, while in New York the fraction is 0.12%. The estimation of the actual fraction of currently infected people is crucial for any definition of public health policies, which up to this point may have been misguided by the reliance on confirmed cases.","Noh, J.; Danuser, G.",2020-09-28,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.09.26.20202382,1,Jungsik Noh,UT Southwestern Medical Center,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.26.20202382v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.26.20202382v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
21056,Mitigation policies and vaccination in the COVID-19 pandemic: a modelling study,"The perspective of vaccination to protect human population from infection of SARS-CoV-2 virus has great potential to control the pandemic. Nevertheless, vaccine planning requires phased introduction with age groups, health workers, and vulnerable people. We developed a mathematical model capable of capturing the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 dissemination aligned with social distancing, isolation measures, and vaccination. The city of Rio de Janeiro provides a case study to analyze possible scenarios including non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccination in the epidemic scenario. Our results shows that a combination of different policies such as case isolation and social distancing are more effective for mitigating the epidemics. Furthermore, these policies will still be necessary in a phased vaccination program. Therefore, health surveillance activities should be maintained along with vaccination planning in scheduled groups until a large vaccinated coverage is reached.","Valiati, N. C. M.; Villela, D. A.

16531,National Routine Adult Immunization Programs among World Health Organization Member States: An Assessment of Health Systems to Deploy Future SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines,"IntroductionAs the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic disproportionately affects older adults, future pandemic vaccine response will rely on existing adult immunization infrastructures.

MethodsWe evaluated the 2018 WHO/UNICEF Joint Reporting Form on Immunization for country reports on adult immunization programs. We described countries with programs and used multivariable regression to identify independent factors associated with having them.

ResultsOf 194 WHO Member States, 120 (62%) reported having any adult vaccination program. The Americas and Europe had the most adult immunization programs, most commonly Hepatitis B and influenza vaccines (>45% and >90% of countries). Africa and South-East Asia had the fewest adult immunization programs, with <11% of countries reporting any adult immunization programs for influenza or hepatitis vaccines, and none for pneumococcal vaccines. In bivariate analyses, high- or upper-middle income, introduction of new or underused vaccines, having achieved pediatric vaccine coverage goals, and meeting National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups basic functional indicators were significantly associated (p<0.001) with having any adult immunization programs. In multivariable analyses, the factor most strongly associated with adult immunization programs was country income, with high- or upper-middle income countries significantly more likely to report having a program (aOR 19.3, 95% CI 6.5, 57.7).

DiscussionThat 38% of countries lack functional platforms for adult immunization has major implications for future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine deployment. Systems for vaccine storage and handling, delivery, and waste management for adult immunization do not exist in much of the world. Developing countries should strengthen immunization programs to reach adults with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines when they become available.","Williams, S. R.; Driscoll, A. J.; Lebuhn, H. M.; Chen, W.

9746,Simulation of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions on COVID-19 with an Agent-based Model of Zonal Restraint,"Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) are currently the only mechanism governments can use to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic. Similarly to the actual spread of the disease, the dynamics of the contention patterns emerging from the application of NPIs are complex and depend on interactions between people within a specific region as well as other stochastic factors associated to demographic, geographic, political and economical conditions. Agent-based models simulate microscopic rules of simultaneous spatial interactions between multiple agents within a population, in an attempt to reproduce the complex dynamics of the effect of the contention measures. In this way, it is possible to design individual behaviours along with NPI scenarios, measuring how the simulation dynamics is affected and therefore, yielding rapid insights to perform a broad assessment of the potential of composite interventions at different stages of the epidemic. In this paper we describe a model and a tool to experiment with such kind of analysis applied to a conceptual city, considering a number of widely-applied NPIs such as social distancing, case isolation, home quarantine, total lockdown, sentinel testing, mask wearing and a distinctive ""zonal"" enforcement measure, requiring these interventions to be applied gradually to separated enclosed districts (zones). We find that the model is able to capture emerging dynamics associated to these NPIs; besides, the zonal contention strategy yields an improvement on the mitigation impact across all scenarios of combination with individual NPIs. The model and tool are open to extensions to account for omitted or newer factors affecting the planning and design of NPIs intended to counter the late stages or forthcoming waves of the COVID-19 crisis.","Rojas-Galeano, S.; Alvarez, L.",2020-06-16,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.13.20130542,1,Sergio Rojas-Galeano,Universidad Distrital Francisco Jose de Caldas,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.13.20130542v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.13.20130542v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
12745,Sooner than you think: a very early affective reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine in Argentina,"The unique circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic pose serious challenges to mood stability and emotional regulation at all ages. Although many people tend to react resiliently to stress, others appear to display emotional anxiety and depression-related symptoms. In this study, we carried out a survey (N = 10,053) during the first week of the general lockdown (quarantine) in Argentina to measure early affective reactions in Argentine adults. Respondents showed substantial anxious and depressive symptoms, with 33 % and 23% of participants reporting possible depressive and anxious syndromes, respectively, with the youngest group (18 to 25 y.o.) showing the highest prevalence of symptoms. Even if prior mental health problems predisposed or aggravated the reaction, participants without prior complaints showed signs of psychological impact. Using linear regression, the most important independent variables related to depressive symptoms was the feeling of loneliness followed by daily stress. In the case of anxious states, the strongest variables were negative repetitive thinking and feeling of loneliness. Other psychological, economic, and social factors are discussed.

This study is in line with previous literature that highlight the importance of the psychological impact of pandemics, but additionally demonstrates that these reactions are present at a large scale immediately after the start of quarantine with very low infectious rates as an early anticipatory adaptive reaction leading to potential negative outcomes from adjustment disorders to major disorders. In addition, the present results provide potentially relevant information about sudden environmental impacts on affective states and specific pathways for anxiety and depression to be expressed. We end by discussing implications for public policy based on considering the most vulnerable groups.

4517,Importance of untested infectious individuals for the suppression of COVID-19 epidemics,"The impact of the extent of testing infectious individuals on suppression of COVID-19 is illustrated from the early stages of outbreaks in Germany, the Hubei province of China, Italy, Spain and the UK. The predicted percentage of untested infected individuals depends on the specific outbreak but we found that they typically represent 50% to 80% of the infected individuals. Even when unreported cases are taken into account, we estimate that less than 8% of the population would have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by 09/04/2020 in the analysed outbreaks. These levels are far below the 70-85% needed to ensure herd immunity and would predict a resurgence of infection if ongoing lockdowns in the outbreaks are fully lifted. We propose that partially lifted lockdowns together with early and thorough testing allowing for quick isolation of both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases could lead to suppression of secondary waves of COVID-19 epidemics.","Perez-Reche, F.

13942,Trying to Find the Answer for Two Questions in Patients with COVID-19: 1. Is pulmonary infiltrate of COVID-19 infective or inflammatory in nature (Pneumonia or Pneumonitis)? 2. Is Hydroxychloroquine plus Azithromycin or Favipiravir plus Dexamethasone more effective in the COVID-19 treatment?,"BackgroundDuring the current pandemic, a great effort is made to understand the COVID-19 and find an effective treatment. As of 17 August 2020, there is no specific drug or biologic agent which have been approved by the FDA for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.

MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed the clinical and radiological findings of 211 COVID-19 in-patients that were treated between March - August 2020. Confirmation of a COVID-19 diagnosis was made according to a positive RT-PCR result with a consistent high-resolution- CT (HRCT) finding. Radiological images and the rate of clinical response of patients were investigated.

ResultWhile 128 patients (58.7) did not develop pneumonia, the mild, moderate and severe pneumonia ratios were 28(13.2%), 31(18.7%) and 27(22.9%). 72 patients (34.1%) whose PCR tests were positive did not show any symptom and they were followed in isolation without treatment. 52 patients (24.6%) received hydroxychloroquine plus azithyromycine, 57 patients (27%) received favipiravir and 30 patients (14.2%) received favipiravir plus dexamethosone as the first line of treatment. 63.1% of pneumonia patients who received hydroxychloroquine plus azithyromycine, 28.3% of patients who received favipravir and 10% of patients who received favipravir plus dexamethasone showed a failure of treatment.

ConclusionThe pulmonary infiltrates of COVID-19 are not infective; therefore, the characteristic of the disease should be described as COVID-19 pneumonitis instead of pneumonia. The favipiravir plus dexamethasone seems to be the only drug combination to achieve the improvement of radiological presentation and clinical symptoms in COVID-19 pneumonia patients.","Dirican, A.; Uzar, T.; Karaman, I.; Uluisik, A.; Ozkaya, S.",2020-09-01,Respiratory Medicine,10.1101/2020.08.25.20181388,2,Sevket Ozkaya,"., Bahcesehir University,Faculty of Medicine,Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.25.20181388v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.25.20181388v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
2289,"Preliminary epidemiological analysis on children and adolescents with novel coronavirus disease 2019 outside Hubei Province, China: an observational study utilizing crowdsourced data","BackgroundThe outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to expand across the world. Though both the number of cases and mortality rate in children and adolescents is reported to be low in comparison to adults, limited data has been reported on the outbreak with respect to pediatric patients. To elucidate information, we utilized crowdsourced data to perform a preliminary epidemiologic analysis of pediatric patients with COVID-19

MethodsIn this observational study, data was collected from two open-access, line list crowdsourced online databases. Pediatric cases of COVID-19 were defined as patients [&le;]19 years of age with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis. The primary outcomes were case counts and cumulative case counts. Secondary outcomes included days between symptoms onset and first medical care and days between first medical care and reporting. Tertiary outcomes were rate of travel to Wuhan, rate of infected family members and rates of symptoms.

ResultsA total of 82 patients were included. The median age was 10 [IQR: 5-15] years. Patients from mainland China (outside Hubei) accounted for 46.3% of cases, while the remaining 53.7% of cases were international. Males and females accounted for 52.4% and 32.9% of cases, respectively, with the remaining 14.6% being designated as unknown. A male skew persisted across subgroup analyses by age group (p=1.0) and location (inside/outside China) (p=0.22). While the number of reported international cases has been steadily increasing over the study period, the number of reported cases in China rapidly decreased from the start point. The median reporting delay was 3 [IQR: 2-4.8] days. The median delay between symptom onset and first seeking medical care was 1 [IQR: 0-3.25] day. In international cases, time to first seeking medical care was a median of 2.5 days longer than in China (p=0.04). When clinical features were reported, fever was the most common presentation (68.0%), followed by cough (36.0%).

ConclusionsThe number of reported international pediatric COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing. COVID-19 infections are, to-date, more common in males than females in both the children and adolescent age groups. Additionally, this male predominance remains the case both inside and outside of China. Crowdsourced data enabled early analysis of epidemiologic variables in pediatric patients with COVID-19. Further data sharing is required to enable analyses that are required to understand the course of this infection in children.","Henry, B. M.; Oliveira, M. H.

18052,Combined epidemiological and genomic analysis of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission identifies community social distancing as the dominant intervention reducing outbreaks,"Many healthcare facilities report SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks but transmission analysis is complicated by the high prevalence of infection and limited viral genetic diversity. The contribution of different vectors to nosocomial infection or the effectiveness of interventions is therefore currently unclear. Detailed epidemiological and viral nanopore sequence data were analysed from 574 consecutive patients with a PCR positive SARS-CoV-2 test between March 13th and March 31st, when the pandemic first impacted on a large, multisite healthcare institution in London. During this time the first major preventative interventions were introduced, including progressive community social distancing (CSD) policies leading to mandatory national lockdown, exclusion of hospital visitors, and introduction of universal surgical facemask-use by healthcare-workers (HCW). Incidence of nosocomial cases, community SARS-CoV-2 cases and infection in a cohort of 228 HCWs followed the same dynamic course, decreasing shortly after introduction of CSD measures and prior to the main hospital-based interventions. We investigated clusters involving nosocomial cases based on overlapping ward-stays during the 14-day incubation period and SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence similarity. Our method placed 63 (79%) of 80 sequenced probable and definite nosocomial cases into 14 clusters containing a median of 4 patients (min 2, max 19) No genetic support was found for the majority of epidemiological clusters (31/44, 70%) and genomics revealed multiple contemporaneous outbreaks within single epidemiological clusters. We included a measure of hospital enrichment compared to community cases to increase confidence in our clusters, which were 1-14 fold enriched. Applying genomics, we could provide a robust estimate of the incubation period for nosocomial transmission, with a median lower bound and upper bound of 6 and 9 days respectively. Six (43%) clusters spanned multiple wards, with evidence of cryptic transmission, and community-onset cases could not be identified in more than half the clusters, particularly on the elective hospital site, implicating HCW as vectors of transmission. Taken together these findings suggest that CSD had the dominant impact on reducing nosocomial transmission by reducing HCW infection.","Snell, L. B.; Fisher, C.

We designed a longitudinal study in a hot outbreak zone to analyze the serial findings between infected patients for detecting temporal changes from February 2020. In a hospital-based open-cohort study, patients are followed from admission until one year from their discharge (the 1st, 4th, 12th weeks, and the first year). The measurements included demographic, socio-economics, symptoms, health service diagnosis and treatment, contact history, and psychological variables. The signs improvement, death, length of stay in hospital were considered as primary, and impaired pulmonary function and psychotic disorders were considered as main secondary outcomes. Notably, In the last two follow-ups, each patient attends the hospital to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). Moreover, clinical symptoms and respiratory functions are being determined in such follow-ups. Among the first 600 COVID-19 cases, a total of 490 patients with complete information (39% female; the average age of 57{+/-}15 years) were analyzed. Seven percent of these patients died. The three main leading causes of admission were: fever (77%), dry cough (73%), and fatigue (69%). The most prevalent comorbidities between COVID-19 patients were hypertension (35%), diabetes (28%), and ischemic heart disease (14%). The percentage of primary composite endpoints (PCEP), defined as death, the use of mechanical ventilation, or admission to an intensive care unit was 18%. The following comorbidities were significantly different in the positive and negative PCEP groups: acute kidney disease (p=0.008) and diabetes (p=0.026). For signs and symptoms, fatigue (p=0.020) and sore throat (p=0.001) were significantly different.

20660,Evaluating the Long-Term Efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccines,"AbstractLarge-scale deployment of safe and durably effective vaccines can halt the COVID-19 pandemic.1-3 However, the high vaccine efficacy reported by ongoing phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical trials is based on a median follow-up time of only about two months4-5 and thus does not pertain to long-term efficacy. To evaluate the duration of protection while allowing trial participants timely access to efficacious vaccine, investigators can sequentially cross placebo recipients to the vaccine arm according to priority groups. Here, we show how to estimate potentially time-varying placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy in this type of staggered vaccination of placebo recipients. In addition, we compare the performance of blinded and unblinded crossover designs in estimating long-term vaccine efficacy.

SummaryWe show how to estimate potentially waning long-term efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with staggered enrollment of participants and sequential crossover of placebo recipients.","Lin, D.; Zeng, D.; Gilbert, P.",2021-01-21,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.01.13.21249779,2,Danyu Lin,University of North Carolina,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.13.21249779v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.13.21249779v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
15983,Impact of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in uninfected individuals on COVID-19 mortality in different countries,"Several recent studies identified SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in people without exposure to the virus. However, pathophysiological implications of these findings remain unknown. Here, the potential impact of pre-existing T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in uninfected individuals on markedly different COVID-19 mortality levels in different countries has been investigated. The inverse correlation is documented between the prevalence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in people without exposure to the virus and COVID-19 mortality rates in different countries. In countries with similar levels of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive T cells in uninfected individuals, differences in COVID-19 mortality appear linked with the extend and consistency of implementations of social measures designed to limit the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (lockdown; physical distancing; mask wearing). Collectively, these observations support the model that the level of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells is one of the important determinants of the innate herd immunity against COVID-19. Together with the consistent social measures directed to limit the virus spread, high levels of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells appear significant determinants diminishing the COVID-19 mortality. Observations reported in this contribution should have significant impact on definitions of the herd immunity threshold required to effectively stop the pandemic in different countries across the globe.","Glinsky, G.",2020-10-12,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.03.20206151,2,Gennadi Glinsky,University of California San Diego,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.03.20206151v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.03.20206151v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
12372,Accounting for external factors and early intervention adoption in the design and analysis of stepped-wedge designs: Application to a proposed study design to reduce opioid-related mortality,"BackgroundStepped-wedge designs (SWDs) are currently being used to investigate interventions to reduce opioid overdose deaths in communities located in several states. However, these interventions are competing with external factors such as newly initiated public policies limiting opioid prescriptions, media awareness campaigns, and social distancing orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, control communities may prematurely adopt components of the proposed intervention as they become widely available. These types of events induce confounding of the intervention effect by time. Such confounding is a well-known limitation of SWDs; a common approach to adjusting for it makes use of a mixed effects modeling framework that includes both fixed and random effects for time. However, these models have several shortcomings when multiple confounding factors are present.

MethodsWe discuss the limitations of existing methods based on mixed effects models in the context of proposed SWDs to investigate interventions intended to reduce mortality associated with the opioid epidemic, and propose solutions to accommodate deviations from assumptions that underlie these models. We conduct an extensive simulation study of anticipated data from SWD trials targeting the current opioid epidemic in order to examine the performance of these models under different sources of confounding. We specifically examine the impact of factors external to the study and premature adoption of intervention components.

ResultsWhen only external factors are present, our simulation studies show that commonly used mixed effects models can result in unbiased estimates of the intervention effect, but have inflated Type 1 error and result in under coverage of confidence intervals. These models are severely biased when confounding factors differentially impact intervention and control clusters; premature adoption of intervention components is an example of this scenario. In these scenarios, models that incorporate fixed intervention-by-time interaction terms and an unstructured covariance for the intervention-by-cluster-by-time random effects result in unbiased estimates of the intervention effect, reach nominal confidence interval coverage, and preserve Type 1 error, but may reduce power.

ConclusionsThe incorporation of fixed and random time effects in mixed effects models require certain assumptions about the impact of confounding by time in SWD. Violations of these assumptions can result in severe bias of the intervention effect estimate, under coverage of confidence intervals, and inflated Type 1 error. Since model choice has considerable impact on study power as well as validity of results, careful consideration needs to be given to choosing an appropriate model that takes into account potential confounding factors.","Rennert, L.; Heo, M.; Litwin, A.

11681,SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load is Associated with Increased Disease Severity and Mortality,"The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viral load and risk of disease progression remains largely undefined in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We quantified SARS-CoV-2 viral load from participants with a diverse range of COVID-19 severity, including those requiring hospitalization, outpatients with mild disease, and individuals with resolved infection. SARS-CoV-2 plasma RNA was detected in 27% of hospitalized participants and 13% of outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. Amongst the participants hospitalized with COVID-19, higher prevalence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 plasma viral load was associated with worse respiratory disease severity, lower absolute lymphocyte counts, and increased markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein and IL-6. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, especially plasma viremia, were associated with increased risk of mortality. SARS-CoV-2 viral load may aid in the risk stratification of patients with COVID-19 and its role in disease pathogenesis should be further explored.","Fajnzylber, J.

18217,Association of HLA class I genotypes with age at death of COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundHLA class I molecules play a crucial role in the development of a specific immune response to viral infections by presenting viral peptides to cell surface where they will be further recognized by T cells. In the present manuscript we explored whether HLA class I genotype can be associated with critical course of COVID-19 by searching possible connections between genotypes of deceased patients and their age at death.

Methods and FindingsHLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C genotypes of n = 111 deceased patients with COVID-19 (Moscow, Russia) and n = 428 volunteers were identified with targeted next-generation sequencing. Deceased patients were splitted into two groups according to age at death: n = 26 adult patients with age at death below 60 completed years (inclusively) and n = 85 elderly patients over 60. With the use of HLA class I genotypes we developed a risk score which is associated with the ability to present SARS-CoV-2 peptides by an individuals HLA class I molecule set. The resulting risk score was significantly higher in the group of deceased adults compared to elderly adults (p = 0.00348, AUC ROC = 0.68). In particular, presence of HLA-A*01:01 allele was associated with high risk, while HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*03:01 mainly contributed to the low risk group. The analysis of homozygous patients highlighted the results even stronger: homozygosity by HLA-A*01:01 mainly accompanied early deaths, while only one HLA-A*02:01 homozygote died before 60.

ConclusionsThe obtained results suggest the important role of HLA class I peptide presentation in the development of a specific immune response to COVID-19. While prediction of age at death by HLA class I genotype had a reliable performance, involvement of HLA class II genotype can make it even higher in the future studies.","Shkurnikov, M.; Nersisyan, S.; Jankevic, T.; Galatenko, A.; Gordeev, I.; Vechorko, V.; Tonevitsky, A.",2020-11-22,Genetic And Genomic Medicine,10.1101/2020.11.19.20234567,2,Stepan Nersisyan,HSE University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.19.20234567v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.19.20234567v2.full.pdf,cc_by,NA

5538,"Interim Analysis of Pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Latin America and the Caribbean: Morbidity, Mortality and Molecular Testing Trends in the Region","BackgroundThe relentless advance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic has resulted in a significant burden on countries, regardless of their socio-economic conditions. The virus has infected more than 2.5 million people worldwide, causing to date more than 150,000 deaths in over 210 countries.

ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to describe the trends in cases, tests and deaths related to novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries.

MethodologyData were retrieved from the WHO-Coronavirus Disease (COVID-2019) situation reports and the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) databases from Johns Hopkins University. Descriptive statistics including death rates, cumulative mortality and incidence rates, as well as testing rates per population at risk were performed. A comparison analysis among countries with [&ge;]50 confirmed cases was performed from February 26th, 2020 to April 8th, 2020.

ResultsBrazil had the greatest number of cases and deaths in the region. Panama experienced a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases with Trinidad and Tobago, Bolivia and Honduras having the highest case fatality rates. Panama and Chile conducted more tests per million inhabitants and more tests per day per million inhabitants, followed by Uruguay and El Salvador. Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Ecuador and Brazil had the highest positive test rates.

ConclusionsThe COVID-19 disease pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has progressed rapidly in LAC countries. Some countries have been affected more severely than others, with some adopting similar disease control methods to help slow down the spread of the virus. With limited testing and other resources, social distancing is needed to help alleviate the strain on already stretched health systems.","Simbana-Rivera, K.; Gomez-Barreno, L.; Guerrero, J.; Simbana-Guaycha, F.; Fernandez, R.; Lopez-Cortes, A.; Lister, A.; Ortiz-Prado, E.",2020-04-29,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.04.25.20079863,1,Esteban Ortiz-Prado,"OneHealth Global Research Group, Universidad De Las Americas",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079863v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079863v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
13135,Hospital length of stay for severe COVID-19: implications for Remdesivir's value,"Remdesivir has been granted emergency use authorization for treatment of severe COVID-19. Remdesivir's pricing is based on a presumed reduction of hospital length of stay (LOS) by four days. But the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-1) that suggested this treatment benefit excluded patients who were expected to be discharged within 72 hours. Perhaps as a result, median time to recovery was unusually long in both arms of the study (15 days vs 11 days). Remdesivir requires a 5-day inpatient stay, so patients who would otherwise be discharged in fewer than 5 days may remain hospitalized to complete treatment while patients who would be discharged between 5 and 8 days, would only have potential reductions in their hospital LOS of 0-3 days. In a retrospective analysis of 1643 adults with severe COVID-19 admitted to Columbia University Medical Center and the Allen community hospital between March 9, 2020 and April 23, 2020, median hospital LOS was 7 (3-14) days. Five-hundred and eighty-six patients (36%) had a LOS of 1-4 days, 384 (23%) had a LOS of 5-8 days, and 673 (41%) were hospitalized for greater than or equal to 9 days. Remdesivir treatment may not provide the LOS reductions that the company relied on when pricing the therapy: 36% of the cohort would need to have LOS prolonged to receive a 5-day course, and only 41% of patients in our cohort had LOS of 9 days or more, meaning they could have their LOS shortened by 4 days and still receive a full Remdesivir course. Further investigation of shorter treatment courses and programs to facilitate outpatient intravenous Remdesivir administration are needed.","Anderson, M.; Bach, P.; Baldwin, M.

14074,Modelling COVID-19 contagion: Risk assessment and targeted mitigation policies,"We use a spatial epidemic model with demographic and geographic heterogeneity to study the regional dynamics of COVID-19 across 133 regions in England.

Our model emphasises the role of variability of regional outcomes and heterogeneity across age groups and geographic locations, and provides a framework for assessing the impact of policies targeted towards sub-populations or regions. We define a concept of efficiency for comparative analysis of epidemic control policies and show targeted mitigation policies based on local monitoring to be more efficient than country-level or non-targeted measures. In particular, our results emphasise the importance of shielding vulnerable sub-populations and show that targeted policies based on local monitoring can considerably lower fatality forecasts and, in many cases, prevent the emergence of second waves which may occur under centralised policies.","Cont, R.; Xu, R.; Kotlicki, A.",2020-09-01,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.08.26.20182477,2,Rama Cont,University of Oxford,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.26.20182477v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.26.20182477v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

We explain the assumptions that underlie model-based estimates of the reproduction number and compare them to the assumptions that underlie model-free estimates, such as used in the Robert-Koch Institute situation reports. We highlight effects that originate from the two estimation approaches, and how they may cause differences in the inferred reproduction number. Furthermore, we explore the challenges that originate from data availability - such as publication delays and inconsistent testing - and explain their impact on the time-course of inferred case numbers.

7237,Unequal impact of structural health determinants and comorbidity on COVID-19 severity and lethality in older Mexican adults: Looking beyond chronological aging,"BACKGROUNDCOVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on older adults. Mexicos population is younger, yet COVID-19s impact on older adults is comparable to countries with older population structures. Here, we aim to identify health and structural determinants that increase susceptibility to COVID-19 in older Mexican adults beyond chronological aging.

METHODSWe analyzed confirmed COVID-19 cases in older adults using data from the General Directorate of Epidemiology of Mexican Ministry of Health. We modeled risk factors for increased COVID-19 severity and mortality, using mixed models to incorporate multilevel data concerning healthcare access and marginalization. We also evaluated structural factors and comorbidity profiles compared to chronological age for improving COVID-19 mortality risk prediction.

RESULTSWe analyzed 7,029 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in adults aged [&ge;]60 years. Male sex, smoking, diabetes, and obesity were associated with pneumonia, hospitalization and ICU admission in older adults, CKD and COPD were associated with hospitalization. High social lag indexes and access to private care were predictors of COVID-19 severity and mortality. Age was not a predictor of COVID-19 severity in individuals without comorbidities and structural factors and comorbidities were better predictors of COVID-19 lethality and severity compared to chronological age. COVID-19 baseline lethality hazards were heterogeneously distributed across Mexican municipalities, particularly when comparing urban and rural areas.

CONCLUSIONSStructural factors and comorbidity explain excess risk for COVID-19 severity and mortality over chronological age in older Mexican adults. Clinical decision-making related to COVID-19 should focus away from chronological aging onto more a comprehensive geriatric care approach.","Bello-Chavolla, O.

Early diagnosis and isolation is key to contain the rapid spread of the virus. Towards this goal, we report a simple, sensitive and rapid method to detect the virus using a targeted mass spectrometric approach, which can directly detect the presence of virus from naso-oropharyngeal swabs. Using a multiple reaction monitoring we can detect the presence of two peptides specific to SARS-CoV-2 in a 2.3 minute gradient run with 100% specificity and 90.4 % sensitivity when compared to RT-PCR. Importantly, we further show that these peptides could be detected even in the patients who have recovered from the symptoms and have tested negative for the virus by RT-PCR highlighting the sensitivity of the technique.

Detection platforms that are efficient, rapid, accurate, specific, sensitive, and user friendly are urgently needed to manage and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. RT-qPCR based methods are the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, these methods require trained personnel, sophisticated infrastructure, and a long turnaround time, thereby limiting their usefulness. Reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), a one-step nucleic acid amplification method conducted at a single temperature, has been used for colorimetric virus detection. CRISPR-Cas12 and CRISPR-Cas13 systems, which possess collateral activity against ssDNA and RNA, respectively, have also been harnessed for virus detection. Here, we built an efficient, rapid, specific, sensitive, user-friendly SARS-CoV-2 detection module that combines the robust virus amplification of RT-LAMP with the specific detection ability of SARS-CoV-2 by CRISPR-Cas12. Furthermore, we combined the RT-LAMP-CRISPR-Cas12 module with lateral flow cells to enable highly efficient point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 detection.

16250,Evaluation of saliva sampling procedures for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics reveals differential sensitivity and association with viral load,"Nasopharyngeal sampling has been the preferential collection method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. Alternative sampling procedures that are less invasive and do not require a healthcare professional would be more preferable for patients and health professionals. Saliva collection has been proposed as such a possible alternative sampling procedure. We evaluated the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing on two different saliva collection devices (spitting versus swabbing) compared to nasopharyngeal swabs in over 2500 individuals that were either symptomatic or had high-risk contacts with infected individuals. We observed an overall poor sensitivity in saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection (30.8% and 22.4% for spitting and swabbing, respectively). However, when focusing on individuals with medium to high viral load, sensitivity increased substantially (97.0% and 76.7% for spitting and swabbing, respectively), irrespective of symptomatic status. Our results suggest that saliva cannot readily replace nasopharyngeal sampling for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics but may enable identification of cases with medium to high viral loads.","Mestdagh, P.; Gillard, M.; Arbyn, M.; Pirnay, J.-P.; Poels, J.; Hellemans, J.; Peeters, E.; Hutse, V.; Vermeiren, C.; Boutier, M.; De Wever, V.; Soentjens, P.; Djebara, S.; Malonne, H.; Andre, E.; Smeraglia, J.; Vandesompele, J.",2020-10-13,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.06.20207902,1,Pieter Mestdagh,Ghent University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.06.20207902v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.06.20207902v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
19835,S gene dropout patterns in SARS-CoV-2 tests suggest spread of the H69del/V70del mutation in the US.,"Recently, multiple novel strains of SARS-CoV-2 have been found to share the same deletion of amino acids H69 and V70 in the virus S gene. This includes strain B.1.1.7 / SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01, which has been found to be more infectious than other strains of SARS-CoV-2, and its increasing presence has resulted in new lockdowns in and travel restrictions leaving the UK. Here, we analyze 2 million RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests performed at Helix to identify the rate of S gene dropout, which has been recently shown to occur in tests from individuals infected with strains of SARS-CoV-2 that carry the H69del/V70del mutation. We observe a rise in S gene dropout in the US starting in early October, with 0.25% of our daily SARS-CoV-2-positive tests exhibiting this pattern during the first week. The rate of positive samples with S gene dropout has grown slowly over time, with last week exhibiting the highest level yet, at 0.5%. Focusing on the 14 states for which we have sufficient sample size to assess the frequency of this rare event (n>1000 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples), we see a recent expansion in the Eastern part of the US, concentrated in MA, OH, and FL. However, we cannot say from these data whether the S gene dropout samples we observe here represent the B.1.1.7. strain.

4555,Supportive Care for Patient with Respiratory Diseases: An Umbrella Review,"BackgroundSupportive treatment is an important and effective part of the management for patients with life-threatening diseases. This study aims to identify and evaluate the forms of supportive care for patients with respiratory diseases.

MethodsAn umbrella review of supportive care for patient respiratory diseases was undertaken. We comprehensively searched the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), Wanfang Data and CBM (SinoMed) from their inception to 31 March 2020, and other sources to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses related to supportive treatments for patient with respiratory diseases including COVID-19, SARS, MERS and influenza. We assessed the methodological quality using the AMSTAR score and the quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes of each included systematic review and meta-analysis.

ResultsWe included 18 systematic reviews and meta-analyses in this study. Most studies focused on the respiratory and circulatory support. Ten studies were of high methodological quality, five studies of medium quality, and three studies of low quality. According to four studies extracorporeal membrane oxygenation did not reduce mortality in adults (OR/RR ranging from 0.71 to 1.28), but two studies reported significantly lower mortality in patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation than in the control group (OR/RR ranging from 0.38 to 0.73). Besides, monitoring of vital signs and increasing the number of medical staff may also reduce the mortality in patients with respiratory diseases.

ConclusionsOur overview suggests that supportive care may reduce the mortality of patients with respiratory diseases to some extent. However, the quality of evidence for the primary outcomes in the included studies was low to moderate. Further systematic reviews and meta-analyses are needed to address the evidence gap regarding the supportive care for SARS, MERS and COVID-19.","Luo, X.; Lv, M.; Wang, X.; Long, X.; Ren, M.; Zhang, X.; Liu, Y.; Li, W.; Zhou, Q.; Ma, Y.; Fukuoka, T.; Ahn, H.

5158,No Clear Benefit to the Use of Corticosteroid as Treatment in Adult Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 : A Retrospective Cohort Study,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is becoming an increasing global health issue which has spread across the globe. We aimed to study the effect of corticosteroids in the treatment of adult inpatients with COVID-19.

MethodsA retrospective cohort of 115 consecutive adult COVID-19 patients admitted to The Third Peoples Hospital of Hubei Province between Jan 18, 2020, and Feb 28, 2020 was analysed to study the effectiveness of corticosteroid. They were categorized according to whether or not corticosteroid therapy was given, and compared in terms of demographic characteristics, clinical features, laboratory indicators and clinical outcomes. The primary endpoint was defined as either mortality or intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Known adverse prognostic factors were used as covariates in multiple logistic regressions to adjust for their confounding effects on outcomes.

ResultsAmong 115 patients, 73 patients (63.5%) received corticosteroid. The levels of age, C-reactive protein, D-dimer and albumin were similar in both groups. The corticosteroid group had more adverse outcomes (32.9% vs. 11.9%) and statistically significant differences were observed (p=0.013). In multivariate analysis, corticosteroid treatment was associated with a 2.155-fold increase in risk of either mortality or ICU admission, although not statistically significant.

ConclusionNo evidence suggests that adult patients with COVID-19 will benefit from corticosteroids, and they might be more likely to be harmed with such treatment.","Wang, D.; Wang, J.; Jiang, Q.; Yang, J.; Li, J.; Gao, C.; Jiang, H.; Ge, L.; Liu, Y.",2020-04-24,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.21.20066258,1,Yongming Liu,"The Third Peoples Hospital of Hubei Province, Jianghan University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.21.20066258v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.21.20066258v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
12325,The performance of Mobile Cabin Hospital in combatting COVID-19 in China,"BackgroundSince the end of 2019 to the present day, the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had an immense impact on China and on other countries worldwide. This outbreak represents a serious threat to the lives and health of people all around the world. The epidemic first broke out in Wuhan, where the Chinese government was unable to prevent the spread of the disease by implementing home quarantine measures. Mobile cabin hospitals were used to relieve pressure on hospitals due to the need for beds while also isolating the sources of the infection through a centralized quarantine and treatment of mild cases.

MethodThis paper reviewed and summarized the treatment of patients with mild illness and symptoms during the period from the construction to the closing of the Hanyang Mobile Cabin Hospital in Wuhan, China, and presented the operational elements and possible improvements of running this hospital.

ResultsMobile cabin hospitals helped China to curb the epidemic in only 2 incubation periods in 28 days.The basic conditions required for a normal operation of mobile cabin hospitals included the selection of the environment, medical staff to patient ratio, organizational structure, management model, admission criteria, treatment approaches, discharge process, livelihood guarantee, security, and other safeguarding measures. All of these components were performed carefully in Wuhan Hanyang Mobile Cabin Hospital, without medical staff being infected.

ConclusionThe mobile cabin hospital compulsory quarantine for mild patients was an alternative method to combat COVID-19. It is hoped that the presented work in this manuscript can serve as a reference for the emergency prevention and control measures for global epidemic outbreaks.","Li, H.; Lin, J.; Lian, H.; Chen, K.; Lyu, Y.; Chen, Y.; Ren, L.; Zheng, L.; Lin, Z.; Yu, X.; Chen, Z.; Rensing, C.; Qian, X.; Yang, X.",2020-07-28,Respiratory Medicine,10.1101/2020.07.26.20162206,1,Xin Qian,Shengli Clinical Medical College of Fujian Medical University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.26.20162206v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.26.20162206v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
19843,"Contact Tracing of COVID-19 in Karnataka, India: Superspreading and Determinants of Infectiousness and Symptomaticity","Brief AbstractWe analysed SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and contact tracing data from Karnataka, India up to 21 July 2020. We estimated metrics of infectiousness and the tendency for superspreading (overdispersion), and evaluated potential determinants of infectiousness and symptomaticity in COVID-19 cases. Among 956 cases confirmed to be forward-traced, 8.7% of index cases had 14.4% of contacts but caused 80% of all secondary cases, suggesting significant heterogeneity in individual-level transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 which could not be explained by the degree of heterogeneity in underlying number of contacts. Secondary attack rate was 3.6% among 16715 close contacts. Transmission was higher when index case was aged >18 years, or was symptomatic (adjusted risk ratio, aRR 3.63), or was lab-confirmed [&ge;]4 days after symptom onset (aRR 3.01). Probability of symptomatic infection increased with age, and symptomatic infectors were 8.16 times more likely to generate symptomatic secondaries. This could potentially cause a snowballing effect on infectiousness and clinical severity across transmission generations; further studies are suggested to confirm this. Mean serial interval was 5.4 days. Adding backward contact tracing and targeting control measures to curb super-spreading may be prudent. Due to low symptomaticity and infectivity, interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing transmission.

Structured AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSIndia has experienced the second largest outbreak of COVID-19 globally, yet there is a paucity of studies analysing contact tracing data in the region. Such studies can elucidate essential transmission metrics which can help optimize disease control policies.

MethodsWe analysed contact tracing data collected under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme from Karnataka, India between 9 March and 21 July 2020. We estimated metrics of disease transmission including the reproduction number (R), overdispersion (k), secondary attack rate (SAR), and serial interval. R and k were jointly estimated using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. We evaluated the effect of age and other factors on the risk of transmitting the infection, probability of asymptomatic infection, and mortality due to COVID-19.

FindingsUp to 21 July, we found 111 index cases that crossed the super-spreading threshold of [&ge;]8 secondary cases. R and k were most reliably estimated at R 0.75 (95% CI, 0.62-0.91) and k 0.12 (0.11-0.15) for confirmed traced cases (n=956); and R 0.91 (0.72-1.15) and k 0.22 (0.17-0.27) from the three largest clusters (n=394). Among 956 confirmed traced cases, 8.7% of index cases had 14.4% of contacts but caused 80% of all secondary cases. Among 16715 contacts, overall SAR was 3.6% (3.4-3.9) and symptomatic cases were more infectious than asymptomatic cases (SAR 7.7% vs 2.0%; aRR 3.63 [3.04-4.34]). As compared to infectors aged 19-44 years, children were less infectious (aRR 0.21 [0.07-0.66] for 0-5 years and 0.47 [0.32-0.68] for 6-18 years). Infectors who were confirmed [&ge;]4 days after symptom onset were associated with higher infectiousness (aRR 3.01 [2.11-4.31]). Probability of symptomatic infection increased with age, and symptomatic infectors were 8.16 (3.29-20.24) times more likely to generate symptomatic secondaries. Serial interval had a mean of 5.4 (4.4-6.4) days with a Weibull distribution. Overall case fatality rate was 2.5% (2.4-2.7) which increased with age.

ConclusionWe found significant heterogeneity in the individual-level transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 which could not be explained by the degree of heterogeneity in the underlying number of contacts. To strengthen contact tracing in over-dispersed outbreaks, testing and tracing delays should be minimised, retrospective contact tracing should be considered, and contact tracing performance metrics should be utilised. Targeted measures to reduce potential superspreading events should be implemented. Interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission owing to their low symptomaticity and infectivity. There is some evidence that symptomatic cases produce secondary cases that are more likely to be symptomatic themselves which may potentially cause a snowballing effect on infectiousness and clinical severity across transmission generations; further studies are needed to confirm this finding.

7645,Interim Analysis of Risk Factors for Severe Outcomes among a Cohort of Hospitalized Adults Identified through the U.S. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET),"BackgroundAs of May 15, 2020, the United States has reported the greatest number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and deaths globally.

ObjectiveTo describe risk factors for severe outcomes among adults hospitalized with COVID-19.

DesignCohort study of patients identified through the Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network.

Setting154 acute care hospitals in 74 counties in 13 states.

Patients2491 patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during March 1-May 2, 2020.

MeasurementsAge, sex, race/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions.

ResultsNinety-two percent of patients had [&ge;]1 underlying condition; 32% required intensive care unit (ICU) admission; 19% invasive mechanical ventilation; 15% vasopressors; and 17% died during hospitalization. Independent factors associated with ICU admission included ages 50-64, 65-74, 75-84 and [&ge;]85 years versus 18-39 years (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 1.53, 1.65, 1.84 and 1.43, respectively); male sex (aRR 1.34); obesity (aRR 1.31); immunosuppression (aRR 1.29); and diabetes (aRR 1.13). Independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality included ages 50-64, 65-74, 75-84 and [&ge;]85 years versus 18-39 years (aRR 3.11, 5.77, 7.67 and 10.98, respectively); male sex (aRR 1.30); immunosuppression (aRR 1.39); renal disease (aRR 1.33); chronic lung disease (aRR 1.31); cardiovascular disease (aRR 1.28); neurologic disorders (aRR 1.25); and diabetes (aRR 1.19). Race/ethnicity was not associated with either ICU admission or death.

LimitationData were limited to patients who were discharged or died in-hospital and had complete chart abstractions; patients who were still hospitalized or did not have accessible medical records were excluded.

ConclusionIn-hospital mortality for COVID-19 increased markedly with increasing age. These data help to characterize persons at highest risk for severe COVID-19-associated outcomes and define target groups for prevention and treatment strategies.

13659,"The Effects of Coronavirus Victimization Distress and Coronavirus Racial Bias on Mental Health Among Black, Indigenous and Latinx Young Adults in the United States","BackgroundPeople of color in the U.S. have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of rates of infection and morbidity. Explanations for these disparities include over-representation as essential workers and long-standing inequities in access to health services. Prior to the pandemic, racial discrimination has been associated with depression and general anxiety. However, the effect of discrimination and racial bias specific to the Coronavirus on mental health has not been examined. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of Coronavirus victimization distress and Coronavirus racial bias beliefs on the mental health of young adult people of color.

MethodAn online survey administered to a national sample of 350 Black, Indigenous and Latinx adults (18 - 25 years) included Coronavirus health risks, prescription and financial security, measure of depression and anxiety and 2 new psychometrically validated measures for Coronavirus related victimization distress and racial bias.

ResultsEmployment, number of Coronavirus health risks, Coronavirus victimization distress and Coronavirus racial bias were positively correlated with each other and with depression and anxiety. By contrast, household income and perceived financial and prescription security were negatively correlated with Coronavirus victimization, Coronavirus racial bias and with the mental health indices. Structural equation modeling controlling for demographic variables indicated perceived Coronavirus racial bias mediated the effect of Coronavirus victimization distress on both mental health measures across all groups.

ConclusionsResults suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has created new pathways to mental health disparities among young adults of color by reversing formerly protective factors such as employment, and by exacerbating structural and societal inequities linked to race. Findings highlight the necessity of creating mental health services tailored to the specific needs of racial/ethnic minorities during the current and future health crises.","Fisher, C.

11464,The effect of international travel restrictions on internal spread of COVID-19,"BackgroundCountries have restricted international arrivals to delay the spread of COVID-19. These measures carry a high economic and social cost. They may have little impact on COVID-19 epidemics if there are many more cases resulting from local transmission compared to imported cases.

MethodsTo inform decisions about international travel restrictions, we compared the ratio of expected COVID-19 cases from international travel (assuming no travel restrictions) to the expected COVID-19 cases arising from internal spread on an average day in May 2020 in each country. COVID-19 prevalence and incidence were estimated using a modelling framework that adjusts reported cases for under-ascertainment and asymptomatic infections.

FindingsWith May 2019 travel volumes, imported cases account for <10% of total incidence in 103 (95% credible interval: 76 - 130) out of 142 countries, and <1% in 48 (95% CrI: 9 - 95). If we assume that travel would decrease compared to May 2019 even in the absence of formal restrictions, then imported cases account for <10% of total incidence in 109-123 countries and <1% in 61-88 countries (depending on the assumptions about travel reductions).

InterpretationWhile countries can expect infected travellers to arrive in the absence of travel restrictions, in most countries these imported cases likely contribute little to local COVID-19 epidemics. Stringent travel restrictions may have limited impact on epidemic dynamics except in countries with low COVID-19 incidence and large numbers of arrivals from other countries.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSCountries are at different stages of COVID-19 epidemics, so many have implemented policies to minimise the risk of importing cases via international travel. Such policies include border closures, flight suspensions, quarantine and self-isolation on international arrivals. Searching PubMed and MedRxiv using the search: (""covid"" OR ""coronavirus"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"") AND (""travel"" OR ""restrictions"" OR ""flight"" OR ""flights"" OR ""border"") from 1 January - 10 July 2020 returned 118 and 84 studies respectively, of which 39 were relevant to our study. These studies either concentrated in detail on the risk of importation to specific countries or used a single epidemiological or travel dataset to estimate risk. Most of them focused on the risk of COVID-19 introduction from China or other countries with cases earlier in 2020. No study combined country-specific travel data, prevalence estimates and incidence estimates to assess the global risk of importation relative to current local transmission within countries.

Added value of this studyWe combined data on airline passengers and flight frequencies with estimates of COVID-19 prevalence and incidence (adjusted for underreporting and asymptomatic cases), to estimate the risk of imported cases, relative to the level of local transmission in each country. This allows decision makers to determine where travel restriction policies make large contributions to slowing local transmission, and where they have very little overall effect.

Implications of all the available evidenceIn most countries, imported cases would make a relatively small contribution to local transmission, so travel restrictions would have very little effect on epidemics. Countries where travel restrictions would have a large effect on local transmission are those with strong travel links to countries with high COVID-19 prevalence and/or countries which have successfully managed to control their local outbreaks.","Russell, T.

3653,Acute liver injury and its association with death risk of patients with COVID-19: a hospital-based prospective case-cohort study,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly respiratory infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) with multiple organ injuries. The aim of this study was to analyze SARS-CoV-2-induced acute liver injury (ALI), its association with death risk and prognosis after discharge.

MethodsThree-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients were recruited. Clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. ALI was evaluated and its prognosis was tracked. The association between ALI and death risk was analyzed.

ResultsOf 355 COVID-19 patients, 211 were common, 88 severe, and 51 critical ill cases, respectively. On admission, 223 (62.8%) patients were with hypoproteinemia, 151(42.5%) with cholestasis, and 101 (28.5%) with hepatocellular injury. As expected, ALI was more common in critical ill patients. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and lymphocyte reduction were three important independent risk factors predicting ALI among COVID-19 patients. Death risk analysis shows that fatality rate was higher among patients with hypoproteinemia than those without hypoproteinemia (RR=9.471, P<0.001). Moreover, fatality rate was higher among patients with cholestasis than those without cholestasis (RR=2.182, P<0.05). Follow-up observation found that more than one hepatic functional indexes of two-third patients remained abnormal 14 days after discharge.

ConclusionsALI at early stage elevates death risk of COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI has not recovered completely 14 days after discharge.","Fu, L.; Fei, J.; Xu, S.; Xiang, H.-X.; Xiang, Y.; Tan, Z.-X.; Li, M.-D.; Liu, F.-F.; Li, Y.; Han, M.-F.; Li, X.-Y.; Zhao, H.; Xu, D.-X.",2020-04-06,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.02.20050997,1,De-Xiang Xu,Anhui Medical University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20050997v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20050997v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
6970,Comparative analyses revealed reduced spread of COVID-19 in malaria endemic countries,"In late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infection started in Hubei province of China and now it has spread like a wildfire in almost all parts of the world except some. WHO named the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19 (CoronaVirus Disease-2019). It is very intriguing to see a mild trend of infection in some countries which could be attributed to mitigation efforts, lockdown strategies, health infrastructure, demographics and cultural habits. However, the lower rate of infection and death rates in mostly developing countries, which are not placed at higher levels in terms of healthcare facilities, is a very surprising observation. To address this issue, we hypothesize that this lower rate of infection is majorly been observed in countries which have a higher transmission/prevalence of protozoan parasite borne disease, malaria. We compared the COVID-19 spread and malaria endemicity of 108 countries which have shown at least 200 cases of COVID-19 till 18th April 2020. We found that the number of COVID-19 cases per million population correlates negatively with the malaria endemicity of respective countries. The malaria free countries not only have higher density of COVID-19 infections but also the higher case fatality rates as compared to highly malaria endemic countries. We also postulate that this phenomenon is due to natural immune response against malaria infection, which is providing a heterologous protection against the virus. Unfortunately, there is no licensed vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 yet, but this information will be helpful in design of future strategies against fast spreading COVID-19 disease.","Muneer, A.; Kumari, K.; Tripathi, M.; Srivastava, R.; Mohmmed, A.; Rathore, S.",2020-05-14,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.11.20097923,1,Sumit Rathore,"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, India",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.20097923v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.20097923v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
13463,COVID-19 TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS IN INDIA WITH EXTENDED SEIR MODEL,"India is one of the most harshly affected countries due to COVID epidemic. Early implementation of lockdown protocols were useful to control certain parameters of transmission dynamics, but the numbers are consistently increasing in later months. Indias population is divided into different clusters on the basis of population density and population mobility, even varying resource availability and since the recent cases are coming from throughout the country, it allows us to model an overall average of the country. In this study, we try to prove the efficiency of using the SEIR epidemiological model for different rate study analysis for COVID epidemic in India. Along with it we derived newer components for better forecast of the pandemic in India. We found that there is a decrease in R0 value, but still the epidemic is not under control. The percentage of infected patients being admitted into ICU for critical care is around 9.986%, while the chances of recovery of critical patients being admitted to the ICU seem to be slim at 79.9% of the admitted being dead.","Mali Reddy, B.

9690,Longitudinal immune profiling reveals distinct features of COVID-19 pathogenesis,"BackgroundThe pathogenesis of COVID-19, caused by a novel strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), involves a complex host-virus interaction and is characterised by an exaggerated immune response, the specific components of which are poorly understood. Here we report the outcome of a longitudinal immune profiling study in hospitalised patients during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK and show the relationship between immune responses and severity of the clinical presentation.

MethodsThe Coronavirus Immune Response and Clinical Outcomes (CIRCO) study was conducted at four hospitals in Greater Manchester. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, recruited as close to admission as possible, provided peripheral blood samples at enrolment and sequentially thereafter. Fresh samples were assessed for immune cells and proteins in whole blood and serum. Some samples were also stimulated for 3 hours with LPS and analysed for intracellular proteins. Results were stratified based on patient-level data including severity of symptoms and date of reported symptom onset.

FindingsLongitudinal analysis showed a very high neutrophil to T cell ratio and abnormal activation of monocytes in the blood, which displayed high levels of the cell cycle marker, Ki67 and low COX-2. These properties all reverted in patient with good outcome. Unexpectedly, multiple aspects of inflammation were diminished as patients progressed in severity and time, even in ITU patients not recovering.

InterpretationThis is the first detailed longitudinal analysis of COVID-19 patients of varying severity and outcome, revealing common features and aspects that track with severity. Patients destined for a severe outcome can be identified at admission when still displaying mild-moderate symptoms. We provide clues concerning pathogenesis that should influence clinical trials and therapeutics. Targeting pathways involved in neutrophil and monocyte release from the bone marrow should be tested in patients with COVID-19.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSAnalysis of the literature before the study via pubmed and bioRxiv searches using the terms COVID-19, SARS-CoV2, immune and inflammation (with the last search performed on 27th April 2020) showed evidence of an overactive immune response in a handful of studies in cross-sectional analyses all done at a single time point.

Added value of this studyTo determine the role of the immune response in a disease process, it is necessary to correlate immune activity with clinical parameters dynamically. In this study patients presented to hospital at different stages of disease so we took samples at different time-points to provide an accurate picture of the relevant pathobiology. In order to avoid loss of large components of the immune system due to the processes of storage, longitudinal samples were interrogated in real time to reveal the full immune alterations in COVID-19.

Implications of all the available evidenceRespiratory viruses continue to cause devastating global disease. The finding of altered myelopoiesis, with excess neutrophils and altered monocyte function, as dominant features in our study provides an incentive for clinical testing of therapeutics that specifically target this pathobiology. Given that inflammation is greatest prior to admission to intensive care, trials of specific immune-modulating therapies should be considered earlier in admission.

12804,Impacts of people's learning behavior in fighting the COVID-19 epidemic,"This work presents a mathematical model that captures time-dependent social-distancing effects and presents examples of the consequences of relaxing social-distancing restrictions in the fight against the novel coronavirus epidemic. Without social distancing, the spread of COVID-19 will grow exponentially, but social distancing and peoples learning behavior (isolating, staying at home, wearing face masks, washing hands, restricting the size and frequency of group gatherings, etc.) can significantly impede the epidemic spread, flatten the infection curve, and change the final outcome of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results demonstrate that strict social distancing and peoples learning behavior can be effective in slowing the spread rate and significantly reducing the total number of infections, daily infection rate, peak of daily infections, and duration of the epidemic. Under strict social distancing, the rise and fall of infections would be nearly symmetric about the peak of of daily infections, and the epidemic spread would be essentially over within 60 days. Relaxing social distancing and people learning behaviors will significantly increase the total and daily numbers of infections and prolong the course of the outbreak. These results have immediate applications for the implementation of various social-distancing policies and general significance for ongoing outbreaks and similar infectious disease epidemics in the future (LA-UR 20-22877).

7143,Upper arm length along with mid-upper arm circumference to enhance wasting prevalence estimation and diagnosis : sensitivity and specificity in 6 to 59 month-old children.,"ObjectiveTo evaluate the added value of the use of upper arm length (UAL) along with MUAC (mid-upper arm circumference) to diagnose and estimate the prevalence of wasting in comparison to current WHO standard and others MUAC based methods.

DesignWe included UAL to usual anthropometric measurements during a Mauritanian national 6-59-month-old cross-sectional nutritional survey. Children were classified into 3 groups UALG1, UALG2 and UALG3 according to the following UAL limits: [&le;] 150 mm, 151-180, and > 180mm respectively. We used a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve to determine the best MUAC cut-off for each group with weight-for-height Z score as a reference standard. We compared the wasting prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity, of all diagnostic methods.

FindingsIn total, 12 619 children were included in the study. Wasting prevalence was 16.1%, 5.0% and 12.5% when diagnosed by WHZ < -2, MUAC < 125 mm and MUAC-UALG methods respectively. Using the MUAC-UALG method increased the sensitivity for wasting diagnosis from 17.98 % with MUAC < 125 mm to 39.43% with MUAC-UALG. The specificity decreased from 97.49% with MUAC < 125 to 92.71% with MUAC-UALG. With MUAC-height Z score and MUAC < 138 mm, sensitivity was 26.04% and 69.76%and specificity were 97.40%and 75.64% respectively.

ConclusionThis alternative method using MUAC measuring tape to measure UAL increases the wasting diagnosis accuracy and allows for a better estimation of wasting prevalence. This method could be used as a potential alternative method for quick surveys in emergency settings such as Corona virus disease 2019 context.","Barro, M.; Baro, M.

10554,Superspreading as a Regular Factor of the COVID-19 Pandemic: I. A Two-Component Model,"We consider the impact of superspreading on the course of the COVID-19 epidemic. A two-component model of the epidemic has been developed, in which all infected are divided in two groups. The groups are asymptomatic superspreaders spreading the infection and sensitive persons which can only get infection. Once infected the sensitive exhibit clear symptoms and become isolated. It is shown that the ratio of increment of the number of daily cases in the beginning of the epidemic and decrement at the end of the epidemic is equal to the ratio of the spreading rates of the infection transmission from the superspreaders to potential superspreaders and to the sensitive persons, respectively. On the basis of data from 12 countries and territories it is found that the superspreaders transmit the infection to potential superspreaders approximately 4 times more often then to the sensitive persons. Specific measures to limit the epidemical incidence are proposed. The possibility of an allergic component in the disease is discussed.","Dimaschko, J.",2020-08-27,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.29.20138008,5,Juri Dimaschko,Fachhochschule Luebeck,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.20138008v5?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.20138008v5.full.pdf,cc0_ng,NA
20576,Performance of intensive care unit severity scoring systems across different ethnicities.,"BackgroundDespite wide utilisation of severity scoring systems for case-mix determination and benchmarking in the intensive care unit, the possibility of scoring bias across ethnicities has not been examined. Recent guidelines on the use of illness severity scores to inform triage decisions for allocation of scarce resources such as mechanical ventilation during the current COVID-19 pandemic warrant examination for possible bias in these models. We investigated the performance of three severity scoring systems (APACHE IVa, OASIS, SOFA) across ethnic groups in two large ICU databases in order to identify possible ethnicity-based bias.

MethodData from the eICU Collaborative Research Database and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care were analysed for score performance in Asians, African Americans, Hispanics and Whites after appropriate exclusions. Discrimination and calibration were determined for all three scoring systems in all four groups.

FindingsWhile measurements of discrimination -area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) -were significantly different among the groups, they did not display any discernible systematic patterns of bias. In contrast, measurements of calibration -standardised mortality ratio (SMR) -indicated persistent, and in some cases significant, patterns of difference between Hispanics and African Americans versus Asians and Whites. The differences between African Americans and Whites were consistently statistically significant. While calibrations were imperfect for all groups, the scores consistently demonstrated a pattern of over-predicting mortality for African Americans and Hispanics.

InterpretationThe systematic differences in calibration across ethnic groups suggest that illness severity scores reflect bias in their predictions of mortality.

15699,Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention of COVID-19,"BackgroundRecruitment into randomized trials of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for prevention of COVID-19 has been adversely affected by a widespread conviction that HCQ is not effective for prevention. In the absence of an updated systematic review, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized trials that study the effectiveness of HCQ to prevent COVID-19.

MethodsA search of PubMed and medRxiv with expert consultation found five completed randomized trials: two pre-exposure prophylaxis trials and three post-exposure prophylaxis trials. We obtained or calculated the risk ratio of COVID-19 diagnosis for assignment to HCQ versus no HCQ (either placebo or usual care) for each trial, and then pooled the risk ratio estimates.

ResultsThe estimated risk ratios were 0.74 (95% CI 0.50-1.10), 0.95 (0.25, 3.64) for the pre-exposure prophylaxis trials, and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.58-1.18), 0.68 (95% CI: 0.34-1.34) and 1.10 (95% CI 0.76-1.61) for the post-exposure prophylaxis trials. The pooled risk ratio estimate was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.70-1.06) when using either a fixed effect or a standard random effects approach, and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.65-1.15) when using a conservative modification of the Hartung-Knapp random effects approach. All five trials found a similar rate of serious adverse effects in the HCQ and no HCQ groups.

DiscussionA benefit of HCQ cannot be ruled out based on the 5 completed trials, but the ""not statistically significant"" findings from two early trials were widely interpreted as definite evidence of lack of effectiveness of HCQ for prophylaxis of COVID-19. This interpretation disrupted the timely completion of the remaining trials and thus the generation of precise estimates for pandemic management before the development of vaccines.","Garcia-Albeniz, X.; Del Amo, J.; Polo, R.; Morales Asencio, J.

13111,Effectiveness of booster BCG vaccination in preventing Covid-19 infection,"IntroductionThe evidence that BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) vaccine may increase the ability of the immune system to fight off pathogens other than tuberculosis has been studied in the past. This nonspecific immunity gained our interest, especially after initial reports of less cases in countries with universal BCG vaccination. In hopes of possible protective immunity, all staff of the Emirates International Hospital (United Arab Emirates) were offered a booster BCG vaccine in early March 2020. All the hospital staff were then tested for Covid-19 infection by the end of June 2020.

MethodologyWe divided the subjects into two groups: booster vaccinated, versus unvaccinated. The rate of Covid-19 infection was compared between the groups. Criteria included all staff who were offered the vaccine.

Results71 subjects received the booster vaccination. This group had zero cases of positive COVID 19 infection. 209 subjects did not receive the vaccination, with 18 positive PCR confirmed COVID 19 cases The infection rate in the unvaccinated group was 8.6% versus zero in the booster vaccinated group. (Fishers exact test p-value=0.004).

ConclusionOur findings demonstrated the potential effectiveness of the booster BCG vaccine, specifically the booster in preventing Covid-19 infections in an elevated-risk healthcare population.","Amirlak, I.; Haddad, R.; Hardy, J.

15484,Implications of Monsoon Season & UVB Radiation for COVID-19 in India,"Background: India has recorded 66,333 deaths over 36 administrative regions placing India third in the world after the US and Brazil for COVID-19 deaths as of 2 September 2020. Studies indicate that south-west monsoon season plays a role in the dynamics of contagious diseases, which tend to peak post-monsoon season. Recent studies show that vitamin D and its primary source Ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) may play a protective role in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. However, the combined roles of the monsoon season and UVB in COVID-19 in India are still unclear. In this observational study, we empirically study the respective roles of monsoon season and UVB, whilst further exploring, whether monsoon season negatively impacts the protective role of UVB in COVID-19 deaths in India. Methods: We use a log-linear Mundlak model to a panel dataset of 36 administrative regions in India from 14 March 2020 - 8 August 2020 (n=4005). We use the cumulative COVID-19 deaths as the dependent variable. We isolate the association of monsoon season and UVB as measured by Ultraviolet Index (UVI) from other confounding time-constant and time-varying region-specific factors. Findings: After controlling for various confounding factors, we observe that the monsoon season and a unit increase in UVI are separately associated with 12.8 percentage points and 2.0 percentage points decline in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths in the long run. These associations translate into substantial relative changes. For example, the current monsoon season, that has been going on for two weeks, is associated with a reduction in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths of 59%, whereas a permanent unit increase of UVI is associated with a reduction in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths of 37%. However, the current monsoon season, also reduces the protective role of UVI by 16.3% [0.33 percentage points], plausibly due to lower UVB exposure. Interpretation: We find independent protective roles of both the monsoon season and UVI in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. Furthermore, we find evidence that monsoon season is associated with a significant reduction in the protective role of UVI. The protective role of monsoon season is plausibly due to limited outdoor activities of people. Our study outlines the role of the monsoon season and UVB in COVID-19 in India and supports health-related policy decision making in India.","Kalippurayil Moozhipurath, R.; Kraft, L.",2020-09-25,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.24.20200576,1,Rahul Kalippurayil Moozhipurath,Goethe University Frankfurt am Main,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.24.20200576v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.24.20200576v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
6040,"COVID-19, smoking, and inequalities: a cross-sectional survey of adults in the UK","ObjectivesTo examine associations between smoking and COVID-19 relevant outcomes, taking into account the influence of inequalities and adjusting for potential confounding variables.

DesignOnline cross-sectional survey.

SettingUK.

Participants53,002 men and women aged [&ge;]18y.

Main outcome measuresConfirmed and suspected COVID-19, worry about catching and becoming seriously ill from COVID-19, and adherence to protective behaviours. Socioeconomic position was defined according to highest level of education (post-16 qualifications: yes/no).

ResultsCompared with never smokers (0.3% [95%CI 0.2-0.3%]), prevalence of confirmed COVID-19 was higher among current (0.6% [0.4-0.8%]) but not ex-smokers (0.2% [0.2-0.3%]). The associations were similar before (current: OR 2.14 [1.49-3.08]; ex-smokers: OR 0.73 [0.47-1.14]) and after (current: OR 1.79 [1.22-2.62]; ex-smokers: OR 0.85 [0.54-1.33]) adjustment for potential confounders. For current smokers, this was moderated by socioeconomic position, with higher rates relative to never smokers only seen in those without post-16 qualifications (OR 3.53 [2.04-6.10]). After including suspected cases, prevalence was higher among current smokers (11.2% [10.6-11.9%], OR 1.11 [1.03-1.20]) and ex-smokers (10.9% [10.4-11.5%], OR 1.07 [1.01-1.15]) than never smokers (10.2% [9.9-10.6%]), but remained higher only among ex-smokers after adjustment (OR 1.21 [1.13-1.29]). Current and ex-smokers had higher odds than never smokers of reporting significant stress about catching (current: OR 1.43 [1.35-1.52]; ex-smokers: OR 1.15 [1.09-1.22]) or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 (current: OR 1.34 [1.27-1.43]; ex-smokers: OR 1.22 [1.16-1.28]). Adherence to recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 was generally high (96.3% [96.1-96.4%]), but lower among current than never smokers (OR 0.70 [0.62-0.78]).

ConclusionsWhen assessed by self-report in a population sample, current smoking was independently associated with confirmed COVID-19 infection. There were socioeconomic disparities, with the association only apparent among those without post-16 qualifications. Smokers reported lower adherence to guidelines despite being more worried than non-smokers about catching or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19.

RegistrationThe analysis plan was pre-registered on Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/pcs49/).

What is already known on this topicO_LIFormer or current smoking can increase the risk of respiratory viral and bacterial infections and is associated with worse outcomes for those infected.
C_LIO_LIHowever, data from several countries indicate that rates of current smoking are substantially lower among hospitalised COVID-19 patients than would be expected based on population-level smoking prevalence.

7268,Problems of Deploying CNN Transfer Learning to Detect COVID-19 from Chest X-rays,"The Covid-19 first occurs in Wuhan, China in December 2019. After that the virus spread all around the world and at the time of writing this paper the total number of confirmed cases are above 4.7 million with over 315000 deaths. Machine learning algorithms built on radiography images can be used as a decision support mechanism to aid radiologists to speed up the diagnostic process. The aim of this work is to conduct a critical analysis to investigate the applicability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the purpose of COVID-19 detection in chest X-ray images and highlight the issues of using CNN directly on the whole image. To achieve this task, we first use 12-off-the-shelf CNN architectures in transfer learning mode on 3 publicly available chest X-ray databases together with proposing a shallow CNN architecture in which we train it from scratch. Chest X-ray images fed into CNN models without any preprocessing to follow the many of researches using chest X-rays in this manner. Next, a qualitative investigation performed to inspect the decisions made by CNNs using a technique known as class activation maps (CAM). Using CAMs, one can map the activations contributed most to the decision of CNNs back to the original image to visualize the most discriminating regions on the input image.

We conclude that CNN decisions should not be taken into consideration, despite their high classification accuracy, until clinicians can visually inspect, and approve, the region(s) of the input image used by CNNs that lead to its prediction.","Majeed, T.; Rashid, R.; Ali, D.; Asaad, A.",2020-06-07,Radiology And Imaging,10.1101/2020.05.12.20098954,3,Aras Asaad,Oxford Drug Design,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20098954v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20098954v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
15442,Role of IgG against N-protein of SARS-CoV2 in COVID19 clinical outcomes,"The Nucleocapsid Protein (N Protein) of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is located in the viral core. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) targeting N protein is detectable in the serum of infected patients. The effect of high titers of IgG against N-protein on clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV2 disease has not been described. We studied 400 RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV2 patients to determine independent factors associated with poor outcomes, including MICU admission, prolonged MICU stay and hospital admissions, and in-hospital mortality. We also measured serum IgG against the N protein and correlated its concentrations with clinical outcomes. We found that several factors, including Charlson comorbidity Index (CCI), high levels of IL6, and presentation with dyspnea were associated with poor clinical outcomes. It was shown that higher CCI and higher IL6 levels were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Anti-N protein IgG was detected in the serum of 55 (55%) patients at the time of admission. A high concentration of antibodies, defined as signal to cut off ratio (S/Co)> 1.5 (75 percentile of all measurements), was found in 25 (25%) patients. The multivariable logistic regression models showed that between being an African American, higher CCI, lymphocyte counts, and S/Co ratio> 1.5, only S/Co ratio were independently associated with MICU admission and longer length of stay in hospital. This study recommends that titers of IgG targeting N-protein of SARS-CoV2 at admission is a prognostic factor for the clinical course of disease and should be measured in all patients with SARS-CoV2 infection.","Batra, M.; Tian, R.; Zhang, C.; Clarence, E.; Sacher, C.

16485,Novel Machine-Learned Approach for COVID-19 Resource Allocation: A Tool for EvaluatingCommunity Susceptibility,"Despite worldwide efforts to develop an effective COVID vaccine, it is quite evident that initial supplies will be limited. Therefore, it is important to develop methods that will ensure that the COVID vaccine is allocated to the people who are at major risk until there is a sufficient global supply. Herein, I developed a machine-learning tool that could be applied to assess the risk in communities based on social, medical, and lifestyle risk factors. As a ""proof of concept,"" I modeled COVID risk in the Massachusetts communities using 29 risk factors, including the prevalence of preexisting comorbid conditions like COPD and social factors such as racial composition. Of the 29 factors, 14 were found to be significant (p < 0.1) indicators: poverty, food insecurity, lack of high school education, lack of health insurance coverage, premature mortality, population, population density, recent population growth, Asian percentage, high-occupancy housing, and preexisting prevalence of cancer, COPD, overweightness, and heart attacks. The machine-learning approach finds the 9 highest risk communities in the state of Massachusetts: Lynn, Brockton, Revere, Randolph, Lowell, New Bedford, Everett, Waltham, and Fitchburg. The 5 most at-risk counties are Suffolk, Middlesex, Bristol, Norfolk, and Plymouth. With appropriate data, the tool could evaluate risk in other communities, or even enumerate individual patient susceptibility.

12046,Evidence of integrated health service delivery during COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries: protocol for a scoping review,"IntroductionThe importance of integrated, people-centered health systems has been recognized as a central component of achieving Universal Health Coverage. Integration has also been highlighted as a critical element for building resilient health systems that can stand the shock of health emergencies. However, there is dearth of research and systematic synthesis of evidence on the synergistic relationship between integrated health services and pandemic preparedness in low- and low-middle income countries (LMICs). Thus, the authors are organizing a scoping review aiming to explore application of integrated health service delivery approaches during the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs.

Methods and analysisThis scoping review adheres to the six steps for scoping reviews from Arksey and OMalley (2005). Peer reviewed scientific literature will be systematically assembled utilizing a standardized and replicable search strategy from seven electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, the World Health Organizations Global Research Database on COVID-19, and LitCovid. Initially, the title and abstract of the collected literature, published in English from December 2019 to June 2020, will be screened for inclusion which will be followed by a full text review by two independent reviewers. Data will be charted using a data extraction form and reported in narrative format with accompanying data matrixes.

Ethics and disseminationNo ethical approval is required for the review. The study will be conducted from June to December 2020. Results from this study will provide a snapshot of the evidence currently being generated related to integrated health service delivery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings will be developed into reports and a peer-reviewed articles and will assist policy makers in making pragmatic and evidence-based decisions for current and future pandemic response.

We show that a deep-learning model trained with an external image data set can be used to extract image features and improve the classification accuracy of a data set that does not contain enough image data to train a deep-learning model. We also conducted clinical feature importance analysis and identified the most important clinical features for ER patient classification. This model can be upgraded to include a SARS-CoV-2 specific classification with COVID-19 patients data. The current model is publicly available with an interface at the web link: http://nbttranslationalresearch.org/.

Data statementThe clinical data and chest x-ray image data for this study were collected and prepared by the residents and researchers of the Joint Translational Research Lab of Arkansas State University (A-State) and St. Bernards Medical Center (SBMC) Internal Medicine Residency Program. As data collection is on-going for the project stage-II of clinical testing, raw data is not currently available for data sharing to the public.

7818,Conditions for a second wave of COVID-19 due to interactions between disease dynamics and social processes,"In May 2020, many jurisdictions around the world began lifting physical distancing restrictions against the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), giving rise to concerns about a possible second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These restrictions were imposed as a collective population response to the presence of COVID-19 in communities. However, lifting restrictions is also a population response to their socio-economic impacts, and is expected to increase COVID-19 cases, in turn. This suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic exemplifies a coupled behaviour-disease system. Here we develop a minimal mathematical model of the interaction between social support for school and workplace closure and the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We find that a second wave of COVID-19 occurs across a broad range of plausible model input parameters, on account of instabilities generated by behaviour-disease interactions. We conclude that second waves of COVID-19-should they materialize-can be interpreted as the outcomes of nonlinear interactions between disease dynamics and population behaviour.","Pedro, S.

18806,COVID-19 as cause of viral sepsis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"ImportanceCOVID-19 is a heterogenous disease most frequently causing respiratory tract infection but in its severe forms, respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome may occur, resembling sepsis. The prevalence of viral sepsis among COVID-19 patients is still unclear.

ObjectiveWe aimed to describe this in a systematic review.

Data sourcesMEDLINE(PubMed), Cochrane and Google Scholar databases were searched for studies reporting on patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19, diagnosed with sepsis or infection-related organ dysfunctions or receiving organ replacement therapy.

Study selectionEligible were full-text English articles of randomized and non-randomized clinical trials and observational studies reporting on patients with confirmed COVID-19, who are diagnosed with sepsis or have infection-related organ dysfunctions. Systematic reviews, editorials, conference abstracts, animal studies, case reports, articles neither in English nor full-text, and studies with fewer than 30 participants were excluded.

Data extraction and synthesisAll eligible studies were included in a narrative synthesis of results and after reviewing all included studies a meta-analysis was conducted. Separate sensitivity analyses were conducted per adult vs pediatric populations and per Intensive Care Unit (ICU) vs non-ICU populations.

Main outcomes and measuresPrimary endpoint was the prevalence of sepsis using Sepsis-3 criteria among patients with COVID-19 and among secondary, new onset of infection-related organ dysfunction. Outcomes were expressed as proportions with respective 95% confidence interval (CI).

ResultsOf 1,903 articles, 104 were analyzed. The prevalence of sepsis in COVID-19 was 39.9% (95% CI, 35.9-44.1; I2, 99%). In sensitivity analysis, sepsis was present in 25.1% (95% CI, 21.8-28.9; I2 99%) of adult patients hospitalized in non-Intensive-Care-Unit (ICU) wards (40 studies) and in 83.8 (95% CI, 78.1-88.2; I2,91%) of adult patients hospitalized in the ICU (31 studies). Sepsis in children hospitalized with COVID-19 was as high as 7.8% (95% CI, 0.4-64.9; I2, 97%). Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome was the most common organ dysfunction in adult patients in non-ICU (27.6; 95% CI, 21.6-34.5; I2, 99%) and ICU (88.3%; 95% CI, 79.7-93.5; I2, 97%)

Conclusions and relevanceDespite the high heterogeneity in reported results, sepsis frequently complicates COVID-19 among hospitalized patients and is significantly higher among those in the ICU. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020202018. No funding.

13484,Data-Driven Development of a Small-Area COVID-19 Vulnerability Index for the United States,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to surge in the United States, it has become clear that infection risk is higher in certain populations, particularly socially and economically marginalized groups. Social risk factors, together with other demographic and community characteristics, may reveal local variations and inequities in COVID risk that could be useful for targeting testing and interventions. Yet to date, rates of infection and estimations of COVID risk are typically reported at the county and state level. In this study we develop a small area vulnerability index based on publicly-available sociodemographic data and 668,428 COVID diagnoses reported in 4,803 ZIP codes in the United States (15% of all ZIP codes). The outcome was COVID-19 diagnosis rates per 100,000 people by ZIP code. Explanatory variables included sociodemographic characteristics obtained from the 2018 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. Bayesian multivariable techniques were used to capture complexities of spatial data and spatial autocorrelation and identify individual risk factors and derive their respective weights in the index. COVID-19 diagnosis rates varied from zero to 29,508 per 100,000 people. The final vulnerability index showed that higher population density, higher percentage of noninsured, nonwhite race and Hispanic ethnicity were positively associated with COVID-19 diagnosis rates. Our findings indicate disproportionate risk of COVID-19 infection among some populations and validate and expand understanding of these inequities, integrating several risk factors into a summary index reflecting composite vulnerability to infection. This index can provide local public health and other agencies with evidence-based metrics of COVID risk at a geographical scale that has not been previously available to most US communities.","Amram, O.; Amiri, S.; Thorn, E.

20274,Exploration of interethnic variation in the ibuprofen metabolizing enzyme CYP2C9: a cautionary guide for treatment of COVID-19 symptoms,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a rapidly spreading infectious illness that causes a debilitating respiratory syndrome. Supportive therapy remains the standard for mild-to-moderate cases, including treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) e.g. ibuprofen, however such medications may increase COVID-19 complications when used in patients with acute viral respiratory infections. P450 enzyme CYP2C9 are known to be involved in the metabolism of NSAIDs, however, their pharmacogenetic data are limited. This study aims to better understand the genetic landscape of CYP2C9 sequence variation across different ethnic and geographic groups, in correlation with ibuprofen dosing guidelines. A cohort of 101 Jordanian Arab samples were retrospectively recruited and genotyped using Affymetrix DMET Plus Premier Package. This study identified 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CYP2C9 in these Jordanian Arabs, within the context of over 100,000 global subjects in 417 published reports. Genetic structure analysis across populations revealed that Jordanian Arabs share the closest CYP2C9 sequence homology to Near East and European populations. However, European populations are 7.2x more likely to show impaired ibuprofen metabolism than Sub-Saharan populations, and 4.5x more likely than East Asian ancestry populations.. This is the most comprehensive and up-to-date analysis for CYP2C9 allele frequencies across multi-ethnic populations world-wide. The use of modern genomic tools coupled with a proactive assessment of the most likely gene-drug candidates will lead to a better understanding of the role of pharmacogenetics for COVID-19 and more effective treatments.","Almarzooq, A.

17993,Assessment of functional capacity with cardiopulmonary exercise testing in non-severe COVID-19 patients at three months follow-up,"IntroductionLong-term effects of Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and their sustainability in a large number of patients are of the utmost relevance. We aimed to determine: 1)functional capacity of non-severe COVID-19 survivors by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET); 2)those characteristics associated with worse CPET performance.

MethodsWe prospectively enrolled the first 150 consecutive subjects with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection discharged alive from March to April 2020 at Azienda Sanitaria Locale (ASL)3, Genoa, Italy. At 3-month from hospital discharge, complete clinical evaluation, trans-thoracic echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), pulmonary function test (PFT), and dominant leg extension (DLE) maximal strength evaluation were performed.

ResultsExcluding severe and incomplete/missing cases, 110 patients were analyzed. Median percent predicted peak oxygen uptake (%pVO2) was 90.9(79.2-109.0)%. Thirty-eight(34.5%) patients had %pVO2 below, whereas 72(65.5%) above the 85% predicted value (indicating normality). Median PFT parameters were within normal limits.

Eight(21.1%) patients had a mainly respiratory, 9(23.7%) a mainly cardiac, 3(7.9%) a mixed-cardiopulmonary, and 18(47.4%) a non-cardiopulmonary limitation of exercise. Eighty-one(73.6%) patients experimented at least one symptom, without relationship with %pVO2 (p>0.05).

Multivariate linear regression analysis showed age ({beta}=0.46, p=0.020), percent weight loss ({beta}=-0.77, p=0.029), active smoke status ({beta}=-7.07, p=0.019), length of hospital stay ({beta}=-0.20, p=0.042), and DLE maximal strength ({beta}=1.65, p=0.039) independently associated with %pVO2.

ConclusionsHalf of non-severe COVID-19 survivors show functional capacity limitation mainly explained by muscular impairment, albeit cardiopulmonary causes are possible. These findings call for future research to identify patients at higher risk of long-term effects, that may benefit from careful surveillance and targeted rehabilitation.

7507,COVID-19: Spatial Analysis of Hospital Case-Fatality Rate in France,"When the population risk factors and reporting systems are similar, the assessment of the case-fatality (or lethality) rate (ratio of cases to deaths) represents a perfect tool for analyzing, understanding and improving the overall efficiency of the health system.

The objective of this article is to estimate the influence of the hospital care system on lethality in metropolitan France during the inception of the COVID-19 epidemic, by analyzing the spatial variability of the hospital case-fatality rate between French districts.

The results show that the higher case-fatality rates observed in certain districts are mostly related to the level of morbidity in the district, therefore to the overwhelming of the healthcare systems during the acute phases of the epidemic. However, the magnitude of this increase of case-fatality rate represents less than 10 per cent of the average case-fatality rate and cannot explain the magnitude of the variations in case-fatality rate reported by country by international organizations or information sites. These differences can only be explained by the systems for reporting cases and deaths, which, indeed, vary greatly from country to country, and not attributed to the care or treatment of patients, even during hospital stress due to epidemic peaks.","Souris, M.; Gonzalez, J.-P.",2020-05-26,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.16.20104026,2,Marc Souris,Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.16.20104026v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.16.20104026v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

2535,Generalized logistic growth modeling of the COVID-19 outbreak in 29 provinces in China and in the rest of the world,"Backgroundthe COVID-19 has been successfully contained in China but is spreading all over the world. We use phenomenological models to dissect the development of the epidemics in China and the impact of the drastic control measures both at the aggregate level and within each province. We use the experience from China to analyze the calibration results on Japan, South Korea, Iran, Italy and Europe, and make future scenario projections.

Methodswe calibrate the logistic growth model, the generalized logistic growth model, the generalized growth model and the generalized Richards model to the reported number of infected cases from Jan. 19 to March 10 for the whole of China, 29 provinces in China, four severely affected countries and Europe as a whole. The different models provide upper and lower bounds of our scenario predictions.

ResultsWe quantitatively document four phases of the outbreak in China with a detailed analysis on the heterogenous situations across provinces. Based on Chinese experience, we identify a high risk in Japan with estimated total confirmed cases as of March 25 being 1574 (95% CI: [880, 2372]), and 5669 (95% CI: [988, 11340]) by June. For South Korea, we expect the number of infected cases to approach the ceiling, 7928 (95% CI: [6341, 9754]), in 20 days. We estimate 0.15% (95% CI: [0.03%, 0.30%]) of Italian population to be infected in a positive scenario. We would expect 114867 people infected in Europe in 10 days, in a negative but probable scenario, corresponding to 0.015% European population.

ConclusionsThe extreme containment measures implemented by China were very effective with some instructive variations across provinces. For other countries, it is almost inevitable to see the continuation of the outbreak in the coming months. Japan and Italy are in serious situations with no short-term end to the outbreak to be expected. There is a significant risk concerning the upcoming July 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Irans situation is highly uncertain with unclear and negative future scenarios, while South Korea is approaching the end of the outbreak. Both Europe and the USA are at early stages of the outbreak, posing significant health and economic risks to the world in absence of serious measures.","Wu, K.; Darcet, D.; Wang, Q.; Sornette, D.",2020-03-16,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.11.20034363,1,Didier Sornette,ETH Zurich,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20034363v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20034363v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1007/s11071-020-05862-6

It also examines municipal-level factors associated with cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths to understand the spatial determinants of the pandemic. The analysis of the geographic pattern of the pandemic via Space-Time Scan Statistics (SaTScan) revealed fast spread among municipalities. During Phase I, clusters of infections and deaths were mainly located at the center of the country, while in Phase II, these clusters dispersed to the rest of the country. The regression results from the Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Regression analysis suggested that income inequality, prevalence of obesity and diabetes, and concentration of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) are strongly positively associated to confirmed cases and deaths regardless of lockdown.","Benita, F.; Gasca-Sanchez, F.",2020-12-24,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.12.22.20248716,1,Francisco Benita,Singapore University of Technology and Dedsing,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.22.20248716v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.22.20248716v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

Then, the high-risk terms found to be significant were controlled for in an association study between 41 social determinants and COVID-19 mortality rates. The results describe that ethnic minorities, immigrants, socioeconomic inequalities, and early exposure to COVID-19 are associated with increased COVID-19 mortality, while the prevalence of asthma, suicide, and excessive drinking is associated with decreased mortality. Overall, we recognize that social inequality places disadvantaged groups at risk, which must be addressed through future policies and programs.

7278,Reducing visible aerosol generation during phacoemulsification in the era of Covid-19,"ObjectiveTo assess potential methods of reducing visible aerosol generation during clear corneal phacoemulsification surgery in the era of Covid-19.

MethodsAerosol generation during phacoemulsification was assessed using a model comprising a human cadaveric corneoscleral rim mounted on an artificial anterior chamber. Typical phacoemulsification settings were used and visible aerosol production was recorded using high speed 4K camera. Aerosolisation was evaluated under various experimental settings: Two different phacoemulsification tip sizes (2.2mm, 2.75mm), varying levels of corneal moisture, the use of suction and blowing air in the surgical field, the use of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) coating of the cornea with a static and moving tip.

ResultsThis model demonstrates visible aerosol generation during phacoemulsification with a 2.75mm phacoemulsification tip. No visible aerosol was noted with a 2.2mm tip. The presence of visible aerosol is unrelated to corneal wetting. Suction in close proximity to the aerosol plume did not impact on its dispersion. Blowing air redirected the aerosol plume towards the ocular surface. Visible aerosol production was abolished when HPMC was used to coat the cornea. This effect lasted for an average of 67{+/-}8 seconds in the static model. Visible aerosol generation was discerned during movement of the 2.2mm tip towards the corneal wound.

ConclusionsWe demonstrate visible aerosol production in the setting of a model of a clear cornea phacoemulsification. Visible aerosol can be reduced using a 2.2mm phacoemulsification tip and reapplying HPMC every minute during phacoemulsification.","Darcy, K.; Elhaddad, O.; Achiron, A.; Keller, J.; Leadbetter, D.; Tole, D.; Liyanage, S.

We estimate that such improvement would avert 24,000 to 36,000 premature deaths from air pollution on a monthly basis.","He, G.; Pan, Y.; Tanaka, T.",2020-04-21,Health Economics,10.1101/2020.03.29.20046649,2,Guojun He,"Division of Social Science, Division of Environment and Sustainability, and Department of Economics, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.20046649v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.20046649v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1038/s41893-020-0581-y
7477,Data-driven analysis on the simulations of the spread of COVID-19 under different interventions of China,"Since February 2020, COVID-19 has spread rapidly to more than 200 countries in the world. During the pandemic, local governments in China have implemented different interventions to efficiently control the spread of the epidemic. Characterizing transmission of COVID-19 under some typical interventions is essential to help countries develop appropriate interventions. Based on the pre-symptomatic transmission patterns of COVID-19, we established a novel compartmental model: Baysian SIHR model with latent Markov structure, which treated the numbers of infected and infectious individuals without isolation to be the latent variables and allowed the effective reproduction number to change over time, thus the effects of policies could be reasonably estimated. By using the epidemic data of Wuhan, Wenzhou and Shenzhen, we migrated the corresponding estimated policy modes to South Korea, Italy, and the United States and simulated the potential outcomes for these countries when they adopted similar policy strategies of three cities in China. We found that the mild interventions implemented in Shenzhen were effective to control the epidemic in the early stage, while more stringent policies which were issued in Wuhan and Wenzhou were necessary if the epidemic was more severe and needed to be controlled in a short time.","Tian, T.; Zhang, J.; Lin, S.; Jiang, Y.; Tan, J.; Li, Z.; Wang, X.",2020-07-01,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.05.15.20103051,3,Xueqin Wang,University of Science and Technology of China,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.15.20103051v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.15.20103051v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
11127,Ultrametric model for covid-19 dynamics: an attempt to explain slow approaching herd immunity in Sweden,"We present a mathematical model of infection dynamics that might explain slower approaching the herd immunity during the covid-19 epidemy in Sweden than it was predicted by a variety of other models; see graphs Fig. 2. The new model takes into account the hierarchic structure of social clusters in the human society. We apply the well developed theory of random walk on the energy landscapes represented mathematically with ultrametric spaces. This theory was created for applications to spin glasses and protein dynamics. To move from one social cluster (valley) to another, the virus (its carrier) should cross a social barrier between them. The magnitude of a barrier depends on the number of social hierarchys levels composing this barrier. As the most appropriate for the recent situation in Sweden, we consider linearly increasing (with respect to hierarchys levels) barriers. This structure of barriers matches with a rather soft regulations imposed in Sweden in March 2020. In this model, the infection spreads rather easily inside a social cluster (say working collective), but jumps to other clusters are constrained by social barriers. This models feature matches with the real situation during the covid-19 epidemy, with its cluster spreading structure. Clusters need not be determined solely geographically, they are based on a number of hierarchically ordered social coordinates. The model differs crucially from the standard mathematical models of spread of disease, such as the SIR-model. In particular, our model describes such a specialty of spread of covid-19 virus as the presence of ""super-spreaders"" who by performing a kind of random walk on a hierarchic landscape of social clusters spreads infection. In future, this model will be completed by adding the SIR-type counterpart. But, the latter is not a specialty of covid-19 spreading.

9953,"Seroprevalence and epidemiological characteristics of immunoglobulin M and G antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic people in Wuhan, China","ObjectivesPopulation screening for IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2 was initiated on March 25 and was open to all residents of Wuhan who were symptom-free. All ages with no fever, headache or other symptoms of COVID-19 among residents in Wuhan were included.

MethodsThis study adopted a cross-sectional study. Pearson Chi-square test, T-test, and Mann-Whitney test were used in comparison between different groups. To correct the effects of gender and age, the seroprevalence of IgM positivity, IgG positivity, and IgM and/or IgG positivity were standardized according to the gender and age-specific population of Wuhan in 2017.

ResultsThe seroprevalence of IgG and IgM standardized for age and gender in Wuhan showed a downward trend. No significant correlation was observed between the seroprevalence of IgG and the different age groups. The seroprevalence was significantly higher for females than males (x2 =35.702, p < 0.001), with an odds ratio of 1.36 (95% CI: 1.24-1.48). A significant difference was seen in the seroprevalence of IgG among people from different geographic areas and different types of workplaces (respectively, x2 = 42.871, p < 0.001 and x2 = 202.43, p < 0.001). The IgG antibody-positive cases had a greater number of abnormalities in CT imaging than IgG-negative cases (30.7% vs 19.7%).

ConclusionsOur work found the reported number of confirmed patients in Wuhan only represents a small proportion of the total number of infections. There was a significant aggregation of asymptomatic infections in individuals from some occupations, and based on CT and laboratory findings, some damage may have occurred in asymptomatic individuals positive for IgG antibody.

O_LSTStrengths and limitations of this studyC_LSTO_LIThis study has the important feature of having been designed as repeated five-day serosurveys, which allowed for the monitoring of seroprevalence progression.
C_LIO_LIThis study applied scientific statistical methods accounting for the demographic structure of the general population and imperfect diagnostic tests to estimate seroprevalence in the overall population.
C_LIO_LIThis study had selection bias since the analyzed medical records were based on examinees directed by their work units.

5824,Inflammatory markers in Covid-19 Patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"IntroductionDiagnosis of COVID-19 is based on clinical manifestation, history of exposure, positive findings on chest CT and laboratory tests. It has been shown that inflammation plays a role in pathogenesis of COVID-19.

MethodWe used the necessary transformations to convert the median and IQR to mean and SD Random-effect model using Der Simonian, and Laird methods was used if heterogeneity between studies was significant, the homogeneity among studies was assessed with I2 Statistic, values above 50%, and for the chi-square test, P-values <0.1 was supposed statistically significant

ResultsTwelve studies were included in the analysis that all of which were conducted in China in the year 2020. The result of combining 12 articles with 772 participants showed that the pooled estimate of the mean of lymphocyte with 95% CI was (Mean: 1.01; 95% CI (0.76-1.26); p-value<0.001). About WBC the pooled result of 9 studies with 402 participants was (Mean: 5.11; 95% CI (3.90-6.32); p-value<0.001) Also the pooled mean estimate of 9 studies with 513 patients for the ratio of Neutrophil/lymphocyte was (Mean: 3.62; 95% CI (1.48-5.77); p-value=0.001). The pooled mean from the combination of 7 studies with 521 patients on CRP was (Mean: 28.75; 95% CI (8.04-49.46).

3087,Systematic review and critical appraisal of prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 infection,"ObjectiveTo review and critically appraise published and preprint reports of models that aim to predict either (i) presence of existing COVID-19 infection, (ii) future complications in individuals already diagnosed with COVID-19, or (iii) models to identify individuals at high risk for COVID-19 in the general population.

DesignRapid systematic review and critical appraisal of prediction models for diagnosis or prognosis of COVID-19 infection.

Data sourcesPubMed, EMBASE via Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv and bioRxiv until 24th March 2020.

Study selectionStudies that developed or validated a multivariable COVID-19 related prediction model. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full text.

Data extractionData from included studies were extracted independently by at least two authors based on the CHARMS checklist, and risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST. Data were extracted on various domains including the participants, predictors, outcomes, data analysis, and prediction model performance.

Results2696 titles were screened. Of these, 27 studies describing 31 prediction models were included for data extraction and critical appraisal. We identified three models to predict hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as a proxy for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 18 diagnostic models to detect COVID-19 infection in symptomatic individuals (13 of which were machine learning utilising computed tomography (CT) results); and ten prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to a severe state, or length of hospital stay. Only one of these studies used data on COVID-19 cases outside of China. Most reported predictors of presence of COVID-19 in suspected patients included age, body temperature, and signs and symptoms. Most reported predictors of severe prognosis in infected patients included age, sex, features derived from CT, C-reactive protein, lactic dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count.

Estimated C-index estimates for the prediction models ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in those for the general population (reported for all 3 general population models), from 0.81 to > 0.99 in those for diagnosis (reported for 13 of the 18 diagnostic models), and from 0.85 to 0.98 in those for prognosis (reported for 6 of the 10 prognostic models). All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, and poor statistical analysis, including high risk of model overfitting. Reporting quality varied substantially between studies. A description of the study population and intended use of the models was absent in almost all reports, and calibration of predictions was rarely assessed.

ConclusionCOVID-19 related prediction models are quickly entering the academic literature, to support medical decision making at a time where this is urgently needed. Our review indicates proposed models are poorly reported and at high risk of bias. Thus, their reported performance is likely optimistic and using them to support medical decision making is not advised. We call for immediate sharing of the individual participant data from COVID-19 studies to support collaborative efforts in building more rigorously developed prediction models and validating (evaluating) existing models. The aforementioned predictors identified in multiple included studies could be considered as candidate predictors for new models. We also stress the need to follow methodological guidance when developing and validating prediction models, as unreliable predictions may cause more harm than benefit when used to guide clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD statement to facilitate validating, appraising, advocating and clinically using the reported models.

Summary boxesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABS- The sharp recent increase in COVID-19 infections has put a strain on healthcare systems worldwide, necessitating efficient early detection, diagnosis of patients suspected of the infection and prognostication of COVID-19 confirmed cases.
- Viral nucleic acid testing and chest CT are standard methods for diagnosing COVID-19, but are time-consuming.
- Earlier reports suggest that the elderly, patients with comorbidity (COPD, cardiovascular disease, hypertension), and patients presenting with dyspnoea are vulnerable to more severe morbidity and mortality after COVID-19 infection.


What this study adds- We identified three models to predict hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as a proxy for COVID-19 pneumonia) in the general population.
- We identified 18 diagnostic models for COVID-19 detection in symptomatic patients.
- 13 of these were machine learning models based on CT images.
- We identified ten prognostic models for COVID-19 infected patients, of which six aimed to predict mortality risk in confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, two aimed to predict progression to a severe or critical state, and two aimed to predict a hospital stay of more than 10 days from admission.
- Included studies were poorly reported compromising their subsequent appraisal, and recommendation for use in daily practice. All studies were appraised at high risk of bias, raising concern that the models may be flawed and perform poorly when applied in practice, such that their predictions may be unreliable.","Wynants, L.; Van Calster, B.; Bonten, M.

16136,Assessing the Impact of Area Deprivation Index on COVID-19 Prevalence: A Contrast Between Rural and Urban U.S. Jurisdictions,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted communities differentially, with poorer and minority populations being more adversely affected. Prior rural health research suggests such disparities may be exacerbated during the pandemic and in remote parts of the U.S.

ObjectivesTo understand the spread and impact of COVID-19 across the U.S., county level data for confirmed cases of COVID-19 were examined by Area Deprivation Index (ADI) scores and Metropolitan vs. Nonmetropolitan designations from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). These designations were the basis for making comparisons between Urban and Rural jurisdictions.

MethodsKendalls Tau-B was used to compare effect sizes between jurisdictions on select ADI composites and well researched social determinants of health (SDH). Spearman coefficients and a moderation analysis using Poisson modeling was used to explore the relationship between ADI and COVID-19 prevalence in the context of county designation.

ResultsResults show that the relationship between area deprivation and COVID-19 prevalence was positive and higher for rural counties, when compared to urban ones and that family income and poverty had a stronger relationship with prevalence than other ADI component measures.

ConclusionsThough most Americans live in Metropolitan Areas, rural communities were found to be associated with a stronger relationship between deprivation and COVID-19 prevalence. Models for predicting COVID-19 prevalence by ADI and county type reinforced this observation but revealed no moderating effect of county type on ADI.","Kitchen, C.; Hatef, E.; Chang, H.

13252,Functional SARS-CoV-2-specific immune memory persists after mild COVID-19,"The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus is currently causing a global pandemic and cases continue to rise. The majority of infected individuals experience mildly symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but it is unknown whether this can induce persistent immune memory that might contribute to herd immunity. Thus, we performed a longitudinal assessment of individuals recovered from mildly symptomatic COVID-19 to determine if they develop and sustain immunological memory against the virus. We found that recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody and neutralizing plasma, as well as virus-specific memory B and T cells that not only persisted, but in some cases increased numerically over three months following symptom onset. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes exhibited characteristics associated with potent antiviral immunity: memory T cells secreted IFN-{gamma} and expanded upon antigen re-encounter, while memory B cells expressed receptors capable of neutralizing virus when expressed as antibodies. These findings demonstrate that mild COVID-19 elicits memory lymphocytes that persist and display functional hallmarks associated with antiviral protective immunity.","Rodda, L.

11999,Comparative Evaluation of 19 Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assays for Detection of SARS-CoV-2,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemics. To facilitate the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, various RT-LAMP assays using 19 sets of primers had been developed, but never been compared. We performed comparative evaluation of the 19 sets of primers using 4 RNA standards and 29 clinical samples from COVID-19 patients. Six of 15 sets of primers were firstly identified to have faster amplification when tested with four RNA standards, and were further subjected to parallel comparison with the remaining four primer sets using 29 clinical samples. Among these 10 primer sets, Set-4 had the highest positive detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 (82.8%), followed by Set-10, Set-11, Set-13 and Set-14 (75.9%), and Set-14 showed the fastest amplification speed (< 8.5 minutes), followed by Set-17 (< 12.5 minutes). Based on the overall detection performance, Set-4, Set-10, Set-11, Set-13, Set-14 and Set-17 that target Nsp3, S, S, E, N and N gene regions of SARS-CoV-2, respectively, are determined to be better than the other primer sets. Two RT-LAMP assays with the Set-14 primers in combination with any one of four other primer sets (Set-4, Set-10, Set-11, and Set-13) are recommended to be used in the COVID-19 surveillance.","Dong, Y.; Wu, X.; Li, S.; Lu, R.; Wan, Z.; Qin, J.; Yu, G.; Jin, X.; Zhang, C.",2020-07-24,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.07.22.20159525,1,Chiyu Zhang,Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159525v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159525v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

5416,"TESTING, TRACING AND SOCIAL DISTANCING: ASSESSING OPTIONS FOR THE CONTROL OF COVID_19","In this work we present an analysis of non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented around the world in the fight against COVID-19: Social distancing, shelter-in-place, mask wearing, etc measures to protect the susceptible, together with, in various degrees, testing & contact-tracing to identify, isolate and treat the infected. The majority of countries have relied on the former, while ramping up their testing and tracing capabilities. We consider the examples of South Korea, Italy, Canada and the United States. By fitting a disease transmission model to daily case report data, we show that in each of the four countries their combination of social-distancing and testing/tracing to date have had a significant impact on the evolution of their pandemic curves. In this work we estimate the average isolation rates of infected individuals needing to occur in each country as a result of large-scale testing and contact tracing as a mean of lifting social distancing measures, without a resurgence of COVID-19. We find that an average isolation rate of an infected individual every 4.5 days (South Korea), 5.7 days (Canada) and to 6 days (Italy) would be sufficient. We also find that a rate of under 3.5 days will help in the United States, although it would not completely mitigate the second wave the country is currently under.","Humphrey, L.; Thommes, E.

15941,The Impact of COVID-19 on the Management of Heart Failure -A United Kingdom Patient Questionnaire Study,"AimThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created significant challenges to healthcare globally, necessitating rapid restructuring of service provision. This questionnaire survey was conducted amongst adult heart failure (HF) patients in the United Kingdom (UK), to understand the impact of COVID-19 upon HF services.

Methods and ResultsThe survey was conducted by the Pumping Marvellous Foundation (PMF), a UK HF patient charity. ""Survey Monkey"" was used to disseminate the questionnaire in the PMFs online patient group and in 10 UK hospitals (out-patient hospital and community HF clinics). 1050 responses were collected (693/1050-66% women); 55% (579/1050) were aged over 60 years. Anxiety level was significantly higher regarding COVID19 (mean 7{+/-}2.5 on anxiety scale of 0 to 10) compared to anxiety regarding HF (6.1{+/-}2.4; p<0.001). Anxiety was higher amongst patients aged [&le;]60 years about HF (6.3{+/-}2.2 versus 5.9{+/-}2.5 in those aged >60 years; p=0.005) and COVID-19 (7.3{+/-}2.3 versus 6.7{+/-}2.6 those aged >60 years; p<0.001). 65% respondents (686/1050) reported disruption to HF appointments (cancellation or postponement) during the lockdown period. 37% reported disruption to medication prescription services and 34% reported inability to access their HF teams promptly. 32% expressed reluctance to attend hospital (25% stated they would only attend hospital if there was no alternative and 7% stated that they would not attend hospital at all).

ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant anxiety amongst HF patients regarding COVID-19 and HF. Cancellation or postponement of scheduled clinic appointments, investigations, procedures, prescription and monitoring services were implicated as sources of anxiety.","Sankaranarayanan, R.; Hartshorne-Evans, N.; Redmond-Lyon, S.; Wilson, J.; Essa, H.; Gray, A.; Clayton, L.; Barton, C.; Ahmed, F.

7348,Can we use these masks? Rapid Assessment of the Inhalation Resistance Performance of Uncertified Medical Face Masks in the Context of Restricted Resources Imposed during a Public Health Emergency,"In the case of a public health emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic, access to large quantities of appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) has presented a significant problem. A shortage of face masks and respirators has been widely reported across the world. A concerted effort to manufacture high volumes has not unsurprisingly put pressure on the supply chain and the important certification processes. PPE procured or donated as uncertified stock requires rigorous, expedient and scientifically informed evidence before decisions can be made regarding suitable deployment, expensive certification, return or possible destruction of stock. This paper reports a series of experiments devised in reaction to this situation. In this study, an experimental methodology for the assessment of the filtration performance of samples of real-world, uncertified, fluid resistant surgical masks (FRSM type IIR) was evaluated in the resource limited (lockdown) environment of the COVID-19 pandemic. A steady-state flow rig was adapted to incorporate a bespoke filter flow chamber for mounting face masks in order to evaluate the resistance to air flow as an indicator of mask inhalation performance. Pure air was drawn through a specified control surface area at known flow rate conditions; the resistance to the air flow through the masks was measured as the resulting pressure drop. Over 60 tests were performed from 4 different, randomly sampled batches and compared to a control sample of EN Type IIR certified FRSM masks. Steady-state volumetric airflow rates of 30 and 95 lmin-1 were chosen to represent deep breathing and vigorous exercise conditions respectively. The results showed that the sample masks produced a pressure drop of between 26% to 58% compared to the control batch at the lower flow rate and 22% to 55% at the higher rate. The results for each sample were consistent across both flow rates. Within the group of masks tested, two sets (between 48% and 58% of the reference set) showed the potential to be professionally assessed for appropriate deployment in a suitable setting. Although the absolute values of pressure drop measured by this method are unlikely to correlate with other testing approaches, the observed, indicative trends and relative performance of the masks is key to this approach. Critically, this method does not replace certification but it has enabled a public body to quickly make decisions; certify, re-assign, refund, thus saving time and resources. The total time spent conducting the tests was less than 8 hours and the low cost method proposed can be repurposed for low resource regions.","Begg, S.; Emekwuru, N.

10201,4S-DT: Self Supervised Super Sample Decomposition for Transfer learning with application to COVID-19 detection,"Due to the high availability of large-scale annotated image datasets, knowledge transfer from pre-trained models showed outstanding performance in medical image classification. However, building a robust image classification model for datasets with data irregularity or imbalanced classes can be a very challenging task, especially in the medical imaging domain. In this paper, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network, we called Self Supervised Super Sample Decomposition for Transfer learning (4S-DT) model. 4S-DT encourages a coarse-to-fine transfer learning from large-scale image recognition tasks to a specific chest X-ray image classification task using a generic self-supervised sample decomposition approach. Our main contribution is a novel self-supervised learning mechanism guided by a super sample decomposition of unlabelled chest X-ray images. 4S-DT helps in improving the robustness of knowledge transformation via a downstream learning strategy with a class-decomposition layer to simplify the local structure of the data. 4S-DT can deal with any irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its class boundaries using a downstream class-decomposition mechanism. We used 50,000 unlabelled chest X-ray images to achieve our coarse-to-fine transfer learning with an application to COVID-19 detection, as an exemplar. 4S-DT has achieved an accuracy of 97.54% in the detection of COVID-19 cases on an extended test set enriched by augmented images, out of which all real COVID-19 cases were detected, which was the highest accuracy obtained when compared to other methods.","Abbas, A.; Abdelsamea, M.; Gaber, M.",2020-09-15,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.06.22.20137547,2,Mohammed Abdelsamea,Birmingham City University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.20137547v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.20137547v2.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
18094,COHD-COVID: Columbia Open Health Data for COVID-19 Research,"Massive research efforts have been made in response to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) pandemic. Utilization of clinical data can accelerate these research efforts to fight against the pandemic since important characteristics of the patients are often found by examining the clinical data. To provide shareable clinical data to catalyze COVID-19 research, we present Columbia Open Health Data for COVID-19 Research (COHD-COVID), a publicly accessible database providing clinical concept prevalence, clinical concept co-occurrence, and clinical symptom prevalence for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. COHD-COVID also provides data on hospitalized influenza patients and general hospitalized patients as comparator cohorts. The data used in COHD-COVID were obtained from Columbia University Irving Medical Centers electronic health records. We expect COHD-COVID will provide researchers and clinicians quantitative measures of COVID-19 related clinical features to better understand and fight against the pandemic.","Lee, J.; Kim, J.

15834,Tracing and testing the COVID-19 contact chain: cost-benefit tradeoffs,"Traditional contact tracing for COVID-19 tests the direct contacts of those who test positive even if the contacts do not show any symptom. But, why should the testing stop at direct contacts, and not test secondary, tertiary contacts or even contacts further down? The question arises because by the time an infected individual is tested the infection starting from him may have infected a chain of individuals. One deterrent in testing long chains of individuals right away may be that it substantially increases the testing load, or does it? We investigate the costs and benefits of testing the contact chain of an individual who tests positive. For this investigation, we utilize multiple human contact networks, spanning two real-world data sets of spatio-temporal records of human presence over certain periods of time, as also networks of a classical synthetic variety. Over the diverse set of contact patterns, we discover that testing the contact chain can both substantially reduce over time both the cumulative infection count and the testing load. We consider elements of human behavior that enhance the spread of the disease and lower the efficacy of testing strategies, and show that testing the contact chain enhances the resilience to adverse impacts of these elements. We also discover a phenomenon of diminishing return beyond a threshold value on the depth of the chain to be tested in one go, the threshold then provides the most desirable tradeoff between benefit in terms of reducing the cumulative infection count, enhancing resilience to adverse impacts of human behavior, and cost in terms of increasing the testing load.","Kim, J.; Chen, X.; Bidokhti, S.

8558,ON THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HERD IMMUNITY LEVELS REQUIRED TO STOP COVID-19 EPIDEMICS,"COVID-19 evolved into a pandemic in 2020 affecting more than 150 countries. Given the absence of a vaccine, discussion has taken place on the strategy of allowing the virus to spread in a population, to increase population ""herd immunity"". Knowledge of the minimum proportion of a population required to have recovered from COVID-19 infection in order to attain ""herd"" immunity, Pcrit, is important for formulating epidemiological policy. A method for measuring uncertainty about Pcrit based on a widely used package, EpiEstim, is derived. The procedure is illustrated using data from twelve countries at two early times during the COVID-19 epidemic. It is shown that simple plug-in measures of confidence on estimates of Pcrit are misleading, but that a full characterization of statistical uncertainty can be derived from EpiEstim, which reports percentiles only. Because of the important levels of uncertainty, it is risky to design epidemiological policy based on guidance provided by a single point estimate.","Gianola, D.",2020-06-01,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.31.20118695,1,Daniel Gianola,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.31.20118695v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.31.20118695v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
13635,Absence of relevant QT interval prolongation in not critically ill COVID-19 patients.,"ObjectivesSARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly evolving pandemic causing great morbimortality. Medical therapy with hydroxicloroquine, azitromycin and protease inhibitors is being empirically used, with reported data of QTc interval prolongation. Our aim is to assess QT interval behaviour in a not critically ill and not monitored cohort of patients.

DesignWe evaluated admitted and ambulatory patients with COVID-19 patients with 12 lead electrocardiogram at 48 hours after treatment initiation. Other clinical and analytical variables were collected. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the magnitude of the QT interval prolongation under treatment and to identify clinical, analytical and electrocardiographic risk markers of QT prolongation independent predictors.

ResultsWe included 219 patients (mean age of 63.6 {+/-} 17.4 years, 48.9% were women and 16.4% were outpatients. The median baseline QTc was 416 ms (IQR 404-433), and after treatment QTc was prolonged to 423 ms (405-438) (P < 0.001), with an average increase of 1.8%. Most of the patients presented a normal QTc under treatment, with only 31 cases (14,1 %) showing a QTc interval > 460 ms, and just one case with QTc > 500 ms. Advanced age, longer QTc basal at the basal ECG and lower potassium levels were independent predictors of QTc interval prolongation.

ConclusionsAmbulatory and not critically ill patients with COVID-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and/or antiretrovirals develop a significant, but not relevant, QT interval prolongation.

What is already known about this subject?Treatment for COVID 19 with empirical drugs hydroxicloroquine, azitromycin and protease inhibitors affects ventricular repolarization by prolonging the QT interval in a variable degree basing upon heterogeneous studies

What does this study add?Not critically ill patients with COVID 19 develop a non relevant QT interval prolongation, leading to a modest arrhythmic risk increase, overall in patients with normal basal ECG

How might this impact on clinical practice?Our findings are significant as ECG monitoring of COVID 19 patients is costly and difficult. Ambulatory and stable patients with normal basal ECG might nor benefit from QT assessment afeter treatment initiation","Jaimez, J.

5403,Estimation of the infection fatality rate and the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections,"We introduce a simple methodology to estimate the infection fatality rate (IFR) and from here the total number of infected with SARS-CoV-2. The virus has shown to be highly infectious and thus we based our method under the assumption that all members of a household with at least one confirmed case of COVID-19 should be infected, therefore we estimate the IFR using the number of secondary fatalities in households. The simplicity of the methodology allows for large sample sizes, since it requires minimal laboratory testing capabilities. We applied this methodology to a database of 3,232 confirmed cases in Mexico and arrived to an IFR estimate within the range reported in other studies.","Hernandez-Suarez, C.

17597,Validation of home oxygen saturations as a marker of clinical deterioration in patients with suspected COVID-19,"BackgroundThe early identification of deterioration in suspected COVID-19 patients managed at home enables a more timely clinical intervention, which is likely to translate into improved outcomes. We undertook an analysis of COVID-19 patients conveyed by ambulance to hospital to investigate how oxygen saturation and measurements of other vital signs correlate to patient outcomes, to ascertain if clinical deterioration can be predicted with simple community physiological monitoring.

MethodsA retrospective analysis of routinely collected clinical data relating to patients conveyed to hospital by ambulance was undertaken. We used descriptive statistics and predictive analytics to investigate how vital signs, measured at home by ambulance staff from the South Central Ambulance Service, correlate to patient outcomes. Information on patient comorbidities was obtained by linking the recorded vital sign measurements to the patients electronic health record at the Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. ROC analysis was performed using cross-validation to evaluate, in a retrospective fashion, the efficacy of different variables in predicting patient outcomes.

ResultsWe identified 1,080 adults with a COVID-19 diagnosis who were conveyed by ambulance to either Basingstoke & North Hampshire Hospital or the Royal Hampshire County Hospital (Winchester) between March 1st and July 31st and whose diagnosis was clinically confirmed at hospital discharge. Vital signs measured by ambulance staff at first point of contact in the community correlated with patient short-term mortality or ICU admission. Oxygen saturations were the most predictive of mortality or ICU admission (AUROC 0.772 (95 % CI: 0.712-0.833)), followed by the NEWS2 score (AUROC 0.715 (95 % CI: 0.670-0.760), patient age (AUROC 0.690 (95 % CI: 0.642-0.737)), and respiration rate (AUROC 0.662 (95 % CI: 0.599-0.729)). Combining age with the NEWS2 score (AUROC 0.771 (95 % CI: 0.718-0.824)) or the measured oxygen saturation (AUROC 0.820 (95 % CI: 0.785-0.854)) increased the predictive ability but did not reach significance.

ConclusionsInitial oxygen saturation measurements (on air) for confirmed COVID-19 patients conveyed by ambulance correlated with short-term (30-day) patient mortality or ICU admission, AUROC: 0.772 (95% CI: 0.712-0.833). We found that even small deflections in oxygen saturations of 1-2% below 96% confer an increased mortality risk in those with confirmed COVID at their initial community assessments.","Inada-Kim, M.; Chmiel, F.

15165,RPA-Based Method For The Detection Of SARS-CoV2,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease with significant mortality, morbidity, and far-reaching economic and social disruptions. Testing is key in the fight against COVID-19 disease. The gold standard for COVID-19 testing is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. RT-PCR requires highly specialized, expensive, and advanced bulky equipment that is difficult to use in the field or in a point of care setting. There is need for a simpler, inexpensive, convenient, portable and accurate test. Our aims were to: (i) design primer-probe pairs for use in isothermal amplification of the S1, ORF3 and ORF8 regions of the SARS-CoV2 virus; (ii) optimize the recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay for the isothermal amplification of the named SARS-COV2 regions; (iii) detect amplification products on a lateral flow device. and (ii) perform a pilot field validation of RPA on RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs. Results: Assay validation was done at the National Reference Lab (NRL) at the Rwanda Biomedical Center (RBC) in Rwanda. Results were compared to an established, WHO-approved rRT-PCR laboratory protocol. The assay provides a faster and cheaper alternative to rRT-PCR with 100% sensitivity, 93% specificity, and positive and negative predictive agreements of 100% and 93% respectively. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-field and comparative laboratory validation of RPA for COVID-19 disease in low resource settings. Further standardization will be required for deployment of the RPA assay in field settings. Keywords: Recombinase Polymerase Amplification, COVID-19","Nassir, A. A.; Baptiste, M.

14601,Gastrointestinal involvement attenuates COVID-19 severity and mortality,"Given that gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are a prominent extrapulmonary manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we investigated the impact of GI infection on disease pathogenesis in three large cohorts of patients in the United States and Europe. Unexpectedly, we observed that GI involvement was associated with a significant reduction in disease severity and mortality, with an accompanying reduction in key inflammatory proteins including IL-6, CXCL8, IL-17A and CCL28 in circulation. In a fourth cohort of COVID-19 patients in which GI biopsies were obtained, we identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) within small intestinal enterocytes for the first time in vivo but failed to obtain culturable virus. High dimensional analyses of GI tissues confirmed low levels of cellular inflammation in the GI lamina propria and an active downregulation of key inflammatory genes including IFNG, CXCL8, CXCL2 and IL1B among others. These data draw attention to organ-level heterogeneity in disease pathogenesis and highlight the role of the GI tract in attenuating SARS-CoV-2-associated inflammation with related mortality benefit.","Livanos, A.

6351,Famotidine Use is Associated with Improved Clinical Outcomes in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: A Propensity Score Matched Retrospective Cohort Study,"Background and AimsNo medications are proven to improve clinical outcomes in COVID-19. Famotidine is commonly used for gastric acid suppression but has recently gained attention as an antiviral that may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. This study tested whether famotidine use is associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 initially hospitalized to a non-intensive care setting.

MethodsThis was retrospective cohort study conducted among consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection from February 25 to April 13, 2020 at a single medical center. The primary exposure was famotidine, received within 24 hours of hospital admission. The primary outcome was intubation or death. Propensity score matching was used to balance the baseline characteristics of patients who did and did not use famotidine.

Results1,620 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were identified including 84 (5.1%) who received famotidine within 24 hours of hospital admission. 340 (21%) patients met the study composite outcome of death or intubation. Use of famotidine was associated with reduced risk for death or intubation (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.42, 95% CI 0.21-0.85) and also with reduced risk for death alone (aHR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.80). After balancing baseline patient characteristics using propensity score matching, these relationships were unchanged (HR for famotidine and death or intubation 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.88). Proton pump inhibitors, which also suppress gastric acid, were not associated with reduced risk for death or intubation.

ConclusionFamotidine use is associated with reduced risk of intubation or death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to determine whether famotidine therapy improves outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Freedberg, D. E.; Conigliaro, J.; Sobieszczyk, M.

17623,Changes of Humoral Immunity Response in SARS-CoV-2 Convalescent Patients over 8 months,"Many countries around the world have all seen a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases as the second wave since the beginning of October 2020. Decline of antibodies response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that was reported exclusively in the early month increases the risk of reinfection for convalescent individuals. There is a current need to follow the maintenance of special antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we reported changes of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent patients over 8 months. Antibodies of all 20 participants targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding-domain (RBD) had decreased from a mean OD450 value 1.78 to 0.38 over 8 months. The neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers decreased from the mean ID50 value 836 to 170. The NAb titers were significantly correlated with IgG level during 8 months (P<0.001). Furthermore, while RBD-specific IgG existence of 25% (5/20) convalescent plasma was undetectable, the NAb titers of 15% (3/20) convalescent plasma decreased below the threshold. In addition, compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (S-D614), lower titers of neutralizing antibodies against its G614 variant were shown at 8 months after symptom onset.

Most assessments use local information. Populations differ in Rt, amongst themselves and over time. We use a SIR model for two populations to make the conceptual point that even if each locality averages Rt < 1, the overall epidemic can still grow, provided these populations have asynchronous variation in transmission, and are coupled by movement of infectious individuals. This emergent effect in pandemic dynamics instantiates ""Parrondos Paradox,"" -- an entity comprised of distinct but interacting units can behave qualitatively differently than each part on its own. For effective COVID-19 disease mitigation strategies, it is critical that infectious individuals moving among locations be identified and quarantined. This does not warrant indiscriminate prevention of movement, but rather rational, targeted testing and national coordination.","Kortessis, N.; Simon, M. W.; Barfield, M.; Glass, G.; Singer, B.

Although glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is common among this population, the G6PD status of these cases has not been reported. We report the first case of PMIS related to COVID-19 from Saudi Arabia. This case was a Saudi G6PD deficient girl who died with PMIS related to COVID-19. G6PD deficiency induces redox imbalance and exaggerates the inflammatory response; thus, it might contribute to the development or the grave outcome of our case.

18528,"Time trends in infectious and chronic disease consultations in Dakar, Senegal: Impact of Covid-19 Sanitary Measures","BackgroundThe impact of COVID-19 sanitary measures on the time trends in infectious and chronic disease consultations in Sub-Saharan Africa remains unknown.

MethodsWe conducted a cohort study on all emergency medical consultations over a five-year period, January 2016 to July 2020, from SOS Medecins in Dakar, Senegal. The consultation records provided basic demographic information such as age, ethnicity (Senegalese v. Caucasian), and sex as well as the principal diagnosis using an ICD-10 classification ( infectious,  chronic, and  other). Firstly, we investigated how the pattern in emergency consultation differed from March to July 2020 compared to previous years. Secondly, we examined any potential racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 consultation.

FindingsData on emergency medical consultations were obtained from 53,583 patients of all ethnic origins. The mean age of patients was 37.0 {+/-} 25.2 and 30.3 {+/-} 21.7 in 2016-2019 and 45.5 {+/-} 24.7 and 39{middle dot}5 {+/-} 23.3 in 2020 for Senegalese and Caucasians. The type of consultations between the months of January and July were similar from 2016 and 2019; however, in 2020, there was a drop among the numbers of infectious disease consultations, particularly from April to May 2020 when sanitary measures for COVID-19 were applied (average of 366.5 and 358.25 in 2016-1019 and 133 and 125 in 2020). The prevalence of chronic conditions remained steady during the same period (average of 381 and 394.75 in 2016-2019 and 373 and 367 in 2020). In a multivariate analysis after adjusting to age and sex, infectious disease consultations were significantly more likely to occur in 2016-2019 compared to 2020 (OR for 2016= 2.39, 2017= 2.74, 2018= 2.39, 2019= 2.01). Furthermore, the trend in the number of infectious and chronic consultations were similar among Senegalese and Caucasian groups, indicating no disparities among those seeking treatment.

InterpretationDuring the implementation of COVID-19 sanitary measures, infectious disease rates dropped as chronic disease rates stayed stagnant in Dakar. Furthermore, no racial/ethnic disparities were observed among the infectious and chronic consultations.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow has the application of COVID-19 sanitary measures affected emergency medical consultations from March to July 2020 compared to previous years?

FindingThe rates of infectious diseases decreased as rates of chronic diseases stayed stagnant with the application of sanitary measures. Among the infectious and chronic disease consultations, no racial/ethnic disparities were observed.

MeaningUnderstanding the effects of the sanitary measures against COVID-19 in Sub-Saharan Africa has helped emphasize the possibility of limiting the spread of other infectious diseases in this part of the world where they are still highly prevalent and the efficiency of controlling the spread of the virus while avoiding racial/ethnic disparities.","Gaye, B.; Diop, M.; Khoury, S.; Asselin, A.; Kingue, S.; Nguetta, R.; Diop, I.

8860,Increased serum levels of sCD14 and sCD163 indicate a preponderant role for monocytes in COVID-19 immunopathology,"BackgroundEmerging evidence indicates a potential role for monocyte in COVID-19 immunopathology. We investigated two soluble markers of monocyte activation, sCD14 and sCD163, in covid19 patients with the aim of characterizing their potential role in monocyte-macrophage disease immunopathology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind.

MethodsFifty-nine SARS-Cov-2 positive hospitalized patients, classified according to ICU or non-ICU admission requirement, were prospectively recruited and analyzed by ELISA for levels of sCD14 and sCD163, along with other laboratory parameters, and compared to a healthy control group.

ResultssCD14 and sCD163 levels were significantly higher among COVID-19 patients, independently of ICU admission requirement, compared to the control group. We found a significant correlation between sCD14 levels and other inflammatory markers, particularly Interleukin-6, in the non-ICU patients group. sCD163 showed a moderate positive correlation with the time at sampling from admission, increasing its value over time, independently of severity group.

ConclusionsMonocyte-macrophage activation markers are increased and correlate with other inflammatory markers in SARS-Cov-2 infection, in association to hospital admission. These data suggest a potentially preponderant role for monocyte-macrophage activation in the development of immunopathology of covid19 patients.","Gomez Rial, J.; Curras Tuala, M.

9497,Assessing Relative Coronavirus Disease 2019 Mortality: A Swiss Population-based Study,"ObjectiveSeverity of the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has been assessed in terms of absolute mortality in SARS-CoV-2 positive cohorts. An assessment of mortality relative to mortality in the general population is presented.

DesignRetrospective population-based study.

SettingIndividual information on symptomatic confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients and subsequent deaths from any cause were compared to the all-cause mortality in the Swiss population of 2018. Starting February 23, 2020, mortality in covid-19 patients was monitored for 80 days and compared to the population mortality observed in the same time-of-year starting February 23, 2018.

Participants5 160 595 inhabitants of Switzerland aged 35 to 95 without covid-19 (general population in spring 2018) and 20 769 persons tested positively for covid-19 (spring 2020).

MeasurementsSex- and age-specific mortality rates were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Absolute probabilities of death were predicted and risk was assessed in terms of relative mortality by taking the ratio between the sex- and age-specific absolute mortality in covid-19 patients and the corresponding mortality in the 2018 general population.

ResultsA confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially increased the probability of death across all patient groups, ranging from nine (6 to 15) times the population mortality in 35-year old infected females to a 53-fold increase (46 to 59) for 95 year old infected males. The highest relative risks were observed among males and older patients. The magnitude of these effects was smaller compared to increases observed in absolute mortality risk. Male covid-19 patients exceeded the population hazard for males (hazard ratio 1.20, 1.00 to 1.44). Each additional year of age increased the population hazard in covid-19 patients (hazard ratio 1.04, 1.03 to 1.05).

LimitationsInformation about the distribution of relevant comorbidities was not available on population level and the associated risk was not quantified.

ConclusionsHealth care professionals, decision makers, and societies are provided with an additional population-adjusted assessment of covid-19 mortality risk. In combination with absolute measures of risk, the relative risks presented here help to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the actual impact of covid-19.","Hothorn, T.; Bopp, M.; Guenthard, H.

11687,Use of Powered Air-Purifying Respirator(PAPR) by healthcare workers for preventing highly infectious viral diseases -a systematic review of evidence,"BackgroundHealthcare workers (HCWs) are at particular risk during pandemics and epidemics of highly virulent diseases with significant morbidity and case fatality rate. These diseases include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Ebola. With the current (SARS-CoV-2) global pandemic, it is critical to delineate appropriate contextual respiratory protection for HCWs. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs) as part of respiratory protection versus another device (egN95/FFP2) on HCW infection rates and contamination.

MethodsOur primary outcomes included HCW infection rates with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, Ebola or MERS when utilizing PAPR. We included randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and observational studies. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CENTRAL). Two reviewers independently screened all citations, full-text articles, and abstracted data. Due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity, we did not conduct a meta-analysis. Where applicable, we constructed Evidence Profile (EP) tables for each individual outcome. Confidence in cumulative evidence for each outcome was classified according to the GRADE system.

ResultsWe identified 689 studies during literature searches. We included 10 full text studies. A narrative synthesis was provided. Two on-field studies reported no difference in the rates of healthcare workers performing airway procedures during care of critical patients with SARS-CoV-2. A single simulation trial reported a lower level of cross-contamination of participants using PAPR compared to alternative respiratory protection. There is moderate quality evidence that PAPR use is associated with greater heat tolerance but lower scores for mobility and communication ability. We identified a trend toward greater self-reported wearer comfort with PAPR technology in low quality observational simulation studies.

ConclusionField observational studies do not indicate a difference in healthcare worker infection utilizing PAPR devices versus other compliant respiratory equipment. Greater heat tolerance accompanied by lower scores of mobility and audibility in PAPR were identified. Further pragmatic studies are needed in order to delineate actual effectiveness and provider satisfaction with PAPR technology.

As normal capacity of the Chinese hospitals is exceeded, healthcare professionals struggling to manage this unprecedented crisis face the difficult question of how best to coordinate the medical resources used in highly separated locations. Responding rapidly to this crisis, the National Telemedicine Center of China (NTCC), located in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, has established the Emergency Telemedicine Consultation System (ETCS), a telemedicine-enabled outbreak alert and response network. ETCS is built upon a doctor-to-doctor (D2D) approach, in which health services can be accessed remotely through terminals across hospitals. The system architecture of ETCS comprises three major architectural layers: (1) telemedicine service platform layer, (2) telemedicine cloud layer, and (3) telemedicine service application layer. Our ETCS has demonstrated substantial benefits in terms of the effectiveness of consultations and remote patient monitoring, multidisciplinary care, and prevention education and training.","Zhai, Y.; Wang, Y.; Zhang, M.; Gittell, J.

6477,"More than smell. COVID-19 is associated with severe impairment of smell, taste, and chemesthesis","Recent anecdotal and scientific reports have provided evidence of a link between COVID-19 and chemosensory impairments such as anosmia. However, these reports have downplayed or failed to distinguish potential effects on taste, ignored chemesthesis, generally lacked quantitative measurements, were mostly restricted to data from single countries. Here, we report the development, implementation and initial results of a multi-lingual, international questionnaire to assess self-reported quantity and quality of perception in three distinct chemosensory modalities (smell, taste, and chemesthesis) before and during COVID-19. In the first 11 days after questionnaire launch, 4039 participants (2913 women, 1118 men, 8 other, ages 19-79) reported a COVID-19 diagnosis either via laboratory tests or clinical assessment. Importantly, smell, taste and chemesthetic function were each significantly reduced compared to their status before the disease. Difference scores (maximum possible change {+/-}100) revealed a mean reduction of smell (-79.7 {+/-} 28.7, mean {+/-} SD), taste (-69.0 {+/-} 32.6), and chemesthetic (-37.3 {+/-} 36.2) function during COVID-19. Qualitative changes in olfactory ability (parosmia and phantosmia) were relatively rare and correlated with smell loss. Importantly, perceived nasal obstruction did not account for smell loss. Furthermore, chemosensory impairments were similar between participants in the laboratory test and clinical assessment groups. These results show that COVID-19-associated chemosensory impairment is not limited to smell, but also affects taste and chemesthesis. The multimodal impact of COVID-19 and lack of perceived nasal obstruction suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may disrupt sensory-neural mechanisms.","Parma, V.; Ohla, K.; Veldhuizen, M. G.; Niv, M.

15992,Performance of Existing and Novel Surveillance Case Definitions for COVID-19 in the Community,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), presents with a broad range of symptoms. Existing COVID-19 case definitions were developed from early reports of severely ill, primarily hospitalized, patients. Symptom-based case definitions that guide public health surveillance and individual patient management in the community must be optimized for COVID-19 pandemic control.

MethodsWe collected daily symptom diaries and performed RT-PCR on respiratory specimens over a 14-day period in 185 community members exposed to a household contact with COVID-19 in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Salt Lake City, Utah metropolitan areas. We interpreted the discriminatory performance (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, F1 score, Youdens index, and prevalence estimation) of individual symptoms and common case definitions according to two principal surveillance applications (i.e., individual screening and case counting). We also constructed novel case definitions using an exhaustive search with over 73 million symptom combinations and calculated bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals stratified by children versus adults.

FindingsCommon COVID-19 case definitions generally showed high sensitivity (8696%) but low positive predictive value (PPV) (3649%; F1 score 5263) in this community cohort. The top performing novel symptom combinations included taste or smell dysfunction. They also improved the balance of sensitivity and PPV (F1 score 7880) and reduced the number of false positive symptom screens. Performance indicators were generally lower for children (<18 years of age).

InterpretationExisting COVID-19 case definitions appropriately screened in community members with COVID-19. However, they led to many false positive symptom screens and poorly estimated community prevalence. Absent unlimited, timely testing capacity, more accurate case definitions may help focus public health resources. Novel symptom combinations incorporating taste or smell dysfunction as a primary component better balanced sensitivity and specificity. Case definitions tailored specifically for children versus adults should be further explored.

FundingThis research was wholly supported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence has accelerated globally over the last several months. As the full spectrum of clinical presentations has come into clearer focus, symptom-based clinical screening and case surveillance has also evolved. Preliminary understanding of the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 was driven primarily by descriptions of hospitalized patients, as early testing algorithms prioritized more severely ill persons with classic lower respiratory symptoms and fever. Since then, more data from ambulatory settings have emerged. We searched PubMed from 1 December 2019 to 21 August 2020 for studies that assessed the diagnostic performance of case surveillance definitions for COVID-19. We found no studies examining the discriminatory performance of case surveillance definitions among contacts with mild to moderate symptoms with documented exposure to persons with COVID-19. Nonetheless, we found nine highly relevant studies: seven original reports and two review articles. Five original studies evaluated individual, self-reported symptoms (two among healthcare workers in the United States, one among healthcare workers in the Netherlands, and one online survey for the general public in Somalia) and concluded that using dysfunction of taste or smell for routine COVID-19 screening likely had utility. The fifth study had a similar conclusion based on self-reported symptoms and laboratory results collected via smartphone from the general public in the United States and the United Kingdom. Another original study modeled the substantial effect that multiple revisions to the COVID-19 case definition had on the reported disease burden in the Chinese population. Lastly, an original study illustrated the shift in discriminatory performance of established influenza surveillance case definitions for influenza between adults and children. Age-specific differences in case definition performance may also apply to COVID-19. Two articles reviewed predictive algorithms to define outpatient COVID-19 illness and risk of hospitalization. The reviewed studies were limited in that they were either restricted to individual signs or symptoms, or they incorporated blood tests or imaging that required in-person access to medical care.

Added value of this studyThe discriminatory performance of case surveillance definitions for COVID-19 is important for implementing effective epidemic mitigation strategies. Our study illustrates the performance of case definitions in community members with household exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based solely on symptom profiles. Prior work overrepresented healthcare workers or otherwise studied non-representative populations, and they did not examine across the age spectrum. Our study also provides a novel framework for refining definitions. Using 15 symptoms associated with COVID-19 for all contacts regardless of disease status, we systematically evaluated the discriminatory performance of individual symptoms and previously defined case surveillance definitions across ages and according to two core surveillance applications: 1) screening non-hospitalized individuals to prioritize public health interventions, and 2) estimating the number of non-hospitalized persons with COVID-19 (i.e., community-based syndromic surveillance). We also constructed novel symptom combinations that effectively performed both functions and improved upon widely used case surveillance definitions that may help to target interventions in the absence of unlimited laboratory diagnostic capacity. Our analyses highlight the importance of ongoing re-evaluation of symptom-based surveillance definitions to suit the intended purpose and population under surveillance. Based on our results, which were derived from household members of all ages, case surveillance definition performance may improve if developed separately for adults and children.

Implications of all the available evidenceCase definitions for COVID-19 should be tailored to maximize the discriminatory performance dependent upon its intended use. Existing COVID-19 case definitions screened in most community members with COVID-19, but also yielded a high number of false positive results. When unlimited, timely diagnostic testing is not available symptom combinations with improved accuracy (i.e., more balanced sensitivity and specificity) may help focus resources, such as recommending self-isolation among community contacts.","Reses, H.

15586,The Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Variant to COVID-19 Epidemic in Brazil,"The impact of SARS-CoV-2 dominant global lineages to COVID-19 epidemics is for the first time modeled by an adaptation of the deterministic SEIR Model. Such a strategy may be applied worldwide to predict forecasts of the outbreak in any infected country. The objective of this study is to forecast the outcome of the epidemic in Brazil as a first cohort study case. The basic modeling design takes under consideration two of SARS-CoV-2 dominant strains, and a time-varying reproduction number to forecast the disease transmission behavior. The study is set as a country population-based analysis. Brazilian official published data from February 25 to August 30 2020 was employed to adjust a couple of epidemiological parameters in this cohort study. The population-based sample in this study, 4.2 Million Brazilians during the study period, is the number of confirmed cases on exposed individuals. Model parameters were estimated by minimizing the mean squared quadratic errors. The main outcomes of the study follows: The percentage values of non-symptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 hosts were estimated to be respectively (54 {+/-} 9) % and (46 {+/-} 9) %. By the end of 2020, the number of confirmed cases in Brazil, within 95% CI, is predicted to reach 6 Million (5-7), and fatalities would account for 180.103 (160-200).103. Estimated forecast obtained preserving or releasing the NPIs during the last quarter of 2020, are included. Data points for extra three weeks were added after the model was complete, granting confidence on the outcomes. In 2020 the total number of exposures individuals is estimated to reach 13 {+/-} 1 Million, 6.2% of the Brazilian population. Regarding the original SARS-CoV-2 form and its variant, the only model assumption is their distinct incubation rates. The variant SARS-CoV-2 form, as predicted by the SEIR adopted model, reaches a maximum of 96% of exposed individuals as previously reported for South America. By the end of 2020, a fraction in the range of 15-35 percentages of susceptible Brazilian individuals is to be depleted. Sufficient depletion of susceptibility (by NPIs or not) has to be achieved to weaken the global dynamics spread.","Celaschi, S.",2020-12-10,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.25.20201558,2,Sergio Celaschi,CTI Renato Archer,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.25.20201558v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.25.20201558v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
20162,Comparing the age and sex trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 morbidity with other respiratory pathogens points to potential immune mechanisms.,"Comparing age and sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization and mortality with influenza and other health outcomes opens the way to generating hypotheses as to the underlying mechanisms, building on the extraordinary advances in immunology and physiology that have occurred over the last year. Notable departures in health outcomes starting around puberty suggest that burdens associated with influenza and other causes are reduced relative to the two emergent coronaviruses over much of adult life. Two possible hypotheses could explain this: protective adaptive immunity for influenza and other infections, or greater sensitivity to immunosenescence in the coronaviruses. Comparison of sex differences suggest an important role for adaptive immunity; but immunosenescence might also be relevant, if males experience faster immunosenescence. Involvement of the renin-angiotensin-system in SARS-CoV-2 infection might drive high sensitivity to disruptions of homeostasis. Overall, these results highlight the long tail of vulnerability in the age profile relevant to the emergent coronaviruses, which more transmissible variants have the potential to uncover at the younger end of the scale, and aging populations will expose at the other end of the scale.","Metcalf, C.

6980,Comorbidities and Disparities in Outcomes of COVID-19 Among African American and White Patients,"Initial surveillance data suggests a disproportionately high number of deaths among Black patients with COVID-19. However, high-risk comorbidities are often over-represented in the Black population, and understanding whether the disparity is entirely secondary to them is essential. We performed a retrospective cohort study using real-time analysis of electronic medical records (EMR) of patients from multiple healthcare organizations in the United States. Our results showed that Black patients with COVID-19 have a significantly higher risk of mortality, hospitalization, and invasive mechanical ventilation compared to White patients. The incremental risk of poor outcomes in Blacks persists despite accounting for a higher prevalence of comorbidities. This may point to the disparities in socioeconomic determinants of health affecting Blacks and the need for an improvement in the care of this vulnerable population.","Khan, A.; Chatterjee, A.; Singh, S.",2020-05-15,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.10.20090167,1,Shailendra Singh,"1.

11144,Effectiveness of Ivermectin as add-on Therapy in COVID-19 Management (Pilot Trial),"BackgroundTo date no effective therapy has been demonstrated for COVID-19. In vitro, studies indicated that ivermectin (IVM) has antiviral effect.

ObjectivesTo assess the effectiveness of ivermectin (IVM) as add-on therapy to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZT) in treatment of COVID-19.

MethodsThis Pilot clinical trial conducted on hospitalized adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 diagnosed according to WHO interim guidance. Sixteen Patients received a single dose of IVM 200Mcg /kg on admission day as add on therapy to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)and Azithromycin (AZT) and were compared with 71 controls received HCQ and AZT matched in age, gender, clinical features, and comorbidities.

The primary outcome was percentage of cured patients, defined as symptoms free to be discharged from the hospital and 2 consecutive negative PCR test from nasopharyngeal swabs at least 24 hours apart. The secondary outcomes were time to cure in both groups and evaluated by measuring time from admission of the patient to the hospital till discharge.

ResultsOf 87 patients included in the study,t he mean age {+/-} SD (range) of patients in the IVM group was similar to controls [44.87 {+/-} 10.64 (28-60) vs 45.23 {+/-} 18.47 (8-80) years, p=0.78] Majority of patients in both groups were male but statistically not significant [11(69%) versus 52 (73%), with male: female ratio 2.21 versus 2.7-, p=0.72)

All the patients of IVM group were cured compared with the controls [16 (100 %) vs 69 (97.2 %)]. Two patients died in the controls. The mean time to stay in the hospital was significantly lower in IVM group compared with the controls (7.62 {+/-} 2.75 versus 13.22 {+/-}5.90 days, p=0.00005, effect size= 0.82). No adverse events were observed

ConclusionsAdd-on use of IVM to HCQ and AZT had better effectiveness, shorter hospital stay, and relatively safe compared with controls. however, a larger prospective study with longer follow up may be needed to validate these results.","Gorial, F.

14328,Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Hospital Admissions from COVID-19 and Determining the Impact of Neighborhood Deprivation and Primary Language.,"ImportanceDespite past and ongoing efforts to achieve health equity in the United States, persistent disparities in socioeconomic status along with multilevel racism maintain disparate outcomes and appear to be amplified by COVID-19.

ObjectiveMeasure socioeconomic factors and primary language effects on the risk of COVID-19 severity across and within racial/ethnic groups.

DesignRetrospective cohort study.

SettingHealth records of 12 Midwest hospitals and 60 clinics in the U.S. between March 4, 2020 to August 19, 2020.

ParticipantsPCR+ COVID-19 patients. Patients missing race or ethnicity data or those diagnosed with COVID-19 during a hospitalization were excluded.

ExposuresMain exposures included race/ethnicity, area deprivation index (ADI), and primary language.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was COVID-19 severity using hospitalization within 45 days of diagnosis. Logistic and competing-risk regression models (censored at 45 days and accounting for the competing risk of death prior to hospitalization) assessed the effects of neighborhood-level deprivation (using the ADI) and primary language. Within race effects of ADI and primary language were measured using logistic regression.

Results5,577 COVID-19 patients were included, 866 (n=15.5%) were hospitalized within 45 days of diagnosis. Hospitalized patients were older (60.9 years, IQR: 45.7-75.9 vs. 40.4 years, IQR: 25.6-58.3, p<0.001) and more likely to be male (n=425 [49.1%] vs. 2,049 [43.5%], p=0.002). Of those requiring hospitalization, 43.9% (n=381), 19.9% (n=172), 18.6% (n=161), and 11.8% (n=102) were White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic, respectively.

Independent of ADI, minority race/ethnicity was associated with COVID-19 severity; Hispanic patients (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.72-5.30), Asians (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.74-3.29), and Blacks (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.15-1.94). Surprisingly ADI was not associated with hospitalization; however, consistent trends within racial/ethnic groups were observed. Furthermore, non-English speaking (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.51-2.43) significantly increased odds of hospital admission across and within minority groups.

ConclusionsMinority populations have increased odds of severe COVID-19 independent of neighborhood deprivation, a commonly suspected driver of disparate outcomes during the pandemic. Non-English speaking also accounts for differences across and within minority populations. These results support the continued concern that racism contributes to disparities during COVID-19 while also highlighting the underappreciated role primary language plays in COVID-19 severity across and within minority groups.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes socioeconomic factors or primary language account for racial disparities in COVID-19 disease severity?

FindingsIn this observational study of 5,577 adults, race/ethnicity minorities and non-English as a primary language, independent of neighborhood-level deprivation, are associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease.

MeaningSocioeconomic factors do not account for racial/ethnic disparities related to COVID-19 severity which supports further investigation into the racism and highlights the need to focus on our non-English speaking populations.","Ingraham, N.

4150,Method for Active Pandemic Curve Management (MAPCM),"The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 prompted stringent mitigation measures to ""flatten the curve"" quickly leading to an asphyxiated US economy as a national side effect. There are severe drawbacks to this strategy. The resulting flattened curve remains exponential and always under utilizes available healthcare capacity with a chance of still overburdening it. Moreover, while a mitigation strategy involving isolation and containment can scale down infections, it not only prolongs the outbreak significantly, but also leaves a susceptible population in its wake thats ripe for a secondary outbreak. Since economic activity is inversely proportional to mitigation, curtailing the outbreak with sustained mitigation can stifle the economy severely with disastrous repercussions. Full mitigation for the duration of an outbreak is therefore unsustainable and, overall, a poor solution with potentially catastrophic consequences that couldve been avoided. A new strategy, coined a ""Method for Active Pandemic Curve Management"", or MAPCM, presented herein can shape the outbreak curve in a controlled manner for optimal utilization of healthcare resources during the pandemic, while drastically shortening the outbreak duration compared to mitigation by itself without trading off lives. This method allows mitigation measures to be relaxed gradually from day one, which enables economic activity to resume gradually from the onset of a pandemic. Since outbreak curves (such as hospitalizations) can be programmed using this method, they can also be shaped to accommodate changing needs during the outbreak; and to build herd immunity without the damaging side effects. The method can also be used to ease out of containment. MAPCM is a method and not a model. It is compatible with any appropriate outbreak model; and herein it is illustrated in examples using a hybrid logistic model.","Odendaal, W.

12253,Previous and active tuberculosis increases risk of death and prolongs recovery in patients with COVID-19,"BackgroundThere is growing literature on the association of SARS-CoV-2 and other chronic respiratory conditions, such as COPD and asthma. However, little is known about the relationship between coinfection with tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19. We aimed to compare the risk and survival time of death and recovery among COVID-19 patients with and without TB.

MethodsWe created a 4:1 propensity score matched sample of COVID-19 patients without and with TB, using SARS-CoV-2 surveillance data in the Philippines. We conducted a longitudinal cohort analysis of matched COVID-19 patients as of May 17, 2020, following them until June 15, 2020. The primary analysis estimated the risk ratios of death and recovery comparing COVID-19 patients with and without TB. Kaplan-Meier curves described time-to-death and time-to-recovery stratified by TB status, and differences in survival were assessed using the Wilcoxon test. We also conducted the same analysis on a subsample of admitted COVID-19 patients only.

ResultsThe risk of death in COVID-19 patients with TB was 2.17 times greater compared to those without TB (95% CI: 1.40-3.37). The risk of recovery in TB patients was 25% less than the risk among those without TB (RR=0.75, 0.63-0.91). Similarly, time-to-death among COVID-19 patients with TB was significantly shorter (p=0.0031) and time-to-recovery in TB patients was significantly longer than patients without TB (p=0.0046).

Among those admitted, COVID-19 TB patients also had a similar significant increase in risk of death (RR=2.25, 95% CI: 1.35-3.75); however, the risk of recovery was not significantly less (RR=0.84, 95% CI: 0.68-1.06). Time-to-death among those with TB was also significantly longer (p=0.0031) than those without TB, but there was no difference in time-to-recovery (p=0.17).

ConclusionsOur findings show that coinfection with tuberculosis increases morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Our findings reiterate the need to prioritize routine and testing services for tuberculosis, even with increased disruptions to health systems during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Additional research needs to focus on the interrelationship between TB and COVID-19 for appropriate planning and resource allocation, as SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread worldwide.","Sy, K. T.

11548,Endocrine disrupting chemicals and COVID-19 relationships: a computational systems biology approach,"BackgroundPatients at high risk of severe forms of COVID-19 frequently suffer from chronic diseases, but other risk factors may also play a role. Environmental stressors, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), can contribute to certain chronic diseases and might aggravate the course of COVID-19.

ObjectivesTo explore putative links between EDCs and COVID-19 severity, an integrative systems biology approach was constructed and applied.

MethodsAs a first step, relevant data sets were compiled from major data sources. Biological associations of major EDCs to proteins were extracted from the CompTox database. Associations between proteins and diseases known as important COVID-19 comorbidities were obtained from the GeneCards and DisGeNET databases. Based on these data, we developed a tripartite network (EDCs-proteins-diseases) and used it to identify proteins overlapping between the EDCs and the diseases. Signaling pathways for common proteins were then investigated by over-representation analysis.

ResultsWe found several statistically significant pathways that may be dysregulated by EDCs and that may also be involved in COVID-19 severity. The Th17 and the AGE/RAGE signaling pathways were particularly promising.

ConclusionsPathways were identified as possible targets of EDCs and as contributors to COVID-19 severity, thereby highlighting possible links between exposure to environmental chemicals and disease development. This study also documents the application of computational systems biology methods as a relevant approach to increase the understanding of molecular mechanisms linking EDCs and human diseases, thereby contributing to toxicology prediction.","Wu, Q.; Coumoul, X.; Grandjean, P.; Barouki, R.; Audouze, K.",2020-07-15,Toxicology,10.1101/2020.07.10.20150714,1,Karine Audouze,Universite de Paris,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150714v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150714v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.1016/j.envint.2020.106232

In the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, they offer rapid on-site diagnostics and can relieve centralized laboratory testing sites, thus freeing resources that can be focused on especially vulnerable groups. However, visual interpretation of the POCT test lines is subjective, error prone and only qualitative.

We use a process model based on a compartmental epidemiological framework Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD). Analysis of case data with such a mechanism-based model has advantages over purely phenomenological approaches because the parameters of the SIRD model can be calibrated using prior knowledge.

A description is developed based on the framework of susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed model. Removed population is split into recovered and death populations allowing a better comprehension of real situations. Besides, total population is reduced based on the number of deaths. Hospital infrastructure is also included into the mathematical description allowing the consideration of collapse scenarios. Initially, a model verification is carried out calibrating system parameters with data from China outbreak that is considered a benchmark due the availability of data for the entire cycle. Afterward, numerical simulations are performed to analyze COVID-19 dynamics in Brazil. Results show several scenarios showing the importance of social isolation. System dynamics has a strong sensitivity to transmission rate showing the importance of numerical simulations to guide public health decision strategies.","Pacheco, P. M. C. L.; Savi, M. A.; Savi, P.

17636,The COVID-19 epidemic in the Czech Republic: retrospective analysis of measures (not) implemented during the spring first wave,"The Czech Republic (or Czechia) is facing the second wave of COVID-19 epidemic, with the rate of growth in the number of confirmed cases (among) the highest in Europe. Learning from the spring first wave, when many countries implemented interventions that effectively stopped national economics (i.e., a form of lockdown), political representations are now unwilling to do that again, at least until really necessary. Therefore, it is necessary to look back and assess efficiency of each of the first wave restrictions, so that interventions can now be more finely tuned. We develop an age-structured model of COVID-19 epidemic, distinguish several types of contact, and divide the population into 206 counties. We calibrate the model by sociological and population movement data and use it to analyze the first wave of COVID-19 epidemic in Czechia, through assessing effects of applied restrictions as well as exploring functionality of alternative intervention schemes that were discussed later. To harness various sources of uncertainty in our input data, we apply the Approximate Bayesian Computation framework. We found that (1) personal protective measures as face masks and increased hygiene are more effective than reducing contacts, (2) delaying the lockdown by four days led to twice more confirmed cases, (3) implementing personal protection and effective testing as early as possible is a priority, and (4) tracing and quarantine or just local lockdowns can effectively compensate for any global lockdown if the numbers of confirmed cases not exceedingly high.","Berec, L.; Smycka, J.; Levinsky, R.; Hromadkova, E.; Soltes, M.; Slerka, J.; Tucek, V.; Trnka, J.; Smid, M.; Zajicek, M.; Diviak, T.; Neruda, R.; Vidnerova, P.",2020-11-10,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.11.06.20227330,1,Ludek Berec,"Faculty of Science, University of South Bohemia, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.06.20227330v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.06.20227330v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
14651,The impact of COVID-19 on the lives and mental health of Australian adolescents,"ObjectiveThere has been significant disruption to the lives and mental health of adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the exact nature of the effects is not known. The purpose of this study was to assess the psychological and lifestyle impact of the pandemic on Australian adolescents, using an online survey, administered during and after the peak of the outbreak (June-July 2020).

MethodSelf-report surveys were administered online to a sample of 760 Australian adolescents aged 12-18 years old. Surveys assessed worry about contracting COVID-19, behavioral change in response to the pandemic, impact on education, peer and family relationships, lifestyle factors including exercise, technology use and sleep, as well as mental health outcomes including psychological distress, loneliness, health anxiety and wellbeing.

ResultsOverall, young people expressed significant concern and worry about contracting the virus, and most (>85%) engaged in behaviors to reduce the risk of transmission. Three quarters of the sample reported a worsening of their mental health since the pandemic began, with negative impacts reported by most respondents on learning, friendships and family relationships. More than 40% of young people reported a decrease in exercise and 70% reported an increase in technology use since the outbreak. There were high levels of uncertainty about the future reported by respondents, and their scores on validated measures indicated higher levels of sleep disturbance, psychological distress and health anxiety, and lower levels of wellbeing, relative to normative samples. Reponses on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale indicated that 48.3% of the sample were experiencing distress consistent with a probable mental illness, which is much higher than pre-pandemic prevalence rates. Effects on mental health were worse among those who reported a previous diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety relative to those without a history of depression and/or anxiety.

ConclusionThese results indicate high levels of disruption and psychological distress experienced by adolescents during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescents are already vulnerable to the onset of mental illness at this developmental stage, and the current research underscores the need to find rapid and accessible ways to support adolescent mental health during times of crisis. There is a need for longitudinal research to evaluate the enduring effects of the pandemic on adolescents.","Li, S.; Beames, J.; Newby, J.; Maston, K.; Christensen, H.; Werner-Seidler, A.",2020-09-09,Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology,10.1101/2020.09.07.20190124,1,Aliza Werner-Seidler,"Black Dog Institute, UNSW Sydney",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.07.20190124v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.07.20190124v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
4497,Estimates of regional infectivity of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom following imposition of social distancing measures,"We describe regional variation in the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 infections observed using publicly reported data in the UK, with a view to understanding both if there are clear hot spots in viral spread in the country, or other spatial patterns. Based on case data up to the 9th April, we estimate that the viral replication number remains above 1 overall in the UK but that its trend is to decrease. This suggests the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 patients is imminent. We find that there is significant regional variation in the UK and that this is changing over time. Within England currently the reproductive ratio is lowest in the Midlands (1.11 95% CI 1.07; 1.14), and highest in the North East of England (1.38 95% CI 1.33-1.42). There are long and variable time delays between infection and detection of cases, and thus it remains unclear whether the reduction in the reproductive number is a result of social distancing measures. If we are to prevent further outbreaks, it is critical that we both reduce the time taken for detection and improve our ability to predict the regional spread of outbreaks.","Challen, R.

The study was carried out to assess the present state of knowledge people have about the probable vaccine for COVID-19, to know the preferences of respondents about this vaccine and to learn the expectations and apprehensions of people about features of this prospective COVID-19 vaccine residing in the capital city of India.

MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted amongst the residents of Delhi, India from July-October 2020. Both offline and online interview method was used to collect date from 513 participants representing various occupational strata. Data was collected on socio demographic variable, vaccine acceptance and concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccine.

ResultsAmong the study population 79.5% said they will take the vaccine while 8.8% said they were not going to take the vaccine and remaining 11.7% had not yet decided about it. Most of them(78.8%),believed that vaccine would be available to public next year but at the same time half(50.1%) of them believe that it may not be in sufficient amount for everyone to get. More than 50% were willing to pay for the vaccine and 72% felt vaccine should first be given to health workers and high risk group.

ConclusionThe following study has helped to understand the percentage of people who are hesitant to take the vaccine and also the concerns regarding the vaccine. Also since half of the population is willing to pay for the vaccine, a strategical approach considering the various economical classes of people could be applied in a developing country like India.","Islam, F.; Agarwalla, R.; Panda, M.; Alvi, Y.; Singh, V.; Debroy, A.; Ray, A.; Vadnerkar, A.; Uttekar, S.",2021-01-26,Health Informatics,10.1101/2021.01.23.21250164,1,Yasir Alvi,"Assistant Professor, Department of Community Medicine, Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research ,New Delhi, India",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.23.21250164v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.23.21250164v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
8771,The impact of the undetected COVID-19 cases on its transmission dynamics,"ObjectiveThe COVID-19 pandemic is currently ongoing. Presently, due to the unavailability of a definitive vaccine to decrease its acquiring, its essential to understand its transmissibility in the community by undetected cases to control its transmission. This study aims to study this context using mathematical modelling.

MethodsA COVID-19 transmission model was framed that estimated the basic reproduction number (R0, a measurement of disease risk) using the next-generation method. It explored the contribution of exposed and infected (detected and undetected) individuals, and environmental pathogen to the overall risk of infection spreading, utilizing the publicly reported data of this infection in Maharashtra between March 22, 2020, and May 4, 2020. A sensitivity analysis was performed to study the effect of a rising number of undetected cases to R0.

ResultsThe estimated basic reproduction number is R0 = 4.63, which increases rapidly with the rise in the undetected COVID-19 cases. Although the exposed individuals made the largest contribution to infection transmission (R1 = 2.42), the contaminated environment also played a significant role.

ConclusionsIt is crucial to identify the individuals exposed and infected to COVID-19 disease and isolate them to control its transmission. The awareness of the role of fomites in infection transmission is also important in this regard.","Saha, S.; Saha, S.",2020-06-03,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.30.20117838,1,Sujata Saha,Mankar College,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.30.20117838v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.30.20117838v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
10001,"Belgian Covid-19 Mortality, Excess Deaths, Number of Deaths per Million, and Infection Fatality Rates (8 March - 9 May 2020)","ObjectiveScrutiny of COVID-19 mortality in Belgium over the period 8 March - 9 May 2020 (Weeks 11-19), using number of deaths per million, infection fatality rates, and the relation between COVID-19 mortality and excess death rates.

DataPublicly available COVID-19 mortality (2020); overall mortality (2009 - 2020) data in Belgium and demographic data on the Belgian population; data on the nursing home population; results of repeated sero-prevalence surveys in March-April 2020.

Statistical methodsReweighing, missing-data handling, rate estimation, visualization.

ResultsBelgium has virtually no discrepancy between COVID-19 reported mortality (confirmed and possible cases) and excess mortality. There is a sharp excess death peak over the study period; the total number of excess deaths makes April 2020 the deadliest month of April since WWII, with excess deaths far larger than in early 2017 or 2018, even though influenza-induced January 1951 and February 1960 number of excess deaths were similar in magnitude. Using various sero-prevalence estimates, infection fatality rates (IFRs; fraction of deaths among infected cases) are estimated at 0.38 - 0.73% for males and 0.20 - 0.39% for females in the non-nursing home population (non-NHP), and at 0.79 - 1.52% for males and 0.88 - 1.31% for females in the entire population. Estimates for the NHP range from 38 to 73% for males and over 22 to 37% for females. The IFRs rise from nearly 0% under 45 years, to 4.3% and 13.2% for males in the non-NHP and the general population, respectively, and to 1.5% and 11.1% for females in the non-NHP and general population, respectively.

The IFR and number of deaths per million is strongly influenced by extensive reporting and the fact that 66.0% of the deaths concerned NH residents. At 764 (our re-estimation of the figure 735, presented by ""Our World in Data""), the number of COVID-19 deaths per million led the international ranking on May 9, 2020, but drops to 262 in the non-NHP. The NHP is very specific: age-related increased risk; highly prevalent comorbidities that, while non-fatal in themselves, exacerbate COVID-19; larger collective households that share inadvertent vectors such as caregivers and favor clustered outbreaks; initial lack of protective equipment, etc. High-quality health care countries have a relatively older but also more frail population [1], which is likely to contribute to this result.

Thumbnail summary: What this paper addsCOVID-19 mortality and its relation to excess deaths, case fatality rates (CFRs), infection fatality rates (IFRs), and number of deaths per million are constantly being reported for a large number of countries globally.

This study adds detailed insight in the Belgian situation over the period 8 March - 9 May 2020 (Week 11-Week 19).

Belgium has virtually no discrepancy between COVID-19 reported mortality (confirmed and possible cases) and excess mortality. This, combined with a high fraction of possible cases that is COVID-19 related [2] provides a basis for using all COVID-19 cases and thus not only the confirmed ones, in IFR estimation.

Against each of the years from 2009 and 2019 and the average thereof, there is a strong excess death peak in 2020, which nearly entirely coincides with confirmed plus possible COVID-19 cases. The excess death/COVID-19 peak rises well above seasonal fluctuations seen in the first trimester during the most recent decade (induced in part by seasonal influenza). In the second week of April 2020, twice as many people died than in the corresponding week of the reference year. April 2020 was the deadliest month of April since WWII, although January 1951 and February 1960 saw similar figures. More recently, in the winter of 2017-2018, there was 4.6% excess mortality in Belgium (70,215 actual deaths; 3093 more than the Be-MOMO-model prediction). In the winter of 2016-2017, there was an excess of 3284 deaths (4.9% excess mortality) https://epistat.wiv-isp.be/docs/momo/Be-MOMO%20winter%202017-18%20report_FR.pdf.

At 764 (our estimate), the number of COVID-19 deaths per million leads the international ranking, but drops sharply to 262 in the non-nursing home population.

CFR is not a good basis for international comparison, except as a tool in estimating global infection fatality rates [2]. These authors used asymptotic models to derive IFR as a limit of CFR. CFR is strongly influenced by testing strategy, and in several studies the delay between case confirmation and deaths is not accounted for. The handling of possible cases is ambiguous at best. We do not consider it here.

Bias and precision in estimation of IFR is influenced by difficulties surrounding the estimation of sero-prevalence, such as sensitivity and specificity of the tests used [3], time to IgM and in particular IgG seroconversion [4], and potential selection bias occurring in data from residual sample surveys. A sensitivity analysis is undertaken by augmenting one primary with three auxiliary estimates of sero-prevalence.

Because in Belgium there is a very close agreement between excess mortality on the one hand and confirmed and possible COVID-19 cases combined on the other, and because an international study [2] suggested that a fraction as high as 0.9 of possible cases could be attributable to COVID-19 [5], it is a reasonable choice to use all COVID-19 cases in IFR estimation. This encompasses a large fraction of deaths occurring in nursing homes. The IFR values obtained align with international values [2]. Using various sero-prevalence estimates, IFRs across all ages are estimated at 0.38 - 0.73% for males and 0.20 - 0.39% for females in the non-nursing home population (non-NHP), and at 0.79 - 1.52% for males and 0.88 - 1.31% for females in the entire population. Estimates for the NHP range from 38 to 73% for males and over 22 to 37% for females. The IFRs rise from nearly 0% under 45 years, to 4.3% and 13.2% for males in the non-NHP and the general population, respectively, and to 1.5% and 11.1% for females in the non-NHP and general population, respectively.

The IFR is strongly influenced by extensive death cases reporting and the fact that 66.0% of the deaths concerned NH residents. Apart from a strong age-related gradient, also for each age category, IFRs are substantially higher in males than in females Because of these dependencies, IFRs should be considered in an age, gender, and sub-population specific manner. The same proviso is made for the number of deaths per million.

An important such population is the NHP because of a specific cocktail: age-related increased risk; highly prevalent comorbidities that, while non-fatal in themselves, exacerbate COVID-19; larger collective households that share inadvertent vectors such as caregivers; initial lack of protective equipment, etc. High-quality health care countries have a relatively older but also more frail population [1], which might contribute.","Molenberghs, G.; Faes, C.; Verbeeck, J.; Deboosere, P.; Abrams, S.; Willem, L.; Aerts, J.; Theeten, H.; Devleesschauwer, B.; Bustos Sierra, N.; Renard, F.; Herzog, S.; Lusyne, P.; Van Der Heyden, J.; Van Oyen, H.; Van Damme, P.; Hens, N.",2020-12-08,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.20.20136234,2,Geert Molenberghs,Universiteit Hasselt and KU Leuven,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.20136234v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.20136234v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
5172,Biased and unbiased estimation of the average lengths of stay in intensive care units in the COVID-19 pandemic,"BackgroundThe average length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU_ALOS) is a helpful parameter summarizing critical bed occupancy. During the outbreak of a novel virus, estimating early a reliable ICU_ALOS estimate of infected patients is critical to accurately parameterize models examining mitigation and preparedness scenarios.

MethodsTwo estimation methods of ICU ALOS were compared: the average LOS of already discharged patients at the date of estimation (DPE), and a standard parametric method used for analyzing time-to-event data which fits a given distribution to observed data and includes the censored stays of patients still treated in the ICU at the date of estimation (CPE). Methods were compared on a series of all COVID-19 consecutive cases (n=59) admitted in an ICU devoted to such patients. At the last follow-up date, 99 days after the first admission, all patients but one had been discharged. A simulation study investigated the generalizability of the methods patterns. CPE and DPE estimates were also compared to COVID-19 estimates reported to date.

FindingsLOS [&ge;] 30 days concerned 14 out of the 59 patients (24%), including 8 of the 21 deaths observed. Two months after the first admission, 38 (64%) patients had been discharged, with corresponding DPE and CPE estimates of ICU_ALOS (95%CI) at 13.0 days (10.4-15.6) and 23.1 days (18.1-29.7), respectively. Series true ICU_ALOS was greater than 21 days, well above reported estimates to date.

InterpretationDischarges of short stays are more likely observed earlier during the course of an outbreak. Cautious unbiased ICU_ALOS estimates suggest parameterizing a higher burden of ICU bed occupancy than that adopted to date in COVID-19 forecasting models.

6143,Evaluating efficiency of pooling specimens for PCR-based detection of COVID-19,"In the age of a pandemic, such as the ongoing one caused by SARS-CoV-2, the world faces limited supply of tests, PPE and reagents, and factories are struggling to meet the growing demands. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of pooling specimen for testing of SARS-CoV-2 virus, to determine whether costs and resource savings could be achieved without impacting the sensitivity of the testing. Ten specimens were pooled for testing, containing either one or two known positive specimen of varying viral concentrations. Pooling specimens did not affect the sensitivity of detecting SARS-CoV-2, and the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) between testing of pooling specimen and subsequent individual testing was not significantly different using paired t-test. This study also identified cost savings garnered from pooling of specimen for testing at 4 differing prevalence rates, ranging from 0.1-10%. Pooling specimens to test for COVID-19 infection in low prevalence areas or in low risk population can dramatically decrease the resources burden on lab operations by up to 80%. This paves the possibility for large-scale population screening, allowing for assured policy decisions by governmental bodies to ease lockdown restrictions in areas with low incidence of infection, or with lower risk populations.","Wacharapluesadee, S.; Kaewpom, T.; Ampoot, W.; Ghai, S.; Khamhang, W.; Worachotsueptrakun, K.; Wanthong, P.; Nopvichai, C.; Supharatpariyakorn, T.; Putcharoen, O.; Paitoonpong, L.; Suwanpimolkul, G.; Jantarabenjakul, W.; Hemachudha, P.; Krichphiphat, A.; Buathong, R.; Plipat, T.; Hemachudha, T.",2020-05-06,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.02.20087221,1,Supaporn Wacharapluesadee,"Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Centre, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, K",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.02.20087221v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.02.20087221v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1002/jmv.26005
7593,Performance of six SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays in comparison with microneutralisation,"There is an urgent need for reliable high-throughput serological assays for the management of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Preferably, the performance of serological tests for a novel virus should be determined with clinical specimens against a gold standard, i.e. virus neutralisation.

We evaluated specificity and sensitivity of six commercial immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies, including four automated assays [Abbott SARS-COV-2 IgG (CE marked), Diasorin Liaison(R) SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG (research use only), and Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA (CE marked)], and two rapid lateral flow (immunocromatographic) tests [Acro Biotech 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM (CE marked) and Xiamen Biotime Biotechnology SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM (CE marked)] in comparison with a microneutralisation test (MNT). Two specimen panels from serum samples sent to Helsinki University Hospital Laboratory (HUSLAB) were compiled: the patient panel included sera from PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients, and the negative panel included sera sent for screening of autoimmune diseases and respiratory virus antibodies in 2018 and 2019. The MNT was carried out for all COVID-19 samples (70 serum samples, 62 individuals) and for 53 samples from the negative panel. Forty-one out of 62 COVID-19 patients showed neutralising antibodies with median of 11 days (range 3-51) after onset of symptoms.

The specificity and sensitivity values of the commercial tests against MNT, respectively, were as follows: 95.1%/80.5% (Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG), 94.9%/43.8% (Diasorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 IgG), 68.3%/87.8% (Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgA), 86.6%/70.7% (Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG), 74.4%/56.1% (Acro 2019-nCoV IgG), 69.5%/46.3% (Acro 2019-nCoV IgM), 97.5%/71.9% (Xiamen Biotime SARS-CoV-2 IgG), and 88.8%/81.3% (Xiamen Biotime SARSCoV-2 IgM).

9743,Thyroid function abnormalities in COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundThe novel coronavirus COVID-19, has caused a worldwide pandemic, impairing several human organs and systems. Whether COVID-19 affects human thyroid function remains unknown.

Methods84 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine (Hangzhou, China) were respectively enrolled in this study. In addition, 91 other patients with pneumonia and 807 healthy subjects were included as controls.

FindingsWe found that the levels of TT3 and TSH were lower in COVID-19 patients than control groups (p<0{middle dot}001). Within the group of COVID-19 patients, 61.9% patients (52/84) presented with thyroid function abnormalities. We found a larger proportion of patients in severe condition exhibited thyroid dysfunction than mild/moderate cases (74{middle dot}6% vs. 23{middle dot}8%, p < 0{middle dot}001). Patients with thyroid dysfunction tended to have increased interval time for negative conversion of viral nucleic acid (14{middle dot}1 {+/-} 9{middle dot}4 vs. 10{middle dot}6 {+/-} 8{middle dot}3 days, p = 0{middle dot}088). To note, thyroid dysfunction was also associated with decreased lymphocytes (p < 0{middle dot}001) and increased CRP (p = 0{middle dot}002). In 7 patients with dynamic changes of thyroid function, we observed the levels of TT3 and TSH gradually increased and reached normal range without thyroid hormone replacement at Day 30 post-admission. The correlation between TT3 and TSH level seemed to be positive rather than negative in the early stage, and gradually turned to be negatively related over time.

InterpretationsThyroid function abnormalities are common in COVID-19 patients, especially in severe cases. This might be caused by virus attack and damage to the thyroid-pituitary axis. Therefore, more attention should be paid to thyroid function during treatment of COVID-19, and close follow-up is also needed after discharge.

9072,Prevention of household transmission crucial to stop the catastrophic spread of COVID-19 in cities,"After weeks under lockdown, metropolitan areas fighting the spread of COVID-19 aim to balance public health goals with social and economic standards for well-being. Mathematical models of disease transmission seeking to evaluate mitigation strategies must assess the possible impacts of social distancing, economic lockdowns and other measures. However, obscure relations between model parameters and real-world phenomena complicate such analyses. Here, we use a high-resolution metapopulation model of Guadalajara (GDL, Western Mexico) to represent daily mobility patterns driven by economic activities and their relation to epidemic growth. Given the prominence of essential activities in the citys economy, we find that strategies aiming to mitigate the risk of out-of-home interactions are insufficient to stop the catastrophic spread of COVID-19. Using baseline reproduction numbers R0 = [2.5, 3.0] in the absence of interventions, our simulations suggest that household transmission alone can make Rt [~] 1, and is estimated to drive 70 {+/-}15% of current epidemic growth. This sets an upper bound for the impact of mobility-based interventions, which are unlikely to lower Rt below 1.3 and must be complemented with aggressive campaigns for early case detection and isolation. As laboratory testing and health services become insufficient to meet demand in GDL and most other cities, we propose that cities facilitate guidelines and equipment to help people curb spreading within their own homes. Postponing these actions will increase their economic cost and decrease their potential returns.

Author summaryPublic health strategies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in metropolitan areas have focused on preventing transmission in schools, work sites and other public spaces. Here, we use a demographically- and spatially-explicit model of Guadalajara (GDL, Western Mexico) to represent economic lockdowns and their impact on disease spread. Our findings suggest that viral exposure within households accounts for 70{+/-}15% of the epidemics current growth rate. This highlights the importance of early case detection and isolation as necessary measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 between strangers and close contacts alike.","Gutierrez Brizuela, N.; Gutierrez Pulido, H.; Roosa, K.; Garcia Chan, N.; Hernandez-Bello, J.; Munoz-Valle, J.

13491,Integrated packages of non-pharmaceutical interventions increased public health response efficiency against COVID-19 during the first European wave: evidence from 32 European countries,"Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, governments around the World have implemented a combination of public health responses based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), with significant social and economic consequences. Though most European countries have overcome the first epidemic wave, it remains of high priority to quantify the efficiency of different NPIs to inform preparedness for an impending second wave. In this study, combining capture-recapture methods with Bayesian inference in an age-structured mathematical model, we use a unique European dataset compiled by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) to quantify the efficiency of 24 NPIs and their combinations (referred to as public health responses, PHR) in reducing SARS-Cov-2 transmission rates in 32 European countries. Of 166 unique PHR tested, we found that median decrease in viral transmission was 74%, which is enough to suppress the epidemic. PHR efficiency was positively associated with the number of NPIs implemented. We found that bans on mass gatherings had the largest effect among NPIs, followed by school closures, teleworking, and stay home orders. Partial implementation of most NPIs resulted in lower than average response efficiency. This first large-scale estimation of NPI and PHR efficiency against SARS-COV-2 transmission in Europe suggests that a combination of NPIs targeting different population groups should be favored to control future epidemic waves.","Garchitorena, A.; Gruson, H.; Cazelles, B.; Karki, T.; Sudre, B.; Roche, B.",2020-11-16,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.08.17.20174821,2,Benjamin Roche,IRD,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20174821v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20174821v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
14263,Trust and Transparency in times of Crisis: Results from an Online Survey During the First Wave (April 2020) of the COVID-19 Epidemic in the UK,"BackgroundThe success of a governments COVID-19 control strategy relies on public trust and broad acceptance of response measures. We investigated public perceptions of the UK governments COVID-19 response, focusing on the relationship between trust and transparency, during the first wave (April 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom.

MethodsAnonymous survey data were collected (2020-04-06 to 2020-04-22) from 9,322 respondents, aged 20+ using an online questionnaire. We took a mixed methods approach to data analysis, combining statistical analyses, structural topic modelling (STM) and qualitative thematic coding of a sub-set of responses. Missing data were imputed via multiple imputation.

ResultsMost respondents (95.1%) supported government enforcement of behaviour change. While 52.1% of respondents thought the government was making good decisions, differences were apparent across demographic groups, for example respondents from Scotland had lower odds of responding positively than respondents in London. Higher educational levels saw decreasing odds of having a positive opinion of the government response and decreasing household income associated with decreasing positive opinion. Of respondents who thought the government was not making good decisions 60% believed the economy was being prioritised over people and their health. Positive views on government decision-making were associated with positive views on government transparency about the COVID-19 response. Qualitative analysis about government transparency highlighted five key themes: (1) the justification of opacity due to the condition of crisis, (2) generalised mistrust of politics, (3) concerns about the role of scientific evidence, (4) quality of government communication and (5) questions about political decision-making processes.

ConclusionWe recommend targeted community engagement tailored to different groups experiences and a focus on accountability and openness around how decisions are made in the response to the UK COVID-19 pandemic.","Enria, L.; Waterlow, N.; Rogers, N.

13023,"Expanding COVID-19 symptom screening to retail, restaurants, and schools by preserving privacy using relaxed digital signatures","Symptom screening is a widely deployed strategy to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic and many public health authorities are mandating its use by employers for all employees in the workplace. While symptom screening has the benefit of reducing the number of infected individuals in the workplace, it raises some inherently difficult privacy issues as a traditional approach requires the employer to collect symptom data from each employee which is essentially medical information. In this paper, we describe a system to implement Cryptographic Anonymous Symptom Screening (CASS) which allows for individuals to perform COVID symptom screening anonymously while avoiding the privacy issues of traditional approaches. In the system, individuals report their symptoms without any identifying information and are issued a completion certificate. This certificate contains a cryptographic code which certifies that the certificate was obtained from the screener after reporting no symptoms. The codes can be verified using a cryptographic algorithm which is publicly available. A standard cryptography approach to implement such a system would be to use digital signatures. Unfortunately, standard digital signatures have some limitations for this application in that the signatures are often hundreds of characters long and if the signature contains the name of the individual, then there is also a risk of compromising privacy. In our approach, we develop and utilize a relaxed digital signature scheme to provide 16 character long codes and handle names using equivalence classes which helps preserve privacy. Both of these extensions technically compromise the security but in a way that is negligible for this application. Our system can either serve the function of standard symptom screening system approaches for employees, but can also extend symptom screening to non-employees such as visitors or customers. In this case, the system can be utilized in retail, restaurants and schools to ensure that everyone in the physical space, including employees, customers, visitors and students have performed symptom screening.","Jew, B.; Korb, A.; Lou, P.; Chiang, J.

Findings70 (37.0%) of care-homes experienced a COVID-19 outbreak, 66 of which were in care-homes for older people where care-home size was strongly associated with outbreaks (OR per 20-bed increase 3.50, 95%CI 2.06 to 5.94). There were 852 confirmed cases and 419 COVID-related deaths, 401 (95.7%) of which occurred in care-homes with an outbreak, 16 (3.8%) in hospital, and two in the 119 care-homes without a known outbreak. For non-COVID related deaths, there were 73 excess deaths in care-homes with an outbreak, but no excess deaths in care-homes without an outbreak, and 24 fewer deaths than expected of care-home residents in hospital. A quarter of COVID-19 related cases and deaths occurred in five (2.6%) care-homes, and half in 13 (6.9%) care-homes.

InterpretationThe large impact on excess deaths appears to be primarily a direct effect of COVID-19, with cases and deaths are concentrated in a minority of care homes. A key implication is that there is a large pool of susceptible residents if community COVID-19 incidence increases again. Shielding residents from potential sources of infection and rapid action into minimise outbreak size where infection is introduced will be critical in any wave 2.

O_TEXTBOXResearch in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed and the medRxiv preprint server using terms  long-term care,  nursing home,  care home, or  residential care combined with  COVID-19 and/or  SARS-CoV-2, updated to 25th June. The existing published literature highlights the large impact in care-homes, and that atypical disease presentation, asymptomatic carriage and a presymptomatic infectious period is common in both residents and staff. One living systematic review confirms the international outbreak burden among residents and staff and high but varied international mortality rates. International modelling studies have failed to take account of the care-home environment and context, making estimates informed by general community transmission of infection. Only one peer-reviewed study was identified which evaluated US nursing home characteristics associated with outbreaks, finding associations with larger facility size, urban location, and ethnicity, but no association with quality ratings or ownership.

Added value of this study

This study reports data for all 189 care homes in one large Scottish health board, where 37% experienced an outbreak of COVID-19, with 95% of outbreaks in care-homes for older people. The number of beds was the only care-home characteristic statistically significantly associated with the presence of an outbreak. One-third of affected care homes had only single cases or short outbreaks, but sustained outbreaks were common, and there was evidence of potential reintroduction of infection in some care-homes with >14 day gaps between confirmed cases. Cases and mortality were heavily concentrated. In care-homes with an outbreak there were 472 excess deaths (12.3% of bed capacity, 3.1 times the average in the previous five years), 85% of which were COVID-19 related. There were only 16 COVID-19 related deaths and 14 other deaths of care-home residents in hospital in the same period, consistent with [~]20 non-COVID excess deaths occurring in care-homes being deaths that would have happened anyway. 99% of the excess deaths and of the COVID-19 related deaths were in care-homes with an outbreak, suggesting that quality and safety of care in the wider care system was not affected.

Implications of all the available evidence

Outbreak patterns varied considerably and more detailed understanding of why some care homes avoided or controlled outbreaks would allow learning to prepare for wave two. Systematic, regular testing and use of whole genome sequencing will inform understanding of transmission dynamics and future outbreak management. Future research should consider the built environment and organisation of care as other potentially modifiable factors to support infection control. Improving national and local data on the care-home population is a priority both for COVID-19 and for ensuring this vulnerable population receives better care in the future.

19117,Artificial intelligence-enabled analysis of UK and US public attitudes on Facebook and Twitter towards COVID-19 vaccinations,"BackgroundGlobal efforts towards the development and deployment of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 are rapidly advancing. We developed and applied an artificial-intelligence (AI)-based approach to analyse social-media public sentiment in the UK and the US towards COVID-19 vaccinations, to understand public attitude and identify topics of concern.

MethodsOver 300,000 social-media posts related to COVID-19 vaccinations were extracted, including 23,571 Facebook-posts from the UK and 144,864 from the US, along with 40,268 tweets from the UK and 98,385 from the US respectively, from 1st March - 22nd November 2020. We used natural language processing and deep learning based techniques to predict average sentiments, sentiment trends and topics of discussion. These were analysed longitudinally and geo-spatially, and a manual reading of randomly selected posts around points of interest helped identify underlying themes and validated insights from the analysis.

ResultsWe found overall averaged positive, negative and neutral sentiment in the UK to be 58%, 22% and 17%, compared to 56%, 24% and 18% in the US, respectively. Public optimism over vaccine development, effectiveness and trials as well as concerns over safety, economic viability and corporation control were identified. We compared our findings to national surveys in both countries and found them to correlate broadly.

ConclusionsAI-enabled social-media analysis should be considered for adoption by institutions and governments, alongside surveys and other conventional methods of assessing public attitude. This could enable real-time assessment, at scale, of public confidence and trust in COVID-19 vaccinations, help address concerns of vaccine-sceptics and develop more effective policies and communication strategies to maximise uptake.","Hussain, A.; Tahir, A.; Hussain, Z.; Sheikh, Z.; Gogate, M.; Dashtipour, K.; Ali, A.; Sheikh, A.",2020-12-11,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.12.08.20246231,1,Amir Hussain,"Edinburgh Napier University, UK",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.08.20246231v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.08.20246231v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
14437,SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a tri-national urban area is dominated by a B.1 lineage variant linked to mass gathering events,"BackgroundThe first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Basel, Switzerland, was detected on February 26th 2020. We present a phylogenetic longitudinal study and explore viral introduction and evolution during the exponential early phase of the local COVID-19 outbreak from February 26th until March 23rd.

MethodsWe sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from naso-oropharyngeal swabs, generated 468 high quality genomes, and called variants with our COVID-19 Pipeline (COVGAP). We analysed viral genetic diversity using PANGOLIN taxonomic lineages. To identify introduction and dissemination events we incorporated global SARS-CoV-2 genomes and inferred a time-calibrated phylogeny.

FindingsThe early outbreak in Basel was dominated by lineage B.1 (83{middle dot}6%), detected from March 2nd, although the first lineage identified was B.1.1. Within B.1, a clade containing 68{middle dot}2% of our samples, defined by the SNP C15324T, suggests local spreading events. We infer the geographic origin of this mutation to our tri-national region. The remaining genomes map broadly over the global phylogenetic tree, evidencing several events of introduction from and/or dissemination to other regions of the world. We also observe family transmission events.

InterpretationA single lineage dominated the outbreak in the City of Basel while other lineages such as the first (B1.1) did not propagate. Thus spreading events seem to have contributed most to viral spread, while travel returners and family transmissions were better controlled by the recommended measures. This phylogenetic analysis enriches epidemiological and contact tracing data, allowing connection of seemingly unconnected events, and can inform public health interventions.

7600,Early risk assessment for COVID-19 patients from emergency department data using machine learning,"BackgroundSince its emergence in late 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic, with more than 4.8 million reported cases and 310 000 deaths worldwide. While epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have been reported, risk factors underlying the transition from mild to severe disease among patients remain poorly understood.

MethodsIn this retrospective study, we analysed data of 820 confirmed COVID-19 positive patients admitted to a two-site NHS Trust hospital in London, England, between January 1st and April 23rd, 2020, with a majority of cases occurring in March and April. We extracted anonymised demographic data, physiological clinical variables and laboratory results from electronic healthcare records (EHR) and applied multivariate logistic regression, random forest and extreme gradient boosted trees. To evaluate the potential for early risk assessment, we used data available during patients initial presentation at the emergency department (ED) to predict deterioration to one of three clinical endpoints in the remainder of the hospital stay: A) admission to intensive care, B) need for mechanical ventilation and C) mortality. Based on the trained models, we extracted the most informative clinical features in determining these patient trajectories.

ResultsConsidering our inclusion criteria, we have identified 126 of 820 (15%) patients that required intensive care, 62 of 808 (8%) patients needing mechanical ventilation, and 170 of 630 (27%) cases of in-hospital mortality. Our models learned successfully from early clinical data and predicted clinical endpoints with high accuracy, the best model achieving AUC-ROC scores of 0.75 to 0.83 (F1 scores of 0.41 to 0.56). Younger patient age was associated with an increased risk of receiving intensive care and ventilation, but lower risk of mortality. Clinical indicators of a patients oxygen supply and selected laboratory results were most predictive of COVID-19 patient trajectories.

ConclusionAmong COVID-19 patients machine learning can aid in the early identification of those with a poor prognosis, using EHR data collected during a patients first presentation at ED. Patient age and measures of oxygenation status during ED stay are primary indicators of poor patient outcomes.","Heldt, F. S.; Vizcaychipi, M.

13580,Comparisons of COVID-19 dynamics in the different countries of the World using Time-Series clustering,"In recent months, the world has suffered from the appearance of a new strain of coronavirus, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. There are great scientific efforts to find new treatments and vaccines, at the same time that governments, companies, and individuals have taken a series of actions in response to this pandemic. These efforts seek to decrease the speed of propagation, although with significant social and economic costs. Countries have taken different actions, also with different results. In this article we use non-parametric techniques (HT and MST) with the aim of identifying groups of countries with a similar spread of the coronavirus. The variable of interest is the number of daily infections per country. Results show that there are groups of countries with differentiated contagion dynamics, both in the number of contagions plus at the time of the greatest transmission of the disease. It is concluded that the actions taken by the countries, the speed at which they were taken and the number of tests carried out may explain part of the differences in the dynamics of contagion.","Alvarez, E.; Brida, J.

8139,Use of High Flow Nasal Therapy to Treat Moderate to Severe Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure in COVID-19,"Invasive mechanical has been associated with high mortality in COVID-19. Alternative therapy of High flow nasal therapy (HFNT) has been greatly debated around the world for use in COVID-19 pandemic due to concern for increased healthcare worker transmission.

MethodsThis was a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients admitted to Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from March 10, 2020, to April 24, 2020 with moderate to severe respiratory failure treated with High Flow nasal therapy (HFNT). Primary outcome was prevention of intubation.

ResultsOf the 445 patients with COVID-19, 104 met our inclusion criteria. The average age was 60.66 ({+/-}13.50) years, 49 (47.12 %) were female, 53 (50.96%) were African American, 23 (22.12%) Hispanic. Forty-three patients (43.43%) were smokers. SF and chest Xray scores had a statistically significant improvement from day 1 to day 7. 67 of 104 (64.42%) were able to avoid invasive mechanical ventilation in our cohort. Incidence of hospital/ventilator associated pneumonia was 2.9%. Overall, mortality was 14.44% (n=15) in our cohort with 13 (34.4%) in the progressed to intubation group and 2 (2.9%) in the non-intubation group. Mortality and incidence of VAP/HAP was statistically higher in the progressed to intubation group.

ConclusionHFNT use is associated with a reduction in the rate of Invasive mechanical ventilation and overall mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection.

2448,"The effect of control strategies that reduce social mixing on outcomes of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China","BACKGROUNDIn December 2019, a novel strain of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures and efforts in response to the outbreak.

METHODSWe quantified the effects of control measures on population contact patterns in Wuhan, China, to assess their effects on the progression of the outbreak. We included the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model fitted to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in the age-structured epidemic framework. Further, we looked at the age-distribution of cases. Lastly, we simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way, and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak.

FINDINGSChanges in mixing patterns may have contributed to reducing the number of infections in mid-2020 by 92% (interquartile range: 66-97%). There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of reducing the height of the peak, overall epidemic size in mid-2020 and probability that a second peak may occur after return to work. However, the modelled effects of social distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children play in the epidemic.

INTERPRETATIONRestrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would likely contribute to the reduction and delay the epidemic size and peak, respectively. However, there are some limitations to the analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R0 and the duration of infectiousness.

DesignEpidemiologic investigation

Setting and ParticipantsAll confirmed COVID-19 cases in the State of Qatar between February 28 and April 18, 2020

Main Outcome MeasuresNumber of total and daily new COVID-19 infections; demographic characteristics and comorbidity burden and severity of infection; factors associated with severe or critical illness

ResultsBetween February 28 and April 18, 2020 (11:00AM local time), 5,685 cases of COVID-19 were identified. Mean age (SD) was 35.8(12.0) years, 88.9% were male and 8.7% were Qatari nationals. Overall, 83.6% had no concomitant comorbidity, and 3.0% had 3 or more comorbidities. The overwhelming majority (90.9%) were asymptomatic or with minimal symptoms, with 2.0% having severe or critical illness. Presence of hypertension or diabetes were associated with a higher risk of severe or critical illness. Seven deaths were observed during the time interval studied. The epidemiologic curve indicated two distinct patterns of infection, a larger cluster among expatriate craft and manual workers, and a smaller one among Qatari nationals returning from abroad during the epidemic.

ConclusionCOVID-19 infections in Qatar started in two distinct clusters, but then became more widespread in the population through community transmission. Infections were mostly asymptomatic or with minimal symptoms and associated with very low mortality. Severe/critical illness was associated with presence of hypertension or diabetes.

O_TEXTBOXWhat is already known on this topicAs of May 3, 2020, over 3.4 million persons have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and over 244,000 deaths have been reported in persons with COVID-19 infection. Those at higher risk of complications include persons over age 60 years and those with chronic comorbid conditions. Mortality rate varies widely among different countries, and this can be associated both to the capacity of the health system to provide effective intensive care including ventilators as well as other factors, including demographic differences. Public health measures seem effective, but there is debate on the extent to which the measures need to be aggressive or the duration for which they should be implemented.

What this study addsThis study reports on the epidemic curve in a population with a unique demographic structure, comprising an overwhelming majority of expatriates and young male craft and manual workers. This is also the first study that reports on the epidemic curve of an Arab country in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). The study also overlays major public health measures on the epidemic curve, to provide an understanding of the context in which the epidemic is progressing. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Qatar were young with few comorbidities. Case fatality rate was very low (only 7 deaths among 5,685 infected persons). Severe and critical illness were associated with presence of hypertension or diabetes.

13410,The basic reproduction number can be accurately estimated within 14 days after societal lockdown: The early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark,"ObjectiveEarly identification of the basic reproduction number (BRN) is imperative to political decision making during an epidemic. In this study, we estimated the BRN 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after societal lockdown of Denmark during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic.

MethodWe implemented the SEIR dynamical system for disease spread without vital dynamics. The BRN was modulated using a sigmoid function. Model parameters were estimated on number of admitted patients, number of patients in intensive care and cumulative number of deaths using the simulated annealing Monte Carlo algorithm. Results are presented with 95% prediction intervals (PI).

ResultsWe were unable to determine any reliable estimate of the BRN at 7 days following lockdown. The BRN had stabilised at day 14 throughout day 28, with the estimate ranging from 0.95 (95% PI: 0.92-0.98) at day 7 to 0.92 (95% PI: 0.92-0.93) at day 28. We estimated the BRN prior to lockdown to be 3.32 (95% PI: 3.31-3.33). The effect of the lockdown was occurring over a period of a few days centred at March 18th (95% PI: 17th-18th) 2020.

ConclusionWe believe our model provides a valuable tool for decision makers to reliably estimate the effect of a politically determined lockdown during an epidemic.","Valentin, J.

2286,Optimal timing of one-shot interventions for epidemic control,"The apparent early success in Chinas large-scale intervention to control the COVID-19 epidemic has led to interest in whether other countries can replicate it as well as concerns about a resurgence of the epidemic if or when China relaxes the interventions. In this paper we look at the impact of a single short-term intervention on an epidemic. We see that if an intervention cannot be sustained long-term, it has the greatest impact if it is imposed once infection levels have become large enough that there is an appreciable number of infections present. For minimising the total number infected it should start close to the peak so that there is no rebound once the intervention is stopped, while to minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, allowing two peaks of comparable size rather than one very large peak. In populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each sub-population separately.

We do not attempt to clearly determine what makes an intervention sustainable or not. We believe that is a policy question. If an intervention is sustainable, it should be kept in place. Our intent is to offer insight into how best to time an intervention whose impact on society is too great to maintain.","Di Lauro, F.; Kiss, I.

14012,Predictors of healthcare worker burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic,"ObjectiveWe aim to provide a  snapshot of the levels of burnout, anxiety, depression and distress among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Design, setting, participantsWe distributed an online survey via social media in June 2020 that was open to any UK healthcare worker. The primary outcome measure was symptoms of burnout as measured using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI). Secondary outcomes of depression, anxiety and distress as measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, General Anxiety Scale-7, and Impact of Events Scale-Revised were recorded along with subjective measures of stress. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with burnout, depression, anxiety and distress.

ResultsOf 539 persons responding to the survey, 90% were female, and 26% were aged 41-50 years, 53% were nurses. Participants with moderate-to-severe burnout were younger (49% [206/424] versus 33% [38/115] under 40 years, P=0.004), and more likely to have pre-existing comorbidities (21% versus 12%, P=0.031). They were twice as likely to have been redeployed from their usual role (22% versus 11%; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-3.3, P=0.042), or to work in an area dedicated to COVID-19 patients (50% versus 32%, adjusted OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8, P<0.001), and were almost 4-times more likely to have previous depression (24% versus 7%; adjusted OR 3.6, 95% CI 2.2-5.9, P=0.012). A supportive workplace team and male sex protected against burnout reducing the odds by 40% (adjusted OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.7, P<0.001) and 70% (adjusted OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.5, P=0.003), respectively.

ConclusionIndependent predictors of burnout were younger staff, redeployment to a new working area, working with patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, and being female or having a previous history of depression. Evaluation of existing psychological support interventions is required with targeted approaches to ensure support is available to those most at risk.","Ferry, A. V.; Wereski, R.; Strachan, F.

2195,Closed environments facilitate secondary transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"ObjectiveTo identify common features of cases with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) so as to better understand what factors promote secondary transmission including superspreading events.

MethodsA total of 110 cases were examined among eleven clusters and sporadic cases, and investigated who acquired infection from whom. The clusters included four in Tokyo and one each in Aichi, Fukuoka, Hokkaido, Ishikawa, Kanagawa and Wakayama prefectures. The number of secondary cases generated by each primary case was calculated using contact tracing data.

ResultsOf the 110 cases examined, 27 (24.6%) were primary cases who generated secondary cases. The odds that a primary case transmitted COVID-19 in a closed environment was 18.7 times greater compared to an open-air environment (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.0, 57.9).

ConclusionsIt is plausible that closed environments contribute to secondary transmission of COVID-19 and promote superspreading events. Our findings are also consistent with the declining incidence of COVID-19 cases in China, as gathering in closed environments was prohibited in the wake of the rapid spread of the disease.","Nishiura, H.; Oshitani, H.; Kobayashi, T.; Saito, T.; Sunagawa, T.; Matsui, T.; Wakita, T.; Mhlw Covid-19 Response Team,  ; Suzuki, M.",2020-04-16,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.02.28.20029272,2,Hiroshi Nishiura,Hokkaido University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20029272v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20029272v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
15694,Changes to the sebum lipidome upon COVID-19 infection observed via non-invasive and rapid sampling from the skin,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an urgent and unprecedented demand for testing - both for diagnosis and prognosis. Here we explore the potential for using sebum, collected via swabbing of a patients skin, as a novel sampling matrix to fulfil these requirements. In this pilot study, sebum samples were collected from 67 hospitalised patients (30 PCR positive and 37 PCR negative). Lipidomics analysis was carried out using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Lipid levels were found to be depressed in COVID-19 positive participants, indicative of dyslipidemia. Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) modelling showed promising separation of COVID-19 positive and negative participants when comorbidities and medication were controlled for, with sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 81% in stratified subsets. Given that sebum sampling is rapid and non-invasive, this work highlights the potential of this alternative matrix for testing for COVID-19.","Spick, M.

7525,Asymptomatic COVID-19 Have Longer Treatment Cycle Than Moderate Type of Confirmed Patients,"ObjectivesA kind of pneumonia caused by unknown causes that occurred in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019, was reported as a result of novel coronavirus infection on January 7, 2020, and then WHO named it COVID-19. To compare the difference of epidemiology and clinical characteristics between asymptomatic COVID-19 infections and moderate type of confirmed cases.

MethodsRetrospective, single-center cohort study of COVID-19 involving 52 infections of both 26 asymptomatic and 26 moderate type of confirmed cases in the recovery stage at Guizhou Provincial Staff Hospital in Guiyang, China, from January 29, to March 31, 2020; final date of follow-up was April 22. This study was registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Center. Documented the asymptomatic COVID-19 infections and moderate type of confirmed cases. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections and moderate type of confirmed cases were compared.

ResultsThe median treatment cycle of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections was 16 days (interquartile range, 11-20 days) and longer than 13 days (interquartile range, 10-15 days) of moderate type of confirmed cases (p=0.049). The median incubation period of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections was 10 days (interquartile range, 0-21 days), while the control group was 7 days (interquartile range, 1-15 days) (p=0.27). On the initial chest computerized tomography (CT) check, 18 (69.2%, 18/26) asymptomatic COVID-19 infections were no imaging changes, which was of no significance compared with 12 (46.2%, 12/26) patients with moderate type of confirmed patients (p=0.092).

ConclusionsIn this single-center study, we found that asymptomatic COVID-19 infections have longer treatment cycle than those moderate type of confirmed cases.

Key PointsIn this single-center case series involving 52 infections with asymptomatic and moderate type of COVID-19 cases, asymptomatic COVID-19 infections have longer treatment cycle than those moderate type of confirmed patients.","Zhang, W.; Long, Q.; Huang, Y.; Chen, C.; Wu, J.; Hong, Y.; Zhou, H.; Wu, W.",2020-06-25,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.16.20103796,2,Wei Zhang,Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.16.20103796v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.16.20103796v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
10879,Prevalence of IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among clinic staff and patients,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now a pandemic with devastating social and economic consequences. The extent of the spread of COVID-19 within populations is uncertain since diagnostic tests have not been carried out on all eligible persons and doing such diagnostic tests on everyone is much less feasible in developing countries such as Nigeria. Tests for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, are more affordable, readily available, and require minimal training than current diagnostic tests. Employing a seroepidemiological strategy, serological tests were conducted on 66 volunteering staff and patients at the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (UCTH), a Federal Government owned tertiary healthcare facility, to determine the extent of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, from 17th to 25th June 2020. Using a COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette with emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States, it was observed that of the 66 samples tested, 5 (7.6%) were both IgG and IgM positive and 17 (26%) were IgG positive. Moreover, for 44 of the 66 participants, simultaneous tests were carried out using a rapid test kit from a different manufacturer but without FDA-EUA and all the results completely matched with the FDA-EUA kit, except one case where the FDA-EUA kit showed positive for both IgG and IgM while the other kit was positive only for IgM. The 26% positive IgG indicates a high exposure rate for the hospital staff and patients and points to community transmission where the facility is situated. Hence, immediate activation of WHO guidelines for controlling community transmission is called for. These results can further serve as a pilot study to guide public health policies in response to COVID-19 pandemic in both the general population and in healthcare settings.","Asuquo, M.

19115,Contacts and behaviours of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic at the start of the 2020/21 academic year,"CONQUEST (COroNavirus QUESTionnaire) is an online survey of contacts, behaviour, and COVID-19 symptoms for University of Bristol (UoB) staff/students. We analysed survey results from the start of the 2020/2021 academic year, prior to the second national lockdown (14/09/2020-01/11/2020), where COVID-19 outbreaks led to lockdown of some student halls of residence. The aim of these analyses was to enhance knowledge of student contact patterns to inform infection disease mathematical modelling approaches.

Responses captured information on demographics, contacts on the previous day, symptoms and self-isolation during the prior week, and COVID-19 status.

740 students provided 1261 unique records. Of 42 (3%) students testing positive in the prior fortnight, 99% had been self-isolating. The median number of contacts on the previous day was 2 (interquartile range: 1-5), mode: 1, mean: 6.1; 8% had [&ge;]20 contacts. 57% of student contacts were other UoB students/staff.

Most students reported few daily contacts but there was heterogeneity, and some reported many.

19582,Routine SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance results in Turkey to follow Covid-19 outbreak,"1.A global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SAR-CoV-2) declared by WHO in March 2019 is still ongoing. As of 13th of December 2020, 70 million people were infected by SARS-CoV-2 and 1.5 million people lost their lives globally (WHO, 2020). Since March 2019, diagnosis of Covid-19 cases has been done through PCR test of samples from nasopharyngeal and throat swabs. However, in March 2019, it was reported that the faeces [1] and urine [2] of all infected people contain SARS-CoV-2. Later, numerous researchers [3-7] detected SARS-CoV-2 in faeces of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Moreover, some studies [1,4,8-12] suggested the possibility of extended duration of viral shedding in faeces after the patients respiratory samples tested negative. In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), i.e., wastewater surveillance, aiming to estimate the distribution of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals in a specific region has received worldwide attention. Various research groups worldwide [1, 13-54] have started SARS-CoV-2 detection in wastewater since WBE provides tracking whole population by testing a small number of wastewater samples in a specific region and can predict SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human faeces a few days to a week before onset of symptoms. This makes WBE quite economic tool for continual tracking of decreasing or increasing trend of the Covid-19 in a particular region. However, up to date, almost all of the WBE studies have been performed with samples from a few treatment plants. There was no reported nationwide wastewater surveillance study that has been integrated into a national Covid-19 management strategy by decision makers. Nationwide, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance studies have great potential to reflect the actual distribution of Covid-19 cases in a community by accounting not only symptomatic patients tested but also asymptomatic patients having no or mild symptoms and not been tested. As opposed to clinical surveillance studies, wastewater-based surveillance studies will reflect the number of cases in a community by testing one sample from a treatment plant serving this community instead of performing individual swab tests.

Turkey, which is among the few countries that started wastewater based surveillance studies at the early stages of pandemic is a leading country, performing a nationwide surveillance study. The distribution of Covid-19 cases throughout the country via SARS-CoV-2 measurements in influent, effluent and sludge samples of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in 81 cities through May 2020-June 2020 was conducted [36, 51, 52]. In June 2020, nationwide routine sampling through 22 regional identified cities has been started. However, from June to September 2020 all samples were detected negative due to problems with RT-pCR primer targeting RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2 genome. Since September 2020, routine sampling from 22 cities of Turkey with 2 weeks sampling period (weekly for mega city Istanbul) has been continued and regional Covid-19 distributions have been reported as viral loads on color-scale maps. To the best our knowledge, this is the first routine nationwide surveillance study indicating Covid-19 distribution regularly using color-scale presentation on a map.","Alpaslan Kocamemi, B.; Kurt, H.; Sait, A.; Kadi, H.; Sarac, F.; Aydin, I.; Saatci, A.

8900,Side by side comparison of three fully automated SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays with a focus on specificity,"Background:

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous new serological test systems for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have become available quickly. However, the clinical performance of many of them is still insufficiently described. Therefore we compared three commercial, CE-marked, SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays side by side.

Methods:

We included a total of 1,154 specimens from pre-COVID-19 times and 65 samples from COVID-19 patients ([&ge;]14 days after symptom onset) to evaluate the test performance of SARS-CoV-2 serological assays by Abbott, Roche, and DiaSorin.

Results:

All three assays presented with high specificities: 99.2% (98.6-99.7) for Abbott, 99.7% (99.2-100.0) for Roche, and 98.3% (97.3-98.9) for DiaSorin. In contrast to the manufacturers specifications, sensitivities only ranged from 83.1% to 89.2%. Although the three methods were in good agreement (Cohens Kappa 0.71-0.87), McNemars test revealed significant differences between results obtained from Roche and DiaSorin. However, at low seroprevalences, the minor differences in specificity resulted in profound discrepancies of positive predictability at 1% seroprevalence: 52.3% (36.2-67.9), 77.6% (52.8-91.5), and 32.6% (23.6-43.1) for Abbott, Roche, and DiaSorin, respectively.

Conclusion:

We find diagnostically relevant differences in specificities for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays by Abbott, Roche, and DiaSorin that have a significant impact on the positive predictability of these tests.","Perkmann, T.; Perkmann-Nagele, N.; Breyer, M.-K.; Breyer-Kohansal, R.; Burghuber, O.

10635,"A Robust, Safe and Scalable Magnetic Nanoparticle Workflow for RNA Extraction of Pathogens from Clinical and Environmental Samples","Diagnosis and surveillance of emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 depend on nucleic acid isolation from clinical and environmental samples. Under normal circumstances, samples would be processed using commercial proprietary reagents in Biosafety 2 (BSL-2) or higher facilities. A pandemic at the scale of COVID-19 has caused a global shortage of proprietary reagents and BSL-2 laboratories to safely perform testing. Therefore, alternative solutions are urgently needed to address these challenges. We developed an open-source method called Magnetic-nanoparticle-Aided Viral RNA Isolation of Contagious Samples (MAVRICS) that is built upon reagents that are either readily available or can be synthesized in any molecular biology laboratory with basic equipment. Unlike conventional methods, MAVRICS works directly in samples inactivated in acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform (e.g., TRIzol), thus allowing infectious samples to be handled safely without biocontainment facilities. Using 36 COVID-19 patient samples, 2 wastewater samples and 1 human pathogens control sample, we showed that MAVRICS rivals commercial kits in validated diagnostic tests of SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus. MAVRICS is scalable and thus could become an enabling technology for widespread community testing and wastewater monitoring in the current and future pandemics.","Ramos-Mandujano, G.; Salunke, R.; Mfarrej, S.; Rachmadi, A.; Hala, S.; Xu, J.; Alofi, F.

3279,Government Responses Matter: Predicting Covid-19 cases in US under an empirical Bayesian time series framework,"Since the Covid-19 outbreak, researchers have been predicting how the epidemic will evolve, especially the number in each country, through using parametric extrapolations based on the history. In reality, the epidemic progressing in a particular country depends largely on its policy responses and interventions. Since the outbreaks in some countries are earlier than United States, the prediction of US cases can benefit from incorporating the similarity in their trajectories. We propose an empirical Bayesian time series framework to predict US cases using different countries as prior reference. The resultant forecast is based on observed US data and prior information from the reference country while accounting for different population sizes. When Italy is used as prior in the prediction, which the US data resemble the most, the cases in the US will exceed 300,000 by the beginning of April unless strong measures are adopted.","Liu, Z.; Guo, W.",2020-03-30,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.03.28.20044578,1,Ziyue Liu,Indiana University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20044578v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20044578v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
9234,Evidence for ethnic inequalities in mortality related to COVID-19 infections: Findings from an ecological analysis of England and Wales,"BackgroundIn the absence of direct data on ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 related mortality in the UK, we examine the relationship between ethnic composition of an area and rate of mortality in the area.

MethodsEcological analysis using COVID-19 related mortality rates occurring by 24th April 2020, and ethnic composition of the population, across local authorities in England and Wales. Account is taken of age, population density, area deprivation and pollution.

ResultsFor every 1% rise in proportion of the population who are ethnic minority, COVID-19 related deaths increased by 5{middle dot}10 (3{middle dot}99 to 6{middle dot}21) per million. This rise is present for each ethnic minority category examined. The size of this increase is a little reduced in a fully adjusted model, suggesting that some of the association results from ethnic minority people living in more densely populated, more polluted and more deprived areas.

This estimate suggests that the average England and Wales COVID-19 related death rate would rise by 25% in a local authority with twice the average number of ethnic minority people.

DiscussionWe find clear evidence that rates of COVID-19 related mortality within a local authority increase as the proportion of the population who are ethnic minority increases. We suggest that this is a consequence of social and economic inequalities, including among key workers, driven by entrenched structural and institutional racism and racial discrimination. We argue that these factors should be central to any investigation of ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 outcomes.","Nazroo, J.; Becares, L.",2020-06-09,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.08.20125153,1,James Nazroo,University of Manchester,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.08.20125153v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.08.20125153v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
3158,The Potential Impact of COVID-19 in Refugee Camps in Bangladesh and Beyond: a modeling study,"BackgroundCOVID-19 could have even more dire consequences in refugees camps than in general populations. Bangladesh has confirmed COVID-19 cases and hosts almost 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar with 600,000 concentrated in Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site (age mean: 21 years, sd: 18 years, 52% female). Projections of the potential COVID-19 burden, epidemic speed, and healthcare needs in such settings are critical for preparedness planning.

Methods and FindingsTo explore the potential impact of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, we used a stochastic SEIR transmission model with parameters derived from emerging literature and age as the primary determinant of infection severity. We considered three scenarios with different assumptions about the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2. From the simulated infections, we estimated hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare needs expected, age-adjusted for the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site age distribution.

Our findings suggest that a large-scale outbreak is likely after a single introduction of the virus into the camp with 61-92% of simulations leading to at least 1,000 people infected across scenarios. On average, in the first 30 days of the outbreak, we expect 18 (95% prediction interval (PI), 2-65), 54 (95% PI, 3-223), and 370 (95% PI, 4-1,850) people infected in the low, moderate, and high transmission scenarios, respectively. These reach 421,500 (95% PI, 376,300-463,500), 546,800 (95% PI, 499,300-567,000) and 589,800 (95% PI, 578,800-595,600) people infected in 12 months, respectively. Hospitalization needs exceeded the existing hospitalization capacity of 340 beds after 55-136 days between the low and high transmission scenarios. We estimate 2,040 (95% PI, 1,660-2,500), 2,650 (95% PI, 2,030-3,380), and 2,880 (95% PI, 2,090-3,830) deaths in the low, moderate and high transmission scenarios, respectively.

Due to limited data at the time of analyses, we assumed that age was the primary determinant of infection severity and hospitalization. We expect that comorbidities and limited hospitalization and intensive care capacity may increase this risk, thus we may be underestimating the potential burden.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest that a COVID-19 epidemic in a refugee settlement may have profound consequences, requiring large increases in healthcare capacity and infrastructure that may exceed what is currently feasible in these settings. Detailed and realistic planning for the worst-case in Kutupalong-Balukhali and all refugee camps worldwide must begin now. Plans should consider novel and radical strategies to reduce infectious contacts and fill health worker gaps while recognizing that refugees may not have access to national health systems.

C_LIO_LIBangladesh, which has confirmed COVID-19 cases, hosts almost 900,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar in the Coxs Bazar district, approximately 600,000 of whom are concentrated in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site.
C_LIO_LIThe capacity to meet the existing health needs of this population is limited; an outbreak of COVID-19 within this population threatens to severely disrupt an already fragile situation.
C_LIO_LIWe conducted this study to estimate the number of people infected, hospitalizations, and deaths that might occur in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site to inform ongoing preparedness and response activities by the Bangladesh government, the United Nations agencies, and other national and international actors.
C_LI

O_LSTWhat did the researchers do and find?C_LSTO_LIUsing a dynamic model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we simulated how a COVID-19 outbreak could spread within the Expansion Site according to three possible transmission scenarios (high, moderate, and low).
C_LIO_LIOur results suggest that a large-scale outbreak is very likely in this setting after a single infectious person enters the camp, with 0.5-91% of the population expected to be infected within the first three months and over 70-98% during the first year depending on the transmission scenario, should no effective interventions be put into place.
C_LIO_LIHospitalization needs may exceed the existing hospitalization capacity of 340 beds after 55-136 days of introduction.
C_LI

O_LSTWhat do these findings mean?C_LSTO_LIA COVID-19 epidemic in a high population density refugee settlement may have profound consequences, requiring increases in healthcare capacity and infrastructure that exceed what is feasible in this setting.
C_LIO_LIAs many of the approaches used to prevent and respond to COVID-19 in the most affected areas so far will not be practical in humanitarian settings, novel and untested strategies to protect the most vulnerable population groups should be considered, as well as innovative solutions to fill health workforce gaps.

15099,"COVID-19 and human milk: SARS-CoV-2, antibodies, and neutralizing capacity","Background: It is not known whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from mother to infant during breastfeeding, and if so whether the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh this risk. This study was designed to evaluate 1) if SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in milk and on the breast of infected women, 2) concentrations of milk-borne anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and 3) the capacity of milk to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Methods: We collected 37 milk samples and 70 breast swabs (before and after breast washing) from 18 women recently diagnosed with COVID-19. Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-qPCR. Milk was also analyzed for IgA and IgG specific for the nucleocapsid protein, receptor binding domain (RBD), S2 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as 2 seasonal coronaviruses using ELISA; and for its ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Results: We did not detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in any milk sample. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on several breast swabs, although only one was considered conclusive. All milk contained SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG, and levels of anti-RBD IgA correlated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Strong correlations between levels of IgA and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses were noted. Conclusions: Our data do not support maternal-to-child transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via milk; however, risk of transmission via breast skin should be further evaluated. Importantly, milk produced by infected mothers is a source of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 activity. These results support recommendations to continue breastfeeding during mild-to-moderate maternal COVID-19 illness.","Pace, R. M.; Williams, J. E.; Järvinen, K. M.; Belfort, M. B.; Pace, C.

17344,Modeling-based UV-C decontamination of N95 masks optimized to avoid undertreatment,"As the Coronavirus 2019 pandemic creates worldwide shortages of personal protective equipment, hospitals have increasingly turned to sterilization and re-use protocols, often without significant data supporting the specific methodologies. When using UV-C irradiation, previously shown to be effective for decontaminating hard surfaces, modeling shows the importance of accounting for the porosity and non-uniform curvature of the N95 masks in decontamination procedures. Data shows a standard incident dose of 1 J/cm2 delivered to both front and back surfaces is more than 500x higher than the known kill dose. However, modeling indicates this would undertreat 40% of the mask material due to the curvature, path-length attenuation and scatter. Multidirectional UV-C irradiation employing dose calibrated exposures can adjust for this loss and best decontaminate masks. Such protocols can be rapidly implemented in thousands of hospitals across the world equipped with UV-C irradiation lamps without the need for additional capital equipment purchases.","Sears, A.

14986,A comparative study and application of modified SIR and Logistic models at Municipal Corporation level database of CoViD-19 in India,"The WHO declared a global pandemic owing to the newfound coronavirus, or Covid-19, in March 2020. The disease quickly spread around the world by contagion, and the lack of an appropriate vaccine has led to limited social activities in every track of life. Several national and state-level studies conducted predict the course of the pandemic using machine learning algorithms, most common being the SIR and the Logistic models. However, it is unclear whether these models work for a controlled community like Municipal Corporation or not. With measures now being employed at Municipal levels in India, it only fits to conduct particular research to examine how these models perform at lower jurisdictions. This study provides concrete evidence to show the superiority of the modified SIR model over the Logistic model based on analysis. The models not only give accurate predictions for up to 14 days but can also be used to define and signify the practicality and effectiveness of the decisions taken by the authorities. This feature of the study allows us to justly say that the government action of Unlock 1.0 was not a wise decision considering the nature of the pandemic. This study hopes to help the authorities to take the proper actions to prevent any further aggravation of the spreading virus. In conclusion, Municipal corporations having control should make use of this study to make decisions and test their effectiveness, and more corporations should be empowered to benefit from this study.","Bajaj, N.

17418,Preferential observation of large infectious disease outbreaks leads to consistent overestimation of intervention efficacy.,"Data from infectious disease outbreaks in congregate settings are often used to elicit clues about which types of interventions may be useful in other facilities. This is commonly done using before-and-after comparisons in which the infectiousness of pre-intervention cases is compared to that of post-intervention cases and the difference is attributed to intervention impact. In this manuscript, we show how a tendency to preferentially observe large outbreaks can lead to consistent overconfidence in how effective these interventions actually are. We show, in particular, that these inferences are highly susceptible to bias when the pathogen under consideration exhibits moderate-to-high amounts of heterogeneity in infectiousness. This includes important pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, influenza, Noroviruses, HIV, Tuberculosis, and many others","Zelner, J.; Masters, N.

18620,On the anti-correlation between COVID-19 infection rate and natural UV light in the UK,"While it is well established that the rate of COVID-19 infections can be suppressed by social distancing, environmental effects may also affect the infection rate. Here we consider the hypothesis that natural Ultra-Violet (UV) light (UVA and UVB) is reducing COVID-19 infections by enhancing human immunity through vitamin-D and/or by suppressing the virus itself. We focus on the United Kingdom (UK), by examining daily COVID-19 infections (F) and UV Index (UVI) data over the period March to October 2020. We find an intriguing empirical anti-correlation between log10(F) and log10(UVI) with a correlation coefficient of -0.933 over the period from 11 May (when the first UK lockdown ended) to 28 October 2020. The anticorrelation may reflect causation with other factors which are correlated with the UVI. Either way, UVI should be included in modelling the pattern of COVID-19 infections and deaths. We started quantifying such correlations in other countries and regions.","Blum, A.; Nicolaou, C.; Henghes, B.; Lahav, O.",2020-11-30,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.11.28.20240242,1,Ofer Lahav,UCL,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.28.20240242v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.28.20240242v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
17377,The CCR5-delta32 variant might explain part of the association between COVID-19 and the chemokine-receptor gene cluster,"A polymorphism in the LZTFL1 gene located in the chemokine-receptor gene cluster (chromosome 3p) has been associated with the risk of developing COVID-19. The chemokine receptor-5 (CCR5) maps to this region, and the common 32 bp deletion variant ({Delta}32) has been associated with the extent of inflammatory disease and the outcome in several viral diseases. Several studies have also suggested that the pharmacological targeting of CCR5 could reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19. We sought to investigate whether this polymorphism was associated with the risk of moderate-severe COVID-19.

We genotyped 294 patients who required hospitalization due to COVID-19 (85 were severe cases) and 460 controls. We found a significantly lower frequency of CCR5-{Delta}32 among the COVID-19 patients (0.10 vs 0.18 in controls; p=0.002, OR=0.48, 95%CI=0.29-0.76). The difference was mainly due to the reduced frequency of CCR5-{Delta}32 carriers in the severe, significantly lower than in the non-severe patients (p=0.036). Of note, we did not find deletion-homozygotes among the patients compared to 1% among controls. We also confirmed the association between a LZTFL1 variant and COVID-19. Our study points to CCR5 as a promising target for treatment of COVID-19, but requires validation in additional large cohorts. In confirmed by others, the genetic analysis of CCR5-variants (such as {Delta}32) might help to identify patients with a higher susceptibility to severe COVID-19.","Gomez, J.; Cuesta-Llavona, E.; Albaiceta, G.

15751,"Global, regional, and national estimates of target population sizes for COVID-19 vaccination","Abstract Background COVID-19 vaccine prioritization and allocation strategies that maximize health benefit through efficient use of limited resources are urgently needed. We aimed to provide global, regional, and national estimates of target population sizes for COVID-19 vaccination to inform country-specific immunization strategies on a global scale. Methods Based on a previous study of international allocation for pandemic COVID-19 vaccines, we classified the entire world population into eleven priority groups. Information on priority groups was derived from a multi-pronged search of official websites, media sources and academic journal articles. The sizes of different priority groups were projected for 194 countries globally. Results Overall, the size of COVID-19 vaccine recipient population varied markedly by goals of the vaccination program and geography. The general population aged <60 years without any underlying condition accounts for the majority of the total population (5.2 billion people, 68%), followed by 2.3 billion individuals at risk of severe disease, and 46.9 million essential workers which are critical to maintaining a functional society. Differences in the demographic structure, presence of underlying conditions, and number of essential workers led to highly variable estimates of target populations both at the WHO region and country level. In particular, Europe has the highest share of essential workers (6.8%) and the highest share of individuals with underlying conditions (37.8%), two priority categories to maintain societal functions and reduce severe burden. In contrast, Africa has the highest share of healthy adults, school-age individuals, and infants (77.6%), which are the key groups to target to reduce community transmission. Interpretation The sizeable distribution of target groups on a country and regional bases underlines the importance of equitable and efficient vaccine prioritization and allocation globally. The direct and indirect benefits of COVID-19 vaccination should be balanced by considering local differences in demography and health.","Wang, W.; Wu, Q.; Yang, J.; Dong, K.; Chen, X.; Bai, X.; Chen, X.; Chen, Z.; Viboud, C.; Ajelli, M.; Yu, H.",2020-09-30,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.09.29.20200469,1,Hongjie Yu,"Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.29.20200469v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.29.20200469v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
7039,On the Generation of Medical Dialogues for COVID-19,"Under the pandemic of COVID-19, people experiencing COVID19-related symptoms or exposed to risk factors have a pressing need to consult doctors. Due to hospital closure, a lot of consulting services have been moved online. Because of the shortage of medical professionals, many people cannot receive online consultations timely. To address this problem, we aim to develop a medical dialogue system that can provide COVID19-related consultations. We collected two dialogue datasets - CovidDialog - (in English and Chinese respectively) containing conversations between doctors and patients about COVID-19. On these two datasets, we train several dialogue generation models based on Transformer, GPT, and BERT-GPT. Since the two COVID-19 dialogue datasets are small in size, which bear high risk of overfitting, we leverage transfer learning to mitigate data deficiency. Specifically, we take the pretrained models of Transformer, GPT, and BERT-GPT on dialog datasets and other large-scale texts, then finetune them on our CovidDialog datasets. Experiments demonstrate that these approaches are promising in generating meaningful medical dialogues about COVID-19. But more advanced approaches are needed to build a fully useful dialogue system that can offer accurate COVID-related consultations. The data and code are available at https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-Dialogue","Yang, W.; Zeng, G.; Tan, B.; Ju, Z.; Chakravorty, S.; He, X.; Chen, S.; Yang, X.; Wu, Q.; Yu, Z.; Xing, E.; Xie, P.",2020-05-15,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.05.08.20095810,1,Pengtao Xie,University of California San Diego,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.08.20095810v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.08.20095810v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
9572,Estimating the Effect and Cost-Effectiveness of Facemasks in Reducing the Spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Uganda,"Evidence that face masks provide effective protection against respiratory infections in the community is scarce. However, face masks are widely used by health workers as part of droplet precautions when caring for patients with respiratory infections. It would therefore be reasonable to suggest that consistent widespread use of face masks in the community could prevent further spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study we examine public face mask wearing in Uganda where a proportion wears masks to protect against acquiring, and the other to prevent from transmitting SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this study was to determine what percentage of the population would have to wear face masks to reduce susceptibility to and infectivity of SARS-COV-2 in Uganda, keeping the basic reproduction number below unity and/or flattening the curve. We used an SEIAQRD model for the analysis. Results show that implementation of facemasks has a relatively large impact on the size of the coronavirus epidemic in Uganda. We find that the critical mask adherence is 5 per 100 when 80% wear face masks. A cost-effective analysis shows that utilizing funds to provide 1 public mask to the population has a per capita compounded cost of USD 1.34. If provision of face masks is done simultaneously with supportive care, the per capita compounded cost is USD 1.965, while for the case of only treatment and no provision of face masks costs each Ugandan USD 4.0579. We conclude that since it is hard to achieve a 100% adherence to face masks, government might consider provision of face masks in conjunction with provision of care.","Nannyonga, B. K.; Wanyenze, R.

3476,Harmonizing heterogeneous endpoints in COVID-19 trials without loss of information - an essential step to facilitate decision making,"BackgroundMany trials are now underway to inform decision-makers on potential effects of treatments for COVID-19. To provide sufficient information for all involved decision-makers (clinicians, public health authorities, drug regulatory agencies) a multiplicity of endpoints must be considered. It is a challenge to generate detailed high quality evidence from data while ensuring fast availability and evaluation of the results.

MethodsWe reviewed all interventional COVID-19 trials on Remdesivir, Lopinavir/ritonavir and Hydroxychloroquine registered in the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and summarized the endpoints used to assess treatment effects. We propose a multistate model that harmonizes heterogeneous endpoints and differing lengths of follow-up within and between trials.

ResultsThere are currently, March 27, 2020, 23 registered interventional trials investigating the potential benefits of Remdesivir, Lopinavir/ritonavir and Hydroxychloroquine. The endpoints are highly heterogeneous. Follow-up for the primary endpoints ranges from four to 168 days.

A detailed precisely defined endpoint has been proposed by the global network REMAP-CAP, which is specialized on community-acquired pneumonia. Their seven-category endpoint accounts for major clinical events informative for all decision-makers. Moreover, the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative is currently working on a core outcome set. We propose a multistate model that accommodates analysis of these recommended endpoints. The model allows for a detailed investigation of treatment effects for various endpoints over the course of time thereby harmonizing differing endpoints and lengths of follow-up.

ConclusionMultistate model analysis is a powerful tool to study clinically heterogeneous endpoints (mortality, discharge) as well as endpoints influencing hospital capacities (duration of hospitalization and ventilation) simultaneously over time. Our proposed model extracts all information available in the data and is - by harmonizing endpoints within and between trials - a step towards faster decision making. All ongoing clinical trials, especially those with severe cases, should accommodate primary analysis with a stacked probability plot of the major events mechanical ventilation, discharge alive and death.","Von Cube, M.; Grodd, M.; Wolkewitz, M.; Hazard, D.; Lambert, J.",2020-04-03,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.31.20049007,1,Maja Von Cube,"Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center - University of",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20049007v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20049007v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1097/CCM.0000000000004741
5365,Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is associated with a high risk of mortality in critical COVID-19 patients receiving heparin-involved treatment,"BackgroundCoronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) has developed into a global pandemic. It is essential to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and uncover potential risk factors for severe disease to reduce the overall mortality rate of COVID-19.

MethodsSixty-one critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 93 severe non-ICU patients at Huoshenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China) were included in this study. Medical records, including demographic, platelet counts, heparin-involved treatments, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia-(HIT) related laboratory tests, and fatal outcomes of COVID-19 patients were analyzed and compared between survivors and nonsurvivors.

FindingsSixty-one critical COVID-19 patients treated in ICU included 15 survivors and 46 nonsurvivors. Forty-one percent of them (25/61) had severe thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count (PLT) less than 50x109/L, of whom 76% (19/25) had a platelet decrease of >50% compared to baseline; 96% of these patients (24/25) had a fatal outcome. Among the 46 nonsurvivors, 52{middle dot}2% (24/46) had severe thrombocytopenia, compared to 6{middle dot}7% (1/15) among survivors. Moreover, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) could induce a significant decrease in PLT in 81{middle dot}3% of critical CRRT patients (13/16), resulting in a fatal outcome. In addition, a high level of anti-heparin-PF4 antibodies, a marker of HIT, was observed in most ICU patients. Surprisingly, HIT occurred not only in patients with heparin exposure, such as CRRT, but also in heparin-naive patients, suggesting that spontaneous HIT may occur in COVID-19.

InterpretationAnti-heparin-PF4 antibodies are induced in critical COVID-19 patients, resulting in a progressive platelet decrease. Exposure to a high dose of heparin may trigger further severe thrombocytopenia with a fatal outcome. An alternative anticoagulant other than heparin should be used to treat COVID-19 patients in critical condition.

3903,Recent update on COVID-19 in India: Is locking down the country enough?,"BackgroundIndia is the second-largest population in the world, and it is not well equipped, hitherto, in the scenario of the global pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 could impart a devastating impact on the Indian population. Only way to respond against this critical condition is by practicing large-scale social distancing. India lock down for 21 days, however, till 7 April 2020, SARS- CoV-2 positive cases were growing exponentially, which raises the concerns if the number of reported and actual cases are similar.

MethodsWe use Lasso Regression with  = 0.12 and Polynomial features of degree 2 to predict the growth factor. Also, we predicted Logistic curve using the Prophet Python. Further, using the growth rate to logistic, and carrying capacity is 20000 allowed us to calculate the maximum cases and new cases per day.

ResultsWe found the predicted growth factor with a standard deviation of 0.3443 for the upcoming days. When the growth factor becomes 1.0, which is known as Inflection point, it will be safe to state that the rate is no longer exponential. The estimated time to reach the inflection point is between 15-20 April. At that time, the estimated number of total positive cases will be over 12500, if lockdown remains continue.

ConclusionsOur analysis suggests that there is an urgent need to take action to extend the period of lockdown and allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. Otherwise, the outbreak in India can reach the level of the USA or Italy or could be worse than these countries within a few days or weeks, given the size of the population and lack of resources.","Singh Virk, J.; Ali, S.

2154,Hypokalemia and Clinical Implications in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),"BACKGROUNDSARS-CoV-2 has caused a series of COVID-19 globally. SARS-CoV-2 binds angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and causes prevalent hypokalemia

METHODSThe patients with COVID-19 were classified into severe hypokalemia, hypokalemia, and normokalemia group. The study aimed to determine the relationship between hypokalemia and clinical features, the underlying causes and clinical implications of hypokalemia.

RESULTSBy Feb 15, 2020, 175 patients with COVID-19 (92 women and 83 men; median age, 46 [IQR, 34-54] years) were admitted to hospital in Wenzhou, China, consisting 39 severe hypokalemia-, 69 hypokalemia-, and 67 normokalemia patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not associated with hypokalemia among 108 hypokalemia patients (P > 0.05). Body temperature, CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP were significantly associated with the severity of hypokalemia (P<0.01). 93% of severe and critically ill patients had hypokalemia which was most common among elevated CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP. Urine K+ loss was the primary cause of hypokalemia. 1 severe hypokalemia patients was given 3 g/day, adding up to an average of 34 (SD=4) g potassium during hospital stay. The exciting finding was that patients responded well to K+ supplements when they were inclined to recovery.

CONCLUSIONSHypokalemia is prevailing in patients with COVID-19. The correction of hypokalemia is challenging because of continuous renal K+ loss resulting from the degradation of ACE2. The end of urine K+ loss indicates a good prognosis and may be a reliable, in-time, and sensitive biomarker directly reflecting the end of adverse effect on RAS system.","Chen, D.; Li, X.; Song, Q.; Hu, C.; Su, F.; Dai, J.",2020-02-29,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.02.27.20028530,1,Qifa Song Sr.,"Department of Microbiology, Ningbo Municipal Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Ningbo, Zhej",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028530v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028530v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
3966,Modeling layered non-pharmaceutical interventions against SARS-CoV-2 in the United States with Corvid,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThe novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread across the globe and is poised to cause millions of deaths worldwide. There are currently no proven pharmaceutical treatments, and vaccines are likely over a year away. At present, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are the only effective option to reduce transmission of the virus, but it is not clear how to deploy these potentially expensive and disruptive measures. Modeling can be used to understand the potential effectiveness of NPIs for both suppression and mitigation efforts.

Methods and FindingsWe developed Corvid, an adaptation of the agent-based influenza model called FluTE to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. To demonstrate features of the model relevant for studying the effects of NPIs, we simulated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a synthetic population representing a metropolitan area in the United States. Transmission in the model occurs in several settings, including at home, at work, and in schools. We simulated several combinations of NPIs that targeted transmission in these settings, such as school closures and work-from-home policies. We also simulated three strategies for testing and isolating symptomatic cases. For our demonstration parameters, we show that testing followed by home isolation of ascertained cases reduced transmission by a modest amount. We also show how further reductions may follow by isolating cases in safe facilities away from susceptible family members or by quarantining all family members to prevent transmission from likely infections that have yet to manifest.

ConclusionsModels that explicitly include settings where individuals interact such as the home, work, and school are useful for studying the effectiveness of NPIs, as these are more dependent on community structure than pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccination. Corvid can be used to help evaluate complex combinations of interventions, although there is no substitute for real-world observations. Our results on NPI effectiveness summarize the behavior of the model for an assumed set of parameters for demonstration purposes. Model results can be sensitive to the assumptions made about disease transmission and the natural history of the disease, both of which are not yet sufficiently characterized for SARS-CoV-2 for quantitative modeling. Models of SARS-CoV-2 transmission will need to be updated as the pathogen becomes better-understood.","Chao, D. L.; Oron, A.

21053,Modeling the asymptomatic prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy and the ISTAT survey,"objectivesAugust 3rd, 2020, the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) presented preliminary results of seroprevalence survey on the percentage of individuals affected by Covid-19. The survey aims to define (within the entire population of Italy) the portion of individuals that developed an antibody response against SARS-CoV-2. For the first time one has an estimate of the asymptomatic infected population and the possibility to acknowledge its potential role in the infection spread in Italy, one of the most affected areas in Europe. The information obtained allow a particularly sensitive validation of epidemiological models which include the asymptomatic class.

methodsThe present study is devoted to the construction of a model able to simulate, in a systematic way, the asymptomatic group whose relevance in the, SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, has been recently investigated and discussed. The investigation involves the description of the first epidemic outbreak in Italy as well as the predictive analysis of the ongoing second wave. In particular the possible correction to the data of the serological tests because of their sensitivity and specificity.

resultsThe model: taken as an example of the models presently used, satisfactory reproduces the data of the ISTAT survey showing a relevant predictive power and relegating in a secondary position models which do not include, in the simulation, the presence of asymptomatic groups. The corrections due to the serological test sensitivity (in particular those ones depending on the symptoms onset) make the comparison between data and models less accurate.

conclusionsThe predictions of the model confirm a relevant presence of asymptomatic individuals also during the second pandemic wave in Italy. The ratio of reported to unreported cases is predicted to be roughly 1:4. A more detailed knowledge of the results of the survey could allow to correct, in a relevant way, the data by means of the experimental evidences on the antibodies sensibility. The model analyses of the vaccination strategies, confirms the relevance of a massive administration with the beginning of the year to arrive at the end of the infection within August 2021.","Traini, M.

18360,The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests in the view of large-scale testing,"ObjectivesAntigen tests have recently emerged as an interesting alternative to SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic PCR, thought to be valuable especially for the screening of bigger communities. To check appropriateness of the antigen based testing, we determined sensitivity of two point-of-care antigen tests when applied to a cohort of COVID-19 symptomatic, COVID-19 asymptomatic and healthy persons.

MethodsWe examined nasopharyngeal swabs with antigen test 1 (Panbio Covid-19 Ag Rapid Test, Abbott) and antigen test 2 (Standard F Covid-19 Ag FIA, SD Biosensor). An additional nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab of the same individual was checked with PCR (Allplex SARS-nCoV-2, Seegene). Within a 4-day period in October 2020, we collected specimens from 591 subjects. Of them, 290 had COVID-19 associated symptoms.

ResultsWhile PCR positivity was detected in 223 cases, antigen test 1 and antigen test 2 were found positive in 148 (sensitivity 0.664, 95% CI 0.599 - 0.722) and 141 (sensitivity 0.623, 95% CI 0.558 - 0.684) patients, respectively. When only symptomatic patients were analysed, sensitivity increased to 0.738 (95% CI 0.667 - 0.799) for the antigen test 1 and to 0.685 (95% CI 0.611 - 0.750) for the antigen test 2. The substantial drop in sensitivity to 12.9% (95% CI 0.067 - 0.234) was observed for samples with the PCR threshold cycle above > 30.

ConclusionsLow sensitivity of antigen tests leads to the considerable risk of false negativity. It is advisable to implement repeated testing with high enough frequency if the antigen test is used as a frontline screening tool.","Drevinek, P.; Hurych, J.; Kepka, Z.; Briksi, A.; Kulich, M.; Zajac, M.; Hubacek, P.",2020-11-24,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.11.23.20237198,1,Pavel Drevinek,"2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.23.20237198v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.23.20237198v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
12646,"Early transmission dynamics, spread, and genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 in Panama.","BackgroundWith more than 50000 accumulated cases, Panama has one of the highest incidences of SARS-CoV-2 in Central America, despite the fast implementation of disease control strategies. We investigated the early transmission patterns of the virus and the outcomes of mitigation measures in the country.

MethodsWe collected information from epidemiological surveillance, including contact tracing, and genetic data from SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes, of the first five weeks of the outbreak. These data were used to estimate the exponential growth rate, doubling time and the time-varying effective reproductive number (Rt) using date of symptom onset in a Bayesian framework. The time of most recent ancestor for the introduced and circulating lineages was estimated by Bayesian analysis.

FindingsA total of 4210 subjects were SARS-CoV-2 positive during the period evaluated, of them we sequenced 313 cases, detecting the circulation of 10 SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Whole genomes analysis identified the local transmission of one cryptic lineage as early as 2 weeks before it was detected by surveillance systems. Analysis of transmission dynamics showed that lockdown reduced Rt and increased the doubling time, however, these measures did not stop the circulation of this lineage in the country.

InterpretationThese results demonstrate the value of epidemiological modeling and genome surveillance to assess mitigation strategies. At the same time, an active search for cryptic transmission clusters is crucial to interrupt local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a region.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn May 2020, we searched for published studies in PubMed and web of Science related to genetic variability and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Latin America, and there was none. On July 2020, there was one study of this type on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Brazil and none in Central America. We were particularly interested in SARS-CoV-2 cryptic transmission that could allow the virus spread through locals without being detected by respiratory health system surveillance, and no publication was reported. On July 2020, seven papers (five in preprint) were about SARS-CoV-2 cryptic transmission, one in China, another in UK and five in the US. None in Central America. All of them showed the importance of genomic surveillance to detect different lineage introductions, cryptic transmission and its role in early spread in a region or in health-care setting.

Added value of this studyWe integrate data collected from tested individual during national surveillance of COVID19 suspected cases or contact of cases, as part of the National COVID19 Laboratory network. This data was used to estimate epidemiological parameters of the outbreak as well as the effect of mitigation measures on the epidemic dynamic. We sequence the whole genome of SARS-COV-2 of 7.4% of RT-PCR confirmed cases at the national level, and with phylogenetic analysis we identified SARS-CoV-2 lineages introduced in the country and estimate date of their introductions. Epidemiological and genetic data was compared and we observed the cryptic transmission of one introduced lineage and the rise of a local lineage that was not detected by the active contact tracing implemented by the health system surveillance. This cryptic lineage could explain the fact that early implementation measures decreased the transmission rate and the increased the doubling time, however they were not able to eliminate totally the virus spread.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis is the first study that analyzed the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the early COVID19 epidemic in a Central American country using both epidemiological and genomic surveillance. Our findings suggest that strict containment measures and movement restrictions in Panama might have contributed to decrease the early spread of the virus, but that cryptic local transmission allowed a continual basal virus diffusion that could explain, in part, the high incidence of cases in the country. More broadly, our findings are crucial to inform intervention policy in real-time, for countries in similar situations and the importance of constant monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 lineages to understand its transmission in a region.","Franco, D.; Gonzalez, C.; Abrego, L.

9046,Optimal Control Measures to Combat COVID19 Spread in Sri Lanka: A Mathematical ModelConsidering the Heterogeneity of Cases,"The COVID 19 pandemic caused by the novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) has been one of the major public health concerns across the globe, currently more than 3.5 million individuals have been infected, and the number of deaths has passed 250,000. The world wide burden of the disease has been massive, and the governments are in dilemma to protect the health system of the country while safeguarding the economy. There is no vaccine or antivirus drug found against this virus while multiple research groups are actively working on a suitable candidate. The only available mode of minimizing the disease burden has been to control its transmission among the population. Since the occurrence of first COVID 19 local case on 11 March 2020, the government of Sri Lanka introduced serious social distancing and public health interventions in its fullest capacity as a developing nation to effectively combat with the disease spread. This study focuses to develop a mathematical model to investigate the dynamic of this novel disease using an extended version of an SEIR compartmental structure considering the heterogeneity of cases such as asymptomatic, symptomatic with mild indications and the cases required intensive care treatments. All the measures and interventions are in progress with a significantly large social and economic cost, thus, optimal control techniques are used to identify the most appropriate strategies to minimize this cost. The results of the simulations prove that optimal control measures can be worked out as the epidemic curves are flattened while delaying the outbreak so that the health system might not be under pressure to treat and care the patients.","Wickramaarachchi, T.; Perera, S.",2020-06-05,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.04.20122382,1,Tharindu Wickramaarachchi Sr.,The Open University of sri Lanka,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.04.20122382v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.04.20122382v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
19789,MHC Haplotyping of SARS-CoV-2 patients: HLA subtypes are not associated with the presence and severity of Covid-19 in the Israeli population,"HLA haplotypes were found to be associated with increased risk for viral infections or disease severity in various diseases, including SARS. Several genetic variants are associated with Covid-19 severity. However, no clear association between HLA and Covid-19 incidence or severity has been reported. We conducted a large scale HLA analysis of Israeli individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR. Overall, 72,912 individuals with known HLA haplotypes were included in the study, of whom 6,413 (8.8%) were found to have SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. a Total of 20,937 subjects were of Ashkenazi origin (at least 2/4 grandparents). One hundred eighty-one patients (2.8% of the infected) were hospitalized due to the disease. None of the 66 most common HLA loci (within the five HLA subgroups; A, B, C, DQB1, DRB1) was found to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or hospitalization. Similarly, no association was detected in the Ashkenazi Jewish subset. Moreover, no association was found between heterozygosity in any of the HLA loci and either infection or hospitalization.

We conclude that HLA haplotypes are not a major risk/protecting factor among the Israeli population for SARS-CoV-2 infection or severity.","Ben-Shachar, S.; Barda, N.; Manor, S.

A numerical (SEIR) model was then developed to predict the spread of Covid19 in Northamptonshire.

MethodsA combined approach using statistically-weighted data to fit the start of the epidemic to the mortality record. Parameter estimates were then derived for the transmission rate and basic reproduction number.

ResultsAge standardised mortality rates are highest in Northampton (urban) and lowest in semi-rural districts. Northamptonshire has a statistically higher Covid-19 mortality rate than for the East Midlands and England as a whole. Model outputs suggest the number of infected individuals exceed official estimates, meaning less than 40% of the population may require immunisation.

ConclusionsCombining published (sub-regional) mortality rate data with deterministic models on disease spread has the potential to help public health practitioners develop bespoke mitigations, guided by local population demographics.","Petford, N.; Campbell, J.",2020-08-02,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.30.20165399,1,Nick Petford,University of Northampton,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.20165399v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.20165399v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
2667,"Transmissibility of 2019 Novel Coronavirus: zoonotic vs. human to human transmission, China, 2019-2020","ObjectivesThe novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating from Wuhan has rapidly spread throughout China. While the origin of the outbreak remains uncertain, accumulating evidence links a wet market in Wuhan for the early spread of 2019-nCoV. Similarly, the influence of the marketplace on the early transmission dynamics is yet to be investigated.

MethodsUsing the daily series of 2019-nCov incidenceincluding contact history with the market, we have conducted quantitative modeling analyses to estimate the reproduction numbers (R) for the market-to-human and human-to-human transmission together with the reporting probability and the early effects of public health interventions.

ResultsOur mean R estimates for China in 2019-2020 are estimated at 0.37 (95%CrI: 0.02-1.78) for market-to-human transmission, and 3.87 (95%CrI: 3.18-4.78) for human-to-human transmission, respectively. Moreover we estimated that the reporting rate cases stemming from market-to-human transmission was 3-31 fold higher than that for cases stemming from human-to-human transmission, suggesting that contact history with the wet market played a key role in identifying 2019-nCov cases.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest that the proportions of asymptomatic and subclinical patients constitute a substantial component of the epidemics magnitude. Findings suggest that the development of rapid diagnostic tests could help bring the epidemic more rapidly under control.","Mizumoto, K.; Kagaya, K.; Chowell, G.",2020-03-20,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.16.20037036,1,Kenji Mizumoto,Kyoto University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037036v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037036v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
16965,"Low serum vitamin D level and COVID-19 infection and outcomes, a multivariate meta-analysis","ObjectiveThis study aimed to determine whether serum vitamin D is independently associated with COVID-19 infection and outcomes in patients with COVID-19.

MethodsWe identified relevant studies by searching the PubMed, Embase, and medRxiv databases from December 2019 to October 1, 2020. Odds ratios (ORs) were pooled using random-effects models. Only reports with multivariate adjusted results were included to avoid the impact of potential confounding factors.

ResultsA total of six studies with 377,265 patients were identified. Overall, in the categorical analysis, a low serum vitamin D level was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.09- 1.97, I2=81%), hospitalization (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.22-2.74, I2=0%), but not in-hospital death (OR: 2.73, 95% CI: 0.27-27.61). Notably, when vitamin D level was analyzed as a continuous variable, each 5 ng/ml increase in vitamin D level was not associated with any increased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.96-1.12, I2=74%) or in-hospital death (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.93-1.12).

ConclusionsLow serum vitamin D is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection and hospitalization. In-hospital death showed a tendency to be increased in COVID-19 patients with low vitamin D levels. The ongoing clinical trials for evaluation of vitamin D supplementation will be key to the validation of this adjunctive treatment for COVID-19 patients.","Chen, J.; Xie, L.; Yuan, P.; Yu, P.; Ma, J.; Zheng, C.; Liu, X.",2020-10-27,Cardiovascular Medicine,10.1101/2020.10.24.20218974,1,Xiao Liu,Second affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.24.20218974v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.24.20218974v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
1824,When will the battle against novel coronavirus end in Wuhan: a SEIR modeling analysis,"Recent outbreak of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan raised serious public health concerns. By February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, the total number of confirmed infection cases has reached 37,914, and the number of deaths has reached 1123, accounting for 56.9% of the total confirmed cases and 73.7% of the total deaths in China. People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when peoples work and life will be on the right track. In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method. The optimal parameters were estimated as R0=1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47),TI=14 (interquartile range: 14-14) and TE=3.0 (interquartile range: 2.8-3.1). Based on these parameters, the number of infected individuals in Wuhan city may reach the peak around February 19 at about 45,000 people. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and end around the late March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200,000 will not increase. If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed. It was expected that the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March.","Zhang, L.; Wan, K.; Chen, J.; Lu, C.; Dong, L.; Wu, Z.",2020-02-18,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.02.16.20023804,1,Lianglu Zhang Sr.,"Wuhan Ammunition Life-Tech Co., Ltd.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023804v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023804v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.7189/jogh.10.011002

Less attention has been paid to the spread of respiratory droplets in outdoor environments under microclimatologic turbulent wind and which is of growing importance given the current COVID-19 epidemic. We implement a computational model describing a sneezing person in an urban scenario under a medium intensity climatological wind. Turbulence was described with a wall-modeled Large Eddy Simulation model and the spread of respiratory droplets by using a lagrangian approach. Results show the spread of respiratory droplets is characterized by the dynamics of two groups of droplets of different sizes: larger droplets (400 - 900 m) are spread between 2-5 m during 2.3 s while smaller (100 - 200 m) droplets are transported a larger range between 8-11 m by the action of the turbulent wind in 14.1 s average.

To identify nonspecific blood tests and risk factors as predictors of hospitalization due to COVID-19, one has to exclude noisy predictors by comparing the concordance statistics (AUC) for positive and negative cases of SARS-CoV-2 (acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Predictors with significant AUC at negative stratum should be either controlled for their confounders or eliminated (when confounders are unavailable). Models were classified according to the difference of AUC between strata. The framework was applied to an open database with 5644 patients from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Brazil with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction) exam. C-reactive Protein (CRP) was a noisy predictor: hospitalization could have happen due to causes other than COVID-19 even when SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR is positive and CRP is reactive, as most cases are asymptomatic to mild. Candidates of characteristic response from moderate to severe inflammation of COVID-19 were: combinations of eosinophils, monocytes and neutrophils, with age as risk factor; and creatinine, as risk factor, sharpens the odds ratio of the model with monocytes, neutrophils, and age.","Ishikawa, G.; Argenti, G.; Fadel, C.

15733,Measuring the missing: greater racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 burden after accounting for missing race/ethnicity data,"Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous persons in the United States have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and death from COVID-19, due to persistent social inequities. The magnitude of the disparity is unclear, however, because race/ethnicity information is often missing in surveillance data. In this study, we quantified the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and case fatality rates in an urban county by racial/ethnic group using combined race/ethnicity imputation and quantitative bias-adjustment for misclassification. After bias-adjustment, the magnitude of the absolute racial/ethnic disparity, measured as the difference in infection rates between classified Black and Hispanic persons compared to classified White persons, increased 1.3-fold and 1.6-fold respectively. These results highlight that complete case analyses may underestimate absolute disparities in infection rates. Collecting race/ethnicity information at time of testing is optimal. However, when data are missing, combined imputation and bias-adjustment improves estimates of the racial/ethnic disparities in the COVID-19 burden.","Labgold, K.; Hamid, S.; Shah, S.; Gandhi, N.

18381,"How closely is COVID-19 related to HCoV, SARS, and MERS? : Clinical comparison of coronavirus infections and identification of risk factors influencing the COVID-19 severity using common data model (CDM)","BackgroundSouth Korea was one of the epicenters for both the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and 2019 COVID-19 outbreaks. However, there has been a lack of published literature, especially using the Electronic Medical Records (EMR), that provides a comparative summary of the prognostic factors present in the coronavirus-derived diseases. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the distinct clinical traits between the infected patients of different coronaviruses to observe the extent of resemblance within the clinical features and to identify unique factors by disease severity that may influence the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe utilized the common data model (CDM), which is the database that houses the standardized EMR. We set COVID-19 as a reference group in comparative analyses. For statistical methods, we used Levenes test, one-way Anova test, Scheffe post-hoc test, Games-howell post-hoc test, and Students t-test for continuous variables, and chi-squared test and Fishers exact test for categorical variables. With the variables that reflected similarity in more than two comparisons between the disease groups yet significantly different between the COVID-19 severity groups, we performed univariate logistic regression to identify which common manifestations in coronaviruses are risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes.

FindingsWe collected the records of 2840 COVID-19 patients, 67 MERS patients (several suspected cases included), 43 SARS suspected patients, and 87 HCoV patients. We found that a significantly higher number of COVID-19 patients had been diagnosed with comorbidities compared to the MERS and HCoV groups (48.5% vs. 10.4 %, p < 0.001 and 48.5% vs. 35.6%, p < 0.05) and also that the non-mild COVID-19 patients reported more comorbidities than the mild group (55.7% vs. 47.8%, p < 0.05). There were overall increases in the levels of fibrinogen in both sets of disease and severity groups. The univariate logistic regression showed that the male sex (OR: 1.66; CI: 1.29-2.13, p < 0.001), blood type A (OR: 1.80; CI: 1.40-2.31, p < 0.001), renal disease (OR: 3.27; CI: 2.34-4.55, p < 0.001), decreased creatinine level (OR: 2.05; CI: 1.45-2.88, p < 0.001), and elevated fibrinogen level (OR: 1.59, CI: 1.21-2.09, p < 0.001) are associated with the severe COVID-19 prognosis, whereas the patients reporting gastrointestinal symptoms (OR: 0.42; CI: 0.23-0.72, p < 0.01) and increased alkaline phosphatase (OR: 0.73; CI: 0.56-0.94, p < 0.05) are more less likely to experience complications and other severe outcomes from the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

InterpretationThe present study observed the highest resemblance between the COVID-19 and SARS groups as clinical manifestations that were present in SARS group were linked to the severity of COVID-19. In particular, male individuals with blood type A and previous diagnosis of kidney failure were shown to be more susceptible to developing the poorer outcomes during COVID-19 infection, with a presentation of elevated level of fibrinogen.","Kim, Y.

16155,Clinical characteristics and outcomes of adult patients admitted with COVID-19 in East London: a retrospective cohort analysis,"BackgroundDescriptions of clinical characteristics of patients hospitalised with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), their clinical course and short-term in- and outpatient outcomes in deprived urban populations in the United Kingdom are still relatively sparse. We describe the epidemiology, clinical course, experience of non-invasive ventilation and intensive care, mortality and short-term sequalae of patients admitted to two large District General Hospitals across a large East London NHS Trust during the first wave of the pandemic.

MethodsA retrospective analysis was carried out on a cohort of 1,946 patients with a clinical or laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, including descriptive statistics and survival analysis. A more detailed analysis was undertaken of a subset of patients admitted across three Respiratory Units in the trust.

ResultsIncreasing age, male sex and Asian ethnicity were associated with worse outcomes. Increasing severity of chest X-ray abnormalities trended with mortality. Radiological changes persisted in over 50% of cases at early follow up (6 weeks). Ongoing symptoms including hair loss, memory impairment, breathlessness, cough and fatigue were reported in 67% of survivors, with 42% of patients unable to return to work due to ongoing symptoms.

ConclusionsUnderstanding the acute clinical features, course of illness and outcomes of COVID-19 will be vital in preparing for further peaks of the pandemic. Our initial follow up data suggest there are ongoing sequalae of COVID-19 including persistent symptoms and radiological abnormalities. Further data, including longer term follow up data, are necessary to improve our understanding of this novel pathogen and associated disease.

Section 1: What is already known on this topicPrevious studies have reported that increasing age, male sex, Black and Asian ethnicity increased risk of death for patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is little published literature regarding the follow up of patients with COVID-19.

Section 2: What this study addsOur study is one of the first with follow up data for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. We show that radiological abnormality persisted at 6 weeks in over 50% of patients, as well as significantly increased breathlessness in patients without baseline dyspnoea. Our study confirms that increasing age, male sex and Asian ethnicity increased risk of death for patients, but also in an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population in East London.","Cheng, D.; Calderwood, C.; Skyllberg, E.; Ainley, A.",2020-10-11,Respiratory Medicine,10.1101/2020.10.08.20193623,1,Adam Ainley,"Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.08.20193623v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.08.20193623v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
6577,"Rapidly Measuring Spatial Accessibility of COVID-19 Healthcare Resources: A Case Study of Illinois, USA","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has infected millions of people and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. While COVID-19 has overwhelmed healthcare resources (e.g., healthcare personnel, testing resources, hospital beds, and ventilators) in a number of countries, limited research has been conducted to understand spatial accessibility of such resources. This study fills this gap by rapidly measuring the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources with a particular focus on Illinois, USA. Specifically, the rapid measurement is achieved by resolving computational intensity of an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method through a parallel computing strategy based on cyberGIS (cyber geographic information science and systems). The study compared the spatial accessibility measures for COVID-19 patients to those of general population, identifying which geographic areas need additional healthcare resources to improve access. The results also help delineate the areas that may face a COVID-19-induced shortage of healthcare resources caused by COVID-19. The Chicagoland, particularly the southern Chicago, shows an additional need for resources. Our findings are relevant for policymakers and public health practitioners to allocate existing healthcare resources or distribute new resources for maximum access to health services.","Kang, J.-Y.; Michels, A.

Here, we developed and validated chest CT-based imaging biomarkers for COVID-19 patient screening. We identified the vasculature-like signals from CT images and found that, compared to healthy and community acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients, the COVID-19 patients revealed significantly higher abundance of these signals. Furthermore, unsupervised feature learning leads to the discovery of clinical-relevant imaging biomarkers from the vasculature-like signals for accurate and sensitive COVID-19 screening that has been double-blindly validated in an independent hospital (sensitivity: 0.941, specificity: 0.904, AUC: 0.952).

8052,Knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 in Bangladesh: Population-level estimation and a comparison of data obtained by phone and online survey methods,"Peoples adherence to the guidelines and measures suggested in fighting the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is partly determined by the Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices (KAP) of the population. In this cross-sectional study, we primarily addressed two key issues. First, we tried to determine whether there is a significant difference in the estimated COVID-19 knowledge level from the online and phone survey methods. Second, we tried to quantify the knowledge and attitude of COVID-19 in Bangladeshi adult population. Data were collected through phone calls (April 14-23, 2020) and online survey (April 18-19, 2020) in Bangladesh. The questionnaire had 20 knowledge questions with each correct response getting one point and incorrect/dont know response getting no point (maximum total knowledge score 20). Participants scoring >17 were categorized as having good knowledge. The percentages of good knowledge holders were 57.6%, 75.1%, and 95.8% in the phone (n=1426), online non-medical (n=1097), and online medical participants (n=382), respectively. Comparison between phone and online survey showed that, overall, online survey might overestimate knowledge level than that of phone survey, although there was no difference for elderly, poor, and rural people. Male gender, higher education, living in town/urban areas, good financial condition, and use of internet were positively associated with good knowledge. However, higher knowledge was associated with having less confidence in the final control of COVID-19. Our adult population-level estimates showed that only 32.6% (95% CI 30.1-35.2%) had good knowledge. This study provides crucial information that could be useful for the researchers and policymakers to develop effective strategies.","Karim, A.; Akter, M.; Mazid, A. T.; Pulock, O. S.; Aziz, T.

We analyzed test results across specimen types and for individuals with multiple same-day and multi-day collected specimens. Nasopharyngeal compared to throat swabs had a higher positivity (8.8% vs. 4.8%) and an adjusted estimate 2.9 Ct lower (SE=0.5, p<0.001). Same-day specimens showed high concordance (98.8%), and the median Ct of multi-day specimens increased over time. Symptomatic cases had rRT-PCR results with an adjusted estimate 3.0 Ct (SE=0.5, p<0.001) lower than asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic cases.

MethodsCross-sectional online survey of 1,034 U.S. residents age 18+ conducted on March 17, 2020.

ResultsFor every point increase in knowledge, the odds of participation in purchasing more goods (OR=0.88, 95% CI:0.81-0.95), attending large gatherings (OR=0.87, 95%CI: 0.81-0.93), and using medical masks (OR=0.56, 95% CI:0.50-0.62) decreased by 12%, 13%, and 44%, respectively. Gen X and Millennial participants had 56% to 76% higher odds, respectively, of increased purchasing behavior, compared to Baby Boomers. Results suggest politicization of response recommendations. Democrats had 30% lower odds of attending large gatherings (OR=0.70, 95% CI:0.50-0.97), and 48% lower odds of using medical masks (OR=0.52, 95% CI:0.34-0.78), compared to Republicans.

ConclusionsThis survey is one of the first attempts to study determinants of knowledge and behaviors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. A national, coordinated effort at pandemic response may ensure better compliance with behavioral recommendations to address this public health emergency.","Clements, J.

AimTo evaluate a nurse-led Enhanced Care Home Team (ECHT) enhanced SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy.

Design and settingService evaluation in care homes in Norfolk UK.

MethodResidents and staff received nose and throat swab tests (7 April to 29 June 2020). Resident test results were linked with symptoms on days 0-14 after test and mortality to 13 July 2020.

ResultsResidents (n=518) in 44 homes and staff (n=340) in 10 care homes were tested. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was identified in 103 residents in 14 homes and 49 staff in seven homes. Of 103 SARS-CoV-2+ residents, just 38 had typical symptom(s) at time of test (new cough and/or fever). Amongst 54 residents who were completely asymptomatic when tested, 12 (22%) developed symptoms within 14 days. Compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative residents, SARS-CoV-2+ residents were more likely to exhibit typical symptoms (new cough (n=26, p=0.001); fever (n=24, p=<0.001)) or as  generally unwell (n=18, p=0.001).

Of 38 resident deaths, 21 (55%) were initially attributed to SARS-CoV-2, all of whom tested SARS-CoV-2+. One death not initially attributed to SARS-CoV-2 also tested positive.

ConclusionTesting identified asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2+ residents and staff. Being  generally unwell was common amongst symptomatic residents and may indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection in older people in the absence of more  typical symptoms. Where a resident appears generally unwell SARS-CoV-2-infection should be suspected. Protocols for testing involved integrated health and social care teams.","Smith, E.; Aldus, C.

15964,Serological testing in addition to PCR screening for the re-opening of American colleges and universities: potential for cost-savings without compromising pandemic mitigation,"ImportanceThe addition of a serological testing could reduce the overall testing costs of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing reopening plan for colleges/universities in the United States, without compromising the efficacy of the testing plan.

ObjectivesTo determine whether a college/university reopening SARS-CoV-2 testing plan that includes serological testing can be cost-saving compared to a PCR-only testing.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe assessed costs of serological testing in addition to PCR testing under various scenarios of university sizes (2000, 10,000, and 40,000) and epidemic conditions (initial antibody prevalence 2.5-15%; cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence during the school year 5-30%) of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. We estimated total testing costs and relative percentage of cost-savings of different screening (i.e. targeted/ universal) and testing (i.e. in-sourcing/out-sourcing) scenarios between September 2020-May 2021.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresTesting costs of serological testing and PCR testing, Relative percentage of cost saving by including serology testing in addition to PCR testing.

ResultsIncluding baseline serology testing alongside routine regular PCR testing can reduce total test volumes and related costs throughout the school year. While the total testing cost is likely much lower if regular PCR testing is insourced compared to outsourced ($5 million vs $34 million for university size 10,000), including serologic testing could achieve the up to 20% cost-savings relative to PCR testing alone. The insourcing of serological testing when PCR testing is insourced can achieve greater cost-savings under high initial antibody prevalence (>5%) and cumulative incidence throughout the school year (>10%) at medium and large sized universities. If PCR testing is outsourced, however, the inclusion of serological testing becomes always preferred in most university sizes and epidemic conditions.

Conclusions and RelevanceWhile regular PCR testing alone is the preferred strategy for containing epidemics, including serology testing may help achieve cost-savings if outbreaks are anticipated, or if baseline seropositivity is high.

Key Points (96/100)O_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan the addition of a serological testing reduce the overall testing costs of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing reopening plan for universities in the United States?

FindingsThis costing study suggested that inclusion of serological testing in addition to outsourced PCR testing as part of a university re-opening strategy could achieve cost savings of up to 20%. The amount of savings, or additional costs, is dependent on insourcing or outsourcing of testing, epidemic conditions and university size.

MeaningThe relative cost-savings depend strongly on whether PCR and/or serology are being insourced or outsourced, university sizes and cumulative incidence.","Jo, Y.; Singh, R.; Rao, G.; Galea, S.; Nichols, B.

MethodsPCR and serological testing was performed on 394 individuals.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2-IgG seroprevalence was 42.9% (95% CI 38.1%-47.8%), 40.6% (95% CI 35.9%-45.5%), and 42.4% (95% CI 37.6%-47.3%) using the CL-900i, VidasIII, and Elecsys assays, respectively. Between the three assays, overall, positive, and negative percent agreements ranged between 93.2%-95.7%, 89.3%-92.8%, and 93.8%-97.8%, respectively; Cohen kappa statistic ranged from 0.86-0.91; and 35 specimens (8.9%) showed discordant results. Among all individuals, 12.5% (95% CI 9.6%-16.1%) had current infection, as assessed by PCR. Of these, only 34.7% (95% CI 22.9%-48.7%) were seropositive by at least one assay. A total of 216 individuals (54.8%; 95% CI 49.9%-59.7%) had evidence of ever infection using antibody testing and/or PCR during or prior to this study. Of these, only 78.2%, 74.1%, and 77.3% were seropositive in the CL-900i, VidasIII, and Elecsys assays, respectively.

ConclusionsAll three assays had comparable performance and excellent agreement, but missed at least 20% of individuals with past or current infection. Commercial antibody assays can substantially underestimate ever infection, more so when infection rates are high.","Nasrallah, G. K.; Dargham, S. R.; Shurrab, F.; Al-Sadeq, D.

19797,Prognostic and predictive biomarkers in patients with COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab in a randomised controlled trial,"BackgroundRetrospective observational studies suggest that interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, D-dimer, and platelets are associated with disease progression, treatment outcomes, or both, in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. We explored these candidate prognostic and predictive biomarkers with efficacy outcomes after treatment with tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody using data from the COVACTA trial for patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

MethodsCandidate biomarkers were measured in 295 patients in the tocilizumab arm and 142 patients in the placebo arm. Efficacy outcomes assessed were clinical status on a seven-category ordinal scale (1, discharge; 7, death), mortality, time to hospital discharge, and mechanical ventilation (if not receiving it at randomisation) through day 28. Prognostic and predictive biomarkers were evaluated continuously with proportional odds, binomial or Fine-Gray models, and additional sensitivity analyses.

FindingsModelling in the placebo arm showed all candidate biomarkers except LDH and D-dimer were strongly prognostic for day 28 clinical outcomes of mortality, mechanical ventilation, clinical status, and time to hospital discharge. Modelling in the tocilizumab arm showed a predictive value of ferritin for day 28 clinical outcomes of mortality (predictive interaction p=0.03), mechanical ventilation (predictive interaction p=0.01), and clinical status (predictive interaction p=0.02) compared with placebo.

InterpretationMultiple biomarkers prognostic for clinical outcomes were confirmed in COVACTA. Ferritin was identified as a predictive biomarker for the effects of tocilizumab in the COVACTA patient population; high ferritin levels were associated with better clinical outcomes for tocilizumab compared with placebo at day 28.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

Evidence before this studyThe efficacy and safety of the anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab in the treatment of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia was investigated in COVACTA, a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. The primary endpoint of improved clinical status on a seven-category ordinal scale (1, discharged/ready for discharge; 7, death) at day 28 was not met in this trial. Among the secondary endpoints, no difference in mortality at day 28 was observed, but time to hospital discharge was shorter in the tocilizumab group. Subgroup analysis suggested there might be a treatment benefit in patients grouped according to their ordinal scale category at baseline.

We searched PubMed on September 14, 2020, using the terms ""tocilizumab AND (COVID-19 OR coronavirus) AND biomarker"" with no language or date restrictions. The search retrieved 18 articles, four of which identified laboratory measures as potential biomarkers in patients who received tocilizumab for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. The biomarkers reported in these studies include interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen, liver transaminases, lymphocytes, platelets, and D-dimer. However, these previous studies were single-centre, retrospective, observational studies. Larger, prospective, controlled trials are needed to investigate potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers to assess the outcomes and response to treatments for COVID-19.

Added value of this studyThis exploratory analysis of data from COVACTA demonstrated interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, ferritin, neutrophils (percentage and absolute count), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocytes (percentage and absolute count), monocytes (percentage), and platelets as strong prognostic biomarkers in patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. More important, ferritin showed predictive value for tocilizumab treatment effects on day 28 clinical outcomes of mortality, mechanical ventilation (among the subgroup of patients not receiving mechanical ventilation at randomisation), and clinical status compared with placebo.

Implications of all the available evidenceIn patients with elevated levels of ferritin at baseline, tocilizumab decreased the probability of death, mechanical ventilation, and worsening clinical status at day 28 compared with placebo, suggesting that ferritin might be useful as a predictive biomarker of efficacy outcomes for tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.","Tom, J.; Bao, M.; Tsai, L.; Qamra, A.; Summers, D.; Carrasco-Triguero, M.; Mcbride, J.; Rosenberger, C.

19809,Quantifying the online news media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic.,"BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns, mask wearing and social distancing have been the primary measures to effectively combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Such measures are highly effective when there is strong population wide adherence which needs to be facilitated by information on the current risks posed by the pandemic alongside a clear exposition of the rules and guidelines in place. Here we address the issue of communication on the pandemic by offering data and analysis of online news media coverage of COVID-19.

MethodsWe collected 26 million news articles from the front pages of 172 major online news sources in 11 countries (available at http://sciride.org). Using topic detection we identified COVID-19-related content to quantify the proportion of total coverage pandemic received in 2020. Sentiment analysis tool Vader was employed to stratify the emotional polarity of COVID-19 reporting. Further topic detection and sentiment analysis was performed on COVID-19 articles to reveal the leading themes in pandemic reporting and their respective emotional polarizations.

FindingsWe find that COVID-19 coverage accounted for approximately 25% of all front-page online news articles between January and October 2020. Sentiment analysis of English-speaking sources reveals that the overall COVID-19 coverage cannot be simply classified as negative due to the disease subject matter, suggesting a wide heterogeneous reporting of the pandemic. Within this heterogenous coverage, 16% of COVID-19 news articles (or 4% of all English-speaking articles) can be classified as highly negatively polarized, citing issues such as death, fear or crisis.

InterpretationThe goal of pandemic public health communication is to increase understanding of distancing rules and maximize the impact of any governmental policy. Our results suggest an information overload in COVID-19 reporting that could risk obscuring effective policy communication. We hope that our data and analysis will inform health communication strategy to minimize the risks of COVID-19 while vaccination regimes are being introduced.","Krawczyk, K.; Chelkowski, T.; Mishra, S.; Xifara, D.; Gibert, B.; Laydon, D.

4201,Risk Assessment of nCOVID-19 Pandemic In India: A Mathematical Model And Simulation,"The entire world is now eventually locked down due to the outbreak of nCOVID-19 corona virus outbreak. The fast and relentless spread nCOVID-19 has basically segmented the populace only into merely into three classes, such as susceptible, infected and recovered compartments. Adapting the classical SEIR-type epidemic modelling framework, the direct person-to-person contact transmission is taken as the direct route of transmission of nCOVID-19 pandemic. In this research, the authors have developed a model of the nation-wide trends of the outburst of the nCOVID-19 infection using an SEIR Model. The SEIR dynamics are expressed using ordinary differential equations. The creators initially determined the parameters of the model from the accessible day by day information for Indian States dependent on around 35 days history of diseases, recuperations and deaths. The determined parameters have been amassed to extend future patterns for the Indian subcontinent, which is right now at a beginning time in the contamination cycle. The novelty of the study lies in the prediction of both the pessimistic and optimistic mathematical model based comprehensive analysis of nCOVID-19 infection spreading, for two different conditions: (a) if lockdown gets withdrawn and (b) if lockdown continues as a whole. If the complete lockdown in India is withdrawn on 14th April 2020, as a whole, then from the simulation, the authors have predicted that the infected population will flare-up to a large extent, suddenly, however, gradual or zone specific withdrawal would be more effective solution. This study also suggested some possible way-out to get rid of this situation by providing a trade-off between   flattening of the curve"" as well as ""less economic turbulence.

12626,Two Stage Designs for Phase III Trials,"Phase III platform trials are increasingly used to evaluate a sequence of treatments for a specific disease. Traditional approaches to structure such trials tend to focus on the sequential questions rather than the performance of the entire enterprise. We consider two-stage trials where an early evaluation is used to determine whether to continue with an individual study. To evaluate performance, we use the ratio of expected wins (RW), that is, the expected number of reported efficacious treatments using a two-stage approach compared to that using standard phase III trials. We approximate the test statistics during the course of a single trial using Brownian Motion and determine the optimal stage 1 time and type I error rate to maximize RW for fixed power. At times, a surrogate or intermediate endpoint may provide a quicker read on potential efficacy than use of the primary endpoint at stage 1. We generalize our approach to the surrogate endpoint setting and show improved performance, provided a good quality and powerful surrogate is available. We apply our methods to the design of a platform trial to evaluate treatments for COVID-19 disease.","Follmann, D.; Proschan, M.",2020-08-03,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.29.20164525,1,Dean Follmann,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.20164525v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.20164525v1.full.pdf,cc0,NA
5978,Warmer weather and global trends in the coronavirus COVID-19,"Predicting COVID-19 epidemic development in the upcoming warm season has attracted much attention in the hope of providing helps to fight the epidemic. It requires weather (environmental) factors to be included in prediction models, but there are few models to achieve it successfully. In this study, we proposed a new concept of environmental infection rate (RE), based on floating time of respiratory droplets in the air and inactivation rate of virus to solve the problem. More than half of the particles in the droplets can float in the atmosphere for 1-2 hours. The prediction results showed that high RE values (>3.5) are scattered around 30{degrees}N in winter (Dec.-Feb.). As the weather warms, its distribution area expands and extends to higher latitudes of northern hemisphere, reaching its maximum in April, and then shrinking northward. These indicated that the spread of COVID-19 in most parts of the northern hemisphere is expected to decline after Apr., but the risks in high latitudes will remain high in May. In the south of southern hemisphere, the RE values tend to subside from Apr. to July. The high modeled RE values up to July, however, suggested that warmer weather will not stop COVID-19 from spreading. Public health intervention is needed to overcome the outbreak.","Li, H.; Xiao, H.; Zhu, R.; Sun, C.; Liu, C.; Xiao, H.",2020-05-05,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.28.20084004,1,Hongwei Xiao,East China University of Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20084004v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20084004v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
20429,Increased peripheral blood neutrophil activation phenotypes and NETosis in critically ill COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundIncreased inflammation is a hallmark of COVID-19, with pulmonary and systemic inflammation identified in multiple cohorts of patients. Definitive cellular and molecular pathways driving severe forms of this disease remain uncertain. Neutrophils, the most numerous leukocytes in blood circulation, can contribute to immunopathology in infections, inflammatory diseases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Changes in multiple neutrophil functions and circulating cytokine levels over time during COVID-19 may help define disease severity and guide care and decision making.

MethodsBlood was obtained serially from critically ill COVID-19 patients for 11 days. Neutrophil oxidative burst, neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis), phagocytosis and cytokine levels were assessed ex vivo. Lung tissue was obtained immediately post-mortem for immunostaining.

ResultsElevations in neutrophil-associated cytokines IL-8 and IL-6, and general inflammatory cytokines IP-10, GM-CSF, IL-1b, IL-10 and TNF, were identified in COVID-19 plasma both at the first measurement and at multiple timepoints across hospitalization (p < 0.0001). Neutrophils had exaggerated oxidative burst (p < 0.0001), NETosis (p < 0.0001) and phagocytosis (p < 0.0001) relative to controls. Increased NETosis correlated with both leukocytosis and neutrophilia. Neutrophils and NETs were identified within airways and alveoli in the lung parenchyma of 40% of SARS-CoV-2 infected lungs. While elevations in IL-8 and ANC correlated to COVID-19 disease severity, plasma IL-8 levels alone correlated with death.

ConclusionsCirculating neutrophils in COVID-19 exhibit an activated phenotype with increased oxidative burst, NETosis and phagocytosis. Readily accessible and dynamic, plasma IL-8 and circulating neutrophil function may be potential COVID-19 disease biomarkers.","Masso-Silva, J. A.; Moshensky, A.; Lam, M. T.

13117,Mass molecular testing for COVID19 using NGS-based technology and a highly scalable workflow,"Since first reported case of the new coronavirus infection in Wuhan, China, researchers and governments have witnessed an unseen rise in the number of cases. Thanks to the rapid work of Chinese scientists, the pathogen now called SARS-CoV-2 has been identified and its whole genome has been deposited in public databases by early January 2020. The availability of the genome has allowed researchers to develop Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assays, which are now the gold-standard for molecular diagnosis of the respiratory syndrome COVID19. Because of the rising number of cases and rapid spreading, the world has been facing a shortage of RT-PCR supplies, especially the ones involved in RNA extraction. This has been a major bottleneck to increase testing capacity in many countries that do not significantly manufacture these supplies (Brazil included). Additionally, RT-PCR scalability is highly dependent on equipment that usually perform testing of 96 samples at a time. In this work, we describe a cost-effective molecular NGS-based test for diagnosis of COVID19, which uses a single-step RNA extraction and presents high scalability and accuracy when compared to the gold-standard RT-PCR. A single run of the NGS-based test using the Illumina NextSeq 550 mid-end sequencing equipment is able to multiplex 1,536 patients samples, providing individual semi-qualitative results (detected, not detected). Detected results are provided with fragments per million (FPM) values, which was demonstrated to correlate with RT-PCR Cycle Threshold (CT) values. Besides, usage of the high-end Illumina Novaseq platform may yield diagnostic for up to 6,144 samples in a single run. Performance results when compared with RT-PCR show general accuracy of 96% (or 98% when only samples with CT values for gene N lower than 30 are considered). We have also developed an online platform, called VarsVID(R), a Varstation(R) feature, to help test executors to easily scale testing numbers. Sample registering, wet-lab worksheets, sample sheet for sequencing and results display are all features provided by VarsVID(R) on Varstation(R). Altogether, these results will contribute to control COVID19 pandemics.","Malta, F. D. M.; Amgarten, D. E.; Val, F. C.; Santana, R. A. F.; Cervato, M. C.; De Azevedo, B. M. C.; Basqueira, M. D.

12262,COVID-19 induces a hyperactive phenotype in circulating platelets,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has to date affected over 13.3 million globally. Although high rates of venous thromboembolism and evidence of COVID-19-induced endothelial dysfunction have been reported, the precise aetiology of the increased thrombotic risk associated with COVID-19 infection remains to be fully elucidated.

ObjectivesHere, we assessed clinical platelet parameters and circulating platelet activity in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19.

MethodsAn assessment of clinical blood parameters in patients with severe COVID-19 disease (requiring intensive care), patients with non-severe disease (not requiring intensive care), general medical in-patients without COVID-19 and healthy donors was undertaken. Platelet function and activity were also assessed by secretion and specific marker analysis.

ResultsWe show that routine clinical blood parameters including increased MPV and decreased platelet:neutrophil ratio are associated with disease severity in COVID-19 upon hospitalisation and intensive care unit admission. Strikingly, agonist-induced ADP release was dramatically higher in COVID-19 patients compared with non-COVID-19 hospitalized patients and circulating levels of PF4, sP-selectin and TPO were also significantly elevated in COVID-19.

ConclusionDistinct differences exist in routine full blood count and other clinical laboratory parameters between patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. Moreover, we have determined that COVID-19 patients possess hyperactive circulating platelets. These data suggest that abnormal platelet reactivity may contribute to hypercoagulability in COVID-19. Further investigation of platelet function in COVID-19 may provide additional insights into the aetiology of thrombotic risk in this disease and may contribute to the optimisation of thrombosis prevention and treatment strategies.

3064,Containment measures limit environmental effects on COVID-19 early outbreak dynamics,"Environmental factors are well known to affect spatio-temporal patterns of infectious disease outbreaks, but whether the recent rapid spread of COVID-19 across the globe is related to local environmental conditions is highly debated. We assessed the impact of environmental factors (temperature, humidity and air pollution) on the global patterns of COVID-19 early outbreak dynamics during January-May 2020, controlling for several key socio-economic factors and airport connections. We showed that during the earliest phase of the global outbreak (January-March), COVID-19 growth rates were non-linearly related to climate, with fastest spread in regions with a mean temperature of ca. 5{degrees}C, and in the most polluted regions. However, environmental effects faded almost completely when considering later outbreaks, in keeping with the progressive enforcement of containment actions. Accordingly, COVID-19 growth rates consistently decreased with stringent containment actions during both early and late outbreaks. Our findings indicate that environmental drivers may have played a role in explaining the early variation among regions in disease spread. With limited policy interventions, seasonal patterns of disease spread might emerge, with temperate regions of both hemispheres being most at risk of severe outbreaks during colder months. Nevertheless, containment measures play a much stronger role and overwhelm impacts of environmental variation, highlighting the key role for policy interventions in curbing COVID-19 diffusion within a given region. If the disease will become seasonal in the next years, information on environmental drivers of COVID-19 can be integrated with epidemiological models to inform forecasting of future outbreak risks and improve management plans.","Ficetola, G.

In this paper, Beta regression is introduced as a tool to analyze the rate of hospitalization and the proportion of Intensive Care Unit admissions over both hospitalized and diagnosed patients, with the aim of explaining as well as predicting, and thus allowing to better anticipate, the impact on hospital resources during an early-phase epidemic. This is applied to the initial phase COVID-19 pandemic in Spain and its different regions from 20-Feb to 08-Apr of 2020. Spatial and temporal factors are included in the Beta distribution through a precision factor. The model reveals the importance of the lagged data of hospital occupation, as well as the rate of recovered patients. Excellent agreement is found for next-day predictions, while even for multiple-day predictions (up to 12 days), robust results are obtained in most cases in spite of the limited reliability and consistency of the data.","Jannes, G.; Barreal, J.",2020-06-29,Health Economics,10.1101/2020.06.27.20141614,1,Gil Jannes,Complutense University of Madrid,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.27.20141614v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.27.20141614v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
3650,Estimation of the probability of reinfection with COVID-19 coronavirus by the SEIRUS model,"With sensitivity of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test used to detect the presence of the virus in the human host, the global health community has been able to record a great number of recovered population. Therefore, in a bid to answer a burning question of reinfection in the recovered class, the model equations which exhibits the disease-free equilibrium (E0) state for COVID-19 coronavirus was developed in this study and was discovered to both exist as well as satisfy the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability with a basic reproductive number R0 = 0 for and endemic situation. Hence, there is a chance of no secondary reinfections from the recovered population as the rate of incidence of the recovered population vanishes, that is, B = 0.

Furthermore, numerical simulations were carried to complement the analytical results in investigating the effect of the implementation of quarantine and observatory procedures has on the projection of the further spread of the virus globally. Result shows that the proportion of infected population in the absence of curative vaccination will continue to grow globally meanwhile the recovery rate will continue slowly which therefore means that the ratio of infection to recovery rate will determine the death rate that is recorded globally and most significant for this study is the rate of reinfection by the recovered population which will decline to zero over time as the virus is cleared clinically from the system of the recovered class.","Victor, A.

19777,"Genomic characterization of a novel SARS-CoV-2 lineage from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","In this study, we report the sequencing of 180 new viral genomes obtained from different municipalities of the state of Rio de Janeiro from April to December 2020. We identified a novel lineage of SARS-CoV-2, originated from B.1.1.28, distinguished by five single-nucleotide variants (SNVs): C100U, C28253U, G28628U, G28975U, and C29754U. The SNV G23012A (E484K), in the receptor-binding domain of Spike protein, was widely spread across the samples. This mutation was previously associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This novel lineage emerged in late July being first detected by us in late October and still mainly restricted to the capital of the state. However, as observed for other strains it can be rapidly spread in the state. The significant increase in the frequency of this lineage raises concerns about public health management and continuous need for genomic surveillance during the second wave of infections.

8493,Predicting social distancing index during COVID-19 outbreak through online search engines trends,"Online-available information has been considered an accessory tool to estimate epidemiology and collect data on diseases and population behavior patterns. This study aimed to explore the potential use of Google and YouTube relative search volume to predict social distancing index in Brazil during COVID-19 outbreak and verify the correlation between social distancing measures with the course of the epidemic. Data concerning the social distancing index, epidemiological data on COVID-19 in Brazil and the search engines trends for ""Coronavirus"" were retrieved from online databases. Multiple linear regression was performed and resulted in a statistically significant model evidencing that Google and YouTube relative search volumes are predictors of the social distancing index. The Spearman correlation test revealed a weak correlation between social distancing measures and the course of the COVID-19 epidemic.

3612,Facemasks and similar barriers to prevent respiratory illness such asCOVID-19: A rapid systematic review,"The current pandemic of COVID-19 has lead to conflicting opinions on whether wearing facemasks outside of health care facilities protects against the infection. To better understand the value of wearing facemasks we undertook a rapid systematic review of existing scientific evidence about development of respiratory illness, linked to use of facemasks in community settings.

MethodsWe included all study designs. There were 31 eligible studies (including 12 RCTs). Narrative synthesis and random-effects meta-analysis of attack rates for primary and secondary prevention in 28 studies were performed. Results were reported by design, setting and type of face barrier in primary prevention, and by who wore the facemask (index patient or well contacts) in secondary prevention trials. The preferred outcome was influenza-like illness (ILI) but similar outcomes were pooled with ILI when ILI was unavailable. GRADE quality assessment was based on RCTs with support from observational studies.

ResultsWhere specific information was available, most studies reported about use of medical grade (surgical paper masks). In 3 RCTs, wearing a facemask may very slightly reduce the odds of developing ILI/respiratory symptoms, by around 6% (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.19, I 29%, low-certainty evidence). Greater effectiveness was suggested by observational studies. When both house-mates and an infected household member wore facemasks the odds of further household members becoming ill may be modestly reduced by around 19% (OR 0.81, 95%CI 0.48 to 1.37, I 45%, 5 RCTs, low certainty evidence). The protective effect was very small if only the well person (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.28, I 11%, 2 RCTs, low uncertainty evidence) or the infected person wore the facemask (very low certainty evidence).

DiscussionBased on the RCTs we would conclude that wearing facemasks can be very slightly protective against primary infection from casual community contact, and modestly protective against household infections when both infected and uninfected members wear facemasks. However, the RCTs often suffered from poor compliance and controls using facemasks. Across observational studies the evidence in favour of wearing facemasks was stronger. We expect RCTs to under-estimate the protective effect and observational studies to exaggerate it. The evidence is not sufficiently strong to support widespread use of facemasks as a protective measure against COVID-19. However, there is enough evidence to support the use of facemasks for short periods of time by particularly vulnerable individuals when in transient higher risk situations. Further high quality trials are needed to assess when wearing a facemask in the community is most likely to be protective.","Brainard, J.

21061,Point-of-Care CRISPR-Cas-Assisted SARS-CoV-2 Detection in an Automated and Mobile Droplet Magnetofluidic Device,"In the fight against COVID-19, there remains unmet needs in developing point-of-care (POC) diagnostic testing tools that can rapidly and sensitively detect the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus to control disease transmission and improve patient management. Although recent CRISPR-Cas-assisted SARS-CoV-2 detection assays (such as DETECTR and SHERLOCK) are viewed as transformative solutions for POC diagnostic testing, their lack of simple sample processing and full integration within an automated and portable device hamper their potential for POC use. We report herein POC-CRISPR - a new single-step CRISPR-Cas-assisted assay that is coupled to droplet magnetofluidics (DM) - that leverages simple magnetic concentration and transport of nucleic acid-binding magnetic beads to accomplish sample preparation and assay automation. By further adapting the assay into a fully integrated thermoplastic cartridge within a palm-sized mobile device, POC-CRISPR was able to detect 1 genome equivalent (GE)/{micro}L SARS-CoV-2 RNA from a sample volume of 100 {micro}L in 30 min. Moreover, when evaluated with unprocessed clinical nasopharyngeal (NP) swab eluates, POC-CRISPR identified SARS-CoV-2 positive samples in as short as 20 min and achieved full concordance with standard RT-qPCR.","Chen, F.-E.; Lee, P.-W.; Park, J.

16579,Correlation between Chest CT Severity Scores and the Clinical Parameters of Adult Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia,"PurposeOur aim is to correlate the clinical condition of patients with COVID-19 infection with the 25 Point CT severity score by Chang et al (devised for assessment of ARDS in patients with SARS in 2005).

Material and MethodsData of consecutive symptomatic patients who were suspected to have COVID-19 infection and presented to our hospital, was collected from March to April 2020. All patients underwent two consecutive RT-PCR tests and had a non-contrast HRCT scan done at presentation. From the original cohort of 1062 patients, 160 patients were excluded leaving a total number of 902 patients.

ResultsThe mean age was 44.2 {+/-}11.9 years [85.3%males, 14.7%females]. CT severity score found to be positively correlated with lymphopenia, increased serum CRP, d-dimer and ferritin levels (p < 0.0001). The oxygen requirements as well as length of hospital stay were increasing with the increase of scan severity.

ConclusionThe 25-point CT severity score correlates well with the COVID-19 clinical severity. Our data suggest that chest CT scoring system can aid in predicting COVID-19 disease outcome and significantly correlates with lab tests and oxygen requirements.","Saeed, G.; Gaba, W.; Shah, A.; Al Helali, A.; Raidullah, E.; Al Ali, A.; Elghazali, M.; Ahmed, D.; Al Kaabi, S.; Almazrouei, S.",2020-10-20,Radiology And Imaging,10.1101/2020.10.15.20213058,1,Ghufran Saeed,Sheikh Khalifa Medical City,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.20213058v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.20213058v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
9196,"Predictive usefulness of PCR testing in different patterns of Covid-19 symptomatology - Analysis of a French cohort of 12,810 outpatients","Polymerase Chain reaction (PCR) is a key tool to diagnose Covid-19. Yet access to PCR is often limited. In this paper, we develop a clinical strategy for prescribing PCR to patients based on data from COVIDOM, a French cohort of 54,000 patients with clinically suspected Covid-19 including 12,810 patients tested by PCR. Using a machine learning algorithm (a decision tree), we show that symptoms alone are sufficient to predict PCR outcome with a mean average precision of 86%. We identify combinations of symptoms that are predictive of PCR positivity (90% for anosmia/ageusia) or negativity (only 30% of PCR+ for a subgroup with cardiopulmonary symptoms): in both cases, PCR provides little added diagnostic value. We deduce a prescribing strategy based on clinical presentation that can improve the global efficiency of PCR testing.","Ap-Hp / Universities / Inserm Covid-19 Research Co Covid-19 Research Collaboration Members,  ; Apra, C.; Caucheteux, C.; Mensch, A.; Mansour, J.; Bernaux, M.; Dechartres, A.; Debuc, E.; Lescure, X.; Dinh, A.; Paris, N.; Gramfort, A.; Yordanov, Y.; Jourdain, P.",2020-06-09,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.07.20124438,1,Caroline Apra,Sorbonne University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.07.20124438v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.07.20124438v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
5027,From Community Acquired Pneumonia to COVID-19: A Deep Learning Based Method for Quantitative Analysis of COVID-19 on thick-section CT Scans,"BackgroundThick-section CT scanners are more affordable for the developing countries. Considering the widely spread COVID-19, it is of great benefit to develop an automated and accurate system for quantification of COVID-19 associated lung abnormalities using thick-section chest CT images.

PurposeTo develop a fully automated AI system to quantitatively assess the disease severity and disease progression using thick-section chest CT images.

Materials and MethodsIn this retrospective study, a deep learning based system was developed to automatically segment and quantify the COVID-19 infected lung regions on thick-section chest CT images. 531 thick-section CT scans from 204 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were collected from one appointed COVID-19 hospital from 23 January 2020 to 12 February 2020. The lung abnormalities were first segmented by a deep learning model. To assess the disease severity (non-severe or severe) and the progression, two imaging bio-markers were automatically computed, i.e., the portion of infection (POI) and the average infection HU (iHU). The performance of lung abnormality segmentation was examined using Dice coefficient, while the assessment of disease severity and the disease progression were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the Cohens kappa statistic, respectively.

ResultsDice coefficient between the segmentation of the AI system and the manual delineations of two experienced radiologists for the COVID-19 infected lung abnormalities were 0.74{+/-}0.28 and 0.76{+/-}0.29, respectively, which were close to the inter-observer agreement, i.e., 0.79{+/-}0.25. The computed two imaging bio-markers can distinguish between the severe and non-severe stages with an AUC of 0.9680 (p-value< 0.001). Very good agreement ({kappa} = 0.8220) between the AI system and the radiologists were achieved on evaluating the changes of infection volumes.

ConclusionsA deep learning based AI system built on the thick-section CT imaging can accurately quantify the COVID-19 associated lung abnormalities, assess the disease severity and its progressions.

Key ResultsA deep learning based AI system was able to accurately segment the infected lung regions by COVID-19 using the thick-section CT scans (Dice coefficient [&ge;] 0.74).

The computed imaging bio-markers were able to distinguish between the non-severe and severe COVID-19 stages (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.968).

The infection volume changes computed by the AI system was able to assess the COVID-19 progression (Cohens kappa 0.8220).

Summary StatementA deep learning based AI system built on the thick-section CT imaging can accurately quantify the COVID-19 infected lung regions, assess patients disease severity and their disease progressions.","Li, Z.; Zhong, Z.; Li, Y.; Zhang, T.; Gao, L.; Jin, D.; Sun, Y.; Ye, X.; Yu, L.; Hu, Z.; Xiao, J.; Huang, L.; Tang, Y.",2020-04-23,Radiology And Imaging,10.1101/2020.04.17.20070219,1,Yuling Tang,"Department of Respiratory Medicine, The First Hospital of Changsha City, Changsha, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20070219v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20070219v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1007/s00330-020-07042-x
14898,"The impact of natural disasters on the spread of COVID-19: a geospatial, agent based epidemiology model","Background: Natural disasters and infectious diseases are global issues, resulting in widespread disruption to human health and livelihood. At the scale of a global pandemic, the co-occurrence of natural disasters is inevitable. However, the impact of natural disasters on the spread of COVID-19 has not been extensively evaluated using agent based epidemiology models. Methods: We create an agent-based epidemiology model based on both COVID-19 clinical and epidemiological data and geographic data. We first model 35 scenarios with varying natural disaster timing and duration for a COVID-19 outbreak in a theoretical region. We then evaluate the potential effect of an eruption of Vesuvius volcano on the spread of COVID-19 in Campania, Italy. Our objective is to determine if the occurrence of a natural disaster during the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase infection cases and disease related fatalities. Results: In a majority of cases, the occurrence of a natural disaster increases the number of disease related fatalities. When the natural disaster occurs at the beginning of the outbreak within a given region, there is little to no increase in the progression of disease spread. However, the occurrence of a natural disaster close to the peak of infections may increase the number of fatalities by more than five-fold. In a theoretical test case, for a natural disaster that occurred fifty days after first infection case, the median increase in fatalities is 2%, 59%, and 180% for a 2, 14, and 31-day long natural disaster respectively, when compared to the no natural disaster scenario. Conclusion: We propose that the compound risk from natural disasters is greatest in the case of already widespread disease outbreak. The key risk factors for increase in spread of infection and disease related fatalities are the timing of the natural disaster relative to the peak in infections and the duration of the natural disaster.","Van Wyk De Vries, M.

14624,The role of NIH funding in vaccine readiness; foundational research and NIH funding underlying candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines,"This work characterizes the NIH contribution to vaccine technologies being employed in ""warp speed"" development of vaccines for COVID-19, as well as the lack of sustained NIH funding for published research against recognized epidemic threats. Using quantitative methods, we examined the advance of published research on ten of the vaccine technologies incorporated in the 165 candidate vaccines entering development through July 2020 as well as the NIH funding that supported this research. Live, attenuated virus, inactivated virus, and adjuvant technologies have been used in successful products since the 1950s and continue to exhibit steady advance. Synthetic (recombinant) vaccines, viral vectors, DNA, and TLR9 agonists as adjuvants emerged since the 1980s, and exhibit a logistic, ""S-curve"" pattern of growth characteristic of emerging technologies that have passed an analytically-defined established point. In contrast, mRNA, virus-like particle, and nanoparticle technologies show exponential growth characteristic of technologies short of their established points. The body of research and NIH funding for established and emerging vaccine technologies exhibited sustained growth through the late 2010s, supported by > 16,000 project years of NIH funding totaling over $17.2 billion (2000-2019), the majority through cooperative agreements and intramural programs. NIH funding for published research on vaccines for recognized zoonotic threats including coronavirus, Zika, Ebola, and dengue, however, has been inconsistent and reactive to disease outbreaks. These data are considered in the context of the high failure rate for candidate vaccines and evidence that technological maturity is a significant factor in the efficiency of product development. Sustained funding for both enabling technologies and vaccine development is essential to ensure a rapid response to COVID and future pandemic threats.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThis work examines the advance of research and NIH funding for technologies being employed in ""warp speed"" development of COVID-19 vaccines in the context of evidence that mature technologies have a greater likelihood of generating successful products. We show that candidate vaccines for COVID-19 employ a variety of established and still-emerging technologies, and identify $17.2 billion in NIH funding for this research from 2000-2019. In contrast, NIH funding for published research for vaccines on recognized pandemic threats has been inconsistent. This work highlights the significance and scale of the NIH contribution to vaccine technologies and the lack of sustained initiatives for vaccine development.","Kiszewski, A. E.; Galkina Cleary, E.

20092,Twitter Discourse on Nicotine as Potential Prophylactic or Therapeutic for COVID-19,"ObjectiveThe low observed prevalence of smokers among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in certain cohorts has led to a hypothesis regarding nicotines therapeutic role in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. As new scientific evidence surfaces, premature conclusions about nicotine are rife in social media, especially unwarranted leaps of such associations to vaping and smoking. This study reports on the prevalence of such leaps and the nature of authors who are making them.

MethodsWe used a Twitter API subscription service to download tweets (n = 17,533) that match terms indicating nicotine or vaping themes, in addition to those that point to a prophylactic or therapeutic effect and COVID-19 (January-July 2020). Using a windowing approach, we focused on tweets that are more likely to convey the therapeutic intent. We hand-annotated these filtered tweets and built a classifier that identifies tweets that extrapolate a nicotine link to vaping/smoking. We analyzed the frequently used terms in author bios, top Web links, and hashtags of such tweets.

Results21% of our filtered tweets indicate a vaping/smoking-based prevention/treatment narrative. Our classifier was able to spot tweets that make unproven claims about vaping/smoking and COVID-19 with a positive predictive value of 85%. Qualitative analyses show a variety of ways therapeutic claims are being made and user bios reveal pre-existing notions of positive stances toward vaping.

ConclusionThe social media landscape is a double-edged sword in tobacco communication. Although it increases information reach, consumers can also be subject to confirmation bias when exposed to inadvertent or deliberate framing of scientific discourse that may border on misinformation. This calls for circumspection and additional planning in countering such narratives as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage our world.","Kavuluru, R.; Noh, J.; Rose, S.

19847,Acceptable Performance of the Abbott ID NOW Among Symptomatic Individuals with Confirmed COVID-19,"INTRODUCTIONPoint of care diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, such as the ID NOW, have great potential to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The ID NOW is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic individuals within the first 7 days of symptom onset for COVID-19 if tested within 1 hour of specimen collection. However, clinical data on the performance of the ID NOW is limited, with many studies deviating from the manufacturers instructions and/or having small sample size.

METHODSAdults with COVID-19 in the community or hospital were recruited into the study. Paired throat swabs were collected, with one throat swab transported immediately in an empty sterile tube to the laboratory for ID NOW testing, and the other transported in universal transport media and tested by an in-house SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay targeting the E-gene. Positive percent agreement (PPA) was calculated.

RESULTS133 individuals were included in the study. 129 samples were positive on either the ID NOW and/or RT-PCR. Assuming any positive result on either assay represents a true positive, PPA of the ID NOW compared to RT-PCR with 95% confidence intervals was 89.1% [82.0% - 94.1%] and 91.6% [85.1% - 95.9%], respectively. When analyzing individuals with symptoms [&le;] 7 days and who had the ID NOW performed within an hour, ID NOW PPA increased to 98.2%.

1826,"Evaluating new evidence in the early dynamics of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China with real time domestic traffic and potential asymptomatic transmissions","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has spread to 28 countries/regions with over 43,000 confirmed cases. Much about this outbreak is still unknown. At this early stage of the epidemic, it is important to investigate alternative sources of information to understand its dynamics and spread. With updated real time domestic traffic, this study aims to integrate recent evidence of international evacuees extracted from Wuhan between Jan. 29 and Feb. 2, 2020 to infer the dynamics of the COVD-19 outbreak in Wuhan. In addition, a modified SEIR model was used to evaluate the empirical support for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. Based on the data examined, this study found little evidence for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. However, it is still too early to rule out its presence conclusively due to sample size and other limitations. The updated basic reproductive number was found to be 2.12 on average with a 95% credible interval of [2.04, 2.18].

18870,Tolerability and Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Inhaled Dry Powder Hydroxychloroquine in Healthy Volunteers,"RationaleInhaled antimicrobials enable high local concentrations where needed and, compared to orally administration, greatly reduce the potential for systemic side effects. In SARS-CoV-2 infections, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) administered as dry powder via inhalation could be safer than oral HCQ allowing for higher and therefore more effective pulmonary concentrations without dose limiting toxic effects.

ObjectivesTo assess the local tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetic parameters of HCQ inhalations in single ascending doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg using the Cyclops dry powder inhaler.

Methods12healthy volunteers were trained in inhaling HCQ correctly. Local tolerability and safety were assessed by pulmonary function tests, ECG and recording adverse events. To estimate systemic exposure, serum samples were collected before and 0.5, 2 and 3.5 h after inhalation.

Results and discussionDry powder HCQ inhalations were well tolerated by the participants, except for transient bitter taste in all participants and minor coughing irritation. There was no significant change in QTc-interval or drop in FEV1 post inhalation. The serum HCQ concentration remained below 10 {micro}g/L in all samples.

ConclusionInhaled dry powder HCQ is safe and well tolerated. Our data support further studies with inhaled HCQ dry powder to evaluate pulmonary pharmacokinetics and efficacy is warranted.","De Reus, Y.; Hagedoorn, P.; Sturkenboom, M.; Grasmeijer, F.; Bolhuis, M.; Sibum, I.; Kerstjens, H.; Frijlink, E.; Akkerman, O.",2020-12-04,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.12.03.20243162,1,Onno Akkerman,University Medical Center Groningen,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.03.20243162v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.03.20243162v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

20176,Findings from Cardiovascular Evaluation of NCAA Division I Collegiate Student-Athletes after Asymptomatic or Mildly Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"ObjectivesThe risk of myocardial damage after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been controversial. There is an urgent need for data to support the appropriate level of cardiovascular screening for safe return-to-play. The purpose of this study is to report the incidence of abnormal cardiovascular findings in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I student-athletes with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsThis is a case series of student-athletes at a single NCAA Division I institution who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody testing (IgG) from 4/15/2020 to 10/31/2020. From 452 athletes who were screened, 5,124 PCR and 452 antibody tests were completed. Student-athletes were followed through 12/31/2020 (median 104 days, range 64-182 days). Cardiac work-up included clinical evaluation, troponin level, electrocardiogram (ECG), and echocardiogram. Additional work-up was ordered as clinically indicated.

Results55 student-athletes tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 38 (69%) had symptoms of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), 14 (26%) had a positive IgG test, and 41 (74%) had a positive PCR test. Eight abnormal cardiovascular screening evaluations necessitated further testing including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI). Two athletes received new cardiac diagnoses, one probable early cardiomyopathy and one pericarditis, while the remaining six had normal cardiac MRIs.

ConclusionThese data support recent publications which recommend the de-escalation of cardiovascular testing for athletes who have recovered from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Continued follow-up of these athletes for sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 is critical.","Hwang, C. E.; Kussman, A.; Christle, J. W.; Froelicher, V.; Wheeler, M. T.; Moneghetti, K.

3536,"Frequency of testing for COVID 19 infection and the presence of higher number of available beds per country predict outcomes with the infection, not the GDP of the country - A descriptive statistical analysis","IntroductionThe novel coronavirus epidemic which originated in late 2019 from China has wreaked havoc on millions across the world with illness, death and socioeconomic recession. As of now no valid treatment or preventative strategy has evolved worldwide and governments across the world have been forced to take the draconian step of social isolation in communities by enforcing ""lockdowns"".

Aim of this StudyThis study aims to correlate the rates of infection with the novel coronavirus and total deaths as the primary output variable. In addition the strength of association between infection rates and total death in comparison to GDP share of the respective countries, physicians, hospital beds and rates of testing for COVID 19 infection per thousand patients, is being assessed, in a bid to develop a model which would help to develop tools to reduce the impact of this disease.

Material & MethodsData relating to number of cases, severity, cases recovered and deaths worldwide and specifically for the top six countries affected was collected from the WHO COVID-19 situation report which is being updated on a daily basis till 22nd March 2020, the date of analysis. Additional data related to GDP, physician and hospital bed per 1000 patients were procured from the World Bank database. All data were collected in a file in CSV format. Analysis was conducted in Jupyter notebook with Python 3.8.2 software and also with XL-Stat statistical software for excel. The analytical strategy was descriptive with no inferential overtones.

ResultsCOVID 19 infection strongly correlates with total deaths (r : 0.89), with a predicted death rate of 25 patients per 1000 affected. There was no correlation between the GDP growth of the country and number of treating physicians/1000 patient population with any COVID 19 related outcome. However there was a negative correlation between COVID 19-related deaths and the number of beds available per 1000 population [r=-0.34]. Importantly there is an inverse correlation between the number of tests conducted per million population with the rates of active infections [r=-0.12], new cases [r=-0.38] and new deaths [r=-0.28] in COVID 19.

ConclusionThis is the first study to assess parameters other than age and sex and sets out a robust dataset which indicates an increased risk of worsening outcomes with lesser number of beds and testing, suggesting that the need of the hour is to increase available bed numbers and to increase rates of testing.","Ghosal, S.; Sinha, B.; Sengupta, S.; Majumder, M.",2020-04-06,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.04.01.20047373,1,Samit Ghosal,Nightingale Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20047373v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20047373v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
14055,The Potential Role of Extracellular Vesicles in COVID-19 Associated Endothelial injury and Pro-inflammation,"COVID-19 infection caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a global pandemic with the number of deaths growing exponentially. Early evidence points to significant endothelial dysfunction, micro-thromboses, pro-inflammation as well as a dysregulated immune response in the pathogenesis of this disease. In this study, we analyzed the cargo of EVs isolated from the plasma of patients with COVID-19 for the identifiction of potential biomarkers of disease severity and to explore their role in disease pathogenesis. Plasma-derived EVs were isolated from 53 hospitalized patients with COVID infection and compared according to the severity of the disease. Analysis of inflammatory and cardiovascular protein cargo of large EVs revealed significantly differentially expressed proteins for each disease sub-group. Notably, members of the TNF superfamily and IL-6 family were up-regulated in patients on oxygen support with severe and moderate disease. EVs from the severe group were also enhanced with pro-thrombotic/endothelial injury factors (TF, t-PA, vWF) and proteins associated with cardiovascular pathology (MB, PRSS8, REN, HGF). Significantly higher levels of TF, CD163, and EN-RAGE were observed in EVs from severe patients when compared to patients with a moderate disease requiring supplemental O2. Importantly, we also observed increased caspase 3/7 activity and decreased cell survival in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells exposed to EVs from the plasma of patients with severe disease compared to asymptomatic group. In conclusion, our findings indicate alterations in pro-inflammatory, coagulopathy, and endothelial injury protein cargo in large EVs in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection that may be a causative agent in severe illness.","Krishnamachary, B.; Cook, C.; Spikes, L.; Chalise, P.; Dhillon, N.

7101,COVID-19 infection results in alterations of the kynurenine pathway and fatty acid metabolism that correlate with IL-6 levels and renal status,"Previous studies suggest a role for systemic reprogramming of host metabolism during viral pathogenesis to fuel rapidly expanding viral proliferation, for example by providing free amino acids and fatty acids as building blocks. In addition, general alterations in metabolism can provide key understanding of pathogenesis. However, little is known about the specific metabolic effects of SARS-COV-2 infection. The present study evaluated the serum metabolism of COVID-19 patients (n=33), identified by a positive nucleic acid test of a nasopharyngeal swab, as compared to COVID-19-negative control patients (n=16). Targeted and untargeted metabolomics analyses specifically identified alterations in the metabolism of tryptophan into the kynurenine pathway, which is well-known to be involved in regulating inflammation and immunity. Indeed, the observed changes in tryptophan metabolism correlated with serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Metabolomics analysis also confirmed widespread dysregulation of nitrogen metabolism in infected patients, with decreased circulating levels of most amino acids, except for tryptophan metabolites in the kynurenine pathway, and increased markers of oxidant stress (e.g., methionine sulfoxide, cystine), proteolysis, and kidney dysfunction (e.g., creatine, creatinine, polyamines). Increased circulating levels of glucose and free fatty acids were also observed, consistent with altered carbon homeostasis in COVID-19 patients. Metabolite levels in these pathways correlated with clinical laboratory markers of inflammation and disease severity (i.e., IL-6 and C-reactive protein) and renal function (i.e., blood urea nitrogen). In conclusion, this initial observational study of the metabolic consequences of COVID-19 infection in a clinical cohort identified amino acid metabolism (especially kynurenine and cysteine/taurine) and fatty acid metabolism as correlates of COVID-19, providing mechanistic insights, potential markers of clinical severity, and potential therapeutic targets.

20006,Humoral and cell-mediated response in colostrum after exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,"BackgroundColostrum provides an immune sharing between a mother and her infant. The transfer in colostrum of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the elicited cytokines may provide crucial protection to the infant. There is limited literature on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 present in colostrum.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the presence of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 and the associated cytokines in colostrum from women who tested positive for the virus.

Study DesignBetween March and September 2020 we obtained bilateral colostrum samples collected on spot cards within 48 hours of delivery from 15 new mothers who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Five of these 15 COVID-19 positive women also provided bilateral liquid colostrum within 1-2 days of providing the spot card samples. Archived bilateral colostrum samples collected from 8 women during 2011-2013 were used as pre-COVID-19 controls. All samples were tested for reactivity to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using an ELISA that measures SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgA, IgG, and IgM, and for concentrations of 10 inflammatory cytokines (IFN{gamma}, TNF, IL-1{beta}, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13) using a multiplex electrochemiluminescent sandwich assay.

ResultsBilateral colostrum samples from 73%, 73% and 33% of the 15 COVID-19 mothers exhibited IgA, IgG, and IgM reactivity to RBD respectively. Colostrum samples from two of the 8 pre-pandemic controls showed IgA and IgG reactivity to RBD. Additionally, COVID-19 mothers had significantly higher levels of 9 of the 10 inflammatory markers (all except IFN{gamma}) as compared to the pre-COVID-19 controls. Comparable results were obtained with both the spot card-eluates and liquid samples.

ConclusionsA strong humoral immune response is present in the colostrum of women who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 before delivering. High levels of 9 inflammatory markers were also present in the colostrum. The evolution and duration of the antibody response, as well as dynamics of the cytokine response, remain to be determined. Our results also indicate that future large-scale studies can be conducted with milk easily collected on paper spot cards.","Narayanaswamy, V.; Pentecost, B.; Alfandari, D.; Chin, E.; Minor, K.; Kastrinakis, A.; Lieberman, T.; Arcaro, K.

13650,A delayed SEIQR epidemic model of COVID-19 in Tokyo area,"The rapid expansion of COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic. In order to avoid excessive restriction to the social activity, a good strategy of quarantine is needed. Several epidemic models with a quarantine compartment such as susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-removed (SEIQR) model have been applied. However, in the actual situation, the infection test and quarantine is often delayed from the beginning of the infectious stage. This article presents a delayed SEIQR model to analyze the effect of the delay of quarantine, and to suggest a guideline for the measure. The latency period (compartment E) was assumed to be 3 days, and the start of quarantine action was assumed to be delayed by 4 to 10 days from infection. The actual PCR test-positive number data from March 10th to July 18th in 2020 was analyzed to estimate a transmission rate and the reproduction number. The area where the infection expansion is restrained was displayed in the two parameter space (transmission rate and quarantine rate) for several possible lengths of the delay of quarantine. As a result, it was shown to be very hard to restrain the expansion of infection only by a simple quarantine action retaining the delay. As a short term measure, it was found to be necessary to reduce the transmission rate through some kind of restriction of social activity, but as a long term measure, it was found to be possible to maintain the social activity by shortening the delay of quarantine through expanding the infection test system to find earlier stage patients, including asymptomatic infectious patients. In order to shed light to this conclusion from a different viewpoint, this model was applied in another case that an additional quarantine was taken into account before the delay. The result was shown to have a similar effect as that of the shortening of the delay.","Maki, K.",2020-11-07,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.08.18.20177709,6,Kazuo Maki,MediEco R&D Corporation,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20177709v6?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20177709v6.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
7117,"Country differences in hospitalisation, length of stay, admission to Intensive Care Units, and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection at the end of the first wave in Europe: a rapid review of available literature","ObjectivesCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is spreading rapidly worldwide and threatening the collapse of national health care systems. The development of effective resource models are critical for long term health planning. The aim was to evaluate the available literature, to consider parameters affecting hospital resources, to effectively guide health policy and planning for future waves of infection.

DesignA detailed search of the literature, using Google Scholar, PubMED, MedRxiv and BioRxiv, was conducted for the time period 1st Dec 2019 to 31st May 2020; using appropriate keywords: resultant articles were scrutinised in detail, and appraised for reported data pertaining to hospitalization and hospital length of stay (LOS).

ResultsDisease presentation was described in China; 81 % mild, 14 % moderate and 5 % severe. The experience, thus far, in Europe and the USA are suggestive of a higher degree of severity. Initial reports suggest high hospitalisation and ICU admittance rates. More recent reports from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) lower this estimation. Perhaps the relative age, the level of pre-existing conditions, and other health factors may be contributors to differences. Data from Irish cases suggest hospitalisation rate may be lower in parts of Europe and time dependent. Hospital LOS is described in 55 articles, with median lengths of stay between 3 and 52 days. The evidence regarding the LOS in ICU is reported in 31 studies, 26 deemed relevant. The majority of studies report ICU LOS between 7 to 11 days. Many of these studies are likely skewed towards shorter stay due to study cut-off dates. Indications based on ICU LOS reported for patients continuing care suggest median ICU stay will progressively increase.

ConclusionsThese parameter estimates are key to the development of an effective health care resource model. Based on our appraisal of the literature, is it essential that Europe manages mitigation measures to ensure that hospital and ICU capacity does not become overwhelmed to manage COVID-19 in subsequent infection waves.

15494,Identifying gaps in COVID-19 health equity data reporting in Canada using a scorecard approach,"ObjectiveTo assess thealth equity-oriented COVID-19 data reporting across Canadian provinces and territories, using a scorecard approach.

MethodA scan was performed of provincial and territorial reporting of five data elements (cumulative totals of tests, cases, hospitalizations, deaths and population size) across three units of aggregation (province or territory-level, health regions, and local areas) (15 ""overall"" indicators), and for two vulnerable settings (long term care and detention facilities) and six social markers (age, sex, immigration status, race/ethnicity, essential worker status, and income) (120 ""equity-related"" indicators). Per indicator, one point was awarded if case-delimited data were released, 0.7 points if only summary statistics were reported, and 0 if neither was provided. Results were presented using a scorecard approach.

ResultsOverall, information on cases and deaths was more complete than for tests, hospitalizations and population size denominators needed for rate estimation. Information provided on jurisdictions and their regions, overall, tended to be more available (average score of 53%, ""B"") than for equity-related indicators (average score of 21%, ""D""). Only British Columbia and Alberta provided case-delimited data, and only Alberta provided information for local areas. No jurisdiction reported on outcomes according to patients individual-level immigration status, race, or income. Only Ontario and Quebec provided detailed information for long-term care settings and detention facilities.

ConclusionSocially stratified reporting for COVID-19 outcomes is sparse in Canada. However, several ""best practices"" in health equity-oriented reporting were observed and set a relevant precedent for all jurisdictions to follow for this pandemic and future ones.","Blair, A.; Warsame, K.; Naik, H.; Byrne, W.; Parnia, A.; Siddiqi, A.",2020-09-25,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.23.20200147,1,Alexandra Blair,University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.23.20200147v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.23.20200147v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

A stark increase in seropositivity in the sentinel group started the week ending March 22 and in the screening group in the week ending March 29. By the week ending April 19, the seroprevalence in the screening group reached 19.3%, which is well below the estimated 67% needed to achieve community immunity to SARS-CoV-2.

9182,Dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the earliest-affected areas in Italy: 1 Mass screening for SARS-CoV-2 serological positivity (SARS-2-SCREEN).,"BackgroundSeveral municipalities in the Lombardy Region have been affected by the SARS-CoV-2 infection since the earliest stages of the epidemic. To date, 89442 confirmed cases have been diagnosed in Lombardy, and mortality in several municipalities has already surpassed that of the past decade. Currently, the true extent of the SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown as several affected subjects may have been asymptomatic or have presented mild disease, thus not resulting in the identified COVID-19 cases.

MethodsThis cross-sectional study aims to define the spread of infection within the population by determining the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 by rapid immunochromatographic testing and subsequent confirmation by serology on venous blood by liquid phase immunochemical testing, also allowing to compare the two methods. Testing will be performed on adults and minors residing, domiciled or working in several municipalities of the Lombardy Region, involved in the initial stages of the epidemic. The study will include rapid finger-prick testing and venous sampling for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and nasopharyngeal swabbing (NPS). Concurrent notification of test results will occur via the regional healthcare information system (SISS).

DiscussionThis study was developed with the desire to understand the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the epidemiological transmission characteristics of this virus. Understanding the spread and severity of the disease could help in the implementation of effective infection surveillance containment and countermeasures facilitating the identification of cases that have been exposed to the virus and the traceability of contacts.

This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Milan (35/2020).","Pagani, G.; Bernacchia, D.; Conti, F.; Giacomelli, A.; Rondanin, R.; Scolari, V.; Boracchi, P.; Gandolfi, C.

20530,Population-scale patient safety data reveal inequalities in adverse events before and during COVID-19 pandemic,"Adverse patient safety events were associated with 110 thousand deaths in the U.S. alone in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has further challenged the ability of healthcare systems to ensure medication safety, and its effects on patient safety remain unknown. Here, we investigate negative outcomes associated with medication use before and during the pandemic. Using a dataset of 10,443,476 reports involving 3,624 drugs and 19,193 adverse events, we develop an algorithmic approach to analyze the pandemics impact on incidence of drug safety events by evaluating disproportional reporting relative to the pre-pandemic time, quantifying unexpected trends in clinical outcomes, and adjusting for drug interference. Among 64 adverse events identified by our analyses, we find 54 have increased incidence rates during the pandemic, even though reporting of adverse events has decreased by 4.4% overall. We find clinically relevant differences in drug safety outcomes between demographic groups. Comparing to male patients, women report 47.0% more distinct adverse events whose occurrence significantly increased during the pandemic relative to pre-pandemic levels. Out of 53 adverse events with the pre-pandemic gender gap, 33 have increased gap during the pandemic more than would have been expected had the pandemic not occurred. While musculoskeletal and metabolic side effects are disproportionately enriched in women during the pandemic, immune-related adverse events are enriched only in men. We also find the number of adverse events with a higher reporting ratio during the pandemic in adults is higher (16.8%) than in older patients (adjusted for population size). Our findings have implications for safe medication use and public health policy and highlight the role of variation in adverse events for improving patient safety during a public health emergency.","Zhang, X.; Sumathipala, M.; Zitnik, M.",2021-01-20,Pharmacology And Therapeutics,10.1101/2021.01.17.21249988,1,Marinka Zitnik,Harvard Unviersity; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; Harvard Data Science Initiative,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.17.21249988v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.17.21249988v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
3113,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"The current outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an unprecedented global health and economic threat to interconnected human societies. Until a vaccine is developed, strategies for controlling the outbreak rely on aggressive social distancing. These measures largely disconnect the social network fabric of human societies, especially in urban areas. Here, we estimate the growth rates and reproductive numbers of COVID-19 in US cities from March 14th through March 19th to reveal a power-law scaling relationship to city population size. This means that COVID-19 is spreading faster on average in larger cities with the additional implication that, in an uncontrolled outbreak, larger fractions of the population are expected to become infected in more populous urban areas. We discuss the implications of these observations for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, emphasizing the need to implement more aggressive distancing policies in larger cities while also preserving socioeconomic activity.","Stier, A.

8439,Measuring COVID-19 and Influenza in the Real World via Person-Generated Health Data,"BackgroundSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, data from smartphones and connected sensors have been used to better understand presentation and management outside the clinic walls. However, reports on the validity of such data are still sparse, especially when it comes to symptom progression and relevance of wearable sensors.

ObjectiveTo understand the relevance of Person-Generated Health Data (PGHD) as a means for early detection, monitoring, and management of COVID-19 in everyday life. This type of data include quantifying prevalence and progression of symptoms from self-reports as well as changes in activity and physiological parameters continuously measured from wearable sensors, and contextualizing findings for COVID-19 patients with those from cohorts of flu patients.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsRetrospective digital cohort study of individuals with a self-reported positive SARS-CoV-2 or influenza test followed over the period 2019-12-02 to 2020-04-27. Three cohorts were derived: Patients who self-reported being diagnosed with flu prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (N=6270, of which 1226 also contributed sensor PGHD); Patients who reported being diagnosed with flu during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (N=426, of which 85 also shared sensor PGHD); and patients who reported being diagnosed with COVID-19 (N=230, of which sensor PGHD was available for 41). The cohorts were derived from a large-scale digital participatory surveillance study designed to track Influenza-like Illness (ILI) incidence and burden over time.

ExposuresSelf-reported demographic data, comorbidities, and symptoms experienced during a diagnosed ILI episode, including SARS-CoV-2. Physiological and behavioral parameters measured daily from commercial wearable sensors, including Resting Heart Rate (RHR), total step count, and nightly sleep hours.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresWe investigated the percentage of individuals experiencing symptoms of a given type (e.g. shortness of breath) across demographic groups and over time. We examined illness duration, and care seeking behavior, and how RHR, step count, and nightly sleep hours deviated from expected behavior on healthy days over the course of the infection episode.

ResultsSelf-reported symptoms of COVID-19 present differently from flu. COVID-19 cases tended to last longer than flu (median of 12 vs. 9 days), are uniquely characterized by chest pain/pressure, shortness of breath, and anosmia. The fraction of elevated RHR measurements collected daily from commercial wearable devices rise significantly in the 2 days surrounding ILI symptoms onset, but does not appear to do so in a way specific to COVID-19. Steps lost due to COVID-19 persists for longer than for flu.

Conclusion and RelevancePGHD can be a valid source of longitudinal real world data to detect and monitor COVID-19-related symptoms and behaviors at population scale. PGHD may provide continuous, near real-time feedback to intervention effectiveness that otherwise requires waiting for symptoms to develop into contacts with the healthcare system. It has also the potential to increase pre-test probability of other downstream diagnostics. To effectively leverage PGHD for participatory surveillance it is crucial to invest in the creation of trusted, long-term communication channels with individuals through which data can be efficiently collected, consented, and contextualized, while protecting the privacy of individuals and ultimately facilitating the transition in and out of care.","Marinsek, N.; Shapiro, A.; Clay, I.; Bradshaw, B.; Ramirez, E.; Min, J.; Trister, A.; Wang, Y.; Althoff, T.; Foschini, L.",2020-05-30,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.28.20115964,1,Luca Foschini,Evidation Health,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.20115964v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.20115964v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.patter.2020.100188
10650,Findings and prognostic value of lung ultrasound in COVID-19 pneumonia,"ObjectivesThe aim is to systematically describe the findings of lung ultrasound in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and to analyze its prognostic value.

MethodsLung ultrasound was performed to 63 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to a University Hospital. Lung involvement was evaluated using a 4-point scale with a 12-area pulmonary division (lung score -LS-). Ultrasound findings, along with clinical characteristics, were recorded.

ResultsAll patients showed ultrasound involvement in at least 1 area (mean 8 {+/-} 3.5). Total LS was 15.3 {+/-} 8.1, without differences between left and right lung. Most affected regions were the lower one (95.2%) and the posterior one (73.8%). Total LS showed a strong correlation (r = -0.765) with PaO2/FiO2; by lung regions, those with a higher correlation were the LS of the anterior one (r = -0.823) and the LS of the upper one (r = -0.731). 22.2% of patients required non-invasive respiratory support (NIRS). Multivariate analysis shows that anterior region LS, adjusted for age and sex, is significant (odds ratio 2.159, 95% confidence interval 1.309 to 3.561) for the risk of requiring NIRS. Anterior region LS [&ge;] 4 and total LS [&ge;]19 have similar characteristics to predict the need for NIRS.

ConclusionsUltrasound involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia is bilateral and heterogeneous. Most affected regions are the posterior and the lower ones. The anterior region has prognostic value, because its involvement strongly correlates with the risk of requiring NIRS, and an anterior region LS [&ge;] 4 has high sensitivity and specificity for predicting the need for NIRS.","Castelao, J.; Graziani, D.; Collaborative Working Group Covid Pulmonology Guadalajara,  ; Soriano, J.

15386,Molecular Architecture of Early Dissemination and Massive Second Wave of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus in a Major Metropolitan Area,"We sequenced the genomes of 5,085 SARS-CoV-2 strains causing two COVID-19 disease waves in metropolitan Houston, Texas, an ethnically diverse region with seven million residents. The genomes were from viruses recovered in the earliest recognized phase of the pandemic in Houston, and an ongoing massive second wave of infections. The virus was originally introduced into Houston many times independently. Virtually all strains in the second wave have a Gly614 amino acid replacement in the spike protein, a polymorphism that has been linked to increased transmission and infectivity. Patients infected with the Gly614 variant strains had significantly higher virus loads in the nasopharynx on initial diagnosis. We found little evidence of a significant relationship between virus genotypes and altered virulence, stressing the linkage between disease severity, underlying medical conditions, and host genetics. Some regions of the spike protein - the primary target of global vaccine efforts - are replete with amino acid replacements, perhaps indicating the action of selection. We exploited the genomic data to generate defined single amino acid replacements in the receptor binding domain of spike protein that, importantly, produced decreased recognition by the neutralizing monoclonal antibody CR30022. Our study is the first analysis of the molecular architecture of SARS-CoV-2 in two infection waves in a major metropolitan region. The findings will help us to understand the origin, composition, and trajectory of future infection waves, and the potential effect of the host immune response and therapeutic maneuvers on SARS-CoV-2 evolution.","Long, S.

4257,Comparison of different exit scenarios from the lock-down for COVID-19 epidemic in the UK and assessing uncertainty of the predictions,"We model further development of the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK given the current data and assuming different scenarios of handling the epidemic. In this research, we further extend the stochastic model suggested in [1] and incorporate in it all available to us knowledge about parameters characterising the behaviour of the virus and the illness induced by it. The models we use are flexible, comprehensive, fast to run and allow us to incorporate the following: O_LItime-dependent strategies of handling the epidemic;
C_LIO_LIspatial heterogeneity of the population and heterogeneity of development of epidemic in different areas;
C_LIO_LIspecial characteristics of particular groups of people, especially people with specific medical pre-histories and elderly.
C_LI

Standard epidemiological models such as SIR and many of its modifications are not flexible enough and hence are not precise enough in the studies that requires the use of the features above. Decision-makers get serious benefits from using better and more flexible models as they can avoid of nuanced lock-downs, better plan the exit strategy based on local population data, different stages of the epidemic in different areas, making specific recommendations to specific groups of people; all this resulting in a lesser impact on economy, improved forecasts of regional demand upon NHS allowing for intelligent resource allocation.

In this work, we investigate the sensitivity of the model to all its parameters while considering several realistic scenarios of what is likely to happen with the dynamics of the epidemic after the lock-down, which has started on March 23, is lifted.

The main findings from this research are the following O_LIvery little gain, in terms of the projected hospital bed occupancy and expected numbers of death, of continuing the lock-down beyond April 13, provided the isolation of older and vulnerable people continues and the public carries on some level of isolation in the next 2-3 months, see Section 3.1;
C_LIO_LIin agreement with [1], isolation of the group of vulnerable people during the next 2-3 months should be one of the main priorities, see Section 3.2;
C_LIO_LIit is of high importance that the whole population carries on some level of isolation in the next 2-3 months, see Section 3.5;
C_LIO_LIthe timing of the current lock-down seems to be very sensible in areas like London where the epidemic has started to pick up by March 23; in such areas the second wave of epidemic is not expected, see figures in Sections 2.2 and 3;
C_LIO_LIthe epidemic should almost completely finish in July, no global second wave should be expected, except areas where the first wave is almost absent, see Section 3.4.

4643,Objective olfactory testing in patients presenting with sudden onset olfactory dysfunction as the first manifestation of confirmed COVID-19 infection,"BackgroundThe aims of this study are to investigate the COVID-19 status of patients with initial sudden olfactory anosmia (ISOA) using nasopharyngeal swabs for RT-PCR analysis and to explore their olfactory dysfunctions with psychophysical olfactory evaluation.

MethodologyThis prospective study included 78 ISOA patients who fulfilled a patient-reported outcome questionnaire and underwent a nasopharyngeal swabs. Among these, 46 patients performed psychophysical olfactory evaluation using sniffing tests. Based on the duration of the ISOA, two groups of patients were compared: patients with anosmia duration [&le;]12 days (group 1) and those with duration >12 days (group 2).

ResultsAmong group 1, 42 patients (87.5%) had a positive viral load regarding RT-PCR while 6 patients (12.5%) were negative. In group 2, 7 patients (23%) had a positive viral load and 23 patients (77%) were negative. Among the 46 patients having performed a psychophysical olfactory evaluation, we observed anosmia in 52% (N=24), hyposmia in 24% (N=11) and normosmia in 24% (N=11) of patients. The viral load significantly decreased throughout the 14-days following the onset of the olfactory disorder.

ConclusionsOur results support that a high proportion of ISOA patients are Covid+.

In this study, we developed an assay using surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) coupled with multivariate analysis to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 in an ultra-fast manner without any pretreatment (e.g., RNA extraction). Using silver-nanorod SERS array functionalized with cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), we obtained strong SERS signals of ACE2 at 1032, 1051, 1089, 1189, 1447 and 1527 cm-1. The recognition and binding of receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on SERS assay significantly quenched the spectral intensities of most peaks and exhibited a shift from 1189 to 1182 cm-1. On-site tests on 17 water samples with a portable Raman spectrometer proved its accuracy and easy-operation for spot diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to evaluate disinfection performance, explore viral survival in environmental media, assess viral decay in wastewater treatment plant and track SARS-CoV-2 in pipe network.

17065,The Incidence and Severity of COVID-19 in Adult Professional Soccer Players,"IntroductionAt present, there are no data regarding the incidence and clinical course of COVID-19 among professional soccer players, and the studies examining putative complications of COVID-19 infections are probabilistic. Thus, examining the incidence of COVID-19 and various aspects of its clinical course in a group of adult professional soccer players would be of great practical interest.

MethodsThe incidence, clinical course, and severity of COVID-19 infection, as well as the duration of treatment and return to play were studied by the questioning of the team physicians and medical records assessment in the group of adult professional soccer players representing the clubs of the Russian Premier-League (RPL) during the period of championship resumption from 01.04.2020 until 20.09.2020.

ResultsCOVID-19 infection was detected in 103 soccer players in the course of COVID-19 screening. This number comprises 14.5% of all soccer players which were on the rosters of RPL soccer teams and which were subject to regular COVID-19 testing.

The asymptomatic course was observed in 43.7% of cases (n=45). These players were isolated and their clinical condition was monitored closely. Clinical symptoms were observed in 56.3% of cases (n=58), the most common symptoms being fatigue, headache, fever, and anosmia.

ConclusionsCOVID-19 infection was commonly diagnosed among adult professional soccer players continuously residing in Russia. However, the majority of infections had a mild course and did not impair return to regular exercise.","Bezuglov, E.; Lazarev, A.; Achkasov, E.; Khaitin, V.; Romanova, L.; Butovskiy, M.; Khokhlov, V.; Tsyplenko, M.; Linsky, A.; Chetverikov, P.; Sugaipov, M.; Petrov, A.; Talibov, O.",2020-10-27,Sports Medicine,10.1101/2020.10.27.20220400,1,Artemii Lazarev,"Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University (Sechenov University); High Performance Sport Laboratory, Moscow Witte University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.27.20220400v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.27.20220400v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
16770,"Associations between Affect, Physical Activity, and Anxiety Among US Children During COVID-19","We investigated how emotional responses (positive and negative affect), physical activity (PA), and sedentary behaviors related to anxiety among US children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sixty-four typically-developing children (63% girls) age 9-15 years old completed two virtual visits during height of ""stay-at-home"" measures between April 22 - July 29, 2020. Children completed 24-hour PA recalls, state portion of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC), and the shortened 10-item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children (PANAS-C). Children reported state anxiety scores that were more than 5 standard deviations greater than values from healthy pediatric populations prior to the pandemic. Children with higher positive affect and who reported more time in PA reported less state anxiety. Sedentary and leisure screen time were positively correlated with negative affect. Our findings suggest that maintaining positive affect, engaging in PA, and limiting leisure screen time may be important for child mental health during stressful periods.

Statement of RelevanceThere is increasing concern regarding how the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the psychological and physical health of children. To date, studies on mental health during the pandemic in children are limited. We investigated links between activity levels and psychological outcomes in children during the height of the ""stay-at-home"" measures. We found that children had anxiety scores that were more than 5 standard deviations greater than normative values from healthy pediatric populations prior to the pandemic, and 94% of children exceeded the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations on leisure screen time. Positive affect and physical activity were associated with reduced anxiety levels in children during the pandemic. These findings highlight the important mental health benefits of maintaining positive affect, engaging in physical activity, and limiting leisure screen time for children, especially during stressful periods.","Alves, J.

18240,Modeling the spread of Covid-19 under active management,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe challenges with modeling the spread of Covid-19 are its power-type growth during the middle stages with the exponents depending on time, and the saturation (currently) due to the protective measures. The two-phase solution we propose for the total number of detected cases of Covid-19 describes the actual curves in many countries almost with the accuracy of physics laws. Bessel functions play the key role in our approach. The differential equations we obtain are of universal type; they can describe general momentum and transient responses in behavioral psychology, invasion ecology, etc. Due to a very small number of parameters, namely, the initial transmission rate and the intensity of the hard and soft measures, we obtain a convincing explanation of the surprising uniformity of the curves of the spread in many different areas. This theory can serve as a tool for forecasting the epidemic spread and evaluating the efficiency of the protective measures, which is very much needed for epidemics. As its practical application, the computer programs aimed at providing projections for late stages of Covid-19 proved to be remarkably stable in many countries, including Western Europe, the USA and some in Asia. We provide a projection for the saturation of the 3rd wave in the USA: the corresponding number of total, detected or not, cases can presumably reach then the herd immunity levels (G-strains). This can be used to analyze the efficiency of the vaccinations.","Cherednik, I.",2020-12-15,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.11.20.20235903,3,Ivan Cherednik,UNC at Chapel Hill,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.20.20235903v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.20.20235903v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
5521,Global health security capacity against COVID-19 outbreak and its association with the case fatality rate: an analysis of annual data from 210 countries and territories,"BackgroundBecause infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, do not have specific boundaries, all countries must prioritize and use the necessary capabilities to prevent, detect, and respond quickly to public health emergencies. In this context, we aimed to review most recent GHS index annual report to observe the regional and global level of health security against COVID-19 outbreak, as well as their relationship with case fatality rate, among 210 countries and territories worldwide.

MethodsWe reviewed and analyzed October 2019 GHS index co-leaders joint report, to review health security capacities on the basis of the GHS index in the context of six categories. we prioritized not only the capacities of 210 countries and territories around the world using the GHS Index, but also the existence of functional, tested, proven capabilities for stopping outbreaks at the source. Data were collected from global databases including Worldometer, WHO, and Disease Control and Prevention Center (CDC).

FindingsThis study recruited data on 210 countries and territories, of which up to 14 April 2020, 72 countries (34.28%) with more than 1000 total COVID-19 cases were presents. In ""most prepared group"", number of total COVID-19 diagnostic tests had a significant positive relation with GHS index (r=0.713; p=0.006). Case fatality rate was directly associated with the detection index (r=0.304; p=0.023) in ""more prepared group"". In ""Lower-middle-income economies"" group, case fatality rate positively related to detection, response and risk environment indices.

ImplementationWith the exception of a very small number, countries that were ranked as most prepared countries, they were more likely to be affected by the COVID-19 outbreak of the virus and its health consequences, and needed to seriously reconsider their capabilities and health security in the context of detection, prevention, rapid response, health system facilities, and risk environment against disease outbreak

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSGiven the very rapid spread of the COVID-19 disease in a very short time, limited and few studies have shown weakness and strength in national and international capacity to deal with health emergencies. We systematically searched the Scopus, ISI web of science and PubMed from Jan 2019 to April 2020, using the search terms ""health security"" OR ""emergency preparedness"" AND ""COVID-19"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2/nCoV-2019"". Our search returned only limited number of published evidences (n=37), of which only one was assessed the operational readiness among 182 countries based on the International Health Regulations (IHR) annual report 1.

Added value of this studyGiven a very limited and insufficient on the regional, as well as global preparedness capacities to combat health emergencies, such as COVID-19 disease, we used most recent GHS index annual report (October 2019), to observe the regional and global level of health security in the context of detection, prevention, rapid response, health system facilities, and risk environment against COVID-19 outbreak among 210 countries and territories around the world. We found information about only 195 countries in the recent used report and imputed the data for the rest 15 countries and territories that facing COVID-19 outbreak.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur results showed that, with the exception of a very small number of countries that were ranked as most prepared countries, they were more likely to be affected by the COVID-19 outbreak of the virus and its health consequences, and needed to seriously reconsider their capabilities and health security in the context of detection, prevention, rapid response, health system facilities, and risk environment against disease outbreak.","Maraghi, E.; Saki Malehi, A.; Rahim, F.",2020-04-29,Emergency Medicine,10.1101/2020.04.25.20079186,1,Fakher Rahim,Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079186v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079186v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
15545,"Influence of COVID-19 confinement measures on appendectomies in Germany - administrative claims data analysis of 9,797 patients","Purpose: COVID 19 pandemic had multiple influences on the social, industrial and medical situation in all affected countries. Measures of obligatory medical confinement were suspensions of scheduled non-emergent surgical procedures and outpatients clinics as well as overall access restrictions to hospitals and medical practices. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess if the obligatory confinement (lockdown) had an effect on the number of appendectomies (during and after the period of lockdown). Methods: This retrospective study was based on anonymized nationwide administrative claims data of the German Local General Sickness Fund (AOK). Patients admitted for disease of the appendix (ICD-10: K35-K38) or abdominal and pelvic pain (ICD-10: R10) who undergone an appendectomy (OPS: 5-470) were included. The study period included six weeks of German lockdown (16.03.-26.04.2020) as well as six weeks before (03.02.-15.03.2020) and after (27.04.-07.06.2020). These periods were compared to the respective in 2019. Results: Overall number of appendectomies was significantly reduced during the lockdown time in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease affects only appendectomies due to acute simple and non-acute appendicitis. Numbers for appendectomies in acute complex appendicitis remained unchanged. Female patients and in the age group 1-18 years showed the strongest decrease in number of cases. Conclusion: The lockdown in Germany resulted in a decreased number of appendectomies. This affected mainly appendectomies in simple acute and non-acute appendicitis, but not complicated acute appendicitis. The study gives no evidence, that the confinement measures resulted in a deterioration of medical care for appendicitis.","Maneck, M.; Guenster, C.; Meyer, H.-J.; Heidecke, C.-D.; Rolle, U.",2020-09-27,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.25.20198986,1,Udo Rolle,"Department of Paediatric Surgery and Paediatric Urology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.25.20198986v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.25.20198986v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
19150,"Risk factors for retirement home COVID-19 outbreaks in Ontario, Canada: A population-level cohort study","BackgroundThe epidemiology of COVID-19 in retirement homes (also known as assisted living facilities) is largely unknown. We examined the association between retirement home and community level characteristics and the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks in retirement homes during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic.

MethodsWe conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of licensed retirement homes in Ontario, Canada, from March 1st - September 24th, 2020. Our primary outcome was a COVID-19 outbreak ([&ge;]1 resident or staff confirmed case by validated nucleic acid amplification assay). We used time-dependent proportional hazards methods to model the associations between retirement home and community level characteristics and COVID-19 outbreaks.

ResultsOur cohort included all 770 licensed retirement homes in Ontario, which housed 56,491 residents. There were 172 (22.3%) COVID-19 retirement home outbreaks involving 1,045 (1.9%) residents and 548 staff (1.5%). COVID-19 cases were distributed unevenly across retirement homes, with 1,593 (92.2%) resident and staff cases occurring in 77 (10%) of homes. The adjusted hazard of a COVID-19 outbreak in a retirement home was positively associated with homes that had a large resident capacity, homes that were co-located with a long-term care facility, large corporate owned chains, homes that offered many services onsite, increases in regional COVID-19 incidence, and a higher community-level ethnic concentration.

InterpretationReadily identifiable retirement home-level characteristics are independently associated with COVID-19 outbreaks and may support risk identification. A higher ethnic concentration of the community surrounding a retirement home is associated COVID-19 outbreaks, with an uncertain mechanism.","Costa, A. P.; Manis, D. R.; Jones, A.; Stall, N.

15750,Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) reverses anti-PD-1 immune murine checkpoint blockade: TCF1 as a marker in humans for COVID-19 and HCQ therapy,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a serious threat to global public health. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and the antibiotic azithromycin (AZ) are still being used by thousands and numerous hospitals to treat COVID-19. In a related context, immunotherapy using checkpoint blockade (ICB) with antibodies such as anti-PD-1 has revolutionised cancer therapy. Given that cancer patients on ICB continue to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, an understanding of the effects of HCQ and AZ on the elimination of tumors by anti-PD-1 ICB is urgently needed. In this study, we report that HCQ alone, or in combination with AZ, at doses used to treat COVID-19 patients, reverses the therapeutic benefit of anti-PD-1 in controlling B16 melanoma tumor growth in mice. No deleterious effect was seen on untreated tumors, or in using AZ alone in anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Mechanistically, HCQ and HCQ/AZ inhibited PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, while specifically targeting the anti-PD-1 induced increase in progenitor CD8+CD44+PD-1+TCF1+ tumor-infiltrating T-cells (TILs) and the generation of CD8+CD44+PD-1+ effectors. Surprisingly, it also blocked the appearance of a subset of terminally exhausted CD8+ TILs. No effect was seen on the presence of CD4+ T-cells, FoxP3+ Tregs, thymic subsets, B-cells, antibody production, myeloid cells, or the vasculature of mice. Lastly, we identified TCF-1 expression in peripheral CD8+ T-cells from cancer or non-cancer human patients infected with SARs CoV2 as a marker for the effects of COVID-19 and HCQ on the immune system. This study indicates for the first time that HCQ and HCQ/AZ negatively impact the ability of anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade to promote tumor rejection.","Kreuger, J.; Santinon, F.; Kazanova, A.; Issa, M.; Larrivee, B.; Milhalcioiu, C.; Rudd, C.

9460,Identifying and Ranking Common COVID-19 Symptoms from Arabic Twitter,"BackgroundMassive amount of covid-19 related data is generated everyday by Twitter users. Self-reports of covid-19 symptoms on Twitter can reveal a great deal about the disease and its prevalence in the community. In particular, self-reports can be used as a valuable resource to learn more about the common symptoms and whether their order of appearance differs among different groups in the community. With sufficient available data, this has the potential of developing a covid-19 risk-assessment system that is tailored toward specific group of people.

ObjectiveThe aim of this study is to identify the most common symptoms reported by covid-19 patients in the Arabic language and order the symptoms appearance based on the collected data.

MethodsWe search the Arabic content of Twitter for personal reports of covid-19 symptoms from March 1st to May 27th, 2020. We identify 463 Arabic users who tweeted testing positive for covid-19 and extract the symptoms they publicly associate with covid-19. Furthermore, we ask them directly through personal messages to opt in and rank the appearance of the first three symptoms they experienced right before (or after) diagnosed with covid-19. Finally, we track their Twitter timeline to identify additional symptoms that were mentioned within {+/-}5 days from the day of tweeting having covid-19. In summary, a list of 270 covid-19 reports were collected and symptoms were (at least partially) ranked from early to late.

ResultsThe collected reports contained roughly 900 symptoms originated from 74% (n=201) male and 26% (n=69) female Twitter users. The majority (82%) of the tracked users were living in Saudi Arabia (46%) and Kuwait (36%). Furthermore, 13% (n=36) of the collected reports were asymptomatic. Out of the users with symptoms (n=234), 66% (n=180) provided a chronological order of appearance for at least three symptoms.

Fever 59% (n=139), Headache 43% (n=101), and Anosmia 39% (n=91) were found to be the top three symptoms mentioned by the reports. They count also for the top-3 common first symptoms in a way that 28% (n=65) said their covid journey started with a Fever, 15% (n=34) with a Headache and 12% (n=28) with Anosmia. Out of the Saudi symptomatic reported cases (n=110), the most common three symptoms were Fever 59% (n=65), Anosmia 42% (n=46), and Headache 38% (n=42).

ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that Twitter is a valuable resource to analyze and identify COVID-19 early symptoms within the Arabic content of Twitter. It also suggests the possibility of developing a real-time covid-19 risk estimator based on the users tweets.","Alanazi, E.; Alashaikh, A.; Alqurashi, S.; Alanazi, A.",2020-06-12,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.06.10.20127225,1,Eisa Alanazi,Umm Al-Qura University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.10.20127225v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.10.20127225v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.2196/21329
2365,A preliminary study on serological assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 238 admitted hospital patients,"BackgroundThe outbreak of the recently emerged novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a challenge for public health laboratories. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of serological assay for SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsA newly-developed ELISA assay for IgM and IgG antibodies against N protein of SARS-CoV-2 were used to screen the serums of 238 admitted hospital patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from February 6 to February 14, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by real time RT-PCR on pharyngeal swab specimens.

FindingsOf the 238 patients, 194 (81.5%) were detected to be antibody (IgM and/or IgG) positive, which was significantly higher than the positive rate of viral RNA (64.3%). There was no difference in the positive rate of antibody between the confirmed patients (83.0%, 127/153) and the suspected patients (78.8%, 67/85) whose nucleic acid tests were negative. After the patients were defined to the different stages of disease based on the day when the test samples were collected, the analysis results showed that the antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. After 10 days, the antibody positive rates jumped to above 80% from less than 50%. On the contrary, the positive rates of viral RNA kept above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased. In addition, half of the suspected patients with symptoms for 6-10 days were detected to be antibody positive.

InterpretationThe suspected patients were most likely infected by SARS-CoV-2. Before the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms, nucleic acid test is important for confirmation of viral infection. The combination of serological assay can greatly improve the diagnostic efficacy. After that, the diagnosis for viral infection should be majorly dependent on serological assay.","Liu, L.; Liu, W.; Wang, S.; Zheng, S.",2020-03-08,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.06.20031856,1,Shangen Zheng,General Hospital of Central Theater Command of PLA,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20031856v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20031856v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.micinf.2020.05.008

16551,Characteristics of COVID-19 Clinical Trials in India Based on the Registration Data on CTRI (Clinical Trials Registry- India): a cross-sectional analysis,"ObjectivesThe 2019 pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has prompted several efforts to find safe and effective drugs, but little is understood as to where early efforts were centered. Several clinical trials, both Allopathy and AYUSH medicines have been registered in the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI). We aimed to characterize and extract relevant data registered under CTRI for COVID-19.

Materials and MethodsA cross-sectional analysis was performed of clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 that were registered in the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) from 1st March 2020 to 22nd June 2020. Relevant trial records were downloaded, deduplicated, and independently analyzed by three reviewers.

Main outcomesTrial intervention, design, sponsorship, phase of the trial, and indicated outcomes.

Results233 COVID-19 clinical trials, was registered from India in CTRI. Out of these, 146 were Interventional trials, 84 Observational trials, and three Post-marketing surveillance. Questionnaire and survey-based intervention occupy a significant portion. Randomized control trials are large in number 37.8% than non-randomized. 20% of the trials were recruiting patients, and the Research institution (34%) sponsored more than half of the trials. Global trials are minimal, occupying 3% of total trials and Indian trials were 97%. In most of the trials, the interventional agent is either multiple drug combinations or compound drug formulations compared to single drug administration. Among the trials, 46 Allopathic interventions, 41 Ayurveda interventions, 14 Homeopathy interventions, one in Unani, and 2 in yoga and Naturopathy.

6416,Correlation between prevalence of tobacco smoking and risk and severity of COVID-19 at the national level in the European Union: an ecological study.,"The Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein is the receptor for different coronaviruses, including Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Previous studies suggested the hypothesis that nicotine could downregulate the expression of the ACE2. Due to the high level of nicotine intake, the objective of this preliminary study was to assess, at the ecological level, the correlation between tobacco smoking and the attack rate and severity of COVID-19 in the European Union (EU). We have found that there is a statistically significant negative correlation between the age-standardized prevalence of tobacco smoking and the attack rate of COVID-19 in member states of the EU [Spearmans correlation coefficient = -0.476 (95% confidence interval -0.117, -0.725) (p-value = 0.012)], meaning that in member states with a higher age-standardized prevalence of tobacco smoking the attack rate of COVID-19 has been so far lower. Further research is needed to understand the possible effect of nicotine exposure in the expression of the ACE2 protein.","Gonzalez-Marron, A.; Martinez-Sanchez, J.

We collated the data provided by the Nepalese Ministry of Health and Population and assessed scenario of COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal during the lockdown period. There were only two confirmed cases from 610 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests and no fatalities when the government introduced nationwide lockdown. Nepal had performed 7,791 RT-PCR tests for COVID-19, the highest number of tests during the lockdown. It has recorded its highest daily rise in coronavirus infections with a total of 740 new cases from the total of 4,483 RT-PCR tests performed on a single day. Nepal had reported total 17,994 positive cases and 40 deaths at the end of lockdown. The spatial distribution clearly shows that the cases were rapidly spreading from the southern part of the country where most points of entry and exit from India are located. The Government of Nepal needs to allocate more resources, increase its capacity to test and trace, establish dedicated isolation and quarantine facility and impose local restrictions to manage potential COVID-19 outbreak after easing lockdown.","Sharma, K.; Banstola, A.; Parajuli, R.

14956,Characterization and Phase 1 Trial of a B Cell Activating Anti-CD73 Antibody for the Immunotherapy of COVID-19,"COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has resulted in over 800,000 deaths. Robust humoral anti-viral immune responses have the potential to generate a diverse set of neutralizing antibodies to eliminate viruses and protect against re-infection, transmission, and the evolution of mutations that escape targeted therapeutics. CD73 is present on the majority of human B cells and a subset of T cells where it plays a role in lymphocyte activation and migration. CD73 also functions as an ectoenzyme that converts AMP into adenosine, which can be immunosuppressive. Here we report on CPI-006, a humanized Fc{gamma}R binding-deficient IgG1 anti-CD73 antibody that blocks CD73 enzymatic activity and directly activates CD73+ B cells, inducing differentiation into plasmablasts, immunoglobulin class switching, and antibody secretion independent of adenosine. Immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood from advanced cancer patients receiving CPI-006 revealed evidence of B cell activation, clonal expansion, and development of memory B cells. These immune effects suggested that CPI-006 may be effective at enhancing the magnitude, diversity, and duration of humoral and cellular responses to viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. We have therefore initiated a Phase 1, single-dose, dose-escalation trial in hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. The objectives of this trial are to evaluate the safety of CPI-006 in COVID-19 patients and to determine effects of CPI-006 on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses and the development of memory B cell and T cells. Ten patients have been enrolled in the trial receiving doses of 0.3 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg. All evaluable patients had low pre-treatment serum levels of anti-viral antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein and its receptor binding domain, independent of the duration of their COVID-19 related symptoms prior to enrollment. Anti-viral antibody responses were induced 7 days after CPI-006 treatment and titers continued to rise past Day 56. Increases in the frequency of memory B cells and effector/memory T cells were observed 28 days after treatment. These preliminary results suggest that CPI-006 activates B cells and may enhance and prolong anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in patients with COVID-19. This approach may be useful for treating COVID-19 or as an adjuvant to enhance the efficacy of vaccines.","Willingham, S. B.; Criner, G.; Hill, C.; Hu, S.; Rudnick, J.

3932,Global access to handwashing: implications for COVID-19 control in low-income countries,"BackgroundLow-income countries have reduced health care system capacity and are therefore at risk of substantially higher COVID-19 case fatality rates than those currently seen in high-income countries. Handwashing is a key component of guidance to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior systematic reviews have indicated the effectiveness of handwashing to reduce transmission of respiratory viruses. In low-income countries, reduction of transmission is of paramount importance but social distancing is challenged by high population densities and access to handwashing facilities with soap and water is limited.

ObjectivesTo estimate global access to handwashing with soap and water to inform use of handwashing in the prevention of COVID-19 transmission.

MethodsWe utilized observational surveys and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression modeling in the context of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, to estimate access to a handwashing station with available soap and water for 1062 locations from 1990 to 2019.

ResultsDespite overall improvements from 1990 (33.6% [95% uncertainty interval 31.5-35.6] without access) to 2019, globally in 2019, 2.02 (1.91-2.14) billion people--26.1% (24.7-27.7) of the global population lacked access to handwashing with available soap and water. More than 50% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania were without access to handwashing in 2019, while in eight countries, more 50 million or more persons lacked access.

DiscussionFor populations without handwashing access, immediate improvements in access or alternative strategies are urgently needed, while disparities in handwashing access should be incorporated into COVID-19 forecasting models when applied to low-income countries.

8907,"Association of Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), Adult Pneumococcal and Adult Seasonal Influenza Vaccines with Covid-19 Adjusted Mortality Rates in Level 4 European countries","IntroductionNon-specific effects of vaccines have gained increasing interest during the Covid-19 pandemic. In particular, population use of BCG vaccine has been associated with improved outcomes. This study sought to determine the association of population use of BCG, adult pneumococcal and adult seasonal influenza vaccination with Covid-19 mortality when adjusted for a number of confounding variables.

MethodsUsing publicly available data, mortality adjusted for the timeframe of crisis, population size and population characteristics was calculated. The primary analysis was the relationship between each of the day 15 and day 30 standardised mortality rates and BCG, adult pneumococcal and influenza vaccination scores using unadjusted measures and with adjustment for population structure and case fatality rates. Secondary analyses were measures of case increases and mortality increases from day 15 to day 30 for each of the relative vaccination scores. Finally, we also analysed the peak Z score reflecting increases in total mortality from historical averages reported by EuroMOMO (Euromomo.eu),

ResultsFollowing adjustment for the effects of population size, median age, population density, the proportion of population living in an urban setting, life-expectancy, the elderly dependency ratio (or proportion over 65 years), net migration, days from day 1 to lockdown and case-fatality rate, only BCG vaccination score remained significantly associated with Covid-19 mortality at day 30. In the best fit model, BCG vaccination score was associated with a 64% reduction in log(10) mortality per 10 million population (OR 0.362 reduction [95% CI 0.188 to 0.698]), following adjustment for population size, median age, density, urbanization, elderly dependency ratio, days to lockdown, yearly migration and case fatality rate.

2129,"Clinical characteristics of 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","BackgroundAlthough the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused over 2200 deaths in China, there was no study about death yet. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of non-survivors with COVID-19.

MethodsFor this retrospective, single-center study, we included 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR between Jan 21 and Feb 10, 2020 according to the recommended protocol. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 14, 2020. This study was approved by the ethics commissions of the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan, with a waiver of informed consent due to a public health outbreak investigation.

FindingsWe included 36 patients who died from COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 69.22 years (SD 9.64, range 50-90). 25(69.44%) patients were males, and 11 (30.56%) female. 26 (72.22%) patients had chronic diseases, mainly including hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Patients had common clinical symptoms of fever (34 [94.44%] patients), cough (28 [77.78%] patients), shortness of breath (21 [58.33%] patients), and fatigue (17 [47.22%] patient). Chest computed tomographic scans showed that 31 (96.88%) patients had bilateral pneumonia. Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.67{square}x{square}109/L [SD, 0.33]) occurred in 24 patients (70.59%), decreased albumin (30.18, [SD, 4.76]) in 25 patients (80.65%), elevated D-dimer (8.64 [IQR, 2.39-20]) in 27 patients (100%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (502.5 U/L [IQR, 410-629]) in 26 patients (100%). Nearly all of the patients have elevated CRP (106.3 mg/L [IQR, 60.83-225.3]), PCT (0.61 ng/ml [IQR, 0.16-2.10]) and IL-6 (100.6 pg/ml [IQR, 51.51-919.5]). Most patients received antiviral therapy and antibiotic therapy, and more than half of patients received glucocorticoid therapy (25 [69.44%]). All the patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. One (2.78%) patient presented with acute renal injury. The median time from onset to death was 17 days.

InterpretationLots of patients died from COVID-19 till now. The median survival time of these non-survivors from onset to death was about 2 weeks. Most patients were older males with comorbidities. They finally progressed to ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. Gradually decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation biomarkers were common, and need to be monitored in the routine treatment.

FundingThere is no any funder involved in this study.

Serveral articles that describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of general COVID-19 patients. However, special reports about dead cases of COVID-19 were limited but warranted, considering the large amount of confirmed cases, which is still increasing

Added value of this studyWe retrospectively analysed specific clinical information of 36 non-survivors infected with SARS-CoV-2 in this single-centered study. Most patients were older males with comorbidities. Gradually decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation biomarkers were found in these patients. They finally progressed to ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. The mean survival time in our cohort of COVID-19 non-survivors was about 2 weeks.

Implications of all the available evidenceLots of patients died from COVID-19 till now. The median survival time of these non-survivors from onset to death was about 2 weeks. Most patients were older males with comorbidities. They finally progressed to ARDS. Early detection and intervention of patients are especially important which can delay the development from mild to severe cases.","Huang, Y.; Yang, R.; Xu, Y.; Gong, P.",2020-03-05,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.02.27.20029009,2,Ying Huang,"Department of Oncology, the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20029009v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20029009v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
15630,"Strong impact of closing schools, closing bars and wearing masks during the Covid-19 pandemic: results from a simple and revealing analysis","Many complex mathematical and epidemiological methods have been used to model the Covid-19 pandemic. Among other results from these models has been the view that closing schools had little impact on infection rates in several countries1. We took a different approach. Making one assumption, we simply plotted cases, hospitalizations and deaths, on a log2 Y axis and a linear date-based X axis, and analyzed them using segmented regression, a powerful method that has largely been overlooked during this pandemic. Here we show that the data fit straight lines with correlation coefficients ranging from 92% - 99%, and that these lines broke at interesting intervals, revealing that school closings dropped infection rates in half, lockdowns dropped the rates 3 to 4 fold, and other actions (such as closing bars and mandating masks) brought the rates even further down. Hospitalizations and deaths paralleled cases, with lags of three to ten days. The graphs, which are easy to read, reveal changes in infection rates that are not obvious using other graphing methods, and have several implications for modeling and policy development during this and future pandemics. Overall, other than full lockdowns, three interventions had the most impact: closing schools, closing bars and wearing masks: a message easily understood by the public.","Matzinger, P.; Skinner, J.",2020-09-28,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.26.20202457,1,Polly Matzinger,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.26.20202457v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.26.20202457v1.full.pdf,cc0,NA

8618,Early peak and rapid decline of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a Swiss metropolitan region,"Serological assays can detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, but their sensitivity often comes at the expense of specificity. Here we developed a Tripartite Automated Blood Immunoassay (TRABI) to assess the IgG response against SARS-CoV-2. Calibration was performed with 90 prepandemic and 55 virologically and clinically confirmed COVID-19 samples. Posterior probabilities were calculated from 3x8 measurements of logarithmically diluted samples against the ectodomain and the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and the nucleocapsid protein. We then performed 948528 assays on 5503 prepandemic and 34019 copandemic samples from hospital patients and healthy blood donors. The seroprevalence increased in March 2020 (0.3%; CI95%: 0.1% - 0.5%) among hospital patients but plateaued in April at 1.1-1.3%, and dropped to 0.3-0.7% in July. A dynamic transmission model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and seroconversion in the general population of the Canton of Zurich yielded an infection fatality ratio of 0.6% (CI95%: 0.4%-0.8%), similarly to other European areas. While the evolution of seroprevalence points to a high effectiveness of containment measures, our data highlight that antibody waning warrants a continuous seromonitoring to reliably estimate the prevalence in a population.","Emmenegger, M.; De Cecco, E.; Lamparter, D.; Jacquat, R.

12987,"Characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted to Swedish intensive care units for COVID-19 during the first 60 days of the 2020 pandemic: a registry-based, multicenter, observational study.","BackgroundThe mortality of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 is unclear due to variable censoring and substantial proportions of undischarged patients at follow-up. Nationwide data have not been previously reported. We studied the outcomes of Swedish patients at 30 days after ICU admission.

MethodsWe conducted a registry-based cohort study of all adult patients admitted to Swedish ICUs from 6 March-6 May, 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 disease and complete 30-day follow-up. Data including baseline characteristics, comorbidities, intensive care treatments, organ failures and outcomes were collected. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. A multivariable model was used to determine the independent association between potential predictor variables and the primary outcome.

ResultsA total of 1563 patients were identified. Median ICU length of stay was 12 (5-21) days, and fifteen patients remained in ICU at the time of follow-up. Median age was 61 (52-69), median Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III) was 53 (46-59), and 66{middle dot}8% had at least one comorbidity. Median PaO2/FiO2 on admission was 97{middle dot}5 (75{middle dot}0-140{middle dot}6) mmHg, 74{middle dot}7% suffered from moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The 30-day all-cause mortality was 26{middle dot}7%. The majority of deaths occurred during ICU admission. Age, male sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1{middle dot}5 [1{middle dot}1-2{middle dot}1]), SAPS III score (aOR 1{middle dot}3 [1{middle dot}2-1{middle dot}4]), severe ARDS (aOR 3{middle dot}1 [2{middle dot}0-4{middle dot}8], specific COVID-19 pharmacotherapy (aOR 1{middle dot}4 [1{middle dot}0-1{middle dot}9]), and CRRT (aOR 2{middle dot}2 [1{middle dot}6-3{middle dot}0]), were associated with increased mortality. With the exception of chronic lung disease, the presence of comorbidities was not independently associated with mortality.

ConclusionsThirty-day mortality rate in COVID-19 patients admitted to Swedish intensive care units is generally lower than previously reported. Mortality appears to be driven by age, baseline disease severity, the degree of organ failure and ICU treatment, rather than preexisting comorbidities.

FundingRegion Ostergotland County Council and Linkoping University; number 30320008.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn previous studies reporting outcomes for COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), none reported 30-day mortality rates, many were censored after short observation periods, and most had substantial proportions of undischarged patients at the time of follow-up. Incomplete data may cause bias in reported mortality rates. Further, national data on critically ill patients have not been previously published.

Added value of this studyOur study provides complete 30-day follow up in a nationwide population of 1563 unselected patients admitted to intensive care units in Sweden. All but 15 patients had been discharged from ICU at follow-up thus the study also provides an accurate reflection of ICU mortality. We also provide age-stratified mortality rates and information on ICU treatment and outcomes. This cohort also differs from previous studies in so far as directed antiviral therapy for COVID-19 disease was infrequently used. Adjusted risk estimates for the effect of baseline factors, ICU complications and treatment demonstrate that age, the severity of respiratory failure and need for continuous renal replacement therapy were the most important risk factors for death.

Implications of all the available evidenceMortality rates of COVID-19 patients in Swedish ICUs are lower than those previously reported, despite the high incidence of comorbidities, an ageing population and a high proportion of patients with severe ARDS. Directed antiviral pharmacotherapy was given only to a minority of patients suggesting that survival from COVID-19 in ICU is achievable with good supportive care. Our analysis also suggests that unaccounted factors eg. process and organizational, may be important in determining the outcome of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Our results may be of interest since Sweden has a very limited number of ICU beds and has adopted a unique response to the pandemic compared to other countries. Despite limited numbers of ICU beds per capita, Sweden was able to increase its ICU capacity during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic and provide essential care to the critically ill with encouraging results.","Chew, M.

Correspondingly, this study aims to record the daily COVID 19 cases and continue with the forecasting of the average daily demand (ADD) of healthcare facilities including beds, ICUs, and ventilators using ARIMA model. The forecasts were made for 3 rural populations located in the southern Amazon. The model shows that the healthcare ADD was different in each population. Likewise, the model forecasts that in a rural population that has the highest daily case with projected average cases equal to 67 cases/day (95%CI: 24, 110), that population has to fulfill healthcare ADD consisting of 57 beds/day (95%CI: 21, 93), 8 ICUs/day (95%CI: 2, 14), and 2 ventilators/day (95%CI: 2, 3). To conclude, the ARIMA model has addressed critical questions about ADD for beds, ICUs, and ventilators for rural residents. This ARIMA model based healthcare plan will hopefully provide versatile tool to improve healthcare resource allocations.","Adwibowo, A.",2020-06-07,Health Systems And Quality Improvement,10.1101/2020.06.05.20123380,1,Andrio Adwibowo,University of Indonesia,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.05.20123380v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.05.20123380v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

Further, heterogeneity in disease outcomes is influenced by race, though the relative contributions of structural/social and genetic factors remain unclear.1,2 Very recent unpublished work has identified two genetic risk loci that confer greater risk for respiratory failure in COVID-19: the ABO locus and the 3p21.31 locus.3 To understand how these loci might confer risk and whether this differs by race, we utilized proteomic profiling and genetic information from three cohorts including black and white participants to identify proteins influenced by these loci. We observed that variants in the ABO locus are associated with levels of CD209/DC-SIGN, a known binding protein for SARS-CoV and other viruses,4 as well as multiple inflammatory and thrombotic proteins, while the 3p21.31 locus is associated with levels of CXCL16, a known inflammatory chemokine.5 Thus, integration of genetic information and proteomic profiling in biracial cohorts highlights putative mechanisms for genetic risk in COVID-19 disease.","Katz, D.

There is an urgent need for methods that can rapidly detect and sequence SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously. Here we describe a method for multiplex isothermal amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in 20 minutes. Based on this, we developed NIRVANA (Nanopore sequencing of Isothermal Rapid Viral Amplification for Near real-time Analysis) to detect viral sequences and monitor mutations in multiple regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome for up to 96 patients at a time. NIRVANA uses a newly developed algorithm for on-the-fly data analysis during Nanopore sequencing. The whole workflow can be completed in as short as 3.5 hours, and all reactions can be done in a simple heating block. NIRVANA provides a rapid field-deployable solution of SARS-CoV-2 detection and surveillance of pandemic strains.","Bi, C.; Ramos-Mandujano, G.; Hala, S.; Xu, J.; Mfarrej, S.; Tian, Y.; Rodriguez Esteban, C.; Nunez Delicado, E.; Alofi, F.

4928,The current COVID-19 wave will likely be mitigated in the second-line European countries,"ObjectiveCountries presently apply different strategies to control the COVID-19 outbreak. Differences in population structures, decision making, health systems and numerous other factors result in various trajectories in terms of mortality at country scale. Our objective in this manuscript is to disentangle the future of second-line European countries (i.e. countries that present, today, a moderate death rate) with respect to the current COVID-19 wave.

MethodWe propose a data-driven approach, grounded on a mixture model, to forecast the dynamics of the number of deaths from COVID-19 in a given focal country using data from countries that are ahead in time in terms of COVID-19-induced mortality. In this approach, the mortality curves of ahead-in-time countries are used to build predictors, which are then used as the components of the mixture model. This approach was applied to eight second-line European countries (Austria, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Sweden), using Belgium, France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom as well as the Hubei province in China to build predictors. For this analysis, we used data pooled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.

ResultsIn general, the second-line European countries tend to follow relatively mild mortality curves (typically, those of Switzerland and Hubei) rather than fast and severe ones (typically, those of Spain, Italy, Belgium, France and the United Kingdom). From a methodological viewpoint, the performance of our forecasting approach is about 80% up to 8 days in the future, as soon as the focal country has accumulated at least two hundreds of deaths.

DiscussionOur results suggest that the continuation of the current COVID-19 wave across Europe will likely be mitigated, and not as strong as it was in most of the front-line countries first impacted by the wave.","Soubeyrand, S.; Ribaud, M.; Baudrot, V.; Allard, D.; Pommeret, D.; Roques, L.",2020-04-22,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.17.20069179,1,Samuel Soubeyrand,INRAE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069179v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069179v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
14513,COVID-19 superspreading in cities versus the countryside,"So far, the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterised by an initial rapid rise in new cases followed by a peak and a more erratic behaviour that varies between regions. This is not easy to reproduce with traditional SIR models, which predict a more symmetric epidemic. Here, we argue that superspreaders and population heterogeneity are the core factors explaining this discrepancy. We do so through an agent-based lattice model of a disease spreading in a heterogeneous population. We predict that an epidemic driven by superspreaders will spread rapidly in cities, but not in the countryside where the sparse population limits the maximal number of secondary infections. This suggests that mitigation strategies should include restrictions on venues where people meet a large number of strangers. Furthermore, mitigating the epidemic in cities and in the countryside may require different levels of restrictions.","Eilersen, A.; Sneppen, K.",2020-10-14,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.04.20188359,2,Kim Sneppen,University of Copenhagen,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188359v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188359v2.full.pdf,cc_by,NA

This approach was implemented in the metropolitan area of A Coruna (NW Spain), where wastewater from the treatment plant of Bens was analyzed to track the epidemics dynamic in a population of 369,098 inhabitants. We developed statistical regression models that allowed us to estimate the number of infected people from the viral load detected in the wastewater with a reliability close to 90%. This is the first wastewater-based epidemiological model that could potentially be adapted to track the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic anywhere in the world, monitoring both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.

12702,The characteristics of multi-source mobility datasets and how they reveal the luxury nature of social distancing in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic,"This study reveals the human mobility from various sources and the luxury nature of social distancing in the U.S during the COVID-19 pandemic by highlighting the disparities in mobility dynamics from lower-income and upper-income counties. We collect, process, and compute mobility data from four sources: 1) Apple mobility trend reports, 2) Google community mobility reports, 3) mobility data from Descartes Labs, and 4) Twitter mobility calculated via weighted distance. We further design a Responsive Index (RI) based on the time series of mobility change percentages to quantify the general degree of mobility-based responsiveness to COVID-19 at the U.S. county level. We find statistically significant positive correlations in the RI between either two data sources, revealing their general similarity, albeit with varying Pearsons r coefficients. Despite the similarity, however, mobility from each source presents unique and even contrasting characteristics, in part demonstrating the multifaceted nature of human mobility. The positive correlation between RI and income at the county level is significant in all mobility datasets, suggesting that counties with higher income tend to react more aggressively in terms of reducing more mobility in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most states present a positive difference in RI between their upper-income and lower-income counties, where diverging patterns in time series of mobility changes percentages can be found. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that cross-compares multi-source mobility datasets. The findings shed light on not only the characteristics of multi-source mobility data but also the mobility patterns in tandem with the economic disparity.

We propose herein to evaluate the impact of implementing conservative management as an alternative approach to surgical appendectomy in the treatment of proven acute appendicitis during COVID19 pandemic. Methods Our study is a prospective multicenter study that includes a cohort of 160 patients admitted to the surgical departments in both Tawam Hospital and Sheikh Shakhbout Medical City, Abu Dhabi, UAE, for the period from February 2020 till July 2020. Results Our results showed that 56 of our patients (35%) were treated conservatively, while the other 104 (65%) underwent operative management. There was a significant decrease in length of hospital stay (LOS) (2.32 days) among the first group compared to the second (2.8 days). Also, short term follow-up showed that 90% of those patients did not require further operative intervention or developed any serious complications. Out of the 110 patients that were swapped for COVID19, nine (8.18%) were confirmed to be positive. Our protocol was to avoid surgical management for COVID19 positive patients unless indicated. This resulted in (8/9) of COVID19 positive patients to be treated conservatively. Follow up was achieved by using telemedicine-based follow-up with the aim of empowering social distancing and reducing risk of viral exposure to patients as well as the health care providers. In conclusion, our results showed that the implementation of conservative management in treating patients with acute appendicitis who were COVID19 positive is a safe and feasible approach that maybe essential in reducing viral transmission risks as well as avoiding operative risks on COVID19 positive patients.","Al Hashmi, F.

6210,A strategy for finding people infected with SARS-CoV-2: optimizing pooled testing at low prevalence,"Suppressing SARS-CoV-2 will likely require the rapid identification and isolation of infected individuals, on an ongoing basis. RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) tests are accurate but costly, making regular testing of every individual expensive. The costs are a challenge for all countries and particularly for developing countries. Cost reductions can be achieved by pooling (or combining) subsamples and testing them in groups. We propose an algorithm for pooling subsamples based on the geometry of a hypercube that, at low prevalence, uniquely identifies infected individuals in a small number of tests. We discuss the optimal group size and explain why, given the highly infectious nature of the disease, largely parallel searches are preferred. We report proof of concept experiments in which a positive subsample was detected even when diluted a hundred-fold with negative subsamples. Using these methods, the costs of mass testing could be reduced by a large factor. If infected individuals are quickly and effectively quarantined, the prevalence will fall and so will the cost of regular, mass testing. Such a strategy provides a possible pathway to the longterm elimination of SARS-CoV-2. Field trials of our approach are now under way in Rwanda.","Mutesa, L.; Ndishimye, P.; Butera, Y.; Souopgui, J.; Uwineza, A.; Rutayisire, R.; Musoni, E.; Rujeni, N.; Nyatanyi, T.; Ntagwabira, E.; Semakula, M.; Musanabaganwa, C.; Nyamwasa, D.; Ndashimye, M.; Ujeneza, E.; Mwikarago, I.

12548,Rapid real-time tracking of non-pharmaceutical interventions and their association with SARS-CoV-2 positivity: The COVID-19 Pandemic Pulse Study,"BackgroundCurrent mitigation strategies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rely on population-wide adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Collecting demographically and geographically resolved data on NPIs and their association with SARS-CoV-2 infection history can provide critical information related to reopening geographies.

MethodsWe sampled 1,030 individuals in Maryland from June 17 - June 28, 2020 to capture socio-demographically and geographically resolved information about NPI adoption, access to SARS-CoV-2 testing, and examine associations with self-reported SARS-CoV-2 positivity.

ResultsMedian age of the sample was 43 years and 45% were men; Whites and Blacks/African Americans represented 60% and 23%, respectively. Overall, 96% of the sample reported traveling outside their home for non-employment related services: most commonly cited reasons were essential services (92%) and visiting friends/family (66%). Use of public transport was reported by 18% of respondents. 68% reported always social distancing indoors and 53% always wearing masks indoors; indoor social distancing was significantly less common among younger vs. older individuals, and race/ethnicity and income were significantly associated with mask use (p<0.05 for all). 55 participants (5.3%) self-reported ever testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with strong dose-response relationships between movement frequency and SARS-CoV-2 positivity that were significantly attenuated by social distancing. In multivariable analysis, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was negatively associated with the practice of social distancing (adjusted Odd Ratio [aOR]: 0.10; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.03 - 0.33); the only travel associated with higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection was use of public transport (aOR for [&ge;]7 times vs. never: 4.29) and visiting a place of worship (aOR for [&ge;]3 times vs. never: 16.0) after adjusting for social distancing.

ConclusionsUsing a rapid cost-efficient approach, we highlight the role of movement and social distancing on SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk. Continued monitoring of NPI uptake, access to testing, and the subsequent impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmission will be critical for pandemic control and decisions about reopening geographies.

2298,The impact of social distancing and epicenter lockdown on the COVID-19 epidemic in mainland China: A data-driven SEIQR model study,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which originated in Wuhan, China, constitutes a public health emergency of international concern with a very high risk of spread and impact at the global level. We developed data-driven susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine-recovered (SEIQR) models to simulate the epidemic with the interventions of social distancing and epicenter lockdown. Population migration data combined with officially reported data were used to estimate model parameters, and then calculated the daily exported infected individuals by estimating the daily infected ratio and daily susceptible population size. As of Jan 01, 2020, the estimated initial number of latently infected individuals was 380.1 (95%-CI: 379.8[~]381.0). With 30 days of substantial social distancing, the reproductive number in Wuhan and Hubei was reduced from 2.2 (95%-CI: 1.4[~]3.9) to 1.58 (95%-CI: 1.34[~]2.07), and in other provinces from 2.56 (95%-CI: 2.43[~]2.63) to 1.65 (95%-CI: 1.56[~]1.76). We found that earlier intervention of social distancing could significantly limit the epidemic in mainland China. The number of infections could be reduced up to 98.9%, and the number of deaths could be reduced by up to 99.3% as of Feb 23, 2020. However, earlier epicenter lockdown would partially neutralize this favorable effect. Because it would cause in situ deteriorating, which overwhelms the improvement out of the epicenter. To minimize the epidemic size and death, stepwise implementation of social distancing in the epicenter city first, then in the province, and later the whole nation without the epicenter lockdown would be practical and cost-effective.","Zhang, Y.; Jiang, B.; Yuan, J.; Tao, Y.",2020-03-06,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.04.20031187,1,Yanyun Tao,Soochow University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031187v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031187v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
17593,Seroprevalence of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in a Cohort of New York City Metro Blood Donors using Multiple SARS-CoV-2 Serological Assays: Implications for Controlling the Epidemic and Reopening.,"Projections of the stage of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and local, regional and national public health policies designed to limit the spread of the epidemic as well as ""reopen"" cities and states, are best informed by serum neutralizing antibody titers measured by reproducible, high throughput, and statically credible antibody (Ab) assays. To date, a myriad of Ab tests, both available and authorized for emergency use by the FDA, has led to confusion rather than insight per se. The present study reports the results of a rapid, point-in-time 1,000-person cohort study using serial blood donors in the New York City metropolitan area (NYC) using multiple serological tests, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and high throughput serological assays (HTSAs). These were then tested and associated with assays for neutralizing Ab (NAb). Of the 1,000 NYC blood donor samples in late June and early July 2020, 12.1% and 10.9% were seropositive using the Ortho Total Ig and the Abbott IgG HTSA assays, respectively. These serological assays correlated with neutralization activity specific to SARS-CoV-2. The data reported herein suggest that seroconversion in this population occurred in approximately 1 in 8 blood donors from the beginning of the pandemic in NYC (considered March 1, 2020). These findings deviate with an earlier seroprevalence study in NYC showing 13.7% positivity. Collectively however, these data demonstrate that a low number of individuals have serologic evidence of infection during this ""first wave"" and suggest that the notion of ""herd immunity"" at rates of [~]60% or higher are not near. Furthermore, the data presented herein show that the nature of the Ab-based immunity is not invariably associated with the development of NAb. While the blood donor population may not mimic precisely the NYC population as a whole, rapid assessment of seroprevalence in this cohort and serial reassessment could aid public health decision making.","Jin, D.

9014,Mechanical ventilation utilization in COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundIn December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 caused a global pandemic with a viral infection called COVID-19. The disease usually causes respiratory symptoms but in a small proportion of patients can lead to a pneumonitis, Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome and death. Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV) is considered a life-saving treatment for COVID-19 patients and a huge demand for IMV devices was reported globally. This review aims to provide insight on the initial IMV practises for COVID-19 patients in the initial phase of the pandemic.

MethodsElectronic databases (Embase and MEDLINE) were searched for applicable articles using relevant keywords. The references of included articles were hand searched. Articles that reported the use of IMV in adult COVID-19 patients were included in the review. The NIH quality assessment tool for cohort and cross-sectional studies was used to appraise studies.

Results106 abstracts were identified from the databases search, of which 16 were included. 5 studies were included in the meta-analysis. In total, 9988 patients were included across all studies. The overall cases of COVID-19 requiring IMV ranged from 2-77%. Increased age and pre-existing comorbidities increased the likelihood of IMV requirement. The reported mortality rate in patients receiving IMV ranged between 50-100%. On average, IMV was required and initiated between 10-10.5 days from symptoms onset. When invasively ventilated, COVID-19 patients required IMV for a median of 10-17 days across studies. Little information was provided on ventilatory protocols or management strategies and were inconclusive.

ConclusionIn these initial reporting studies for the first month of the pandemic, patients receiving IMV were older and had more pre-existing co-morbidities than those who did not require IMV. The mortality rate was high in COVID-19 patients who received IMV. Studies are needed to evaluate protocols and modalities of IMV to improve outcomes and identify the populations most likely to benefit from IMV.","Almeshari, M. A.; Alobaidi, N.

15236,Uncovering clinical risk factors and prediction of severe COVID-19: A machine learning approach based on UK Biobank data,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is a major public health concern. Given the extent of the pandemic, it is urgent to identify risk factors associated with disease severity. Accurate prediction of those at risk of developing severe infections is also of high clinical importance.

MethodsBased on the UK Biobank(UKBB data), we built machine learning(ML) models to predict the risk of developing severe or fatal infections, and to evaluate major risk factors involved. We first restricted the analysis to infected subjects(N=7846), then performed analysis at a population level, considering those with no known infection as controls(N for controls=465,728). Hospitalization was used as a proxy for severity. Totally 97 clinical variables(collected prior to COVID-19 outbreak) covering demographic variables, comorbidities, blood measurements(e.g. hematological/liver/renal function/metabolic parameters etc.), anthropometric measures and other risk factors (e.g. smoking/drinking habits) were included as predictors. We also constructed a simplified ( lite) prediction model using 27 covariates that can be more easily obtained (demographic and comorbidity data). XGboost (gradient boosted trees) was used for prediction and predictive performance was assessed by cross-validation. Variable importance was quantified by Shapley values and accuracy gain. Shapley dependency and interaction plots were used to evaluate the pattern of relationship between risk factors and outcomes.

ResultsA total of 2386 severe and 477 fatal cases were identified. For the analysis among infected individuals (N=7846),our prediction model achieved AUCs of 0.723(95% CI:0.711-0.736) and 0.814(CI: 0.791-0.838) for severe and fatal infections respectively. The top five contributing factors for severity were age, number of drugs taken(cnt_tx), cystatin C(reflecting renal function), wait-hip ratio (WHR) and Townsend Deprivation index (TDI). For prediction of mortality, the top features were age, testosterone, cnt_tx, waist circumference(WC) and red cell distribution width (RDW).

In analyses involving the whole UKBB population, the corresponding AUCs for severity and fatality were 0.696(CI:0.684-0.708) and 0.802(CI:0.778-0.826) respectively. The same top five risk factors were identified for both outcomes, namely age, cnt_tx, WC, WHR and TDI. Apart from the above features, Type 2 diabetes(T2DM), HbA1c and apolipoprotein A were ranked among the top 10 in at least two (out of four) analyses. Age, cystatin C, TDI and cnt_tx were among the top 10 across all four analyses.

As for the  lite models, the predictive performances in terms of AUC are broadly similar, with estimated AUCs of 0.716, 0.818, 0.696 and 0.811 respectively. The top-ranked variables were similar to above, including for example age, cnt_tx, WC, male and T2DM.

ConclusionsWe identified a number of baseline clinical risk factors for severe/fatal infection by an ML approach. For example, age, central obesity, impaired renal function, multi-comorbidities and cardiometabolic abnormalities may predispose to poorer outcomes. The presented prediction models may be useful at a population level to help identify those susceptible to developing severe/fatal infections, hence facilitating targeted prevention strategies. Further replications in independent cohorts are required to verify our findings.","Wong, K. C.

The adaptation of preventive measures to limit the spread of infection among the people is the best solution to this health issue. The identification of infected cases and their isolation from healthy people is one of the most important preventive measures. In this regard, screening of the samples from a large number of people is needed which requires a lot of reagent kits for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The use of smart pooled sample testing with the help of algorithms may be a quite useful strategy in the current prevailing scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic.

11948,Temporal dynamics of human respiratory and gut microbiomes during the course of COVID-19 in adults,"SARS-CoV-2 infects multiple organs including the respiratory tract and gut. Whether regional microbiomes are disturbed significantly to affect the disease progression of COVID-19 is largely unknown. To address this question, we performed cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of throat and anal swabs from 35 COVID-19 adults and 15 controls by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results allowed a partitioning of patients into 3-4 categories (I-IV) with distinct microbial community types in both sites. Lower-diversity community types often appeared in the early phase of COVID-19, and synchronous fast restoration of both the respiratory and gut microbiomes from early dysbiosis towards late near-normal was observed in 6/8 mild COVID-19 adult patients despite they had a relatively slow clinical recovery. The synchronous shift of the community types was associated with significantly positive bacterial interactions between the respiratory tract and gut, possibly along the airway-gut axis. These findings reveal previously unknown interactions between respiratory and gut microbiomes, and suggest that modulations of regional microbiota might help to improve the recovery from COVID-19 in adult patients.","Xu, R.; Lu, R.; Zhang, T.; Wu, Q.; Cai, W.; Han, X.; Jin, X.; Zhang, Z.; Zhang, C.; Wan, Z.",2020-07-22,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.07.21.20158758,1,Chiyu Zhang,Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20158758v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20158758v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
18268,ANTIBODY RESPONSE TO COVID-19 INFECTION- CLINICAL VARIABLES AT PLAY,"BackgroundThe current COVID19 pandemic began in December 2019 and rapidly expanded to become a global pandemic. The COVID 19 presents multitude of clinical disorders, ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe disease, which can accompanied by multisystem failure leading to death. The immune response to SARS CoV 2 is understood to involve all the components of the system that together causes viral elimination and recovery from the infection. However, such immune responses implicated in the disease has varied presentation ranging from mild to a severe form, which appears to hinge on the loss of the immune regulation between protective and altered responses. In this study, we want to unravel this association of immune responses to various clinical variables, which might have a major role to play, while generating the immune response. The objective was to test this hypothesis in our settings and comparing the results of serologic tests from a group of COVID 19 patients and will analyzed the disease severity in comparison.

MethodsTesting for SARS COV2 IgG Antibody was done with chemiluminescent assay on the Ortho Clinical Diagnostics (OCD) Vitros 5600 platform.

ResultsA total of 106 COVID 19 patients were included in this study, of whom 61 were male and 45 were female. Their mean age was 43.7 years (range 17-83) and the median interval between initial symptom onset and sample collection was 12.33 days. Eighty patients (82%) had mild or moderate symptoms and twenty-six patients (18%) had severe symptoms. The antibody titers were positive in 99 patients (93%) and were found negative in 7 patients (7%). When comparing patients with mild/moderate symptoms and patients with severe/critical diseases, no statistically significant difference was observed between their gender ratios (P = 0.373) and age composition (P = 0.224).

ConclusionsThe data presented in this research study did not find any statistical significance between SARS CoV 2 IgG antibody levels with COVID 19 disease severity, duration of symptoms, age, gender, and length of convalescence.","Parkash, A.; Singla, P.; Bhatia, M.",2020-11-23,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.11.20.20234500,1,Anuj Parkash,RAJIV GANDHI CANCER INSTITUTE AND RESEARCH CENTRE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.20.20234500v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.20.20234500v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

Effects of earlier or delayed interventions in the US and the UK are experimented which show at least 75% (29%) less infections and deaths can be attained for the US (the UK) under a Five-Day Earlier experiment. The impacts of two removal regimes (Korea and Italy) on the total infection and death tolls on the other countries are compared with the natural forecast ones, which suggest there are still ample opportunity for countries to reduce the final death numbers by improving the removal process.","Gu, J.; Yan, H.; Huang, Y.; Zhu, Y.; Sun, H.; Zhang, X.; Wang, Y.; Qiu, Y.; Chen, S.",2020-05-03,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.27.20081232,1,Song Chen,Peking University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.27.20081232v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.27.20081232v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
1693,Assessing the plausibility of subcritical transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States,"The 2019-nCoV outbreak has raised concern of global spread. While person-to-person transmission within the Wuhan district has led to a large outbreak, the transmission potential outside of the region remains unclear. Here we present a simple approach for determining whether the upper limit of the confidence interval for the reproduction number exceeds one for transmission in the United States, which would allow endemic transmission. As of February 7, 2020, the number of cases in the United states support subcritical transmission, rather than ongoing transmission. However, this conclusion can change if pre-symptomatic cases resulting from human-to-human transmission have not yet been identified.","Blumberg, S.; Lietman, T. M.; Porco, T.

15899,Validation of self-collected buccal swab and saliva as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19,"BackgroundEffective management of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires large-scale testing. Collection of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) by healthcare workers (HCW) is currently used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2, which increases the risk of transmission to HCWs. Self-administered saliva and buccal swabs are convenient, painless and safe alternative sample collection methods.

MethodsA cross-sectional single centre study was conducted on 42 participants who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via NPS within the past 7 days. A self-collected saliva and buccal swab and a HCW-collected NPS were obtained. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed and cycle threshold (CT) values were obtained. Positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA) and overall agreement (OA) were calculated for saliva and buccal swabs, as compared with NPS.

ResultsAmong the 42 participants, 73.8% (31/42) tested positive via any one of the 3 tests. With reference to NPS, the saliva test had PPA 66.7%, NPA 91.7% and OA 69.0%. The buccal swab had PPA 56.7%, NPA 100% and OA 73.8%. Presence of symptoms improved diagnostic accuracy. There was no statistically significant association between CT values and duration of symptom onset within the first 12 days of symptoms for all three modalities.

ConclusionSelf-collected saliva tests and buccal swabs have only moderate agreement with HCW-collected NPS swabs. Primary screening for SARS-CoV-2 may be performed with a saliva test or buccal swab, with a negative test warranting a confirmatory NPS to avoid false negatives. This combined strategy minimizes discomfort and reduces the risk of spread to the community and HCWs.","Ku, C. W.; Durai, S.; Kwan, J. Q. T.; Loy, S. L.; Erwin, C.; Ko, K. K. K.; Ng, X.

6924,The far side of the COVID-19 epidemic curve: local re-openings and re-closings based on globally coordinated triggers may work best,"In the late stages of an epidemic, infections are often sporadic and geographically distributed. Spatially structured stochastic models can capture these important features of disease dynamics, thereby allowing a broader exploration of interventions. Here we develop a stochastic model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission amongst an interconnected group of population centres representing counties, municipalities and districts (collectively, ""counties""). The model is parameterized with demographic, epidemiological, testing, and travel data from Ontario, Canada. We explore the effects of different control strategies after the epidemic curve has been flattened. We compare a local strategy of re-opening (and re-closing, as needed) schools and workplaces county-by-county according to triggers for county-specific infection prevalence, to a global strategy of province-wide re-opening and re-closing according to triggers for province-wide infection prevalence. We find that the local strategy results in a similar number coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases but significantly fewer person-days of closure, even under high inter-county travel scenarios. However, both cases and person-days lost to closure rise when county triggers are not coordinated and when testing rates vary among counties. Finally, we show that local strategies can also do better in the early epidemic stage but only if testing rates are high and the trigger prevalence is low. Our results suggest that pandemic planning for the far side of the COVID-19 epidemic curve should consider local strategies for re-opening and re-closing.","Karatayev, V.; Anand, M.; Bauch, C.

13301,Comprehensive analysis of the key epidemiological parameters to evaluate the impact of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 pandemic,"Globally, the heterogenous coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case fatality rate (CFR) could be influenced by various epidemiological parameters. Identifying these could help formulate effective public health strategies. Incidence and mortality of COVID-19 for each of the 220 countries as on July 30, 2020 were evaluated against key epidemiological variables, namely - BCG vaccination (ongoing vs. discontinued/never undertaken), %population aged [&ge;]65 years, incidences of ischemic heart disease (IHD), hypertensive heart disease (HHD), cancer, malaria, and diabetes; human development index (HDI) and population density. These were retrieved from the public domains of WHO, UN, World Bank and published reports. The COVID-19 CFRs ranged between 0.0% and 28.3% (mean {+/-} SD: 3.05% {+/-} 3.48). The influence of the individual epidemiological parameters on CFR were evaluated through the event rate estimations. A significantly lower event rate was observed in countries with ongoing BCG vaccination program (ER: with vs without ongoing BCG vaccination: 0.020 vs 0.034, p<0.001). The type of BCG strains used also influenced the ER; this being 0.018, 0.031 and 0.019 for early, late and mixed strains respectively (p=0.008). The epidemiological variables significantly associated with higher COVID-19 event rate were countries with higher %population aged [&ge;]65 years (p<0.001), greater incidence of IHD (p<0.001) and cancer (p=0.003) and better HDI (p=0.003). Incidences of malaria, HHD and diabetes along with population density had no significant impact on COVID-19 CFR. Further, BCG vaccination significantly lowered the COVID-19 ER in each of the high-risk population subgroups - countries with >7.1% population aged [&ge;]65 years (p=0.008), >0.737 HDI (p=0.001), IHD >1171/105 population (p=0.004) and cancer incidence >15726 (p<0.001). The results supports BCG induced ""trained immunity"" leading to heterologous immunoprotection against COVID-19. Thus BCG vaccination with early strains could provide a cost-effective prophylaxis, especially in high-risk individuals and bridge the gap till an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is freely available globally.","Datta, N.

16651,Real-life validation of the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test (Abbott) in community-dwelling subjects with symptoms of potential SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundRT-qPCR is the reference test for identification of active SARS-CoV-2 infection, but is associated with diagnostic delay. Antigen detection assays can generate results within 20 minutes and outside of laboratory settings. Yet, their diagnostic test performance in real life settings has not been determined.

MethodsThe diagnostic value of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott), was determined in comparison to RT-qPCR (Seegene Allplex) in community-dwelling mildly symptomatic subjects in a medium (Utrecht, the Netherlands) and high endemic area (Aruba), using two concurrently obtained nasopharyngeal swabs.

Findings1367 and 208 subjects were enrolled in Utrecht and Aruba, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, based on RT-qPCR, was 10.2% (n=139) and 30.3% (n=63) in Utrecht and Aruba respectively. Specificity of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test was 100% (95%CI: 99.7-100%) in both settings. Test sensitivity was 72.6% (95%CI: 64.5-79.9%) in the Netherlands and 81.0% (95% CI: 69.0-89.8%) in Aruba. Probability of false negative results was associated with RT-qPCR Ct-values, but not with duration of symptoms. Restricting RT-qPCR test positivity to Ct-values <32 yielded test sensitivities of 95.2% (95%CI: 89.3-98.5%) in the Netherlands and 98.0% (95%CI: 89.2-99.95%) in Aruba.

InterpretationIn community-dwelling subjects with mild respiratory symptoms the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test had 100% specificity, and a sensitivity above 95% for nasopharyngeal samples when using Ct values <32 cycles as cut-off for RT-qPCR test positivity. Considering short turnaround times, user friendliness, low costs and opportunities for decentralized testing, this test can improve our efforts to control transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

5208,Heat treatment for reuse of disposable respirators during Covid-19 pandemic: Is filtration and fit adversely affected?,"A number of methods for decontaminating disposable filtering face piece respirators have been explored for use in health care settings during epidemics where respirators are in short supply, such as the current Covid-19 pandemic. Heating to temperatures above 65{degrees}C has been shown to successfully inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus on various surfaces. Ovens or similar heating devices are likely already widely available in hospitals globally. We did a quantitative fit test on nine models of FFP2 and FFP3 respirators before and after heat treatment in an oven. These included both flat fold and moulded cup styles. All passed the initial fit test, and all but two passed the post-treatment fit test. This study demonstrates that FFP respirators can still retain both filtration efficiency and fit after wear and heat treatment, but that it is necessary to understand the probability for failure of fit after decontamination. Heat shows promise as a simple and effective way of treating FFP respirators. Further evaluation of longer-term wear and disinfection effectiveness of heat treatment should be done before widespread use.","Loh, M.; Clark, R.; Cherrie, J.

12704,Low-Cost Enhancement of Facial Mask Filtration to Prevent Transmission of COVID-19,"The use of face masks is recommended worldwide to reduce the spread of COVID-19. A plethora of facial coverings and respirators, both commercial and homemade, pervade the market, but the true filtration capabilities of many homemade measures against the virus are unclear and continue to be unexplored. In this work, we compare the efficacy of the following masks in keeping out particulate matter below 2.5 microns: N95 respirators, surgical masks, cloth masks, cloth masks with activated carbon air filters, cloth masks with HVAC air filters, lightly starch-enhanced cloth masks, and heavily-starched cloth masks. The experiments utilize an inhalation system and aerosol chamber to simulate a masked individual respiring aerosolized air. COVID-19 disproportionately affects people in low-income communities, who often lack the resources to acquire appropriate personal protective equipment and tend to lack the flexibility to shelter in place due to their public-facing occupations. This work tests low-cost enhancements to homemade masks to assist these communities in making better masks to reduce viral transmission. Experimental results demonstrate that the filtration efficacy of cloth masks with either a light or heavy starch can approach the performance of much costlier masks. This discovery supports the idea of low-cost enhancements to reduce transmission and protect individuals from contracting COVID-19.","Bhimaraju, H.; Nag, N.; Jain, R.",2020-08-04,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.08.01.20166637,1,Nitish Nag,"University of California, Irvine",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.01.20166637v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.01.20166637v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
9617,COVID-19 infections among Healthcare Workers and Transmission within Households,"ImportanceProtecting healthcare workers (HCWs) from COVID-19 is a priority to maintain a safe and functioning healthcare system. The risk of transmitting COVID-19 to family members is a source of stress for many.

ObjectiveTo describe and compare HCW and non-HCW COVID-19 cases in Ontario, Canada, as well as the frequency of COVID-19 among HCWs household members.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsUsing reportable disease data at Public Health Ontario which captures all COVID-19 cases in Ontario, Canada, we conducted a population-based cross-sectional study comparing demographic, exposure, and clinical variables between HCWs and non-HCWs with COVID-19 as of 14 May 2020. We calculated rates of infections over time and determined the frequency of within household transmissions using natural language processing based on residential address.

Exposures and OutcomesWe contrasted age, gender, comorbidities, clinical presentation (including asymptomatic and presymptomatic), exposure histories including nosocomial transmission, and clinical outcomes between HCWs and non-HCWs with confirmed COVID-19.

ResultsThere were 4,230 (17.5%) HCW COVID-19 cases in Ontario, of whom 20.2% were nurses, 2.3% were physicians, and the remaining 77.4% other specialties. HCWs were more likely to be between 30-60 years of age and female. HCWs were more likely to present asymptomatically (8.1% versus 7.0%, p=0.010) or with atypical symptoms (17.8% versus 10.5%, p<0.001). The mortality among HCWs was 0.2% compared to 10.5% of non-HCWs. HCWs commonly had exposures to a confirmed case or outbreak (74.1%), however only 3.1% were confirmed to be nosocomial. The rate of new infections was 5.5 times higher in HCWs than non-HCWs, but mirrored the epidemic curve. We identified 391 (9.8%) probable secondary household transmissions and 143 (3.6%) acquisitions. Children < 19 years comprised 14.6% of secondary cases compared to only 4.2% of the primary cases.

Conclusions and RelevanceHCWs represent a disproportionate number of COVID-19 cases in Ontario but with low confirmed numbers of nosocomial transmission. The data support substantial testing bias and under-ascertainment of general population cases. Protecting HCWs through appropriate personal protective equipment and physical distancing from colleagues is paramount.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the differences between healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers with COVID-19?

9348,Bayesian investigation of SARS-CoV-2-related mortality in France,"The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France has focused a lot of attention as it has had one of the largest death tolls in Europe. It provides an opportunity to examine the effect of the lockdown and of other events on the dynamics of the epidemic. In particular, it has been suggested that municipal elections held just before lockdown was ordered may have helped spread the virus. In this manuscript we use Bayesian models of the number of deaths through time to study the epidemic in 13 regions of France. We found that the models accurately predict the number of deaths 2 to 3 weeks in advance, and recover estimates that are in agreement with recent models that rely on a different structure and different input data. In particular, the lockdown reduced the viral reproduction number by {approx} 80%. However, using a mixture model, we found that the lockdown had had different effectiveness depending on the region, and that it had been slightly more effective in decreasing the reproduction number in denser regions. The mixture model predicts that 2.08 (95% CI: 1.85-2.47) million people had been infected by May 11, and that there were 2567 (95% CI: 1781-5182) new infections on May 10. We found no evidence that the reproduction numbers differ between week-ends and week days, and no evidence that the reproduction numbers increased on the election day. Finally, we evaluated counterfactual scenarios showing that ordering the lockdown 1 to 7 days sooner would have resulted in 19% to 76% fewer deaths, but that ordering it 1 to 7 days later would have resulted in 21% to 266% more deaths. Overall, the predictions of the model indicate that holding the elections on March 15 did not have a detectable impact on the total number of deaths, unless it motivated a delay in imposing the lockdown.","Duchemin, L.; Veber, P.; Boussau, B.",2020-09-08,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.09.20126862,5,Bastien Boussau,"Universite de Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, CNRS, Laboratoire de Biometrie et Biologie Evolutive UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.09.20126862v5?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.09.20126862v5.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
20913,SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy is associated with robust inflammatory response at the maternal-fetal interface,"Pregnant women appear to be at increased risk for severe outcomes associated with COVID-19, but the pathophysiology underlying this increased morbidity and its potential impact on the developing fetus is not well understood. In this study of pregnant women with and without COVID-19, we assessed viral and immune dynamics at the placenta during maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Amongst uninfected women, ACE2 was detected by immunohistochemistry in syncytiotrophoblast cells of the normal placenta during early pregnancy but was rarely seen in healthy placentas at full term. Term placentas from women infected with SARS-CoV-2, however, displayed a significant increase in ACE2 levels. Using immortalized cell lines and primary isolated placental cells, we determined the vulnerability of various placental cell types to direct infection by SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Yet, despite the susceptibility of placental cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection, viral RNA was detected in the placentas of only a subset ([~]13%) of women in this cohort. Through single cell transcriptomic analyses, we found that the maternal-fetal interface of SARS-CoV-2-infected women exhibited markers associated with pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia, and robust immune responses, including increased activation of placental NK and T cells and increased expression of interferon-related genes. Overall, this study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with immune activation at the maternal-fetal interface even in the absence of detectable local viral invasion. While this likely represents a protective mechanism shielding the placenta from infection, inflammatory changes in the placenta may also contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes and thus warrant further investigation.","Lu-Culligan, A.; Chavan, A.

Tracking cases geographically and over time is key for understanding the spread of an infectious disease and how to effectively design interventions to contain and mitigate an epidemic. In this paper we describe the reporting systems on COVID-19 in Southeast Asia during the first wave in 2020, and highlight the impact of specific reporting methods.

MethodsWe reviewed key epidemiological variables from various sources including a regionally comprehensive dataset, national trackers, dashboards, and case bulletins for 11 countries during the first wave of the epidemic in Southeast Asia. We recorded timelines of shifts in epidemiological reporting systems. We further described the differences in how epidemiological data are reported across countries and timepoints, and the accessibility of epidemiological data.

FindingsOur findings suggest that countries in Southeast Asia generally reported precise and detailed epidemiological data during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, changes in reporting were frequent and varied across data and countries. Changes in reporting rarely occurred for demographic data such as age and sex, while reporting shifts for geographic and temporal data were frequent. We also found that most countries provided COVID-19 individual-level data daily using HTML and PDF, necessitating scraping and extraction before data could be used in analyses.

InterpretationCountries have different reporting systems and different capacities for maintaining consistent reporting of epidemiological data. As the pandemic progresses, governments may also change their priorities in data sharing. Our study thus highlights the importance of more nuanced analyses of epidemiological data of COVID-19 within and across countries because of the frequent shifts in reporting. Further, most countries provide data on a daily basis but not always in a readily usable format. As governments continue to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 on health and the economy, data sharing also needs to be prioritised given its foundational role in policymaking, and the implementation and evaluation of interventions.

15425,A simplified approach to monitoring the COVID-19 epidemiologic situation using waste water analysis and its application in Russia,"The number of registered cases of COVID-19 is increasing in the world, and some countries are reporting a second wave of the pandemic. Accurate and real time information about epidemiological situation is therefore urgently needed for managing decisions in the countries, regions and municipalities which are affected. Massive testing of viral presence in human saliva, a smear from the nose, nasopharynx and / or oropharynx, bronchial lavage water obtained by fibrobronchoscopy (bronchoalveolar lavage), as well as from (endo) tracheal, nasopharyngeal aspirate, sputum, biopsy or autopsy material of the lungs, whole blood, serum or antibodies presence in blood cannot give relevant information about the COVID-19 infection rate in the community since simultaneous testing of the whole community is not technically possible, the information obtained in testing of specific groups is retarded and, in addition, such testing is expensive. The alternative to mass testing of the population is the testing of wastewater that could contain SARS-CoV-2 particles originating from excreta. Such testing has several limitations connected with the particularities of the testing procedure. In the present study, a modified approach for detection of COVID-19 infection rate using wastewater analysis has been developed. The approach includes i) the creation of a calibration curve on the basis of the serial dilution of excreta collected from people who are infected with COVID-19 and ii) the analysis of wastewater samples and their serial dilutions but the approach excludes usage of concentration techniques before wastewater sample analysis as well as usage of external control in RT-PCR reactions for calculation of numbers of viral particles. The minimum infection rate that can be detected using this approach is 0.01%. The approach developed was used to investigate wastewater from eleven sewage inspection chambers in the city of Kazan (Russia). It was demonstrated that the average infection rate of people using these sewers was over 0.4% in July 2020.","Kuryntseva, P.; Karamova, K.; Fomin, V.; Selivanovskaya, S.; Galitskaya, P.",2020-09-23,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.21.20197244,1,Polina Kuryntseva,Kazan Federal University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.21.20197244v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.21.20197244v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
20339,An open-access database of infectious disease transmission trees to explore superspreader epidemiology,"Historically, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases have caused large, deadly, and expensive multi-national outbreaks. Often outbreak investigations aim to identify who infected whom by reconstructing the outbreak transmission tree, which visualizes transmission between individuals as a network with nodes representing individuals and branches representing transmission from person to person. We compiled a database of 383 published, standardized transmission trees consisting of 16 directly-transmitted diseases ranging in size from 2 to 286 cases. For each tree and disease we calculated several key statistics, such as outbreak size, average number of secondary infections, the dispersion parameter, and the number of superspreaders. We demonstrated the potential utility of the database through short analyses addressing questions about superspreader epidemiology for a variety of diseases, including COVID-19. First, we compared the frequency and contribution of superspreaders to onward transmission across diseases. COVID-19 outbreaks had significantly fewer superspreaders than outbreaks of SARS and MERS and a dispersion parameter between that of SARS and MERS. Across diseases the presence of more superspreaders was associated with greater outbreak size. Second, we further examined how early spread impacts tree size. Generally, trees sparked by a superspreader had larger outbreak sizes than those trees not sparked by a superspreader, and this trend was significant for COVID-19 trees. Third, we investigated patterns in how superspreaders are infected. Across trees with more than one superspreader, we found support for the theory that superspreaders generate other superspreaders, even when controlling for number of secondary infections. In sum, our findings put the role of superspreading to COVID-19 transmission in perspective with that of SARS and MERS and suggest an avenue for further research on the generation of superspreaders. These data have been made openly available to encourage reuse and further scientific inquiry.

Author SummaryPublic health investigations often aim to identify who infected whom, or the transmission tree, during outbreaks of infectious diseases. These investigations tend to be resource intensive but valuable as they contain epidemiological information, including the average number of infections caused by each individual and the variation in this number. To date, there remains no standardized format nor comprehensive database of infectious disease transmission trees. To fill this gap, we standardized and compiled more than 350 published transmission trees for 16 directly-transmitted diseases into a database that is publicly available. In this paper, we give an overview of the database construction process, as well as a demonstration of the types of questions that the database can be used to answer related to superspreader epidemiology. For example, we show that COVID-19 outbreaks have fewer superspreaders than outbreaks of SARS and MERS. We also find support for the theory that superspreaders generate other superspreaders. In the future, this database can be used to answer other outstanding questions in the field of epidemiology.","Taube, J. C.; Miller, P. B.; Drake, J.

18878,"A first-in-human evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of SCB-2019, an adjuvanted, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S-protein subunit vaccine for COVID-19 in healthy adults; a phase 1, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial","BackgroundAs part of the accelerated development of prophylactic vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) we report a first-in-human dose-finding and adjuvant justification study of SCB-2019, a novel protein subunit vaccine candidate composed of a stabilised trimeric form of the spike (S)-protein produced in CHO-cells, combined with two different adjuvants.

MethodsThis phase 1 study was done in one centre in Western Australia in 151 healthy adult volunteers in two age groups (18-54 and 55-75 years), allocated to 15 groups (nine young and six older adults) to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of placebo, or 3 g, 9 g or 30 g SCB-2019, alone or adjuvanted with AS03 or CpG/Alum. Reactogenicity was assessed for 7 days after each vaccination. Humoral responses were measured as SCB-2019 binding and ACE2-competitive binding IgG antibodies by ELISA, and as neutralising antibodies by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 microneutralisation assay; cellular responses to pooled S-protein peptides were measured by flow-cytometric intracellular cytokine staining.

FindingsWe report on 148 participants with at least 4 weeks follow-up post dose 2. Three participants withdrew, two for personal reasons and one with an unrelated SAE (pituitary adenoma). Vaccination was well tolerated, with few Grade 3 solicited adverse events (AE). Most local AEs were mild injection site pain, which were more frequent with formulations containing AS03 than CpG/Alum or unadjuvanted SCB-2019. Systemic AEs, mostly transient headache, fatigue or myalgia, were more frequent in young adults than older adults after the first dose, but similar after second doses. Unadjuvanted SCB-2019 elicited minimal immune responses, but SCB-2019 with fixed doses of AS03 or CpG/Alum induced high titres and seroconversion rates of binding and neutralising antibodies in both young and older adults. Titres were higher than those observed in a panel of COVID-19 convalescent sera in all AS03 groups and high dose CpG/Alum groups. Both adjuvanted formulations elicited Th1-biased CD4+ T cell responses.

InterpretationSCB-2019 trimeric protein formulated with AS03 or CpG/Alum adjuvants elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 with high viral neutralising activity. Both adjuvanted formulations were well tolerated and are suitable for further clinical development.

16073,Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are associated with poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19,"STRUCTURED ABSTRACTO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the sole causative agent of coronavirus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19).

MethodsWe performed a retrospective single-center study of consecutively admitted patients between March 1st and May 15th, 2020, with a definitive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary end-point was to evaluate the association of lipid markers with 30-days all-cause mortality in COVID-19.

ResultsA total of 654 patients were enrolled, with an estimated 30-day mortality of 22.8% (149 patients). Non-survivors had lower total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels during the entire course of the disease with complete resolution among survivors. Both showed a significant inverse correlation with inflammatory markers and a positive correlation with lymphocyte count. In a multivariate analysis, LDL-c [&le;] 69 mg/dl (hazard ratio [HR] 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-3.31), C-reactive protein > 88 mg/dl (HR 2.44; 95% CI, 1.41-4.23) and lymphopenia < 1,000 (HR 2.68; 95% CI, 1.91-3.78) at admission were independently associated with 30-day mortality. This association was maintained 7 days after admission.

ConclusionHypolipidemia in SARS-CoV-2 infection may be secondary to an immune-inflammatory response, with complete recovery in survivors. Low LDL-c serum levels are independently associated with higher 30-day mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Aparisi, A.; Iglesias-Echeverria, C.; Ybarra-Falcon, C.; Cusacovich, I.; Uribarri, A.; Garcia-Gomez, M.; Ladron, R.; Fuertes, R.; Candela, J.; Hinojosa, W.; Duenas, C.; Gonzalez, R.; Nogales-Martin, L.; Calvo, D.; Carrasco-Moraleja, M.; San Roman, J.

14798,"Development, clinical translation, and utility of a COVID-19 antibody test with qualitative and quantitative readouts","The COVID-19 global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to place an immense burden on societies and healthcare systems. A key component of COVID-19 control efforts is serologic testing to determine the community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and quantify individual immune responses to prior infection or vaccination. Here, we describe a laboratory-developed antibody test that uses readily available research-grade reagents to detect SARS-CoV-2 exposure in patient blood samples with high sensitivity and specificity. We further show that this test affords the estimation of viral spike-specific IgG titers from a single sample measurement, thereby providing a simple and scalable method to measure the strength of an individuals immune response. The accuracy, adaptability, and cost-effectiveness of this test makes it an excellent option for clinical deployment in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Bortz, R.

7058,Environmental indicator for effective control of COVID-19 spreading,"Recently, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused viral pneumonia worldwide, spreading to more than 200 countries, posing a major threat to international health. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, in this study, we report that the city lockdown measure was an effective way to reduce the number of new cases, and the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration can be adopted as an environmental lockdown indicator. In China, after strict city lockdown, the average NO2 concentration decreased 55.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 51.5-59.6%) and the total number of newly confirmed cases decreased significantly. Our results also indicate that the global airborne NO2 concentration steeply decreased over the vast majority of COVID-19-hit areas based on satellite measurements. We found that the total number of newly confirmed cases reached an inflection point about two weeks after the lockdown. The total number of newly confirmed cases can be reduced by about 50% within 30 days of the lockdown. The stricter lockdown will help newly confirmed cases to decline earlier and more rapidly. Italy, Germany and France are good examples. Our results suggest that NO2 satellite measurement can help decision makers effectively monitor control regulations to reduce the spread of COVID-19.","Lian, X.; Huang, J.; Zhang, L.; Liu, C.; Liu, X.; Wang, L.",2020-07-27,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.05.12.20099804,2,Jianping Huang Sr.,Lanzhou University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20099804v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20099804v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
7579,Dreaming during Covid-19 pandemic: Computational assessment of dreams reveals mental suffering and fear of contagion,"Neuroscience and psychology agree that dreaming helps to cope with negative emotions and learn from experience. The current global threat related to the COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread social isolation. Does dreaming change and/or reflect mental suffering? To address these questions, we applied natural language processing tools to study 239 dream reports from 67 individuals either before the Covid-19 outbreak or during March-April, 2020, when quarantine was imposed in Brazil following the pandemic announcement by the WHO. Pandemic dreams showed a higher proportion of anger and sadness words, and higher average semantic similarities to the terms ""contamination"" and ""cleanness"". These features were associated with mental suffering related to social isolation, as they explained 39% of the variance in PANSS negative subscale (p=0.0092). These results corroborate the hypothesis that pandemic dreams reflect mental suffering, fear of contagion, and important changes in daily habits.","Mota, N.

9567,Performance and health economic evaluation of the Mount Sinai COVID-19 serological assay identifies modification of thresholding as necessary to maximise specificity of the assay,"We evaluated the FDA approved SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay (developed at Mount Sinai, by Krammer and colleagues) for the identification of COVID-19 seroconversion and potential cross-reactivity of the assay in a United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS) hospital setting. In our  set up cohort we found that the SARS-CoV-2 IgG was detectable in 100% of patients tested 14 days post positive COVID-19 nucleic acid test. Serum samples taken from pregnant women in 2018 were used as a negative control group with zero false positives. We also analysed samples from patients with non-COVID-19 viral infections, paraproteinaemia or autoantibodies and found false positive results in 6/179. Modification of the sensitivity threshold to five standard deviations from the mean of the control group eliminated all false positive result in the  set up cohort. We confirmed the validity of the test with a revised threshold on an independent prospective  validation cohort of patient samples. Taking data from both cohorts we report a sensitivity of the Mount Sinai assay of 96.6% (28/29) and specificity of 100% (299/299) using a revised threshold cut-off, at a time point at least 14 days since the diagnostic antigen test. Finally, we conducted a health economic probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) on the costs of producing the tests, and the mean cost we estimate to be 13.63 pounds sterling (95%CI 9.63 - 18.40), allowing its cost effectiveness to be tested against other antibody tests. In summary, we report that the Mount Sinai IgG ELISA assay is highly sensitive test for SARS-Cov-2 infection, however modification of thresholding was required to minimise false positive results.","Rushworth, S.

18853,Why simple face masks are unexpectedly efficient in reducing viral aerosol transmissions,"During the current pandemic and in the past, shortages of high quality respirators have forced people to protect themselves with homemade face masks that filter poorly in comparison to N95 respirators 1-4 and are often designed in ways that makes them susceptible to leaks 5,6. Nevertheless, there is compelling epidemiological 7,8 and laboratory evidence 9-12 that face masks can be effective in impeding the spread of respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Here we show that this apparent inconsistency can be resolved with a simple face mask model that combines our filtration efficiency measurements of various mask materials with existing data on exhaled aerosol characteristics. By reanalyzing these data we are able to reconcile the vastly different aerosol size distributions reported 13-19 and derive representative volume distributions for speech and breath aerosol. Multiplying filtration efficiency by those aerosol volumes, which are proportional to emitted viral load, shows that electrostatically charged materials perform the best but that even most uncharged fabrics remove > 85 % of breath and > 99 % of speech aerosol volume for exhaled particles < 10 {micro}m in diameter. A leak model we develop shows the best uncharged fabric masks are made of highly air-permeable and often thin materials reducing viral load by up to 45 % and 50 % for breath and speech, respectively. Less permeable materials provide reduced protection because unfiltered air is forced through the leak. This can even render some charged materials inferior to uncharged household materials. Our model also shows that thin fabric masks provide protection for the wearer from aerosols expelled by another person reducing inhaled viral load by up to 20 % and 50 % and if leaks are avoided up to 35 % and 90 % for breath and speech, respectively.","Freitag, S.; Howell, S.

10170,Organisms causing secondary pneumonias in COVID-19 patients at 5 UK ICUs as detected with the FilmArray test,"IntroductionSeveral viral respiratory infections - notably influenza - are associated with secondary bacterial infection and additional pathology. The extent to which this applies for COVID-19 is unknown. Accordingly, we aimed to define the bacteria causing secondary pneumonias in COVID-19 ICU patients using the FilmArray Pneumonia Panel, and to determine this tests potential in COVID-19 management.

MethodsCOVID-19 ICU patients with clinically-suspected secondary infection at 5 UK hospitals were tested with the FilmArray at point of care. We collected patient demographic data and compared FilmArray results with routine culture.

ResultsWe report results of 110 FilmArray tests on 94 patients (16 had 2 tests): 69 patients (73%) were male, the median age was 59 yrs; 92 were ventilated. Median hospital stay before testing was 14 days (range 1-38). Fifty-nine (54%) tests were positive, with 141 bacteria detected. Most were Enterobacterales (n=55, including Klebsiella spp. [n= 35]) or Staphylococcus aureus (n=13), as is typical of hospital and ventilator pneumonia. Community pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae (n=8) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=1), were rarer. FilmArray detected one additional virus (Rhinovirus/Enterovirus) and no atypical bacteria. Fewer samples (28 % vs. 54%) were positive by routine culture, and fewer species were reported per sample; Klebsiella species remained the most prevalent pathogens.

ConclusionFilmArray had a higher diagnostic yield than culture for ICU COVID-19 patients with suspected secondary pneumonias. The bacteria found mostly were Enterobacterales, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, as in typical HAP/VAP, but with Klebsiella spp. more prominent. We found almost no viral co-infection.

2350,A mathematical model for estimating the age-specific transmissibility of a novel coronavirus,"BackgroundA novel coronavirus named as ""SARS-CoV-2"" has spread widely in many countries since December 2019, especially in China. This study aimed to quantify the age-specific transmissibility by using a mathematical model.

MethodsAn age-specific susceptible - exposed - symptomatic - asymptomatic - recovered - seafood market (SEIARW) model was developed based on two suspected transmission routes (from market to person and person to person). The susceptible people from Wuhan City were divided into different age groups. We used the subscript i and j to represent age group 1 to 4 (i = j; 1: [&le;] 14 years; 2: 15-44 years; 3: 45-64 years; 4: [&ge;] 65 years) and 1 to 5 (i = j; 1: [&le;] 5 years; 2: 6-14 years; 3: 15-24 years; 4: 25-59 years; 4: [&ge;] 60 years), respectively. Data of reported COVID-19 cases were collected from one published literature from 26 November to 22 December, 2019 in Wuhan City, China. The age-specific transmissibility of the virus was estimated accordingly secondary attack rate (SAR).

ResultsThe age-specific SEIARW model fitted with the reported data well by dividing the population into four age groups ({chi}2 = 4.99 x 10-6, P > 0.999), and five age groups ({chi}2 = 4.85 x 10-6, P > 0.999). Based on the four-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 2 to 3 (SAR23 = 17.56 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 3 to 2 (SAR32 = 10.17 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 1 to 2 (SAR12 = 0.002 per 10 million persons). Based on the five-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 4 to 5 (SAR45 = 12.40 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 5 to 4 (SAR54 = 6.61 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 3 to 4 (SAR34 = 0.0002 per 10 million persons).

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 has high transmissibility among adults and elder people but low transmissibility among children and young people.","Zhao, Z.; Zhu, Y.-Z.; Xu, J.-W.; Hu, Q.-Q.; Lei, Z.; Rui, J.; Liu, X.; Wang, Y.; Luo, L.; Yu, S.-S.; Li, J.; Liu, R.-Y.; Xie, F.; Su, Y.-Y.; Chiang, Y.-C.; Su, Y.; Zhao, B.; Chen, T.",2020-03-08,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.05.20031849,1,Tianmu Chen,Xiamen University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031849v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031849v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
17933,High SARS-CoV-2 viral load is associated with a worse clinical outcome of COVID-19 disease,"COVID-19 severity and progression are determined by several host and virological factors that may influence the final outcome of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. The objective of this work is to determine a possible association between the viral load, obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs, and the severity of the infection in a cohort of 448 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients from a hospital in Madrid during the first outbreak of the pandemic in Spain. To perform this, we have clinically classified patients as mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 according to a number of clinical parameters such as hospitalization requirement, need of oxygen therapy, admission to intensive care units and/or exitus. Here we report a statistically significant correlation between viral load and disease severity, being high viral load associated with worse clinical prognosis, independently of several previously identified risk factors such as age, sex, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and lung disease (asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The data presented here reinforce the viral load as a potential biomarker for predicting disease severity in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. It is also an important parameter in viral evolution since it relates to the numbers and types of variant genomes present in a viral population, a potential determinant of disease progression.","Soria, M.

18745,Social relationships and depression during the COVID-19 lockdown: longitudinal analysis of the COVID-19 social study,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic led to social and physical distancing measures that reduced social contact and support. We explored whether people with more frequent and supportive social contact had fewer depressive symptoms during the UK Spring 2020  lockdown, whether this applied to face-to-face and remote electronic contact, and whether people with higher empathy levels, or more frequent pre-COVID social contact with others were more protected.

MethodsUK dwelling participants aged [&ge;]18 in the internet-based longitudinal COVID-19 Social Study completed up to 22 weekly questionnaires about frequency of face-to-face and phone/video social contact, perceived social support, and depressive symptoms assessed with the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9). Mixed linear models examined associations between social contact and support, and depressive symptoms. We examined for interaction by empathic concern and perspective taking and pre-COVID social contact frequency.

ResultsIn 71,117 people with mean age 49 years (standard deviation 15) we found that daily face-to-face or phone/video contact was associated with lower PHQ-9 scores (mean difference 0.258 (95% confidence interval 0.225, 0.290) and 0.117 (0.080, 0.154) respectively) compared to having no contact. Those with high social support scored 1.836 (1.801, 1.871) PHQ-9 points lower than those with low support. The odds ratio for depression for those with daily face-to-face social contact compared to no face-to-face contact was 0.712 (0.678, 0.747). Daily compared to no phone/video contact was associated with odds ratio for depression 0.825 (0.779, 0.873). And reporting high, compared to low, social support was associated with 0.145 (95%CI 0.138, 0.152) odds ratio for depression. The negative association between social relationships and depressive symptoms was stronger for those with high empathic concern, perspective taking and usual sociability.

ConclusionsThose who had more face-to-face contact during lockdown had fewer depressive symptoms. Phone or video communication were beneficial but less so. People who were usually more sociable or had higher empathy were more likely to have depressive symptoms during enforced reduced social contact. Results have implications both for our management of COVID-19 and potential future pandemics, and for our understanding of the relationship between social factors and mental health.","Sommerlad, A.; Marston, L.; Huntley, J.; Livingston, G.; Lewis, G.; Steptoe, A.; Fancourt, D.",2020-12-03,Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology,10.1101/2020.12.01.20241950,1,Andrew Sommerlad,University College London,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.01.20241950v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.01.20241950v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1017/S0033291721000039
19937,Insights into the molecular mechanism of anticancer drug ruxolitinib repurposable in COVID-19 therapy,"Due to non-availability of specific therapeutics against COVID-19, repurposing of approved drugs is a reasonable option. Cytokines imbalance in COVID-19 resembles cancer; exploration of anti-inflammatory agents, might reduce COVID-19 mortality. The current study investigates the effect of ruxolitinib treatment in SARS-CoV-2 infected alveolar cells compared to the uninfected one from the GSE5147507 dataset. The protein-protein interaction network, biological process and functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes were studied using STRING App of the Cytoscape software and R programming tools. The present study indicated that ruxolitinib treatment elicited similar response equivalent to that of SARS-CoV-2 uninfected situation by inducing defense response in host against virus infection by RLR and NOD like receptor pathways. Further, the effect of ruxolitinib in SARS-CoV-2 infection was mainly caused by significant suppression of IFIH1, IRF7 and MX1 genes as well as inhibition of DDX58/IFIH1-mediated induction of interferon-I and -II signalling.","Mandal, M.; Mandal, S.",2021-01-04,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.12.29.20248986,1,Shyamapada Mandal,"University of Gour Banga, India",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.29.20248986v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.29.20248986v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

3396,A phased lift of control: a practical strategy to achieve herd immunity against Covid-19 at the country level,"Most countries are affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and experience rapidly increasing numbers of cases and deaths. Many have implemented nationwide stringent control to avoid overburdening the health care system. This paralyzes economic and social activities until the availability of a vaccine, which may take years. We propose an alternative exit strategy to develop herd immunity in a predictable and controllable way: a phased lift of control. This means that successive parts of the country (e.g. provinces) stop stringent control, and Covid-19-related IC admissions are distributed over the country as the whole. Importantly, vulnerable individuals need to be shielded until herd immunity has developed in their area. We explore the characteristics and duration of this strategy using a novel individual-based model for geographically stratified transmission of Covid-19 in a country. The model predicts that individuals will have to experience stringent control for about 14 months on average, but this duration may be significantly shortened by future developments (more IC beds, better drugs). Clearly, the strategy will have a profound impact on individuals and society, and should therefore be considered carefully by various other disciplines (e.g. health systems, ethics, economics) before actual implementation.","De Vlas, S.

11241,A minimal model for household effects in epidemics,"Shelter-in-place and other confinement strategies implemented in the current COVID-19 pandemic have created stratified patterns of contacts between people: close contacts within households and more distant contacts between the households. The epidemic transmission dynamics is significantly modified as a consequence.

We introduce a minimal model that incorporates these household effects in the framework of mean-field theory and numerical simulations. We show that the reproduction number R0 depends on the household size in a surprising way: linearly for relatively small households, and as a square root of size for larger households. We discuss the implications of the findings for the lockdown, test, tracing, and isolation policies.","Huber, G.; Kamb, M.; Kawagoe, K.; Li, L.; Veytsman, B.; Yllanes, D.; Zigmond, D.",2020-07-11,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.09.20150227,1,Boris Veytsman,Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20150227v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20150227v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1088/1478-3975/abb209
9534,Rotational Thromboelastometry predicts care level in Covid-19,"BackgroundHigh prevalence of thrombotic events in severely ill COVID-19 patients have been reported. Pulmonary embolism as well as microembolization of vital organs may in these individuals be direct causes of death. The identification of patients at high risk of developing thrombosis may lead to targeted, more effective prophylactic treatment.

ObjectivesTo test whether Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) indicates hypercoagulopathy in COVID-19 patients, and whether patients with severe disease have a more pronounced hypercoagulopathy compared with less severely ill patients.

MethodsThe study was designed as a prospective observational study where COVID-19 patients over 18 years admitted to hospital were eligible for inclusion. Patients were divided into two groups depending on care level: 1) regular wards or 2) wards with specialized ventilation support. ROTEM was taken after admission and the data were compared with ROTEM in healthy controls.

ResultsThe ROTEM variables Maximum Clot Firmness (EXTEM-/FIBTEM-MCF) were higher in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls (p<0.001) and higher in severely ill patients compared with patients at regular wards (p<0.05). Coagulation Time (EXTEM-CT) was longer and Clot Formation Time (EXTEM-CFT) shorter in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. Our results suggest that hypercoagulopathy is present in hospitalized patients with mild to severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

ConclusionROTEM variables were significantly different in COVID-19 patients early after admission compared with healthy controls. This pattern was more pronounced in patients with increased disease severity, suggesting that ROTEM-analysis may be useful to predict thromboembolic complications in these patients.","Almskog, L.; Wikman, A.; Svensson, J.; Wanecek, M.; Bottai, M.; Van Der Linden, J.; Agren, A.",2020-06-23,Intensive Care And Critical Care Medicine,10.1101/2020.06.11.20128710,2,Lou Almskog,"Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.11.20128710v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.11.20128710v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1007/s11239-020-02312-3
16104,Psychiatric morbidity and protracted symptoms in recovered COVID-19 patients,"We investigated the psychiatric symptomatology and the protracted symptoms in recently recovered COVID-19 patients. This cross-sectional study assessed 284 patients recruited from a tertiary hospital. Patients completed a web-based survey on socio-demographic data, past medical/psychiatric history, and additional information relevant to the outbreak conditions. The psychiatric status was assessed using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and MINI suicidality scale. Patients completed a checklist for the acute symptom burden and protracted symptoms that were experienced after the acute infection. After a mean of 50 days following the diagnosis of COVID-19, 98 patients (34.5%) reported clinically significant PTSD, anxiety, and/or depression, with PTSD being the most common condition reported (25.4%). One hundred and eighteen patients (44.3%) reported one or more protracted symptom(s), with fatigue, muscle aches, alteration of smell/taste, headache and difficulty in concentration, being the most common symptoms reported. Predictors of PTSD symptom severity were the female gender, past traumatic events, protracted symptoms, perceived stigmatization, and a negative view on the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that PTSD symptom severity was the sole independent predictor of the presence of protracted symptoms. Our results suggest that COVID-19 patients may be prone to substantial psychological distress in the first months after the infection. The protracted symptoms were also frequent in this period, and these were related to the posttraumatic psychiatric morbidity. Both the psychiatric morbidity and the protracted symptoms were independent of the initial infection severity. Further research on the neurobiological commonalities between the protracted symptoms and PTSD in COVID-19 patients is warranted.","Poyraz, B.

20132,Evaluation of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in utero: nine pregnant women and their newborns,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), mainly transmitted by droplets and close contact, has caused a pandemic worldwide as of November 2020. According to the current case reports and cohort studies, the symptoms of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to normal adults and may cause a series of adverse consequences of pregnancy (placental abruption, fetal distress, epilepsy during pregnancy, etc.). However, whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to the fetus through the placental barrier is still a focus of debate.

MethodsIn this study, in order to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 infect fetus through placental barrier, we performed qualitative detection of virus structural protein (spike protein and nucleoprotein) and targeted receptor protein (ACE2, CD147 and GRP78) expression on the placental tissue of seven pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 through immunohistochemistry. Amniotic fluid, neonatal throat, anal swab and breastmilk samples were collected immediately in the operating room for verification after delivery, which were all tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

ResultsThe result showed that CD147 was expressed on the basal side of the chorionic trophoblast cell membrane and ACE2 was expressed on the maternal side, while GRP78 was strongly expressed in the cell membrane and cytoplasm. The RT-PCR results of Amniotic fluid, neonatal throat, anal swab and breastmilk samples were all negative.

ConclusionsWe believed that despite the detection of viral structural proteins in the placenta, SARS-CoV-2 cannot be transmitted to infants due to the presence of the placental barrier.

SummaryOur results showed that, excluding environmental pollution after birth and vaginal infection during childbirth, SARS-CoV-2 was less likely to be transmitted vertically in utero.","Dong, L.; Pei, S.; Ren, Q.; Fu, S.; Yu, L.; Chen, H.; Chen, X.; Yin, M.",2021-01-08,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.12.28.20248874,1,Mingzhu Yin,"Department of Dermatology & Hunan Engineering Research Center of Skin Health and Disease, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.28.20248874v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.28.20248874v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of RDV in patients with COVID-19 in real world settings.

MethodsPatients were selected from 1496 individuals included in the SARSTer national database; 122 of them received therapy with RDV and 211 were treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based therapy. The primary end-point of effectiveness was clinical improvement in the ordinal 8-point scale, which was defined as a 2-point decrease from baseline to 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of hospitalization. The secondary end-points of effectiveness included: death rate, rate of no clinical improvement within 28 days of hospitalization in the ordinal scale, rate of the need for constant oxygen therapy, duration of oxygen therapy, rate of the need for mechanical ventilation, total hospitalization time, and rate of positive RT PCR for SARS-CoV-2 after 30 days.

FindingsSignificantly higher rates of clinical improvement, by 15% and 10% respectively, were observed after RDV treatment compared to LPV/r at days 21 and 28. The difference between regimens increased with worsening of oxygen saturation (SpO2) and depending on the baseline score from the ordinal scale. Statistically significant differences supporting RDV were also noted regarding the rate of no clinical improvement within 28 days of hospitalization and hospitalization duration in patients with baseline SpO2 [&le;]90%.

Surveillance systems form the foundation stone of active case finding, testing and contact tracing, which are the key components of the public health response to this novel, emerging infectious disease . There is uncertainty about the true proportion of patients who remain asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic at a given time. As per the WHO-China Joint Monitoring Mission Report, and an analysis of 21 published reports, anywhere between 5 and 80 per cent of SARS CoV 2 infected patients have been noted to be asymptomatic. Whereas in India 4197563 cases are positive, in which in West Bengal total 180788 cases (4.04% of Cases of India) positive of COVID 19. In Paschim Medinipur (West Medinipur) district contributing total 5489 cases (3.03% cases of West Bengal). In this scenario, we want to know the status of IgG seroprevalence of SARS CoV 2 among asymptomatic general population, so that we can determine the extent of infection of SARS CoV 2 in general population. Objectives: Primary Objective: To estimate the seroprevalence for SARS CoV 2 infection in the general asymptomatic population at Paschim Medinipur District. Secondary Objectives: To estimate age and sex specific seroprevalence. To determine the socio demographic risk factors for SARS CoV 2 infection; To determine the other risk factors like comorbidities, vaccination status, travel history, contact history etc.; To determine the durability of Immunity (IgG) conferred by natural infection of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals previously RTPCR positive. Methodology: It was a cross sectional 30 cluster study among the population of Paschim Medinipur district of West Bengal conducted in last week of July and 1st week of August 2020 among 458 asymptomatic general population and 30 RTPCR positive cases in 30 villages or wards of municipalities. 30 clusters were chosen from list of COVID 19 affected villages/wards of municipality as per PPS (Probability Proportional to Size) method. Results: Of the 458 asymptomatic general population,19 asymptomatic people found to be seropositive IgG for SARS CoV 2 with Mean or average total seropositivity rate of 4.15%. 19 Out of 30 (63.33%) RTPCR positive patients found Seronegative.

Among risk factors, the risk of having IgG is more in persons having Travel history with odds ratio of 2.99- 95%CI (1.17-7.65) with p-value- 0.02. Hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis with Odds ratio of 8.49- 95% CI(1.59-45.19) with p value - 0.003. Occupation as migrant labour with Odds ratio of 5.08- 95% CI(1.96-13.18) with p value of 0.001. H/O Chicken pox with Odds ratio of 2.15- 95% CI(0.59-7.79) with p value of 0.017. Influenza vaccinated with Odds ratio of 8.07 with 95% CI (0.8-81.48) with a p value of 0.036. Conclusion: Of the 458 asymptomatic general population,19 asymptomatic people found to be seropositive IgG for SARS-CoV-2 with Mean or average total seropositivity rate of 4.15%. 19 Out of 30 (63.33%) RTPCR positive patients found Seronegative. Median of Days between RTPCR test and sero negativity found was 60 with minimum 28 days to maximum 101 days and Range of 73 days and a standard deviation of 19.46. Those having Travel History and having occupation as Migrant Labourer have significantly higher probability of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2. No role has been found of Hydroxychloroquine Medicines as Chemoprophylactic. No durable immunity conferred by natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 mean time to become seronegative after positive RTPCR test 60 days. So there is a chance of reinfection after average 2 months.","Satpati, P.; Sarangi, S. S.; Gantait, K.; Endow, S.; Mandal, N.

11769,Probabilistic approaches for classifying highly variable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses,"Serological studies are critical for understanding pathogen-specific immune responses and informing public health measures1,2. By developing highly sensitive and specific trimeric spike (S)-based antibody tests, we report IgM, IgG and IgA responses to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients (n=105) representing different categories of disease severity. All patients surveyed were IgG positive against S. Elevated anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were associated with hospitalization, with IgA titers, increased circulating IL-6 and strong neutralizing responses indicative of intensive care status. Antibody-positive blood donors and pregnant women sampled during the pandemic in Stockholm, Sweden (weeks 14-25), displayed on average lower titers and weaker neutralizing responses compared to patients; however, inter-individual anti-viral IgG titers differed up to 1,000-fold. To provide more accurate estimates of seroprevalence, given the frequency of weak responders and the limitations associated with the dichotomization of a continuous variable3,4, we used a Bayesian approach to assign likelihood of past infection without setting an assay cut-off. Analysis of blood donors (n=1,000) and pregnant women (n=900) sampled weekly demonstrated SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG in 7.2% (95% Bayesian CI [5.1 - 9.5]) of individuals two months after the peak of spring 2020 COVID-19 deaths. Seroprevalence in these otherwise healthy cohorts increased steeply before beginning to level-off, following the same trajectory as the Stockholm region deaths over this time period.","Castro Dopico, X.; Hanke, L.; Sheward, D.

9531,Differential impacts of contact tracing and lockdowns on outbreak size in COVID-19 model applied to China,"Rapid growth of the COVID-19 epidemic in China induced extensive efforts of contact tracing and social-distancing/lockdowns, which quickly contained the outbreak and has been replicated to varying degrees around the world. We construct a novel infectious disease model incorporating these distinct quarantine measures (contact tracing and self-quarantine) as reactionary interventions dependent on current infection levels. Derivation of the final outbreak size leads to a simple inverse proportionality relationship with self-quarantine rate, revealing a fundamental principle of exponentially increasing cumulative cases when delaying mass quarantine or lockdown measures beyond a critical time period. In contrast, contact tracing results in a proportional reduction in reproduction number, flattening the epidemic curve but only having sizable impact on final size when a large proportion of contacts are ""perfectly"" traced. We fit the mathematical model to data from China on reported cases and quarantined contacts, finding that lockdowns had an overwhelming influence on outbreak size and duration, whereas contact tracing played a role in reducing peak number of infected. Sensitivity analysis and simulations under different re-opening scenarios illustrate the differential effects that responsive contact tracing and lockdowns can have on current and second wave outbreaks.","Browne, C.; Gulbudak, H.; Macdonald, J.

15263,"COVID-19: Risks of Re-emergence, Re-infection, and Control Measures -- A Long Term Modelling Study","In this work we define a modified SEIR model that accounts for the spread of infection during the latent period, infections from asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic infected individuals, potential loss of acquired immunity, people's increasing awareness of social distancing and the use of vaccination as well as non-pharmaceutical interventions like social confinement. We estimate model parameters in three different scenarios - in Italy, where there is a growing number of cases and re-emergence of the epidemic, in India, where there are significant number of cases post confinement period and in Victoria, Australia where a re-emergence has been controlled with severe social confinement program. Our result shows the benefit of long-term confinement of 50% or above population and extensive testing. With respect to loss of acquired immunity, our model suggests higher impact for Italy. We also show that a reasonably effective vaccine with mass vaccination program can be successful in significantly controlling the size of infected population. We show that for India, a reduction in contact rate by 50% compared to a reduction of 10% in the current stage can reduce death from 0.0268% to 0.0141% of population. Similarly, for Italy we show that reducing contact rate by half can reduce a potential peak infection of 15% population to less than 1.5% of population, and potential deaths from 0.48% to 0.04%. With respect to vaccination, we show that even a 75% efficient vaccine administered to 50% population can reduce the peak number of infected populations by nearly 50% in Italy. Similarly, for India, a 0.056% of population would die without vaccination, while 93.75% efficient vaccine given to 30% population would bring this down to 0.036% of population, and 93.75% efficient vaccine given to 70% population would bring this down to 0.034%.","Ghosh, S.

17163,"The COVID-19 Healthcare Personnel Study (CHPS): Overview, Methods and Preliminary Report","IntroductionThe COVID-19 Healthcare Personnel Study (CHPS) was designed to assess and mitigate adverse short and long-term physical and mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on New Yorks health care workforce. Here we report selected baseline results.

MethodsOnline survey of New York State physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants registered with the New York State Department of Health. Survey-weighted descriptive results were analyzed using frequencies, proportions, and means, with 95% confidence intervals. Odds ratios were calculated for association using survey-weighted logistic regression.

ResultsApproximately 51.5% (95% CI 49.1, 54.0) of the survey-weighted respondents reported having worked directly or in close physical contact with COVID-19 patients. Of those tested for COVID-19, 27.3% (95% CI 22.5, 32.2) were positive. Having symptoms consistent with COVID-19 was associated with reporting a subsequent positive COVID-19 test (OR=14.0, 95% CI 5.7, 34.7). Over half of the respondents, (57.6%) reported a negative impact of the COVID-19 efforts on their mental health. Respondents who indicated that they were redeployed or required to do different functions than usual in response to COVID-19 were more likely to report negative mental health impacts (OR=1.3, 95% CI 1.1, 1.6).

ConclusionsAt the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York State in Spring 2020, more than half of physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants included in this study responded to the crisis, often at a cost to their physical and mental health and disruption to their lives.","The Covid-19 Healthcare Personnel Study (Chps),  ; Dimaggio, C.; Abramson, D.; Susser, E.; Hoven, C.; Chen, Q.; Andrews, H.; Herman, D.; Kreniske, J.; Ryan, M.; Susser, I.; Thorpe, L.; Li, G.",2020-10-30,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.10.29.20222372,1,Charles Dimaggio,"NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Department of Surgery",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.29.20222372v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.29.20222372v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
7052,The impact of containment measures and air temperature on mitigating COVID-19 transmission: non-classical SEIR modeling and analysis,"Early non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are crucial to prevent and control of COVID-19 pandemic. We established a stochastic non-classical SEIR NPIs model (ScEIQRsh) which can quantify the three kinds of NPIs measures simultaneously to mimic the clustered intra-family or intra-acquaintance spreading pattern of COVID-19 under the effective integrated NPIs in Mainland China. Model simulation demonstrated that measures to diminish contactable susceptible (Sc), such as home confinement, travel constraint, social distancing etc. and measures to avoid delay of diagnosis and hospitalized isolation ({eta}) were more effective but consumptive than contact tracing ({kappa}, {rho}). From fitted model by MCMC method, the proportion of asymptomatic infectors was 14.88% (IQR 8.17%, 25.37%). The association between air temperature and the fitted transmission rate ({beta}) of COVID-19 suggests that COVID-19 pandemic would be seasonal with the optimal temperature range of 5{degrees}C-14{degrees}C and peak of 10{degrees}C for spreading, and vaccine is indispensable to ultimate prevention COVID-19.","Liu, D.; Tai, Q.; Wang, Y.; Pu, M.; Ge, S.; Ji, T.; Zhang, L.; Su, B.",2020-05-24,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.05.12.20099267,2,Bo Su,"Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20099267v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20099267v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

14363,Exploring options for reprocessing of N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators (N95-FFRs) amidst COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review,"BackgroundThere is global shortage of Personal Protective Equipment due to COVID-19 pandemic. N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators (N95-FFRs) provide respiratory protection against respiratory pathogens including SARS-COV-2. There is scant literature on reprocessing methods which can enable reuse of N95-FFRs.

AimWe conducted this study to evaluate research done, prior to COVID-19 pandemic, on various decontamination methods for reprocessing of N95-FFRs.

MethodsWe searched 5 electronic databases (Pubmed, Google Scholar, Crossref, Ovid, ScienceDirect) and 1 Grey literature database (OpenGrey). We included original studies, published prior to year 2020, which had evaluated any decontamination method on FFRs. Studies had evaluated a reprocessing method against parameters namely physical changes, user acceptability, respirator fit, filter efficiency, microbicidal efficacy and presence of chemical residues post-reprocessing.

Findings and ConclusionsOverall, we found 7887 records amongst which 17 original research articles were finally included for qualitative analysis. Overall, 21 different types of decontamination or reprocessing methods for N95-FFRs were evaluated. Most commonly evaluated method for reprocessing of FFRs was Ultraviolet (Type-C) irradiation (UVGI) which was evaluated in 13/17 (76%) studies.

We found published literature is scant on this topic despite warning signs of pandemic of a respiratory illness over the years. Promising technologies requiring expeditious evaluation are UVGI, Microwave generated steam (MGS) and Hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV). Global presence of technologies, which have been given Emergency use authorisation for N95-FFR reprocessing, is extremely limited. Reprocessing of N95-FFRs by MGS should be considered for emergency implementation in resource limited settings to tackle shortage of N95-FFRs.

6484,Forecasting the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria using Box-Jenkins Modeling Procedure,"ObjectiveThis study is focused on the analysis of the spread of Covid-19 in Nigeria, applying statistical models and available data from the NCDC. We present an insight into the spread of Covid-19 in Nigeria in order to establish a suitable prediction model, which can be applied as a decision-supportive tool for assigning health interventions and mitigating the spread of the Covid-19 infection.

MethodologyDaily spread data from February 27 to April 26, 2020, were collected to construct the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model using the R software. Stability analysis and stationarity test, parameter test, and model diagnostic were also carried out. Finally, the fitting, selection and prediction accuracy of the ARIMA model was evaluated using the AICc model selection criteria.

ResultsThe ARIMA (1,1,0) model was finally selected among ARIMA models based upon the parameter test and Box-Ljung test. A ten-day forecast was also made from the model, which shows a steep upward trend of the spread of the COVID-19 in Nigeria within the selected time frame.

ConclusionFederal Government of Nigeria through the presidential task force can apply the forecasted trend of much more spread to make more informed decisions on the additional measures in place to curb the spread of the virus. Application of the model can also assist in studying the effectiveness of the lockdown on the on the spread of Covid-19 in Nigeria.","Ibrahim, R. R.; Oladipo, O.

To start to define these risks, in a systematic manner, we investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the abdominal fluid and lower genital tract of patients undergoing surgery.

MethodsWe carried out a prospective cross sectional observational study of 113 patients undergoing abdominal surgery or instrumentation of the lower genital tract. We took COVID swabs from the peritoneal cavity and from the vagina from all eligible patients. Results were stratified by pre operative COVID status.

ResultsIn patients who were presumed COVID negative at the time of surgery SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA was detected in 0/102 peritoneal samples and 0/98 vaginal samples. Peritoneal and vaginal swabs were also negative in one patient who had a positive nasopharyngeal swab immediately prior to surgery.

ConclusionsThe presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the abdominal fluid or lower genital tract of presumed negative patients is nil or extremely low. These data will inform surgeons of the risks of restarting laparoscopic surgery at a time when COVID19 is endemic in the population.","Jones, D.; Faluyi, D.; Hamilton, S.; Stylianides, N.; Ma, K.; Duff, S.; Machin, N.; Edmondson, R.",2020-08-02,Surgery,10.1101/2020.07.30.20165043,2,Richard Edmondson,University of Manchester,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.20165043v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.20165043v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

Past research has highlighted the corrosive effects of unemployment on health and health behaviors. This study examines whether the effects of job loss on changes in body mass index (BMI) are moderated by genetic predisposition using data from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS). To improve detection of gene-by-environment (G x E) interplay, we interacted layoffs from business closures--a plausibly exogenous environmental exposure--with whole-genome polygenic scores (PGSs) that capture genetic contributions to both the population mean (mPGS) and variance (vPGS) of BMI. Results show evidence of genetic moderation using a vPGS (as opposed to an mPGS) and indicate genome-wide summary measures of phenotypic plasticity may further our understanding of how environmental stimuli modify the distribution of complex traits in a population.","Schmitz, L.

2971,"COVID-19 infection induces readily detectable morphological and inflammation-related phenotypic changes in peripheral blood monocytes, the severity of which correlate with patient outcome","BackgroundExcessive monocyte/macrophage activation with the development of a cytokine storm and subsequent acute lung injury, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a feared consequence of infection with COVID-19. The ability to recognize and potentially intervene early in those patients at greatest risk of developing this complication could be of great clinical utility.

MethodsWe performed detailed flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood samples from 28 COVID-19 patients treated at Xian No.8 Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University in early 2020 in an attempt to identify factors that could help predict severity of disease and patient outcome.

FindingsWhile we did not detect significant differences in the number of monocytes between patients with COVID-19 and normal healthy individuals,we did identify significant morphological and functional differences, which are more pronounced in patients requiring prolonged hospitalization and ICU admission. Patients with COVID-19 have larger than normal monocytes, easily identified on forward scatter, side scatter analysis by routine flow cytometry,with the presence of a distinct population of monocytes with high forward scatter (FSC-high). On more detailed analysis, these FSC-high monocytes are CD11b+, CD14+, CD16+, CD68+, CD80+, CD163+, CD206+ and secrete IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha, consistent with an inflammatory phenotype.

ConclusionsThe detection and serial monitoring of this subset of inflammatory monocytes using flow cytometry could be of great help in guiding the prognostication and treatment of patients with COVID-19 and merits further evaluation.","Zhang, D.; Guo, R.; Lei, L.; Liu, H.; Wang, Y.; Wang, Y.; Dai, T.; Zhang, T.; Lai, Y.; Wang, J.; Liu, Z.; He, A.; O'dwyer, M.; Hu, J.",2020-03-26,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.24.20042655,1,Jinsong Hu,Xi\'an Jiaotong University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042655v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042655v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
7788,Determinants of COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance in the U.S.,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the U.S., which leads globally in total cases and deaths. As COVID-19 vaccines are under development, public health officials and policymakers need to create strategic vaccine-acceptance messaging to effectively control the pandemic and prevent thousands of additional deaths.

MethodsUsing an online platform, we surveyed the U.S. adult population in May 2020 to understand risk perceptions about the COVID-19 pandemic, acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine, and trust in sources of information. These factors were compared across basic demographics.

FindingsOf the 672 participants surveyed, 450 (67%) said they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine if it is recommended for them. Males (72%), older adults ([&ge;]55 years; 78%), Asians (81%), and college and/or graduate degree holders (75%) were more likely to accept the vaccine. When comparing reported influenza vaccine uptake to reported acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine: 1) participants who did not complete high school had a very low influenza vaccine uptake (10%), while 60% of the same group said they would accept the COVID-19 vaccine; 2) unemployed participants reported lower influenza uptake and lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance when compared to those employed or retired; and, 3) black Americans reported lower influenza vaccine uptake and lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance than nearly all other racial groups. Lastly, we identified geographic differences with Department of Health and Human Services regions 2 (New York) and 5 (Chicago) reporting less than 50 percent COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.

InterpretationAlthough our study found a 67% acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine, there were noticeable demographic and geographical disparities in vaccine acceptance. Before a COVID-19 vaccine is introduced to the U.S., public health officials and policymakers must prioritize effective COVID-19 vaccine-acceptance messaging for all Americans, especially those who are most vulnerable.

14985,Strict lockdown versus flexible social distance strategy for COVID-19 disease: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"Objectives To balance the costs and effects comparing a strict lockdown versus a flexible social distancing strategy for societies affected by Coronavirus-19 Disease (COVID-19). Design Cost-effectiveness analysis. Participants We used societal data and COVID-19 mortality rates from the public domain. Interventions The intervention was a strict lockdown strategy that has been followed by Denmark. Reference strategy was flexible social distancing policy as was applied by Sweden. We derived mortality rates from COVID-19 national statistics, assumed the expected life years lost from each COVID-19 death to be 11 years and calculated lost life years until 31st August 2020. Expected economic costs were derived from gross domestic productivity (GDP) statistics from each country's official statistics bureau and forecasted GDP. The incremental financial costs of the strict lockdown were calculated by comparing Sweden with Denmark using externally available market information. Calculations were projected per one million inhabitants. In sensitivity analyses we varied the total cost of the lockdown (range -50% to +100%). Main outcome measure Financial costs per life years saved. Results In Sweden, the number of people who died with COVID-19 was 577 per million inhabitants, resulting in an estimated 6,350 life years lost per million inhabitants. In Denmark, where a strict lockdown strategy was installed for months, the number of people dying with COVID-19 was on average 111 per million, resulting in an estimated 1,216 life years per million inhabitants lost. The incremental costs of strict lockdown to save one life year was US$ 137,285, and higher in most of the sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Comparisons of public health interventions for COVID-19 should take into account life years saved and not only lost lives. Strict lockdown costs more than US$ 130,000 per life year saved. As our all our assumptions were in favour of strict lockdown, a flexible social distancing policy in response to COVID19 is defendable.","Mol, B.

Elements which were most frequently and consistently recorded across studies are presented in relation to their relative commonality.

ResultsAcross the 25 studies, 261 data elements were recorded in total. The most frequently recorded 100 data elements were identified across all studies and are presented with relative frequencies. Categories with the largest numbers of common elements included demographics, admission criteria, medical history and investigations. Mortality and need for specific respiratory support were the most common outcome measures, but with specific studies including a range of other outcome measures.

ConclusionThe findings of this study have demonstrated that it is feasible to collate specific data elements recorded across a range of studies investigating a specific clinical condition in order to identify those elements which are most common among studies. These data may be of value for those establishing new studies and to allow researchers to rapidly identify studies collecting data of potential use hence minimising duplication and increasing data re-use and interoperability","Mathewson, P.; Gordon, B.; Snowley, K.; Fennessy, C.; Denniston, A.; Sebire, N.",2020-05-26,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.05.19.20106641,1,Neil Sebire,Great Ormond Street Hospital and ICH London,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20106641v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20106641v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
7527,Who should we test for COVID-19? A triage model built from national symptom surveys,"The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is detection of viral RNA in a reverse transcription PCR test. Due to global limitations in testing capacity, effective prioritization of individuals for testing is essential. Here, we devised a model that estimates the probability of an individual to test positive for COVID-19 based on answers to 9 simple questions regarding age, gender, presence of prior medical conditions, general feeling, and the symptoms fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat and loss of taste or smell, all of which have been associated with COVID-19 infection. Our model was devised from a subsample of a national symptom survey that was answered over 2 million times in Israel over the past 2 months and a targeted survey distributed to all residents of several cities in Israel. Overall, 43,752 adults were included, from which 498 self-reported as being COVID-19 positive. We successfully validated the model on held-out individuals from Israel where it achieved a positive predictive value (PPV) of 46.3% at a 10% sensitivity and demonstrated its applicability outside of Israel by further validating it on an independently collected symptom survey dataset from the U.K., U.S. and Sweden, where it achieved a PPV of 34.7% at 10% sensitivity. Moreover, evaluating the models performance on this latter independent dataset on entries collected one week prior to the PCR test and up to the day of the test we found the highest performance on the day of the test. As our tool can be used online and without the need of exposure to suspected patients, it may have worldwide utility in combating COVID-19 by better directing the limited testing resources through prioritization of individuals for testing, thereby increasing the rate at which positive individuals can be identified and isolated.","Shoer, S.; Karady, T.; Keshet, A.; Shilo, S.; Rossman, H.; Gavrieli, A.; Meir, T.; Lavon, A.; Kolobkov, D.; Kalka, I.; Godneva, A.; Cohen, O.; Kariv, A.; Hoch, O.; Zer-Aviv, M.; Castel, N.; Sudre, C.; Ekka Zohar, A.; Irony, A.; Spector, T.; Geiger, B.; Hizi, D.; Shalev, V.; Balicer, R.; Segal, E.",2020-06-08,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.18.20105569,2,Eran Segal,Weizmann Institute of Science,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.18.20105569v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.18.20105569v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.medj.2020.10.002
18114,Assessing the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the dynamics of COVID-19: A mathematical modelling study in the case of Ethiopia,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020 and by November 14, 2020 there were 53.3M confirmed cases and 1.3M reported deaths in the world. In the same period, Ethiopia reported 102K cases and 1.5K deaths. Effective public health preparedness and response to COVID-19 requires timely projections of the time and size of the peak of the outbreak. Currently, in the absence of vaccine or effective treatment, the implementation of NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions), like hand washing, wearing face coverings or social distancing, is recommended by WHO to bring the pandemic under control. This study proposes a modified Susceptible Exposed Infected and Recovered (SEIR) model to predict the number of COVID-19 cases at different stages of the disease under the implementation of NPIs with different adherence levels in both urban and rural settings of Ethiopia. To estimate the number of cases and their peak time, 30 different scenarios were simulated. The results reveal that the peak time of the pandemic is different in urban and rural populations of Ethiopia. In the urban population, under moderate implementation of three NPIs the pandemic will be expected to reach its peak in December, 2020 with 147,972 cases, of which 18,100 are symptomatic and 957 will require admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Among the implemented NPIs, increasing the coverage of wearing masks by 10% could reduce the number of new cases on average by one-fifth in urban-populations. Varying the coverage of wearing masks in rural populations minimally reduces the number of cases. In conclusion, the projection result reveals that the projected number of hospital cases is higher than the Ethiopian health system capacity during the peak time. To contain symptomatic and ICU cases within health system capacity, the government should give attention to the strict implementation of the existing NPIs or impose additional public health measures.","Ejigu, B.

16064,Personal protective equipment for reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers involved in emergency trauma surgery during the pandemic: a systematic review protocol,"ObjectiveThe objective of this broad evidence synthesis is to identify and summarize the available literature regarding the efficacy of different personal protective equipment (PPE) for reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection in health personnel caring for patients undergoing trauma surgery in low-resource environments (LREs).

IntroductionMany healthcare facilities in low-and middle-income countries are inadequately resourced and may lack optimal organization and governance, especially concerning surgical health systems. COVID-19 has the potential to decimate these already strained surgical healthcare services unless health systems take stringent measures to protect healthcare workers from viral exposure and ensure the continuity of specialized care for the patients.

Inclusion criteriaThis review will preferentially consider systematic reviews of experimental and quasi-experimental studies, as well as individual studies of such designs, evaluating the effect of different PPE on the risk of COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) involved in emergency trauma surgery.

MethodsWe will conduct several searches in the L{middle dot}OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs automated regular searches in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and over thirty other sources. The search results will be presented according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram. Critical appraisal of the eligible studies for methodological quality will be conducted. Data will be extracted using the standardized data extraction tool in Covidence. Studies will, when possible, be pooled in a statistical meta-analysis using JBI SUMARI. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for grading the certainty of evidence will be followed, and a Summary of Findings (SoF) will be created.

8460,A serological assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in at-home collected finger-prick dried blood spots,"Accurate surveillance of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence requires large-scale testing of the population. Current testing methods require in-person collection of biospecimens by a healthcare worker, limiting access of individuals who do not have access to testing facilities while placing both patients and healthcare workers at risk of exposure to infection. We report the development and validation of a at-home finger-prick dried blood spot collection kit and an analysis method. We demonstrated 100% sensitivity and specificity using at-home collected specimens across the US. Such methods may facilitate the conduct of unbiased serosurveys within hard to reach populations and help reduce the sample collection burden of serological testing on both health care systems and individuals alike.","Karp, D.

9503,Effect of social distancing on COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the US,"Social distancing policies were implemented in most US states as a containment strategy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The effectiveness of these policy interventions on morbidity and mortality remains unknown. Our analysis examined the associations between statewide policies and objective measures of social distancing, and objective social distancing and COVID-19 incidence and mortality. We used nationwide, de-identified smartphone GPS data to estimate county-level social distancing. COVID-19 incidence and mortality data were from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. Generalized linear mixed models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between objective social distancing and COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Stay-at-home orders were associated with a 35% increase in social distancing. Higher social distancing was associated with a 29% reduction in COVID-19 incidence (adjusted IRR 0.71; 95% CI 0.57-0.87) and a 35% reduction in COVID-19 mortality (adjusted IRR 0.65; 95% CI 0.55-0.76). These findings provide evidence to inform ongoing national discussions on the effectiveness of these public health measures and the potential implications of returning to normal social activity.","Vopham, T.; Weaver, M.

5467,A Nationwide Survey of UK cardiac surgeons view on clinical decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BackgroundNo firm recommendations are currently available to guide decision making for patients requiring cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Systematic appraisal of national expert consensus can be used to generate interim recommendations until data from clinical observations will become available. Hence, we aimed to collect and quantitatively appraise nationwide UK senior surgeons opinion on clinical decision making for patients requiring cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsWe mailed a web-based questionnaire to all consultant cardiac surgeons through the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland (SCTS) mailing list on the 17th April 2020 and we pre-determined to close the survey on the 21st April 2020. This survey was primarily designed to gather information on UK surgeons opinion using 12 items. Strong consensus was predefined as an opinion shared by at least 60% of responding consultants.

ResultsA total of 86 consultant surgeons undertook the survey. All UK cardiac units were represented by at least one consultant. Strong consensus was achieved for the following key questions:1) before hospital admission every patient should receive nasopharyngeal swab, PCR and chest CT; 2) the use of full PPE should to be adopted in every case by the theatre team regardless patients COVID-19 status; 3) the risk of COVID-19 exposure for patients undergoing heart surgery should be considered moderate to high and likely to increase mortality if it occurs; 4) cardiac procedure should be decided based on ad-hoc multidisciplinary team discussion for every patient. The majority believed that both aortic and mitral surgery should be considered in selected cases. The role of CABG surgery during the pandemic was more controversial.

ConclusionsIn the current unprecedented scenario, the present survey provides information for generating interim recommendations until data from clinical observations will become available.

Perspective statementSystematic appraisal of national expert consensus can be used to generate interim recommendations for patients undergoing cardiac surgery during COVID-19 pandemic until data from clinical observations will become available.

Central messageNo firm recommendations are currently available to guide decision making for patients requiring cardiac surgery during the pandemic. This can translate into significant variability in clinical practice and patients outcomes across cardiac units. Systematic appraisal of national expert consensus can represent a rapid and efficient instrument to provide support to heath policy makers and other stakeholders in generating interim recommendations until data from clinical observations will become available.","Benedetto, U.; Goodwin, A.; Kendall, S.; Uppal, R.; Akowuah, E.",2020-04-29,Cardiovascular Medicine,10.1101/2020.04.24.20078105,1,Umberto Benedetto,"Bristol Heart Institute, University Hospitals bristol NHS Foundation Trust",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.24.20078105v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.24.20078105v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2020.05.016
18487,Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease does not significantly alter major COVID-19 outcomes among veterans,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well as its common causes (e.g., diabetes and obesity), are recognized risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness. To explore whether the most common inherited cause of CKD, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), is also an independent risk factor, we studied data from the VA health system and the VA COVID-19-shared resources (e.g., ICD codes, demographics, pre-existing conditions, pre-testing symptoms, and post-testing outcomes). Among 61 COVID-19-positive ADPKD patients, 21 (34.4%) were hospitalized, 10 (16.4%) were admitted to ICU, 4 (6.6%) required ventilator, and 4 (6.6%) died by August 18, 2020. These rates were comparable to patients with other cystic kidney diseases and cystic liver-only diseases. ADPKD was not a significant risk factor for any of the four outcomes in multivariable logistic regression analyses when compared with other cystic kidney diseases and cystic liver-only diseases. In contrast, diabetes was a significant risk factor for hospitalization [OR 2.30 (1.61, 3.30), p<0.001], ICU admission [OR 2.23 (1.47, 3.42), p<0.001], and ventilator requirement [OR 2.20 (1.27, 3.88), p=0.005]. Black race significantly increased the risk for ventilator requirement [OR 2.00 (1.18, 3.44), p=0.011] and mortality [OR 1.60 (1.02, 2.51), p=0.040]. We also examined the outcome of starting dialysis after COVID-19 confirmation. The main risk factor for starting dialysis was CKD [OR 6.37 (2.43, 16.7)] and Black race [OR 3.47 (1.48, 8.1)]. After controlling for CKD, ADPKD did not significantly increase the risk for newly starting dialysis comparing with other cystic kidney diseases and cystic liver-only diseases. In summary, ADPKD did not significantly alter major COVID-19 outcomes among veterans when compared to other cystic kidney and liver patients.","Cui, X.; Gallini, J. W.; Jasien, C.

10249,"Derivation and Validation of Clinical Prediction Rule for COVID-19 Mortality in Ontario, Canada","BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 is currently causing a high mortality global pandemic. However, the clinical spectrum of disease caused by this virus is broad, ranging from asymptomatic infection to cytokine storm with organ failure and death. Risk stratification of individuals with COVID-19 would be desirable for management, prioritization for trial enrollment, and risk stratification. We sought to develop a prediction rule for mortality due to COVID-19 in individuals with diagnosed infection in Ontario, Canada.

MethodsData from Ontarios provincial iPHIS system were extracted for the period from January 23 to May 15, 2020. Both logistic regression-based prediction rules, and a rule derived using a Cox proportional hazards model, were developed in half the study and validated in remaining patients. Sensitivity analyses were performed with varying approaches to missing data.

Results21,922 COVID-19 cases were reported. Individuals assigned to the derivation and validation sets were broadly similar. Age and comorbidities (notably diabetes, renal disease and immune compromise) were strong predictors of mortality. Four point-based prediction rules were derived (base case, smoking excluded as a predictor, long-term care excluded as a predictor, and Cox model based). All rules displayed excellent discrimination (AUC for all rules > 0.92) and calibration (both by graphical inspection and P > 0.50 by Hosmer-Lemeshow test) in the derivation set. All rules performed well in the validation set and were robust to random replacement of missing variables, and to the assumption that missing variables indicated absence of the comorbidity or characteristic in question.

ConclusionsWe were able to use a public health case-management data system to derive and internally validate four accurate, well-calibrated and robust clinical prediction rules for COVID-19 mortality in Ontario, Canada. While these rules need external validation, they may be a useful tool for clinical management, risk stratification, and clinical trials.","Fisman, D.; Greer, A.

13414,Outcomes of Persons With COVID-19 in Hospitals With and Without Standard Treatment With (Hydroxy)chloroquine,"ObjectiveTo compare survival of subjects with COVID-19 treated in hospitals that either did or did not routinely treat patients with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.

MethodsWe analysed data of COVID-19 patients treated in 9 hospitals in the Netherlands. Inclusion dates ranged from February 27th 2020, to May 15th, when the Dutch national guidelines no longer supported the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine. Seven hospitals routinely treated subjects with (hydroxy)chloroquine, two hospitals did not. Primary outcome was 21-day all-cause mortality. We performed a survival analysis using log-rank test and Cox-regression with adjustment for age, sex and covariates based on premorbid health, disease severity, and the use of steroids for adult respiratory distress syndrome, including dexamethasone.

ResultsAmong 1893 included subjects, 21-day mortality was 23.4% in 1552 subjects treated in hospitals that routinely prescribed (hydroxy)chloroquine, and 17.0% in 341 subjects that were treated in hospitals that did not. In the adjusted Cox-regression models this difference disappeared, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.17 (95%CI 0.88-1.55). When stratified by actually received treatment in individual subjects, the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine was associated with an increased 21-day mortality (HR 1.58; 95%CI 1.25-2.01) in the full model.

ConclusionsAfter adjustment for confounders, mortality was not significantly different in hospitals that routinely treated patients with (hydroxy)chloroquine, compared with hospitals that did not. We compared outcomes of hospital strategies rather than outcomes of individual patients to reduce the chance of indication bias. This study adds evidence against the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine in patients with COVID-19.","Peters, E. J.; Collard, D.; Van Assen, S.; Beudel, M.; Bomers, M.

11508,"RT-PCR testing to detect a COVID-19 outbreak in Austria: rapid, accurate and early diagnosis in primary care (The REAP study)","BackgroundDelay in COVID-19 detection has led to a major pandemic. We report rapid early detection of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), comparing it to the serostatus of convalescent infection, at an Austrian National Sentinel Surveillance Practice in an isolated ski-resort serving a population of 22,829 people.

MethodsRetrospective dataset of all 73 patients presenting with mild to moderate flu-like symptoms to a sentinel practice in the ski-resort of Schladming-Dachstein, Austria, between 24 February and 03 April, 2020. We split the outbreak in two halves, by dividing the period from the first to the last case by two, to characterise the following three cohorts of patients with confirmed infection: people with reactive RT-PCR presenting during the first half (early acute infection) vs. those presenting in the second half (late acute), and people with non-reactive RT-PCR (late convalescent). For each cohort we report the number of cases detected, the accuracy of RT-PCR and the duration of symptoms. We also report multivariate regression of 15 clinical symptoms as covariates, comparing all people with convalescent infection to those with acute infection.

FindingsAll 73 patients had SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. 22 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, comprising: 8 patients presenting early acute, and 7 presenting late acute and 7 late convalescent respectively; 44 patients tested SARS-COV-2 negative, and 7 were excluded. RT-PCR sensitivity was high (100%) among acute presenters, but dropped to 50% in the second half of the outbreak; specificity was 100%. The mean duration of symptoms was 2 days (range 1-4) among early acute presenters, and 4.4 days (1-7) among late acute and 8 days (2-12) among late convalescent presenters respectively. Convalescent infection was only associated with loss of taste (ORs=6.02;p=0.047). Acute infection was associated with loss of taste (OR=571.72;p=0.029), nausea and vomiting (OR=370.11;p=0.018), breathlessness (OR=134.46;p=0.049), and myalgia (OR=121.82;p=0.032); but not loss of smell, fever or cough.

InterpretationRT-PCR rapidly and reliably detects early COVID-19 among people presenting with viral illness and multiple symptoms in primary care, particularly during the early phase of an outbreak. RT-PCR testing in primary care should be prioritised for effective COVID-19 prevention and control.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSA comprehensive and effective test-trace-isolate (TTI) strategy is necessary to keep track of current and future COVID-19 infection in the UK and avoid a secondary wave later this year, as society reopens. As part of a wider TTI strategy, it is important to assess the feasibility of COVID-19 testing in primary care. We searched PubMed for implementation of SARS-CoV-2 testing in primary care using the following search terms: (""SARS-CoV-2"" OR ""COVID-19"") AND ""testing"" AND (""primary care"" OR ""general practice""). We did not find any studies that met these criteria.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, our study provides first evidence that extension of a National Influenza Surveillance Programme to include SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing in primary care leads to viral detection among patients presenting with mild to moderate flu-like illness during a local outbreak of COVID-19. We show that the sensitivity of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the technique to detect viral RNA, is high (100%) in the initial phase of the outbreak and among patients who were acutely unwell. Acute infection was associated with multiply symptoms: loss of taste, nausea and vomiting, breathlessness, myalgia and sore throat; but not loss of smell, fever or cough. We also show high correlation between reactive RT-PCR and seropositivity.

Implications of all available evidenceOur findings suggest that RT-PCR can rapidly and reliably detect early COVID-19 among people presenting with viral illness and multiple symptoms in primary care, particularly during the early phase of an outbreak. Furthermore RT-PCR testing in primary care can effectively detect new COVID-19 clusters in the community and should be included in any strategy for prevention and control of the disease.","Leber, W.; Lammel, O.; Redlberger-Fritz, M.; Mustafa-Korninger, M.

19661,A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis for COVID-19 Treatments,"BackgroundNumerous interventions for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been investigated by randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) aim to provide a comprehensive evaluation of efficacy of available treatments for COVID-19.

MethodsWe searched for candidate COVID-19 studies in WHO COVID-19 Global Research Database, PubMed, PubMed Central, LitCovid, Proquest Central and Ovid up to December 19, 2020. RCTs for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients were included, regardless of publication status or demographic characteristics. Bayesian NMA with fixed effects was conducted to estimate the effect sizes using posterior means and 95% equal-tailed credible intervals (CrIs), while that with random effects was carried out as well for sensitivity analysis. Bayesian hierarchical models were used to estimate effect sizes of treatments grouped by their drug classifications.

ResultsWe identified 96 eligible RCTs with a total of 51187 patients. Compared with the standard of care (SOC), this NMA showed that dexamethasone led to lower risk of mortality with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.85 (95% CrI [0.76, 0.95]; moderate certainty) and lower risk of mechanical ventilation (MV) with an OR of 0.68 (95% CrI [0.56, 0.83]; low certainty). For hospital discharge, remdesivir (OR 1.37, 95% CrI [1.15, 1.64]; moderate certainty), dexamethasone (OR 1.20, 95% CrI [1.08, 1.34]; low certainty), interferon beta (OR 2.15, 95% CrI [1.26, 3.74]; moderate certainty), tocilizumab (OR 1.40, 95% CrI [1.05, 1.89]; moderate certainty) and baricitinib plus remdesivir (OR 1.75, 95% CrI [1.28, 2.39]; moderate certainty) could all increase the discharge rate respectively. Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor indicated lower risk of MV (OR 0.20, 95% CrI [0.10, 0.40]; moderate certainty); and patients receiving convalescent plasma resulted in better viral clearance (OR 2.28, 95% CrI [1.57, 3.34]; low certainty). About two-thirds of the studies included in this NMA were rated as high risk of bias, and the certainty of evidence was either low or very low for most of the comparisons.

ConclusionThe Bayesian NMA identified superiority of several COVID-19 treatments over SOC in terms of mortality, requirement of MV, hospital discharge and viral clearance. These results provide a comprehensive comparison of current COVID-19 treatments and shed new light on further research and discovery of potential COVID-19 treatments.","Zhang, C.; Jin, H.; Wen, Y.; Yin, G.",2020-12-22,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.12.21.20248621,1,Guosheng Yin,The University of Hong Kong,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.21.20248621v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.21.20248621v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
17421,"Longitudinal testing for respiratory and gastrointestinal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in day care centres in Hesse, Germany. Results of the SAFE KiDS Study","BackgroundWith the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 ongoing in Europe in July of 2020, day care centres were reopened in the state of Hesse, Germany, after the lockdown. The role young children play in the dynamics of the transmission was unknown.

MethodsWe conducted a longitudinal study over a period of 12 weeks (18th of June 2020 to 10th of September, 2020) to screen attendees and staff from day care centres in the state of Hesse, Germany, for both respiratory and gastrointestinal shedding of SARS-CoV-2. 825 children (age range 3 months to 8 years) and 372 staff members from 50 day care centres, which were chosen representatively from throughout the state, participated in the study. Parents were asked to perform both a buccal mucosa and an anal swab on their children once a week. Staff were asked to self-administer the swabs. RT-PCRs for SARS-CoV-2 were performed in a multiple-swab pooling protocol.

Findings7,366 buccal mucosa swabs and 5,907 anal swabs were analysed. No respiratory or gastrointestinal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in any of the children. Shedding of SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in two staff members from distinct day care centres. One was asymptomatic at the time of testing, and one was symptomatic.

InterpretationRespiratory or gastrointestinal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in children or staff members in day care centres was very rare in the context of low community activity. The data indicate day care centres do not pose a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 in a low prevalence setting, no inapparent transmissions were observed.

FundingThe study was commissioned by the Hessian Ministry of Social Affairs and Integration and was supported by Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland.","Hoehl, S.; Kreutzer, E.; Schenk, B.; Westhaus, S.; Foppa, I.; Herrmann, E.; Ettrich, I.; Schaible, A.; Rudych, O.; Rabenau, H.

3643,Surge capacities and predicted demands of Brazil's health system associated with severe COVID-19 cases,"ObjectiveTo estimate surge capacities and demands of Brazils health system in view of severe cases of the novel coronavirus disease.

MethodsThree types of hospital equipments demanded by severe COVID-19 patients are considered: available intensive care unit (ICU) beds, existing surgery operating rooms and respirators located in other hospital areas. They are taken into account on a cumulative basis forming three levels of hospital equipment usage. Based on a mean duration of hospitalization for the disease, it is estimated the daily admission capacity of infected patients per state and for the entire country for each level of hospital equipment usage. Furthermore, an exponential regression model is fitted by means of the daily national number of new documented patients. The prediction intervals for the number of new patients for certain days in the immediate future are then calculated and compared to the admissible daily demand for the three incremental groups of equipments. The data are made publicly available by the Brazilian federal government and are gathered and analyzed by means of the Python programming language.

Results41% of the (adult) ICU beds in Brazil were available during 2019, indicating that this hospital equipment is not on average operating near capacity in national numbers. Nevertheless, there is a marked heterogeneity in the absolute and relative numbers of available and existing ICU beds and existing surgery operating rooms and extra respirators between its states.

ConclusionsThe remarkable differences between states reflect into the number of possible daily admissions of COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure for the three considered levels of hospital equipment usage. In national numbers, Brazils health system is estimated to be capable of daily admitting 693, 1243 and 2166 severe patients under the three studied scenarios. The fitted model predicted that only the first limit, if any, would be reached.","Cavalcante, E. L. B.; Ferreira, J. C.

12670,Clinical course and severity outcome indicators among COVID 19 hospitalized patients in relation to comorbidities distribution Mexican cohort,"IntroductionCOVID-19 affected worldwide, causing to date, around 500,000 deaths. In Mexico, by April 29, the general case fatality was 6.52%, with 11.1% confirmed case mortality and hospital recovery rate around 72%. Once hospitalized, the odds for recovery and hospital death rates depend mainly on the patients comorbidities and age. In Mexico, triage guidelines use algorithms and risk estimation tools for severity assessment and decision-making. The studys objective is to analyze the underlying conditions of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Mexico concerning four severity outcomes.

Materials and MethodsRetrospective cohort based on registries of all laboratory-confirmed patients with the COVID-19 infection that required hospitalization in Mexico. Independent variables were comorbidities and clinical manifestations.

Dependent variables were four possible severity outcomes(a) pneumonia, (b) mechanical ventilation (c) intensive care unit, and (d) death; all of them were coded as binary Results: We included 69,334 hospitalizations of laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized patients to June 30, 2020. Patients were 55.29 years, and 62.61% were male. Hospital mortality among patients aged<15 was 9.11%, 51.99% of those aged >65 died. Male gender and increasing age predicted every severity outcome. Diabetes and hypertension predicted every severity outcome significantly. Obesity did not predict mortality, but CKD, respiratory diseases, cardiopathies were significant predictors.

ConclusionObesity increased the risk for pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, and intensive care admittance, but it was not a predictor of in-hospital death. Patients with respiratory diseases were less prone to develop pneumonia, to receive mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit assistance, but they were at higher risk of in-hospital death.","Carrillo, G.; Mendez Dominguez, N.; Santos Zaldivar, K.

15728,Large scale sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from one region allows detailed epidemiology and enables local outbreak management,"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world. In the UK, the initial peak was in April 2020; in the county of Norfolk (UK) and surrounding areas, which has a stable, low-density population, over 3,200 cases were reported between March and August 2020. As part of the activities of the national COVID-19 Genomics Consortium (COG-UK) we undertook whole genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes present in positive clinical samples from the Norfolk region. These samples were collected by four major hospitals, multiple minor hospitals, care facilities and community organisations within Norfolk and surrounding areas. We combined clinical metadata with the sequencing data from regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes to understand the origins, genetic variation, transmission and expansion (spread) of the virus within the region and provide context nationally. Data were fed back into the national effort for pandemic management, whilst simultaneously being used to assist local outbreak analyses. Overall, 1,565 positive samples (172 per 100,000 population) from 1,376 cases were evaluated; for 140 cases between two and six samples were available providing longitudinal data. This represented 42.6% of all positive samples identified by hospital testing in the region and encompassed those with clinical need, and health and care workers and their families. 1,035 cases had genome sequences of sufficient quality to provide phylogenetic lineages. These genomes belonged to 26 distinct global lineages, indicating that there were multiple separate introductions into the region. Furthermore, 100 genetically-distinct UK lineages were detected demonstrating local evolution, at a rate of [~]2 SNPs per month, and multiple co-occurring lineages as the pandemic progressed. Our analysis: identified a discrete sublineage associated with 6 care facilities; found no evidence of reinfection in longitudinal samples; ruled out a nosocomial outbreak; identified 16 lineages in key workers which were not in patients indicating infection control measures were effective; found the D614G spike protein mutation which is linked to increased transmissibility dominates the samples and rapidly confirmed relatedness of cases in an outbreak at a food processing facility. The large-scale genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples has provided valuable additional data for public health epidemiology in the Norfolk region, and will continue to help identify and untangle hidden transmission chains as the pandemic evolves.

6578,Associations between ambient air pollutants exposure and case fatality rate of COVID-19: a multi-city ecological study in China.,"BackgroundEnvironmental factors, including air pollution, can strongly impact on spatio-temporal patterns of infectious diseases outbreak. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association and correlation between ambient air pollutants and case fatality rate (CFR) of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China.

MethodsPublicly accessible data on COVID-19 average CFR were utilized in the data analysis. The ambient daily air pollutants including fine particulate matter (PM2.5), inhalable particles (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) during the period from December 25, 2019 to March 5, 2020 were obtained from National Air Quality Real-time Publishing System of China. Ecological analysis was performed to explore the association and correlation between the cumulative average exposure of ambient air pollutants at different lag days (14 and 28 days) and average CFR in China outside Hubei and cities in Hubei province via model fitting.

ResultsThe average case fatality rate was highest in Wuhan city (4.53%) and the cumulative average exposure of ambient PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 at lag 28 days was 55.8{+/-}12.1g/m3, 66.8{+/-}9.2g/m3, 20.7{+/-}4.4g/m3, respectively in Hubei province during the study period. Ecological analysis showed that ambient PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 exposure at both lag 14 and 28 days was positively correlated with average CFR in China outside Hubei (province-level). For city-level analysis in Hubei, significant associations were only found between cumulative ambient NO2 exposure and average CFR(r=0.693 for Lag0-14, r=0.697 for Lag0-28, respectively) during the same period.

ConclusionOur findings suggested ambient PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 exposure, especially at 28 lag days, positively associated with the case fatality rate of COVID-19 in China. These results could help provide guidance for identifying potential exposure window and preventing and controlling the epidemic.","Zhang, T.; Zhao, G.; Luo, L.; Li, Y.; Shi, W.",2020-05-10,Occupational And Environmental Health,10.1101/2020.05.06.20088682,1,Wenming Shi,Clinical and Translational Research Center of Shanghai First Maternity & Infant Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.20088682v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.20088682v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
16591,Risks and Benefits of Antibiotics vs. COVID-19 Morbidity and Mortality,"ObjectivesThe purpose is to analyze the potential association of each antibiotic consumption rate and use ratio with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and to investigate the efficacy and safe use of antibiotics against COVID-19.

DesignRetrospective statistical analysis study of antibiotic use compared with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

MethodsEach antibiotic defined daily dose (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day as each antibiotic consumption rate was available in the official reports and each antibacterial use ratio data was calculated from them. Coronavirus Disease data were obtained from the WHO Coronavirus Disease Dashboard. The relationships between the sum of DDD, each antibacterial DDD, each antibiotic use ratio, and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality were examined. The statistical correlation was calculated by univariate linear regression analysis and expressed by Pearsons correlation coefficient.

ResultsThe sum of DDD had no statistical correlation with mortality and morbidity. Cephalosporins were a negative correlation with them. Penicillins had a weak positive correlation with them. Macrolides, quinolones, and sulfonates showed a slightly negative correlation tendency with mortality.

ConclusionsCephalosporins may affect less COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Penicillins suggest to accelerate them. The combination of cephalosporins with macrolides or quinolones may be a helpful treatment. The difference in antibiotic use between Japan and EU/EEA countries will suggest an explanation for the reduction in morbidity and mortality caused by COVID-19.","Tanioka, H.; Tanioka, S.",2020-10-20,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.10.15.20213603,1,Hisaya Tanioka,Tanioka Clinic,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.20213603v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.20213603v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
19731,"Reducing contacts to stop SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the second pandemic wave in Brussels, Belgium","BackgroundReducing contacts is a cornerstone of containing SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated the effect of physical distancing measures and of school reopening on contacts and consequently on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Brussels, a hotspot during the second European wave.

MethodsUsing SARS-CoV-2 case reports and contact tracing data during August-November 2020, we estimated changes in the age-specific number of reported contacts. We associated these trends with changes in the instantaneous reproduction number Rt and in age-specific transmission-events during distinct intervention periods in the Brussels region. Furthermore, we analysed trends in age-specific case numbers, pre- and post-school opening.

FindingsWhen schools reopened and physical distancing measures relaxed, the weekly mean number of reported contacts surged from 2.01 (95%CI 1.73-2.29) to 3.04 (95%CI 2.93-3.15), increasing across all ages. The fraction of cases aged 10-19 years started increasing before school reopening, with no further increase following school reopening (risk ratio 1.23, 95%CI 0.79-1.94). During the subsequent month, 8.9% (67/755) of infections identified were from teenagers to other ages, while 17.0% (131/755) from other ages to teenagers. Rt peaked mid-September at 1.48 (95%CI 1.35-1.63). Reintroduction of physical distancing measures reduced reported contacts to 1.85 (95%CI 1.78-1.91), resulting in Rt dropping below 1 within 3 weeks.

InterpretationThe second pandemic wave in Brussels was the result of increased contacts across all ages following school reopening. Stringent physical distancing measures, including closure of bars and limiting close contacts while schools remain open, reduced social mixing, in turn controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

10027,Observational Study of Metformin and Risk of Mortality in Patients Hospitalized with Covid-19,"ImportanceType 2 diabetes (T2DM) and obesity are significant risk factors for mortality in Covid19. Metformin has sex specific immunomodulatory effects which may elucidate treatment mechanisms in COVID-19. Objective: We sought to identify whether metformin reduced mortality from Covid19 and if sex specific interactions exist.

DesignRetrospective review of de-identified claims from UnitedHealth Groups Clinical Discovery Database. Unadjusted and multivariate models were conducted to assess risk of mortality based on metformin and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) inhibitors as home medications in individuals with T2DM and obesity, controlling for comorbidities, medications, demographics, and state. Heterogeneity of effect was assessed by sex.

SettingThe database includes all 50 states in the United States. Participants: Persons with at least 6 months of continuous coverage from UnitedHealth Group in 2019 who were hospitalized with Covid-19. Persons in the metformin group had > 90 days of metformin claims in the 12 months before hospitalization.

Results6,256 persons were included; 52.8% female; mean age 75 years. Metformin was associated with decreased mortality in women by logistic regression, OR 0.792 (0.640, 0.979); mixed effects OR 0.780 (0.631, 0.965); Cox proportional-hazards: HR 0.785 (0.650, 0.951); and propensity matching, OR of 0.759 (0.601, 0.960). There was no significant reduction in mortality among men. TNF inhibitors were associated with decreased mortality, by propensity matching in a limited model, OR 0.19 (0.0378, 0.983).

ConclusionsMetformin was significantly associated with reduced mortality in women with obesity or T2DM in observational analyses of claims data from individuals hospitalized with Covid-19. This sex-specific finding is consistent with metformins reduction of TNF in females over males, and suggests that metformin conveys protection in Covid-19 through TNF effects. Prospective studies are needed to understand mechanism and causality.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSMetformin has many anti-inflammatory effects, including sex-specific effects on TNF. Is metformin protective from the Sars-CoV-2 virus, and does the effect differ by sex?

FindingsMetformin was associated with reduced mortality in women who were hospitalized with Covid-19, but not in men who were hospitalized with Covid-19.

8380,Lessons from movement ecology for the return to work: modeling contacts and the spread of COVID-19,"Human behavior (movement, social contacts) plays a central role in the spread of pathogens like SARS- CoV-2. The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 was driven by global human movement, and initial lockdown measures aimed to localize movement and contact in order to slow spread. Thus, movement and contact patterns need to be explicitly considered when making reopening decisions, especially regarding return to work. Here, as a case study, we consider the initial stages of resuming research at a large research university, using approaches from movement ecology and contact network epidemiology. First, we develop a dynamical pathogen model describing movement between home and work; we show that limiting social contact, via reduced people or reduced time in the workplace are fairly equivalent strategies to slow pathogen spread. Second, we develop a model based on spatial contact patterns within a specific office and lab building on campus; we show that restricting on-campus activities to labs (rather than labs and offices) could dramatically alter (modularize) contact network structure and thus, potentially reduce pathogen spread by providing a workplace mechanism to reduce contact. Here we argue that explicitly accounting for human movement and contact behavior in the workplace can provide additional strategies to slow pathogen spread that can be used in conjunction with ongoing public health efforts.","Shaw, A.

MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted among non-healthcare-related participants after a stay-at-home directive was implemented. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with anxiety, perceived seriousness of COVID-19 and loneliness.

ResultsA total of 464 participants responded to the survey. Most participants recognized cough, shortness of breath and fever as primary symptoms of COVID-19. Nearly 50% reported high levels of anxiety to COVID-19 and 48% reported being loneliness during the social isolation. Higher level of COVID-19 knowledge was associate with higher levels with anxiety. Being married had 1.79 times higher levels of anxiety about COVID-19. Women were less likely to report loneliness than men. Older age was associated with taking the pandemic seriously, and was also associated with loneliness during the social isolation.

ConclusionsIt is crucial for the public health authorities not only provide accurate and scientific information about the COVID-19 promoting protective behavior changes but also to minimize anxiety through supportive messages and recommendations for positive coping strategies and timely offering mental health counselling services for those in need.","Ha, T.; Schensul, S.; Lewis, J.; Brown, S.",2020-05-20,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.18.20082073,1,Toan Ha,UConn School of Medicine,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.18.20082073v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.18.20082073v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

DesignCross-sectional bibliometric review of COVID-19 literature. A parallel search of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) literature was performed for comparison of outcomes.

Data sourcesMEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The search for COVID-19 studies was performed between 1st November 2019 and 24th March 2020. The search for MERS studies was performed one year earlier between 1st November 2018 and 24th March 2019.

Main outcome measuresInvestigator-responsiveness was assessed by measuring the volume and type of published research. Editorial-responsiveness was assessed by measuring the time from manuscript submission to acceptance and the availability of original data to support the study results. Publisher-responsiveness was assessed by measuring the time from manuscript acceptance to first publication and the provision of open access.

ResultsIn total, 398 of 2835 COVID-19 and 55 of 1513 MERS search results were eligible. Most COVID-19 studies were clinical reports (n=242; 60.8%) and the majority of these were case series (n=105; 43.4%) and single cases (n=65; 26.9%). The times from manuscript submission to acceptance (median: 5 days (IQR: 3-11) vs 71.5 days (38-106); P<0.001) and acceptance to publication (median: 5 days (IQR: 2-8) vs. 22.5 days (4-48.5-; P<0.001) were strikingly shorter for COVID-19. Almost all COVID-19 (n=396; 99.5%) and MERS (n=55; 100%) studies were available with open-access. Data sharing was infrequent, with original data available for 104 (26.1%) COVID-19 and 10 (18.2%) MERS studies (P=0.203).

ConclusionsThe early academic response to COVID-19 was characterised by investigators aiming to define the disease.

12617,Risk stratification of patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 using the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol: development and validation of the 4C Mortality Score,"ObjectivesTo develop and validate a pragmatic risk score to predict mortality for patients admitted to hospital with covid-19.

DesignProspective observational cohort study: ISARIC WHO CCP-UK study (ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium [4C]). Model training was performed on a cohort of patients recruited between 6 February and 20 May 2020, with validation conducted on a second cohort of patients recruited between 21 May and 29 June 2020.

Setting260 hospitals across England, Scotland, and Wales.

ParticipantsAdult patients ([&ge;]18 years) admitted to hospital with covid-19 admitted at least four weeks before final data extraction.

Main outcome measuresIn-hospital mortality.

ResultsThere were 34 692 patients included in the derivation dataset (mortality rate 31.7%) and 22 454 in the validation dataset (mortality 31.5%). The final 4C Mortality Score included eight variables readily available at initial hospital assessment: age, sex, number of comorbidities, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, level of consciousness, urea, and C-reactive protein (score range 0-21 points). The 4C risk stratification score demonstrated high discrimination for mortality (derivation cohort: AUROC 0.79; 95% CI 0.78 - 0.79; validation cohort 0.78, 0.77-0.79) with excellent calibration (slope = 1.0). Patients with a score [&ge;]15 (n = 2310, 17.4%) had a 67% mortality (i.e., positive predictive value 67%) compared with 1.0% mortality for those with a score [&le;]3 (n = 918, 7%; negative predictive value 99%). Discriminatory performance was higher than 15 pre-existing risk stratification scores (AUROC range 0.60-0.76), with scores developed in other covid-19 cohorts often performing poorly (range 0.63-0.73).

ConclusionsWe have developed and validated an easy-to-use risk stratification score based on commonly available parameters at hospital presentation. This outperformed existing scores, demonstrated utility to directly inform clinical decision making, and can be used to stratify inpatients with covid-19 into different management groups. The 4C Mortality Score may help clinicians identify patients with covid-19 at high risk of dying during current and subsequent waves of the pandemic.

11573,Estimate of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 using real time tracking of health care workers.,"BACKGROUNDWhether and to what degree SARS-CoV-2 is spread via the airborne route is unknown. Using data collected from health care worker interactions with hospitalized patients with COVID-19 illness, we calculated the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 via the airborne route.

OBJECTIVES/METHODSHealthcare worker interaction with SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were tracked using a real time location system between March 18 and March 31. A value for q, the transmissibility expressed as quanta per hour, was estimated using a well-established model for airborne transmission.

RESULTSSARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence among tracked HCWs was 2.21% (0.07-4.35). Transmissibility was estimated to be 0.225 quanta per hour, well below other well-characterized airborne pathogens. Simulations demonstrated that risk of infection is substantially reduced with increased ventilation of rooms.

CONCLUSIONSOverall, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not well transmitted via the airborne route in controlled conditions. We speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may be only opportunistically airborne, with most transmission occurring via droplet methods.

2432,"Early, low-dose and short-term application of corticosteroid treatment in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia: single-center experience from Wuhan, China","BackgroundSevere patients with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia progressed rapidly to acute respiratory failure. We aimed to evaluate the definite efficacy and safety of corticosteroid in the treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

MethodsForty-six hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia hospitalized at Wuhan Union Hospital from January 20 to February 25, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether they received corticosteroid treatment. The clinical symptoms and chest computed tomography(CT) results were compared.

ResultsA total of 26 patients received intravenous administration of methylprednisolone with a dosage of 1-2mg/kg/d for 5-7 days, while the remaining patients not. There was no significant difference in age, sex, comorbidities, clinical or laboratory parameters between the two groups on admission. The average number of days for body temperature back to the normal range was significantly shorter in patients with administration of methylprednisolone when compared to those without administration of methylprednisolone (2.06{+/-}0.28 vs. 5.29{+/-}0.70, P=0.010). The patients with administration of methylprednisolone had a faster improvement of SpO2, while patients without administration of methylprednisolone had a significantly longer interval of using supplemental oxygen therapy (8.2days[IQR 7.0-10.3] vs. 13.5days(IQR 10.3-16); P<0.001). In terms of chest CT, the absorption degree of the focus was significantly better in patients with administration of methylprednisolone.

ConclusionOur data indicate that in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early, low-dose and short-term application of corticosteroid was associated with a faster improvement of clinical symptoms and absorption of lung focus.","Wang, Y.; Jiang, W.; He, Q.; Wang, C.; Wang, B.; Zhou, P.; Dong, N.; Tong, Q.",2020-03-12,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.06.20032342,1,Nianguo Dong,"Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032342v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032342v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
17148,"Pre-existing conditions are associated with long-COVID patients hospitalization, despite confirmed clearance of SARS-CoV-2 virus","The current diagnostic gold-standard for SARS-CoV-2 clearance from infected patients is two consecutive negative PCR test results. However, there are anecdotal reports of hospitalization from protracted COVID complications despite such confirmed viral clearance, presenting a clinical conundrum. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 266 COVID patients to compare those that were admitted/re-admitted post-viral clearance (hospitalized post-clearance cohort, n=93) with those that were hospitalized pre-clearance but were not re-admitted post-viral clearance (non-hospitalized post-clearance cohort, n=173). In order to differentiate these two cohorts, we used neural network models for the augmented curation of comorbidities and complications with positive sentiment in the EHR physician notes. In the year preceding COVID onset, acute kidney injury (n=15 (16.1%), p-value: 0.03), anemia (n=20 (21.5%), p-value: 0.02), and cardiac arrhythmia (n=21 (22.6%), p-value: 0.05) were significantly enriched in the physician notes of the hospitalized post-clearance cohort. This study highlights that these specific pre-existing conditions are associated with amplified hospitalization risk in COVID patients, despite their successful SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance. Our finding that pre-COVID anemia amplifies risk of post-COVID hospitalization is particularly concerning given the high prevalence and endemic nature of anemia in many low- and middle-income countries (per the World Bank definition; e.g. India, Brazil), which are unfortunately also seeing high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-induced mortality. This study motivates follow-up prospective research into the specific risk factors we have identified that appear to predispose some patients towards the after effects of COVID-19.

Article summary - Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThis is the first study at a major healthcare center analyzing risk factors for post-viral clearance hospitalization of COVID-19 patients.
C_LIO_LIThis analysis uses augmented curation methods to identify complications and comorbidities from the physician notes, rather than relying upon ICD codes.
C_LIO_LIThe statistical analysis identifies specific comorbidities in the year preceding PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 which are associated with increased rates of post-viral clearance hospitalization.
C_LIO_LIThe dataset used for this study is limited to a single healthcare system, so the underlying clinical characteristics of the study population are biased to reflect the clinical characteristics of individuals that receive medical treatment in certain regions of the United States (Arizona, Florida, Minnesota).
C_LIO_LIIn this study, we use the first of two consecutive negative PCR tests to estimate the viral clearance date for each patient, however the true viral clearance date for each patient is unknown.

12527,COVID-19 case-fatality rate and demographic and socioeconomic influencers: a worldwide spatial regression analysis based on country-level data,"We used the COVID-19 dataset obtained from the Our World in Data website and investigated the associations between COVID-19 CFR and nine country-level indices of 209 countries/territories using the Matern correlation regression model. Spatial dependence among the data was controlled using the latitude and longitude of the centroid of the countries/territories. Stratified analyses were conducted by economic level and COVID-19 testing policy. The average of country/territory-specific COVID-19 CFR is about 2-3% worldwide, which is higher than previously reported at 0.7-1.3%. Statistically significant associations were observed between COVID-19 CFR and population size and proportion of female smokers. The open testing policies are associated with decreased CFR. Strictness of anti-COVID-19 measures was not statistically significantly associated with CFR overall, but the higher stringency index was associated with higher CFR in higher income countries with active testing policies. The statistically significant association between population size and COVID-19 CRF suggests the healthcare strain and lower treatment efficiency in countries with large populations. The observed association between smoking in females and COVID-19 CFR might be due to that the proportion of female smokers reflected broadly income level of a country. When testing is warranted and healthcare resources are sufficient, strict quarantine and/or lockdown measures might result in excess deaths in underprivileged populations.","Cao, Y.; Hiyoshi, A.; Montgomery, S.",2020-07-31,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.07.31.20165811,1,Yang Cao,Orebro University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.31.20165811v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.31.20165811v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
19327,Vaccine Prioritisation Using Bluetooth Exposure Notification Apps,"After vaccinating health care workers and vulnerable groups against COVID-19, authorities will need to decide how to vaccinate everyone else. Prioritising individuals with more contacts can be disproportionately effective, in theory, but identifying these individuals is difficult. Here we show that the technology underlying Bluetooth exposure notification applications, such as used for digital contact tracing, can be leveraged to prioritise vaccination based on individual contact data. Our approach is based on the insight that these apps also act as local sensing devices measuring each users total exposure time to other users, thereby enabling the implementation of a previously impossible strategy that prioritises potential super-spreaders. Furthermore, by generalising percolation theory and introducing a novel measure of vaccination efficiency, we demonstrate that this ""hot-spotting"" strategy can achieve herd immunity with up to half as many vaccines as a non-targeted strategy, and is attractive even for relatively low rates of app usage.","Penney, M.

17382,Precision shielding for COVID-19: metrics of assessment and feasibility of deployment,"BackgroundThe ability to preferentially protect high-groups in COVID-19 is hotly debated. Here, the aim is to present simple metrics of such precision shielding of people at high-risk of death after infection by SARS-CoV-2; demonstrate how they can estimated; and examine whether precision shielding was successfully achieved in the first COVID-19 wave.

MethodsThe shielding ratio, S, is defined as the ratio of prevalence of infection among people at a high-risk group versus among people in a low-risk group. The contrasted risk groups examined here are according to age (>=70 versus <70 years), and institutionalized (nursing home) setting. For age-related precision shielding, data were used from large seroprevalence studies with separate prevalence data for elderly versus non-elderly and with at least 1000 assessed people >=70 years old. For setting-related precision shielding, data were analyzed from 10 countries where information was available on numbers of nursing home residents, proportion of nursing home residents among COVID-19 deaths, and overall population infection fatality rate.

FindingsAcross 17 seroprevalence studies, the shielding ratio S for elderly versus non-elderly varied between 0.4 (substantial shielding) and 1.6 (substantial inverse protection, i.e. low-risk people being protected more than high-risk people). Five studies in USA all yielded S=0.4-0.8, consistent with some shielding being achieved, while two studies in China yielded S=1.5-1.6, consistent with inverse protection. Assuming 25% infection fatality rate among nursing home residents, S values for nursing home residents ranged from 0.07 to 3.1. The best shielding was seen in South Korea (S=0.07) and modest shielding was achieved in Israel, Slovenia, Germany, and Denmark. No shielding was achieved in Hungary and Sweden. In Belgium (S=1.9), UK (S=2.2) and Spain (S=3.1), nursing home residents were far more frequently infected that the rest of the population.

InterpretationThe experience from the first wave of COVID-19 suggests that different locations and settings varied markedly in the extent to which they protected high-risk groups. Both effective precision shielding and detrimental inverse protection can happen in real-life circumstances. COVID-19 interventions should seek to achieve maximal precision shielding.","Ioannidis, J.",2020-11-04,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.11.01.20224147,1,John Ioannidis,Stanford University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.01.20224147v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.01.20224147v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004614
7377,Flatten the Curve! Modeling SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 Growth in Germany on the County Level,"Since the emerging of the ""novel coronavirus"" SARS-CoV-2 and the corresponding respiratory disease COVID-19, the virus has spread all over the world. Being one of the most affected countries in Europe, in March 2020, Germany established several nonpharmaceutical interventions to contain the virus spread, including the closure of schools and child day care facilities (March 16-18, 2020) as well as a full ""lockdown"" with forced social distancing and closures of ""nonessential"" services (March 23, 2020). The present study attempts to analyze whether these governmental interventions had an impact on the declared aim of  flattening the curve"", referring to the epidemic curve of new infections. This analysis is conducted from a regional perspective. On the level of the 412 German counties, logistic growth models were estimated based on daily infections (estimated from reported cases), aiming at determining the regional growth rate of infections and the point of inflection where infection rates begin to decrease and the curve flattens. All German counties exceeded the peak of new infections between the beginning of March and the middle of April. In a large majority of German counties, the epidemic curve has flattened before the ""lockdown"" was established. In a minority of counties, the peak was already exceeded before school closures. The growth rates of infections vary spatially depending on the time the virus emerged. Counties belonging to states which established an additional curfew show no significant improvement with respect to growth rates and mortality. Furthermore, mortality varies strongly across German counties, which can be attributed to infections of people belonging to the ""risk group"", especially residents of retirement homes. The results raise the question whether social ban measures and curfews really contribute to curve flattening within a pandemic.","Wieland, T.",2020-11-03,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.14.20101667,5,Thomas Wieland,Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.14.20101667v5?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.14.20101667v5.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
18490,Symptom-based prediction model of SARS-CoV-2 infection developed from self-reported symptoms of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals in an online survey,"BackgroundInfections with the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have quickly reached pandemic proportions and are causing a global health crisis. First recognized for the induction of severe disease, the virus also causes asymptomatic infections or infections with mild symptoms that can resemble common colds. Since infections with mild course are probably a major contributor to the spread of SARS-CoV-2, better detection of such cases is important. To provide better understanding of these mild SARS-CoV-2 infections and to improve information for potentially infected individuals, we performed a detailed analysis of self-reported symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals.

MethodsIn an online-based survey, 963 individuals provided information on symptoms associated with an acute respiratory infection, 336 of the participants had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 107 had tested negative, and 520 had not been tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsThe symptoms reported most frequently by SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals were tiredness, loss of appetite, impairment of smell or taste and dry cough. The symptoms with the highest odds ratios between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative individuals were loss of appetite and impairment of smell or taste. Based on the most distinguishing symptoms, we developed a Bayesian prediction model, which had a positive predictive value of 0.80 and a negative predictive value of 0.72 on the SARS-CoV-2 tested individuals. The model predicted 56 of 520 non-tested individuals to be SARS-CoV-2 positive with more than 75% probability, and another 84 to be SARS-CoV-2 positive with probability between 50% and 75%.

ConclusionsA combination of symptoms can provide a good estimate of the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Schulze, H.; Hoffmann, D.; Bayer, W.",2020-11-30,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.11.25.20236752,2,Wibke Bayer,"Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.25.20236752v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.25.20236752v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
8798,"When ""Shelter-in-Place"" Isn't Shelter That's Safe: A Rapid Analysis of Domestic Violence Case Differences During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Stay-at-Home Orders","PurposeThis study explored the COVID-19 pandemics impacts on domestic violence (DV) with the following research questions: 1) Did DV occurring during the pandemic differ on certain variables from cases occurring on a typical day the previous year? 2) Did DV occurring after the implementation of shelter-in-place orders differ (on these same variables) from cases occurring prior to shelter-in-place orders?

MethodsTwo logistic regression models were developed to predict DV case differences before and during the pandemic. DV reports (N = 4618) were collected from the Chicago Police Department. Cases from March 2019 and March 2020 were analyzed based on multiple variables. One model was set to predict case differences since the pandemic began, and another model was set to predict case differences during the shelter-inplace period later that month.

ResultsBoth models were significant with multiple significant predictors. During the pandemic period, cases with arrests were 3% less likely to have occurred, and cases at residential locations were 22% more likely to have occurred. During the shelter-inplace period, cases at residential locations were 64% more likely to have occurred, and cases with child victims were 67% less likely to have occurred.

ConclusionsThis study offers a rapid analysis of DV case differences since the pandemic and shelter-in-place began. Additional variables and data sources could improve model explanatory power. Research, policy, and practice in this area must pivot to focus on protecting children whose access to mandated reporters has decreased and moving victims out of dangerous living situations into safe spaces.","Mclay, M.

3126,Mechanical Ventilator Milano (MVM):A Novel Mechanical Ventilator Designed for Mass Scale Production in response to the COVID-19 Pandemics,"We present here the design of the Mechanical Ventilator Milano (MVM), a novel mechanical ventilator designed for mass scale production in response to the COVID-19 pandemics, to compensate for the dramatic shortage of such ventilators in many countries. This ventilator is an electro-mechanical equivalent of the old, reliable Manley Ventilator. Our design is optimized to permit large sale production in short time and at a limited cost, relying on off-the-shelf components, readily available worldwide from hardware suppliers. Operation of the MVM requires only a source of compressed oxygen (or compressed medical air) and electrical power. The MVM control and monitoring unit can be connected and networked via WiFi so that no additional electrical connections are necessary other than the connection to the electrical power.

At this stage the MVM is not a certified medical device. Construction of the first prototypes is starting with a team of engineers, scientists and computing experts. The purpose of this paper is to disseminate the conceptual design of the MVM broadly and to solicit feed-back from the scientific and medical community to speed the process of review, improvement and possible implementation.","Cristiano, G.; Bonivento, W.; Caravati, M.; Razeti, M.; Dececco, S.; Fiorillo, G.; Gabriele, F.; Tartaglia, R.; Razeto, A.; Sablone, D.; Scapparone, E.; Testera, G.; Rescigno, M.; Franco, D.; Kochanek, I.; Kendziora, C.; Pordes, S.

5476,Concentration-dependent mortality of chloroquine in overdose,"Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are used extensively in malaria and rheumatological conditions, and now in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Although generally safe they are potentially lethal in overdose. In-vitro data suggest that high concentrations and thus high doses are needed for COVID-19 infections, but as yet there is no convincing evidence they are clinically effective. Bayesian regression models were fitted to survival outcomes and electrocardiograph QRS durations from 302 prospectively studied French patients who had taken intentional chloroquine overdoses, of whom 33 died (11%), and 16 healthy volunteers who took 620 mg base chloroquine single doses. Whole blood concentrations of 13.5 mol/L (95% credible interval 10.1-17.7) were associated with 1% mortality. Prolongation of ventricular depolarisation is concentration-dependent with a QRS duration >150 msec independently highly predictive of mortality. Pharmacokinetic modelling combined with these lethality data predicts that the majority of chloroquine regimens trialled in COVID-19 should not cause serious cardiovascular toxicity.","Watson, J.

18838,Mapping each pre-existing conditions association to short-term and long-term COVID-19 complications,"Understanding the relationships between pre-existing conditions and complications of COVID-19 infection is critical to identifying which patients will develop severe disease. Here, we leverage 1.1 million clinical notes from 1,903 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and deep neural network models to characterize associations between 21 pre-existing conditions and the development of 20 complications (e.g. respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, and hematologic) of COVID-19 infection throughout the course of infection (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days, and 61-90 days). Pleural effusion was the most frequent complication of early COVID-19 infection (23% of 383 complications) followed by cardiac arrhythmia (12% of 383 complications). Notably, hypertension was the most significant risk factor associated with 10 different complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac arrhythmia and anemia. Furthermore, novel associations between cancer (risk ratio: 3, p=0.02) or immunosuppression (risk ratio: 4.3, p=0.04) with early-onset heart failure have also been identified. Onset of new complications after 30 days is rare and most commonly involves pleural effusion (31-60 days: 24% of 45 patients, 61-90 days: 25% of 36 patients). Overall, the associations between pre-COVID conditions and COVID-associated complications presented here may form the basis for the development of risk assessment scores to guide clinical care pathways.","Venkatakrishnan, A.; Pawlowski, C.; Zemmour, D.; Hughes, T.; Anand, A.; Berner, G.; Kayal, N.; Puranik, A.; Conrad, I.; Bade, S.; Barve, R.; Sinha, P.; O'horo, J.; Badley, A.

3208,Virus shedding patterns in nasopharyngeal and fecal specimens of COVID-19 patients,"Diagnosis is the key point for confirmation and treatment of COVID-19. we focused on comparative analysis of virus dynamics between the upper respiratory and feces specimens in the COVID-19 patients. A total of 66 upper respiratory swabs, 51 feces, 56 urine and 56 plasma samples were sequentially collected from 23 patients in a designated hospital. The plasma and urine samples were all negative, except for urine samples from two severe cases at the latest available detection point. Conversely, virus was shed in respiratory swabs and feces samples during the diseased period. Ten of 12 (83.3%) cases were positive for feces samples, while 14 of 21 (66.7%) were positive for respiratory samples. In addition, the median duration of virus shedding was 10.0 days (IQR 8.0 to 17.0) in the upper respiratory swabs, but was 22.0 days (IQR 15.5 to 23.5) for the feces. Notably, at 26 days after discharge, case 3 (a 45-year-old) was detected positive again in the feces samples, but appears to be healthy and negative for respiratory swabs. These results indicated that beside respiratory samples, intestinal samples (e.g. feces) should be recommended for diagnosis of COVID-19, especially before a patient discharge and for monitoring the relapse of discharged patients.","Zhang, N.; Gong, Y.; Meng, F.; Bi, Y.; Yang, P.; Wang, F.",2020-03-30,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.28.20043059,1,Yuhai Bi,"CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Center for Influenza Research and Early-warning (CASCIRE), Chinese Acad",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20043059v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20043059v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1007/s11427-020-1783-9

14749,On the reliability of predictions on Covid-19 dynamics: a systematic and critical review of modelling techniques,"Since the beginning of the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV disease (Covid-19) in December 2019, there has been an exponential number of studies using diverse modelling techniques to assess the dynamics of transmission of the disease, predict its future course and determine the impact of different control measures. In this study, we conducted a global systematic literature review to summarize trends in the modelling techniques used for Covid-19 from January 1st 2020 to June 30th 2020. We further examined the reliability and correctness of predictions by comparing predicted and observed values for cumulative cases and deaths. From an initial 2170 peer-reviewed articles and preprints found with our defined keywords, 148 were fully analyzed. We found that most studies on the modelling of Covid-19 were from Asia (52.70%) and Europe (25%). Most of them used compartmental models (SIR and SEIR) (57%) and statistical models (growth models and time series) (28%) while few used artificial intelligence (5%) and Bayesian approach (3%). For cumulative cases, the ratio predicted/observed values and the ratio of the amplitude of confidence interval (CI) or credibility interval (CrI) of predictions and the central value were on average larger than 1 (4.49 {+/-} 9.98 and 1.10 {+/-} 1.94, respectively) indicating cases of incorrect predictions, large uncertainty on predictions, and large variation across studies. There was no clear difference among models used for these two ratios. However, the ratio predicted/observed values was relatively smaller for SIR models than for SEIR models, indicating that more complex models might not be more accurate for predictions. We further found that values of both ratios decreased with the number of days covered by studies, indicating that the wider the time covered by the data, the higher the correctness and accuracy of predictions. In 21.62% of studies, observed values fall within the CI or CrI of the cumulative cases predicted by studies. Only six of the 148 selected studies (4.05%) predicted the number of deaths. For 33.3% of these predictions, the ratio of predicted to actual number of deaths was close to 1. We also found that the Bayesian model made predictions closer to reality than the compartmental and the statistical models, although these differences are only suggestive due to the small size of the data. Our findings suggest that while predictions made by the different models are useful to understand the pandemic course and guide policy-making, there should be cautious in their usage.","Gnanvi, J.

9329,COVID-19 infections and outcomes in patients with multiple myeloma in New York City: a cohort study from five academic centers,"ImportanceNew York City is a global epicenter for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with a significant number of individuals infected by the virus. Patients with multiple myeloma have a compromised immune system, due to both the disease and anti-myeloma therapies, and may therefore be particularly susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, there is limited information to guide clinical management.

ObjectiveTo assess risk factors and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with multiple myeloma.

DesignCase-series.

SettingFive large academic centers in New York City.

ParticipantsPatients with multiple myeloma and related plasma cell disorders who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 10th, 2020 and April 30th, 2020.

ExposuresClinical features and risk factors were analyzed in relation to severity of COVID-19.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresDescriptive statistics as well as logistic regression were used to estimate disease severity reflected in hospital admissions, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for mechanical ventilation, or death.

ResultsOf 100 multiple myeloma patients (male 58%; median age 68, range 41-91) diagnosed with COVID-19, 74 (74%) were admitted; of these 13 (18%) patients were placed on mechanical ventilation, and 18 patients (24%) expired. None of the studied risk factors were significantly associated (P>0.05) with adverse outcomes (ICU-admission, mechanical ventilation, or death): hypertension (N=56) odds ratio (OR) 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9-5.9); diabetes (N=18) OR 1.1 (95% CI 0.3-3.2); age >65 years (N=63) OR 2.0 (95% CI 0.8-5.3); high dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplant <12 months (N=7) OR 1.2 (95% CI 0.2-7.4), IgG<650 mg/dL (N=42) OR=1.2 (95% CI 0.4-3.1). In the entire series of 127 patients with plasma cell disorders, hypertension was significantly associated with the combined end-point (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.5-8.1).

Conclusions and RelevanceAlthough multiple myeloma patients have a compromised immune system due to both the disease and therapy; in this largest disease specific cohort to date of patients with multiple myeloma and COVID-19, compared to the general population, we found risk factors for adverse outcome to be shared and mortality rates to be within the higher range of officially reported mortality rates.","Hultcrantz, M.; Richter, J.; Rosenbaum, C.; Patel, D.; Smith, E.; Korde, N.; Lu, S.; Mailankody, S.; Shah, U.; Lesokhin, A.; Hassoun, H.; Tan, C.; Maura, F.; Derkach, A.; Diamond, B.; Rossi, A.; Pearse, R.

3826,The distress of Iranian adults during the Covid-19 pandemic - More distressed than the Chinese and with different predictors,"Early papers on the mental health of the public during the Covid-19 pandemic surveyed participants from China. Outside of China, Iran has emerged as one of the most affected countries with a high death count and rate. The paper presents the first empirical evidence from Iranian adults during the Covid-19 pandemic on their level of distress and its predictors. On March 25-28, 2020, a dire time for Covid-19 in Iran, we surveyed 1058 adults from all 30 provinces in Iran using the Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). The distress level of Iranian adults (mean: 34.54; s.d.: 14.92) was significantly higher (mean difference: 10.9; t=22.7; p<0.0001; 95% CI: 10.0 to 11.8) than that of Chinese adults (mean: 23.65; s.d.: 5.45) as reported in a prior study with the same measure of Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). We also found the predictors of distress in Iran vary from those in China. Our findings that the predictors of distress in Iran vary from those in China suggest the need to study the predictors of mental health in individual countries during the Covid-19 pandemic to effectively identify and screen for those more susceptible to mental health issues.

12851,Analysis of SIR-Network Model on COVID-19 with respect to its impact on West Bengal in India,"The recent global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) disease has prompted many researchers to formulate lock-down and quarantine scenarios while the main concern of the researchers is to model the spread and the possible duration of the COVID-19 infections and also research on how long this is going to last. It seems that most of the researchers have recognized lock-down as one of the major impact factors in their models. As a result of this in the absence of lock-down the models formulated would not contribute much significant results. Hence, in this work we decide to formulate a mathematical model which would be able to predict the spread and also the possible duration of the pandemic, by considering both partial lock-down and the corresponding unlocking situations. Employing SIR-network models and taking the various districts of highly populated areas of West Bengal, India as the nodes or vertices we attempt to model the spread and duration of the pandemic during both partial lock-down and unlock phases but separately. We consider the populations where the locally present people and the people who have undergone migration of some shorts are well mixed together. In the network that we have provided the pointed edges refer to the migrating workers that is those that move away from their regular habitats in want of work. We use this research to study not only the trends that are associated with COVID-19 outbreaks, but also to study the impacts of the Government policies and the improvisation of medical facilities on this outbreak in West Bengal. At the end, we attempt to throw light upon the crisis that the economy of the state may have to go through separately on partial lock-down and unlocking scenarios.","Khatua, D.; Guha, D.; Kar, S.; De, A.; Samanta, E.",2020-08-06,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.08.05.20169037,1,Debnarayan Khatua,Global Institute of Science and Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20169037v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20169037v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
14948,Words Matter: Political and gender analysis of speeches made by heads of government during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on political leadership and decision-making around the world. Differences in how leaders address the pandemic through public messages have practical implications for building trust and an effective response within a country. Methods: We analyzed the public statements and speeches made by 20 heads of government around the world (Bangladesh, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Finland, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Scotland, Sint Maarten, United Kingdom, United States, Taiwan) to highlight the differences between men and women leaders in discussing COVID-19 and pandemic response. We used a deductive analytical approach, coding speeches for specific themes based on language used and content discussed. Findings: Five primary themes emerged across a total of 122 speeches on COVID-19 made by heads of government: economics and financial relief, social welfare and vulnerable populations, nationalism, responsibility and paternalism, and emotional appeals. While all leaders described the economic impact of the pandemic, women leaders spoke more frequently about the impact on local or individual scale. Women leaders were also more often found describing a wider range of social welfare services, including addressing to: mental health, substance abuse, and domestic violence. Both men and women from lower-resource settings described detailed financial relief and social welfare support that would impact the majority of their citizen population. While 17 of the 20 leaders used war metaphors to describe the COVID-19 virus and response, men largely used these with greater volume and frequency. Conclusion: While this analysis does not attempt to answer whether men or women are more effective leaders in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, it does provide insight into the rhetorical tools and types of language used by different leaders during a national and international crisis. This language is important because it influences how leaders inspire citizens to adhere to the social contract, and the priorities they highlight and the words they use are meant to resonate with the rest of the nation.","Dada, S.; Ashworth, H.

12955,The SARS-COV-2 outbreak around the Amazon rainforest: the relevance of the airborne transmission,"BackgroundThis paper presents a global analysis of the SARS-COV-2 outbreak in Brazil.

Amazonian States have a much higher contamination rate than the southern and southeastern States. So far, no explanation has been provided for this striking difference that can shed light on the airborne transmission of the virus.

Minimizing airborne transmission, health authorities recommend two meters as a safe distance. However, recent experiments reveal that this can be the main form of contagion. There is a lack of theoretical explanation on how airborne transmission works.

MethodsTo investigate the spread of SARS-COV-2 in different macro environments, we analyzed the daily official data on the evolution of COVID-19 in Brazil. We compared our epidemiologic results obtained in States with very different climatic characteristics, and that had adopted, almost simultaneously, similar social isolation measures. To understand the virus spread, it was necessary to calculate theoretically the movement and behavior in the air of saliva droplets.

FindingsThe transmission of SARS-COV-2 is much faster in the Amazon rainforest region.

Our theoretical calculations explain and support the empirical results observed in recent experiments that demonstrate the relevance of aerial transmission of the coronavirus.

InterpretationAn onset of collective immunity may have been achieved with a contamination rate of about 15% of the Amazonian population. If confirmed, this result will have an essential impact on the management of the pandemic across the planet.

The airborne transmission played a decisive role in the striking difference in the evolution of the pandemic among Brazilian regions.

Air humidity is the most important climatic factor in viral spreading, while usual ambient temperatures do not have strong influence.

There is no safe indoor distance for the coronavirus transmission. So, mask and eye protection are essential.","Crema, E.",2020-08-07,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.08.06.20169433,1,Edilson Crema,University of Sao Paulo,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.06.20169433v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.06.20169433v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144312
9113,"Interplay of global multi-scale human mobility, social distancing, government interventions, and COVID-19 dynamics","This work quantifies mobility changes observed during the different phases of the pandemic world-wide at multiple resolutions - county, state, country - using an anonymized aggregate mobility map that captures population flows between geographic cells of size 5 km2. As we overlay the global mobility map with epidemic incidence curves and dates of government interventions, we observe that as case counts rose, mobility fell and has since then seen a slow but steady increase in flows. Further, in order to understand mixing within a region, we propose a new metric to quantify the effect of social distancing on the basis of mobility.Taking two very different countries sampled from the global spectrum, We analyze in detail the mobility patterns of the United States (US) and India. We then carry out a counterfactual analysis of delaying the lockdown and show that a one week delay would have doubled the reported number of cases in the US and India. Finally, we quantify the effect of college students returning back to school for the fall semester on COVID-19 dynamics in the surrounding community. We employ the data from a recent university outbreak (reported on August 16, 2020) to infer possible Reff values and mobility flows combined with daily prevalence data and census data to obtain an estimate of new cases that might arrive on a college campus. We find that maintaining social distancing at existing levels would be effective in mitigating the extra seeding of cases. However, potential behavioral change and increased social interaction amongst students (30% increase in Reff) along with extra seeding can increase the number of cases by 20% over a period of one month in the encompassing county. To our knowledge, this work is the first to model in near real-time, the interplay of human mobility, epidemic dynamics and public policies across multiple spatial resolutions and at a global scale.","Adiga, A.; Wang, L.; Sadilek, A.; Tendulkar, A.; Venkatramanan, S.; Vullikanti, A.; Aggarwal, G.; Talekar, A.; Ben, X.; Chen, J.; Lewis, B.; Swarup, S.; Tambe, M.; Marathe, M.",2020-08-24,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.06.05.20123760,4,Madhav Marathe,University of Virginia,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.05.20123760v4?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.05.20123760v4.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
6217,Post-exposure Prophylaxis or Preemptive Therapy for SARS-Coronavirus-2: Study Protocol for a Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial,"BackgroundThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Currently, there are a lack of evidence-based therapies to prevent COVID-19 following exposure, or to prevent worsening of symptoms following confirmed infection. We describe the design of a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine for post-exposure prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy for COVID-19.

MethodsWe will conduct two nested multicenter international double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine for: 1) post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of asymptomatic household contacts or healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 within the past four days, and 2) pre-emptive therapy (PET) for symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19 with a total symptom duration of less than 4 days. We will recruit 1500 patients for each the PEP and PET trials. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive 5 days of hydroxychloroquine or placebo. The primary PEP trial outcome will be the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 disease. The primary PET trial outcome will be an ordinal scale of disease severity (not hospitalized; hospitalized without intensive care, hospitalization with intensive care, or death). Participant screening, informed consent, and follow up will be exclusively internet-based with appropriate regulatory and research ethics board approvals in Canada and the United States.

DiscussionThese complementary randomized control trials are innovatively designed and adequately powered to rapidly answer urgent questions regarding the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine to reduce transmission and disease severity of COVID-19 during a pandemic. In-person participant follow-up will not be conducted in order to facilitate social distancing strategies and reduce risks of exposure to study personnel. Innovative trial approaches are needed to urgently assess therapeutic options to mitigate the global impact of this pandemic.

13509,On the use of growth models for forecasting epidemic outbreaks with application to COVID-19 data,"The initial phase dynamics of an epidemic without containment measures is commonly well modeled using exponential growth models. However, in the presence of containment measures, the exponential model becomes less appropriate. Under the implementation of an isolation measure for detected infectives, we propose to model epidemic dynamics by fitting a flexible growth model curve to reported positive cases and to infer the overall epidemic dynamics by introducing information on the detection/testing effort and recovery and death rates. The resulting modeling approach is close to the SIQR (Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered) model framework. We focused on predicting the peaks (time and size) in positive cases, actives cases and new infections. We applied the approach to data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. Fits on limited data before the observed peaks illustrate the ability of the flexible growth model to approach the estimates from the whole data.","Tovissode, C. F.; Lokonon, B.

A buffer with the ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 at the time of sample collection could simplify and expand testing for COVID-19 to non-conventional settings.

MethodsWe evaluated a guanidium thiocyanate-based buffer, eNAT (Copan) as a possible transport and inactivation medium for downstream RT-PCR testing to detect SARS-CoV-2. Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 in eNAT and in diluted saliva was studied at different incubation times. The stability of viral RNA in eNAT was also evaluated for up to 7 days at room temperature (28{degrees}C), refrigerated conditions (4{degrees}C) and at 35{degrees}C.

ResultsSARS-COV-2 virus spiked directly in eNAT could be inactivated at >5.6 log10 PFU/ml within a minute of incubation. When saliva was diluted 1:1 in eNAT, no cytopathic effect (CPE) on vero-E6 cell lines was observed, although SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected even after 30 min incubation and after two cell culture passages. A 1:2 (saliva:eNAT) dilution abrogated both CPE and detectable viral RNA after as little as 5 min incubation in eNAT. SARS-CoV-2 RNA from virus spiked at 5X the limit of detection remained positive up to 7 days of incubation in all tested conditions.

ConclusioneNAT and similar guanidinium thiocyanate-based media may be of value for transport, preservation, and processing of clinical samples for RT-PCR based SARS-CoV-2 detection.","Banik, S.; Saibire, K.; Suryavanshi, S.; Johns, G.; Chakravorty, S.; Kwiatkawoski, R.; Alland, D.; Banada, P.

11380,"Who is wearing a mask? Gender-, age-, and location-related differences during the COVID-19 pandemic","Masks are an effective tool in combatting the spread of COVID-19, but some people still resist wearing them and mask-wearing behavior has not been experimentally studied in the United States. To understand the demographics of mask wearers and resistors, and the impact of mandates on mask-wearing behavior, we observed shoppers (n = 9935) entering retail stores during periods of June, July, and August 2020. Approximately 41% of the June sample wore a mask. At that time, the odds of an individual wearing a mask increased significantly with age and was also 1.5x greater for females than males. Additionally, the odds of observing a mask on an urban or suburban shopper were ~4x that for rural areas. Mask mandates enacted in late July and August increased mask-wearing compliance to over 90% in all groups, but a small percentage of resistors remained. Thus, gender, age, and location factor into whether shoppers in the United States wear a mask or face covering voluntarily. Additionally, mask mandates are necessary to increase mask wearing among the public to a level required to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.","Haischer, M. H.; Beilfuss, R.; Hart, M.

14419,Decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA viruses from N95 level meltblown polypropylene fabric using heat under different humidities,"In March of 2020, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The pandemic led to a shortage of N95-grade filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), especially for protection of healthcare professionals against airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We and others have previously reported promising decontamination methods that may be applied to the recycling and reuse of FFRs. In this study we tested disinfection of three viruses including SARS-CoV-2, dried on a piece of meltblown fabric, the principal component responsible for filtering of fine particles in N95-level FFRs, under a range of temperatures (60-95{degrees}C) at ambient or 100% relative humidity (RH) in conjunction with filtration efficiency testing. We found that heat treatments of 75{degrees}C for 30 min or 85{degrees}C for 20 min at 100% RH resulted in efficient decontamination from the fabric of SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), and another enveloped RNA virus, chikungunya virus vaccine strain 181 (CHIKV-181), without lowering the meltblown fabrics filtration efficiency.","Campos, R.

19252,Deep Learning Fusion for COVID-19 Diagnosis,"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease has spurred a tremendous research boost aiming at controlling it. Under this scope, deep learning techniques have received even more attention as an asset to automatically detect patients infected by COVID-19 and reduce the doctors burden to manually assess medical imagery. Thus, this work considers a deep learning architecture that fuses the layers of current-state-of-the-art deep networks to produce a new structure-fused deep network. The advantages of our deep network fusion scheme are multifold, and ultimately afford an appealing COVID-19 automatic diagnosis that outbalances current deep learning methods. Indeed, evaluation on Computer Tomography (CT) and X-ray imagery considering a two-class (COVID-19/ non-COVID-19) and a four-class (COVID-19/ non-COVID-19/ Pneumonia bacterial / Pneumonia virus) classification problem, highlights the classification capabilities of our method attaining 99.3% and 100%, respectively.","Kechagias-Stamatis, O.; Aouf, N.; Koukos, J.",2020-12-14,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.12.11.20246546,1,Odysseas Kechagias-Stamatis,City University of London,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.11.20246546v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.11.20246546v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
3299,Projecting the Spread of COVID19 for Germany,"We model the evolution of the number of individuals that are reported to be sick with COVID-19 in Germany. Our theoretical framework builds on a continuous time Markov chain with four states: healthy without infection, sick, healthy after recovery or after infection but without symptoms and dead. Our quantitative solution matches the number of sick individuals up to the most recent observation and ends with a share of sick individuals following from infection rates and sickness probabilities. We employ this framework to study inter alia the expected peak of the number of sick individuals in a scenario without public regulation of social contacts. We also study the effects of public regulations. For all scenarios we report the expected end of the CoV-2 epidemic.

We have four general findings: First, current epidemiological thinking implies that the long-run effects of the epidemic only depend on the aggregate long-run infection rate and on the individual risk to turn sick after an infection. Any measures by individuals and the public therefore only influence the dynamics of spread of CoV-2. Second, predictions about the duration and level of the epidemic must strongly distinguish between the officially reported numbers (Robert Koch Institut, RKI) and actual numbers of sick individuals. Third, given the current (scarce) medical knowledge about long-run infection rate and individual risks to turn sick, any prediction on the length (duration in months) and strength (e.g. maximum numbers of sick individuals on a given day) is subject to a lot of uncertainty. Our predictions therefore offer robustness analyses that provide ranges on how long the epidemic will last and how strong it will be. Fourth, public interventions that are already in place and that are being discussed can lead to more and less severe outcomes of the epidemic. If an intervention takes place too early, the epidemic can actually be stronger than with an intervention that starts later. Interventions should therefore be contingent on current infection rates in regions or countries.

Concerning predictions about COVID-19 in Germany, we find that the long-run number of sick individuals (that are reported to the RKI), once the epidemic is over, will lie between 500 thousand and 5 million individuals. While this seems to be an absurd large range for a precise projection, this reflects the uncertainty about the long-run infection rate in Germany. If we assume that Germany will follow the good scenario of Hubei (and we are even a bit more conservative given discussions about data quality), we will end up with 500 thousand sick individuals over the entire epidemic. If by contrast we believe (as many argue) that once the epidemic is over 70% of the population will have been infected (and thereby immune), we will end up at 5 million cases.

Defining the end of the epidemic by less than 100 newly reported sick individuals per day, we find a large variation depending on the effectiveness of governmental pleas and regulations to reduce social contacts. An epidemic that is not influenced by public health measures would end mid June 2020. With public health measures lasting for few weeks, the end is delayed by around one month or two. The advantage of the delay, however, is to reduce the peak number of individuals that are simultaneously sick. When we believe in long-run infection rates of 70%, this number is equally high for all scenarios we went through and well above 1 million. When we can hope for the Hubei-scenario, the maximum number of sick individuals will be around 200 thousand ""only"".

Whatever value of the range of long-run infection rates we want to assume, the epidemic will last at least until June, with extensive and potentially future public health measures, it will last until July. In the worst case, it will last until end of August.

We emphasize that all projections are subject to uncertainty and permanent monitoring of observed incidences are taken into account to update the projection.

2254,Study of the mental health status of medical personnel dealing with new coronavirus pneumonia,"ObjectiveThis paper studied the relationship between personality traits and mental health conditions of medical personnel to provide a basis and reference for the implementation of targeted education on mental health.

MethodsA self-report inventory, the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), was used to investigate the mental health status of 548 medical personnel dealing with the new coronavirus pneumonia in eight provinces and cities of China.

ResultsThe overall mean SCL-90 score and mean values of factors (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism) of the medical personnel were significantly higher than in the norm group (p < 0.05), while their average interpersonal sensitivity score was significantly lower (p < 0.01). In addition, personal factors affecting the mental health status of medical personnel were identified. ( all p < 0.05).

ConclusionThe overall mental health status of medical personnel responding to new coronavirus pneumonia is generally higher than that of the norm group in China. The results of this study should contribute to measures to alleviate the psychological pressures on medical personnel dealing with the new coronavirus epidemic in China.","Sun, N.; Xing, J.; Xu, J.; Geng, L.

MethodsRapid review of studies that reported home-based or remote administration of an exercise test in people with chronic lung disease, and studies reporting their clinimetric properties.

Results84 studies were included. Tests used at home were the 6-minute walk test (6MWT, 2 studies), sit-to-stand tests (STS, 5 studies), Timed Up and Go (TUG, 4 studies) and step tests (2 studies). Exercise tests administered remotely were the 6MWT (2 studies) and step test (1 study). Compared to centre-based testing the 6MWT distance was similar when performed outdoors but shorter when performed at home (2 studies). The STS, TUG and step tests were feasible, reliable (intra-class correlation coefficients >0.80), valid (concurrent and known groups validity) and moderately responsive to pulmonary rehabilitation (medium effect sizes). These tests elicited less desaturation than the 6MWT, and validated methods to prescribe exercise were not reported.

DiscussionThe STS, step and TUG tests can be performed at home, but do not accurately document desaturation with walking or allow exercise prescription. Patients at risk of desaturation should be prioritised for centre-based exercise testing when this is available.","Holland, A. E.; Malaguti, C.; Hoffman, M.; Lahham, A.; Burge, A.

12708,Outcome of COVID-19 with co-existing surgical emergencies in children: our initial experiences and recommendations,"BackgroundCOVID-19 has changed the practice of surgery vividly all over the world. Pediatric surgery is not an exception. Prioritization protocols allowing us to provide emergency surgical care to the children in need while controlling the pandemic spread. The aim of this study is to share our experiences with the outcome of children with COVID-19 who had a co-existing surgical emergency.

MethodsThis is a retrospective observational study. We reviewed the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data of all patients admitted in our surgery department through the emergency department and later diagnosed to have COVID-19 by RT-PCR. The study duration was 3 months (April 2020 - June 2020). A nasopharyngeal swab was taken from all patients irrespective of symptoms to detect SARS CoV 2 by RT-PCR with the purpose of detecting asymptomatic patients and patients with atypical symptoms. Emergency surgical services were provided immediately without delay and patients with positive test results were isolated according to the hospital protocol. We divided the test positive patients into 4 age groups for the convenience of data analysis. Data were retrieved from hospital records and analyzed using SPSS (version 25) software. Ethical permission was taken from the hospital ethical review board.

ResultsTotal patients were 32. Seven (21.9%) of them were neonates. Twenty-four (75%) patients were male. The predominant diagnosis was acute abdomen followed by infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), myelomeningocele, and intussusception. Only two patients had mild respiratory symptoms (dry cough). Fever was present in 13 (40.6%) patients. Fourteen (43.8%) patients required surgical treatment. The mean duration of hospital stay was 5.5 days. One neonate with ARM died in the post-operative ward due to cardiac arrest. No patient had hypoxemia or organ failure. Seven health care workers (5.51%) including doctors & nurses got infected with SARS Co V2 during this period.

ConclusionOur study has revealed a milder course of COVID-19 in children with minimal infectivity even when present in association with emergency surgical conditions. This might encourage a gradual restart to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on childrens surgery.","Hasan, M. S.; Ali, M.

AI4CoV leveraged Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to parse through eligibility criteria of trials and patients clinical manifestations in their clinical notes, both presented in English text, to accomplish 92.76% AUROC on a cross-validation test with 3,156 patient-trial pairs labeled with ground truth of suitability. Our retrospective multiple-site review shows that according to AI4CoV, severe patients of COVID-19 generally have less treatment options suitable for them than mild and moderate patients and that suitable and unsuitable treatment options are different for each patient. Our results show that the general approach of AI4CoV is useful during the early stage of a pandemic when the best treatments are still unknown.","Hsu, A. I.; Yeh, A.; Chen, S.-L.; Yeh, J.

14846,Mask-Wearing During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background Masks have been widely recommended as a precaution against COVID-19 transmission. Several studies have shown the efficacy of masks at curbing droplet dispersion in lab settings. Using individual response data from the Imperial College London-YouGov personal measures survey, this study investigates reported mask use and its association with the spread of COVID-19. Methods We examine the association of reported mask-wearing in a population within a country with the growth rate of active cases COVID-19 cases. The analysis uses country-wide data from weekly surveys of individuals mask-wearing behavior in public places, as well as other concurrently implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions, mobility changes, new cases of COVID-19 data and other control variables. The mask-wearing data were obtained from the Imperial College-YouGov multi-country survey of peoples personal habits before and during COVID-19. Because mask-wearing showed substantial variation across countries and over time, we use a reduced form econometric model to relate population-wide changes in mask-wearing to the growth rate in COVID-19. Results The results indicate that reported mask-wearing could play an important role in mitigating the growth of COVID-19. Widespread mask-wearing within a country associates with an expected 7% (95% CI: 3.94%-9.99%) decline in the growth rate of daily active cases of COVID-19 in the country. This daily decline equates to an expected 88.5% drop in the growth of daily active cases over a 30-day period when compared to zero percent mask-wearing, all else held equal. The decline in daily growth rate due to the combined effect of reported mask-wearing, reduced social mobility, and non-pharmaceutical interventions averages 28.1% (95% CI: 24.2%-32%). These estimates remain robust across multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Face mask usage as a preventative measure against the transmission of COVID-19 varies widely across countries. This observational study uses data from 24 countries and finds that reported face mask usage associates with a decline in new COVID-19 cases. Even though the model controls for a large variety of variables that affect spread, and we run a number of robustness checks, it remains possible that some of the decline associated with face masks is related to confounding variables not included in the model. In summary, due to the confounding variables and the variations in the type of mask and its usage, randomized control trials of mask usage in populations are needed to determine the true effect of mask wearing on mitigating the transmission of infectious respiratory diseases.","Aravindakshan, A.; Boehnke, J.; Gholami, E.; Nayak, A.",2020-09-13,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.11.20192971,1,Ashwin Aravindakshan,"University of California, Davis",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20192971v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20192971v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
9339,Plasma from recovered COVID19 subjects inhibits spike protein binding to ACE2 in a microsphere-based inhibition assay,"High throughput serological tests that can establish the presence and functional activity of anti-SARS-COV2 antibodies are urgently needed. Here we present microsphere-based Flow Cytometry assays that quantify both anti-spike IgGs in plasma, and the ability of plasma to inhibit the binding of spike protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). First, we detected anti-spike-trimer IgGs in 22/24 and anti-spike-receptor-binding-domain (RBD) IgGs in 21/24 COVID+ subjects at a median of 36 (range 14-73) days following documented SARS-CoV-2 RNA (+) secretions. Next, we find that plasma from all 22/24 subjects with anti-trimer IgGs inhibited ACE2-trimer binding to a greater degree than controls, and that the degree of inhibition correlated with anti-trimer IgG levels. Depletion of trimer-reactive Igs from plasma reduced ACE2-trimer inhibitory capacity to a greater degree than depletion of RBD-reactive Igs, suggesting that inhibitory antibodies act by binding both within and outside of the RBD. Amongst the 24 subjects, presence of fever was associated with higher levels of anti-trimer IgG and inhibition of binding to human ACE2. This inhibition assay may be broadly useful to quantify the functional antibody response of recovered COVID19 patients or vaccine recipients in a cell-free assay system.","Gniffke, E.

10159,Insufficient social distancing may be related to COVID-19 outbreak: the case of Ijui city in Brazil,"The coronavirus disease initiated in 2019 (COVID-19) has proven to be highly contagious and quickly became a pandemic. Nowadays, it presents higher transmission rates worldwide, chiefly in small Brazilian cities, as Ijui. Located in the northwestern of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) with 83,475 inhabitants, Ijui was selected to receive a population-based survey organized in five steps, involving 2,222 subjects. Subjects were tested for the presence of antibodies against coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and answered questions regarding social distance adherence (SDA), daily preventive routine (DPR), comorbidities, and sociodemographic characteristics. In parallel, the local government registered the official COVID-19 cases in Ijui, and the mobile social distancing index (MSDI) was also registered. In this study, we demonstrate the decrease in the levels of SDA, DPR and MSDI before the beginning of COVID-19 community transmission in Ijui. Also, we provide predictions for cases, hospitalization, and deaths in the city. We concluded that the insufficient social distancing, evidenced by different methods, might have a strong relationship with the rapid increase of COVID-19 cases in Ijui. Our study predicts a closer outbreak of community infection of COVID-19, which could be avoided or attenuated if the levels of the social distancing in the population increase.","Heck, T.

18485,The psychosocial impact on frontline health and social care professionals in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative interview study.,"ObjectivesTo explore the psychosocial well-being of health and social care professionals working during the COVID-19 pandemic.

DesignThis was a qualitative study deploying in-depth, individual interviews, which were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was used for coding.

ParticipantsThis study involved 25 participants from a range of frontline professions in health and social care.

SettingInterviews were conducted over the phone or video call, depending on participant preference.

ResultsFrom the analysis, we identified 5 overarching themes: communication challenges, work-related stressors, support structures, personal growth, and individual resilience. The participants expressed difficulties such as communication challenges and changing work conditions, but also positive factors such as increased team unity at work, and a greater reflection on what matters in life.

ConclusionsThis study provides evidence on the support needs of health and social care professionals amid continued and future disruptions caused by the pandemic. It also elucidates some of the successful strategies (such as mindfulness, hobbies, restricting news intake, virtual socialising activities) deployed by health and social care professionals that can support their resilience and well-being and be used to guide future interventions.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThis is the first study in the UK to interview both health and social care professionals working in a range of settings on their experiences working through COVID-19.
C_LIO_LIThis study used a strong theoretical approach to inform the topic guide, and one-to-one interviews allowed in-depth analysis of the psychosocial experiences of health and social care professionals, complementing the wider availability of quantitative evidence.
C_LIO_LIWe interviewed a wide range of professions, which provided breadth of experience but might limit the specificity of findings.
C_LIO_LIGiven the fluctuating nature of the pandemic, attitudes of health and social care professionals may change over time. This can be challenging to capture during a single interview, however we did ask questions on how their experience had progressed longitudinally.
C_LIO_LIOur sample may have been biased towards people who had more free time to participate and so were coping better than others. However, our sample still described a number of stressful experiences during the pandemic, and it is also possible that workers who were frustrated or stressed wished to express their views.

12050,Superspreaders and lockdown timing explain the power law dynamics of COVID-19,"Infectious disease outbreaks are expected to grow exponentially in time, when left unchecked Measures such as lockdown and social distancing can drastically alter the growth dynamics of the outbreak. Indeed the 2019-2020 COVID-19 outbreak is characterized by a power law growth 1. Strikingly however, the power law exponent is different across countries 2. Here I illustrate the relationship between these two extreme scenarios, exponential and power law growth, based on the impact of superspreaders and lockdown strategies to contain the outbreak. The theory predicts an inverse relationship between the power law exponent and the speed of the lockdown that is validated by the observed COVID-19 data across different countries.","Vazquez, A.",2020-10-16,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.07.23.20160531,4,Alexei Vazquez,CRUK Beatson Institute,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160531v4?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160531v4.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.1103/physreve.102.040302
5757,Mathematical Model to Study Early COVID-19 Transmission Dynamics in Sri Lanka,"BackgroundWorld Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11th March. Sri Lanka is currently experiencing a cluster epidemic with a specific group of overseas returnees and their contacts. The objective of this study was to develop a mathematical model to predict the epidemic in Sri Lanka incorporating measures taken for social distancing and prevention of social gatherings.

MethodsA hybrid model incorporating both exponential and polynomial features was developed and parameters were estimated. The developed model was validated using the datasets of three reference countries. Finally, the model was applied to the Sri Lankan data to simulate the epidemic behaviour. Additional features were incorporated to the model to examine the effects of current control measures.

FindingsSri Lanka will have a peak of 177 COVID-19 active cases at the end of second incubation period from the index case of our projection, if the same trend continues. At 10% risk, we project a peak of 263 COVID-19 active cases at the end of third incubation period, and a peak of 353 at the end of fourth incubation period. Should the risk level reach 20%, the peak will be above 1000 active cases after 90 days. Simulations incorporating control measures predict that, deviation from the control measures currently in place could trigger exponential behaviour of the epidemic.

InterpretationThe hybrid model combining exponential and polynomial functions showed promising results to predict COVID-19 epidemic. Projections indicate that any early relaxation of control measures is not advisable. This methodological approach can be replicated in other settings at the initial stages of the epidemic.","Perera, S. N.; Ganegoda, N. C.; Siriwardhana, D. D.; Weerasinghe, M.

20496,An Estimation of Reproduction Number of SARS-CoV-2 by Age Class for Age Classes in Japan,"BackgroundInfectiousness of COVID-19 by age class inferred from the infection source and by infected people might be different. However, studies of such infectiousness have not been reported.

ObjectThe object of this study was estimation of reproduction numbers by age class of the source of infection and the infected persons. To do so, after examining a new procedure for reproduction number estimation, we checked infected places by age class of the source of infection and the infected persons.

MethodWe ignore patients who infected no one because their reliability might be lower than that of patients who infected more than one person. We estimated the reproduction number from the histogram of the number of the infected people by the same patient, assuming that the histogram follows an exponential distribution.

Discussion and ConclusionThe obtained results demonstrated that the effective reproduction numbers for infection from children were very low. They were higher among adult and elderly people than among the same age class. Moreover, although the highest and second-highest infected places were  other and  at home with some exceptions, the data for infection at hospitals were remarkable among adults and elderly people. Among elderly people, infection at facilities for elderly was also high. Infections at nursing schools, schools, restaurants, and entertainment venues at night were negligible.","Kurita, J.; Hata, T.; Sugawara, T.; Ohkusa, Y.; Hata, A.",2021-01-15,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.01.14.21249854,1,Atsuko Hata,"Kitano hospital, The Tazuke Kofukai Medical Research Institute",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.14.21249854v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.14.21249854v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
8715,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Among Healthcare Workers at a Tertiary Academic Hospital in New York City,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 antibody testing is important for understanding immunity prevalence, and may have implications for healthcare workers (HCW) during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

MethodsWe conducted immunologic testing of healthcare workers to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in this population. HCW were advised to wait at least two weeks from time of symptom onset or suspected exposure before undergoing testing. All participants were self-reported asymptomatic for at least three days at the time of testing.

ResultsTwo hundred eighty-five samples were collected from March 24, 2020 to April 4, 2020. The average age of participants was 38 years (range 18-84), and 54% were male. Thirty-three percept tested IgG positive, 3% tested weakly positive, and 64% tested negative. Neither age nor sex was associated with antibody development.

ConclusionThirty-six percent of HCW had IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, reflecting the high exposure of inpatient and ambulatory frontline staff to this viral illness, most of whom had minimal symptoms and were working in the weeks preceding testing. While we continue to recommend standard protective precautions per CDC guidelines for all HCW, HCW with SARS-CoV-2 IgG may become our safest frontline providers as we learn if our IgG antibodies confer immunity. Knowing IgG antibody status may ease concerns regarding personal risk as this pandemic continues.","Mansour, M.; Levin, E.; Muellers, K.; Stone, K.; Mendu, R.; Wajnberg, A.",2020-06-02,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.05.27.20090811,1,Mayce Mansour,Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.20090811v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.20090811v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1007/s11606-020-05926-8
14283,Prognostic accuracy of emergency department triage tools for children with suspected COVID-19: The PRIEST observational cohort study,"ObjectivesEmergency department clinicians can use triage tools to predict adverse outcome and support management decisions for children presenting with suspected COVID-19. We aimed to estimate the accuracy of triage tools for predicting severe illness in children presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected COVID-19 infection.

MethodsWe undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 44 EDs across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected data from children attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020, and used presenting data to determine the results of assessment using the WHO algorithm, swine flu hospital pathway for children (SFHPC), Paediatric Observation Priority Score (POPS) and Childrens Observation and Severity Tool (COAST). We recorded 30-day outcome data (death or receipt of respiratory, cardiovascular or renal support) to determine prognostic accuracy for adverse outcome.

ResultsWe collected data from 1530 children, including 26 (1.7%) with an adverse outcome. C-statistics were 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.73-0.87) for the WHO algorithm, 0.80 (0.71-0.90) for POPS, 0.76 (0.67-0.85) for COAST, and 0.71 (0.59-0.82) for SFHPC. Using pre-specified thresholds, the WHO algorithm had the highest sensitivity (0.85) and lowest specificity (0.75), but POPS and COAST could optimise sensitivity (0.96 and 0.92 respectively) at the expense of specificity (0.25 and 0.38 respectively) by using a threshold of any score above zero instead of the pre-specified threshold.

ConclusionExisting triage tools have good but not excellent prediction for adverse outcome in children with suspected COVID-19. POPS and COAST could achieve an appropriate balance of sensitivity and specificity for supporting decisions to discharge home by considering any score above zero to be positive.

9109,First environmental surveillance for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and river water in Japan,"Wastewater-based epidemiology is a powerful tool to understand the actual incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a community because severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of COVID-19, can be shed in the feces of infected individuals regardless of their symptoms. The present study aimed to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and river water in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan, using four quantitative and two nested PCR assays. Influent and secondary-treated (before chlorination) wastewater samples and river water samples were collected five times from a wastewater treatment plant and three times from a river, respectively, between March 17 and May 7, 2020. The wastewater and river water samples (200-5,000 mL) were processed by using two different methods: the electronegative membrane-vortex (EMV) method and the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. Based on the observed concentrations of indigenous pepper mild mottle virus RNA, the EMV method was found superior to the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was successfully detected in one of five secondary-treated wastewater samples with a concentration of 2.4 x 103 copies/L by N_Sarbeco qPCR assay following the EMV method, whereas all the influent samples were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This result could be attributed to higher limit of detection for influent (4.0 x 103-8.2 x 104 copies/L) with a lower filtration volume (200 mL) compared to that for secondary-treated wastewater (1.4 x 102-2.5 x 103 copies/L) with a higher filtration volume of 5,000 mL. None of the river water samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Comparison with the reported COVID-19 cases in Yamanashi Prefecture showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the secondary-treated wastewater sample when the cases peaked in the community. This is the first study reporting the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater in Japan.","Haramoto, E.; Malla, B.; Thakali, O.; Kitajima, M.",2020-06-18,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.06.04.20122747,2,Eiji Haramoto,University of Yamanashi,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.04.20122747v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.04.20122747v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140405
9371,Evaluation of the number of COVID-19 undiagnosed infected using source of infection measurements,"In times of outbreaks, an essential requirement for better monitoring is the evaluation of the number of undiagnosed infected individuals. An accurate estimate of this fraction is crucial for the assessment of the situation and the establishment of protective measures. In most current studies using epidemics models, the total number of infected is either approximated by the number of diagnosed individuals or is dependent on the model parameters and assumptions, which are often debated. We here study the relationship between the fraction of diagnosed infected out of all infected, and the fraction of infected with known contaminator out of all diagnosed infected. We show that those two are approximately the same in exponential models and across most models currently used in the study of epidemics, independently of the model parameters. As an application, we compute an estimate of the effective number of infected by the COVID-19 virus in Israel.","Melka, A.

4933,Mortality from COVID-19 in 12 countries and 6 states of the United States,"ImportanceReliable estimates of COVID-19 mortality are crucial to aid control strategies and to assess the effectiveness of interventions.

ObjectiveProject COVID-19 mortality trends to October 1, 2020, in 12 countries or regions that constitute >90% of the global COVID-19 deaths reported as of April 12, 2020.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThe Global COVID-19 Assessment of Mortality (GCAM) is an open, transparent, and continuously updated (www.cghr.org/covid) statistical model that combines actual COVID-19 mortality counts with Bayesian inference to forecast COVID-19 deaths, the date of peak deaths, and the duration of excess mortality. The analyses covered a total of 700 million population above age 20 in 12 countries or regions: USA; Italy; Spain; France; UK; Iran; Belgium; a province of China (Hubei, which accounted for 90% of reported Chinese deaths); Germany; the Netherlands; Switzerland; and Canada; and six US states: New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Louisiana, California, and Washington.

ResultsForecasted deaths across the 12 current high-burden countries sum 167,000 to 593,000 (median 253,000). The trajectory of US deaths (49,000-249,000 deaths; median 86,000)--over half of which are expected in states beyond the initial six states analysed in this study--will have the greatest impact on the eventual total. Mortality ranges are 25,000-109,000 (median 46,000) in the UK; 23,000-31,000 (median 26,000) in Italy; 21,000-37,000 (median 26,000) in France and 21,000-32,000 (median 25,000) in Spain. Estimates are most precise for Hubei, China--where the epidemic curve is complete--and least precise in California, where it is ongoing. New York has the highest cumulative median mortality rate per million (1135), about 12-fold that of Germany. Mortality trajectories are notably flatter in Germany, California, and Washington State, each of which took physical distancing and testing strategies seriously. Using past country-specific mortality as a guide, GCAM predicts surge capacity needs, reaching more than twice existing capacity in a number of places., In every setting, the results might be sensitive to undercounts of COVID-19 deaths, which are already apparent.

Conclusion and RelevanceMortality from COVID-19 will be substantial across many settings, even in the best case scenario. GCAM will provide continually updated and increasingly precise estimates as the pandemic progresses.

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has already caused over 115,000 deaths, with global deaths doubling every week.1-3 Mortality is less biased than case reporting, which is affected by testing policies. However, the daily reporting of COVID-19 deaths is already known to undercount actual deaths, varying over time and place.4-6

Reliable estimates of total COVID-19 mortality, the date of peak deaths, and of the duration of excess mortality are crucial to aid responses to the current and potential future pandemics. We have developed the Global COVID-19 Assessment of Mortality (GCAM), a statistical model to project COVID-19 mortality trends to October 1 2020 in 12 countries or regions that constitute >90% of the global COVID-19 deaths reported as of April 12th. We report also on six US states that account for 70% of the American totals to date (Supplementary Appendix).1 We quantify the COVID-19 mortality trajectory ranges in each setting. A semi-automated website (www.cghr.org/covid) provides daily updates. GCAM is open, transparent, and uses a reasonably simple method that employs publicly reported mortality data to make plausible projections. The method is designed to improve as more mortality data become available over longer time periods.","Brown, P.; Jha, P.; Cghr Covid Mortality Consortium,  ",2020-04-22,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.17.20069161,1,Prabhat Jha,University of Toronto,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069161v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069161v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
15475,"Safety and immunogenicity of the Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine candidate: interim results of a phase 1/2a, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial","BACKGROUND The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be controlled by an efficacious vaccine. Multiple vaccines are in development, but no efficacious vaccine is currently available. METHODS We designed a multi-center phase 1/2a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study to assesses the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S, a non-replicating adenovirus 26 based vector expressing the stabilized pre-fusion spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Ad26.COV2.S was administered at a dose level of 5x1010 or 1x1011 viral particles (vp) per vaccination, either as a single dose or as a two-dose schedule spaced by 56 days in healthy adults (18-55 years old; cohort 1a & 1b; n= 402 and healthy elderly >65 years old; cohort 3; n=394). Vaccine elicited S specific antibody levels were measured by ELISA and neutralizing titers were measured in a wild-type virus neutralization assay (wtVNA). CD4+ T-helper (Th)1 and Th2, and CD8+ immune responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). RESULTS We here report interim analyses after the first dose of blinded safety data from cohorts 1a, 1b and 3 and group unblinded immunogenicity data from cohort 1a and 3. In cohorts 1 and 3 solicited local adverse events were observed in 58% and 27% of participants, respectively. Solicited systemic adverse events were reported in 64% and 36% of participants, respectively. Fevers occurred in both cohorts 1 and 3 in 19% (5% grade 3) and 4% (0% grade 3), respectively, were mostly mild or moderate, and resolved within 1 to 2 days after vaccination. The most frequent local adverse event (AE) was injection site pain and the most frequent solicited AEs were fatigue, headache and myalgia. After only a single dose, seroconversion rate in wtVNA (50% inhibitory concentration - IC50) at day 29 after immunization in cohort 1a already reached 92% with GMTs of 214 (95% CI: 177; 259) and 92% with GMTs of 243 (95% CI: 200; 295) for the 5x1010 and 1x1011vp dose levels, respectively. A similar immunogenicity profile was observed in the first 15 participants in cohort 3, where 100% seroconversion (6/6) (GMTs of 196 [95%CI: 69; 560]) and 83% seroconversion (5/6) (GMTs of 127 [95% CI: <58; 327]) were observed for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively. Seroconversion for S antibodies as measured by ELISA (ELISA Units/mL) was observed in 99% of cohort 1a participants (GMTs of 528 [95% CI: 442; 630) and 695 (95% CI: 596; 810]), for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively, and in 100% (6/6 for both dose levels) of cohort 3 with GMTs of 507 (95% CI: 181; 1418) and 248 (95% CI: 122; 506), respectively. On day 14 post immunization, Th1 cytokine producing S-specific CD4+ T cell responses were measured in 80% and 83% of a subset of participants in cohort 1a and 3, respectively, with no or very low Th2 responses, indicative of a Th1-skewed phenotype in both cohorts. CD8+ T cell responses were also robust in both cohort 1a and 3, for both dose levels. CONCLUSIONS The safety profile and immunogenicity after only a single dose are supportive for further clinical development of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp, as a potentially protective vaccine against COVID-19.

4744,Development and validation of an early warning score (EWAS) for predicting clinical deterioration in patients with coronavirus disease 2019,"BackgroundSince the pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the health system capacity in highly endemic areas has been overwhelmed. Approaches to efficient management are urgently needed. We aimed to develop and validate a score for early prediction of clinical deterioration of COVID-19 patients.

MethodsIn this retrospective multicenter cohort study, we included 1138 mild to moderate COVID-19 patients admitted to 33 hospitals in Guangdong Province from December 27, 2019 to March 4, 2020 (N =818; training cohort), as well as two hospitals in Hubei Province from January 21 to February 22, 2020 (N =320; validation cohort) in the analysis.

ResultsThe 14-day cumulative incidences of clinical deterioration were 7.9% and 12.1% in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. An Early WArning Score (EWAS) (ranging from 0 to 4.5), comprising of age, underlying chronic disease, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer levels, was developed (AUROC: 0.857). By applying the EWAS, patients were categorized into low-, medium-, and high risk groups (cut-off values: two and three). The 14-day cumulative incidence of clinical deterioration in the low-risk group was 1.8%, which was significantly lower than the incidence rates in the medium-(14.4%) and high-risk (40.9%) groups (P <.001). The predictability of EWAS was similar in the validation cohort (AUROC =0.781), patients in the low-, medium-, and high-risk groups had 14-day cumulative incidences of 2.6%, 10.0%, and 25.7%, respectively (P <.001).

ConclusionThe EWAS, which is based on five common parameters, can predict COVID-19-related clinical deterioration and may be a useful tool for a rapid triage and establishing a COVID-19 hierarchical management system that will greatly focus clinical management and medical resources to reduce mortality in highly endemic areas.","Guo, Y.; Liu, Y.; Lu, J.; Fan, R.; Zhang, F.; Yin, X.; Liu, Z.; Zeng, Q.; Yuan, J.; Hu, S.; Wang, Q.; Liao, B.; Huang, M.; Yin, S.; Zhang, X.; Xin, R.; Lin, Z.; Hu, C.; Zhao, B.; He, R.; Liang, M.; Zhang, Z.; Liu, L.; Sun, J.; Tang, L.; Deng, L.; Xia, J.; Tang, X.; Liu, L.; Hou, J.",2020-04-21,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.17.20064691,1,Jinlin Hou,"Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20064691v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20064691v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
14900,Mental health service activity during COVID-19 lockdown among individuals with Personality Disorders: South London and Maudsley data on services and mortality from January to May 2020,"The lockdown and social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a widespread impact on mental healthcare for both services themselves and the people accessing those services. Previous reports from the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in South London) highlighted a shift to virtual contacts among those accessing community mental health and home treatment teams and an increase in deaths over the pandemic first wave. However, there is a need to understand this further for specific groups, including those diagnosed with a personality disorder who might have particular vulnerabilities. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with 24-hourly updates of electronic mental health records data, this paper describes daily caseloads and contact numbers (face-to-face and virtual) for individuals with personality disorders across community, specialist, crisis and inpatient services. The report focussed on the period 1st January to 31st May 2020. We also report on daily accepted and discharged trust referrals, total trust caseloads and daily inpatient admissions and discharges for individuals with personality disorders. In addition, daily deaths are described for all current and previous SLaM service users with personality disorder over this period. In summary, comparing periods before and after 16th March 2020 there was a shift from face-to-face contacts to virtual contacts across all teams. Liaison and Older Adult teams showed the largest drop in caseloads, whereas Early Intervention in Psychosis service caseloads remained the same. Reduced accepted referrals and inpatient admissions were observed and there was a 28% increase in average daily deaths in the period after 16th March, compared to the period 1st January to 15th March.","Nuzum, E.; Martin, E.; Broadbent, M.; Stewart, R.",2020-09-14,Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology,10.1101/2020.09.13.20193730,1,Robert Stewart,King\'s College London,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.13.20193730v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.13.20193730v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

A protocol was implemented on March 20, 2020 using early, short-course, methylprednisolone 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day divided in 2 intravenous doses for 3 days. Outcomes of pre and post-corticosteroid groups were evaluated. A composite endpoint of escalation of care from ward to ICU, new requirement for mechanical ventilation, and mortality was the primary outcome measure. All patients had at least 14 days of follow-up.

ResultsWe analyzed 213 eligible subjects, 81 (38%) and 132 (62%) in pre-and post-corticosteroid groups, respectively. The composite endpoint occurred at a significantly lower rate in post-corticosteroid group compared to pre-corticosteroid group (34.9% vs. 54.3%, p=0.005). This treatment effect was observed within each individual component of the composite endpoint. Significant reduction in median hospital length of stay was observed in the post-corticosteroid group (8 vs. 5 days, p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated an independent reduction in the composite endpoint at 14-days controlling for other factors (aOR: 0.45; 95% CI [0.25 - 0.81]).

ConclusionAn early short course of methylprednisolone in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 reduced escalation of care and improved clinical outcomes.

SummaryIn this multi-center quasi-experimental study of 213 patients, we demonstrate early short course of methylprednisolone in moderate to severe COVID-19 patients reduced the composite endpoint of escalation of care from ward to ICU, new requirement for mechanical ventilation, and mortality.","Fadel, R.; Morrison, A.; Vahia, A.; Smith, Z.

12189,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Real-Time PCR under challenging pre-analytical conditions reveals independence of swab media and cooling chain,"Reliable diagnosis, executed by Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR), builds the current basis in SARS-CoV-2 containment. Transport and storage conditions are the main indicators determining the quality of respiratory specimens. According to shortages in commercially available viral transport media, the primary aim of this study was to explore the reliability of minimal transport media including saline and CDC Viral Transport Media (HBSS VTM) composition for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis by Real-time PCR compared to recommended commercially available standard Universal Transport Media (UTM). This study also implicated the stability of other respiratory viruses, including influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus, providing further evidence for future recommendations on transport and storage of respiratory viruses. Both viral transport media (self-made HBSS VTM and UTM) and saline (0.9% NaCl) allow adequate detection of SARS- CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, regardless of an increase in storage temperature (up to 28 {degrees}C) and time (over 28 days). Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 specimens with varying chlorine concentrations, commonly used in swimming pools, resulted in a significant decrease of viral RNA.

ImportanceDetection of respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2 depends on the quality of respiratory specimens, predominantly determined by transport and storage conditions. Our study revealed the high resilience of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses enabling proper detection in clinical specimens even after long- time storage at high temperatures. This study provides evidence for future recommendations for transport and storage of respiratory viruses, including SARS- CoV-2.

Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-positive respiratory specimens with chlorine indicates an early degradation of the virus after the addition of the oxidant, proposing sufficient inactivation of the virus in swimming pool water.","Summer, S.; Schmidt, R.; Herdina, A.

It is of great significance to study the law of cross-regional spread of the epidemic, for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 in the future in China and other countries or regions. In this study, the cross-regional connection intensity between cities was characterized based on the probability and the effective distance of the shortest path tree, and the empirical analysis was carried out based on the high-frequency data such as the cases of COVID 19 outbreaks. It is concluded that the higher the intensity of inter-city connection, the larger scale the cross-regional spread of the epidemic.","Lin, S.; Qiao, Y.; Huang, J.; Yan, N.",2020-03-30,Health Economics,10.1101/2020.03.27.20044958,1,Yanning Qiao,"School of economics and management, tongji university",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20044958v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20044958v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
10222,Longitudinal immunological analyses reveal inflammatory misfiring in severe COVID-19 patients,"Recent studies have provided insights into the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1-4. Yet, longitudinal immunological correlates of disease outcome remain unclear. Here, we serially analysed immune responses in 113 COVID-19 patients with moderate (non-ICU) and severe (ICU) disease. Immune profiling revealed an overall increase in innate cell lineages with a concomitant reduction in T cell number. We identify an association between early, elevated cytokines and worse disease outcomes. Following an early increase in cytokines, COVID-19 patients with moderate disease displayed a progressive reduction in type-1 (antiviral) and type-3 (antifungal) responses. In contrast, patients with severe disease maintained these elevated responses throughout the course of disease. Moreover, severe disease was accompanied by an increase in multiple type 2 (anti-helminths) effectors including, IL-5, IL-13, IgE and eosinophils. Unsupervised clustering analysis of plasma and peripheral blood leukocyte data identified 4 immune signatures, representing (A) growth factors, (B) type-2/3 cytokines, (C) mixed type-1/2/3 cytokines, and (D) chemokines that correlated with three distinct disease trajectories of patients. The immune profile of patients who recovered with moderate disease was enriched in tissue reparative growth factor signature (A), while the profile for those with worsened disease trajectory had elevated levels of all four signatures. Thus, we identified development of a maladapted immune response profile associated with severe COVID-19 outcome and early immune signatures that correlate with divergent disease trajectories.","Lucas, C.; Wong, P.; Klein, J.; Castro, T.; Silva, J.; Sundaram, M.; Ellingson, M.; Mao, T.; Oh, J.; Israelow, B.; Tokuyama, M.; Lu, P.; Venkataraman, A.; Park, A.; Mohanty, S.; Wang, H.; Wyllie, A.

5754,Performance Characteristics of the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG Assay and Seroprevalence Testing in Idaho,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease-19 (COVID19), the novel respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. The rollout of diagnostic testing in the United States was slow, leading to numerous cases that were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020, necessitating the use of serological testing to determine past infections.

MethodsWe evaluated the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by testing 3 distinct patient populations.

ResultsWe tested 1,020 serum specimens collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the United States and found one false positive, indicating a specificity of 99.90%. We tested 125 patients who tested RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 for which 689 excess serum specimens were available and found sensitivity reached 100% at day 17 after symptom onset and day 13 after PCR positivity. Alternative index value thresholds for positivity resulted in 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in this cohort. We tested 4,856 individuals from Boise, Idaho collected over one week in April 2020 as part of the Crush the Curve initiative and detected 87 positives for a positivity rate of 1.79%.

ConclusionsThese data demonstrate excellent analytical performance of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test as well as the limited circulation of the virus in the western United States. We expect the availability of high-quality serological testing will be a key tool in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.","Bryan, A.; Pepper, G.; Wener, M. H.; Fink, S.

17279,Differences and similarities in diagnostic methods and treatments for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a scoping review,"AimsWe investigate a range of studies related to COVID-19 with focus on scientific evidence reporting the main diagnosis and treatments of the disease.

Main MethodsScoping review conducted in the databases, MEDLINE, Cochrane, Embase, LILACS, Scopus, and Web of Science, and the gray Google Scholar literature, until May 2020. We follow PRISMA-SCR and the recommendations of the Joanna Briggs Institute. The identified studies were independently selected by peers. The qualitative data extracted were synthesized and organized into categories, and the quantitative data were generated through descriptive and inferential statistics.

Key-findings6060 articles were identified, of which 30 were included in this review. The publications are predominantly from China (n=22, 73.3%), and with a type of cross-sectional study (n=12, 40.0%), followed by a cohort (n=7, 23.0%). Among them, 16 studies addressed the diagnosis, and computed tomography was considered as non-invasive complementary method for detecting and evaluating the progression of COVID-19. Laboratory tests have been used to detect enzymatic or viral activities, and to monitor the inflammation associated with COVID-19. 14 studies included different therapeutic associations, such as Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r) and Arbidol, Hydroxychloroquine, Azithromycin, Tocilizumab and Remdesivir, and Corticosteroids/Plasminogen.

SignificanceThe evidence related to diagnostic methods are clear, and include tomography and laboratory tests. Medicinal or associated medications for the treatment of COVID-19, although showing a reduction in signs and COVID-19-related symptoms, can cause adverse effects of mild or severe intensity depending on viral load and inflammatory activity.

5086,Immune defects and cardiovascular risk in X chromosome monosomy mosaicism mediated by loss of chromosome Y. A risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 vulnerability in elderly men?,"The ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19) has an estimated overall case fatality ratio of 1.38% in China, being 53% higher in males and increasing exponentially with age. Mosaicism for X chromosome monosomy (XCM) shows a similar increase in aging population mostly driven by loss of chromosome Y in males (LOY), and is associated with a raise in all-cause mortality. Using comparative transcriptomic data, we have defined that XCM/LOY is associated with abnormal peripheral blood cell counts with decreased progenitor cells and multiple biomarkers of immune system dysfunction, pro-coagulation activity and increased cardiovascular risk. Several differentially down-regulated genes in XCM/LOY individuals are involved in the initial immune response to SARS-CoV-2 (OR of enrichment=7.23, p=1.5x10-7), mainly interferon-induced genes that code for inhibitors of viral processes. Thus, our data suggest that XCM mosaicism underlies at least part of the sex-biased severity and mortality of COVID-19 in aging patients. Given its potential relevance for modulating prognosis and therapeutic response, we propose that evaluation of LOY and XCM by currently established methods should be implemented as biomarkers in infected patients, including currently ongoing clinical trials with different medications and vaccines for COVID-19. Testing for LOY/XCM at large scale among elderly people may also be helpful to identify still unexposed people who may be especially vulnerable to severe Covid-19 disease.","Perez-Jurado, L.

7447,THE ROLE OF POINT-OF-CARE ULTRASONOGRAPHY IN THE INITIAL CHARACTERIZATION OF COVID-19 PATIENTS: RESULTS FROM A PROSPECTIVE MULTICENTRIC STUDY.,"INTRODUCTIONCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious illness caused by the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is growing evidence regarding the imaging findings of COVID-19, in Chest X-ray and CT scan, however their availability in this pandemic outbreak might be compromised. At this moment, the role of Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) has yet to be explored.

OBJECTIVESThe main purpose of this study is to describe the POCUS findings of the disease in COVID-19 patients admitted to the emergency department (ED). Determining the correlation of these parameters with vital signs, laboratory results and chest X-ray, as well as, therapeutic decisions and prognosis.

METHODSProspective study carried out in the emergency department (ED) of two academic hospitals. High suspicion or confirmed COVID-19 patients were subjected to the ultrasonographic measurement of the inferior vena cava (IVC), focused cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS), and Lung Ultrasonography (Lung POCUS).

RESULTSBetween March and April 2020, ninety-six patients were enrolled. The mean age was 68.2 years (SD 17.5). The most common finding in Lung POCUS was an irregular pleural line (63.2%) followed by bilateral confluent (55.2%) and isolated B-lines (53.1%), which was associated with a positive RT-PCR (OR 4.729, 95% CI: 1.989-11.246; p<0.001), and correlated with IL-6 levels (rho = 0.622; p = 0.002). The IVC moderately correlated with levels of pO2, expiratory (rho = -0.539; p = 0.014) and inspiratory (rho = -0.527; p = 0.017), with troponin I (rho = 0.509; p=0.03). After POCUS exam, almost 20% of the patients had an associated condition that required a change in the treatment or management.

CONCLUSIONIn this pandemic era, as the shortage of resources constitutes an undeniable public health threat, POCUS presents the potential to impact in diagnosis, management and prognosis of our confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients.","Tung Chen, Y.; Llamas Fuentes, R.; Rodriguez Fuertes, P.",2020-05-20,Emergency Medicine,10.1101/2020.05.15.20103333,1,Yale Tung Chen,Hospital Universitario La Paz.

13749,Evidence for treatment with estradiol for women with SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundGiven that an individuals age and gender are strongly predictive of COVID-19 outcomes, do such factors imply anything about preferable therapeutic options?

MethodsAn analysis of electronic health records for a large (68,466-case), international COVID-19 cohort, in five-year age strata, revealed age-dependent sex differences. In particular, we surveyed the effects of systemic hormone administration in women. The primary outcome for estradiol therapy was death. Odds Ratios (ORs) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed for 37,086 COVID-19 women in two age groups: pre- (15-49 years) and post-menopausal (>50 years).

ResultsThe incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher in women than men (about +15%) and, in contrast, the fatality rate is higher in men (about +50%). Interestingly, the relationships between these quantities are also linked to age. Pre-adolescent girls had the same risk of infection and fatality rate as boys. Adult premenopausal women had a significantly higher risk of infection than men in the same five-year age stratum (about 16,000 vs. 12,000 cases). This ratio changed again in postmenopausal women, with infection susceptibility converging with men. While fatality rates increased continuously with age for both sexes, at 50 years there was a steeper increase for men. Thus far, these types of intricacies have been largely neglected. Because the hormone 17{beta}-estradiol has a positive effect on expression of the human ACE2 protein--which plays an essential role for SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry--propensity score matching was performed for the womens sub-cohort, comparing users versus non-users of estradiol. This retrospective study of hormone therapy in female COVID-19 patients shows that the fatality risk for women >50 yrs receiving estradiol therapy (user group) is reduced by more than 50%; the OR was 0.33, 95 % CI [0.18, 0.62] and the Hazard Ratio was 0.29, 95% CI[0.11,0.76]. For younger, pre-menopausal women (15-49 yrs), the risk of COVID-19 fatality is the same irrespective of estradiol treatment, probably because of higher endogenous estradiol levels.

ConclusionsAs of this writing, still no effective drug treatment is available for COVID-19; since estradiol shows such a strong improvement regarding fatality in COVID-19, we suggest prospective studies on the potentially more broadly protective roles of this naturally occurring hormone.","Seeland, U.; Coluzzi, F.; Simmaco, M.; Mura, C.; Bourne, P.

Participants completed questionnaires and had up to five serial blood collections. Of 124 enrolled patients, only two (1.6%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on initial blood draw, and no initially seronegative patients developed newly detectable antibodies on subsequent blood draw(s), corresponding to a seroconversion rate of 0% (95%CI 0.0-4.1%) over 14.8 person-years of follow up, with a median of 13 healthcare visits per patient. These results suggest that cancer patients receiving in-person care at a facility with aggressive mitigation efforts have an extremely low likelihood of COVID-19 infection.","Sun, L.; Surya, S.; G., N.; Le, A.

13342,The cost-effectiveness of common strategies for the prevention of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in universities.,"BackgroundThe added value of interventions to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among university affiliates is uncertain.

MethodsWe use Monte Carlo simulations to examine the cost-effectiveness of seven interventions to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission within universities relative to implementing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines alone. We examine the incremental cost per incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. We provide an online interface for our model so that input parameters can be tailored to local conditions.

ResultsWhen there are 100 infectious cases per 100,000 people in the community (0.1%), the university will likely remain open for the entire semester. At this prevalence rate, using a symptom-checking mobile application is cost-saving relative to CDC guidelines alone. If the community active infectious case rate reaches 1%, the university will likely close after 36 days. At this prevalence rate, providing high quality, 2-ply masks will be cost-saving. As the community prevalence rate of infectious cases reaches 2%, the university can be expected to close after 18 days. At this prevalence rate, thermal imaging cameras cost $965,070 (95% credible interval [CrI] = $198,821, $2.15 million)/QALY gained. One-time testing on entry costs $1.08 million (95% CrI = $170,703, $3.33 million)/QALY gained. Weekly testing costs $820,119 (95% CrI = $452,673, $1.68 million)/QALY gained. Upgrades to ventilation systems or installation of far-ultraviolet C lighting systems will be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $200,000/QALY gained if aerosols account for 86-90% of all on-campus transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

ConclusionsThe value of interventions to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the time that a university can expect to remain open vary greatly with the rate of actively infectious cases of COVID-19 in the community surrounding the university.","Zafari, Z.; Korvizhkin, K.; Goldman, L.; Muennig, P.",2020-09-16,Health Policy,10.1101/2020.08.13.20166975,3,Zafar Zafari,University of Maryland,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20166975v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20166975v3.full.pdf,cc_by,NA

ResultsBetween 22nd April to 14th July 2020, 464 participants were enrolled; 235 and 229 in intervention and control arm, respectively. Composite primary outcome was achieved in 44 (18.7%) participants in the intervention arm and 41 (17.9%) in the control arm [aOR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.77]. Mortality was documented in 34 (13.6%) and 31 (14.6%) participants in intervention and control arm, respectively [aOR) 1.06 95% CI: -0.61 to 1.83].

InterpretationCP was not associated with reduction in mortality or progression to severe COVID-19. This trial has high generalizability and approximates real-life setting of CP therapy in settings with limited laboratory capacity. A priori measurement of neutralizing antibody titres in donors and participants may further clarify the role of CP in management of COVID-19.

Trial registrationThe trial was registered with Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI); CTRI/2020/04/024775.","Agarwal, A.; Mukherjee, A.; Kumar, G.; Chatterjee, P.; Bhatnagar, T.; Malhotra, P.; Latha, B.; Bundas, S.; Kumar, V.; Dosi, R.; Khambholja, J.

15269,"Knowledge, attitudes and practices of COVID 19 among Medical Laboratory Professionals in Zambia","Background: COVID-19 is a novel disease that has spread to nearly every country worldwide. Medical laboratory professionals are key in the fight against COVID-19 as they provide confirmatory diagnosis which is the main basis upon which cases are identified and clinical management instituted. Lack of knowledge, poor attitude and unsafe laboratory practices could have negative implications towards the control of COVID-19. We conducted a quick online questionnaire to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and practices of medical laboratory personnel regarding COVID-19 in Zambia. Methods: We conducted a cross sectional study among medical laboratory professionals in Zambia from 10th to 29th June, 2020. Data were collected using google forms and exported to SPSS version 23 for statistical analysis. Independent predictors of COVID-19 knowledge and practices were determined. Adjusted odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals are reported. Results: A total of 208 medical laboratory professionals participated in the study. There were more males (58.2%) than females. The majority of respondents had good knowledge (84.1%) and practice (75%) regarding COVID-19. Less than half (n=97, 46.6%) reported willingness to participate in a vaccination program. Predictors of good knowledge included; having a Bachelors degree (AOR: 5.0, CI: 1.15-23.9) and having prior COVID-19 related training (AOR: 8.83, CI: 2.03-38.4). Predictors of good practice included; having a masters or PhD qualification (AOR: 5.23, CI: 1.15-23.9) and having prior COVID-19 related training (AOR: 14.01, CI: 6.47-30.4). Conclusion: Our findings revealed that medical laboratory professionals in Zambia have good knowledge and positive attitude towards COVID-19. However poor practices were observed There is need for continuous professional development (CPD) to ensure that medical laboratory professionals are well informed and aware of best practices to aid in curbing the pandemic.

Given the need for mask reuse, we tested the feasibility of vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), ultraviolet light (UV), and ethanol decontamination strategies on N95 mask integrity and the ability to remove the infectious potential of SARS-CoV-2. FIT test data showed functional degradation by both ethanol and UV decontamination to different degrees. VHP treated masks showed no significant change in function after two treatments. We also report a single SARS-CoV-2 virucidal experiment using Vero E6 cell infection.

2487,Lessons drawn from China and South Korea for managing COVID-19 epidemic: insights from a comparative modeling study,"We conducted a comparative study of COVID-19 epidemic in three different settings: mainland China, the Guangdong province of China and South Korea, by formulating two disease transmission dynamics models incorporating epidemic characteristics and setting-specific interventions, and fitting the models to multi-source data to identify initial and effective reproduction numbers and evaluate effectiveness of interventions. We estimated the initial basic reproduction number for South Korea, the Guangdong province and mainland China as 2.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): (2.5, 2.7)), 3.0 (95%CI: (2.6, 3.3)) and 3.8 (95%CI: (3.5,4.2)), respectively, given a serial interval with mean of 5 days with standard deviation of 3 days. We found that the effective reproduction number for the Guangdong province and mainland China has fallen below the threshold 1 since February 8th and 18th respectively, while the effective reproduction number for South Korea remains high, suggesting that the interventions implemented need to be enhanced in order to halt further infections. We also project the epidemic trend in South Korea under different scenarios where a portion or the entirety of the integrated package of interventions in China is used. We show that a coherent and integrated approach with stringent public health interventions is the key to the success of containing the epidemic in China and specially its provinces outside its epicenter, and we show that this approach can also be effective to mitigate the burden of the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea. The experience of outbreak control in mainland China should be a guiding reference for the rest of the world including South Korea.","Tang, B.; Xia, F.; Bragazzi, N.

It has been proposed that a subset of mild or asymptomatic cases with undetectable antibodies may clear the virus in a T-cell cytotoxic-dependent manner, albeit recent data revealed the importance of B-cells in that regard. We hypothesized that underdiagnosed antigenemia/viremia may conceal humoral response possibly through immunocomplex formation. We report the first case of late-onset seroconversion detected following decline in antigenemia/viremia levels. Consequently, classification of at least a subset of COVID-19 cases as non-responders might not represent a true immunobiological phenomenon, rather reflect antibody masking due to prolonged antigenemia/viremia.","Gorgoulis, V.

1878,Reduction and Functional Exhaustion of T Cells in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),"BACKGROUNDThe outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed great threat to human health, which has been declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the WHO. T cells play a critical role in antiviral immunity but their numbers and functional state in COVID-19 patients remain largely unclear.

METHODSWe retrospectively reviewed the counts of total T cells, CD4+, CD8+ T cell subsets, and serum cytokine concentration from inpatient data of 522 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, admitted into two hospitals in Wuhan from December 2019 to January 2020, and 40 healthy controls, who came to the hospitals for routine physical examination. In addition, the expression of T cell exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 were measured by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood of 14 COVID-19 cases.

RESULTSThe number of total T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients, especially among elderly patients ([&gt;=]60 years of age) and in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care. Counts of total T cells, CD8+T cells or CD4+T cells lower than 800/L, 300/L, or 400/L, respectively, are negatively correlated with patient survival. Statistical analysis demonstrated that T cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10 and TNF- concentration, with patients in decline period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10 and TNF- concentrations and restored T cell counts. Finally, T cells from COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker PD-1 as compared to health controls. Moreover, increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells could be seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages, further indicative of T cell exhaustion.

CONCLUSIONST cell counts are reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients, and the surviving T cells appear functionally exhausted. Non-ICU patients, with total T cells, CD8+T cells CD4+T cells counts lower than 800/L, 300/L, and 400/L, respectively, may still require aggressive intervention even in the immediate absence of more severe symptoms due to a high risk for further deterioration in condition.","Diao, B.; Wang, C.; Tan, Y.; Chen, X.; Liu, Y.; Ning, L.; Chen, L.; Li, M.; Liu, Y.; Wang, G.; Yuan, Z.; Feng, Z.; Wu, Y.; Chen, Y.",2020-02-20,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.02.18.20024364,1,Yongwen Chen,"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024364v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024364v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3389/fimmu.2020.00827
9907,A high-throughput strategy for COVID-19 testing based on next-generation sequencing,"COVID-19 testing as sufficient as needed is essential for healthcare workers, patients, and authorities to make informed decisions to confront and eventually defeat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, diagnosis of COVID-19 relies on quantitative reverse-transcription PCR, which is low-throughput, laborious, and often false-negative, making it overwhelmingly challenging to meet testing needs even in industrialized countries. Here we propose a new strategy, which employs a modified loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, a simple procedure requiring no sophisticated instruments, to index and amplify viral genes from individual specimens, of which the products are readily available for construction of multiplexed libraries for next-generation sequencing. Our strategy would allow precise diagnosis of thousands of specimens in 1-2 days with significantly lower operating expenses. Furthermore, this strategy will make it possible for patients to collect, process, and mail their own samples to facilities for a quick, reliable diagnosis at a population scale.","Huang, J.; Zhao, L.",2020-06-19,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.12.20129718,1,Jian Huang,Rush University Medical Center,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.20129718v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.20129718v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
17483,Household Transmission of SARS-COV-2: Insights from a Population-based Serological Survey,"BackgroundKnowing the transmissibility of asymptomatic infections and risk of infection from household- and community-exposures is critical to SARS-CoV-2 control. Limited previous evidence is based primarily on virologic testing, which disproportionately misses mild and asymptomatic infections. Serologic measures are more likely to capture all previously infected individuals.

ObjectiveEstimate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection from household and community exposures, and identify key risk factors for transmission and infection.

DesignCross-sectional household serosurvey and transmission model.

SettingGeneva, Switzerland

Participants4,524 household members [&ge;]5 years from 2,267 households enrolled April-June 2020.

MeasurementsPast SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed through IgG ELISA. Chain-binomial models based on the number of infections within households used to estimate the cumulative extra-household infection risk and infection risk from exposure to an infected household member by demographics and infectors symptoms.

ResultsThe chance of being infected by a SARS-CoV-2 infected household member was 17.3% (95%CrI,13.7-21.7%) compared to a cumulative extra-household infection risk of 5.1% (95%CrI,4.5-5.8%). Infection risk from an infected household member increased with age, with 5-9 year olds having 0.4 times (95%CrI, 0.07-1.4) the odds of infection, and [&ge;]65 years olds having 2.7 (95%CrI,0.88-7.4) times the odds of infection of 20-49 year olds. Working-age adults had the highest extra-household infection risk. Seropositive asymptomatic household members had 69.6% lower odds (95%CrI,33.7-88.1%) of infecting another household member compared to those reporting symptoms, accounting for 14.7% (95%CrI,6.3-23.2%) of all household infections.

LimitationsSelf-reported symptoms, small number of seropositive kids and imperfect serologic tests.

ConclusionThe risk of infection from exposure to a single infected household member was more than three-times that of extra-household exposures over the first pandemic wave. Young children had a lower risk of infection from household members. Asymptomatic infections are far less likely to transmit than symptomatic ones but do cause infections.

19411,Sub-national forecasts of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across the UK: a large-scale cross-sectional spatial modelling study,"IntroductionThere is evidence of decreasing uptake of routine immunisations in the UK in recent years. As the United Kingdom begins a mass vaccination campaign with a novel COVID-19 vaccine, it is unclear whether refusal of the vaccine in some regions and among some socio-economic groups will pose challenges for achieving herd/community immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsThis study estimates uptake of a COVID-19 at unprecedented spatial resolution across the UK using a large-scale survey and state-of-the-art Bayesian statistical methods for estimating public opinion. Between 24 September and 14 October 2020, 17,684 individuals are surveyed in a cross-sectional online survey design. Regions and socio-economic groups who may be more resistant towards a new vaccine are identified using multilevel regression and poststratification. Gibbs sampling is used for Bayesian model inference, with uncertainty in parameter estimates captured via 95% highest posterior density intervals.

FindingsThis study predicts that clusters of non-vaccinators will likely emerge in many regions across the UK, most notably in London (which has 13 of the 20 lowest ranking regions) and the North West (which has four, including Greater Manchester and Liverpool). Males are much more likely to state intent to accept the vaccine than females (OR 1{middle dot}59, 1{middle dot}47 to 1{middle dot}73); while Muslims are less likely than atheists / agnostics (0{middle dot}75, 0{middle dot}57 to 0{middle dot}96), Black / Black British are less likely than Whites (0{middle dot}47, 0{middle dot}38 to 0{middle dot}60), and Polish speakers (0{middle dot}45, 0{middle dot}31 to 0{middle dot}63) are less likely than those who primarily speak English or Welsh. Across the UK, 8{middle dot}7% (8{middle dot}2 to 9{middle dot}2%) state that they would ""definitely not"" accept a vaccine, but less than half (47{middle dot}5%, 46{middle dot}5 to 48{middle dot}5%) say they would ""definitely"" accept a COVID-19 vaccine, with a substantial proportion unsure.

InterpretationThe study findings are extremely important in the context of achieving herd/community immunity. Low predicted acceptance rates in parts of London and the North West are of particular concern as many of these regions have among the highest rates of COVID-19 infection across the UK: low vaccine uptake in these regions may result in disease ""hotspots"" that amplify the spread of the disease and require increases in vaccination levels in adjacent regions to provide nationwide herd/community immunity. It is therefore extremely important to identify such regions, and to engage with communities within them in advance of vaccination rollout to the population at large. Encouragingly, intent to accept a COVID-19 vaccine is higher among older age-groups, who are among the first to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

13577,COVID-19: Exhaled virus detected by Face Mask Sampling provides new links to disease severity and potential infectivity.,"BackgroundNasopharyngeal samples (NPS) are the mainstay of COVID-19 diagnosis. However, the extent to which assay signals relate to exhaled virus is unknown. We investigated the use of novel, non-invasive face-mask sampling (FMS) to detect exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA in two studies.

MethodsIn an outbreak study (cohort 1), we performed FMS and NPS for 21 consecutive days after diagnosis on six healthcare workers who were screened positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a second hospitalised cohort (cohort 2), we performed FMS on 47 patients within 24 hours of a positive diagnosis. COVID-19 severity was graded according to WHO recommendations.

FindingsIn cohort 1, SARS-COV-2 was detected by FMS in 10/40 (25%) samples (4/6 individuals), with no correlation between NPS and FMS RNA signals. All samples were negative by day 14 post diagnosis. Sustained FMS positivity with higher viral RNA signals showed a trend towards disease severity.

In cohort 2, 19/47 (40%) individuals exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA extending over five orders of magnitude. FMS positive participants were older (positive: median age [IQR] 71 [61-84] vs negative: 61 [45-73], p = 0.04) with more comorbidities (positive: 2 [1-3] vs negative: 1 [0-2], p< 0.001) and have active cough (positive: 68% vs negative: 24%, p = 0.003) and breathlessness (positive: 74% vs negative: 32%, p = 0.005) during sampling, compared to FMS negative patients. Of five patients who were FMS positive and asymptomatic at time of sampling, two died of severe COVID-19 pneumonia within one month of follow up.

InterpretationFMS detects exhaled SARS-COV-2, with stronger signals in those who develop severe disease.","Williams, C.; Pan, D.; Decker, J.; Wisniewska, A.; Sze, S.; Fletcher, E.; Haigh, R.; Abdulwhhab, M.; Bird, P.; Holmes, C.; Al-Taie, A.; Saleem, B.; Pan, J.; Garton, N.; Pareek, M.; Barer, M.",2020-08-21,Respiratory Medicine,10.1101/2020.08.18.20176693,1,Caroline Williams,University of Leicester,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20176693v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20176693v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

7805,Clinical and molecular characterization of COVID-19 hospitalized patients,"Clinical and molecular characterization by Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) is reported in 35 COVID-19 patients attending the University Hospital in Siena, Italy, from April 7 to May 7, 2020. Eighty percent of patients required respiratory assistance, half of them being on mechanical ventilation. Fiftyone percent had hepatic involvement and hyposmia was ascertained in 3 patients. Searching for common genes by collapsing methods against 150 WES of controls of the Italian population failed to give straightforward statistically significant results with the exception of two genes. This result is not unexpected since we are facing the most challenging common disorder triggered by environmental factors with a strong underlying heritability (50%). The lesson learned from Autism-Spectrum-Disorders prompted us to re-analyse the cohort treating each patient as an independent case, following a Mendelian-like model. We identified for each patient an average of 2.5 pathogenic mutations involved in virus infection susceptibility and pinpointing to one or more rare disorder(s). To our knowledge, this is the first report on WES and COVID-19.

The total confirmed number of cases in Makkah was 10,709 with 127 deaths as of May 16, 2020.

Aims of the studyForecasting the COVID-19 progression in the city of Makkah will help the policymakers decide if the Hajj will be able to operate this year. Thus, to see a clear picture of the fight against COVID-19 for the economy and healthcare industry in Saudi Arabia, specifically in Makkah, the SIR model will predict COVID-19 progression in the city of Makkah.

MethodThe Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered (SIR) model has been used to track the transmission dynamics and growth among the city of Makkah. The growth index was calculated, according to the data from March 16 until May 9. The estimated vital epidemiological parameters, such as forecasting works and transmission rates, were done.

ResultThe data showed an interesting result about the peak of the disease progression. It is projected to occur around the 12th day after running the model. According to the model, the peak time will be around the 22nd of May. Then, the number of cases will start to decrease.

ConclusionUsing the SIR model, the result predicts the disease progression peak and an estimated end of COVID-19 in the city of Makkah to help the policymakers decide if the Hajj will be able to operate this year.","Mujallad, A.

6605,Immunity Passports for SARS-CoV-2: an online experimental study of the impact of antibody test terminology on perceived risk and behaviour,"WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LITest results indicating the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are often referred to as Immunity Passports or Certificates.
C_LIO_LIDue to the limitations of such tests, including uncertainty about the duration of immunity conferred by detected antibodies, those receiving results indicating the presence of antibodies retain a risk of becoming infected by SARS-CoV-2.
C_LIO_LIIt is unknown whether the use of the terms Immunity Passports or Certificates reduces awareness of the residual risk inherent in an antibody-positive test result and adherence to protective behaviours, thereby increasing risk of transmission.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSO_LIUsing the term Immunity - as opposed to Antibody - to describe antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 more than doubled the proportion who erroneously perceived they would have no risk of catching coronavirus in the future given an antibody-positive test result, from 9.8% for Antibody to 19.1% for Immunity.
C_LIO_LIPerceiving no risk of infection with coronavirus given an antibody-positive test result was associated with an intention to wash hands less frequently.
C_LIO_LIUsing the terms Passport, Certificate or Test had no significant effect.
C_LI

ObjectiveTo assess the impact of describing an antibody-positive test result using the terms Immunity and Passport or Certificate, alone or in combination, on perceived risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 and intention to continue protective behaviours.

Design2 x 3 experimental design.

SettingOnline with data collected between 28th April and 1st May 2020.

Participants1,204 adults registered with a UK research panel.

InterventionParticipants were randomised to receive one of six descriptions of an antibody test and results showing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, differing in the terms used to describe the type of test (Immunity vs Antibody) and the test result (Passport vs Certificate vs Test).

Main outcome measuresThe primary outcome was the proportion of participants perceiving no risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 given an antibody positive test result. Other outcomes include intended changes to frequency of handwashing and physical distancing.

ResultsWhen using the term Immunity (vs Antibody), 19.1% of participants [95% CI: 16.1 to 22.5] (vs 9.8% [95% CI: 7.5 to 12.4]) perceived no risk of catching coronavirus at some point in the future given an antibody-positive test result (AOR: 2.91 [95% CI: 1.52 to 5.55]). Using the terms Passport or Certificate - as opposed to Test - had no significant effect (AOR: 1.24 [95% CI: 0.62 to 2.48] and AOR: 0.96 [95% CI: 0.47 to 1.99] respectively). There was no significant interaction between the effects of the test and result terminology. Across groups, perceiving no risk of infection was associated with an intention to wash hands less frequently (AOR: 2.32 [95% CI: 1.25 to 4.28]) but there was no significant association with intended avoidance of physical contact with others outside of the home (AOR: 1.37 [95% CI: 0.93-2.03]).

ConclusionsUsing the term Immunity (vs Antibody) to describe antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 increases the proportion of people believing that an antibody-positive result means they have no risk of catching coronavirus in the future, a perception that may be associated with less frequent handwashing. The way antibody testing is described may have implications for the likely impact of testing on transmission rates.

19007,Credible learning of hydroxychloroquine and dexamethasone effects on COVID-19 mortality outside of randomized trials,"ObjectivesTo investigate the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and dexamethasone on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) mortality using patient data outside of randomized trials.

DesignPhenotypes derived from electronic health records were analyzed using the stability-controlled quasi-experiment (SCQE) to provide a range of possible causal effects of hydroxy-chloroquine and dexamethasone on COVID-19 mortality.

Setting and participantsData from 2,007 COVID-19 positive patients hospitalized at a large university hospital system over the course of 200 days and not enrolled in randomized trials were analyzed using SCQE. For hyrdoxychloroquine, we examine a high-use cohort (n=766, days 1 to 43) and a later, low-use cohort (n=548, days 44 to 82). For dexamethasone, we examine a low-use cohort (n=614, days 44 to 101) and high-use cohort (n=622, days 102 to 200).

Outcome measure14-day mortality, with a secondary outcome of 28-day mortality.

ResultsHydroxycholoroquine could only have been significantly (p<0.05) beneficial if baseline mortality was at least 6.4 percentage points (55%) lower among patients in the later (low-use) than the earlier (high-use) cohort. Hydroxychloroquine instead proves significantly harmful if baseline mortality rose from one cohort to the next by just 0.3 percentage points. Dexamethasone significantly reduced mortality risk if baseline mortality in the later (high-use) cohort (days 102-200) was higher than, the same as, or up to 1.5 percentage points lower than that in the earlier (low-use) cohort (days 44-101). It could only prove significantly harmful if mortality improved from one cohort to the next by 6.8 percentage points due to other causes--an assumption implying an unlikely 84% reduction in mortality due to other causes, leaving an in-hospital mortality rate of just 1.3%.

ConclusionsThe assumptions required for a beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine on 14 day mortality are difficult to sustain, while the assumptions required for hydroxychloroquine to be harmful are difficult to reject with confidence. Dexamethasone, by contrast, was beneficial under a wide range of plausible assumptions, and was only harmful if a nearly impossible assumption is met. More broadly, the SCQE reveals what inferences can be credibly supported by evidence from non-randomized uses of experimental therapies, making it a useful tool when randomized trials have not yet produced clear evidence or to provide corroborative evidence from different populations.","Hazlett, C.; Wulf, D.

13507,Impacts on Surgery Resident Education at a first wave COVID-19 epicenter,"BackgroundThis study aims to identify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical resident training and education at Danbury Hospital.

MethodsWe conducted an observational study at a Western Connecticut hospital heavily affected by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its effects on surgical residents, focusing on surgical education, clinical experience, and operative skills development. Objective data was available through recorded work hours, case logs, and formal didactics. In addition, we created an anonymous survey to assess resident perception of their residency experience during the pandemic.

ResultsThere are 22 surgical residents at our institution; all were included in the study. Resident weekly duty hours decreased by 23.9 hours with the majority of clinical time redirected to caring for COVID-19 patients. Independent studying increased by 1.6 hours (26.2%) while weekly didactics decreased by 2.1 hours (35.6%). The operative volume per resident decreased by 65.7% from 35.0 to 12.0 cases for the period of interest, with a disproportionately high effect on junior residents, who experienced a 76.2% decrease. Unsurprisingly, 70% of residents reported a negative effect of the pandemic on their surgical skills.

ConclusionsDuring the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical residents usual workflows changed dramatically, as much of their time was dedicated to the critical care of patients with COVID-19. However, the consequent opportunity cost was to surgery-specific training; there was a significant decrease in operative cases and time spent in surgical didactics, along with elevated concern about overall preparedness for their intended career.","Ostapenko, A.; Mcpeck, S.; Liechty, S.; Kleiner, D.",2020-08-18,Surgery,10.1101/2020.08.16.20176073,1,Alexander Ostapenko,Danbury Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20176073v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20176073v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1177/2382120520975022

8677,Syncope at SARS-CoV-2 onset due to impaired baroreflex response,"We describe clinical and laboratory findings in 35 consecutive patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal swab that presented one or multiple syncopal events at disease onset. Neurological examination and electrocardiographic findings were normal. Chest computed tomography showed findings consistent with interstitial pneumonia. Arterial blood gas analysis showed low pO2, pCO2, and P/F ratio indicating hypocapnic hypoxemia, while patients did not show the expected compensatory heart rate increase. Such mechanism could have led to syncope. We speculate that SARS-CoV-2 could have caused angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor internalization in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), thus altering the baroreflex response and inhibiting the compensatory tachycardia during acute hypocapnic hypoxemia.","Canetta, C.; Accordino, S.; Buscarini, E.; Benelli, G.; La Piana, G.; Scartabellati, A.; Vigano', G.; Assandri, R.; Astengo, A.; Benzoni, C.; Gaudiano, G.; Cazzato, D.; Rossi, S.

19026,Integrative analyses identify susceptibility genes underlying COVID-19 hospitalization,"Despite rapid progress in characterizing the role of host genetics in SARS-Cov-2 infection, there is limited understanding of genes and pathways that contribute to COVID-19. Here, we integrated a genome-wide association study of COVID-19 hospitalization (7,885 cases and 961,804 controls from COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative) with mRNA expression, splicing, and protein levels (n=18,502). We identified 27 genes related to inflammation and coagulation pathways whose genetically predicted expression was associated with COVID-19 hospitalization. We functionally characterized the 27 genes using phenome- and laboratory-wide association scans in Vanderbilt Biobank (BioVU; n=85,460) and identified coagulation-related clinical symptoms, immunologic, and blood-cell-related biomarkers. We replicated these findings across trans-ethnic studies and observed consistent effects in individuals of diverse ancestral backgrounds in BioVU, pan-UK Biobank, and Biobank Japan. Our study highlights putative causal genes impacting COVID-19 severity and symptomology through the host inflammatory response.

6957,Health literacy of inland population in the mitigation phase 3.2. of COVID-19's pandemic in Portugal - a descriptive cohort study,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is a respiratory disease transmitted through respiratory droplets with a high transmission rate. Theres still no effective and approved antiretroviral treatment or vaccine, thus, preventive measures are the main key to contain this pandemic. Portugal is now in phase 3.2 of the mitigation of COVID-19, being imperative to understand the health literacy of our country and how to prevent the lack of information, through community empowerment.

Material and methodsA cross-sectional study with a cohort from a primary care facility was conducted. We collected demographic and epidemiological data and carried out a questionnaire by phone call. Descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests were used to assess associations between the independent variables and the level of health literacy. The level of significance was set at p<0.05.

ResultsOur cohort includes 222 subjects (median age: 62 years old), mostly females (131), undergraduate (193) and with at least one risk factor for COVID-19 (144). Globally, younger individuals, females, graduates and the Non-Risk Group appear to have higher levels of health literacy, with some exceptions to this pattern.

ConclusionsWe observe a well-informed population. However, being a pandemic situation, we intend to identify and correct outliers/misconceptions. This work allows a perspective of the current state/pattern of health literacy as well as its possible predictors. Furthermore, this study makes aware of how relevant the specific communication approaches are. Further studies to understand the predictors of health literacy are necessary.","Gomes Da Silva, J.; Sofia Silva, C.; Alexandre, B.; Morgado, P.",2020-05-14,Primary Care Research,10.1101/2020.05.11.20098061,1,Joana Gomes Da Silva,Centro de Saude Mirandela II,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.20098061v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.20098061v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

Here, we applied genomic epidemiology to investigate the origins of this outbreak. We enrolled two individuals with exposures linked to the White House COVID-19 outbreak into an IRB-approved research study and sequenced their SARS-CoV-2 infections. We find these viral sequences are identical to each other, but are distinct from over 190,000 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These genomes fall as part of a lineage circulating in the USA since April or May 2020 and detected in Virginia and Michigan. Looking forwards, sequencing of additional community SARS-CoV-2 infections collected in the USA prior to October 2020 may shed further light on its geographic ancestry. In sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 infections collected after October 2020, it may be possible to identify infections that likely descend from the White House COVID-19 outbreak.","Bedford, T.; Logue, J.

Health systems, including Primary Health Care (PHC) services, are pillars of pandemic coping strategies, and there are important gaps in the literature on the best ways to organize PHC in health crisis scenarios such as the one currently experienced. Given the urgency of responses, we performed a rapid systematic literature review on MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE and LILACS (via VHL), in order to analyze empirical studies on the effectiveness of PHC organization strategies in the context of epidemics to improve access and reduce morbidity and mortality. We selected seven articles, which studied the responses to different epidemics in different parts of the world. In terms of access, the studies suggest positive results with the adoption of adjustments of work processes of the teams and the structure of the services, combined with diversification of actions (including call center), adequate provision of inputs and personal protective equipment, adequate action plans and communication strategies, and effective integration with public health services and other levels of care. No study analyzed population morbidity and mortality. The included studies suggest also that community-oriented PHC is more effective in crisis scenarios, indicating the necessity of strengthening of the Family Health Strategy in the Brazilian context.","Sarti, T.

16981,COVIDTrach; a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy in the UK,"PurposeCOVIDTrach is a UK multi-centre prospective cohort study project evaluating the outcomes of tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 receiving mechanical ventilation. It also examines the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers involved in the procedure.

MethodAn invitation to participate was sent to all UK NHS departments involved in tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients. Data was entered prospectively and clinical outcomes updated via an online database (REDCap). Clinical variables were compared with outcomes using multivariable regression analysis, with logistic regression used to develop a prediction model for mortality. Participants recorded whether any operators tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within two weeks of the procedure.

ResultsThe cohort comprised 1605 tracheostomy cases from 126 UK hospitals. The median time from intubation to tracheostomy was 15 days (IQR 11, 21). 285 (18%) patients died following the procedure. 1229 (93%) of the survivors had been successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation at censoring and 1049 (81%) had been discharged from hospital. Age, inspired oxygen concentration, PEEP setting, pyrexia, number of days of ventilation before tracheostomy, C-reactive protein and the use of anticoagulation and inotropic support independently predicted mortality. Six reports were received of operators testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 within two weeks of the procedure.

ConclusionsTracheostomy appears to be safe in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 and to operators performing the procedure and we identified clinical indicators that are predictive of mortality.

3085,A demographic adjustment to improve measurement of COVID-19 severity at the developing stage of the pandemic,"The need for accurate statistics has never been felt so deeply as the novel COVID-19 pathogen spreads around the world and quantifying its severity is a primary clinical and public health issue. In Italy, the magnitude and increasing trend of the case-fatality risk (CFR) is fueling the already high levels of public alarm. In this paper, we highlight that the widely used crude CFR is an inaccurate measure of the disease severity since the pandemic is still unfolding. With the goal to improve its comparability over time and across countries at this stage, we then propose a demographic adjustment of the CFR that addresses the bias arising from differential case ascertainment by age. When applied to publicly released data for Italy, we show that until March 16 our adjusted CFR was similar to that of Wuhan - the most affected Chinese region, where COVID-19 has now been contained. This indicates that our adjusted CFR improves its comparability over time, making an important tool to chart the course of the COVID-19 pandemic across countries. Since March 16, the Italian COVID-19 outbreak has entered a new phase, with the northern and southern regions following different trajectories. As a result, our adjusted CFR has been increasing between March 16 and March 20. Data at the subnational level are needed to correctly assess the disease severity in the country at this stage.","Bignami, S.; Ghio, D.",2020-03-27,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.23.20040998,1,Simona Bignami,Universite de Montreal,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20040998v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20040998v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
15068,Parents' and guardians' views on the acceptability of a future Covid-19 vaccine: a multi-methods study in England,"Background: The availability of a COVID-19 vaccine has been heralded as key to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 vaccination programme success will rely on public willingness to be vaccinated. Methods: We used a multi-methods approach - involving an online cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interviews - to investigate parents' and guardians' views on the acceptability of a future COVID-19 vaccine. 1252 parents and guardians (aged 16+ years) who reported living in England with a child aged 18 months or under completed the survey. Nineteen survey respondents were interviewed. Findings: Most participants reported they would definitely accept or were unsure but leaning towards accepting a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves (Definitely 55.8%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 34.3%) and their child/children (Definitely 48.2%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 40.9%). Less than 4% of participants reported that they would definitely not accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves or their child/children. Participants were more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves than for their child/children. Participants that self-reported as Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity were almost 3 times more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children than White British, White Irish and White Other participants. Respondents from lower income households were also more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine. The main reason for vaccine acceptance was for self-protection from COVID-19. Common concerns were around COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness, which were largely prompted by the newness and rapid development of the vaccine. Conclusion: To alleviate concerns, information on how COVID-19 vaccines are developed and tested, including their safety and efficacy, must be communicated clearly to the public.

2725,PREDICTING THE EVOLUTION OF COVID-19 IN PORTUGAL USING AN ADAPTED SIR MODEL PREVIOUSLY USED IN SOUTH KOREA FOR THE MERS OUTBREAK,"The covid-19 has spread very quickly worldwide, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a state of pandemic. Moreover, the WHO has announced that the European continent is now the main centre of the pandemic.

One of the questions many governments are asking is how the spread is going to evolve in time. In this study, an adapted SIR model previously used in South Korea to model the MERS outbreak was applied to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases in the case of the Portuguese situation. As some of the parameters were unknown, and the data for Portugal is still scarce, given that the outbreak started later (first case on the 2nd of March) I used Italian data (first reported case in Italy on the 31st of January) to predict them. I then construct five different scenarios for the evolution of covid-19 in Portugal, considering both the effectiveness of the mitigation measurements implemented by the government, and the self-protective measures taken by the population, as explained in the South Korean model.

In the out of control scenario, the number of active cases could reach as much as 40,000 people by the beginning of April. In the best-case-scenario considered, the active cases could reach circa 7,000 people. The actual figure probably lies between the interval (7,000-13,000) and the peak will be reached between 9th and the 20th of April 2020.

Without control and self-protective measures, this model predicts that the figures of active cases of SARS-covid-2 would reach a staggering 40,000 people It shows the importance of control and self-protecting measure to bring down the number of affected people by following the recommendations of the WHO and health authorities. With the appropriate measures, this number can be brought down to 7,000-13,000 people","Teles, P.",2020-04-15,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.18.20038612,3,Pedro Teles,Faculdade de Ciencias da Universidade do Porto,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.18.20038612v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.18.20038612v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
7958,Containing the Spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Meteorological Factors and Control Strategies,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally and the meteorological factors vary greatly across the world. Understanding the effect of meteorological factors and control strategies on COVID-19 transmission is critical to contain the epidemic. Using individual-level data in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore, and the number of confirmed cases in other regions, we explore the effect of temperature, relative humidity, and control measures on the spread of COVID-19. We found that high temperature mitigates the transmission of the disease. High relative humidity promotes COVID-19 transmission when temperature is low, but tends to reduce transmission when temperature is high. Implementing classical control measures can dramatically slow the spread of the disease. However, due to the occurrence of pre-symptomatic infections, the effect of the measures to shorten onset-to-isolation time is markedly reduced and the importance of contact tracing and quarantine and social distancing increases. The analytic results also highlight the importance of early intervention to contain the spread of COVID-19.","Lin, J.; Huang, W.; Wen, M.; Ma, S.; Hua, J.; Hu, H.; Li, D.; Yin, S.; Qian, Y.; Chen, P.; Zhang, Q.; Yuan, N.; Sun, S.",2020-05-26,Health Policy,10.1101/2020.05.23.20111468,1,Jun Lin,Xi\'an Jiaotong University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.23.20111468v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.23.20111468v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140935
14938,A Comparative Study to Find a Suitable Model for an Improved Real-Time Monitoring of The Interventions to Contain COVID-19 Outbreak in The High Incidence States of India,"Background On March 11, 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a global pandemic. There emerged a need for reliable models to estimate the imminent incidence and overall assessment of the outbreak, in order to develop effective interventions and control strategies. One such vital metrics for monitoring the transmission trends over time is the time-dependent effective reproduction number (Rt). Rt is an estimate of secondary cases caused by an infected individual at a time during the outbreak, given that a certain population proportion is already infected. Misestimated Rt is particularly concerning when probing the association between the changes in transmission rate and the changes in the implemented policies. In this paper, we substantiate the implementation of the instantaneous reproduction number (Rins) method over the conventional method to estimate Rt viz case reproduction number (Rcase), by unmasking the real-time estimation ability of both methodologies using credible datasets. Materials & Methods We employed the daily incidence dataset of COVID-19 for India and high incidence states to estimate Rins and Rcase. We compared the real-time projection obtained through these methods by corroborating those states that are containing a high number of COVID19 cases and are conducting high and efficient COVID-19 testing. The Rins and Rcase were estimated using R0 and EpiEstim packages respectively in R software 4.0.0. Results Although, both the Rins and Rcase for the selected states were higher during the lockdown phases (March 25 - June 1, 2020) and subsequently stabilizes co-equally during the unlock phase (June 1- August 23, 2020), Rins demonstrated variations in accordance with the interventions while Rcase remained generalized and under- & overestimated. A larger difference in Rins and Rcase estimates were also observed for states that are conducting high testing. Conclusion Of the two methods, Rins elucidated a better real-time progression of the COVID-19 outbreak conceptually and empirically, than that of Rcase. However, we also suggest considering the assumptions corroborated in the implementations which may result in misleading conclusions in the real world.","G.s, A.; Sharma, A.; Sharma, A.",2020-09-15,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.14.20190447,1,Abhibhav Sharma,Jawaharlal Nehru University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.14.20190447v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.14.20190447v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
20939,"Impact of COVID-19 on education, health and lifestyle behaviour of Brazilian urology residents","ObjectivesTo evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical and surgical practice, educational activities, health and lifestyle behavior of Brazilian urology residents.

Materials and MethodsA web-based survey was sent to 468 Brazilian urology residents from postgraduate years (PGY) 3 to 5 to collect data on clinical practice and training after 4 months of COVID-19. We also assessed health-related and behavior changes, rate of infection by SARS-CoV-2, deployment to the front line of COVID-19, residents concerns, and access to personal protective equipment (PPE).

ResultsMassive reductions in elective and emergency patient consultations, diagnostic procedures and surgeries were reported across the country, affecting PGY 3 to 5 alike. Most in-person educational activities were abolished. The median damage to the urological training expected for 2020 was 6.0 [3.4 -7.7], on a scale from 0 to 10, with senior residents estimating a greater damage (P< 0.001). Educational interventions developed included online case-based discussions, subspeciality conferences and lectures, and grand rounds. Most senior residents favored extending residency to compensate for training loss and most younger residents favored no additional training (p< 0.001). Modifications in health and lifestyle included weight gain (43.8%), reduced physical activity (68.6%), increased alcoholic intake (44.9%) and cigarette consumption (53.6%), worsening of sexual life (25.2%) and feelings of sadness or depression (48,2%). Almost half were summoned to work on the COVID-19 front-line and 24.4% had COVID-19. Most residents had inadequate training to deal with COVID-19 patients and most reported a shortage of PPE. Residents concerns included the risk of contaminating family members, being away from residency program, developing severe COVID-19 and overloading colleagues.

ConclusionsCOVID-19 had a massive impact in Brazilian urology residents training, health and lifestyle behavior, which may reflect what happened in other medical specialties. Studies should confirm these findings to help developing strategies to mitigate residents losses.","Prezotti, J. A.; Henriques, J. V. T.; Favorito, L.; Canalini, A. F.; Machado, M.

16859,BCG vaccination induces enhanced frequencies of memory T and B cells and dendritic cell subsets in elderly individuals,"BackgroundBCG vaccination is known to induce innate immune memory, which confers protection against heterologous infections. However, the effect of BCG vaccination on the conventional innate and adaptive immune cells subsets is not well characterized.

MethodsWe investigated the impact of BCG vaccination on the frequencies of T cell, B cell, monocyte and dendritic cell subsets as well as total antibody levels in a group of healthy elderly individuals (age 60-80 years) at one month post vaccination as part of our clinical study to examine the effect of BCG on COVID-19.

ResultsOur results demonstrate that BCG vaccination induced enhanced frequencies of central and effector memory CD4+ T cells and diminished frequencies of naive, transitional memory, stem cell memory CD4+ T cells and regulatory T cells. In addition, BCG vaccination induced enhanced frequencies of central, effector and terminal effector memory CD8+ T cells and diminished frequencies of naive, transitional memory and stem cell memory CD8+T cells. BCG vaccination also induced enhanced frequencies of immature, classical and activated memory B cells and plasma cells and diminished frequencies of naive and atypical memory B cells. While BCG vaccination did not induce significant alterations in monocytes subsets, it induced increased frequencies of myeloid and plasmacytoid DCs. Finally, BCG vaccination resulted in elevated levels of all antibody isotypes.

ConclusionsBCG vaccination was associated with enhanced innate and adaptive memory cell subsets, as well as total antibody levels in elderly individuals, suggesting its potential utility in SARS-Cov2 infection by enhancing heterologous immunity.","Pavan Kumar, N.; Padmapriyadarsini, C.; Rajamanickam, A.; Bhavani, P.

5168,COVID-19: Public Compliance with and Public Support for Stay-at-Home Mitigation Strategies,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSObjectivesC_ST_ABSGovernments worldwide have recommended unprecedented measures to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As pressure mounts to scale back these measures, understanding public compliance with and priorities for COVID-19 mitigation is critical. The main aim of this study was to assess public compliance with and support for government-imposed stay-at-home orders in nations and cities with different COVID-19 infection and death rates.

DesignIn this cross-sectional study, questionnaires were administered to nationally representative respondents from April 2-8, 2020.

SettingRegions with different disease prevalence included two nations [the United States (US--high) and Australia (AU--low)] and two cities [New York (NY--high) and Los Angeles (LA--low)].

ParticipantsFor adults 18 years or older residing in specified regions, eligible respondents were empaneled until representative quotas were reached for age, gender, and either race and ethnicity (US, NY, LA) or ancestry (AU), matching the 2010 US or 2016 AU census. Of 8718 eligible potential respondents, 5573 (response rate, 63.9%) completed surveys (US: 3010; NY: 507; LA: 525; AU: 1531). The median age was 47 years (range, 18-89); 3039 (54.5%) were female.

ExposureThe prevalence of COVID-19 in each region (cumulative infections, deaths) as of April 8, 2020: US (458610, 15659), AU (5956, 45),1 NY (81803, 4571), LA (7530, 198).2

Main Outcomes MeasuresPublic compliance with and attitudes regarding government-imposed stay-at-home orders were evaluated and compared between regions.

ResultsOf 5573 total respondents, 4560 (81.8%) reported compliance with recommended quarantine or stay-at-home policies (range of samples, 75.5%-88.2%). Despite significant disruptions of social and work life, health, and behavior, 5022 respondents (90.1%) supported government-imposed stay-at-home orders (range of samples, 88.9%-93.1%). Of these, 90.8% believe orders should last at least three more weeks or until public health or government officials recommend, with such support spanning the political spectrum.

ConclusionsPublic compliance with stringent quarantine and stay-at-home policies was very high, in both highly-affected (US, NY) and minimally-affected regions (AU, LA). Despite extensive disruption of respondents lives, the vast majority supported continuation of long-term government-imposed stay-at-home orders. These findings have important implications for policymakers grappling with the decision as to when to lift restrictions.","Czeisler, M. E.; Howard, M. E.; Robbins, R.; Barger, L. K.; Facer-Childs, E.

12929,The association between lockdown due to COVID-19 epidemic and searches for toothache using Google Trends in Iran,"ObjectiveTo assess the association between the lockdowns due to COVID-19 and online searches for toothache in Iran using Google Trends (GT).

MethodsWe investigated GT online searches for the search term [Formula] within the past five years. The time frame for data gathering was considered as the initiation and end dates of lockdown in Iran. Relative search volumes (RSVs) for online Google Search queries in 2019 was considered as the control. We performed one-way ANOVA statistical test to identify whether there is a statistical difference for RSV scores between the year 2020 and 2016-2019 for the whole country. Then we investigated the possible association of RSVs in provinces with dentists density, prevalence of current daily smokers, Human Development Index (HDI), Internet access, and fluoride concentration in water with linear regression. A p-value<0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

ResultsWhen comparing 2020 with previous four years, there is a statistically significant difference between RSVs of 2020 with all previous years combined and each of these years (P<0.001 for all of them). In the linear model for the year 2020, HDI (B=-3.29, 95% CI: (-5.80, - 0.78), P=0.012), fluoride concentration (B=-0.13, 95% CI: (-0.24, -0.03), P=0.017), and prevalence of daily smokers (B=0.33, 95% CI: (0.13, 0.53), P=0.002) were significantly associated with RSVs. These covariates were not statistically significant for other years, except for Internet access in 2016 (B=-1.13, 95% CI: (-2.26, 0.00), P=0.050).

ConclusionThe RSVs for toothache in 2020 have significantly increased due to COVID-19-imposed lockdowns compared to the same period of the year in the past four years. Knowing that this period mostly overlaps with the national holidays of Nowruz in Iran, reinforces the impacts of lockdowns on peoples CSB about the toothache. In the subnational scale, the RSVs were significantly correlated with HDI, fluoride concentration, and prevalence of daily smokers which emphasises the role of socioeconomic factors in dental health and care-seeking behaviour.","Sofi-Mahmudi, A.; Shamsoddin, E.; Ghasemi, P.; Mehrabi Bahar, A.; Shaban Azad, M.; Sadeghi, G.",2020-08-07,Dentistry And Oral Medicine,10.1101/2020.08.06.20160515,1,Erfan Shamsoddin,"National Institute for Medical Research Development (NIMAD), Tehran, Iran.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.06.20160515v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.06.20160515v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
8443,Duration of Viral Clearance in IDF Soldiers with Mild COVID-19,"Policies determining the duration of quarantine and return to work for confirmed COVID-19 patients still lack evidence. We report our findings regarding the duration of viral RNA positivity among a cohort of young patients with mild disease. Between March 20th, 2020, and May 10th, 2020, 219 soldiers were admitted to the Israel Defense Forces Medical Corps (IDF-MC) COVID-19 rehabilitation center following a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. 119 of these patients, 84 (70.6%) males, 35 (29.4%) females with a median age of 21 (IQR 19-25) were classified as having mild disease and had two consecutive negative RT-PCR tests by May 10th, 2020. The median time for SARS-CoV-2 positivity in nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs in the study population was 21 days (IQR 15-27) from symptom onset, with a range of 4 to 45 days. The results of this study suggest that in young and healthy adult patients with COVID-19, the median duration of viral positivity is around three weeks. This duration is higher than previously reported in other populations. Young and healthy adults comprise much of the population workforce, and the results of this study may assist in determining the isolation period for symptomatic adults and confirmed COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. Further studies on this topic should look to expand and determine the intervals of serial testing for confirmed patients and determine the duration of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in other populations.","Talmy, T.; Tsur, A.; Shabtay, O.",2020-05-31,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.28.20116145,2,Tomer Talmy,"Israel Defense Forces, Medical Corps, Tel Hashomer, Ramat Gan, Israel",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.20116145v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.20116145v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1002/jmv.26374

13952,Dynamic deformable attention (DDANet) for semantic segmentation,"Deep learning based medical image segmentation is an important step within diagnosis, which relies strongly on capturing sufficient spatial context without requiring too complex models that are hard to train with limited labelled data. Training data is in particular scarce for segmenting infection regions of CT images of COVID-19 patients. Attention models help gather contextual information within deep networks and benefit semantic segmentation tasks. The recent criss-cross-attention module aims to approximate global self-attention while remaining memory and time efficient by separating horizontal and vertical selfsimilarity computations. However, capturing attention from all non-local locations can adversely impact the accuracy of semantic segmentation networks. We propose a new Dynamic Deformable Attention Network (DDANet) that enables a more accurate contextual information computation in a similarly efficient way. Our novel technique is based on a deformable criss-cross attention block that learns both attention coefficients and attention offsets in a continuous way. A deep segmentation network (in our case a U-Net [1]) that employs this attention mechanism is able to capture attention from pertinent non-local locations and also improves the performance on semantic segmentation tasks compared to criss-cross attention within a U-Net on a challenging COVID-19 lesion segmentation task. Our validation experiments show that the performance gain of the recursively applied dynamic deformable attention blocks comes from their ability to capture dynamic and precise (wider) attention context. Our DDANet achieves Dice scores of 73.4% and 61.3% for Ground-Glass-Opacity and Consolidation lesions for COVID-19 segmentation and improves the accuracy by 4.9% points compared to a baseline U-Net.","Rajamani, K.

16582,A Comparative Analysis of System Features Used in the TREC-COVID Information Retrieval Challenge,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a rapidly growing quantity of scientific publications from journal articles, preprints, and other sources. The TREC-COVID Challenge was created to evaluate information retrieval methods and systems for this quickly expanding corpus. Based on the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), several dozen research teams participated in over 5 rounds of the TREC-COVID Challenge. While previous work has compared IR techniques used on other test collections, there are no studies that have analyzed the methods used by participants in the TREC-COVID Challenge. We manually reviewed team run reports from Rounds 2 and 5, extracted features from the documented methodologies, and used a univariate and multivariate regression-based analysis to identify features associated with higher retrieval performance. We observed that fine-tuning datasets with relevance judgments, MS-MARCO, and CORD-19 document vectors was associated with improved performance in Round 2 but not in Round 5. Though the relatively decreased heterogeneity of runs in Round 5 may explain the lack of significance in that round, fine-tuning has been found to improve search performance in previous challenge evaluations by improving a systems ability to map relevant queries and phrases to documents. Furthermore, term expansion was associated with improvement in system performance, and the use of the narrative field in the TREC-COVID topics was associated with decreased system performance in both rounds. These findings emphasize the need for clear queries in search. While our study has some limitations in its generalizability and scope of techniques analyzed, we identified some IR techniques that may be useful in building search systems for COVID-19 using the TREC-COVID test collections.","Chen, J.; Hersh, W.",2020-10-20,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.10.15.20213645,1,Jimmy Chen,OHSU,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.20213645v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.20213645v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
11111,SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Rates of Children in Louisiana During the State Stay at Home Order.,"BACKGROUNDChildren ([&le;]18 years) account for [~]20% of the US population but currently represent <2% of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Because infected children often have few or no symptoms and may not be tested, the extent of infection in children is poorly understood.

METHODSDuring the March 18th-May 15th 2020 Louisiana Stay At Home Order, 1690 blood samples from 812 individuals from a Childrens Hospital were tested for antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein. Demographics, COVID-19 testing, and clinical presentation abstracted from medical records were compared with local COVID-19 cases.

RESULTSIn total, 62 subjects (7.6%) were found to be seropositive. The median age was 11 years with 50.4% female. The presenting complaint of seropositive patients was chronic illness (43.5%). Only 18.2% had a previous positive COVID-19 PCR or antibody test. Seropositivity was significantly associated with parish (counties), race, and residence in a low-income area. Importantly, seropositivity was linearly correlated with cumulative COVID-19 case number for all ages by parish.

CONCLUSIONIn a large retrospective study, the seropositivity prevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in children in Louisiana during the mandated Stay At Home Order was 7.6%. Residence location, race, and lower socioeconomic factors were linked to more frequent seropositivity in children and correlated to regional COVID-19 case rates. Thus, a significant number of children in Louisiana had SARS-CoV-2 infections that went undetected and unreported and may have contributed to virus transmission.","Dietrich, M. L.; Norton, E.

We included primary studies reporting on asymptomatic prevalence where: (a) the sample frame includes at-risk population, and (b) there was sufficiently long follow up to identify pre-symptomatic cases. Meta-analysis used fixed effect and random effects models. We assessed risk of bias by combination of questions adapted from risk of bias tools for prevalence and diagnostic accuracy studies.

ResultsWe screened 998 articles and included nine low risk-of-bias studies from six countries that tested 21,035 at-risk people, of which 559 were positive and 83 were asymptomatic. Diagnosis in all studies was confirmed using a RT-qPCR test. The proportion of asymptomatic cases ranged from 4% to 41%. Meta-analysis (fixed effect) found that the proportion of asymptomatic cases was 15% (95% CI: 12% - 18%) overall; higher in non-aged care 16% (13% - 19%), and lower in long-term aged care 8% (3% - 18%). Four studies provided direct evidence of forward transmission of the infection by asymptomatic cases but suggested considerably lower rates than symptomatic cases.

DiscussionOur estimates of the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and asymptomatic transmission rates are lower than many highly publicized studies, but still sufficient to warrant policy attention. Further robust epidemiological evidence is urgently needed, including in sub-populations such as children, to better understand the importance of asymptomatic cases for driving spread of the pandemic.

14840,Development of a serological assay to identify SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 patients,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While molecular assays are used to detect viral genetic material for the diagnosis of acute infection, reliable serological assays are needed to measure immunity against SARS-CoV-2. In this report, we describe an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that detects antibodies against the following SARS-CoV-2 recombinant proteins: the full-length spike (S) protein and the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Our assay is sensitive and specific for immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgA and IgM anti-S protein and anti-RBD antibodies. Samples were pre-treated with Triton X-100 to inactivate potential virus without affecting antibody detection. Our in-house ELISA performed as well as the commercial EUROIMMUN and Ortho assays for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. This method provides a high-throughput assay that does not require specialized instrumentation and can be widely used to determine immunity and the dynamic range of antibodies found within SARS-CoV-2.","Huynh, A.; Arnold, D.

16507,COVID-19 In a Rural Health System in New York - Case Series and an Approach to Management,"BackgroundMany rural hospitals and health systems in the U.S. lack sufficient resources to treat COVID-19. We developed a system for managing inpatient COVID-19 hospital admissions in St. Lawrence County, an underserved rural county which is the largest county in New York State.

MethodsWe used a hub and spoke system to route COVID-19 patients in the St. Lawrence Health System to its flagship hospital. We assembled a small clinical team to manage admitted COVID-19 patients and to stay abreast of a quickly changing body of literature and standard of care. We subsequently completed a review of clinical data for patients who were treated by our inpatient COVID-19 treatment team between March 20 and May 22, 2020.

ResultsTwenty COVID-19 patients were identified. Sixteen patients (80%) met NIH criteria for severe or critical disease. One patient died. No patients were transferred to other hospitals.

ConclusionsDuring the first two months of the pandemic, we were able to manage hospitalized COVID-19 patients in our rural community. Development of similar treatment models in other rural areas should be considered.","Kedar, E.; Scott, R.; Soule, D.; Lovelett, C.; Tower, K.; Broughal, K.; Jaremczuk, D.; Mohaddes, S.; Rainey-Spence, I.; Atkinson, T.",2020-10-18,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.15.20213348,1,Eyal Kedar,"St. Lawrence Health System, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.20213348v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.20213348v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
6399,Variation in SARS-CoV-2 free-living survival and environmental transmission can modulate the intensity of emerging outbreaks,"Variation in free-living, microparasite survival can have a meaningful impact on the ecological dynamics of established and emerging infectious diseases. Nevertheless, resolving the importance of environmental transmission in the ecology of epidemics remains a persistent challenge, requires accurate measuring the free-living survival of pathogens across reservoirs of various kinds, and quantifying the extent to which interaction between hosts and reservoirs generates new infections. These questions are especially salient for emerging pathogens, where sparse and noisy data can obfuscate the relative contribution of different infection routes. In this study, we develop a mechanistic, mathematical model that permits both direct (host-to-host) and indirect (environmental) transmission and then fit this model to empirical data from 17 countries affected by an emerging virus (SARS-CoV-2). From an ecological perspective, our model highlights the potential for environmental transmission to drive complex, non-linear dynamics during infectious disease outbreaks. Summarizing, we propose that fitting such models with environmental transmission to real outbreak data from SARS-CoV-2 transmission highlights that variation in environmental transmission is an underappreciated aspect of the ecology of infectious disease, and an incomplete understanding of its role has consequences for public health interventions.","Ogbunugafor, C.

20788,SARS-CoV-2 recruits a haem metabolite to evade antibody immunity,"The coronaviral spike is the dominant viral antigen and the target of neutralizing antibodies. We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike binds biliverdin and bilirubin, the tetrapyrrole products of haem metabolism, with nanomolar affinity. Using cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography we mapped the tetrapyrrole interaction pocket to a deep cleft on the spike N-terminal domain (NTD). At physiological concentrations, biliverdin significantly dampened the reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 spike with immune sera and inhibited a subset of neutralizing antibodies. Access to the tetrapyrrole-sensitive epitope is gated by a flexible loop on the distal face of the NTD. Accompanied by profound conformational changes in the NTD, antibody binding requires relocation of the gating loop, which folds into the cleft vacated by the metabolite. Our results indicate that the virus co-opts the haem metabolite for the evasion of humoral immunity via allosteric shielding of a sensitive epitope and demonstrate the remarkable structural plasticity of the NTD.","Rosa, A.; Pye, V.

5241,COVID-19 Fatality and Comorbidity Risk Factors among Confirmed Patients in Mexico,"As of April 18, 2020, 2.16 million patients in the world had been tested positive with Coronavirus (COVID-19) and 146,088 had died, which accounts for a case fatality rate of 6.76%. In Mexico, according to official statistics (April 18), 7,497 cases have been confirmed with 650 deaths, for a case fatality rate of 8.67%. These estimates, however, may not reflect the final fatality risk among COVID-19 confirmed patients, because they are based on cross-sectional counts of diagnosed and deceased patients, and therefore are not adjusted by time of exposure and right-censorship. In this paper we estimate fatality risks based on survival analysis methods, calculated from individual-level data on symptomatic patients confirmed with COVID-19 recently released by the Mexican Ministry of Health. The estimated fatality risk after 35 days of onset of symptoms is 12.38% (95% CI: 11.37-13.47). Fatality risks sharply rise with age, and significantly increase for males (59%) and individuals with comorbidities (38%-168%, depending on the disease). Two reasons may explain the high COVID-19 related fatality risk observed in Mexico, despite its younger age structure: the high selectivity and self-selectivity in testing and the high prevalence of chronic-degenerative diseases.","Solis, P.; Carreno, H.",2020-04-25,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.21.20074591,1,Patricio Solís,El Colegio de México,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.21.20074591v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.21.20074591v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
9680,"Assessment of Early Mitigation Measures Against COVID-19 in Puerto Rico: March 15-May 15, 2020","BackgroundOn March 15, 2020 Puerto Rico implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including a mandatory curfew, as part of a state of emergency declaration to mitigate the community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The strict enforcement of this curfew was extended through May 25, with a gradual relaxation beginning on May 1. This report summarizes an assessment of these early mitigation measures on the progression of COVID-19 in the island.

Methods and FindingsFrom March 15 to May 15, 2020, 41,748 results of molecular (RT-PCR) tests were reported to the Puerto Rico Department of Health. Of these, 1,866 (4.5%) were positive, corresponding to 1,219 individuals with COVID-19 included in the study. We derived the epidemic growth rates (r) and the corresponding reproductive numbers (R) from the epidemic curve of these 1,219 individuals with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 using their date of test collection as a proxy for symptoms onset. We then compared the observed cases with the R-based epidemic model projections had the mitigation measures not been implemented. Computations were conducted in the R packages forecast, incidence and projections.

The number of daily RT-PCR-confirmed cases peaked on March 30 (84 cases), showing a weekly cyclical trend, with lower counts on weekends and a decreasing secular trend since March 30. The initial exponential growth rate (r) was 17.0% (95% CI: 8.4%, 25.6%), corresponding to a doubling of cases every 4.1 days, and to a reproduction number (Ro) of 1.89 (95% CI: 1.41, 2.39). After March 30, the r value reverted to an exponential decay rate (negative) of -3.6% (95% CI: -5.7%, -1.4%), corresponding to a halving of cases every 19.4 days and to an Ro of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.97). Had the initial growth rate been maintained, a total of 18,699 (96%CI: 4,113, 87,438) COVID-19 cases would have occurred by April 30 compared with 1,119 observed.

ConclusionsOur findings are consistent with very effective implementation of early non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as mitigation measures in Puerto Rico. These results serve as a baseline to assess the impact of the transition from mitigation to containment stages in Puerto Rico.","Valencia, M.; Becerra, J. E.; Reyes, J. C.; Castro, K.

12243,Daily Forecasting of New Cases for Regional Epidemics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 with Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification,"To increase situational awareness and support evidence-based policy-making, we formulated a mathematical model for COVID-19 transmission within a regional population. This compartmental model accounts for quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing, a non-exponentially distributed incubation period, asymptomatic individuals, and mild and severe forms of symptomatic disease. Using Bayesian inference, we have been calibrating region-specific models daily for consistency with new reports of confirmed cases from the 15 most populous metropolitan statistical areas in the United States and quantifying uncertainty in parameter estimates and predictions of future case reports. This online learning approach allows for early identification of new trends despite considerable variability in case reporting.

16461,Stay-at-home policy: is it a case of exception fallacy? An internet-based ecological study,"BackgroundCountries with strict lockdown had a spike on the number of deaths. A recent mathematical model has suggested that staying at home did not play a dominant role in reducing COVID-19 transmission. Comparison between number of deaths and social mobility is difficult due to the non-stationary nature of the COVID-19 data.

ObjectiveTo propose a novel approach to assess the association between staying at home values and the reduction/increase in the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in several regions around the world.

MethodsIn this ecological study, data from www.google.com/covid19/mobility/, ourworldindata.org and covid.saude.gov.br were combined. Countries with >100 deaths and with a Healthcare Access and Quality Index of [&ge;]67 were included. Data were preprocessed and analyzed using the difference between number of deaths/million between 2 regions and the difference between the percentage of staying at home. Analysis was performed using linear regression and residual analysis

ResultsAfter preprocessing the data, 87 regions around the world were included, yielding 3,741 pairwise comparisons for linear regression analysis. Only 63 (1.6%) comparisons were significant.

DiscussionWith our results, we were not able to explain if COVID-19 mortality is reduced by staying as home in [~]98% of the comparisons after epidemiological weeks 9 to 34.","Savaris, R.

14530,"Relationships of total COVID-19 cases and deaths with ten demographic, economic and social indicators","We have used data for 45 countries with a population of over 30 millions in which 85.8% of the worlds population lives. The statistical relationships of total COVID-19 Cases and Deaths per million populations in these countries with 10 demographic, economic and social indicators (indices) were studied. These indicators are Life Expectancy, Median Age, Growth Rate, Population Density, GDP PPP per capita, Human Development Index (HDI), Gini index of income equality, Intelligence Quotient (IQ), Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) and Democracy Index. Statistically significant relationships were found with all indicators excluding Gini index and Population Density. We have found that the closest is the relationship of Deaths per million population and total Cases per million population with correlation coefficient R = 0.926. Therefore, it is clear statistically that the more are Cases per million in a country the more are Deaths per million. This confirms the correctness of the timely and effective introduction of the necessary pandemic restrictions in the countries.

It is interesting that the close correlations were found of Cases and Deaths per 1 million with a purely economic index like GDP PPP per capita, where R = 0.687 and R = 0.660, respectively. Even more close correlations were found of Cases and Deaths per 1 million with a composite index HDI, where the correlation coefficients reach 0.724 and 0.680, respectively. This paradoxical results show that the richest and well-being countries are most seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The most probable reason for this is the large percentage of aging population, comorbidity of population with severe chronic diseases and obesity in countries with high GDP and HDI. No less important reason appears the delayed and/or insufficiently effective pandemic restrictions in these countries, which have underestimated the danger of a pandemic in early stage.

Other indicators (excluding Gini index and Population Density) also show statistically significant correlations with Cases and Deaths per 1 million with correlation coefficients from 0.432 to 0.634. The countries that deviates the most from the regression lines were shown. Surprisingly, there was no statistically significant correlation between Cases and Deaths with Population Density. The statistical significance of the found correlations determined using Students t-test was p < 0.0001. The countries that deviate the most from both sides of the regression line were shown. It has been shown that the correlations of COVID-19 cases and Deaths with the studied indicators decrease with time.","Valev, D.",2020-12-27,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.05.20188953,2,Dimitar Valev,"Space Research and Technology Institute, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.20188953v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.20188953v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA

13634,Whether Early Pulse Steroid dose is associated with lower mortality in COVID-19 critically ill Patients- An exploratory retrospective Chart Review,"IntroductionSteroids have shown its usefulness in critically ill COVID19 patients. However time of starting steroid and dose tailored to severity remains a matter of inquiry due to still emerging evidences and wide-ranging concerns of benefits and harms. We did a retrospective record analysis in an apex teaching hospital ICU setting to explore optimal doses and duration of steroid therapy which can decrease mortality.

Methodology114 adults with COVID19-ARDS admitted to ICU between 20thMarch-15thAugust2020 were included in chart review. We did preliminary exploratory analysis(rooted in steroid therapy matrix categorized by dose and duration) to understand the effect of several covariates on survival. This was followed by univariate and multivariate Cox proportion hazard regression analysis and model diagnostics.

ResultsExploratory analysis and visualization indicated age, optimal steroid, severity (measured in P/F) of disease and infection status as potential covariates for survival. Univariate cox regression analysis showed significant positive association of age>60 years{2.6 (1.5-4.7)} and protective effect of optimum steroid{0.38(0.2-0.72)} on death (hazard) in critically ill patients. Multivariate cox regression analysis after adjusting effect of age showed protective effect of optimum steroid on hazard defined as death {0.46(0.23-0.87),LR=17.04,(p=2e- 04)}.The concordance was 0.70 and model diagnostics fulfilled the assumption criteria for proportional hazard model.

ConclusionOptimal dose steroid as per defined  optimum (<24 hours and doses tailored to P/F at presentation) criteria can offer protective effect from mortality which persists after adjusting for age. This protective effect was not found to be negatively influenced by the risk of infection.

13100,Long-term exposure to air-pollution and COVID-19 mortality in England: a hierarchical spatial analysis,"BackgroundRecent studies suggested a link between long-term exposure to air-pollution and COVID-19 mortality. However, due to their ecological design, based on large spatial units, they neglect the strong localised air-pollution patterns, and potentially lead to inadequate confounding adjustment. We investigated the effect of long-term exposure to NO2 and PM2{middle dot}5 on COVID-19 deaths up to June 30, 2020 in England using high geographical resolution. Methods We included 38 573 COVID-19 deaths up to June 30, 2020 at the Lower Layer Super Output Area level in England (n=32 844 small areas). We retrieved averaged NO2 and PM2{middle dot}5 concentration during 2014-2018 from the Pollution Climate Mapping. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to quantify the effect of air-pollution while adjusting for a series of confounding and spatial autocorrelation.

FindingsWe find a 0{middle dot}5% (95% credible interval: -0{middle dot}2%-1{middle dot}2%) and 1{middle dot}4% (-2{middle dot}1%-5{middle dot}1%) increase in COVID-19 mortality rate for every 1g/m3 increase in NO2 and PM2{middle dot}5 respectively, after adjusting for confounding and spatial autocorrelation. This corresponds to a posterior probability of a positive effect of 0{middle dot}93 and 0{middle dot}78 respectively. The spatial relative risk at LSOA level revealed strong patterns, similar for the different pollutants. This potentially captures the spread of the disease during the first wave of the epidemic.

InterpretationOur study provides some evidence of an effect of long-term NO2 exposure on COVID-19 mortality, while the effect of PM2{middle dot}5 remains more uncertain.

8121,COVID-19 Open Source Data Sets: A Comprehensive Survey,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWIn December 2019, a novel virus named COVID-19 emerged in the city of Wuhan, China. In early 2020, the COVID-19 virus spread in all continents of the world except Antarctica causing widespread infections and deaths due to its contagious characteristics and no medically proven treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has been termed as the most consequential global crisis after the World Wars. The first line of defense against the COVID-19 spread are the non-pharmaceutical measures like social distancing and personal hygiene. The great pandemic affecting billions of lives economically and socially has motivated the scientific community to come up with solutions based on computer-aided digital technologies for diagnosis, prevention, and estimation of COVID-19. Some of these efforts focus on statistical and Artificial Intelligence-based analysis of the available data concerning COVID-19. All of these scientific efforts necessitate that the data brought to service for the analysis should be open source to promote the extension, validation, and collaboration of the work in the fight against the global pandemic. Our survey is motivated by the open source efforts that can be mainly categorized as (a) COVID-19 diagnosis from CT scans, X-ray images, and cough sounds, (b) COVID-19 case reporting, transmission estimation, and prognosis from epidemiological, demographic, and mobility data, (c) COVID-19 emotional and sentiment analysis from social media, and (d) knowledge-based discovery and semantic analysis from the collection of scholarly articles covering COVID-19.

15814,Seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2 Antibodies in Scottish Healthcare Workers,"IntroductionHealthcare workers are believed to be at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The extent of that increased risk compared to the general population and the groups most at risk have not been extensively studied.

MethodsA prospective observational study of health and social care workers in NHS Tayside (Scotland, UK) from May to September 2020. The Siemens SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay was used to establish seroprevalence in this cohort. Patients provided clinical information including demographics and workplace information. Controls, matched for age and sex to the general Tayside population, were studied for comparison.

ResultsA total of 2062 health and social care workers were recruited for this study. The participants were predominantly female (81.7%) and 95.2% were white. 299 healthcare workers had a positive antibody test (14.5%). 11 out of 231 control sera tested positive (4.8%). Healthcare workers therefore had an increased likelihood of a positive test (odds ratio 3.4 95% CI 1.85-6.16, p<0.0001). Dentists, healthcare assistants and porters were the job roles most likely to test positive. Those working in front-line roles with COVID-19 patients were more likely to test positive (17.4% vs. 13.4%, p=0.02). 97.1% of patients who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR had positive antibodies, compared to 11.8% of individuals with a symptomatic illness who had tested negative. Anosmia was the symptom most associated with the presence of detectable antibodies.

ConclusionIn this study, healthcare workers were three times more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. The seroprevalence data in different populations identified in this study will be useful to protect healthcare staff during future waves of the pandemic.","Abo-Leyah, H.; Gallant, S.; Cassidy, D.; Giam, Y.

17334,SARS-CoV-2 Infection Hospitalization Rate and Infection Fatality Rate among the Non-Congregant Population in Connecticut,"ImportanceCOVID-19 case fatality and hospitalization rates, calculated using the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, have been described widely in the literature. However, the number of infections confirmed by testing underestimates the total infections as it is biased based on the availability of testing and because asymptomatic individuals may remain untested. The infection fatality rate (IFR) and infection hospitalization rate (IHR), calculated using the estimated total infections based on a representative sample of a population, is a better metric to assess the actual toll of the disease.

ObjectiveTo determine the IHR and IFR for COVID-19 using the statewide SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence estimates for the non-congregate population in Connecticut.

DesignCross-sectional.

SettingAdults residing in a non-congregate setting in Connecticut between March 1 and June 1, 2020.

ParticipantsIndividuals aged 18 years or above.

ExposureEstimated number of adults with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Main Outcome and MeasuresCOVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths among adults residing in a non-congregate setting in Connecticut between March 1 and June 1, 2020.

ResultsOf the 2.8 million individuals residing in the non-congregate settings in Connecticut through June 2020, 113,515 (90% CI 56,758-170,273) individuals had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. There were a total of 9425 COVID-19-related hospitalizations and 4071 COVID-19-related deaths in Connecticut between March 1 and June 1, 2020, of which 7792 hospitalizations and 1079 deaths occurred among the non-congregate population. The overall COVID-19 IHR and IFR was 6.86% (90% CI, 4.58%-13.72%) and 0.95% (90% CI, 0.63%-1.90%) among the non-congregate population. Older individuals, men, non-Hispanic Black individuals and those belonging to New Haven and Litchfield counties had a higher burden of hospitalization and deaths, compared with younger individuals, women, non-Hispanic White or Hispanic individuals, and those belonging to New London county, respectively.

Conclusion and RelevanceUsing representative seroprevalence estimates, the overall COVID-19 IHR and IFR were estimated to be 6.86% and 0.95% among the non-congregate population in Connecticut. Accurate estimation of IHR and IFR among community residents is important to guide public health strategies during an infectious disease outbreak.","Mahajan, S.; Caraballo, C.; Li, S.-X.; Dong, C.; Chen, L.; Huston, S.

6074,Lockdown exit strategies and risk of a second epidemic peak: a stochastic agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France,"Most European countries have responded to the COVID-19 threat by nationwide implementation of barrier measures and lockdown. However, assuming that population immunity will build up through the epidemic, it is likely to rebound once these measures are relaxed, possibly leading to a second or multiple repeated lockdowns. In this report, we present results of epidemiological modelling that has helped inform policy making in France. We used a stochastic agent-based microsimulation model of the COVID-19 epidemic in France, and examined the potential impact of post-quarantine measures, including social distancing, mask-wearing, and shielding of the population the most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infection, on the diseases cumulative incidence and mortality, and on ICU-bed occupancy. The model calibrated well and variation of model parameter values had little impact on outcome estimates. While quarantine is effective in containing the viral spread, it would be unlikely to prevent a rebound of the epidemic once lifted, regardless of its duration. Both social distancing and mask-wearing, although effective in slowing the epidemic and in reducing mortality, would also be ineffective in ultimately preventing the overwhelming of ICUs and a second lockdown. However, these measures coupled with shielding of vulnerable people would be associated with better outcomes, including lower cumulative incidence, mortality, and maintaining an adequate number of ICU beds to prevent a second lockdown. Benefits would nonetheless be markedly reduced if these measures were not applied by most people or not maintained for a sufficiently long period, as herd immunity progressively establishes in the less vulnerable population.","Hoertel, N.; Blachier, M.; Blanco, C.; Olfson, M.; Massetti, M.; Sanchez Rico, M.; Limosin, F.; Leleu, H.",2020-05-05,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.04.30.20086264,1,Nicolas Hoertel,AP-HP.Centre and Paris University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.30.20086264v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.30.20086264v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
7675,COVID-19 in China: Risk Factors and R0 Revisited,"The COVID-19 epidemic had spread rapidly through China and subsequently has proliferated globally leading to a pandemic situation around the globe. Human-to-human transmissions, as well as asymptomatic transmissions of the infection, have been confirmed. As of April 3rd public health crisis in China due to COVID-19 is potentially under control. We compiled a daily dataset of case counts, mortality, recovery, temperature, population density, and demographic information for each prefecture during the period of January 11 to April 07, 2020 (excluding Wuhan from our analysis due to missing data). Understanding the characteristics of spatiotemporal clustering of the COVID-19 epidemic and R0 is critical in effectively preventing and controlling the ongoing global pandemic. The prefectures were grouped based on several relevant features using unsupervised machine learning techniques. We performed a computational analysis utilizing the reported cases in China to estimate the revised R0 among different regions for prevention planning in an ongoing global pandemic. Finally, our results indicate that the impact of temperature and demographic (different age group percentage compared to the total population) factors on virus transmission may be characterized using a stochastic transmission model. Such predictions will help prioritize segments of a given community/region for action and provide a visual aid in designing prevention strategies for a specific geographic region. Furthermore, revised estimation and our methodology will aid in improving the human health consequences of COVID-19 elsewhere.","Khan, I.

18195,IMPACT OF THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 PANDEMIC ON SURGICAL VOLUME IN JAPAN: A COHORT STUDY USING ADMINISTRATIVE DATA,"BackgroundInternationally, the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused unprecedented challenges for surgical staff to minimise the exposure to COVID-19 or save medical resources without harmful outcomes for patients, in accordance with the statement of each surgical society. However, no research has empirically validated declines in Japanese surgical volume or compared decrease rates of surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Material and MethodsWe extracted 672,772 available cases of patients aged > 15 years who were discharged between July 1, 2018, and June 30, 2020. After categorisation of surgery, we calculated descriptive statistics to compare the year-over-year trend and conducted interrupted time series analysis to validate the decline.

ResultsThe year-over-year trend of all eight surgical categories decreased from April 2020 and reached a minimum in May 2020 (May: abdominal, 68.4%; thoracic, 85.8%; genitourinary, 78.6%; cardiovascular, 90.8%; neurosurgical, 69.1%; orthopaedic, 62.4%; ophthalmologic, 52.0%; ear/nose/throat, 27.3%). Interrupted time series analysis showed no significant trends in oncological and critical benign surgeries.

ConclusionWe demonstrated and validated a trend of reduction in surgical volume in Japan using administrative data applying interrupted time series analyses.

11655,Outcome of hospitalisation for COVID-19 in patients with Interstitial Lung Disease: An international multicentre study.,"RationaleThe impact of COVID-19 on patients with Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) has not been established.

ObjectivesTo assess outcomes following COVID-19 in patients with ILD versus those without in a contemporaneous age, sex and comorbidity matched population.

MethodsAn international multicentre audit of patients with a prior diagnosis of ILD admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between 1 March and 1 May 2020 was undertaken and compared with patients, without ILD obtained from the ISARIC 4C cohort, admitted with COVID-19 over the same period. The primary outcome was survival. Secondary analysis distinguished IPF from non-IPF ILD and used lung function to determine the greatest risks of death.

Measurements and Main ResultsData from 349 patients with ILD across Europe were included, of whom 161 were admitted to hospital with laboratory or clinical evidence of COVID-19 and eligible for propensity-score matching. Overall mortality was 49% (79/161) in patients with ILD with COVID-19. After matching ILD patients with COVID-19 had higher mortality (HR 1.60, Confidence Intervals 1.17-2.18 p=0.003) compared with age, sex and comorbidity matched controls without ILD. Patients with a Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) of <80% had an increased risk of death versus patients with FVC [&ge;]80% (HR 1.72, 1.05-2.83). Furthermore, obese patients with ILD had an elevated risk of death (HR 1.98, 1.13-3.46).

ConclusionsPatients with ILD are at increased risk of death from COVID-19, particularly those with poor lung function and obesity. Stringent precautions should be taken to avoid COVID-19 in patients with ILD.","Jenkins, G.; Drake, T.; Docherty, A.

3017,Outbreak analysis with a logistic growth model shows COVID-19 suppression dynamics in China,"China reported a major outbreak of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, from mid-January till mid-March 2020. The number of cases outside China is now growing fast, while in mainland China the virus outbreak is largely under control. We review the epidemic virus growth and decline curves in China using a phenomenological logistic growth model to summarize the outbreak dynamics using three parameters that characterize the epidemics timing, rate and peak. During the initial phase, the number of virus cases doubled every 2.7 (range 2.2 - 4.4) days. The rate of increase in the number of reported cases peaked approximately 10 days after suppression measures were started on 23-25 January 2020. The peak in the number of reported sick cases occurred on average 18 days after the start of measures. From the time of starting measures till the peak, the number of cases increased by a factor 39 in the province Hubei, and by a factor 9.5 for all of China (range: 6.2-20.4 in the other provinces). Complete suppression took up to 2 months (range: 23-57d.), during which period severe restrictions, social distancing measures, testing and isolation of cases were in place. The suppression of the disease in China has been successful, demonstrating that suppression is a viable strategy to contain SARS-CoV2.","Zou, Y.; Pan, S.; Zhao, P.; Han, L.; Wang, X.; Hemerik, L.; Knops, J.; Van Der Werf, W.",2020-04-15,Health Policy,10.1101/2020.03.25.20043539,2,Wopke Van Der Werf,Wageningen University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043539v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043539v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1371/journal.pone.0235247
4403,Delayed clearance of SARS-CoV2 in male compared to female patients: High ACE2 expression in testes suggests possible existence of gender-specific viral reservoirs,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 has been observed to cause a higher incidence and greater severity of disease in males, as seen in multiple cohorts across the globe. The reasons for gender disparity in disease severity is unclear and can be due to host factors. To determine whether males have delayed viral clearance after infection, we evaluated the time to clearance in symptomatic patients tested by serial oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swabs followed by RT-PCR at a reference lab in Mumbai, India. A total of 68 subjects with median age of 37 years (3-75 range) were examined and included 48 (71%) males and 20 (29%) females. We observed that females were able to achieve viral clearance significantly earlier than males, with a median difference of 2 days in achieving a negative PCR result (P value = 0.038). Furthermore, examination of 3 families with both male and female patients followed serially, demonstrated that female members of the same household cleared the SARS-CoV2 infection earlier in each family. To determine reasons for delayed clearance in males, we examined the expression patterns of the SARS-CoV2 receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), in tissue specific repositories. We observed that the testes was one of the highest sites of ACE2 expression in 3 independent RNA expression databases (Human Protein Atlas, FAMTOM5 and GETx). ACE2 was also determined to be highly expressed in testicular cells at the protein levels. Interestingly, very little expression of ACE2 was seen in ovarian tissue. Taken together, these observations demonstrate for the first time that male subjects have delayed viral clearance of SARS-CoV2. High expression of ACE2 in testes raises the possibility that testicular viral reservoirs may play a role in viral persistence in males and should be further investigated.","Shastri, A.; Wheat, J.; Agrawal, S.; Chaterjee, N.; Pradhan, K.; Goldfinger, M.; Kornblum, N.; Steidl, U.; Verma, A.; Shastri, J.",2020-04-17,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.16.20060566,1,Jayanthi Shastri,"Topiwala National Medical College & BYL Nair Hospital, Kasturba Hospital for Infections Diseases, Mumbai, India",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20060566v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20060566v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
14114,Factors Associated with Good Patient Outcomes Following Convalescent Plasma in COVID-19: A Prospective Phase II Clinical Trial,"We conducted a prospective single-arm open-label phase II clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Convalescent plasma with sufficient IgG titer (1:320) obtained from recovered donors was administered to adult patients with either severe or critical COVID-19 illness. Primary outcomes were adverse events in association with plasma administration, and hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included disease progression, recovery, length of stay, and hospital discharge. Of the 38 patients included in the analysis, 24 (63%) recovered and were discharged, and 14 (37%) died. Patients who received convalescent plasma early in the disease course (severe illness group) as compared to the patients that received convalescent plasma later in disease progression (critical illness group) had significantly lower hospital mortality 13% vs 55% (p<0.02) and shorter mean hospital length of stay 15.4 vs 33 days (p<0.01). One patient experienced a transient transfusion reaction. No other adverse effects of convalescent plasma infusion were observed. Our results suggest that convalescent plasma is safe and has the potential for positive impact on clinical outcomes including recovery and survival if given to patients early in the course of COVID-19 disease.","Ibrahim, D.; Dulipsingh, L.; Zapatka, L.; Eadie, R.; Crowell, R.; Williams, K.; Wakefield, D.; Cook, L.; Puff, J.; Hussain, S.

4568,Mesenchymal stromal cells for COVID-19: A living systematic review protocol,"ObjectiveTo determine the impact of mesenchymal stromal cells outcomes important to patients with COVID-19.

DesignThis is the protocol of a living systematic review.

Data sourcesWe will conduct searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature and in a centralised repository in L{middle dot}OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L{middle dot}OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L{middle dot}OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methodsWe adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question.

We will include randomised trials evaluating the effect of mesenchymal stromal cells versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomised trials evaluating other coronavirus infections, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19 will be searched in case we find no direct evidence from randomised trials, or if the direct evidence provides low- or very low-certainty for critical outcomes.

Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will pool the results using meta-analysis and will apply the GRADE system to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates.

Ethics and disseminationNo ethics approval is considered necessary. The results of this review will be widely disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, social networks and traditional media.

3489,Quantifying the impact of physical distance measures on the transmission of COVID-19 in the UK,"BackgroundTo mitigate and slow the spread of COVID-19, many countries have adopted unprecedented physical distancing policies, including the UK. We evaluate whether these measures might be sufficient to control the epidemic by estimating their impact on the reproduction number (R0, the average number of secondary cases generated per case).

MethodsWe asked a representative sample of UK adults about their contact patterns on the previous day. The questionnaire documents the age and location of contacts and as well as a measure of their intimacy (whether physical contact was made or not). In addition, we asked about adherence to different physical distancing measures. The first surveys were sent on Tuesday 24th March, one day after a "" lockdown"" was implemented across the UK. We compared measured contact patterns during the "" lockdown"" to patterns of social contact made during a non-epidemic period. By comparing these, we estimated the change in reproduction number as a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed. We used a meta-analysis of published estimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions were put in place.

FindingsWe found a 73% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant (from 10.2 to 2.9). This would be sufficient to reduce R0 from 2.6 prior to lockdown to 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37 - 0.89) after the lockdown, based on all types of contact and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.22 - 0.53) for physical contacts only.

InterpretationThe physical distancing measures adopted by the UK public have substantially reduced contact levels and will likely lead to a substantial impact and a decline in cases in the coming weeks. However, this projected decline in incidence will not occur immediately as there are significant delays between infection, the onset of symptomatic disease and hospitalisation, as well as further delays to these events being reported. Tracking behavioural change can give a more rapid assessment of the impact of physical distancing measures than routine epidemiological surveillance.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSMany governments have adopted physical distancing measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is unclear to what extent these measures reduce the number of contacts and therefore transmission. We searched PubMed and medRxiv on March 28, 2020, with the terms "" (coronavirus OR COVID-19 OR influenza) AND ((school OR work) AND (closure OR holiday)) AND (contact OR mixing)"" and identified 59 and 17 results, respectively. Only one study conducted in China during the COVID-19 pandemic reported a reduction in daily contacts outside the home during the period of "" lockdown"". We found no other published articles that empirically quantify the impact of these measures on age- and location-specific mixing patterns.

Added value of this studyBy surveying adults behaviour in the UK during a period of stringent physical distancing ("" lockdown"") and comparing the results to previously collected data, we found a large reduction in daily contacts particularly outside the home, resulting in a marked reduction in the estimated reproduction number from 2.6 to 0.62 (95% bootstrapped confidence interval [CI] 0.37 - 0.89). This method allows for rapid assessment of changes in the reproduction number that is unaffected by reporting delays.

Implications of all the available evidenceChanges in human contact behaviour drive respiratory infection rates. Understanding these changes at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic allows us to rapidly quantify the impact of physical distancing measures on the transmission of pathogens.","Jarvis, C.

15005,Disease control as an optimization problem,"Traditionally, expert epidemiologists devise policies for disease control through a mixture of intuition and brute force. Namely, they use their know-how to narrow down the set of logically conceivable policies to a small family described by a few parameters, following which they conduct a grid search to identify the optimal policy within the set. This scheme is not scalable, in the sense that, when used to optimize over policies which depend on many parameters, it would likely fail to output an optimal disease policy in time for its implementation. In this article, we use techniques from convex optimization theory and machine learning to conduct optimizations over disease policies described by hundreds of parameters. We illustrate our approach by minimizing the total time required to eradicate COVID-19 within the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model proposed by Kissler et al. (March, 2020). We observe that optimal policies are typically very complex, and thus unlikely to be discovered by a human agent.","Navascues, M.; Guryanova, Y.; Budroni, C.",2020-09-18,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.15.20194811,1,Miguel Navascues,Austrian Academy of Sciences,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.15.20194811v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.15.20194811v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
10526,Lung Ultrasound Findings in Patients Hospitalized with Covid-19,"IntroductionPoint-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has the potential to transform healthcare delivery in the era of COVID-19 with its diagnostic and therapeutic expediency. It can be performed by clinicians already at the bedside, which permits an immediate and augmented assessment of a patient. Although lung ultrasound can be used to accurately diagnose a variety of disease states such as pneumothorax, pleural effusions, pneumonia and interstitial lung disease2, there are limited reports on the sonographic manifestations of COVID-19. There is an urgent need to identify alternative diagnostic modalities that can be immediately employed at the bedside of COVID-19 patients.

MethodsThis study was conducted at two medical centers in the United States from 3/21/2020-6/01/2020. Any adult who was hospitalized with COVID-19 (based on symptomatology and a confirmatory RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2) and received a pulmonary POCUS examination was included. Providers were instructed to use a 12-zone scanning protocol for pulmonary views and save 6 second clips of each lung zone. This study utilized several POCUS devices, including Butterfly IQ, Vave, Lumify, and Sonosite. The collected images were interpreted by the study researchers based on a consensus document developed by the study authors and previously accepted definitions of lung POCUS findings.

ResultsA total of 22 eligible patients who received 36 lung scans were included in our study. Eleven (50%) patients experienced clinical deterioration (defined as either ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death within 28 days from the initial symptom onset). Among the 36 lung scans collected, only 3 (8%) were classified as normal. The remaining scans had the following abnormalities: presence of B-lines (n=32, 89%), consolidations (n=20, 56%), pleural thickening (n=17, 47%), and pleural effusion (n=4, 11%). Out of 20 scans with consolidations, 14 (70%) were subpleural and 5 (25%) were translobar. A-lines were present in 26 (72%) of patients, although they were only observed in the majority of the collected lung zones in 5 (14%) of patients. Ultrasound findings were stratified by time from symptom onset to the scan based on the following time periods: early (0-6 days), middle (7-13 days), and late (14-28 days). B-lines appeared early after symptom onset and persisted well into the late disease course. In contrast, pleural thickening increased in frequency over time (early: 25%, middle: 47%, late: 67%). Subpleural consolidations also appeared in higher frequency later in the disease course (early: 13%, middle 42%, late: 56%).

Discussioncertain lung ultrasound findings may be common in Covid-19, while others may appear later in the disease course or only occur in patients who experience clinical deterioration. Future efforts should investigate the predictive utility of consolidations, pleural thickening and B-lines for clinical deterioration and compare them to traditional radiological studies such as X-rays or CTs.","Kumar, A.

3255,Forecasting the Worldwide Spread of COVID-19 based on Logistic Model and SEIR Model,"BackgroundWith the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a sudden case increase in late February 2020 led to deep concern globally. Italy, South Korea, Iran, France, Germany, Spain, the US and Japan are probably the countries with the most severe outbreaks. Collecting epidemiological data and predicting epidemic trends are important for the development and measurement of public intervention strategies. Epidemic prediction results yielded by different mathematical models are inconsistent; therefore, we sought to compare different models and their prediction results to generate objective conclusions.

MethodsWe used the number of cases reported from January 23 to March 20, 2020, to estimate the possible spread size and peak time of COVID-19, especially in 8 high-risk countries. The logistic growth model, basic SEIR model and adjusted SEIR model were adopted for prediction. Given that different model inputs may infer different model outputs, we implemented three model predictions with three scenarios of epidemic development.

ResultsWhen comparing all 8 countries short-term prediction results and peak predictions, the differences among the models were relatively large. The logistic growth model estimated a smaller epidemic size than the basic SERI model did; however, once we added parameters that considered the effects of public health interventions and control measures, the adjusted SERI model results demonstrated a considerably rapid deceleration of epidemic development. Our results demonstrated that contact rate, quarantine scale, and the initial quarantine time and length are important factors in controlling epidemic size and length.

ConclusionsWe demonstrated a comparative assessment of the predictions of the COVID-19 outbreak in eight high-risk countries using multiple methods. By forecasting epidemic size and peak time as well as simulating the effects of public health interventions, the intent of this paper is to help clarify the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and recommend operation suggestions to slow down the epidemic. It is suggested that the quick detection of cases, sufficient implementation of quarantine and public self-protection behaviors are critical to slow down the epidemic.","Zhou, X.; Ma, X.; Hong, N.; Su, L.; Ma, Y.; He, J.; Jiang, H.; Liu, C.; Shan, G.; Zhu, W.; Zhang, S.; Long, Y.",2020-04-08,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.26.20044289,2,Yun Long,Peking Union Medical College Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044289v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044289v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
6274,A note on COVID-19 seroprevalence studies: a meta-analysis using hierarchical modelling,"In recent weeks, several seroprevalence studies have appeared which attempt to determine the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the population of certain European and American locations. Many of these studies find an antibody prevalence comparable to the false positive rate of their respective serology tests and the relatively low statistical power associated with each study has invited criticism. To determine the strength of the signal, we perform a meta-analysis on the publicly available seroprevalence data based on Bayesian hierarchical modelling with Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Generalized Linear Mixed Modelling with prediction sampling. We examine studies with results from Santa Clara County (CA), Los Angeles County (CA), San Miguel County (CO), Chelsea (MA), the Comte de Geneve (Switzerland), and Gangelt (Germany). Our results are in broad agreement with the conclusions of the studies; we find that there is evidence for non-trivial levels of antibody prevalence across all study locations. However, we also find that a significant probability mass exists for antibody prevalence at levels lower than the reported figures. The results of our meta-analysis on the recent seroprevalence studies point to an important and strongly suggestive signal.","Levesque, J.; Maybury, D.

9406,Early administration of lopinavir/ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine does not alter the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a retrospective cohort study.,"As it has been shown that lopinavir (LPV) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have in vitro activity against coronaviruses, they were used to treat COVID-19 during the first wave of the epidemic in Lombardy, Italy.

The aim of this retrospective intent-to-treat analysis of the hospitalized patients who started off-label treatment with LPV/ritonavir (LPV/r)+HCQ between 21 February and 20 March 2020 was to compare the rate of clinical improvement between those who started the treatment within five days of symptom onset (early treatment, ET) and those who started later (delayed treatment, DT). The association between the timing of treatment and the probability of 30-day mortality was also assessed using uni- and multivariable logistic models.

The study involved 172 patients: 43 (25%) in the ET and 129 (75%) in the DT group. The rate of clinical improvement increased over time to 73.3% on day 30, without any significant difference between the two groups (Grays test P = 0.213). After adjusting for potentially relevant clinical variables, there was no significant association between the timing of the start of treatment and the probability of 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] ET vs DT = 1.45, 95% confidence interval 0.50-4.19). Eight percent of the patients discontinued the treatment because of severe gastrointestinal disorders attributable to LPV/r.

The timing of the start of LPV/r+HCQ treatment does not seem to affect the clinical course of hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Together with the severe adverse events attributable to LPV/r, this raises concerns about the benefit of using this combination to treat COVID-19.","Giacomelli, A.; Pagani, G.; Ridolfo, A.

15666,Using COVID-19 deaths as a surrogate to measure the progression of the pandemics.,"The IFR (Infection Fatality Risk) is one of the most important parameters of an infectious disease. If properly estimated, the observed number of deaths divided by the IFR can be used to estimate the current number of infections and, if immunity is permanent, we can estimate the fraction of susceptible which can be used to plan reopening of activities and vaccine deployment, when these become available. Here we suggest how to use the observed deaths by COVID-19 in an arbitrary population as a surrogate for the progression of the epidemic with the purpose of decision making. We compare several estimates of IFR for SARS-CoV-2 with our estimate that uses the number of additional deaths in households in a database population of 159,150 laboratory-confirmed (RT-qPCR) COVID-19 by SARS-COV-2 in Mexico. The main result is that if the number of deaths in a region is close to 2 per thousand individuals, the fraction of remaining susceptible may be too small for the vaccine to make a difference in the total number of infected.","Hernandez-Suarez, C.

8369,Forecasting COVID-19 pandemic in Poland according to government regulations and people behavior,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is a worldwide pandemic problem that started in China in December 2019 and within a few months spread to all continents. Very high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 virus and substantial disease severity caused medical care capacity shortage in many countries. Therefore, real-time epidemic forecasting of the COVID-19 is useful to plan public health strategies like country lockdown and healthcare reorganization.

We used extended susceptible-infected-removed (eSIR) model to predict the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in Poland under different scenarios of the lockdown and lockdown removal. We used time-series data of SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 4 to May 22 2020. Our forecast includes the impact of a timeline of preventive measures introduced in Poland. Using eSIR algorithm we estimated the basic reproductive number and a total number of infections under different epidemic trend scenarios.

Using eSIR modeling we estimated that the basic reproductive number in Poland concerning different scenarios of the lockdown removal is in a range of 3.91-4.79. The lowest predicted number of infected cases would be 263 900 (0 - 1 734 200, 95%CI) if the strict protective measures were maintained until the end of September. However, under different scenarios of precautions removal, a total number of infected cases may exceed one million within the next year.

Relatively early introduction of strong precautions in Poland significantly slowed down epidemic spread in Poland in comparison with other European countries like Italy or Spain. However, early removal of protective measures may result in a significant increase in infection. Data shows that the number of new COVID-19 cases in Poland beyond May 18 is linear what could be a prognosis of a duration of the epidemic exceeding 300 days.","Orzechowska, M.; Bednarek, A.

3045,Multiple-Input Deep Convolutional Neural Network Model for COVID-19 Forecasting in China,"COVID-19 is spreading all across the globe. Up until March 23, 2020, the confirmed cases in 173 countries and regions of the globe had surpassed 346,000, and more than 14,700 deaths had resulted. The confirmed cases outside of China had also reached over 81,000, with over 3,200 deaths. In this study, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was proposed to analyze and predict the number of confirmed cases. Several cities with the most confirmed cases in China were the focus of this study, and a COVID-19 forecasting model, based on the CNN deep neural network method, was proposed. To compare the overall efficacies of different algorithms, the indicators of mean absolute error and root mean square error were applied in the experiment of this study. The experiment results indicated that compared with other deep learning methods, the CNN model proposed in this study has the greatest prediction efficacy. The feasibility and practicality of the model in predicting the cumulative number of COVID-19 confirmed cases were also verified in this study.","Huang, C.-J.; Chen, Y.-H.; Ma, Y.; Kuo, P.-H.",2020-03-27,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.23.20041608,1,Ping-Huan Kuo,National Pingtung University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041608v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041608v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
3680,Epidemiological Characteristics of COVID-19: A Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis,"BackgroundOur understanding of the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to evolve. However, there are many unknowns about its epidemiology.

PurposeTo synthesize the number of deaths from confirmed COVID-19 cases, incubation period, as well as time from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to first medical visit, ICU admission, recovery and death of COVID-19.

Data SourcesMEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar from December 01, 2019 through to March 11, 2020 without language restrictions as well as bibliographies of relevant articles.

Study SelectionQuantitative studies that recruited people living with or died due to COVID-19.

Data ExtractionTwo independent reviewers extracted the data. Conflicts were resolved through discussion with a senior author.

Data SynthesisOut of 1675 non-duplicate studies identified, 57 were included. Pooled mean incubation period was 5.84 (99% CI: 4.83, 6.85) days. Pooled mean number of days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to first clinical visit was 4.82 (95% CI: 3.48, 6.15), ICU admission was 10.48 (95% CI: 9.80, 11.16), recovery was 17.76 (95% CI: 12.64, 22.87), and until death was 15.93 (95% CI: 13.07, 18.79). Pooled probability of COVID-19-related death was 0.02 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.03).

LimitationsStudies are observational and findings are mainly based on studies that recruited patient from clinics and hospitals and so may be biased toward more severe cases.

ConclusionWe found that the incubation period and lag between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 is longer than other respiratory viral infections including MERS and SARS; however, the current policy of 14 days of mandatory quarantine for everyone might be too conservative. Longer quarantine periods might be more justified for extreme cases.

9350,What does and does not correlate with COVID-19 death rates,"We correlate county-level COVID-19 death rates with key variables using both linear regression and negative binomial mixed models, although we focus on linear regression models. We include four sets of variables: socio-economic variables, county-level health variables, modes of commuting, and climate and pollution patterns. Our analysis studies daily death rates from April 4, 2020 to May 27, 2020. We estimate correlation patterns both across states, as well as within states. For both models, we find higher shares of African American residents in the county are correlated with higher death rates. However, when we restrict ourselves to correlation patterns within a given state, the statistical significance of the correlation of death rates with the share of African Americans, while remaining positive, wanes. We find similar results for the share of elderly in the county. We find that higher amounts of commuting via public transportation, relative to telecommuting, is correlated with higher death rates. The correlation between driving into work, relative to telecommuting, and death rates is also positive across both models, but statistically significant only when we look across states and counties. We also find that a higher share of people not working, and thus not commuting either because they are elderly, children or unemployed, is correlated with higher death rates. Counties with higher home values, higher summer temperatures, and lower winter temperatures have higher death rates. Contrary to past work, we do not find a correlation between pollution and death rates. Also importantly, we do not find that death rates are correlated with obesity rates, ICU beds per capita, or poverty rates. Finally, our model that looks within states yields estimates of how a given states death rate compares to other states after controlling for the variables included in our model; this may be interpreted as a measure of how states are doing relative to others. We find that death rates in the Northeast are substantially higher compared to other states, even when we control for the four sets of variables above. Death rates are also statistically significantly higher in Michigan, Louisiana, Iowa, Indiana, and Colorado. Californias death rate is the lowest across all states.

It is important to understand that this research, and other observational analyses like it, only identify correlations: these relationships are not necessarily causal. However, these correlations may help policy makers identify variables that may potentially be causally related to COVID-19 death rates and adopt appropriate policies after understanding the causal relationship.","Knittel, C.

18752,No current evidence for risk of vaccine-driven virulence evolution in SARS-CoV-2,"Vaccines that reduce clinical severity but not infection or transmission could drive the evolution of increased rates of pathogen-inflicted damage, or virulence. Preliminary evidence suggests that COVID-19 vaccines might have such differential effects, conferring greater protection in the lower respiratory tract, where viral growth most impacts severity, than in the upper respiratory tract, where infection is chiefly determined. However, the evolution of increased virulence can only occur under certain conditions, which include the existence of a positive association between transmission and severity linked to viral genetic variation. Here, we review the current evidence for these conditions, which does not point to a risk of vaccine driven virulence evolution. An evo-epidemiological model also indicates that upper respiratory tract protection can minimize or negate selection for increased virulence should these conditions be met. Despite low apparent risks, SARS-CoV-2 virulence should be monitored, and transmission-limiting characteristics should be prioritized for  second-wave vaccines.","Miller, I. F.; Metcalf, C. J.

4653,A consideration of publication-derived immune-related associations in Coronavirus and related lung damaging diseases,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome virus SARS-CoV-2, a close relative of the SARS-CoV virus, is the cause of recent COVID-19 pandemic affecting, to date, nearly 2 million individuals across the globe and demonstrating relatively high rates of infection and mortality. A third virus, the H5N1, responsible for avian influenza, has caused infection with some clinical similarities to those in COVID-19 infections.

Cytokines, small proteins that modulate immune responses, have been directly implicated in some of the severe responses seen in COVID-19 patients, e.g. cytokine storms.

Understanding the immune processes related to COVID-19, and other similar infections, could help identify diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.

Here we examine data of cytokine, immune cell types, and disease associations captured from biomedical literature associated with coronavirus, SARS, and H5N1 influenza, with the objective of identifying potentially useful relationships and areas for future research. Cytokine and cell-type associations captured from MeSH terms linked to thousands of PubMed abstracts, has identified differing patterns of associations between the three corpuses of abstracts (coronavirus, SARS, or H5N1 influenza). Clustering of cytokine-disease co-occurrences in the context of coronavirus has identified compelling clusters of co-morbidities and symptoms, some of which already known to be linked to COVID-19. Finally, network analysis identified sub-networks of cytokines and immune cell types associated with different manifestations, co-morbidities and symptoms of coronavirus, SARS, and H5N1.

Systematic review of research in medicine is essential to facilitate evidence-based choices about health interventions. In a fast moving pandemic the approach taken here will identify trends and enable rapid comparison to the literature of related diseases.","Geifman, N.; Whetton, A.

19931,Is sickle cell disease a risk factor for severe COVID-19 : a multicenter national retrospective cohort,"IntroductionCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is an infectious disease which has evolved into a worldwide pandemic. Growing evidence suggests that individuals with pre-existing comorbidities are at higher risk of a more serious COVID-19 illness. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy which increases the susceptibility to infections and as a consequent has higher risks of morbidity and mortality.

The impact of COVID-19 on SCD patients could lead to further increase in disease severity and mortality. Studies that examine the effect of SCD on COVID-19 outcomes are lacking. This study aims to determine whether SCD is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 infection in regards to the requirement of non-invasive ventilation/high flow nasal cannula (NIV/HFNC), mechanical intubation (MV) or death.

MethodsRetrospective cohort study which included COVID-19 patients admitted to four Ministry of Health COVID-19 treatment facilities in Bahrain during the period of 24, February 2020, to 31, July 2020. All SCD patients with COVID-19 were included and compared to randomly selected non-SCD patients with COVID-19. Data for the selected patients were collected from the medical records. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to control for confounders and estimate the effect of SCD on the outcomes.

ResultsA total of 1,792 patients with COVID-19 were included; 38 of whom were diagnosed with SCD as well. In the SCD group, one (2.6%) patient required NIV/HFNC, one (2.6%) required MV and one (2.6%) death occurred. In comparison, 56 (3.2%) of the non-SCD patients required NIV/HFNC, 47 (2.7%) required MV and death occurred in 58 (3.3%) patients. Upon adjusting for confounders, SCD had an odds ratio of 1.847 (95% CI: 0.39 - 8.83; p=0.442).

ConclusionOur results indicate that SCD is not a risk factor for worse disease outcomes in COVID-19 patients.","Abdulrahman, A.; Wael, M.; Alammadi, F.; Almosawi, Z.; Alsherooqi, R.; Abduljalil, M.; Kumar, N.; Alqahtani, M.",2021-01-04,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.12.30.20249053,1,Manaf Alqahtani,"Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Bahrain",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.30.20249053v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.30.20249053v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
5763,Validation of an extraction-free RT-PCR protocol for detection of SARS-CoV2 RNA,"In light of supply chain failures for reagents and consumables needed for purification of nucleic acid for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR, we aim to verify the performance and utility of a non-extraction protocol for RT-PCR (""direct RT-PCR"").

We report improved sensitivity compared to earlier reports of direct RT-PCR testing of swab samples, in particular at the lower limit of detection (sensitivity 93% overall; 100% for specimens with high to moderate viral titre, Ct <34; 81% for specimens with a low viral titre, Ct [&ge;]34). Sensitivity is improved (from 90 to 93%) by testing in duplicate. We recommend swabs are re-suspended in water to minimise PCR inhibition. A cellular target is necessary to control for PCR inhibition and specimen quality.

Direct RT-PCR is best suited to population level screening where results are not clinically actionable, however in the event of a critical supply chain failure direct RT-PCR is fit for purpose for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The results from our study offer front-line laboratories additional reagent options for performing extraction-free RT-PCR protocols.","Brown, J.

7644,Pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2: targeting of endothelial cells renders a complex disease with thrombotic microangiopathy and aberrant immune response. The Mount Sinai COVID-19 autopsy experience,"BACKGROUNDSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated clinical syndrome COVID-19 are causing overwhelming morbidity and mortality around the globe, disproportionately affecting New York City. A comprehensive, integrative autopsy series that advances the mechanistic discussion surrounding this disease process is still lacking.

METHODSAutopsies were performed at the Mount Sinai Hospital on 67 COVID-19 positive patients and data from the clinical records were obtained from the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse. The experimental design included a comprehensive microscopic examination carried out by a team of expert pathologists, along with transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, RNA in situ hybridization, as well as immunology and serology assays.

RESULTSLaboratory results of our COVID-19 cohort show elevated inflammatory markers, abnormal coagulation values, and elevated cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and TNF. Autopsies revealed large pulmonary emboli in four cases. We report microthrombi in multiple organ systems including the brain, as well as conspicuous hemophagocytosis and a secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like syndrome in many of our patients. We provide electron microscopic, immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical evidence of the presence of the virus and the ACE2 receptor in our samples.

CONCLUSIONSWe report a comprehensive autopsy series of 67 COVID-19 positive patients revealing that this disease, so far conceptualized as a primarily respiratory viral illness, also causes endothelial dysfunction, a hypercoagulable state, and an imbalance of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. Novel findings reported here include an endothelial phenotype of ACE2 in selected organs, which correlates with clotting abnormalities and thrombotic microangiopathy, addressing the prominent coagulopathy and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Another original observation is that of macrophage activation syndrome, with hemophagocytosis and a hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like disorder, underlying the microangiopathy and excessive cytokine release. We discuss the involvement of critical regulatory pathways.","Bryce, C.; Grimes, Z.; Pujadas, E.; Ahuja, S.; Beasley, M.

1724,Statistical Inference for Coronavirus Infected Patients in Wuhan,"ImportanceThe new coronavirus outbreak has seriously affected the quality of life in China. Wuhan is the disaster area, where the number of cases has increased rapidly. However, the current measures of infected patients in Wuhan are still underestimated.

ObjectiveTo estimate the overall infected patients in Wuhan from several sampled data. The correct estimated infected patients can be helpful for the government to arrange the needed beds in hospital wards to meet the actual needs.

DesignWe proposed to use the sampling survey to estimate the overall infected patients in Wuhan. The sampling survey is a kind of non-comprehensive survey. It selected some units from all the survey objects to carry out the survey and made the estimation and inference to all the survey objects. Sampling surveys can obtain information that reflects the overall situation, although it is not a comprehensive survey.

SettingWe estimated the overall infection rate in Wenzhou city, which has a better data collection system. Simultaneously, another different samples of Wuhan tourists to Singapore will be used to validate the infection rate in Wenzhou city. Combined these two samples, we give the estimation of the number of infected patients in Wuhan and other prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province.

ParticipantsThe number of people who returned from Wuhan to Wenzhou was selected from the daily notification of the pneumonia epidemic caused by a new coronavirus infection in the city.

Exposures for observational studiesThe daily rate of the pneumonia epidemic caused by the new coronavirus infection in Wenzhou City. The numerator is the number of people diagnosed and whether each person diagnosed had a history of living in Wuhan. The denominator is the total number of people returning to Wenzhou from Wuhan. Based on this rate, it is reasonable to predict the number of the infected patients.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)According to the most conservative estimate from our proposed sampling method, at least total 54,000 infected patients are in Wuhan. Therefore, the current 8,000 beds in hospital wards and the 20,000 beds in square-class hospitals are far away from meeting the actual needs.","Zhou, Y.; Dong, J.",2020-02-12,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.02.10.20021774,1,Jianghu Dong,"Department of Biostatistics, College of Public Health, University of Nebraska Medical Center, USA",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021774v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021774v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
12296,Power Law in COVID-19 Cases in China,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in China in December 2019. Within a short period of time, the infectious disease has spread far and wide. This study focuses on the distribution of COVID-19 confirmed cases in China--the original epicenter of the outbreak. We show that the upper tail of COVID-19 cases in Chinese cities is well described by a power law distribution, with exponent less than one, and that a random proportionate growth model predicated by Gibrats law is a plausible explanation for the emergence of the observed power law behavior. This finding is significant because it implies that COVID-19 cases in China is heavy-tailed and disperse, that a few cities account for a disproportionate share of COVID-19 cases, and that the distribution has no finite mean or variance. The power-law distributedness has implications for effective planning and policy design as well as efficient use of government resources.","Ahundjanov, B. B.; Akhundjanov, S. B.; Okhunjanov, B.

2478,Prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 in feces of pediatric patients during the convalescent phase,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified virus which mainly spreads from person-to-person. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 has been constantly reported in stools of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, there is a paucity of data concerning fecal shedding of the virus in pediatric patients.

ObjectiveTo investigate dynamic changes of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory and fecal specimens in children with COVID-19.

MethodsFrom January 17, 2020 to February 23, 2020, three pediatric cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data of these children were collected. Real-time fluorescence reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs and fecal specimens. Patients were followed up to March 10, 2020, the final date of follow-up, and dynamic profiles of RT-PCR results were closely monitored.

ResultsAll the three pediatric cases were household contacts of adults whose symptoms developed earlier. Severity of disease was mild to moderate and fever was the most consistent and predominant symptom at onset of illness of these children (two cases had body temperature higher than 38.5{degrees}C). All children showed increased lymphocytes (>4.4x109 /L) with normal white blood cell counts on admission. Radiological changes were not typical for COVID-19. All children showed good response to supportive treatment. Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas viral RNA remained positive in stools of pediatric patients for longer than 4 weeks. Two children had fecal SARS-CoV-2 turned negative 20 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 8 days.

InterpretationSARS-CoV-2 may exist in gastrointestinal tract for a longer time than respiratory system. Persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected children indicates the potential for the virus to be transmitted through fecal excretion. Massive efforts should be made at all levels to prevent spreading of the infection among children after reopening of kindergartens and schools.","Xing, Y.; Ni, W.; Wu, Q.; Li, W.; Li, G.; Tong, J.; Song, X.; Xing, Q.",2020-03-13,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.11.20033159,1,Quansheng Xing,Qingdao Women and Children\'s Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20033159v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20033159v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
3546,Classification of Coronavirus Images using Shrunken Features,"Necessary screenings must be performed to control the spread of the Corona Virus (COVID-19) in daily life and to make a preliminary diagnosis of suspicious cases. The long duration of pathological laboratory tests and the wrong test results led the researchers to focus on different fields. Fast and accurate diagnoses are essential for effective interventions with COVID-19. The information obtained by using X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) images is vital in making clinical diagnoses. Therefore it was aimed to develop a machine learning method for the detection of viral epidemics by analyzing X-ray images. In this study, images belonging to 6 situations, including coronavirus images, are classified. Since the number of images in the dataset is deficient and unbalanced, it is more convenient to analyze these images with hand-crafted feature extraction methods. For this purpose, firstly, all the images in the dataset are extracted with the help of four feature extraction algorithms. These extracted features are combined in raw form. The unbalanced data problem is eliminated by producing feature vectors with the SMOTE algorithm. Finally, the feature vector is reduced in size by using a stacked auto-encoder and principal component analysis to remove interconnected features in the feature vector. According to the obtained results, it is seen that the proposed method has leveraging performance, especially in order to make the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a short time and effectively.","Ozturk, S.; Ozkaya, U.; Barstugan, M.",2020-04-14,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.04.03.20048868,2,Saban Ozturk,Amasya University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20048868v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20048868v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
17626,Socio-economic disparities in social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States,"ImportanceEliminating disparities in the burden of COVID-19 requires equitable access to control measures across socio-economic groups. Limited research on socio-economic differences in mobility hampers our ability to understand whether inequalities in social distancing are occurring during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

ObjectiveTo assess how mobility patterns have varied across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, and identify associations with socio-economic factors of populations.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe used anonymized mobility data from tens of millions of devices to measure the speed and depth of social distancing at the county level between February and May 2020. Using linear mixed models, we assessed the associations between social distancing and socio-economic variables, including the proportion of people below the poverty level, the proportion of Black people, the proportion of essential workers, and the population density.

Main outcomes and ResultsWe find that the speed, depth, and duration of social distancing in the United States is heterogeneous. We particularly show that social distancing is slower and less intense in counties with higher proportions of people below the poverty level and essential workers; and in contrast, that social distancing is intense in counties with higher population densities and larger Black populations.

Conclusions and relevanceSocio-economic inequalities appear to be associated with the levels of adoption of social distancing, potentially resulting in wide-ranging differences in the impact of COVID-19 in communities across the United States. This is likely to amplify existing health disparities, and needs to be addressed to ensure the success of ongoing pandemic mitigation efforts.","Garnier, R.; Benetka, J.

19347,Risk of Stress/Depression and Functional Impairment in Denmark Immediately Following a COVID-19 Shutdown,"BackgroundThis study aimed to investigate the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown (March-April 2020) on risk for stress/depression and functional impairment in a representative sample of adult individuals in Denmark, and whether the impact of lockdown was heterogeneous across living situation.

MethodsUsing a representative, randomly drawn sample from the complete Danish adult population interviewed in March 2 to April 13, 2020 (n=2,836) and again in July 2020 (n=1,526, 54% retention rate), we study how the imposed lockdown announced March 11 following the onset of the first Danish wave of COVID-19 infections affected mental wellbeing. We use the World Health Organization Five Well-being Index (WHO-5) and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) to capture wellbeing and functioning. Using covariate adjusted ordinary least squares linear probability models and exploiting variation in the timing of responses occurring just before and just after the introduction of lockdown, we compare respondents before lockdown to respondents that answered during lockdown, as well to answers in re-interviews in July.

ResultsWe find reduced depressive symptoms among adults immediately after the shutdown, concentrated in adults with children living at home. Measures of functional impairment also decline immediately after the March shutdown among adults with children living at home. Impairment intensified for the entire sample between March and July, but depressive symptoms remained at lower rate in July.

ConclusionsFindings in Denmark indicate that living with children at home may have, in the short term, buffered the potential mental health sequelae of the COVID-19 shutdown.","Andersen, L.

9973,Extrapolation of Infection Data for the CoVid-19 Virus in 21 Countries and States and Estimate of the Efficiency of Lock Down.,"Predictions about the further development of the Corona pandemic are of great public interest but many approaches demand a large number of country specific parameters and are not easily transferable. A special interest of simulations on the pandemic is to trace the effect of politics for reducing the virus spread, since these measures have had an enormous impact on economy and daily life.

Here a simple yet powerful algorithm is introduced for fitting the infection numbers by simple analytic functions. This way, the increase of the case numbers in periods with different regulations can be distinguished, and by extrapolating the fit functions, a forecast for the maximum numbers and time scales are possible. The effect of the restraints such as lock down are demonstrated by comparing the resulting infection history with the likely unconstrained virus spread, and it is shown that a delay of 1-4 weeks before imposing measures aiming at social distancing could have led to a complete infection of the respective populations.

The approach is simply transferable to many different states. Here data from six E.U. countries, the UK, Russia, two Asian countries, the USA and ten states inside the USA with significant case numbers are analyzed, and striking qualitative similarities are found.

3262,Effects of temperature on COVID-19 transmission,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China and has resulted in the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic. As of March 1, 2020, 79,968 patients in China and 7169 outside of China had tested positive for COVID-19 and a mortality rate of 3.6% has been observed amongst Chinese patients. Its primary mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes. The virus can remain viable for up to three days on plastic and stainless steel or in aerosols for upto 3 hours and is relatively more stable than the known human coronaviruses. It is stable in faeces at room temperature for at least 1-2 days and can be stable in infected patients for up to 4 days. Heat at 56{degrees}C kills the SARS coronavirus at around 10000 units per 15 minutes. Thus, temperature is an important factor in survival of COVID-19 virus and this article focuses on understanding the relationship between temperature and COVID-19 transmission from the data available between January-March 2020.","Pawar, S.; Stanam, A.; Chaudhari, M.; Rayudu, D.",2020-03-30,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.29.20044461,1,Shrikant Pawar,Yale University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.20044461v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.20044461v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
20565,Learning from pandemics: using extraordinary events can improve disease now-casting models,"Online searches have been used to study different health-related behaviours, including monitoring disease outbreaks. An obvious caveat is that several reasons can motivate individuals to seek online information and models that are blind to peoples motivations are of limited use and can even mislead. This is particularly true during extraordinary public health crisis, such as the ongoing pandemic, when fear, curiosity and many other reasons can lead individuals to search for health-related information, masking the disease-driven searches. However, health crisis can also offer an opportunity to disentangle between different drivers and learn about human behavior. Here, we focus on the two pandemics of the 21st century (2009-H1N1 flu and Covid-19) and propose a methodology to discriminate between search patterns linked to general information seeking (media driven) and search patterns possibly more associated with actual infection (disease driven). We show that by learning from such pandemic periods, with high anxiety and media hype, it is possible to select online searches and improve model performance both in pandemic and seasonal settings. Moreover, and despite the common claim that more data is always better, our results indicate that lower volume of the right data can be better than including large volumes of apparently similar data, especially in the long run. Our work provides a general framework that can be applied beyond specific events and diseases, and argues that algorithms can be improved simply by using less (better) data. This has important consequences, for example, to solve the accuracy-explainability trade-off in machine-learning.","Mesquita, S.; Vieira, C.

ObjectiveSummarize the prevalence adverse outcomes, risk factors, and association of risk factors with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe searched Medline, Embase and Web of Science for case-series and observational studies of hospitalized COVID-19 patients through May 22, 2020. Data were analyzed by fixed-effects meta-analysis, using Shores adjusted confidence intervals to address heterogeneity.

ResultsForty-four studies comprising 20594 hospitalized patients met inclusion criteria; 12591 from the US-Europe and 7885 from China. Pooled prevalence of death [%(95% CI)] was 18% (15-22%). Of those that died, 76% were aged[&ge;] 60 years, 68% were males, and 63%, 38%, and 29% had hypertension, diabetes and heart disease, respectively. The case fatality risk [%(95% CI)] were 62% (48-78) for heart disease, 51% (36-71) for COPD, and 42% (34-50) for age[&ge;] 60 years and 49% (33-71) for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Summary relative risk (sRR) of death were higher for age[&ge;] 60 years [sRR=3.8; 95% CI: 2.9-4.8; n=12 studies], males [1.3; 1.2-1.5; 17], smoking history [1.9; 1.1-3.3; n=6], COPD [2.0; 1.6-2.4; n=9], hypertension [1.8; 1.7-2.0; n=14], diabetes [1.5; 1.4-1.7; n=16], heart disease [2.0; 1.7-2.4; 16] and CKD [2.0; 1.3-3.1; 8]. The overall prevalence of hypertension (55%), diabetes (31%) and heart disease (16%) among COVODI-19 patients in the US were substantially higher than the general US population.

3897,Variation in False Negative Rate of RT-PCR Based SARS-CoV-2 Tests by Time Since Exposure,"SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR based tests are being used to ""rule out"" infection among high-risk individuals such as exposed inpatients and healthcare workers. It is critical to understand how the predictive value of the test varies with time from exposure and symptom onset in order to avoid being falsely reassured by negative tests. As such, the goal of our study was to estimate the false negative rate by day since infection. We used previously published data on RT-PCR sensitivity on samples derived from nasal swabs by day since symptom onset (n=633) and fit a cubic polynomial spline to calculate the false negative rate by day since exposure and symptom onset. Over the four days of infection prior to the typical time of symptom onset (day 5) the probability of a false negative test in an infected individual falls from 100% on day one (95% CI 69-100%) to 61% on day four (95% CI 18-98%), though there is considerable uncertainty in these numbers. On the day of symptom onset, the median false negative rate was 39% (95% CI 16-77%). This decreased to 26% (95% CI 18-34%) on day 8 (3 days after symptom onset), then began to rise again, from 27% (95% CI 20-34%) on day 9 to 61% (95% CI 54-67%) on day 21. Care must be taken when interpreting RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly if performed early in the course of infection, when using these results as a basis for removing precautions intended to prevent onward transmission. If there is high clinical suspicion, patients should not be ruled out on the basis of RT-PCR alone, and the clinical and epidemiologic situation should be carefully considered.","Kucirka, L.; Lauer, S.; Laeyendecker, O.; Boon, D.; Lessler, J.",2020-04-10,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.07.20051474,1,Lauren Kucirka,Johns Hopkins School of Medicine,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20051474v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20051474v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
7053,The Evaluation of Deep Neural Networks and X-Ray as a Practical Alternative for Diagnosis and Management of COVID-19,"High-resolution computed tomography radiology is a critical tool in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 infection; however, in smaller clinics around the world, there is a shortage of radiologists available to analyze these images. In this paper, we compare the performance of 16 available deep learning algorithms to help identify COVID19. We utilize an already existing diagnostic technology (X-ray) and an already existing neural network (ResNet-50) to diagnose COVID-19. Our approach eliminates the extra time and resources needed to develop new technology and associated algorithm, thus aiding the front-line in the race against the COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that ResNet-50 is the optimal pretrained neural network for the detection of COVID-19, using three different cross-validation ratios, based on training time, accuracy, and network size. We also present a custom visualization of the results that can be used to highlight important visual biomarkers of the disease and disease progression.","Elgendi, M.; Fletcher, R.; Howard, N.; Menon, C.; Ward, R.",2020-05-16,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.05.12.20099481,1,Mohamed Elgendi,University of British Columbia,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20099481v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20099481v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
4908,Saliva is more sensitive for SARS-CoV-2 detection in COVID-19 patients than nasopharyngeal swabs,"Rapid and accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing is essential for controlling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The current gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is real-time RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Low sensitivity, exposure risks to healthcare workers, and global shortages of swabs and personal protective equipment, however, necessitate the validation of new diagnostic approaches. Saliva is a promising candidate for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics because (1) collection is minimally invasive and can reliably be self-administered and (2) saliva has exhibited comparable sensitivity to nasopharyngeal swabs in detection of other respiratory pathogens, including endemic human coronaviruses, in previous studies. To validate the use of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection, we tested nasopharyngeal and saliva samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients and self-collected samples from healthcare workers on COVID-19 wards. When we compared SARS-CoV-2 detection from patient-matched nasopharyngeal and saliva samples, we found that saliva yielded greater detection sensitivity and consistency throughout the course of infection. Furthermore, we report less variability in self-sample collection of saliva. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that saliva is a viable and more sensitive alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs and could enable at-home self-administered sample collection for accurate large-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing.","Wyllie, A.

19489,Excess deaths among Latino people in California during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BackgroundLatino people in the US are experiencing higher excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic than any other racial/ethnic group, but it is unclear which subgroups within this diverse population are most affected. Such information is necessary to target policies that prevent further excess mortality and reduce inequities.

MethodsUsing death certificate data for January 1, 2016 through February 29, 2020 and time-series models, we estimated the expected weekly deaths among Latino people in California from March 1 through October 3, 2020. We quantified excess mortality as observed minus expected deaths and risk ratios (RR) as the ratio of observed to expected deaths. We considered subgroups defined by age, sex, place of birth, education, occupation, and combinations of these factors.

FindingsDuring the first seven months of the pandemic, Latino deaths in California exceeded expected deaths by 10,316, a 31% increase. Excess death rates were greatest for individuals born in Mexico (RR 1.44; 95% PI, 1.41, 1.48) or Central America (RR 1.49; 95% PI, 1.37, 1.64), with less than a high school degree (RR 1.41; 95% PI, 1.35, 1.46), or in food-and-agriculture (RR 1.60; 95% PI, 1.48, 1.74) or manufacturing occupations (RR 1.59; 95% PI, 1.50, 1.69). Immigrant disadvantages in excess death were magnified among working-age Latinos in essential occupations.

InterpretationThe pandemic has disproportionately impacted mortality among Latino immigrants and Latinos in unprotected essential jobs; Interventions to reduce these disparities should include early vaccination, workplace safety enforcement, and expanded access to medical care.

FundingNational Institute on Aging; UCSF

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSeveral articles have suggested all-cause excess mortality estimates are superior to official COVID-19 counts for assessing the impact of the pandemic on marginalized populations that lack access to testing and healthcare. We searched PubMed, Google scholar, and the medRxiv preprint database through December 22, 2020 for studies of (""excess mortality"" or ""excess death"") AND (""COVID-19"" or ""coronavirus"") set in the United States and we identified two empirical studies with estimates of excess mortality among Latinos during the pandemic. The study set in California (from our research team) found per capita excess mortality was highest among Black and Latino people. The national study found percent excess mortality was significantly higher among Latino people than any other racial/ethnic group. Neither study further disaggregated the diverse Latino population or provided subgroup estimates to clarify why excess pandemic mortality is so high in this population. In the U.S., official COVID-19 statistics are rarely disaggregated by place of birth, education, or occupation which has resulted in a lack of evidence of how these factors have impacted mortality during the pandemic. No study to date of excess mortality in the U.S. has provided estimates for immigrant or occupational subgroups.

Added value of this studyOur population-based observational study of all-cause mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic provides the first estimates of within-group heterogeneity among the Latino population in California - one of the populations hardest hit by COVID-19 in the U.S. We provide the first subgroup estimates by place of birth and occupational sector, in addition to combined estimates by foreign-birth and participation in an essential job and education. In doing so, we reveal that Latino immigrants in essential occupations have the highest risk of excess death during the pandemic among working-age Latinos. We highlight the heightened risk of excess mortality associated with food/agriculture and manufacturing occupational sectors, essential sectors in which workers may lack COVID-19 protections.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study revealed stark disparities in excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic among Latinos, pointing to the particularly high vulnerability of Latino immigrants and Latinos in essential jobs. These findings may offer insight into the disproportionate COVID-19 mortality experienced by immigrants or similarly marginalized groups in other contexts. Interventions to reduce these disparities should include policies enforcing occupational safety, especially for immigrant workers, early vaccination, and expanded access to medical care.","Riley, A.

7685,Almitrine as a non ventilatory strategy to improve intrapulmonary shunt in COVID-19 patients,"In severe COVID-19 pulmonary failure, hypoxia is mainly related to pulmonary vasodilation with altered hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). Besides prone positioning, other non-ventilatory strategies may reduce the intrapulmonary shunt. This study has investigated almitrine, a pharmacological option to improve oxygenation.

Patients and Method. A case control series of 17 confirmed COVID-19 mechanically ventilated patients in prone or supine positioning was collected: 10 patients received two doses of almitrine (4 and 12 mcg/kg/min) at 30-45 min interval each, and were compared to 7 ""control"" COVID-matched patients conventionally treated. The end-point was the reduction of intra-pulmonary shunt increasing the PaO2 and ScvO2.

Results Patients were male (59%) with median (25th, 75th percentiles) age of 70 (54-78) years and a BMI of 29 (23-34). At stable mechanical ventilatory settings, PaO2 (mmHg) at FiO2 1 (135 (85, 195) to 214 (121, 275); p = 0.06) tended to increase with almitrine. This difference was significant when the best PaO2 between the 2 doses was used: 215 (123,294) vs baseline (p = 0.01). A concomitant increase in ScvO2 occurred ((73 (72, 76) to 82 (80, 87); p = 0.02). Eight over 10 almitrine-treated patients increased their PaO2, with no clear dose-effect. During the same time, the controls did not change PaO2.

In conclusion, in early COVID-19 with severe hypoxemia, almitrine infusion is associated with improved oxygenation in prone or supine positioning. This pharmacological intervention may offer an alternative and/or an additional effect to proning and might delay or avoid more demanding modalities such as ECMO.","Losser, M.

20345,"Modeling the COVID-19 transmission in Italy: The roles of asymptomatic cases, social distancing, and lockdowns","The SEIR model of COVID-19 is developed to investigate the roles of physical distancing, lockdowns and asymptomatic cases in Italy. In doing so, two types of policies including behavioral measures and lockdown measures are embedded in the model. Compared with existing models, the model successfully reproduces similar multiple observed outputs such as infected and recovered patients in Italy by July 2020. This study concludes that the first policy is important once the number of infected cases is relatively low. However, once the number of infected cases is very high so the society cannot identify infected and disinfected people, the second policy must be applied soon. It is thus this study suggests that relaxed lockdowns lead to the second wave of the COVID-19 around the world. It is hoped that the model can enhance our understanding on the roles of behavioral measures, lockdowns, and undocumented cases, so-called asymptomatic cases, on the COVID-19 flow.","Khairulbahri, M.",2021-01-14,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.01.08.21249273,1,Muhamad Khairulbahri,Bandung Institute of Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.08.21249273v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.08.21249273v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
10765,A genome epidemiological study of SARS-CoV-2 introduction into Japan,"BackgroundAfter the first case of COVID-19 in Japan on 15 January 2020, multiple nationwide COVID-19 clusters were identified by the end of February. The Japanese government focused on mitigating emerging COVID-19 clusters by conducting active nationwide epidemiological surveillance. However, an increasing number of cases appeared until early April, many with unclear infection routes exhibiting no recent history of travel outside Japan. We aimed to evaluate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome sequences from COVID-19 cases until early April and characterise the genealogical networks to demonstrate possible routes of spread in Japan.

MethodsNasopharyngeal specimens were collected from patients and a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed. Positive RNA samples were subjected whole genome sequencing and a haplotype network analysis was performed.

FindingsSome of the primary clusters identified during January and February in Japan directly descended from Wuhan-Hu-1-related isolates in China and other distinct clusters. Clusters were almost contained until mid-March; the haplotype network analysis demonstrated that COVID-19 cases from late March through early April may have caused an additional large cluster related to the outbreak in Europe, leading to additional spread within Japan. National self-restraint during February was effective in mitigating the COVID-19 spread, but late action on stopping immigration and declaring national emergency in Japan might be involved in the later increase in cases.

InterpretationGenome surveillance suggested that at least two distinct SARS-CoV-2 introductions from China and other countries occurred.

4697,Proteome-wide analysis of differentially-expressed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in early COVID-19 infection,"Rapid and accurate tests that detect IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 proteins are essential in slowing the spread of COVID-19 by identifying patients who are infected with COVID-19. Using a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray developed in our lab, we comprehensively profiled both IgM and IgG antibodies in forty patients with early-stage COVID-19, influenza, or non-influenza who had similar symptoms. The results revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is not an ideal biomarker for COVID-19 diagnosis because of its low immunogenicity, thus tests that rely on this marker alone will have a high false negative rate. Our data further suggest that the S protein subunit 1 receptor binding domain (S1-RBD) might be the optimal antigen for IgM antibody detection, while the S protein extracellular domain (S1+S2ECD) would be the optimal antigen for both IgM and IgG antibody detection. Notably, the combination of all IgM and IgG biomarkers can identify 87% and 73.3% COVID-19 patients, respectively. Finally, the COVID-19-specific antibodies are significantly correlated with the clinical indices of viral infection and acute myocardial injury (p[&le;]0.05). Our data may help understand the function of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and improve serology tests for rapid COVID-19 screening.","Zhang, X.; Wu, X.; Wang, D.; Lu, M.; Hou, X.; Wang, H.; Liang, T.; Dai, J.; Duan, H.; Xu, Y.; Li, Y.; Yu, X.",2020-05-02,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.14.20064535,2,Xiaobo Yu,"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20064535v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20064535v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

5192,"An Adaptive, Interacting, Cluster-Based Model Accurately Predicts the Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19","The SARS-CoV-2 driven disease, COVID-19, is presently a pandemic with increasing human and monetary costs. COVID-19 has put an unexpected and inordinate degree of pressure on healthcare systems of strong and fragile countries alike. In order to launch both containment and mitigation measures, each country requires accurate estimates of COVID-19 incidence as such preparedness allows agencies to plan efficient resource allocation and design control strategies. Here, we have developed a new adaptive, interacting, and cluster-based mathematical model to predict the granular trajectory COVID-19. We have analyzed incidence data from three currently afflicted countries of Italy, the United States of America, and India, and show that our approach predicts state-wise COVID-19 spread for each country with high accuracy. We show that R0 as the basic reproduction number exhibits significant spatial and temporal variation in these countries. However, by including a new function for temporal variation of R0 in an adaptive fashion, the predictive model provides highly reliable estimates of asymptomatic and undetected COVID-19 patients, both of which are key players in COVID-19 transmission. Our dynamic modeling approach can be applied widely and will provide a new fillip to infectious disease management strategies worldwide.","Ravinder, R.; Singh, S.; Bishnoi, S.; Jan, A.; Sinha, A.; Sharma, A.; Kodamana, H.; Krishnan, N.

Here we analyzed searches related to smell loss and taste loss, recently linked to COVID-19, as well as sight loss and hearing loss, not included in the COVID-19 symptoms list. Google Trends results per region (Italy) or state (United States) over several weeks were compared to the number of new cases prevalence in that geographical area. Taste and smell loss searches were correlated with each other, and, during a limited time window, with new COVID-19 cases. However, this correlation decreased with time, attributable, at least in part, to media coverage. As new symptoms are being discovered for COVID-19 and the pandemic continues to spread around the globe, the lesson learned here, that correlation between public interest in novel symptoms of infectious disease has an initial spike (the ""surprise rise"") and subsequently goes to a new baseline due to ""knowledge saturation"", is of general and practical value for the public.","Asseo, K.; Fierro, F.; Slavutsky, Y.; Frasnelli, J.; Niv, M.

20930,Home-based management of COVID-19 by identification of low-risk features,"BackgroundCovid-19 is a triphasic disorder characterized by a viral phase lasting 7-10 days from onset of symptoms. In approximately 20% it is followed by a second stage heralded by elevation of pro- inflammatory markers such as ferritin, IL-6, CRP, LDH and D-dimers. We hypothesized that those with few abnormalities would have a low risk for progression to respiratory insufficiency and hence could be monitored at home without treatment.

MethodsInclusion criteria included Covid infection, age >21, Oxygen saturation >90%. To be observed without treatment, patients could have no more than 1 of the following: CRP > 10 mg/dL, high LDH, ferritin > 500 ng/ml, D-dimer > 1 mg/L, IL-6 > 10 pg/ml, absolute lymphocyte count <1,000, Oxygen saturation <94%, or CT chest evidence of pneumonia. Primary endpoint was progression to respiratory failure and secondary endpoints was 28-day survival.

ResultsOf 208 entered, 132 were low-risk and hence were monitored without therapy. None progressed to respiratory failure or died.

ConclusionsWe have shown that our approach can identify cases who can safely be observed without treatment, thus avoiding expensive, potentially toxic therapies, and circumventing unnecessary, costly hospitalizations. These results support our hypothesis that applying our criteria, 64% of Covid-19 cases can be monitored as outpatients without therapy.

What is already known about this subjectO_LICOVID-19 is a triphasic disorder first typified by an infectious or viral phase that lasts from the first onset of symptoms until 7-10 days later. This is followed by a second phase considered as the inflammatory stage, characterized initially by the appearance of lung infiltrates which is followed in some cases by hypoxemia.
C_LIO_LIApproximately 80% of patients never proceed to the second phase but currently there is no reliable and objective method to accurately predict those that are cured spontaneously without any treatment and who could be managed at home.

What this study addsO_LIWe have developed an approach, based essentially on blood-based inflammatory markers which identifies low-risk cases that do not require therapy and can be managed at home. This method showed an excellent correlation with clinical outcome and has encouraging financial and psychological effects.
C_LIO_LIOf 208 patients, 132, fulfilled criteria for low-risk disease that justified monitoring at home without therapy and none of these developed respiratory failure or any other significant complication.
C_LIO_LIIncluded in this low-risk group were many cases with comorbidities, with COVID-19 pneumonia, as well as patients older than 65 and with more than two symptoms at presentation. These characteristics would usually portend an unfavourable prognosis, yet all these patients had an excellent outcome.

7999,Modeling the dynamics of COVID-19 using Q-SEIR model with age-stratified infection probability,"We explore the advantage of age-stratifying the population as an improvement on the quarantine-modified SEIR model. We hypothesize that this would project lower cases of infection for the Philippines because of our countrys low median age. We introduce the variable U that is multiplied to the incubation rate{sigma} when exposed individuals become infected. U is the dot product of the proxy infection probabilities stratified per age group (F) and the population stratified per age group (P) divided by the total population, similar to calculating mathematical expectation. Proxies were taken from two data sets: Hubei, China with a calculated value of UCHN = 0.4447 and Quezon City, Philippines with UQC = 0.5074. When the majority age group, represented by the median age, is far from the age group with the highest number of infections the number of infected individuals decreases and produces a delayed peaking effect. This new method gives a much lower estimate on peak number of infected cases by 65.2% compared with age-stratification alone; and by 75.2% compared with Q-SEIR alone.","Rayo, J.

8697,"Covid-19 testing strategies and lockdowns: the European closed curves, analysed by ``skew-normal'' distributions, the forecasts for the UK, Sweden, and the USA, and  the ongoing outbreak in Brazil.","As the number of Covid-19 infections worldwide overtakes 6 millions of Total Confirmed Cases (TCC), the data reveal almost closed outbreaks in many European countries. Using the European data as a basis for our analysis, we study the spreading rate of Covid-19 and model the Daily Confirmed Cases and Deaths per Million (DCCpM and DDpM) curves by using ""skew-normal"" probability density functions. The use of these asymmetrical distributions allows to get a more realistic prediction of the end of the disease in each country and to evaluate the effectiveness of the local authorities strategies in facing the European outbreak. The initial stage of the Brazilian disease is compared with the early phase of the European one. This is done by using the weekly spreading rate of Covid-19. For Sweden, UK, and USA, we shall give a forecast for the end of pandemic and for Brazil the prediction of the peak of DDpM. We also discuss additional factors that could play an important role in the fight against Covid-19, such as the fast response of the local authorities, the testing strategies, the number of beds in the intensive care units, and, last but not least, the measures of isolation adopted. The Brazilian mitigation measures can be placed between the strict lockdown of many European countries and the Swedish approach, but clearly much comparable to the European ones (in particular to the Netherlands).

MethodsFor Brazil, the weekly spreading rates of Covid-19, as more people are getting infected, was used to compare the outbreak in these countries with the ones of the European countries when they were at the same stage of infection. In the early stage of the disease, normal distributions have been used to obtain what we call a dynamic prediction of the peaks. After reaching the peak of daily infections and/or deaths, skew-normal distributions are required to correctly fit the asymmetrical DCCpM and DDpM curves and get a realistic forecast of the pandemic end.

FindingsThe European data analysis shows that the spreading rate of Covid-19 increased similarly for all countries in its initial stage, but it changed as the number of TCCpM in each country grew. This was caused by the different timely action of the authorities in adopting isolation measures and/or massive testing strategies. The early stage of the outbreak in the USA and Brazil shows for their  factor (DCCpM) a behaviour similar to Italy and Sweden, respectively. For the {beta} factor (DDpM), the American spreading is similar to the one of Switzerland, whereas the Brazilian factor is greater than the ones of Portugal, Germany, and Austria (which showed, in terms of TDpM, the best results in Europe) but, at the moment, it is lower than the other European countries.

InterpretationThe fitting skew parameters used to model the DCCpM and DDpM curves allow a more realistic prediction of the end of the pandemic and give us the possibility to compare the mitigation measures adopted by the local authorities by analysing their respective skew normal parameters (mean, mode, standard deviation, and skewness). In Europe, Sweden and the UK show the greatest asymmetries, a kind of marathon instead of the sprint of other European countries (as observed by Swedish authorities). This also happens for the USA. The Brazilian weekly spreading rate for deaths is lower than most of the European countries at the same stage of the outbreak.

2755,Estimating Preventable COVID19 Infections Related to Elective Outpatient Surgery in Washington State: A Quantitative Model,"BackgroundAs the number of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases in the US continues to rise, the US surgeon general, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and several specialty societies have issued recommendations to consider canceling elective surgeries. However, these recommendations have also faced controversy and opposition.

MethodsUsing previously published information and publicly available data on COVID-19 infections, we calculated a transmission rate and generated a mathematical model to predict a lower bound for the number of healthcare-acquired COVID-19 infections that could be prevented by canceling or postponing elective outpatient surgeries in Washington state.

ResultsOur model predicts that over the course of 30 days, at least 75.9 preventable patient infections and at least 69.3 preventable healthcare worker (HCW) infections would occur in WA state alone if elective outpatient procedures were to continue as usual.

ConclusionCanceling elective outpatient surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic could prevent a large number of patient and healthcare worker infections.","Zhang, Y.; Cheng, S.-R.",2020-03-27,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.18.20037952,2,Sheng-Ru Cheng,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.18.20037952v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.18.20037952v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
14157,The evolution of COVID-19 in Italy after the spring of 2020: an unpredicted summer respite followed by a second wave,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic was particularly invasive in Italy during the period of March to the end of April 2020 then displayed a significant decrease both in the number of infections and in the seriousness of illness throughout the summer of 2020. In this discussion, we measure the seriousness of the disease by the ratio of Intensive Care Units (ICU) spaces occupied by COVID-19 patients and the number of still Active Cases (AC) each month from April to August 2020. We also use the ratio between the number of Deaths (D) and the number of Active Cases. What clearly emerges, from rigorous statistical analysis, is a progressive decrease of both the ratios, indicating progressive mitigation of the disease. This is particularly evident when comparing March-April with July-August; during the summer period the two ratios have become roughly 18 times lower. We test such sharp decreases against possible bias in counting active cases, and we confirm their statistical significance. We then interpret such evidence in terms of the well-known seasonality of the human immune system and the virus-inactivating effect of stronger UV rays in the summer.","De Natale, G.; De Natale, L.; Troise, C.; Somma, R.; Marchitelli, V.; Coviello, A.; Holmberg, K.",2020-10-30,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.29.20184127,3,Giuseppe De Natale,"INGV, Osservatorio Vesuviano, 80124 Naples, Italy",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.29.20184127v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.29.20184127v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3390/ijerph17238708
17573,"Community health worker knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19: learnings from an online cross-sectional survey using a digital health platform, UpSCALE, in Mozambique","Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the frontline of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic response, yet there is a paucity of literature on their knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) in relation to the pandemic. Community Health Workers (CHWs) in Mozambique are known locally as agentes polivalentes elementares (APEs). While technical guidance surrounding COVID-19 is available to support APEs, communicating this information has been challenging due to restrictions on travel, face-to-face group meetings and training, imposed from May to August 2020. A digital health platform, upSCALE, that already supports 1,213 APEs and 299 supervisors across three provinces, is being used to support APEs on effective COVID-19 management by delivering COVID-19 sensitive SMS messages, training modules and a COVID-19 KAP survey.

The KAP survey, conducted from June 2020 to August 2020, consisted of 10 questions. Of 1,065 active upSCALE APEs, 28 percent completed the survey. Results indicate that only a small proportion of APEs listed the correct COVID-19 symptoms, transmission routes and appropriate prevention measures (25 percent, 16 percent and 39 percent, respectively) specifically included in national health education materials. Misconceptions were mainly related to transmission routes, high risk individuals and asymptomatic patients. 84 percent said they followed all government prevention guidelines. The results from the KAP survey were used to support the rapid development and deployment of targeted COVID-19 awareness and education materials for the APEs. SMS messages were continually adjusted based on the KAP survey results and a series of seven COVID-19 training modules were developed and disseminated. A follow-up KAP survey is planned for November 2020.

Adapting the existing upSCALE platform enabled a better understanding, in real time, of the KAP of APEs around COVID-19 management. Subsequently, supported improved delivery of tailored messages and education, vital for ensuring a successful COVID-19 response.","Feldman, M.; Lacey Krylova, V.; Farrow, P.; Donovan, L.; Zandamela, E.; Rebelo, J.; Rodrigues, M.; Bulo, A.; Ferraz, C.; Romero Gonzalez, J.; Rodrigues, H.; Roca-Feltrer, A.; Baker, K.",2020-11-06,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.11.05.20216606,1,Kevin Baker,Malaria Consortium,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.05.20216606v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.05.20216606v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
20566,NEWS2 and laboratory predictors correlated with clinical deterioration in hospitalised patients with COVID-19,"BackgroundWe aimed to determine prognostic values of NEWS2 and laboratory parameters during the first week of COVID-19.

MethodsAll adult patients who were hospitalized for a confirmed COVID-19 between the 11th of March and the 11th of May 2020 were retrospectively included. To evaluate the factors in prognosis which are admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and in-hospital death, univariate logistic regression analysis was performed at admission (D0), at day-3 (D3), day-5 (D5), and day-7 (D7). Additionally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed.

ResultsOverall, 611 patients were included. Clinical deterioration was observed in 79 (12.9%) patients during hospitalisation, 36 (5.9%) during the first three days, 54 (8.8%) during the first five days, and 62 (10.1%) during the first week of hospitalisation. Our results showed that NEWS2, procalcitonin, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and albumin were the best predictors for clinical deterioration at D0, D3, D5, and D7. Procalcitonin had the highest odds ratio for clinical deterioration on all days in univariate analysis. ROC analyses showed that NEWS2 at D7, procalcitonin at D5, albumin at D7, and NLR at D5 had highest AUC values. Additionally, we detected a strong correlation between NEWS2 and laboratory parameters including neutrophil, lymphocyte, NLR, platelet/lymphocyte ratio, CRP, procalcitonin, ferritin, and urea on all days.

ConclusionThis study provides a list of several laboratory parameters correlated with NEWS2 and potential predictors for ICU admission or in-hospital death during the clinical course of COVID-19.

5845,Variation among states in reducing coronavirus spread: impact of stay-at-home orders,"The corona virus, COVID-19, has been spreading rapidly across the USA since early March, but at a decreasing rate, where the rate r is defined as the exponential increase. I modeled the way the rate of increase y = log(exp(r)-1) has declined through time in each of the 51 states with the goal of determining whether state-at-home orders correlate with reductions in the rate of spread of the virus. A piecewise linear regression was used, with a single break point. This model can identify whether there was a change in the rate of decline, when the change happened, and which states have shown the greatest improvement in reducing the spread of COVID-19. The piecewise model identified a significant breakpoint on 24 Mar for all states combined, and all states had nearly the same breakpoint. Prior to 24 Mar, the average change in y was -0.013 per day, meaning a reduction in the rate of spread from 23.5 pct. per day to 19.5 pct. per day; after 24 Mar, the average change in y was -0.070 per day, a reduction from 19.5 pct. per day to 7.5 pct. per day. Prior to 24 Mar there was no significant variation among states in the decline in y, but after 24 Mar there was substantial variation, and the date on which states issued stay at home orders correlated with that variation. Montana, Idaho, and Vermont showed the greatest improvement, while Nebraska, South Dakota, and Iowa the least. The improvement as measured by the reduction after 24 Mar did not correlate with case density in a state, nor state population.","Condit, R.",2020-05-12,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.27.20081752,2,Richard Condit,Retired,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.27.20081752v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.27.20081752v2.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
17571,Evaluation of a home-based 7-day infection control strategy for healthcare workers following high-risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2: a cohort study,"BackgroundEvidence-based infection control strategies are needed for healthcare workers (HCWs) following high-risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2. This study evaluated the negative predictive value (NPV) of a home-based 7-day infection control strategy.

MethodsHCWs advised by their Infection Control or Occupational Health officer to self-isolate due to a high-risk SARS-CoV-2 exposure were enrolled between May-September 2020. The strategy consisted of symptom-triggered nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing from day 0-6 post exposure, followed by standardized home-based nasopharyngeal swab and saliva testing on day 7. The NPV of this strategy was calculated for i) clinical COVID-19 diagnosis from day 8-14 post exposure, and for ii) asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 detected by standardized nasopharyngeal swab and saliva specimens collected at days 9-10 and 14 post exposure. Interim results are reported in the context of a second wave threatening this essential workforce.

ResultsAmong 30 HCWs enrolled to date (age 31{+/-}9 years, 24 [80.0%] female), 3 were diagnosed with COVID-19 by day 14 post exposure (secondary attack rate 10.0%), with all cases detected by the 7-day infection control strategy: NPV for subsequent clinical COVID-19 or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 detection by day 14 was 100.0% (95%CI: 93.1-100.0%).

InterpretationAmong HCWs with high-risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2, a home-based 7-day infection control strategy may have a high NPV for subsequent COVID-19 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 detection. While ongoing data collection and data sharing are needed to improve the precision of the estimated NPV, we report interim results to inform infection control strategies in light of a second wave threatening this essential workforce.","Benea, C.; Rendon, L.; Papenburg, J.; Frenette, C.; Imcaoudene, A.; Mcdonald, E.; Nguyen, Q.

4069,"Prediction of the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients using T lymphocyte subsets with 340 cases from Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study and a web visualization tool","BackgroundWuhan, China was the epicenter of the 2019 coronavirus outbreak. As a designated hospital, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital has received over 700 COVID-19 patients. With the COVID-19 becoming a pandemic all over the world, we aim to share our epidemiological and clinical findings with the global community.

MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, we studied 340 confirmed COVID-19 patients from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, including 310 discharged cases and 30 death cases. We analyzed their demographic, epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data and implemented our findings into an interactive, free access web application.

FindingsBaseline T lymphocyte Subsets differed significantly between the discharged cases and the death cases in two-sample t-tests: Total T cells (p < 2{middle dot}2e-16), Helper T cells (p < 2{middle dot}2e-16), Suppressor T cells (p = 1{middle dot}8-14), and TH/TS (Helper/Suppressor ratio, p = 0{middle dot}0066). Multivariate logistic regression model with death or discharge as the outcome resulted in the following significant predictors: age (OR 1{middle dot}05, p 0{middle dot}04), underlying disease status (OR 3{middle dot}42, p 0{middle dot}02), Helper T cells on the log scale (OR 0{middle dot}22, p 0{middle dot}00), and TH/TS on the log scale (OR 4{middle dot}80, p 0{middle dot}00). The McFadden pseudo R-squared for the logistic regression model is 0{middle dot}35, suggesting the model has a fair predictive power.

InterpretationWhile age and underlying diseases are known risk factors for poor prognosis, patients with a less damaged immune system at the time of hospitalization had higher chance of recovery. Close monitoring of the T lymphocyte subsets might provide valuable information of the patients condition change during the treatment process. Our web visualization application can be used as a supplementary tool for the evaluation.

3752,"Fast spread of COVID-19 in Europe and the US suggests the necessity of early, strong and comprehensive interventions","AbstratThe COVID-19 pandemic caused more than 800,000 infections and 40,000 deaths by the end of March 2020. However, some of the basic epidemiological parameters, such as the exponential epidemic growth rate and R0 are debated. We developed an inference approach to control for confounding factors in data collection, such as underreporting and changes in surveillance intensities, and fitted a mathematical model to infection and death count data collected from eight European countries and the US. In all countries, the early epidemic grew exponentially at rates between 0.19-0.29/day (epidemic doubling times between 2.4-3.7 days). This suggests a highly infectious virus with an R0 likely between 4.0 and 7.1. We show that similar levels of intervention efforts are needed, no matter the goal is mitigation or containment. Early, strong and comprehensive intervention efforts to achieve greater than 74-86% reduction in transmission are necessary.

3592,Using discrete Ricci curvatures to infer COVID-19 epidemic network fragility and systemic risk,"The damage of the novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is reaching unprecedented scales. There are numerous classical epidemiology models trying to quantify epidemiology metrics. Usually, to forecast epidemics, classical approaches need parameter estimations, such as the contagion rate or the basic reproduction number. Here, we propose a data-driven, parameter-free, geometric approach to access the emergence of a pandemic state by studying the Forman-Ricci and Ollivier-Ricci network curvatures. Discrete Ollivier-Ricci curvature has been used successfully to forecast risk in financial networks and we suggest that those results can provide analogous results for COVID-19 epidemic time-series. We first compute both curvatures in a toy-model of epidemic time-series with delays, which allows us to create epidemic networks. By doing so, we are able to verify that the Ollivier-Ricci and Forman-Ricci curvatures can be a parameter-free estimate for identifying a pandemic state in the simulated epidemic. On this basis, we then compute both Forman-Ricci and Ollivier-Ricci curvatures for real epidemic networks built from COVID-19 epidemic time-series available at the World Health Organization (WHO). Both curvatures allow us to detect early warning signs of the emergence of the pandemic. The advantage of our method lies in providing an early geometrical data marker for the pandemic state, regardless of parameter estimation and stochastic modelling. This work opens the possibility of using discrete geometry to study epidemic networks.","De Souza, D. B.; Da Cunha, J. T. S.; Figueiroa, E.; Correia, J. B.; Da Silva, H. P.; Filho, J. L. D.

5032,"Evidence-Based, Cost-Effective Interventions To Suppress The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review","BackgroundIn an unparalleled global response, during the COVID-19 pandemic, 90 countries asked 3.9 billion people to stay home. Yet some countries avoided lockdowns and focused on other strategies, like contact tracing and case isolation. How effective and cost-effective are these strategies? We aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the evidence on pandemic control, with a focus on cost-effectiveness.

MethodsFollowing PRISMA systematic review guidelines, MEDLINE (1946 to April week 2, 2020) and Embase (1974 to April 17, 2020) were searched using a range of terms related to pandemic control. Articles reporting on the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of at least one intervention were included and grouped into higher-quality evidence (randomized trials) and lower-quality evidence (other study designs).

ResultsWe found 1,653 papers; 62 were included. Higher-quality evidence was only available to support the effectiveness of hand washing and face masks. Modelling studies indicated that these measures are highly cost-effective. For other interventions, lower-quality evidence suggested that: (1) the most cost-effective interventions are swift contact tracing and case isolation, surveillance networks, protective equipment for healthcare workers, and early vaccination (when available); (2) home quarantines and stockpiling antivirals are less cost-effective; (3) social distancing measures like workplace and school closures are effective but costly, making them the least cost-effective options; (4) combinations are more cost-effective than single interventions; (5) interventions are more cost-effective when adopted early and for severe viruses like SARS-CoV-2. For H1N1 influenza, contact tracing was estimated to be 4,363 times more cost-effective than school closures ($2,260 vs. $9,860,000 per death prevented).

ConclusionsA cautious interpretation of the evidence suggests that for COVID-19: (1) social distancing is effective but costly, especially when adopted late and (2) adopting as early as possible a combination of interventions that includes hand washing, face masks, ample protective equipment for healthcare workers, and swift contact tracing and case isolation is likely to be the most cost-effective strategy.

10162,A link between inflammatory biomarkers and lung ultrasound observations in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Lung ultrasound (LUS) has shown to correlate well with the findings obtained by chest computed tomography (CT) in acute-phase COVID-19. Although there is a significant correlation between blood biomarkers and CT radiological findings, a potential correlation between biochemical parameters and LUS images is still unknown. Our purpose was to evaluate a potential association between lung lesions visualised by LUS and blood biomarkers as well as the ability to predict mortality from two different lung ultrasound scoring systems (LUSS). We performed a retrospective observational study on 45 patients aged >70 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection who required hospitalisation. LUS was carried out at admission and on day 7, when the clinical course was favourable or earlier in case of worsening. Disease severity was scored by means of LUSS in 8 (LUSS8) and in 12 (LUSS12) quadrants. LUS and blood draw for inflammatory marker analysis were performed at the same time. The correlation between biochemical parameters and either LUSS score was significant for ferritin levels. It was 0.486 (p=0.001) for LUSS8 and 0.458 (p=0.002) for LUSS12. Using a threshold score of 15 with LUSS12 predicted mortality in 86.7% of cases (ORcrude 31, CI 95% 4.79-200.51). Applying a threshold of 10 with LUSS8 predicted mortality in 88.9% (ORcrude 69.75, CI 95% 6.90-705.20). There is a correlation between ferritin levels and LUSS. The prognostic capacity of LUSS12 does not surpass that of LUSS8.

2430,"Revealing the influence of national public health policies for the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Wuhan, China through status dynamic modeling","BackgroundThe epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in Wuhan, China, and now is spreading worldwide. The Chinese government responded to this epidemic with multiple public health policies including locking down the city of Wuhan, establishing multiple temporary hospitals, and prohibiting public gathering events. Here, we constructed a new real-time status dynamic model of SEIO (MH) to reveal the influence of national public health policies and to model the epidemic in Wuhan.

MethodsA real-time status dynamic model was proposed to model the population of Wuhan in status Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected with symptoms (I), with Medical care (M), and Out of the system (O) daily. Model parameters were fitted according to the daily report of new infections from Jan. 27th, 2020 to Feb. 2nd, 2020. Using the fitted parameters, the epidemic under different conditions was simulated and compared with the current situation.

FindingAccording to our study, the first patient is most likely appeared on Nov. 29th, 2019. There had already been 4,153 infected people and 6,536 exposed ones with the basic reproduction number R0 of 2.65 before lockdown, whereas R0 dropped to 1.98 for the first 30 days after the lockdown. The peak point is Feb. 17th, 2020 with 24,115 infected people and the end point is Jun. 17th, 2020. In total, 77,453 people will be infected. If lockdown imposed 7 days earlier, the total number of infected people would be 21,508, while delaying the lockdown by 1-6 days would expand the infection scale 1.23 to 4.94 times. A delay for 7 days would make the epidemic finally out of control. Doubling the number of beds in hospitals would decrease the total infections by 28%, and further investment in bed numbers would yield a diminishing return. Last, public gathering events that increased the transmission parameter by 5% in one single day would increase 4,243 infected people eventually.

InterpretationOur model forecasted that the peak time in Wuhan was Feb. 17th, 2020 and the epidemic in Wuhan is now under control. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is currently a global public health threat for all nations. Multiple countries including South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, and the United States are suffering from SARS-CoV-2. Our study, which simulated the epidemic in Wuhan, the first city in the world fighting against SARS-CoV-2, may provide useful guidance for other countries in dealing with similar situations.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 has been currently believed to started from Wuhan, China. The Chinese government started to report the data including infected, cured and dead since Jan 20th, 2020. We searched PubMed and preprint archives for articles published up to Feb 28th, 2020, which contained information about the Wuhan outbreak using the terms of ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""2019-nCoV"", ""COVID-19"", ""public health policies"", ""coronavirus"", ""CoV"", ""Wuhan"", ""transmission model"", etc. And a number of articles were found to forecast the early dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19. Several of them mentioned the influence of city lockdown, whereas lacked research focused on revealing the impact of public health policies for the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 through modeling study.

Added value of this studyAs the first study systemically analysis the effect of three major public health policies including 1) lockdown of Wuhan City, 2) construction of temporary hospitals and 3) reduction of crowed gathering events in Wuhan city. The results demonstrated the epidemic in Wuhan from the potential first patient to the end point as well as the influence of public health policies are expected to provide useful guidance for other countries in fighting against the epidemic of SRAS-CoV-2.

Implications of all the available evidenceAvailable evidence illustrated the human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, in which the migration of people in China during the epidemic may quickly spread the epidemic to the rest of the nation. These findings also suggested that the lockdown of Wuhan city may slow down the spread of the epidemic in the rest of China.","Qiu, T.; Xiao, H.",2020-03-12,Health Policy,10.1101/2020.03.10.20032995,1,Tianyi Qiu,Fudan University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.20032995v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.20032995v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
2753,A brief review of antiviral drugs evaluated in registered clinical trials for COVID-19,"BackgroundAlthough a number of antiviral agents have been evaluated for coronaviruses there are no approved drugs available. To provide an overview of the landscape of therapeutic research for COVID-19, we conducted a review of registered clinical trials.

MethodsA review of currently registered clinical trials was performed on registries, including the Chinese (chictr.org.cn) and US (clinicaltrials.gov) databases to identify relevant studies up to March, 7th 2020. The search was conducted using the search terms ""2019-nCoV"", ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""Hcov-19"", ""new coronavirus"", ""novel coronavirus"". We included interventional clinical trials focusing on patients with COVID-19 and assessing antiviral drugs or agents.

FindingsOut of the 353 studies identified, 115 clinical trials were selected for data extraction. Phase IV trials were the most commonly reported study type (n=27, 23%). However, 62 trials (54%) did not describe the phase of the study. Eighty percent (n=92) of the trials were randomized with parallel assignment and the median number of planned inclusions was 63 (IQR, 36-120). Open-label studies were the most frequent (46%) followed by double-blind (13%) and single blind studies (10%). The most frequently assessed therapies were: stem cells therapy (n=23 trials), lopinavir/ritonavir (n=15), chloroquine (n=11), umifenovir (n=9), hydroxychloroquine (n=7), plasma treatment (n=7), favipiravir (n=7), methylprednisolone (n=5), and remdesivir (n=5). Remdesivir was tested in 5 trials with a median of 400 (IQR, 394-453) planned inclusions per trial, while stem cells therapy was tested in 23 trials, but had a median of 40 (IQR, 23-60) planned inclusions per trial. Lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with the highest total number of planned inclusions (2606) followed by remdesivir (2155). Only 52% of the clinical trials reported the treatment dose (n=60) and only 34% (n=39) the duration. The primary outcome was clinical in 76 studies (66%), virological in 27 (23%); radiological in 9 (8%) or immunological in three studies (3%).

InterpretationNumerous clinical trials have been registered since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, however, a number of information regarding drugs or trial design were lacking.

3808,Plasma Metabolomic and Lipidomic Alterations Associated with COVID-19,"The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global public health crisis. The symptoms of COVID-19 range from mild to severe conditions. However, the physiological changes associated with COVID-19 are barely understood. In this study, we performed targeted metabolomic and lipidomic analyses of plasma from a cohort of COVID-19 patients who had experienced different symptoms. We found the metabolite and lipid alterations exhibit apparent correlation with the course of disease in these COVID-19 patients, indicating that the development of COVID-19 affected whole-body metabolism of the patients. In particular, malic acid of the TCA cycle and carbamoyl phosphate of urea cycle reveal the altered energy metabolism and hepatic dysfunction, respectively. It should be noted that carbamoyl phosphate is profoundly down-regulated in fatal patients compared with mild patients. And more importantly, guanosine monophosphate (GMP), which is mediated by not only GMP synthase but also CD39 and CD73, is significant changed between healthy subjects and COVID-19 patients, as well as between the mild and fatal groups. In addition, the dyslipidaemia was observed in COVID-19 patients. Overall, the disturbed metabolic patterns have been found to align with the progress and severity of COVID-19. This work provides valuable knowledge about plasma biomarkers associated with COVID- 19 and potential therapeutic targets, as well as important resource for further studies of COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Wu, D.; Shu, T.; Yang, X.; Song, J.-X.; Zhang, M.; Yao, C.; Wen, L.; Huang, M.; Yu, Y.; Yang, Q.; Zhu, T.; Xu, J.; Mu, J.; Wang, Y.; Wang, H.; Tang, T.; Ren, Y.; Wu, Y.; Lin, S.-H.; Qiu, Y.; Zhang, D.-Y.; Shang, Y.; Zhou, X.",2020-04-26,Pathology,10.1101/2020.04.05.20053819,3,Yang Qiu,Wuhan Institute of Virology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20053819v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20053819v3.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1093/nsr/nwaa086
13021,"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rabies reemergence in Latin America: the case of Arequipa, Peru","Over the past decades, there has been tremendous progress towards eliminating canine rabies in Latin America. Major components of rabies prevention programs in Latin America leading to these successes have been constant and intense surveillance for rabid dogs and uninterrupted yearly mass dog vaccination campaigns. However, vital measures to control COVID-19 in Latin America have had the negative trade-off of jeopardizing these rabies elimination and prevention activities. In this paper, we aimed to assess the effect of interrupting canine rabies surveillance and mass dog vaccination campaigns on rabies trends. We built a deterministic compartment model of dog rabies dynamics parameterized for conditions found in Arequipa, Peru, where there is an ongoing dog rabies epidemic. Our model suggests that a decrease in canine vaccination coverage as well as decreased surveillance leading to an increased length of survival of infected dogs could lead to a sharp rise in canine rabies and, subsequently, human rabies risk. We examined our results over the best estimate of the basic reproductive number in Arequipa (R0 = 1.44) and a range of plausible values for R0 (1.36 - 2). The rising trend was consistent. It is very possible that COVID-19 will continue to challenge our public health departments in the short- and medium-term. Innovative strategies to conduct dog vaccination and rabies surveillance during these trying times should be considered to safeguard the achievements made in Latin America towards the elimination of dog-mediated human rabies.","Raynor, B.; Diaz, E.

20099,"Fever, Diarrhea, and Severe Disease Correlate with High Persistent Antibody Levels against SARS-CoV-2","Lasting immunity will be critical for overcoming the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, factors that drive the development of high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and how long those antibodies persist remain unclear. Our objective was to comprehensively evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a clinically diverse COVID-19 convalescent cohort at defined time points to determine if anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persist and to identify clinical and demographic factors that correlate with high titers. Using a novel multiplex assay to quantify IgG against four SARS-CoV-2 antigens, a receptor binding domain-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 inhibition assay, and a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay, we found that 98% of COVID-19 convalescent subjects had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies five weeks after symptom resolution (n=113). Further, antibody levels did not decline three months after symptom resolution (n=79). As expected, greater disease severity, older age, male sex, obesity, and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score correlated with increased anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. We demonstrated for the first time that COVID-19 symptoms, namely fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea and low appetite, correlated consistently with higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels.

Objective: We aimed to investigate the clinical manifestation include signs and symptoms, laboratory results, and perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19. Materials and Methods: We searched PubMed via LitCovid hub, Embase, Scopus, Web of sciences, and Google scholar on 07 April 2020. Meta-analysis was performed via CMA software using the Mantel-Haenszel method. The event rate with 95% CI was calculated for each variable. Results: Ten studies were selected. The pooled prevalence for fever, post-partum fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue, dyspnea, sore throat, and diarrhea were 66.8 %, 37.1 %, 35.5 %, 24.6 %, 14.9%, 14.6 %, 11.5%, and 7.6 %, respectively. Laboratory test results were 49.8 % for lymphopenia, 47.7 % for leukocytosis, 83.7 % for elevated neutrophil ratio, 57 % for elevated C-reactive protein, and 71.4 % for decreased lymphocyte ratio. The rate of cesarean section for delivery in all cases was 84%. Only one case was the newborn of a mother with COVID-19 positive. Also, there was only one death due to Decreased lymphocyte ratio. Conclusion: Fever was the most common signs and symptoms in pregnant women with COVID-19. Among the laboratory tests, the highest amount was related to elevated neutrophil ratio. It seems that due to the differences between pregnant women and the general population, special measures should be considered to treat these patients.","Hassanipour, S.; Bagheri Faradonbeh, S.; Momeni, K.; Heidarifard, Z.; Khosousi, M.-J.; Khosousi, L.; Ameri, H.; Arab-Zozani, M.",2020-09-28,Health Policy,10.1101/2020.09.28.20202945,1,Morteza Arab-Zozani,"Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.28.20202945v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.28.20202945v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.18502/ijrm.v18i12.8022
6077,TRACKING AND PREDICTING COVID-19 RADIOLOGICAL TRAJECTORY USING DEEP LEARNING ON CHEST X-RAYS: INITIAL ACCURACY TESTING,"BackgroundDecision scores and ethically mindful algorithms are being established to adjudicate mechanical ventilation in the context of potential resources shortage due to the current onslaught of COVID-19 cases. There is a need for a reproducible and objective method to provide quantitative information for those scores.

PurposeTowards this goal, we present a retrospective study testing the ability of a deep learning algorithm at extracting features from chest x-rays (CXR) to track and predict radiological evolution.

Materials and MethodsWe trained a repurposed deep learning algorithm on the CheXnet open dataset (224,316 chest X-ray images of 65,240 unique patients) to extract features that mapped to radiological labels. We collected CXRs of COVID-19-positive patients from two open-source datasets (last accessed on April 9, 2020)(Italian Society for Medical and Interventional Radiology and MILA). Data collected form 60 pairs of sequential CXRs from 40 COVID patients (mean age {+/-} standard deviation: 56 {+/-} 13 years; 23 men, 10 women, seven not reported) and were categorized in three categories: ""Worse"", ""Stable"", or ""Improved"" on the basis of radiological evolution ascertained from images and reports. Receiver operating characteristic analyses, Mann-Whitney tests were performed.

ResultsOn patients from the CheXnet dataset, the area under ROC curves ranged from 0.71 to 0.93 for seven imaging features and one diagnosis. Deep learning features between ""Worse"" and ""Improved"" outcome categories were significantly different for three radiological signs and one diagnostic (""Consolidation"", ""Lung Lesion"", ""Pleural effusion"" and ""Pneumonia""; all P < 0.05). Features from the first CXR of each pair could correctly predict the outcome category between ""Worse"" and ""Improved"" cases with 82.7% accuracy.

12693,A variational model for computing the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2,"We propose a variational model for computing the effective reproduction number (ERN) of SARS-CoV-2 from the daily count of incident cases. This computation only requires the knowledge of the serial interval. The ERN estimate is made through the minimization of a functional that includes: (i) the adjustment of the incidence curve using an epidemiological model, (ii) the regularity of the estimation of the ERN and, (iii) the adjustment of the initial value to an initial estimate of R0 obtained from the initial exponential growth of the epidemic. The model does not assume any statistical distribution for the ERN and, more importantly, does not require truncating the serial interval when its distribution contains negative days. A comparative study has been carried out with the standard EpiEstim method. For a particular choice of the parameters of the variational model and of the serial interval, a good agreement has been obtained between the estimate provided by the variational model and a 7 days shifted estimate obtained by EpiEstim. This backward shift suggests that our estimate is closer to present than that of EpiEstim. We also examine how to forecast the value of the ERN and the number of infected in the short term by two different extrapolation techniques.

7569,"Development and Validation of Two In-house, Low-Cost SARS-CoV-2 Detection Assays","BackgroundOne major challenge for detecting the virus that causes COVID-19 is commercial SARS-CoV-2 testing kit or reagent availability. To allow every laboratory or hospital access to an in-house assay, we developed two low-cost SARS-CoV-2 detection assay protocols using in-house primers and reagents/equipment on hand in most biology or diagnostic laboratories: a SYBR Green-based RT-PCR and PCR assays. RNA extraction has also become a major bottleneck due to limited supplies and the required labor. Thus, we validated alternative RNA extraction protocols.

MethodsSARS-CoV-2 genome sequences deposited into the GISAID database were retrieved to design and synthesize in-house primers. Forty patient samples were collected by nasopharyngeal swab, coded, and used to develop and validate the assay protocols. Both assays used TRIzol and heat-processing techniques to extract RNA from patient samples and to inactivate the virus; thus, testing was conducted in a conventional biosafety level 2 laboratory.

ResultsThe sensitivity and specificity of the primers were evaluated using samples previously confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positive amplicons were sequenced to confirm the results. The assay protocols were developed, and the specificity of each PCR product was confirmed using melting curve analyses. The most accurate heat-processing technique for primers with short amplicon lengths was 95 {degrees}C for 15 mins. Of 40 samples, both the SYBR Green-based quantitative RT-PCR assay and the PCR assay detected SARS-CoV-2 target genes in 28 samples, with no false-positive or false-negative results. These findings were 100% concordant with those of the diagnostic laboratory that tested the same samples using a Rotor-Gene PCR cycler with an Altona Diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 kit (R2=0.889).

ConclusionsThese approaches are reliable, repeatable, specific, sensitive, simple, and low-cost tools for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a conventional biosafety level 2 laboratory, offering alternative approaches when commercial kits are unavailable or cost ineffective.","Alhamlan, F.; Alqahtani, A.; Bakheet, D.; Bohol, M.; Althawadi, S.; Mutabagani, M.; Almaghrabi, R.; Obeid, D.",2020-05-21,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.18.20105510,1,Fatimah Alhamlan,King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.18.20105510v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.18.20105510v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA

ResultsOf the 35 SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative probable COVID-19 patients, all of them had tested at least 3 times of nucleic acid, 3 were believed to be non-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared with confirmed patients, antibody negative probable patients were younger (P=0.017), exhibited similar symptoms and chest CT images, had higher lymphocyte count (P=0.004) and albumin level (P<0.001), showed lower lactate dehydrogenase level (P=0.011) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P<0.001). During hospitalization, all the 35 patients had contacted with confirmed COVID-19 patients, but all used general face mask for protection and maintained a social distance of more than one meter from each other. All the isolation wards were kept ventilation and disinfected once a day. After discharged from hospital, all of them had negative nucleic acid tests and no one developed symptoms again.

ConclusionsThe conditions of patients with AbN probable COVID-19 were less critical than those of patients with confirmed COVID-19. Room ventilation and daily disinfection, wearing face masks, and maintaining social distance might be helpful to prevent patients from hospital acquired COVID-19 infection.","Duan, L.; Zhang, S.; Guo, M.; Zhou, E.; Fan, J.; Wang, X.; Wang, L.; Wu, F.; Jin, Y.",2020-06-22,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.18.20134619,1,Yang Jin,"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.18.20134619v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.18.20134619v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
15025,National Longitudinal Mediators of Psychological Distress During Stringent COVID-19 Lockdown,"We leverage powerful time-series data from a national longitudinal sample measured before the COVID-19 pandemic and during the world's eighth most stringent COVID-19 lockdown (New Zealand, March-April 2020, N = 940) and apply Bayesian multilevel mediation models to rigorously test five theories of pandemic distress. Findings: (1) during lockdown, rest diminished distress; without rest psychological distress would have been about 1.74 times greater; (2) an elevated sense of community reduced distress, a little, but elevated government satisfaction was inert. Thus, the psychological benefits of lockdown extended to political discontents; (3) most lockdown distress arose from dissatisfaction from personal relationships. Social captivity, more than isolation, proved challenging; (4-5) Health and business satisfaction were stable; were they challenged substantially more distress would have ensued. Thus, lockdown benefited psychological health by affording safety, yet only because income remained secure. These national longitudinal findings clarify the mental health effects of stringent infectious disease containment.","Bulbulia, J. A.; Piven, S. D.; Barlow, F. K.; Davis, D. E.; Greaves, L.

8062,Investigation on the interaction between nifedipine and ritonavir containing antivirus regimens: a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis,"Background and ObjectiveHypertension is a common comorbidity of patients with COVID-19, SARS or HIV infection. Those patients are often treated with commonly used antiviral and antihypertensive agents concomitantly, such as ritonavir-containing regimens and nifedipine. Since ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, when nifedipine is combined with ritonavir-containing antiviral drugs, there is a potential risk of drug-drug interaction. This study aimed to provide guidance on nifedipine treatment during and after co-administration with ritonavir-containing regimens using a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) analysis.

MethodsA PBPK/PD model was developed for nifedipine by the software of Simcyp(R), and the model was verified using published data. The effects of ritonavir on nifedipine exposures and systolic blood pressure were assessed for instant-release, sustained-release and controlled-release formulations. Moreover, various nifedipine regimens were investigated when co-administrated with and withdrawing ritonavir.

ResultsPBPK/PD models for three formulations of nifedipine were successfully established. The model predicted pharmacokinetic profiles of nifedipine were comparable to the published data. Ratios of predicted versus observed AUCDDI/AUCNifedipine of nifedipine were within 0.70- to 1.83-fold. Model simulations showed that the inhibitory effect of ritonavir on CYP3A4 increased the Cmax of nifedipine by 9.82-34.35 times and the AUC24h by 44.94-50.77 times at steady state. Moreover, nifedipine dose reduced to 1/16 of the regular dose during ritonavir co-administration could lead to severe hypotension.

ConclusionsRitonavir had a pronounced influence on the pharmacokinetics and antihypertensive effect of nifedipine. It is not recommended for patients to take nifedipine and ritonavir-containing regimens simultaneously.","Niu, W.-J.; Li, S.-Z.; Jin, S.-S.; Lin, X.-Y.; Zhang, M.-W.; Cai, W.-M.; Zhong, M.-K.; Xiang, X.-Q.; Jiao, Z.",2020-05-26,Pharmacology And Therapeutics,10.1101/2020.05.19.20106658,1,Zheng Jiao,"Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20106658v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20106658v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
17931,Epigenetic clocks are not accelerated in COVID-19 patients,"Age is a major risk factor for severe outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but it remains unclear if this is rather due to increased chronological age or biological age. During lifetime, specific DNA methylation changes are acquired in our genome that act as ""epigenetic clocks"" allowing to estimate donor age and to provide a surrogate marker for biological age. In this study, we followed the hypothesis that particularly patients with accelerated epigenetic age are affected by severe outcomes of COVID-19. Using four different age predictors, we did not observe accelerated age in global DNA methylation profiles of blood samples of nine COVID-19 patients. Alternatively, we used targeted bisulfite amplicon sequencing of three age-associated genomic regions to estimate donor-age of blood samples of 95 controls and seventeen COVID-19 patients. The predictions correlated well with chronological age, while COVID-19 patients even tended to be predicted younger than expected. Furthermore, lymphocytes in nineteen COVID-19 patients did not reveal significantly accelerated telomere attrition. Our results demonstrate that these biomarkers of biological age are therefore not suitable to predict a higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection in elderly patients.","Franzen, J.; Nuechtern, S.; Tharmapalan, V.; Vieri, M.; Nikolic, M.; Han, Y.; Balfanz, P.; Marx, N.; Dreher, M.; Bruemmendorf, T.

7174,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Luxembourgish population: the CON-VINCE study.,"BACKGROUNDThe World Health Organization declared the outbreak of coronavirus disease to be a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. The first SARS-CoV-2 infection was subsequently detected in Luxembourg on February 29, 2020. Representative population-based data, including asymptomatic individuals for assessing the viral spread and immune response was, however, lacking worldwide.

METHODSUsing a panel-based method, we recruited a representative sample of the Luxembourgish population based on age, gender and residency for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody status in order to define prevalence irrespective of clinical symptoms. Participants were contacted via email to fill an online questionnaire before biosampling at local laboratories. Participants provided information related to clinical symptoms, epidemiology, socioeconomic and psychological assessments and underwent biosampling, rRT-PCR testing and serology for SARS-CoV-2.

RESULTSA total of 1862 individuals were included for our representative sample of the general Luxembourgish population. We detected an ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection based on rRT-PCR in 5 participants. h Four of the SARS-CoV-2 infected participants were oligosymptomatic and one was asymptomatic. Overall, 35 participants (1.97%) had developed a positive IgG response, of whom 11 self-reported to have previously received a positive rRT-PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data indicate a prevalence of 0.3% for active SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Luxembourgish population between 18 and 79 years of age.

CONCLUSIONSLuxembourgish residents show a low rate of acute infections after 7 weeks of confinement and present with an antibody profile indicative of a more recent immune response to SARS-CoV-2. All infected individuals were oligo- or asymptomatic. Bi-weekly follow-up visits over the next 2 months will inform about the viral spread by oligo- and asymptomatic carriers and the individual changes in the immune profile.","Snoeck, C.

20357,"Intermediate-dose anticoagulation, aspirin, and in-hospital mortality in COVID-19: a propensity score-matched analysis","BackgroundThrombotic complications occur at high rates in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, yet the impact of intensive antithrombotic therapy on mortality is uncertain.

Research QuestionHow does in-hospital mortality compare with intermediate-versus prophylactic-dose anticoagulation, and separately with in-hospital aspirin versus no antiplatelet therapy, in treatment of COVID-19?

Study Design and MethodsUsing data from 2785 hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients, we established two separate, nested cohorts of patients (1) who received intermediate- or prophylactic-dose anticoagulation (""anticoagulation cohort"", N = 1624), or (2) who were not on home antiplatelet therapy and received either in-hospital aspirin or no antiplatelet therapy (""aspirin cohort"", N = 1956). Propensity score matching utilizing various markers of illness severity and other patient-specific covariates yielded treatment groups with well-balanced covariates in each cohort. The primary outcome was cumulative incidence of in-hospital death.

ResultsAmong propensity score-matched patients in the anticoagulation cohort (N = 382), in a multivariable regression model, intermediate-compared to prophylactic-dose anticoagulation was associated with a significantly lower cumulative incidence of in-hospital death (hazard ratio 0.518 [0.308-0.872]). Among propensity-score matched patients in the aspirin cohort (N = 638), in a multivariable regression model, in-hospital aspirin compared to no antiplatelet therapy was associated with a significantly lower cumulative incidence of in-hospital death (hazard ratio 0.522 [0.336-0.812]).

InterpretationIn this propensity score-matched, observational study of COVID-19, intermediate-dose anticoagulation and aspirin were each associated with a lower cumulative incidence of in-hospital death.

2519,Systematic review and meta-analysis of predictive symptoms and comorbidities for severe COVID-19 infection,"Background/introductionCOVID-19, a novel coronavirus outbreak starting in China, is now a rapidly developing public health emergency of international concern. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. It has been noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease. However, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of COVID-19 severity.

MethodThis study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. A literature search was performed in three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health) for studies indexed up to 5thMarch 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and both also completed data extraction. Quality appraisal of studies was performed using the STROBE checklist. Random effects meta-analysis was performed for selected symptoms and comorbidities to identify those most associated with severe COVID-19 infection or ICU admission.

ResultsOf the 2259 studies identified, 42 were selected after title and abstract analysis, and 7 studies (including 1813 COVID-19 patients) were chosen for inclusion. The ICU group were older (62.4 years) compared to the non-ICU group (46 years), with a significantly higher proportion of males (67.2% vs. 57.1%, p=0.04). Dyspnoea was the only significant symptom predictive for both severe disease (pOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.83 - 7.46) and ICU admission (pOR 6.55, 95% CI 4.28- 10.0). Notwithstanding the low prevalence of COPD in severe disease and ICU-admitted groups (4.5% and 9.7%, respectively), COPD was the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease (pOR 6.42, 95% CI 2.44 - 16.9) and ICU admission (pOR 17.8, 95% CI 6.56 - 48.2). Cardiovascular disease and hypertension were also strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission. Those with CVD and hypertension were 4.4 (95% CI 2.64 - 7.47) and 3.7 (95% CI 2.22 - 5.99) times more likely to have an ICU admission respectively, compared to patients without the comorbidity.

ConclusionsDyspnoea was the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission, and could be useful in guiding clinical management decisions early in the course of illness. When looking at ICU-admitted patients, who represent the more severe end of the spectrum of clinical severity, COPD patients are particularly vulnerable, and those with cardiovascular disease and hypertension are also at a high-risk of severe illness. To aid clinical assessment, risk stratification, efficient resource allocation, and targeted public health interventions, future research must aim to further define those at high-risk of severe illness with COVID-19.","Jain, V.; Yuan, J.-M.",2020-03-16,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.03.15.20035360,1,Vageesh Jain,"Institute for Global Health, University College London (UCL), UK; Public Health, London Borough of Hackney, London, UK",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20035360v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20035360v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1007/s00038-020-01390-7
5232,Pooling of Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimens for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR,"Systematic testing of large population groups by RT-PCR is mandatory to Covid-19 case identification and contact tracing in order to minimize the likelyhood of resurgence in contagion. Sample pooling for RT-PCR has been effectively used to detect community transmission of SARS CoV-2. Nevertheless, this procedure may decrease the sensitivity of RT-PCR assays due to specimen dilution. We evaluated the efficacy of this strategy for diagnosis of Covid-19 using a sensitive commercially-available RT-PCR targeting SARS CoV-2 E and RdRp genes in a single reaction. A total of 20 mini-pools containing either 5 (n=10) or 10 (n=10) nasopharyngeal exudates collected in universal transport medium were made, each of which including a unique positive NP specimen. Positive specimens yielding CT <32 for the E gene (6 out of 10) or <35.2 for the RdRP gene (7 out of 10) were detected in mini-pools of both sizes. In contrast, most NP samples displaying CTs > 35.8 for the E gene or 35.7 for the RdRP gene remained undetected in mini-pools of 5 specimens (3/4 and 2/3, respectively) or in mini-pools of 10 samples (4/4 and 3/3, respectively.","Torres, I.; Albert, E.; Navarro, D.",2020-04-25,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.22.20075598,1,David Navarro,"Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20075598v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20075598v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1002/jmv.25971
10876,COVID 19 associated anxiety enhances tinnitus,"BackgroundWe investigated how the anxiety associated with COVID-19 impacts the severity of tinnitus and the outcomes of tinnitus therapy

Methods and FindingsA retrospective research design was used to compare the clinical characteristics of tinnitus between patients from March to April 2020 under pandemic pressure and those from the matching period in 2019. Tinnitus severity was evaluated using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) questionnaire and the minimum masking level (MML) measure while anxiety was quantified using the Zungs Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). The assessments were repeated after a 2-month interval, in which sound therapy was applied to a subgroup of patients. In all, 94 and 70 cases were reported in the 2020 and 2019 groups, respectively. The effects of the pandemic on emotional status were evident from a higher incidence of anxiety and much higher SAS scores in the 2020 group. There was also an increase in the THI scores in the 2020 group, but the between-year difference was smaller than that of the SAS score. Moreover, there was no between-year difference in MML or the treatment effect, as measured via both THI and MML. Furthermore, the reduction in SAS score in the second assessment was significantly smaller in the 2020 group. However, a positive correlation between the initial SAS score and the improvement was seen within the 2020 group.

ConclusionsAnxiety increased greatly in tinnitus subjects due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However this was not associated with an increase in tinnitus severity in 2020. Instead, there was no between-year difference in the THI score or MML or in the improvement of either measure after treatment. The smaller improvement in SAS score and the positive correlation with the initial SAS score in the 2020 group suggests that the SAS score change in this group might largely be due to the natural relief of pressure as the pandemic decelerated in China. Therefore, the anxiety change induced by the COVID-19 pandemic is not likely to have a strong impact on tinnitus.","Xia, L.; Wang, J.; Chuan, D.; Fan, J.; Chen, Z.",2020-08-05,Otolaryngology,10.1101/2020.07.02.20145532,2,Dong Chuan,"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Sichuan Provincial People Hospital and Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610072, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20145532v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20145532v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
11890,A New Mathematical Approach for the Estimation of epidemic Model Parameters with Demonstration on COVID-19 Pandemic in Libya,"BackgroundThe SEIR model or a variation of it is commonly used to study epidemic spread and make predictions on how it evolves. It is used to guide officials in their response to an epidemic. This research demonstrates an effective and simple approach that estimates the parameters of any variations of the SEIR model. This new technique will be demonstrated on the spread of COVID-19 in Libya.

MethodsA five compartmental epidemic model is used to model the COVID-19 pandemic in Libya. Two sets of data are needed to evaluate the model parameters, the cumulative number of symptomatic cases and the total number of active cases. This data along with the assumption that the cumulative number of symptomatic cases grows exponentially, to determine most of the model parameters.

ResultsLibyas epidemic start-date was estimated as to = -18 {middle dot} 5 days, corresponding to May 5th. We mathematically demonstrated that the number of active cases follows two competing exponential distributions: a positive exponential function, measuring how many new cases are added, and a negative exponential function, measuring how many cases recovered. From this distribution we showed that the average recovery time is 48 days, and the incubation period is 15.2 days. Finally, the productive number was estimated as R0 = 7{middle dot}6.

ConclusionsWith only the cumulative number of cases and the total number of active cases of COVID19, several important SEIR model parameters can be measured effectively. This approach can be applied for any infectious disease epidemic anywhere in the world.","Saleh, M. E.; Saleh, Z.

17864,Predictors of adverse outcome in patients with suspected COVID-19 managed in a virtual hospital setting: a cohort study,"ObjectiveIdentify predictors of adverse outcome in a Virtual Hospital (VH) setting for COVID 19.

DesignReal-world prospective observational study.

SettingVirtual hospital remote assessment service in West Hertfordshire NHS Trust, UK.

ParticipantsPatients with suspected COVID-19 illness enrolled directly from the community (post-accident and emergency (A&E) or medical intake assessment) or post-inpatient admission.

Main outcome measureDeath or (re-)admission to inpatient hospital care over 28 days.

Results900 patients with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 (455 referred from A&E or medical intake and 445 post-inpatient) were included in the analysis. 76 (8.4%) of these experienced an adverse outcome (15 deaths in admitted patients, 3 deaths in patients not admitted, and 58 additional inpatient admissions). Predictors of adverse outcome were increase in age (OR 1.04 [95%CI: 1.02, 1.06] per year of age), history of cancer (OR 2.87 [95%CI: 1.41, 5.82]), history of mental health problems (OR 1.76 [95%CI: 1.02, 3.04]), severely impaired renal function (OR for eGFR <30 = 9.09 [95%CI: 2.01, 41.09]) and having a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result (OR 2.0 [95% CI: 1.11, 3.60]).

ConclusionsThese predictors may help direct intensity of monitoring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who are being remotely monitored by primary or secondary care services. Further research is needed to identify the reasons for increased risk of adverse outcome associated with cancer and mental health problems.

17193,Features of creatine-kinase in COVID-19 patients within various specific periods: A cohort study,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared as a threat to the global. Due to the lack of efficient treatments, indicators were urgently needed during the evolvement of disease to analyze the illness and prognosis, and prevent the aggravation of COVID-19.

MethodsPatients general information, clinical type, all CK values and outcome were collected. CK value of all cases during disease course started from different initial time were analyzed.

ResultsAll cases underwent 504 tests of CK since symptom onset and the median value was 51.7 (35.0-91.5) U/L. The first median value on the day 8 from exposure onset was 78.1 (69.1-85.8) U/L then showed an upward trend from the day 8 to the day 12 (reaching a peak of 279.3 U/L), finally showed a fluctuation decline after the day 12. The CK median value in critical cases reached the peak (625.5 U/L) on the transforming date, and then decreased rapidly to the normal range. Before death, the CK median value in dead cases firstly increased until the day -14 with a peak as 470.0 U/L, then decreased with fluctuation until day -2, and finally increased again on the day 0.

ConclusionsCK reached its peak on the day when it became critical type, dynamic detection of CK can guide clinical judgment of prognosis. The increase of CK is a high risk factor of death. Severe cell damage 2 weeks before death might determines the outcome of the disease even if CK drops to the normal range afterward.","Wan, S.; Qu, G.; Yu, H.; Zhu, H.; Huang, G.; Chen, L.; Zhang, M.; Liu, J.; Pei, B.",2020-11-01,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.28.20221119,1,Bin Pei,"Center of Evidence-based Medicine, Xiangyang No.1 People\'s Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine, Xiangyang 441000, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.28.20221119v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.28.20221119v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
15643,High-Quality Masks Reduce Infections and Deaths in the US,"ObjectivesTo evaluate the effectiveness of widespread adoption of masks or face coverings to reduce community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.

MethodsWe created an agent-based stochastic network simulation using a variant of the standard SEIR dynamic infectious disease model. We considered a mask order that was initiated 3.5 months after the first confirmed COVID-19 case. We varied the likelihood of individuals wearing masks from 0-100% in steps of 20% (mask adherence) and considered 25% to 90% mask-related reduction in viral transmission (mask efficacy). Sensitivity analyses assessed early (by week 13) versus late (by week 42) adoption of masks and geographic differences in adherence (highest in urban and lowest in rural areas).

ResultsIntroduction of mask use with 50% efficacy worn by 50% of individuals reduces the cumulative infection attack rate (IAR) by 27%, the peak prevalence by 49%, and population-wide mortality by 29%. If 90% of individuals wear 50% efficacious masks, this decreases IAR by 54%, peak prevalence by 75%, and population-wide mortality by 55%; similar improvements hold if 70% of individuals wear 75% efficacious masks. Late adoption reduces IAR and deaths by 18% or more compared to no adoption. Lower adoption in rural areas than urban would lead to rural areas having the highest IAR.

ConclusionsEven after community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been established, adoption of mask-wearing by a majority of community-dwelling individuals can meaningfully reduce the number and outcome of COVID-19 infections over and above physical distancing interventions.

HighlightsO_LIThis paper shows the impact of widespread adoption of masks in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with varying levels of population adherence, mask efficacy, and timing of mask adoption.
C_LIO_LIThe papers findings help inform messaging to policymakers at the state or local level considering adding or keeping mask mandates, and to communities to promote widespread adoption of high-quality masks.
C_LIO_LIAdoption of masks by at least half of the population can reduce cumulative infections and population deaths by more than 25%, while decreasing peak prevalence by about 50%. Even greater marginal improvements arise with adoption rates above 70%. The benefits of adopting high-quality masks is above that achieved by mobility changes and distancing alone.
C_LIO_LIRural and suburban areas are at higher relative risk than urban areas, due to less distancing and lower adoption of masks.

3769,Investigating the likely association between genetic ancestry and COVID-19 manifestations,"BackgroundThe novel coronavirus: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly throughout the world leading to catastrophic consequences. However, SARS-CoV-2 infection has shown discernible variability across the globe. While in some countries people are recovering relatively quickly, in others, recovery times have been comparatively longer and number of individuals succumbing to it are high. This variability in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) susceptibility is suggestive of a likely association between the genetic-make up of affected individuals modulated by their ancestry and the severity of COVID-19 manifestations.

ObjectiveIn this study, we aimed to evaluate the potential association between an individuals genetic ancestry and the extent of COVID-19 disease presentation employing Europeans as the case study. In addition, using a genome wide association (GWAS) approach we sought to discern the putative single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and genes that may be likely associated with differential COVID-19 manifestations by comparative analyses of the European and East Asian genomes.

MethodTo this end, we employed 10,215 ancient and modern genomes across the globe assessing 597,573 SNPs obtained from the databank of Dr. David Reich, Harvard Medical School, USA to evaluate the likely correlation between European ancestry and COVID-19 manifestations. Ancestry proportions were determined using qpAdm program implemented in AdmixTools v5.1. Pearsons correlation coefficient (r) between various ancestry proportions of European genomes and COVID-19 death/recovery ratio was calculated and its significance was statistically evaluated. Genome wide association study (GWAS) was performed in PLINK v1.9 to investigate SNPs with significant allele frequency variations among European and East Asian genomes that likely correlated with differential COVID-19 infectivity.

ResultsWe found significant positive correlation (r=0.58, P=0.03) between West European hunter gatherers (WHG) ancestral fractions and COVID-19 death/recovery ratio for data as of 5th April 2020. This association discernibly amplified (r=0.77, P=0.009) upon reanalyses based on data as of 30th June 2020, removing countries with small sample sizes and adding those that are a bridge between Europe and Asia. Using GWAS we further identified 404 immune response related SNPs by comparing publicly available 753 genomes from various European countries against 838 genomes from various Eastern Asian countries. Prominently, we identified that SNPs associated with immune-system related pathways such as interferon stimulated antiviral response, adaptive and innate immune system and IL-6 dependent immune responses show significant differences in allele frequencies [Chi square values ([&ge;]1500; P{approx}0)] between Europeans and East Asians.

ConclusionSo far, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the likely association between host genetic ancestry and COVID-19 severity. These findings improve our overall understanding of the putative genetic modifiers of COVID-19 clinical presentation. We note that the development of effective therapeutics will benefit immensely from more detailed analyses of individual genomic sequence data from COVID-19 patients of varied ancestries.","Das, R.; Ghate, S.

16316,"Using an Agent-Based Model to Assess K-12 School Re-openings Under Different COVID-19 Spread Scenarios - United States, School Year 2020/21","School-age children play a key role in the spread of airborne viruses like influenza due to the prolonged and close contacts they have in school settings. As a result, school closures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions were recommended as the first line of defense in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Assessing school reopening scenarios is a priority for states, administrators, parents, and children in order to balance educational disparities and negative population impacts of COVID-19. To address this challenge, we used an agent-based model that simulates communities across the United States including daycares, primary, and secondary schools to quantify the relative health outcomes of reopening schools. We explored different reopening scenarios including remote learning, in-person school, and several hybrid options that stratify the student population into cohorts (also referred to as split cohort) in order to reduce exposure and disease spread. In addition, we assessed the combined impact of reduced in-person attendance in workplaces (e.g., through differing degrees of reliance on telework and/or temporary workplace closings) and school reopening scenarios to quantify the potential impact of additional transmission pathways contributing to COVID-19 spread. Scenarios where split cohorts of students return to school in non-overlapping formats resulted in significant decreases in the clinical attack rate (i.e., the percentage of symptomatic individuals), potentially by as much as 75%. These split cohort scenarios have impacts which are only modestly lesser than the most impactful 100% distance learning scenario. Split cohort scenarios can also significantly avert the number of cases-approximately 60M and 28M-depending on the scenario, at the national scale over the simulated eight-month period. We found the results of our simulations to be highly dependent on the number of workplaces assumed to be open for in-person business, as well as the initial level of COVID-19 incidence within the simulated community. Our results show that reducing the number of students attending school leads to better health outcomes, and the split cohort option enables part-time in-classroom education while substantially reducing risk. The results of this study can support decisions regarding optimal school reopening strategies that at the population level balance education and the negative health outcomes of COVID-19.

7925,Association of Renin Angiotensin System Blockers with Outcomes in Patients with Covid-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"BackgroundPatients with cardiovascular disease are at increased risk of critical illness and mortality from Covid-19 disease. Conflicting findings have raised concerns regarding the association of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) use with likelihood or severity of infection during this pandemic.

ObjectiveTo study the cumulative evidence for association of ACEI/ARB use with outcomes among patients with confirmed Covid-19.

MethodsThe MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were thoroughly searched from November 01, 2019 to May 15, 2020 for studies reporting on outcomes based on ACEI/ARB use in patients with confirmed Covid-19. Preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis guidelines were used for the present study. Relevant data was collected and pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random-effects model.

Main Outcome measuresIn-hospital mortality was the primary end of interest. Second end-point was severe or critical illness defined as either need for intensive care unit, invasive mechanical ventilation, or mortality.

ResultsFifteen studies with total of 23,822 patients (N ACEI/ARB=6,650) were included in the present analysis. Overall, prevalence of ACEI/ARB use ranged from 7.7% to 46.2% across studies. Among 10 studies, patients using ACEI/ARB had similar odds of mortality [OR 1.03 (0.69-1.55)] and severe or critical illness [1.18 (0.91-1.54)] compared to those not on ACEI/ARB. In an analysis restricted to patients with hypertension, ACEI/ARB use was associated with significantly lower mortality [0.64 (0.45-0.89)], while the odds of severe/critical illness [0.76(0.52-1.12); p=0.16] remained non-significant compared with non-ACEI/ARB users.

ConclusionThere is no evidence for increased risk of severe illness or mortality in patients using ACEI/ARB compared with non-users. In patients with hypertension, ACE/ARB use might be associated with reduced mortality, however these findings need to be confirmed in prospective randomized controlled trials.","Garg, A.; Rout, A.; Sharma, A.; Fiorello, B.; Kostis, J.

6537,Screening for SARS-CoV-2 infections with colorimetric RT-LAMP and LAMP sequencing,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus poses a significant public-health problem. In order to control the pandemic, rapid tests for detecting existing infections and assessing virus spread are critical.

Approaches to detect viral RNA based on reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) hold outstanding promise towards greatly simplified and broadly applicable testing methods. RT-LAMP assays appear more robust than qPCR-based methods and only require incubation at a constant temperature, thus eliminating the need for sophisticated instrumentation.

Here, we tested a two-color RT-LAMP protocol using clinical SARS-CoV-2 samples and also established a protocol that does not require prior RNA isolation (""swab-to-RT-LAMP""). Our study is based on several hundred clinical patient samples with a wide range of viral loads, thus allowing, for the first time, to accurately determine the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients. We found that RT-LAMP can reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 samples with a qPCR threshold cycle number (CT value) of up to 30 in the standard RT-qPCR assay. We used both, either purified RNA or direct pharyngeal swab specimens and showed that RT-LAMP assays have, despite a decreased sensitivity compared to RT-qPCR, excellent specificity. We also developed a multiplexed LAMP-sequencing protocol as a diagnostic and validation procedure to detect and record the outcome of RT-LAMP assays. LAMP-sequencing is fully scalable and can assess the results of thousands of LAMP reactions in parallel. Finally, we propose applications of RT-LAMP based assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection.","Dao Thi, V. L.; Herbst, K.; Boerner, K.; Meurer, M.; Kremer, L. P.

9803,A compound Dirichlet-Multinomial model for provincial level Covid-19 predictions in South Africa,"Accurate prediction of COVID-19 related indicators such as confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries play an important in understanding the spread and impact of the virus, as well as resource planning and allocation. In this study, we approach the prediction problem from a statistical perspective and predict confirmed cases and deaths on a provincial level. We propose the compound Dirichlet Multinomial distribution to estimate the proportion parameter of each province as mutually exclusive outcomes. Furthermore, we make an assumption of exponential growth of the total cummulative counts in order to predict future total counts. The outcomes of this approach is not only prediction. The variation of the proportion parameter is characterised by the Dirichlet distribution, which provides insight in the movement of the pandemic across provinces over time.","De Waal, A.; De Waal, D.",2020-06-17,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.15.20131433,1,Alta De Waal,University of Pretoria,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.20131433v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.20131433v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
17618,The role of children in the transmission chain of SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review and update of current evidence,"Decisions on school closures and on safe schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic should be evidence-based. We conducted a systematic literature review to assess child-to-child and child-to-adult SARS-CoV-2 transmission and to characterise the potential role of school closures on community transmission. 1337 peer-reviewed articles published through August 31, 2020 were screened; 22 were included in this review. The literature appraised provides sufficient evidence that children can both be infected by and transmit SARS-CoV-2 in community, household and school settings. Transmission by children was most frequently documented in household settings, while examples of children as index cases in school settings were rare. Included studies suggested that school closures may help to reduce SARS- CoV-2 transmission, but the societal, economic, and educational impacts of prolonged school closures must be considered. In-school mitigation measures, alongside continuous surveillance and assessment of emerging evidence, will promote the protection and educational attainment of students and support the educational workforce.","Suk, J.

16200,One size fits all?: Modeling face-mask fit on population-based faces,"The use of face masks by the general population during viral outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, although at times controversial, has been effective in slowing down the spread of the virus. The fit of simple cloth masks on the face as well as the resulting perimeter leakage and face mask efficacy are expected to be highly dependent on the type of mask and facial topology. However, this effect has to date, not been examined and quantified. Here, we study the leakage of a rectangular cloth mask on a large virtual population of subjects with diverse facial features, using computational mechanics modeling. The effect of weight, age, gender, and height on the leakage is studied. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended mask size was used as a basis for comparison and was found not to be the most effective design for all subjects. Thin, feminine, and young faces benefit from mask sizes smaller than that recommended by the CDC. The results show that side-edge tuck-in of the masks could lead to a larger localized gap opening in many face categories, and is therefore not recommended for all. The perimeter leakage from the face mask worn by thin/feminine faces is mostly from the leakage area along the bottom edge of the mask and therefore, a tuck-in of the bottom edge of the mask or a mask smaller than the CDC recommended mask size are proposed as a more effective design. The leakage from the top edge of the mask is determined to be largely unaffected by mask size and tuck-in ratio, meaning that other mechanical alterations such as a nose wire strip are necessary to reduce the leakage at this site.","Solano, T.; Mittal, R.; Shoele, K.",2020-10-12,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.10.07.20208744,1,Kourosh Shoele,Florida State University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208744v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208744v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

However, COVID-19 is spreading in different rates at different countries. Here, we tested the effect of three classes of predictors, i.e., socioeconomic, climatic and transport, on the rate of daily increase of COVID-19. We found that global connections, represented by countries importance in the global air transportation network, is the main explanation for the growth rate of COVID-19 in different countries. Climate, geographic distance and socioeconomics had a milder effect in this big picture analysis. Geographic distance and climate were significant barriers in the past but were surpassed by the human engine that allowed us to colonize most of our planet land surface.

7430,Assessment of dispersion of airborne particles of oral/nasal fluid by high flow nasal cannula therapy,"BackgroundNasal High Flow (NHF) therapy delivers flows of heated humidified gases up to 60 LPM (litres per minute) via a nasal cannula. Particles of oral/nasal fluid released by patients undergoing NHF therapy may pose a cross-infection risk, which is a potential concern for treating COVID-19 patients.

MethodsLiquid particles within the exhaled breath of healthy participants were measured with two protocols: (1) high speed camera imaging and counting exhaled particles under high magnification (6 participants) and (2) measuring the deposition of a chemical marker (riboflavin-5-monophosphate) at a distance of 100 and 500 mm on filter papers through which air was drawn (10 participants). The filter papers were assayed with HPLC. Breathing conditions tested included quiet (resting) breathing and vigorous breathing (which here means nasal snorting, voluntary coughing and voluntary sneezing). Unsupported (natural) breathing and NHF at 30 and 60 LPM were compared.

ResultsO_LIImaging: During quiet breathing, no particles were recorded with unsupported breathing or 30 LPM NHF (detection limit for single particles 33 m). Particles were detected in 2 of 6 participants at 60 LPM quiet breathing at approximately 10% of the rate caused by unsupported vigorous breathing. Unsupported vigorous breathing released the greatest numbers of particles. Vigorous breathing with NHF at 60 LPM, released half the number of particles compared to vigorous breathing without NHF.
C_LIO_LIChemical marker tests: No oral/nasal fluid was detected in quiet breathing without NHF (detection limit 0.28 L/m3). In quiet breathing with NHF at 60 LPM, small quantities were detected in 4 out of 29 quiet breathing tests, not exceeding 17 L/m3. Vigorous breathing released 200-1000 times more fluid than the quiet breathing with NHF. The quantities detected in vigorous breathing were similar whether using NHF or not.
C_LI

ConclusionDuring quiet breathing, 60 LPM NHF therapy may cause oral/nasal fluid to be released as particles, at levels of tens of L per cubic metre of air.

Vigorous breathing (snort, cough or sneeze) releases 200 to 1000 times more oral/nasal fluid than quiet breathing. During vigorous breathing, 60 LPM NHF therapy caused no statistically significant difference in the quantity of oral/nasal fluid released compares to unsupported breathing.

NHF use does not increase the risk of dispersing infectious aerosols above the risk of unsupported vigorous breathing. Standard infection prevention and control measures should apply when dealing with a patient who has an acute respiratory infection, independent of which, if any, respiratory support is being used.","Jermy, M.

5352,Estimation of SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality rate by real-time antibody screening of blood donors,"BackgroundThe pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has tremendous consequences for our societies. Knowledge of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is needed to accurately monitor the spread of the epidemic and also to calculate the infection fatality rate (IFR). These measures may help the authorities to make informed decisions and adjust the current societal interventions. Blood donors comprise approximately 4.7% of the similarly aged population of Denmark and blood is donated in all areas of the country. The objective of this study was to perform real-time seroprevalence surveying among blood donors as a tool to estimate previous SARS-CoV-2 infections and the population based IFR.

MethodsAll Danish blood donors aged 17-69 years giving blood April 6 to 17 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and G antibodies using a commercial lateral flow test. Antibody status was compared between areas and an estimate of the IFR was calculated. The seroprevalence was adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity taking the uncertainties of the test validation into account when reporting the 95% confidence intervals (CI).

ResultsThe first 9,496 blood donors were tested and a combined adjusted seroprevalence of 1.7% (CI: 0.9-2.3) was calculated. The seroprevalence differed across areas. Using available data on fatalities and population numbers a combined IFR in patients younger than 70 is estimated at 82 per 100,000 (CI: 59-154) infections.

ConclusionsThe IFR was estimated to be slightly lower than previously reported from other countries not using seroprevalence data. The IFR, including only individuals with no comorbidity, is likely several fold lower than the current estimate. This may have implications for risk mitigation. We have initiated real-time nationwide anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveying of blood donations as a tool in monitoring the epidemic.","Erikstrup, C.; Hother, C. E.; Pedersen, O. B.

9455,"Private Health Sector in India: Ready and willing, yet underutilized in the Covid-19 pandemic.","BackgroundThe private medical sector is a resource that must be estimated for efficient inclusion into public healthcare during pandemics.

MethodsA survey was conducted among private healthcare workers to ascertain their views on the potential resources that can be accessed from the private sector and methods to do the same.

ResultsThere were 213 respondents, 80% of them being doctors. Nearly half (47.4%) felt that the contribution from the private medical sector has been suboptimal. Areas suggested for improved contributions by the private sector related to patient care (71.8%) and provision of equipment (62.4%), with fewer expectations (39.9%) on the research front. Another area of deemed support was maintaining continuity of care for non-COVID patients using virtual consultation services (77.4%), tele-consultation being the preferred option (60%). 58.2% felt that the Government had not involved the private sector adequately; and 45.1% felt they should be part of policy-making.

ConclusionA streamlined pathway to facilitate the private sector to join hands with the public sector for a national cause is the need of the hour. Through our study, we have identified gaps in the current contribution by the private sector and identified areas in which they could contribute, by their own admission.","Davalbhakta, S.; Sharma, S.; Gupta, S.; Agarwal, V.; Pandey, G.; Misra, D.

2293,A retrospective analysis of the dynamic transmission routes of the COVID-19 in mainland China,"The fourth outbreak of the Coronaviruses, known as the COVID-19, has occurred in Wuhan city of Hubei province in China in December 2019. We propose a time-varying sparse vector autoregressive (VAR) model to retrospectively analyze and visualize the dynamic transmission routes of this outbreak in mainland China over January 31 - February 19, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the influential inter-location routes from Hubei have become unidentifiable since February 4, 2020, whereas the self-transmission in each provincial-level administrative region (location, hereafter) was accelerating over February 4-15, 2020. From February 16, 2020, all routes became less detectable, and no influential transmissions could be identified on February 18 and 19, 2020. Such evidence supports the effectiveness of government interventions, including the travel restrictions in Hubei. Implications of our results suggest that in addition to the origin of the outbreak, virus preventions are of crucial importance in locations with the largest migrant workers percentages (e.g., Jiangxi, Henan and Anhui) to controlling the spread of COVID-19.","Jiang, X.; Chang, L.; Shi, Y.",2020-08-14,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.01.20029645,2,Yanlin Shi,Macquarie University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029645v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029645v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

DesignMulticenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial.

Setting16 government-designated COVID-19 treatment centers in China through 11 to 29 in February 2020.

Participants150 patients hospitalized with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were included in the intention to treat analysis. 75 patients were assigned to HCQ plus SOC and 75 to SOC alone.

InterventionsHCQ was administrated with a loading dose of 1, 200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintained dose of 800 mg daily for the remaining days (total treatment duration: 2 or 3 weeks for mild/moderate or severe patients, respectively).

Main outcome measuresThe primary outcome was whether participants had a negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 by 28 days, and was analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Adverse events were analyzed in the safety population in which HCQ recipients were participants who actually received at least one dose of HCQ and HCQ non-recipients were those actually managed with SOC alone.

ResultsAmong 150 patients, 148 were with mild to moderate disease and 2 were with severe disease. The mean days ({+/-} standard deviation, min to max) from symptoms onset to randomization was 16.6 ({+/-}10.5 days, 3 to 41 days). The negative conversion probability by 28 days in SOC plus HCQ group was 85.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 73.8% to 93.8%), similar to that in the SOC group 81.3% (95%CI 71.2% to 89.6%). Between-group difference was 4.1% (95%CI -10.3% to 18.5%). In the safety population, adverse events were recorded in 7 (8.8%) HCQ non-recipients (N=80) and in 21 (30%) HCQ recipients (N=70). The most common adverse event in the HCQ recipients was diarrhea, reported in 7 (10%) patients. Two HCQ recipients reported serious adverse events.

ConclusionsThe administration of HCQ did not result in a significantly higher negative conversion probability than SOC alone in patients mainly hospitalized with persistent mild to moderate COVID-19. Adverse events were higher in HCQ recipients than in HCQ non-recipients.

What is already known on this topic-- The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) imposes substantial burdens on individuals, communities, health-care facilities, markets, governments, etc. globally.
-- There is no specific treatment approved for COVID-19 or vaccine to prevent infection with the novel coronavirus.
-- During the urgent pandemic, media headlines the utility of drugs without solid evidence but buries the side-effects of these drugs.


What this study adds-- In this randomized clinical trial of patients mainly with persistent mild to moderate COVID-19, exposure to hydroxychloroquine led to a similar probability of virus elimination comparing to the current standard-of-care.
-- Adverse events, mostly gastrointestinal related, were significantly increased in patients who received hydroxychloroquine.
-- Overall, the results from our trial do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with persistent mild to moderate COVID-19.

19641,COVID-19 Risk Stratification and Mortality Prediction in Hospitalized Indian Patients,"The clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is highly variable with the vast majority recovering uneventfully but a small fraction progressing to severe disease and death. Appropriate and timely supportive care can reduce mortality and it is critical to evolve better patient risk stratification based on simple clinical data, so as to perform effective triage during strains on the healthcare infrastructure. This study presents risk stratification and mortality prediction models based on usual clinical data from 544 COVID-19 patients from New Delhi, India using machine learning methods. An XGboost classifier yielded the best performance on risk stratification (F1 score of 0.81). A logistic regression model yielded the best performance on mortality prediction (F1 score of 0.71). Significant biomarkers for predicting risk and mortality were identified. Examination of the data in comparison to a similar dataset with a Wuhan cohort of 375 patients was undertaken to understand the much lower mortality rates in India and the possible reasons thereof. The comparison indicated higher survival rate in the Delhi cohort even when patients had similar parameters as the Wuhan patients who died. Steroid administration was very frequent in Delhi patients, especially in surviving patients whose biomarkers indicated severe disease. This study helps in identifying the high-risk patient population and suggests treatment protocols that may be useful in countries with high mortality rates.","Alle, S.; Siddiqui, S.; Kanakan, A.; Garg, A.; Karthikeyan, A.; Mishra, N.; Waghdhare, S.; Tyagi, A.; Tarai, B.; Hazarika, P.

5924,Profiling COVID-19 pneumonia progressing into the cytokine storm syndrome: results from a single Italian Centre study on tocilizumab versus standard of care.,"ObjectiveApproximately 5% of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) develop a life-threatening pneumonia that often occurs in the setting of increased inflammation or ""cytokine storm"". Anti-cytokine treatments are being evaluated but optimal patient selection remains unclear, and the aim of our study is to address this point.

MethodsBetween February 29 to April 6, 2020, 111 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated in a single centre retrospective study. Patients were divided in two groups: 42 severe cases (TOCI) with adverse prognostic features including raised CRP and IL-6 levels, who underwent anti-cytokine treatments, mostly tocilizumab, and 69 standard of care patients (SOC).

ResultsIn the TOCI group, all received anti-viral therapy and 40% also received glucocorticoids. In TOCI, 62% of cases were ventilated and there were 3 deaths (17.8{+/-}10.6 days, mean follow up) with 7/26 cases remaining on ventilators, without improvement, and 17/26 developed bacterial superinfection. One fatality occurred in the 15 TOCI cases treated on noninvasive ventilation and 1 serious bacterial superinfection. Of the 69 cases in SOC, there was no fatalities and no bacterial complications. The TOCI group had higher baseline CRP and IL-6 elevations (p<0.0001 for both) and higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte levels (p= 0.04 and p=0.001, respectively) with the TOCI ventilated patients having higher markers than non-ventilated TOCI patients.

ConclusionHigher inflammatory markers, more infections and worse outcomes characterized ventilated TOCI cases compared to ward based TOCI. Despite the confounding factors, this suggests that therapy time in anti-cytokine randomized trials will be key.

19097,Bayesian back-calculation and nowcasting for line list data during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Surveillance is the key of controling the COVID-19 pandemic, and it typically suffers from reporting delays and thus can be misleading. Previous methods for adjusting reporting delays are not particularly appropriate for line list data, which usually have lots of missing values that are non-ignorable for modeling reporting delays. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian approach that dynamically integrates imputation and estimation for line list data. We show this Bayesian approach lead to accurate estimates of the epidemic curve and time-varying reproductive numbers and is robust to deviations from model assumptions. We apply the Bayesian approach to a COVID-19 line list data in Massachusetts and find the reproductive number estimates correspond more closely to the control measures than the ones based on the reported curve.","Li, T.; White, L.

We conducted 131 semi-structured phone interviews with households in rural Odisha, India to understand behavior changes made in WASH practices as a result of the pandemic and challenges that would prevent best practices. Interviews were conducted from May-July 2020 with 73 heads of household, 37 caregivers of children less than five years old, and 21 members of village water and sanitation committees in villages with community-level piped water and high levels of latrine ownership. The majority of respondents (86%, N=104) reported a change in their handwashing practice due to COVID-19 or the related government lockdown, typically describing an increase in handwashing frequency, more thorough washing method, and/or use of soap. These improved handwashing practices remained in place a few months after the pandemic began and were often described as a new consistent practice after additional daily actions (such as returning home), suggesting new habit formation. Few participants (13%) reported barriers to handwashing. Some respondents also detailed improvements in other WASH behaviors including village-level cleaning of water tanks and/or treatment of piped water (48% of villages), household water treatment and storage (17% of respondents), and household cleaning (41% of respondents). However, there was minimal change in latrine use and child feces management practices as a result of the pandemic. We provide detailed thematic summaries of qualitative responses to allow for richer insights into these WASH behavior changes, or lack thereof, during the pandemic. The results also highlight the importance of ensuring communities have adequate WASH infrastructure to enable the practice of safe behaviors and strengthen resilience during a large-scale health crisis.","Bauza, V.; Sclar, G.

It is safe to end social distancing if the majority of cases are detected early in the infection window. If cases are detected later, a 2-layer quarantine may be necessary to prevent resurgence.

6782,The British Thoracic Society survey of rehabilitation to support recovery of the Post Covid -19 population.,"ObjectivesThose discharged from hospital after treatment for Covid-19 are likely to have significant and ongoing symptoms, functional impairment and psychological disturbances. There is an immediate need to develop a safe and efficient discharge process and recovery programme. Pulmonary rehabilitation is well placed to deliver a rehabilitation programme for this group but will most likely need to be adapted for the post Covid-19 population. The purpose of this survey was to rapidly identify the components of a post-Covid-19 rehabilitation assessment and elements of a successful rehabilitation programme that would be required to deliver a comprehensive service for those post Covid-19 to inform service delivery.

DesignA survey comprising a series of closed questions and a free text comments box allowing for a qualitative analysis.

SettingOnline survey.

ParticipantsBritish Thoracic Society members and multi-professional clinicians, across specialities were invited to take part.

Results1031 participants responded from a broad range of specialities over 6 days. There was overwhelming support for early post discharge from hospital phase of the recovery programme to advise patients about the management of fatigue (95% agreed/ strongly agreed), breathlessness (94%), and mood disturbances (including symptoms of anxiety and depression) 92%. At the 6-8-week time point an assessment was considered important, focusing on the assessment of a broad range of possible symptoms and the need to potentially return to work. Recommendations for the intervention described a holistic programme focusing on symptom management, return of function and return to employment. The free text comments added depth to the survey and the need  not to reinvent the wheel rather adapt well established (pulmonary rehabilitation) services to accommodate the needs of the post Covid-19 population.

ConclusionThe responses indicate the huge interest and the urgent need establish a programme to support and mitigate the long term impact of Covid-19.

Strengths and limitationsO_LILarge and comprehensive survey conducted to guide the provision of post Covid-19 rehabilitation.
C_LIO_LIThe survey provides clear recommendations for the provision of advice and support immediately upon discharge, and recommendations for a programme of holistic rehabilitation 6-8 weeks post discharge based upon the existing pulmonary rehabilitation model.

19010,Association between RT-PCR Ct Values and COVID-19 New Daily Cases: A Multicenter Cross-Sectional Study,"IntroductionProactive prediction of the epidemiologic dynamics of viral diseases and outbreaks of the likes of COVID-19 has remained a difficult pursuit for scientists, public health researchers, and policymakers. It is unclear whether RT-PCR Cycle Threshold (Ct) values of COVID-19--or any other virus--as indicator of viral load, could represent a possible predictor for underlying epidemiologic changes on a population level.

ObjectivesTo investigate whether population-wide changes in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Ct values over time are associated with the daily fraction of positive COVID-19 tests. In addition, this study analyses the factors that could influence the RT-PCR Ct values.

MethodA retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 63,879 patients from May 4, 2020 to September 30, 2020, in all COVID-19 facilities in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Data collected included number of tests and newly diagnosed cases, as well as Ct values, age, gender nationality, and symptomatic status.

ResultsCt values were found to be negatively and very weakly correlated with the fraction of daily positive cases in the population r = -0.06 (CI95%: -0.06; -0.05; p=0.001). The R-squared for the regression model (adjusting for age and number of daily tests) showed an accuracy of 45.3%. Ct Values showed an association with nationality (p=0.012). After the stratification, the association between Ct values and the fraction of daily positive cases was only maintained for the female gender and Bahraini-nationality. Symptomatic presentation was significantly associated with lower Ct values (higher viral loads). Ct values do not show any correlation with age (p=0.333) or gender (p=0.522).

ConclusionWe report one of the first and largest studies to investigate the epidemiologic associations of Ct values with COVID-19. Ct values offer a potentially simple and widely accessible tool to predict and model epidemiologic dynamics on a population level. More population studies and predictive models from global cohorts are necessary.","Abdulrahman, A.; Mallah, S.; Alawadhi, A.

Here we show that Single Molecule Array assays detect seroconversion in COVID-19 patients as soon as one day after symptom onset using less than a microliter of blood. This multiplexed assay format allows us to quantitate IgG, IgM and IgA immunoglobulins against four SARS-CoV-2 targets, thereby interrogating 12 antibody isotype-viral protein interactions to give a high resolution profile of the immune response. Using a cohort of samples collected prior to the outbreak as well as samples collected during the pandemic, we demonstrate a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 100% during the first week of infection, and 100% sensitivity and specificity thereafter. This assay should become the gold standard for COVID19 serological profiling and will be a valuable tool for answering important questions about the heterogeneity of clinical presentation seen in the ongoing pandemic.","Norman, M.; Gilboa, T.; Ogata, A.

3936,The Immediate Effect of COVID-19 Policies on Social Distancing Behavior in the United States,"Anecdotal evidence points to the effectiveness of COVID-19 social distancing policies, however, their effectiveness vis-a-vis what is driven by public awareness and voluntary actions have not been studied. Policy variations across US states create a natural experiment to study the causal impact of each policy. Using a difference-in-differences methodology, location-based mobility, and daily state-level data on COVID-19 tests and confirmed cases, we rank policies based on their effectiveness. We show that statewide stay-at-home orders had the strongest causal impact on reducing social interactions. In contrast, most of the expected impact of more lenient policies were already reaped from non-policy mechanisms. Moreover, stay-at-home policy results in a steady decline in confirmed cases, starting from ten days after implementation and reaching a 37% decrease after fifteen days, consistent with the testing practices and incubation period of the disease.","Abouk, R.; Heydari, B.",2020-04-28,Health Policy,10.1101/2020.04.07.20057356,2,Babak Heydari,Northeastern University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20057356v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20057356v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1177/0033354920976575
5718,Modeling and Short-Term Forecasts of Indicators for COVID-19 Outbreak in 25 Countries at the end of March,"BackgroundThe coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, causing the disease called COVID-19, spread more than 200 countries and continents end of the March. There is a lot of data since the virus started. However, these data will be explanatory when accurate analyzes are made and will allow future predictions to be made. In this study, it was aimed to model the outbreak with different time series models and also predict the indicators.

MethodsThe data was collected from 25 countries which have different process at least 20 days. ARIMA(p,d,q), Simple Exponential Smoothing, Holts Two Parameter, Browns Double Exponential Smoothing Models were used. The prediction and forecasting values were obtained for the countries. Trends and seasonal effects were also evaluated.

ResultsChina has almost under control according to forecasting. The cumulative death prevalence in Italy and Spain will be the highest, followed by the Netherlands, France, England, China, Denmark, Belgium, Brazil and Sweden respectively as of the first week of April. The highest daily case prevalence was observed in Belgium, America, Canada, Poland, Ireland, Netherlands, France and Israel between 10% and 12%.The lowest rate was observed in China and South Korea. Turkey was one of the leading countries in terms of ranking these criteria. The prevalence of the new case and the recovered were higher in Spain than Italy.

ConclusionsMore accurate predictions for the future can be obtained using time series models with a wide range of data from different countries by modelling real time and retrospective data.","Ankarali, H.; Erarslan, N.; Pasin, O.",2020-05-01,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.26.20080754,1,Ozge Pasin,"Istanbul University, Biostatistics Department",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.20080754v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.20080754v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3329/bjms.v19i0.47611

14748,Socio-economic disparities and COVID-19 in the USA,"COVID-19 is not a universal killer. We study the spread of COVID-19 at the county level for the United States up until the 15th of August, 2020. We show that the prevalence of the disease and the death rate are correlated with the local socio-economic conditions often going beyond local population density distributions, especially in rural areas. We correlate the COVID-19 prevalence and death rate with data from the US Census Bureau and point out how the spreading patterns of the disease show asymmetries in urban and rural areas separately and is preferentially affecting the counties where a large fraction of the population is non-white. Our findings can be used for more targeted policy building and deployment of resources for future occurrence of a pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2. Our methodology, based on interpretable machine learning and game theory, can be extended to study the spread of other diseases.","Paul, A.; Englert, P.; Varga, M.",2020-09-11,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.10.20192138,1,Ayan Paul,"DESY, Hamburg & Humboldt Universitat zu Berlin",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.20192138v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.20192138v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
20245,"Vulnerabilities in child wellbeing among primary school children: a cross-sectional study in Bradford, UK","ObjectiveTo describe the prevalence of factors related to wellbeing among primary school children in a deprived multi-ethnic community.

Design and participantsCross-sectional survey of 15,641 children aged 7-10 years in Born in Bradfords Primary School Years study: whole-classroom samples in 89 Bradford primary schools between 2016 and 2019.

Main outcome measuresPrevalence estimates by ethnicity (%, 95% CI) of single and multiple vulnerabilities in child wellbeing within and across four domains (home, family, relationships; material resources; friends and school; subjective wellbeing).

ResultsOnly 10% of children have no vulnerabilities in any domain of wellbeing; 10% have one or more vulnerabilities in all four domains. The highest prevalence estimates were for being bullied some or all of the time (52.7%, 51.9 to 53.4%), keeping worries to oneself (31.2%, 30.5 to 31.9%), having no park near home (30.8%, 30.1 to 31.5%) and worrying all the time about how much money their family has (26.3%, 25.6 to 27%).

Boys were consistently significantly more likely than girls to report all of the vulnerabilities in the Home, Family and Family Relationships domain, and the majority of indicators in the other domains, and in all domains except Friends and School, boys were significantly more likely to have at least one vulnerability. Girls were significantly more likely to report not having many friends (16.7%, 95% CI: 15.9 to 17.6% vs. 12.5%, 95% CI: 11.8 to 13.2%), being bullied some or all of the time (55.8%, 95% CI: 54.7 to 56.9% vs. 49.7%, 95% CI: 48.6 to 50.8%) and feeling left out all the time (12.1%, 95% CI: 11.4 to 12.8%) vs. 10.3%, 95% CI: 9.7 to 11.0%).

Variations in vulnerabilities by ethnicity were complex, with children in Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic groups sometimes reporting more vulnerabilities and sometimes fewer than White British children. For example, compared to children of Pakistani heritage, White British children were more likely to say that their family never gets along well (6.3%,5.6 to 7.1% vs. 4.1%,3.6 to 4.6%) and to have no access to the internet at home (22.3%,21 to 23.6% vs. 18%,17 to 18.9%). Children with Pakistani heritage were more likely than White British children to say they had no park near their home where they can play with friends (32.7%,31.6 to 33.9% vs. 29.9%,28.6 to 31.3%), to report not having three meals a day (17.9%,16.9 to 18.8% vs. 11.9%,10.9 to 12.9%) and to worry all the time about how much money their families have (29.3%,28.2 to 30.3%) vs. 21.6%,20.4 to 22.9%). Gypsy/Irish Traveller children were less likely than White British children to say they were bullied some or all of the time (42.2%,35.4 to 49.4% vs. 53.8%,52.3 to 55.3%), but more likely to say they were mean to others all the time (9.9%,6.3 to 15.2% vs. 4%,3.5 to 4.7%) and can never work out what to do when things are hard (15.2%,10.6 to 21.2% vs. 9%, 8.2 to 9.9%).

We considered six vulnerabilities to be of particular concern during the current Covid-19 pandemic and associated national and local lockdowns: family never gets along well together; no garden where child can play; no nearby park where they can play; not having 3 meals a day; no internet at home; worried about money all the time. Pre-pandemic, 37.4% (36.6 to 38.3%) of Bradford children had one of these vulnerabilities and a further 29.6% (28.9 to 30.4%) had more than one.

ConclusionsAlthough most primary school children aged 7-10 in our study have good levels of wellbeing on most indicators across multiple domains, fewer than 10% have no vulnerabilities at all, a worrying 10% have at least one vulnerability in all the four domains we studied and two thirds have vulnerabilities of concern during the Covid-19 lockdowns.","Pickett, K.

19919,Comparative Study - The Impact and Profile of COVID-19 Patients Who Are Indicated for Neuroimaging: Vascular Phenomena Are Been Found in the Brain and Olfactory Bulbs,"ObjectiveTo verify the impact and findings of the COVID-19 patients group that underwent brain scans in comparison to the group which only chest CT was performed.

Method876 suspected COVID-19 patients and a subsample of 232 cases with confirmed COVID-19 who underwent brain CT/MRI scan (n=35) or only chest CT (n=197) in two radiology departments, were evaluated.

Results5.59% of all suspected COVID-19 patients found had brain scans and 98.74% chest CT. There was a statistically significant difference with associations regarding the COVID-19 brain scan group for: admission to ICU, greater severity of lung injuries, the use of mechanical ventilator, seizure, sepsis, and stroke and statistical tendency for chronic renal failure and systemic arterial hypertension. 40.0% of COVID-19 patients from the brain scan group were abnormal on brain CT and/or brain MRI. 22.9% cases with any kind of bleeding or microbleeding, 8.6% with restricted diffusion lesions. One ischemic stroke case was associated with irregularity at M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery. There was a case of left facial nerve palsy with enhancement of left geniculate ganglia. An analyse of the olfactory bulbs was possible in 12 brain MRIs and 100% had enhancement and/or microbleeding. There was no statistical difference regarding death (9.1% versus 5.2%).

In conclusionthe COVID-19 patients group on which brain CT and/or MRI needed to be performed was statically associated with the more severe COVID-19 disease, an indication to ICU, a more severe form of lung disease, use of mechanical ventilator, seizure, sepsis and stroke. Less than half of patients had abnormal brain imaging scans with all of them showing vascular brain injury lesion, being more frequently microbleeding or bleeding, followed by restricted diffusion lesions. All the olfactory bulbs evaluated showed injury by vascular phenomenon, probably methahemoglobine by microbleeding or microthrombus and/or abnormal enhancement","Aragao, M. D. F. V. V.; Leal, M.

14168,The Uncertain COVID-19 Spread Pattern in India: A Statistical Analysis of the Current Situation,"There are standard techniques of forecasting the spread of pandemics. Uncertainty however is always associated with such forecasts. In this article, we are going to discuss the uncertain situation currently prevailing in the COVID-19 spread in India. For statistical analysis, we have considered the total number of cases for 60 consecutive days, from June 23 to August 21. We have seen that instead of taking data of all 60 days together, a better picture of uncertainty can be observed if we consider the data separately in three equal parts from June 23 to July 12, from July 13 to August 1, and from August 2 to August 21. For that we would first need to ascertain that the current spread pattern in India is almost exponential. Thereafter we shall show that the data regarding the total number of cases in India are not really behaving in an expected way, making forecasting the time to peak very difficult. We have found that the pandemic would perhaps change its pattern of growth from nearly exponential to nearly logarithmic, which we have earlier observed in the case of Italy, in less than 78 days starting from August 2.","Baruah, H.

16829,Mortality among Adults Ages 25-44 in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"IntroductionCoronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has caused a marked increase in all-cause deaths in the United States, mostly among adults aged 65 and older. Because younger adults have far lower infection fatality rates, less attention has been focused on the mortality burden of COVID-19 in this demographic.

MethodsWe performed an observational cohort study using public data from the National Center for Health Statistics at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and CDC Wonder. We analyzed all-cause mortality among adults ages 25-44 during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Further, we compared COVID-19-related deaths in this age group during the pandemic period to all drug overdose deaths and opioid-specific overdose deaths in each of the ten Health and Human Services (HHS) regions during the corresponding period of 2018, the most recent year for which data are available.

ResultsAs of September 6, 2020, 74,027 all-cause deaths occurred among persons ages 25-44 years during the period from March 1st to July 31st, 2020, 14,155 more than during the same period of 2019, a 23% relative increase (incident rate ratio 1.23; 95% CI 1.21-1.24), with a peak of 30% occurring in May (IRR 1.30; 95% CI 1.27-1.33). In HHS Region 2 (New York, New Jersey), HHS Region 6 (Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas), and HHS Region 9 (Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada), COVID-19 deaths exceeded 2018 unintentional opioid overdose deaths during at least one month. Combined, 2,450 COVID-19 deaths were recorded in these three regions during the pandemic period, compared to 2,445 opioid deaths during the same period of 2018.

MeaningWe find that COVID-19 has likely become the leading cause of death--surpassing unintentional overdoses--among young adults aged 25-44 in some areas of the United States during substantial COVID-19 outbreaks.

NoteThe data presented here have since been updated. As a result, an additional 1,902 all-cause deaths occurring among US adults ages 25-44 during the period of interest are not accounted for in this manuscript.","Faust, J.

16180,Global projections of potential lives saved from COVID-19 through universal mask use,"BACKGROUNDSocial distancing mandates (SDM) have reduced health impacts from COVID-19 but also resulted in economic downturns that have led many nations to relax SDM. Until deployment of an efficacious and equitable vaccine, intervention options to reduce COVID-19 mortality and minimize restrictive SDM are sought by society.

METHODSA susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) deterministic transmission model was parameterized with data on reported deaths, cases, and select covariates to predict infections and deaths from COVID-19 through March 01, 2021. We explore three scenarios: a ""non-adaptive"" scenario where neither mask use or SDM adapt to changing conditions, a ""reference"" where current national levels of mask use are maintained and SDM reintroduced when deaths rise, and an increase in mask use to 95% coverage levels (""universal mask""). We reviewed published studies to set priors on the magnitude of reduction in transmission through increasing mask use.

RESULTSMask use was estimated at 59.0% of people globally on October 19, 2020. Universal mask use could avert 733,310 deaths (95% UI 385,981 to 1,107,759) between October 27, 2020 and March 01, 2021, the difference between the predicted 2.95 million deaths (95% UI 2.70 to 3.35) in the reference scenario and 2.22 million deaths (95% UI 2.00 to 2.45) in the universal mask scenario over this time period.

CONCLUSIONSThe cumulative toll of the COVID-19 pandemic could be substantially reduced by the universal adoption of masks before the availability of a vaccine. This low-cost, low-barrier policy, whether customary or mandated, has enormous health benefits with presumed marginal economic costs.","Gakidou, E.; Ihme Covid-19 Forecasting Team,  ",2020-11-18,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.10.08.20209510,2,Emmanuela Gakidou,IHME,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.08.20209510v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.08.20209510v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
16508,"Medium-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on multiple vital organs, exercise capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health, post-hospital discharge","BackgroundThe medium-term effects of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on multiple organ health, exercise capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health are poorly understood.

MethodsFifty-eight COVID-19 patients post-hospital discharge and 30 comorbidity-matched controls were prospectively enrolled for multiorgan (brain, lungs, heart, liver and kidneys) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spirometry, six-minute walk test, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), quality of life, cognitive and mental health assessments.

FindingsAt 2-3 months from disease-onset, 64% of patients experienced persistent breathlessness and 55% complained of significant fatigue. On MRI, tissue signal abnormalities were seen in the lungs (60%), heart (26%), liver (10%) and kidneys (29%) of patients. COVID-19 patients also exhibited tissue changes in the thalamus, posterior thalamic radiations and sagittal stratum on brain MRI and demonstrated impaired cognitive performance, specifically in the executive and visuospatial domain relative to controls. Exercise tolerance (maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency on CPET) and six-minute walk distance (405{+/-}118m vs 517{+/-}106m in controls, p<0.0001) were significantly reduced in patients. The extent of extra-pulmonary MRI abnormalities and exercise tolerance correlated with serum markers of ongoing inflammation and severity of acute illness. Patients were more likely to report symptoms of moderate to severe anxiety (35% versus 10%, p=0.012) and depression (39% versus 17%, p=0.036) and a significant impairment in all domains of quality of life compared to controls.

InterpretationA significant proportion of COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital experience ongoing symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, anxiety, depression and exercise limitation at 2-3 months from disease-onset. Persistent lung and extra-pulmonary organ MRI findings are common. In COVID-19 survivors, chronic inflammation may underlie multiorgan abnormalities and contribute to impaired quality of life.

4367,Cardiovascular Diseases Burden in COVID-19: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"BackgroundHigh rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been reported among patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Meanwhile there were controversies among different studies about CVD burden in COVID-19 patients. Hence, we aimed to study CVD burden among COVID-19 patients, using a systematic review and meta-analysis.

MethodsWe have systematically searched databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science as well as medRxiv pre-print database. Hand searched was also conducted in journal websites and Google Scholar. Meta-analyses were carried out for Odds Ratio (OR) of mortality and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission for different CVDs. We have also performed a descriptive meta-analysis on different CVDs.

ResultsFifty-six studies entered into meta-analysis for ICU admission and mortality outcome and 198 papers for descriptive outcomes, including 159,698 COVID-19 patients. Results of meta-analysis indicated that acute cardiac injury, (OR: 13.29, 95% CI 7.35-24.03), hypertension (OR: 2.60, 95% CI 2.11-3.19), heart Failure (OR: 6.72, 95% CI 3.34-13.52), arrhythmia (OR: 2.75, 95% CI 1.43-5.25), coronary artery disease (OR: 3.78, 95% CI 2.42-5.90), and cardiovascular disease (OR: 2.61, 95% CI 1.89-3.62) were significantly associated with mortality. Arrhythmia (OR: 7.03, 95% CI 2.79-17.69), acute cardiac injury (OR: 15.58, 95% CI 5.15-47.12), coronary heart disease (OR: 2.61, 95% CI 1.09-6.26), cardiovascular disease (OR: 3.11, 95% CI 1.59-6.09), and hypertension (OR: 1.95, 95% CI 1.41-2.68) were also significantly associated with ICU admission in COVID-19 patients.

ConclusionFindings of this study revealed a high burden of CVDs among COVID-19 patients, which was significantly associated with mortality and ICU admission. Proper management of CVD patients with COVID-19 and monitoring COVID-19 patients for acute cardiac conditions is highly recommended to prevent mortality and critical situations.

6348,IDentif.AI: Artificial Intelligence Pinpoints Remdesivir in Combination with Ritonavir and Lopinavir as an Optimal Regimen Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to the rapid initiation of urgently needed clinical trials of repurposed drug combinations and monotherapies. These regimens were primarily relying on mechanism-of-action based selection of drugs, many of which have yielded positive in vitro but largely negative clinical outcomes. To overcome this challenge, we report the use of IDentif.AI, a platform that rapidly optimizes infectious disease (ID) combination therapy design using artificial intelligence (AI). In this study, IDentif.AI was implemented on a 12-drug candidate therapy search set representing over 530,000 possible drug combinations. IDentif.AI demonstrated that the optimal combination therapy against SARS-CoV-2 was comprised of remdesivir, ritonavir, and lopinavir, which mediated a 6.5-fold improvement in efficacy over remdesivir alone. Additionally, IDentif.AI showed hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to be relatively ineffective. The identification of a clinically actionable optimal drug combination was completed within two weeks, with a 3-order of magnitude reduction in the number of tests typically needed. IDentif.AI analysis was also able to independently confirm clinical trial outcomes to date without requiring any data from these trials. The robustness of the IDentif.AI platform suggests that it may be applicable towards rapid development of optimal drug regimens to address current and future outbreaks.","Blasiak, A.; Lim, J.

20219,An Augmented SEIR Model with Protective and Hospital Quarantine Dynamics for the Control of COVID-19 Spread,"In this work, an attempt is made to analyse the dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak mathematically using a modified SEIR model with additional compartments and a nonlinear incidence rate with the help of bifurcation theory. Existence of a forward bifurcation point is presented by deriving conditions in terms of parameters for the existence of disease free and endemic equilibrium points. The significance of having two additional compartments, viz., protective and hospital quarantine compartments, is then illustrated via numerical simulations. From the analysis and results, it is observed that, by properly selecting transfer functions to place exposed and infected individuals in protective and hospital quarantine compartments, respectively, and with apt governmental action, it is possible to contain the COVID-19 spread effectively. Finally, the capability of the proposed model in predicting/representing the COVID-19 dynamics is presented by comparing with real-time data.","G., R.",2021-01-09,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.01.08.21249467,1,Rohith G.,Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.08.21249467v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.08.21249467v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
8389,"Study protocol for COvid-19 Vascular sERvice (COVER) study: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision, practice and outcomes of vascular surgery","BackgroundThe novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a profound impact on global healthcare. Shortages in staff, operating theatre space and intensive care beds has led to a significant reduction in the provision of surgical care. Even vascular surgery, often insulated from resource scarcity due to its status as an urgent specialty, has limited capacity due to the pandemic. Furthermore, many vascular surgical patients are elderly with multiple comorbidities putting them at increased risk of COVID-19 and its complications. There is an urgent need to investigate the impact on patients presenting to vascular surgeons during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods and AnalysisThe COvid-19 Vascular sERvice (COVER) study has been designed to investigate the worldwide impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vascular surgery, at both service provision and individual patient level. COVER is running as a collaborative study through the Vascular and Endovascular Research Network (VERN) with the support of numerous national (Vascular Society of Great Britain and Ireland, British Society of Endovascular Therapy, British Society of Interventional Radiology, Rouleaux Club) and an evolving number of international organisations (Vascupedia, SingVasc, Audible Bleeding (USA), Australian and New Zealand Vascular Trials Network (ANZVTN)). The study has 3  Tiers: Tier 1 is a survey of vascular surgeons to capture longitudinal changes to the provision of vascular services within their hospital; Tier 2 captures data on vascular and endovascular procedures performed during the pandemic; and Tier 3 will capture any deviations to patient management strategies from prepandemic best practice. Data submission and collection will be electronic using online survey tools (Tier 1: SurveyMonkey(R) for service provision data) and encrypted data capture forms (Tiers 2 and 3: REDCap(R) for patient level data). Tier 1 data will undergo real-time serial analysis to determine longitudinal changes in practice, with country-specific analyses also performed. The analysis of Tier 2 and Tier 3 data will occur on completion of the study as per the prespecified statistical analysis plan.

Ethical ApprovalEthical approval from the UK Health Research Authority has been obtained for Tiers 2 and 3 (20/NW/0196 Liverpool Central). Participating centres in the UK will be required to seek local research and development approval. Non-UK centres will need to obtain a research ethics committee or institutional review board approvals in accordance with national and/or local requirements.

17870,"Performance of Saliva, Oropharyngeal Swabs, and Nasal Swabs for SARS-CoV-2 Molecular Detection: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","BackgroundNasopharyngeal (NP) swabs are considered the highest-yield sample for diagnostic testing for respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The need to increase capacity for SARS-CoV-2 testing in a variety of settings, combined with shortages of sample collection supplies, have motivated a search for alternative sample types with high sensitivity. We systematically reviewed the literature to understand the performance of alternative sample types compared to NP swabs.

MethodsWe systematically searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv (last retrieval October 1st, 2020) for comparative studies of alternative specimen types [saliva, oropharyngeal (OP), and nasal (NS) swabs] versus NP swabs for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). A logistic-normal random-effects meta-analysis was performed to calculate % positive alternative-specimen, % positive NP, and % dual positives overall and in sub-groups. The QUADAS 2 tool was used to assess bias.

ResultsFrom 1,253 unique citations, we identified 25 saliva, 11 NS, 6 OP, and 4 OP/NS studies meeting inclusion criteria. Three specimen types captured lower % positives [NS (0.82, 95% CI: 0.73-0.90), OP (0.84, 95% CI: 0.57-1.0), saliva (0.88, 95% CI: 0.81 - 0.93)] than NP swabs, while combined OP/NS matched NP performance (0.97, 95% CI: 0.90-1.0). Absence of RNA extraction (saliva) and utilization of a more sensitive NAAT (NS) substantially decreased alternative-specimen yield.

ConclusionsNP swabs remain the gold standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, although alternative specimens are promising. Much remains unknown about the impact of variations in specimen collection, processing protocols, and population (pediatric vs. adult, late vs. early in disease course) and head-to head studies of sampling strategies are urgently needed.","Lee, R.

18199,Two independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the Iranian outbreak,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been rapidly spreading globally since December 2019, triggering a pandemic, soon after its emergence, with now more than one million deaths around the world. While Iran was among the first countries confronted with rapid spread of virus in February, no real-time SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome tracking is performed in the country.

To address this issue, we provided 50 whole-genome sequences of viral isolates ascertained from different geographical locations in Iran during March-July 2020. The corresponding analysis on origins, transmission dynamics and genetic diversity, represented at least two introductions of the virus into the country, constructing two major clusters defined as B.4 and B.1*. The first entry of the virus occurred around 26 December 2019, as suggested by the time to the most recent common ancestor, followed by a rapid community transmission, led to dominancy of B.4 lineage in early epidemic till the end of June. Gradually, reduction in dominancy of B.4 occurred possibly as a result of other entries of the virus, followed by surge of B.1.* lineages, as of mid-May.

Remarkably, variation tracking of the virus indicated the increase in frequency of D614G mutation, along with B.1* lineages, which showed continuity till October 2020.

According to possible role of D614G in increased infectivity and transmission of the virus, and considering the current high prevalence of the disease, dominancy of this lineage may push the country into a critical health situation. Therefore, current data warns for considering stronger prohibition strategies preventing the incidence of larger crisis in future.","Fattahi, Z.; Mohseni, M.; Jalalvand, K.; Aghakhani Moghadam, F.; Ghaziasadi, A.; Keshavarzi, F.; Yavarian, J.; Jafarpour, A.; Mortazavi, S.

3382,How will this continue? Modelling interactions between the COVID-19 pandemic and policy responses,"Much of the uncertainty about the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic stems from questions about when and how non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) by governments, in particular social distancing measures, are implemented, to what extent the population complies with these measures, and how compliance changes through time. Further uncertainty comes from a lack of knowledge of the potential effects of removing interventions once the epidemic is declining. By combining an epidemiological model of COVID-19 for the United Kingdom with simple sub-models for these societal processes, this study aims to shed light on the conceivable trajectories that the pandemic might follow over the next 1.5 years. We show strong improvements in outcomes if governments review NPI more frequently whereas, in comparison, the stability of compliance has surprisingly small effects on cumulative mortality. Assuming that mortality does considerably increase once a countrys hospital capacity is breached, we show that the inherent randomness of societal processes can lead to a wide range of possible outcomes, both in terms of disease dynamics and mortality, even when the principles according to which policy and population operate are identical.. Our model is easily modified to take other aspects of the socio-pandemic interaction into account.","Rossberg, A. G.; Knell, R.

11574,Coagulopathy in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Patients with COVID-19 frequently manifest coagulation abnormalities and thrombotic events. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to explore the role of coagulopathy on the severity differences in patients with COVID-19. We conducted systematic literature search via Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, WanFang Database, CNKI, and medRxiv from December 1, 2019 to May 1, 2020, to identify all original studies that reports on coagulation parameters (D-dimer, PLT, PT, APTT, and FIB) during COVID-19 infection. Thereafter, we compared the coagulation parameters between less severe and more severe cases. All Statistical analyses were performed via Stata14.0 software. A total of 3,952 confirmed COVID-19 infected patients were included from 25 studies. Patients with severe COVID-19 infection exhibited significantly higher levels of D-dimer, PT, and FIB (SMD 0.83, 95% CI: 0.70-0.97, I2 56.9%; SMD 0.39, 95% CI: 0.14-0.64, I2 77.9%; SMD 0.35, 95% CI: 0.17-0.53, I242.4% respectively). However, difference in PLT and APTT levels between less severe and more severe patients was not statistically significant (SMD-0.26, 95% CI:-0.56-0.05, I2 82.2%; SMD-0.14,95% CI: -0.45-0.18, I2 75.5% respectively) This meta-analysis revealed coagulopathy is associated with the severity of COVID-19.

5242,The spatio-temporal epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak in Africa,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. Although, the disease appears on the African continent late, it has spread to virtually all the countries. We provide early spatio-temporal dynamics of COVID-19 within the first 62 days of the diseases appearance on the African continent. We used a two-parameter hurdle Poisson model to simultaneously analyze the zero counts and the frequency of occurrence. We investigate the effects of important healthcare capacities including hospital beds and number of medical doctors in the different countries. The results show that cases of the pandemic vary geographically across Africa with notable high incidence in neighboring countries particularly in West and North Africa. The burden of the disease (per 100,000) was most felt in Djibouti Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria. Temporally, during the first 4 weeks, the burden was highest in Senegal, Egypt and Mauritania, but by mid-April it shifted to Somalia, Chad, Guinea, Tanzania, Gabon, Sudan, and Zimbabwe. Currently, Namibia, Angola, South Sudan, Burundi and Uganda have the least burden. The findings could be useful in implementing epidemiological intervention and allocation of scarce resources based on heterogeneity of the disease patterns.","Gayawan, E.; Awe, O.; Oseni, B.

AimTo report clinical features and outcomes associated to Covid-19 in a group of patients admitted during the first wave in a regional reference Center in southern Chile designated to severe and critical cases.

MethodsCases were identified by a compatible clinical picture associated to positive RT-PCR or serological testing. A standard protocol was applied.

Results21 adult patients (20 diagnosed by PCR, one by serology) were admitted between epidemiological weeks 13 to 20, involving 8.8% of total regional cases. Hospitalization occurred at a median of 11 days after symptoms onset. Patients [&ge;]60 years old predominated (57.1%). Hypertension (61.9%), obesity (57.1%) and diabetes mellitus 2 (38.1%) were prevalent but 19% had no comorbid conditions nor were elderly. Two cases involved second-trimester pregnant women. Positive IgM or IgM/IgG results obtained by rapid serological testing were limited (19% at 1st week; 42.9% at 2nd week). Nine patients (42.9%, critical group) were transferred to ICU and connected to mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. By univariate analysis admission to ICU was significantly associated to tachypnea and higher plasmatic LDH values.

Motivated by the need to optimise cortisol replacement in the situations of COVID-19 infection, the model is fitted to recently-published data on 50 mg dosing and earlier data on 10 mg dosing. The fitted model is used to predict typical responses to standard dosing regimes, which involve a larger dose in the morning and 1 or 2 smaller doses later in the day, and the same regimes with doses doubled. In all cases there is a circadian-like response, with early morning nadir. The model is also used to consider an alternative dosing strategy based on four equal and equally-spaced doses of 10, 20 or 30 mg per 24 h, resulting in a more even response resembling a response to sustained inflammatory stress.","Smith, D.

6499,Covid-19 Pandemic in relation to levels of Pollution with PM2.5 and Ambient Salinity. An Environmental Wake-up Call,"INTRODUCTIONCovid-19 infection continues to be a source of great loss of life and global suffering, necessitating national lockdowns. There are however some countries and cities which appear to have contained the pandemic. Common to these countries are environmental factors including the levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) and ambient salinity.

METHODPM2.5 and ambient salinity were assessed in a number of cities, differentially affected by Covid-19 infection. The cities chosen to be assessed were divided into two groups. The first group included cities having significantly high rates of Covid-19 infection, while the second group consisted of coastal cities or small island countries, all of which have low rates of Covid-19 infection. Minimum and maximum levels of PM2.5 were obtained from the Air Quality Index, one month before and one month after statutory lockdown. Salinity levels were obtained from a study that assessed chloride ion wet deposition, a surrogate for ambient salinity.

RESULTSOne month prior to the statutory national lock-down or mandatory restrictions, there appear to be high levels of particulate matter, PM2.5 (min-max 67.4 - 118.7 AQI), in countries which had a high incidence of Covid-19 infection compared to lower levels in countries that have contained the infection (min-max 45.6 - 79.8) (p<0.046). One month after national restrictions there still appeared to be higher levels of particulate matter, PM2.5 (min-max 51 - 90.5 AQI), in countries which had a high incidence of Covid-19 infection compared to countries that have contained the infection (min-max 42.7 - 69.5 AQI) but this was not statistically significant.

There seemed to be an inverse relationship between Covid-19 infection and ambient salinity levels. Countries that were spared high Covid-19 infection rates, besides their geographical isolation, also have higher ambient salinity levels (124 - 617mgCl/m2/TAG) compared to salinity levels noted in countries with high Covid-19 rates of infection (28.4 - 162. mgCl/m2/TAG) (p<0.003).

CONCLUSIONHigh levels of PM2.5 in the presence of low ambient salinity may increase the risk of Covid-19 infection in the population. Addressing these two environmental factors may attenuate the severity of the pandemic.","Muscat Baron, Y.",2020-05-08,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.03.20087056,1,Yves Muscat Baron,"Mater Dei Hospital, Medical School of Malta",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20087056v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20087056v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
9747,"Publish or perish: Reporting Characteristics of Peer-reviewed publications, pre-prints and registered studies on the COVID-19 pandemic","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a mass of academic papers being published in a very brief span of time. Our aim was to compare the amount and reporting characteristics of COVID-19 related peer-reviewed and pre-prints publications. We also investigated the amount of ongoing trials and systematic reviews.

Methods and findingsA cross-sectional study of publications covering the COVID-19 pandemic time frame, up to May 20, 2020 was conducted. PubMed with appropriate combinations of Medical Subject Headings and COVID-19 section of MedRxiv and BioRxiv archives were searched. We examined Clinicaltrial.gov, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, EU Register and 15 other trial registers as well as the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO). Characteristics of each publication source were extracted. Regression analyses and Z tests were used to analyze publication trends over the weeks and compare their relative proportions.

We found 3635 peer-reviewed publications and 3805 pre-prints, of which 8.6% (n=329) were published in indexed journals. Peer-reviewed and pre-print publications amount both increased significantly over time (p<0.001). Case reports (peer-reviewed: 6% vs pre-prints: 0.9%, p<0.001) and letters (17.4% vs 0.5%, p<0.001) accounted for a greater share of the peer-reviewed compared to pre-print publications. In turn, randomized controlled trials (0.22% vs 0.63% p<0.001) and systematic reviews (0.08% vs 5%) accounted for a significantly greater share of the pre-print publications. Clinicaltrials.gov, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and EU register included 57.9%, 49.5 % and 98.9% trials mostly still ""recruiting"". PROSPERO amounted to 962 systematic review protocols.

ConclusionPre-prints were slightly more prevalent than peer-reviewed publications, yet both are growing.

2996,Modes of contact and risk of transmission in COVID-19 among close contacts,"BackgroundRapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan prompted heightened surveillance in Guangzhou and elsewhere in China. Modes of contact and risk of transmission among close contacts have not been well estimated.

MethodsWe included 4950 closes contacts from Guangzhou, and extracted data including modes of contact, laboratory testing, clinical characteristics of confirmed cases and source cases. We used logistic regression analysis to explore the risk factors associated with infection of close contacts.

ResultsAmong 4950 closes contacts, the median age was 38.0 years, and males accounted for 50.2% (2484). During quarantine period, 129 cases (2.6%) were diagnosed, with 8 asymptomatic (6.2%), 49 mild (38.0%), and 5 (3.9%) severe to critical cases. The sensitivity of throat swab was 71.32% and 92.19% at first to second PCR test. Among different modes of contact, household contacts were the most dangerous in catching with infection of COVID-19, with an incidence of 10.2%. As the increase of age for close contacts and severity of source cases, the incidence of COVID-19 presented an increasing trend from 1.8% (0-17 years) to 4.2% (60 or over years), and from 0.33% for asymptomatic, 3.3% for mild, to 6.2% for severe and critical source cases, respectively. Manifestation of expectoration in source cases was also highly associated with an increased risk of infection in their close contacts (13.6%). Secondary cases were in general clinically milder and were less likely to have common symptoms than those of source cases.

ConclusionsIn conclusion, the proportion of asymptomatic and mild infections account for almost half of the confirmed cases among close contacts. The household contacts were the main transmission mode, and clinically more severe cases were more likely to pass the infection to their close contacts. Generally, the secondary cases were clinically milder than those of source cases.","Luo, L.; Liu, D.; Liao, X.-L.; Wu, X.-B.; Jing, Q.-L.; Zheng, J.-Z.; Liu, F.-H.; Yang, S.-G.; Bi, B.; Li, Z.-H.; Liu, J.-P.; Song, W.-Q.; Zhu, W.; Wang, Z.-H.; Zhang, X.-R.; Chen, P.-L.; Liu, H.-M.; Cheng, X.; Cai, M.-C.; Huang, Q.-M.; Yang, P.; Yang, X.-F.; Huang, Z.-G.; Tang, J.-L.; Ma, Y.; Mao, C.",2020-03-26,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.24.20042606,1,Chen Mao,"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042606v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042606v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
17905,Protective behaviours and secondary harms from non-pharmaceutical interventions during the COVID-19 epidemic in South Africa: a multisite prospective longitudinal study,"BackgroundIn March 2020 South Africa implemented strict non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to contain Covid-19. Over the subsequent five months NPIs were eased in stages according to national strategy. Covid-19 spread throughout the country heterogeneously, reaching rural areas by July and peaking in July-August. Data on the impact of NPI policies on social and economic wellbeing and access to healthcare is limited. We therefore analysed how rural residents of three South African provinces changed their behaviour during the first epidemic wave.

MethodsThe South African Population Research Infrastructure Network (SAPRIN) nodes in Mpumalanga (Agincourt), KwaZulu-Natal (AHRI) and Limpopo (DIMAMO) provinces conducted longitudinal telephone surveys among randomly sampled households from rural and peri-urban surveillance populations every 2-3 weeks. Interviews included questions on: Covid-19 knowledge and behaviours; health and economic impact of NPIs; and mental health.

Results2262 households completed 10,966 interviews between April and August 2020. By August, self-reported satisfaction with Covid-19 knowledge had risen from 48% to 85% and facemask use to over 95%. As selected NPIs were eased mobility increased, and economic losses and anxiety and depression symptoms fell. When Covid-19 cases spiked at one node in July, movement dropped rapidly, and missed daily medication rates doubled. Economic concerns and mental health symptoms were lower in households receiving a greater number of government-funded old-age pensions.

ConclusionsSouth Africans reported complying with stringent Covid-19 NPIs despite the threat of substantial social, economic and health repercussions. Government-supported social welfare programmes appeared to buffer interruptions in income and healthcare access during local outbreaks. Epidemic control policies must be balanced against impacts on wellbeing in resource-limited settings and designed with parallel support systems where they threaten income and basic service access.","Harling, G.; Gomez-Olive, F.

18996,The Testing Multiplier: Fear vs Containment,"This paper studies the economic effects of testing during the outbreak of a novel epidemic disease. I propose a model where testing permits isolation of the infected and provides agents with information about the prevalence and lethality of the disease. Additional testing reduces the perceived lethality of the disease, but might increase the perceived risk of infection. As a result, more testing could increase the perceived risk of dying from the disease - i.e. ""stoke fear"" - and cause a fall in economic activity, despite improving health outcomes. Two main insights emerge. First, increased testing is beneficial to the economy and pays for itself if performed at a sufficiently large scale, but not necessarily otherwise. Second, heterogeneous risk perceptions across age-groups can have important aggregate consequences. For a SARS-CoV-2 calibration of the model, heterogeneous risk perceptions across young and old individuals mitigate GDP losses by 50% and reduce the death toll by 30% relative to a scenario in which all individuals have the same perceptions of risk.","Furno, F.",2020-12-08,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.12.06.20244947,1,Francesco Furno,New York University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.06.20244947v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.06.20244947v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
5659,Methods of An Open-Label Proof-Of-Concept Trial of Intravenous Valproic Acid for Severe COVID-19,"IntroductionCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the systemic entity caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that may cause death through severe atypical pneumonia and acute lung injury. Valproic acid (VPA) has shown anti-inflammatory activity and mild intrinsic antiviral effect. These properties warrant the study of VPA as a possible active treatment in persons with severe COVID-19.

MethodsConsecutive adult patients needing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) will be given intravenous (i.v.) VPA at a starting dose of 20 mg/kg/day and up to 60/kg/day (in 60 min i.v. infusions in 250 mL normal saline) as needed to reach plasma VPA concentrations of 50-100 g/mL (measured every 72 h). These patients will be followed-up for 10 days for the primary outcome and for a further period of 30 days after treatment completion for the secondary outcome of recurrence. The primary study outcome is the reduction in the case fatality rate of at least 50% after 10 days of treatment (as compared with natural history). Secondary outcomes are the reduction of length of stay (LOS) of at least 50%, as well as COVID-19 recurrence at 30-day follow-up. The most important safety outcomes are acute liver failure, acute pancreatitis, and thrombocytopenia.

ConclusionAlthough long-term adverse effects and even pro-inflammatory consequences have been reported with the chronic use of VPA, given the urgent need for a drug against COVID-19 to shorten the high mortality and LOS, the study of VPA is justified from a scientific standpoint.","Chiquete, E.; Toapanta-Yanchapaxi, L.; Cantu-Brito, C.",2020-05-01,Neurology,10.1101/2020.04.26.20079988,1,Erwin Chiquete,Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.20079988v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.20079988v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.34141/LJCS6241818
2163,Analysis on the Clinical Characteristics of 36 Cases of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia in Kunming,"ObjectiveTo analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming City, and to study the correlation between nutritional status and immune function.

MethodsClinical data of 36 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia in isolation area of Kunming Third Peoples Hospital from January 31 to February 15, 2020 were collected, and the basic situation, clinical characteristics, laboratory examination and CT imaging characteristics were analyzed. Serum albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PAB), hypersensitive c-reactive protein (hs-crp), CD3T cells, CD4T cells, CD8T cells and normal control group were analyzed. A simple linear regression analysis of the relationship between proalbumin and T cell subpopulation counts in the blood of patients.

Results(1) The patients with new coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming were mainly of common type. (2) 50% of the patients first symptoms were fever and cough; (3) The total number of white blood cells in peripheral blood was normal or decreased in 23 cases (79%), and the lymphocyte count decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), without anemia. Hypersensitive c-reactive protein increased in 19 (52.78%) cases, and procalcitonin increased in 1 case. Albumin decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), proalbumin decreased in 15 cases (41.67%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), total bilirubin increased slightly in 11 cases (30.56%), and renal function and blood coagulation were normal. Absolute value of CD3+T cells is with a decrease in 21 cases (58.3%), CD4+T in 28 cases (77.8%), CD8+T in 17 cases (47.2%), and CD4+/ CD8+ inverse in 6 cases (16.7%). (4) The prealbumin, CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells in the new coronavirus pneumonia group were significantly lower than those in the normal control group, and the hypersensitive c-reactive protein was higher than that in the normal control group. (5) The levels of PAB in the serum of the patients were linearly correlated with hs-crp, CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells, and the correlation coefficients were -0.474, 0.558, 0.467 and 0.613, respectively, showing statistical differences.

ConclusionThe clinical characteristics of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming are different from those in Wuhan. The changes of serum proalbumin and T cell subsets are relatively obvious. Changes in serum proalbumin may contribute to the early warning of novel coronavirus pneumonia. The nutritional status of patients with common and mild pneumonia should be considered.","Fu, H.; Li, H.; Tang, X.; Li, X.; Shen, J.; Zhou, Y.; Xu, B.; Luo, Y.",2020-03-01,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.02.28.20029173,1,Yu Luo,Kunming Third People\'s Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20029173v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20029173v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
20026,Optimizing testing for COVID-19 in India,"COVID-19 testing across India uses a mix of two types of tests. Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs) are relatively inexpensive point-of-care lateral-flow-assay tests, but they are also less sensitive. The reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test has close to 100% sensitivity and specificity in a laboratory setting, but delays in returning results, as well as increased costs relative to RATs, may vitiate this advantage.

India-wide, about 49% of COVID-19 tests are RATs, but some Indian states, including the large states of Uttar Pradesh (pop. 227.9 million) and Bihar (pop. 121.3 million) use a much higher proportion of such tests. Here we show, using simulations based on epidemiological network models, that the judicious use of RATs can yield epidemiological outcomes comparable to those obtained through RT-PCR-based testing and isolation of positives, provided a few conditions are met. These are (a) that RAT test sensitivity is not too low, (b) that a reasonably large fraction of the population, of order 0.5% per day, can be tested, (c) that those testing positive are isolated for a sufficient duration, and that (d) testing is accompanied by other non-pharmaceutical interventions for increased effectiveness. We assess optimal testing regimes, taking into account test sensitivity and specificity, background seroprevalence and current test pricing. We find, surprisingly, that even 100% RAT test regimes should be acceptable, from both an epidemiological as well as a economic standpoint, provided the conditions outlined above are met.

Author summaryUsing network models, we study optimal ways of combining low sensitivity, relatively inexpensive point-of-care rapid antigen tests for COVID-19 with higher sensitivity but more expensive laboratory RT-PCR tests. We take into account background seroprevalence and current test pricing for such tests in India, finding that even purely rapid antigen test-based regimes can produce the same reduction in overall infections that pure RT-PCR tests are capable of. This is provided one can test at scale and isolate those testing positive effectively, that the sensitivity of the rapid test is not too low and that non-pharmaceutical interventions proceed in parallel for increased effectiveness.","Cherian, P.; Krishna, S.; Menon, G.

13353,A novel approach for evaluating contact patterns and risk mitigation strategies for COVID-19 in English Primary Schools with application of Structured Expert Judgement,"BackgroundContact patterns are the drivers of close-contacts infections, such as COVID-19. In an effort to control COVID-19 transmission in the UK, schools were closed on 23 March 2020. With social distancing in place, Primary Schools were partially re-opened on 1 June 2020, with plans to fully re-open in September 2020. The impact of social distancing and risk mitigation measures on childrens contact patterns is not known.

MethodsWe conducted a structured expert elicitation of a sample of Primary Headteachers to quantify contact patterns within schools in pre-COVID-19 times and how these patterns were expected to change upon re-opening. Point estimates with uncertainty were determined by a formal performance-based algorithm. Additionally, we surveyed school Headteachers about risk mitigation strategies and their anticipated effectiveness.

ResultsExpert elicitation provides estimates of contact patterns that are consistent with contact surveys. We report mean number of contacts per day for four cohorts within schools along with a range at 90% confidence for the variations of contacts among individuals. Prior to lockdown, we estimate that, mean numbers per day, younger children (Reception and Year 1) made 15 contacts [range 8..35] within school, older children (Year 6) 18 contacts [range 5.. 55], teaching staff 25 contacts [range 4.. 55) and non-classroom staff 11 contacts [range 2.. 27]. Compared to pre-COVID times, after schools re-opened the mean number of contacts were reduced by about 53% for young children, about 62% for older children, about 60% for classroom staff and about 64% for other staff. Contacts between teaching and non-teaching staff reduced by 80%, which is consistent with other independent estimates. The distributions of contacts per person are asymmetric indicating a heavy tail of individuals with high contact numbers.

ConclusionsWe interpret the reduction in childrens contacts as a consequence of efforts to reduce mixing with interventions such as forming groups of children (bubbles) who are organized to learn together to limit contacts. Distributions of contacts for children and adults can be used to inform COVID-19 transmission modelling. Our findings suggest that while official DfE guidelines form the basis for risk mitigation in schools, individual schools have adopted their own bespoke strategies, often going beyond the guidelines.","Sparks, S.

To address this, single-cell RNA sequencing data-sets were integrated from human minor salivary glands and gingiva to identify 11 epithelial, 7 mesenchymal, and 15 immune cell clusters. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry factor expression showed enrichment in epithelia including the ducts and acini of the salivary glands and the suprabasal cells of the mucosae. COVID-19 autopsy tissues confirmed in vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection in the salivary glands and mucosa. Saliva from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals harbored epithelial cells exhibiting ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Matched nasopharyngeal and saliva samples found distinct viral shedding dynamics and viral burden in saliva correlated with COVID-19 symptoms including taste loss. Upon recovery, this cohort exhibited salivary antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Collectively, the oral cavity represents a robust site for COVID-19 infection and implicates saliva in viral transmission.","Byrd, K.

15055,"Proteomics identifies a type I IFN, prothrombotic hyperinflammatory circulating COVID-19 neutrophil signature distinct from non-COVID-19 ARDS","Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe critical condition with a high mortality that is currently in focus given that it is associated with mortality caused by coronavirus induced disease 2019 (COVID-19). Neutrophils play a key role in the lung injury characteristic of non-COVID-19 ARDS and there is also accumulating evidence of neutrophil mediated lung injury in patients who succumb to infection with SARS-CoV-2. We undertook a functional proteomic and metabolomic survey of circulating neutrophil populations, comparing patients with COVID-19 ARDS and non-COVID-19 ARDS to understand the molecular basis of neutrophil dysregulation. Expansion of the circulating neutrophil compartment and the presence of activated low and normal density mature and immature neutrophil populations occurs in ARDS, irrespective of cause. Release of neutrophil granule proteins, neutrophil activation of the clotting cascade and upregulation of the Mac-1 platelet binding complex with formation of neutrophil platelet aggregates is exaggerated in COVID-19 ARDS. Importantly, activation of components of the neutrophil type I interferon responses is seen in ARDS following infection with SARS-CoV-2, with associated rewiring of neutrophil metabolism, and the upregulation of antigen processing and presentation. Whilst dexamethasone treatment constricts the immature low density neutrophil population it does not impact upon prothrombotic hyperinflammatory neutrophil signatures.

SummaryGiven the crucial role of neutrophils in ARDS and the evidence of a disordered myeloid response observed in COVID-19 patients, our work maps the molecular basis for neutrophil reprogramming in the distinct clinical entities of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS.

But there is concern that unsupervised specimen collection may produce inferior samples. Across two studies that included unsupervised at-home mid-turbinate specimen collection, [~]1% of participants used the wrong end of the swab. We found that molecular detection of respiratory pathogens and a human biomarker were comparable between specimens collected from the handle of the swab and those collected correctly.

8661,SARS-CoV-2 genetic variations associated with COVID-19 severity,"Herein, we performed a genome-wide association study on SARS-CoV-2 genomes to identify genetic variations that might be associated with the COVID-19 severity. 152 full-length genomes of SARS-CoV-2 that were generated from original clinical samples and whose patient status could be determined conclusively as either ""asymptomatic"" or ""symptomatic"" were retrieved from the GISAID database. We found that nucleotide variations at the genomic position 11,083, locating in the coding region of non-structural protein 6, were associated with the COVID-19 severity. While the 11083G variant (i.e. having G at the position 11,083) was more commonly found in symptomatic patients, the 11083T variant appeared to associate more often with asymptomatic infections. We also identified three microRNAs that differentially target the two variants, namely miR-485-3p, miR-539-3p, and miR-3149. This may in part contribute to the differential association of the two SARS-CoV-2 variants with the disease severity.","Aiewsakun, P.; Wongtrakoongate, P.; Thawornwattana, Y.; Hongeng, S.; Thitithanyanont, A.",2020-06-02,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.27.20114546,1,Pakorn Aiewsakun,"Faculty of Science, Mahidol University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.20114546v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.20114546v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
13733,"Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), a novel biomarker to predict the severity of COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis","BackgroundPlatelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), a novel inflammatory marker, has been suggested to be able to predict the severity of COVID-19 patients. This systematic review aims to evaluate the association between PLR levels on admission and the severity of COVID-19 patients.

MethodsA systematic literature search was done on 23 July 2020 to identify peer-reviewed studies across four different databases (Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Library), preprints from two databases (MedRxiv and SSRN), and grey literature from two databases (WHO COVID-19 Global Research Database and Center for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article). Research articles comparing the PLR value on admission in adult patients with COVID-19 with varying degrees of severity were included in the analysis. The following keywords were used for the search: ""COVID-19"", ""PLR"", ""severity"", and ""mortality"". The inverse variance method was used to calculate the pooled effect standardized mean difference (SMD) along with its 95% confidence interval (CI).

ResultsA total of seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, six of which were conducted in China. From a total of 998 participants included, 316 (31.7%) had severe diseases; and those in the severe group were generally older and had underlying diseases compared to the non-severe group. In comparison to non-severe patients, the meta-analysis showed that severe COVID-19 patients had higher PLR levels on admission (SMD 0.68; 95%CI 0.43-0.93; I2 =58%).

ConclusionHigh PLR levels on admission were associated with severe COVID-19 cases. Therefore, on-admission PLR level is a novel, cost-effective, and readily available biomarker with a promising prognostic role for determining the severity of COVID-19 patients.","Simadibrata, D.

19952,"Respiratory and non-respiratory manifestations in children admitted with COVID 19 in Rio de Janeiro city, Brazil","IntroductionCOVID 19 is still a challenge in pediatrics due to variety of symptoms and different presentations

AimTo describe clinical, laboratorial and treatment of confirmed COVID-19 pediatric admitted in hospitals.

MethodsA retrospective study was conducted in children (0-18 years), admitted between March and November 15, 2020, with confirmed COVID-19 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or serological tests. Clinical data about symptoms, laboratorial exams and treatments were analysed. Patients were evaluated according predominant (PRS) or non-predominant respiratory symptoms (non-PRS)

ResultsSixty-four patients were evaluated, being the median age 5.6 years. Forty-seven (73.4%) children were admitted with PRS and 17 (26.4%) with non-PRS. The main symptoms in the PRS group were fever in 74.5% of children and cough in 66%; and fever in 76.5% and edema/cavitary effusion in 29.4% in the non-PRS group. The median of C-reactive protein (in mg/dl) was 2.5 in the PRS group and 6.1 in the non-PRS group. Antibiotics were used in 85.1% of the PRS group and 94.1% of non-group. Comorbidity was present in 30/47 (63.8%) of PRS group and 8/17 (47.1%) of non-PRS group (p=0.22). Length of stay until 7 days in patients with comorbidity was present in 27/64 (42.1%) and more than 7 days in 11/64 (17.1%) (p= 0.2)

ConclusionNon-PRS represented more than one quarter of admitted patients. Fever was the main symptom detected, elevated CRP was frequent and antibiotics were commonly prescribed. Comorbidity was found in both groups and his presence was not associated with a longer length of stay.","Araujo Da Silva, A. R. A.; Foinseca, C. G. B.; De Miranda, J. L. P. S.; Travassos, B.

In six cases, in four of the affected countries (Switzerland, France, Austria, Croatia), land travel was a likely route of introduction, or was documented to have been the route of introduction2.","Tuite, A.; Ng, V.; Rees, E.; Fisman, D.",2020-03-06,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.02.20030049,1,David Fisman,University of Toronto,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.20030049v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.20030049v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
18928,Fatigue outcomes following coronavirus or influenza virus infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"ObjectivesFatigue is a pervasive clinical symptom for many infected with respiratory viruses such as influenza or coronaviruses. Prior evidence from influenza and coronavirus epidemics suggest that fatigue symptomology may continue beyond the acute phase, lasting for several months to several years post-discharge. This systematic review aimed to examine long-term fatigue prevalence among survivors and among communities, as well as investigate the current evidence for associated factors.

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

SettingHospitalised and community samples.

ParticipantsPatient populations with a confirmed diagnosis of a named influenza virus or coronavirus.

Main outcomes measuredFatigue, fatigue syndromes

ResultsTen studies met the inclusion criteria for a pooled prevalence analysis and five studies were identified as eligible for a means differences analysis. A fatigue prevalence of 41% (95% CI 0.299-0.488) was found among a total population of 1,310. Using the  vitality subscale of the SF-36 as a proxy for fatigue, the estimate for means differences indicated a lower mean vitality score for survivors compared to population norms (M -1.523, CI -13.53 - 10.48), although this was not significant (p = 0.803). The most common associations with fatigue were PTSD, depression and anxiety, female gender and higher age.

ConclusionsThis study reveals that a significant proportion of survivors (41%) experienced fatigue following their recovery from novel respiratory viruses such as SARS, MERS, SARS-CoV2 or influenza and that this fatigue can be long-lasting. Also, some factors such as female gender and psychological factors may contribute to continuing fatigue outcomes for this population.

Strengths and limitations(a) this study provides support for long-term fatigue outcomes in people with a confirmed influenza, SARS, MERS, SARS-CoV2 virus infection (b) the study suggests individual, psychological and social factors are associated with fatigue, (c) findings are limited by the availability of fatigue data and lack of pre-morbid fatigue information; (d) a meta-analysis on the associations was prohibited by the small number of studies investigating long-term fatigue correlates and (e) the heterogeneity of the studies (>75%) suggests the pooled estimates should be interpreted with caution.","Poole-Wright, K.

7354,Development of a Predictive Score for COVID-19 Diagnosis based on Demographics and Symptoms in Patients Attended at a Dedicated Screening Unit,"BackgroundThe diagnosis of COVID-19 based on clinical evaluation is difficult because symptoms often overlap with other respiratory diseases. A clinical score predictive of COVID-19 based on readily assessed variables may be useful in settings with restricted or no access to molecular diagnostic tests.

MethodsA score based on demographics and symptoms was developed in a cross-sectional study including patients attended in a dedicated COVID-19 screening unit. A backward stepwise logistic regression model was constructed and values for each variable were assigned according to their {beta} coefficient values in the final model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed and its area under the curve (AUC) was calculated.

ResultsA total of 464 patients were included: 98 (21.1%) COVID-19 and 366 (78.9%) non-COVID-19 patients. The score included variables independently associated with COVID-19 in the final model: age [&ge;]60 years (2 points), fever (2), dyspnea (1), fatigue (1 point) and coryza (-1). Score values were significantly higher in COVID-19 than non-COVID-19 patients: median (Interquartile Range), 3 (2-4), and 1 (0-2), respectively; P<0.001. The score had an AUC of 0.80 (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.76-0.86). The specificity of scores [&ge;]4 and [&ge;]5 points were 90.4 (95%CI, 87.0-93.3) and 96.2 (95%CI, 93.7-97.9), respectively.

ConclusionsThis preliminary score based on patients symptoms is a feasible tool that may be useful in setting with restricted or no access to molecular tests in a pandemic period, owing to the high specificity. Further studies are required to validate the score in other populations.","Zavascki, A. P.; Gazzana, M. B.; Bidart, J. P.; Fernandes, P. S.; Galiotto, A.; Kawski, C. T.; Nasi, L. A.; Falci, D.

16704,Use of dried blood spot samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection using the Roche Elecsys high throughput immunoassay,"BackgroundDried blood spot samples (DBS) provide an alternative sample type to venous blood samples for antibody testing. DBS are used by NHS for diagnosing HCV and by PHE for large scale HIV and Hepatitis C serosurveillance; the applicability of DBS based approaches to SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection is uncertain.

ObjectiveTo compare antibody detection in dried blood spot eluates using the Roche Elecsys (R) immunoassay (index test) with antibody detection in paired plasma samples, using the same assay (reference test).

SettingOne Police and one Fire & Rescue facility in England.

Participants195 participants within a larger sample COVID-19 serodiagnostics study of keyworkers, EDSAB-HOME.

Outcome MeasuresSensitivity and specificity of DBS (the index test) relative to plasma (the reference test), at an experimental cut-off; quality of DBS sample collected; estimates of relative sensitivity of DBS vs. plasma immunoassay in a larger population.

Results18/195 (9.2%) participants tested positive using plasma samples. DBS sample quality varied markedly by phlebotomist, and low sample volume significantly reduced immunoassay signals. Using a cut-off of ten median absolute deviations above the immunoassay result with negative samples, sensitivity and specificity of DBS were 89.0% (95% CI 67.2, 96.9%) and 100.0% (95% CI 97.9, 100%) respectively compared with using plasma. The limit of detection for DBS is about 30 times higher than for plasma.

ConclusionDBS use for SARS-CoV-2 serology, though feasible, is insensitive relative to immunoassays on plasma. Sample quality impacts on assay performance. Alternatives, including the collection of capillary blood samples, should be considered for screening programs.","Mulchandani, R.; Brown, B.; Brooks, T.; Semper, A.; Machin, N.; Linley, E.; Borrow, R.; Study Investigators, E.-H.; Wyllie, D.",2020-10-21,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.19.20215228,1,David Wyllie,Public Health England,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.20215228v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.20215228v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.jcv.2021.104739
9418,Kinetics of the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2: comparative analytical performance of seven commercial serology tests,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 serology tests are clinically useful to document a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with no or inconclusive PCR results and suspected COVID-19 disease or sequelae. Data are urgently needed to select the assays with optimal sensitivity at acceptable specificity.

MethodsA comparative analysis of analytical sensitivity was performed of seven commercial SARS-CoV-2 serology assays on 171 sera from 135 subjects with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, composed of 71 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia and 64 healthcare workers with paucisymptomatic infections. The kinetics of IgA/IgM/IgG seroconversion to viral N-and S-protein epitopes were studied from 0 to 54 days after symptom onset. Specificity was verified on 57 pre-pandemic samples.

ResultsWantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA and Orient Gene COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test achieved a superior overall sensitivity. Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay and EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 combined IgG/IgA also showed acceptable sensitivity (>95%) versus the consensus result of all assays from 10 days post symptom onset. Optimal specificity (>98%) was achieved only by Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay and Innovita 2019-nCoV Ab rapid test. LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG showed a significantly lower sensitivity as compared to all other assays. Lack of seroconversion by any test was seen in 1.4% of hospitalized and 4.7% of paucisymptomatic infections. Within 10 days from symptom onset, only the Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA has acceptable sensitivity.

ConclusionsWantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays are suitable for sensitive and specific screening of a SARS-CoV-2 infection from 10 days after symptom onset.

Brief summaryThere is an urgent need for SARS-CoV-2 serology tests for the sensitive and specific detection of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection as a complementary diagnostic tool to molecular testing. Various commercial assays are becoming available but comparison of their relative performance is difficult unless they are head-to-head evaluated. Here we compared seven commercial assays on sera equally composed of mild and severe PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our analysis indicates a superior performance of the Wantai SARS-COV-2 ELISA for total antibodies to the S-RBD domain. Also, the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay for total antibodies to the N-protein shows good performance for high-throughput screening.","Herroelen, P. H.; Martens, G.

17400,Emergence of Novel SARS-CoV-2 Variants in the Netherlands,"In this study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the Netherlands, in the context of global viral population since the beginning of the pandemic. We have identified the most variant sites on the whole genome as well as the stable, conserved ones on the S and N proteins. We found four mutations, S:D614G, NSP12b:P314L, NSP3:F106F, to be the most frequent ones that dominate the SARS-CoV-2 population outside of China. We detected novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 almost unique to the Netherlands that form localized clusters, indicating community spread. We emphasize that while SARS-CoV-2 is evolving, and the number of mutations from the reference sequence is increasing, we observe only little diversity in the new variants as we enter the later stages of the pandemic. Our analyses suggest we have diverged away from the current SARS-CoV-2 reference enough that the reference should be re-evaluated to represent the current viral population more accurately. We assert our work provides valuable information on the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 and its local dynamics in the Netherlands, especially for DNA-based diagnostic, therapeutic or vaccine development against COVID-19. We suggest sequence-based analyses should opt for a consensus representation to adequately cover the genomic variation observed.","Urhan, A.; Abeel, T.",2020-11-04,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.11.02.20224352,1,Thomas Abeel,Delft University of Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.02.20224352v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.02.20224352v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
9097,Risk and protective factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection - Meta-regression of data from worldwide nations,"Although it has been reported that coexistent chronic diseases are strongly associated with COVID-19 severity, investigations of predictors for SARS-CoV-2 infection itself have been seldom performed. To screen potential risk and protective factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection, meta-regression of data from worldwide nations were herein conducted. We extracted total confirmed COVID-19 cases in worldwide 180 nations (May 31, 2020), nation total population, population ages 0-14/[&ge;]65, GDP/GNI per capita, PPP, life expectancy at birth, medical-doctor and nursing/midwifery-personnel density, hypertension/obesity/diabetes prevalence, annual PM2.5 concentrations, daily ultraviolet radiation, population using safely-managed drinking-water/sanitation services and hand-washing facility with soap/water, inbound tourism, and bachelors or equivalent (ISCED 6). Restricted maximum-likelihood meta-regression in the random-effects model was performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3. To adjust for other covariates, we conducted the hierarchical multivariate models. A slope (coefficient) of the meta-regression line for the COVID-19 prevalence was significantly negative for population ages 0-14 (-0.0636; P = .0021) and positive for obesity prevalence (0.0411; P = .0099) and annual PM2.5 concentrations in urban areas (0.0158; P = .0454), which would indicate that the COVID-19 prevalence decreases significantly as children increase and that the COVID-19 prevalence increases significantly as the obese and PM2.5 increase. In conclusion, children (negatively) and obesity/PM2.5 (positively) may be independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Takagi, H.; Kuno, T.; Yokoyama, Y.; Ueyama, H.; Matsushiro, T.; Hari, Y.; Ando, T.",2020-06-07,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.06.20124016,1,Hisato Takagi,Shizuoka Medical Center,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.06.20124016v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.06.20124016v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
9892,Time Course of COVID-19 epidemic in Algeria: Retrospective estimate of the actual burden,"Since December 2019, the five continents have been incrementally invaded by SARS-CoV-2. Africa is the last and least affected to date. However, Algeria is among the first countries affected since February 25, 2020. In order to benefit from its experience in the least affected countries, this study aims to describe the epidemics current situation and then retrospectively estimate its real burden.

As a first part of the study, we described the epidemics indicators as; the cumulative and daily reported cases and deaths, and we computed the R0 evolution. Secondly, we used the New York City cases-fatality rate standardized by Algerian age structure, to retrospectively estimate the actual burden.

We found that reported cases are in a clear diminution, but, the epidemic epicentre is moving from Blida to other cities. We noted a clear peak in daily cases-fatality from March 30, to April 17, 2020, Fig. 3, due to underestimating the actual infections of the first 25 days. Since May 8, 2020, the daily R0 is around one, Fig. 4. Moreover, we noticed 31% reduction of its mean value from 1,41 to 0,97 between the last two months. The Algerian Age-Standardized Infection Fatality Rate we found is 0,88%. Based on that, we demonstrated that only 1,5% of actual infections were detected and reported before March 30, and 20% after March 31, Fig. 5. Therefore, the actual infections burden is currently five times higher than reported. At the end, we found that at least 0,2 % of the population have been infected until May 27. Consequently, the acquired herd immunity to date is therefore not sufficient to avoid a second wave.

6864,Saliva as a non-invasive sample for the detection of SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review,"The accepted gold standard for diagnosing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS). However, shortage of reagents has made NPS collection challenging, and alternative samples need to be explored. Due to its non-invasive nature, saliva has considerable diagnostic potential. Therefore, to guide diagnostic laboratories globally, we conducted a systematic review to determine the utility of saliva for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. A systematic search of major databases (PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar) was performed to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. There was a total of 10 publications that fit the criteria for review. Most studies collected drooled whole saliva from hospitalized patients or pipetted saliva from intubated patients. Saliva was positive in 31-92% of patients depending on the cohort and length of hospitalization. Viral loads in saliva are comparable to those in NPS and ranged from 9.9 x 102 to 1.2 x 108 copies/mL during the first week of symptoms and decrease over time. Saliva can be positive up to 20 days post-symptom onset with viral loads correlating with symptom severity and degree of tissue damage. Based on these findings, we made suggestions to guide the clinical laboratory and suggest the need for diagnostic accuracy studies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva.","Khurshid, Z.; Zohaib, S.; Joshi, C.; Moin, S.

14183,Excess cardiovascular deaths in the beginning of COVID-19 outbreak,"ImportanceThe healthcare demand created by the COVID-19 pandemic was far beyond the hospital surge capacity in many countries, resulting in possible negative influence on prognosis of other severe diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD).

ObjectiveTo assess the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on CVD-related hospitalizations and mortality.

DesignCommunity-based prospective cohort study.

Setting the UK Biobank population.

Participants421,717 UK Biobank participants who were registered in England and alive on December 1st 2019.

Main outcomes and measuresThe primary outcome of interest was CVD death, as deaths with CVD as a cause of death according to the death registers. We retrieved information on hospitalizations with CVD as the primary diagnosis based on the UK Biobank hospital inpatient data. The study period was between December 1st 2019 and May 30th 2020, and we used the same calendar period of the three preceding years as the reference period. Standardized mortality/incidence ratios (SMRs/SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals were used to estimate the relative risk of CVD outcomes during the study period, compared with the reference period, to control for seasonal variations and aging of the study population.

ResultsWe observed a distinct increase in CVD-related deaths in March and April 2020 as compared to the corresponding months of the three preceding years. The observed number of CVD death (n=217) was almost doubled in April, compared with the expected number (n=120), corresponding to an SMR of 1.81 (95% CI 1.58-2.06). We observed a sharp decline of CVD hospitalization in March (n=841) and April (n=454), compared with the expected number (n=1208 for March and 1026 for April), leading to an SIR of 0.70 (95% CI 0.65-0.74) for March and 0.44 (95% CI 0.40-0.48) for April. There was also a clear increase of death, but a clear decrease of hospitalization, in March and April for all the five major subtypes of CVD.

ConclusionsWe observed a distinct excess in CVD deaths in the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK Biobank population. In addition to CVD complications of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the reduced hospital capacity might have contributed to the observed excess CVD deaths.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow did the COVID-19 outbreak affect rates of CVD-related death and hospitalization?

FindingIn this prospective study involving 421,717 UK Biobank participants, we observed excess CVD-related mortality in parallel with decreased CVD-related hospitalization in the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, March and April 2020.

MeaningIn addition to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection progressing to CVD-related death, reduced hospital resources might have partially contributed to the excess CVD mortality.","Wang, J.; Zhu, J.; Yang, H.; Hu, Y.; Sun, Y.; Ying, Z.; Qu, Y.; Valdimarsdottir, U.

In Australia, nationwide restrictions included staying at home, unless seeking medical care, providing care, purchasing food, undertaking exercise, or attending work in an essential service. All undergraduate university classes transitioned to online, mostly home-based learning. This disruption to daily life may have consequences for eating and physical activity patterns.

MethodsIn this observational study, we examined the effect of isolation measures, during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia (March/April), on diet (24-hour diet recall, ASA-24) and physical activity (Active Australia Survey) patterns among third-year biomedical students in Brisbane, Australia. Findings were compared to students enrolled in the same course in the previous two years.

ResultsIn females, energy intake was ~20% greater in 2020 compared with 2018 and 2019, and the frequency of snacking and energy density of consumed snacks were also increased. In males, there was no difference in energy intake or snacking behaviour. Physical activity was impacted for both sexes, whereby fewer students undertook any walking activity and, of those that did, time spent doing so was less compared with 2018 and 2019. The proportion of students reporting any vigorous activity was not different for males or females but, among males who participated in this level of activity, the duration was less in 2020 compared with previous years. The proportion of male and female students achieving  sufficient levels of activity, defined by at least 150 mins over at least 5 sessions, was ~30% less in 2020. Indeed, the majority of students reported as having undertaken less physical activity than usual.

ConclusionsIncreased energy intake for females and reduced physical activity for males and females demonstrate impacts of isolation measures that may have deleterious consequences for physical and mental wellbeing, with the potential to affect long-term nutrition and activity patterns.","Gallo, L.

10778,Exploring Epidemiological Behavior of Novel Coronavirus Outbreak through the Development and Analysis of COVID-19 Daily Dataset in Bangladesh,"BackgroundGlobally, there is an obvious concern about the fact that the evolving 2019-nCoV coronavirus is a worldwide public health threat. The appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China at the end of 2019 triggered a major global epidemic, which is now a major community health issue. As of April 17, 2020, according to Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh has reported 1838 confirmed cases in between 8 March to 17 April 2020, with > 4.08% of mortality rate and >3.15% of recovery rate. COVID-19 outbreak is evolving so rapidly in Bangladesh; therefore, the availability of epidemiological data and its sensible analysis are essential to direct strategies for situational awareness and intervention.

MethodThis article presents an exploratory data analysis approach to collect and analyze COVID-19 data on epidemiological outbreaks based on first publicly available COVID-19 Daily Dataset of Bangladesh. Various publicly open data sources on the outbreak of COVID-19 provided by the IEDCR, World Health Organization (WHO), Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MHFW) of Bangladesh have been used in this research.

ResultsA Visual Exploratory Data Analysis (V-EDA) techniques have been followed in this research to understand the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 outbreak in different districts of Bangladesh in between 8 March 2020 to 12 April 2020 and these findings were compared with those of other countries.

ConclusionsIn all, this is extremely important to promptly spread information to understand the risks of this pandemic and begin containment activities in the country.","Dey, S. K.; Rahman, M.

2893,Modeling Covid-19 dynamics for real-time estimates and projections: anapplication to Albanian data,"The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is one of the biggest challenges healthcare systems worldwide have ever had to face. To curb transmission many countries have adopted social distancing measures and travel restrictions. Estimating the effect of these measures in each context is challenging and requires mathematical models of the transmission dynamics. Projections for the future course of the epidemic strongly rely on model predictions and accurate representation of real-time data as they accumulate. Here I develop an SEIR modeling framework for Covid-19, to evaluate reported cases and fatalities, and to enable forecasting using evidence-based Bayesian parameter estimation. This Bayesian framework offers a tool to parametrize real-time dynamics of Covid-19 cases, and explore the effect of control as it unfolds in any setting. I apply the model to Covid-19 data from Albania, where drastic control measures were put in place already on the day of the first confirmed case. Evaluating the dynamics of reported cases 9-31 March 2020, I estimate parameters and make preliminary projections. Three weeks into the measures, Albanian data already indicate a strong signature of more than 40% transmission reduction, and lend support to a progressively increasing effect of control measures rather than a static one. In the Albanian setting, the model and data match well, projecting the peak of the outbreak may be around 5-15 April, and be contained within 300 active confirmed cases if control continues with the same trend. This framework can be used to understand the quantitative effects of different control measures in real-time, and inform adaptive intervention for success in other settings.","Gjini, E.",2020-04-07,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.20.20038141,2,Erida Gjini,Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.20.20038141v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.20.20038141v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
9950,A Counterfactual Graphical Model Reveals Economic and Sociodemographic Variables as Key Determinants of Country-Wise COVID-19 Burden,"ImportanceInsights into the country-wise differences in COVID-19 burden can impact the policies being developed to control disease spread.

ObjectivePresent study evaluated the possible socio-economic and health related factors (and their temporal consistency) determining the disease burden of COVID-19.

DesignA retrospective analysis for identifying associations of COVID-19 burden.

SettingData on COVID-19 statistics (number of cases, tests and deaths per million) was extracted from the website https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ on 10th April and 12th May. Variables obtained to estimate the possible determinants for COVID-19 burden included economic-gross domestic product; socio-demographic-Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs indicators related to health systems, percentage Chinese diaspora; and COVID-19 trajectory-date of first case in each country, days between first reported case and 10th April, days between 100th and 1000th case, and government response stringency index (GRSI).

Main outcomes and MeasuresCOVID-19 burden was modeled using economic and socio-demographic determinants. Consistency of inferences for two time points at three levels of increasing statistical rigor using (i) Spearman correlations, (ii) Bayesian probabilistic graphical model, and (iii) counterfactual impact was evaluated.

ResultsCountries economy (reflected by GDP), mainly through the testing rates, was the major and temporally consistent determinant of COVID-19 burden in the model. Reproduction number of COVID-19 was lower where mortality due to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) was higher, thus strengthening the hygiene hypothesis. There was no association between vaccination status or tuberculosis incidence and COVID burden, refuting the claims over BCG vaccination as a possible factor against COVID-19 trajectory.

Conclusion and RelevanceCountries economy, through testing power, was the major determinant of COVID-19 burden. There was weak evidence for hygiene hypothesis as a protective factor against COVID-19.","Sethi, T.; Kedia, S.; Awasthi, R.; Lodha, R.; Ahuja, V.",2020-06-19,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.06.16.20132563,1,Vineet Ahuja,All India Institute of Medical Sciences,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.20132563v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.20132563v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

MethodsWe conducted a study on 46 symptomatic subjects with disease confirmed by laboratory tests, to evaluate the presence of IgG and IgM antibodies in these subjects in relation to the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms. The analytical performance of the method used in the study and the effect of two different serum and plasma matrices were also assessed.

ResultsIgG positivity was demonstrated in 100% of cases 15 days after the onset of the disease. IgM show lower concentrations and do not exceed 77% of cases after 15 days. The analytical performance of the method used (Maglumi 800, Snibe, China) was confirmed to be good in terms of imprecision, linearity and commutability in two sample matrix.

13365,Comparison of COVID-19 Infections Among Healthcare Workers and Non-Healthcare Workers,"ObjectivesHealthcare workers face distinct occupational challenges that affect their personal health, especially during a pandemic. In this study we compare the characteristics and outcomes of Covid-19 patients who are and who are not healthcare workers (HCW).

MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed a cohort of adult patients with known HCW status and a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test presenting to a large academic medical center emergency department (ED) in New York State. We routinely collect data on occupation and exposures to suspected Covid-19. The primary outcome was hospital admission. Secondary outcomes were ICU admission, need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality. We compared baseline characteristics and outcomes of Covid-19 adult patients based on whether they were or were not HCW using univariable and multivariable analyses.

ResultsFrom March 1 2020 through June 2020, 2,842 adult patients (mean age 53+/-19 years, 53% male) with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests and known HCW status visited the ED. This included 193 (6.8%) known HCWs and 2,649 (93.2%) non-HCWs. Compared with non-HCW, HCWs were younger (43 vs 53 years, P<0.001), more likely female (118/193 vs 1211/2649, P<0.001), and more likely to have a known Covid-19 exposure (161/193 vs 946/2649, P<0.001), but had fewer comorbidities. On presentation to the ED, HCW also had lower frequencies of tachypnea (12/193 vs 426/2649, P<0.01), hypoxemia (15/193 vs 564/2649, P<0.01), bilateral opacities on imaging (38/193 vs 1189/2649, P<0.001), and lymphocytopenia (6/193 vs 532/2649, P<0.01) compared to non-HCWs. Direct discharges home from the ED were more frequent in HCW 154/193: 80% vs 1275/2649: 48% p<0.001). Hospital admissions (38/193 20% vs 1264/2694 47%, P<0.001), ICU admissions (7/193 3% vs 321/2694 12%, P<0.001), need for IMV (6/193 3% vs 321/2694 12%, P<0.001) and mortality (2/193 1% vs 219/2694 8%, P<0.01) were lower than among non-HCW. After controlling for age, sex, comorbidities, presenting vital signs and radiographic imaging, HCW were less likely to be admitted (OR 0.6, 95%CI 0.3-0.9) than non HCW.

ConclusionsCompared with non HCW, HCW with Covid-19 were younger, had less severe illness, and were less likely to be admitted.","Kim, R.; Nachman, S.; Fernandes, R.; Meyers, K.; Taylor, M.; Leblanc, D.; Singer, A.",2020-08-15,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.13.20174482,1,Rachel Kim,Stony Brook University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20174482v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20174482v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1371/journal.pone.0241956
8453,Social Distancing Interventions in the United States: An Exploratory Investigation of Determinants and Impacts,"BackgroundTo combat the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States, many states and Washington DC enacted Stay-at-Home order and nonpharmaceutical mitigation interventions. This study examined the determinants of the timing to implement an intervention. Through an impact analysis, the study explored the effects of the interventions and the potential risks of removing them under the context of reopening the economy.

MethodA content analysis identified nine types of mitigation interventions and the timing at which states enacted these strategies. A proportional hazard model, a multiple-event survival model, and a random-effect spatial error panel model in conjunction with a robust method analyzing zero-inflated and skewed outcomes were employed in the data analysis.

FindingsTo our knowledge, we provided in this article the first explicit analysis of the timing, determinants, and impacts of mitigation interventions for all states and Washington DC in the United States during the first five weeks of the pandemic. Unlike other studies that evaluate the Stay-at-Home order by using simulated data, the current study employed the real data of various case counts of Covid-19. The study obtained two meritorious findings: (1) states with a higher prevalence of Covid-19 cases per 10,000 population reacted more slowly to the outbreak, suggesting that some states may have missed the optimal timing to prevent the wide spread of the Covid-19 disease; and (2) of nine mitigation measures, three (non-essential business closure, large-gathering bans, and restaurant/bar limitations) showed positive impacts on reducing cumulative cases, new cases, and death rates across states.

InterpretationThe opposite direction of the prevalence rate on the timing of issuing the mitigation interventions partially explains why the Covid-19 caseload in the U.S. remains high. A swift implementation of social distancing is crucial-- the key is not whether such measures should be taken but when. Because there is no preventive vaccine and because there are few potentially effective treatments, recent reductions in new cases and deaths must be due, in large part, to the social interventions delivered by states. The study suggests that the policy of reopening economy needs to be implemented carefully.","Guo, S.; An, R.; Mcbride, T.

Here we applied Richards function to simulate and forecast the course of COVID-19 epidemics in Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Turkey, Belgium, Ireland, Netherlands, Portugal and Switzerland. Potential total COVID-19 confirmed cases in these countries were estimated to be 240400{+/-}1300, 294100{+/-}4000, 178500{+/-}800, 176900{+/-}700, 155400{+/-}1000, 57900{+/-}400, 24000{+/-}200, 46200{+/-}300, 30000{+/-}300 and 30700{+/-}100 respectively.

2067,Genomic variations of SARS-CoV-2 suggest multiple outbreak sources of transmission,"We examined 169 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and found that they can be classified into two major genotypes, Type I and Type II. Type I can be further divided into Type IA and IB. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that the Type IA resembles the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 most. Type II was likely evolved from Type I and predominant in the infections. Our results suggest that Type II SARS-CoV-2 was the source of the outbreak in the Wuhan Huanan market and it was likely originated from a super-spreader. The outbreak caused by the Type I virus should have occurred somewhere else, because the patients had no direct link to the market. Furthermore, by analyzing three genomic sites that distinguish Type I and Type II strains, we found that synonymous changes at two of the three sites confer higher protein translational efficiencies in Type II strains than in Type I strains, which might explain why Type II strains are predominant, implying that Type II is more contagious (transmissible) than Type I. These findings could be valuable for the current epidemic prevention and control.","Zhang, L.; Yang, J.-R.; Zhang, Z.; Lin, Z.",2020-03-05,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.02.25.20027953,2,Liangsheng Zhang,FAfu,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027953v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027953v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
15984,Diagnostic performance of the combined nasal and throat swab in patients admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19,"BackgroundAccurate diagnosis in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is essential to guide treatment and limit spread of the virus. The combined nasal and throat swab is used widely, but its diagnostic performance is uncertain.

MethodsIn a prospective, multi-centre, cohort study conducted in secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Scotland, we evaluated the combined nasal and throat swab with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in consecutive patients admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19. Diagnostic performance of the index and serial tests was evaluated for a primary outcome of confirmed or probable COVID-19, and a secondary outcome of confirmed COVID-19 on serial testing. The diagnosis was adjudicated by a panel, who recorded clinical, laboratory and radiological features blinded to the test results.

ResultsWe enrolled 1,369 consecutive patients (68 [53-80] years, 47% women) who underwent a total of 3,822 tests (median 2 [1-3] tests per patient). The primary outcome occurred in 36% (496/1,369), of whom 65% (323/496) and 35% (173/496) had confirmed and probable COVID-19, respectively. The index test was positive in 255/496 (51%) patients with the primary outcome, giving a sensitivity and specificity of 51.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48.8 to 54.1%) and 99.5% (95% CI 99.0 to 99.8%). Sensitivity increased in those undergoing 2, 3 or 4 tests to 60.1% (95% CI 56.7 to 63.4%), 68.3% (95% CI 64.0 to 72.3%) and 77.6% (95% CI 72.7 to 81.9%), respectively. The sensitivity of the index test was 78.9% (95% CI 74.4 to 83.2%) for the secondary outcome of confirmed COVID-19 on serial testing.

ConclusionsIn patients admitted to hospital, a single combined nasal and throat swab with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 has excellent specificity, but limited diagnostic sensitivity for COVID-19. Diagnostic performance is significantly improved by repeated testing.","Lee, K.

15027,"Adherence to the test, trace and isolate system: results from a time series of 21 nationally representative surveys in the UK (the COVID-19 Rapid Survey of Adherence to Interventions and Responses  study)","Objectives: To investigate rates of adherence to the UKs test, trace and isolate system over time. Design: Time series of cross-sectional online surveys. Setting: Data were collected between 2 March and 5 August 2020. Participants: 42,127 responses from 31,787 people living in the UK, aged 16 years or over, are presented (21 survey waves, n{approx}2,000 per wave). Main outcome measures: Identification of the key symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, high temperature / fever, and loss of sense of smell or taste), self-reported adherence to self-isolation if symptomatic, requesting an antigen test if symptomatic, intention to share details of close contacts, self-reported adherence to quarantine if alerted that you had been in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case. Results: Only 48.9% of participants (95% CI 48.2% to 49.7%) identified key symptoms of COVID-19. Self-reported adherence to test, trace and isolate behaviours was low (self-isolation 18.2%, 95% CI 16.4% to 19.9%; requesting an antigen test 11.9%, 95% CI 10.1% to 13.8%; intention to share details of close contacts 76.1%, 95% CI 75.4% to 76.8%; quarantining 10.9%, 95% CI 7.8% to 13.9%) and largely stable over time. By contrast, intention to adhere to protective measures was much higher. Non-adherence was associated with: men, younger age groups, having a dependent child in the household, lower socio-economic grade, greater hardship during the pandemic, and working in a key sector. Conclusions: Practical support and financial reimbursement is likely to improve adherence.

15473,Epidemiological characterization of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and positivity in subsequent RT-PCR tests in the United Arab Emirates,"BackgroundCOVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases could be symptomatic or asymptomatic. In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the identified COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases are yet to be characterized. In this study, we characterized the first cohort of COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases reported in the Abu Dhabi Emirate, UAE, according to symptomatic state, and identified factors associated with the symptomatic state. Also, the strength of association between the symptomatic state and testing positive in three subsequent RT-PCR testing rounds was examined and quantified.

MethodWe analyzed data collected from the first cohort of the RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the health authorities in the Abu Dhabi Emirate - UAE between February 28 and April 08, 2020. Self-reported sociodemographic, working status, travel history, and chronic comorbidities of 1,249 COVID-19 cases were analyzed according to symptomatic state (symptomatic and asymptomatic). After the first RT-PCR confirmatory test, the results of three subsequent testing rounds were also analyzed.

ResultsA total of 791 confirmed cases with a mean age of 35.6 years{+/-}12.7 (range: 1-81 years) and information on symptomatic state were analyzed. Nearly, 57.0% were symptomatic COVID-19 cases. The most frequent two symptoms were fever (58.0%) and cough (41.0%). The mean age of symptomatic (36.3 year {+/-}12.6SD) was significantly higher than that of asymptomatic cases (34.5 year {+/-}12.7SD). Compared to non-working populations, working in public places (aOR, 1.76, 95% CI: 1.11-2.80), healthcare settings (aOR, 2.09, 95% CI: 1.01-4.31), or in aviation and tourism sector (aOR, 2.24, 95% CI: 1.14-4.40), were independently associated with symptomatic state. Reporting at least one chronic comorbidity was also associated with symptomatic cases (aOR, 1.76, 95% CI: 1.03-3.01). Compared to asymptomatic, symptomatic COVID-19 cases had consistent odds of two or more of testing positive to COVID-19 in three subsequent testing rounds.

ConclusionsA substantial proportion of the diagnosed COVID-19 cases in the Abu Dhabi Emirate was asymptomatic. Quarantine of asymptomatic cases along with prevention measures and raising awareness of populations working in high-risk settings is warranted. Further follow up research is needed to understand viral clearance and clinical outcomes according to the symptomatic state of the COVID-19 cases.","Al-Rifai, R. H.; Acuna, J.; Al Hossany, F.

16993,"Detecting COVID-19 infection hotspots in England using large-scale self-reported data from a mobile application: a prospective, observational study","BackgroundAs many countries seek to slow the spread of COVID-19 without reimposing national restrictions, it has become important to track the disease at a local level to identify areas in need of targeted intervention.

MethodsWe performed modelling on longitudinal, self-reported data from users of the COVID Symptom Study app in England between 24 March and 29 September, 2020. Combining a symptom-based predictive model for COVID-19 positivity and RT-PCR tests provided by the Department of Health we were able to estimate disease incidence, prevalence and effective reproduction number. Geographically granular estimates were used to highlight regions with rapidly increasing case numbers, or hotspots.

FindingsMore than 2.8 million app users in England provided 120 million daily reports of their symptoms, and recorded the results of 170,000 PCR tests. On a national level our estimates of incidence and prevalence showed similar sensitivity to changes as two national community surveys: the ONS and REACT-1 studies. On 28 September 2020 we estimated 15,841 (95% CI 14,023-17,885) daily cases, a prevalence of 0.53% (95% CI 0.45-0.60), and R(t) of 1.17 (95% credible interval 1.15-1.19) in England. On a geographically granular level, on 28 September 2020 we detected 15 of the 20 regions with highest incidence according to Government test data, with indications that our method may be able to detect rapid case increases in regions where Government testing provision is more limited.

InterpretationSelf-reported data from mobile applications can provide an agile resource to inform policymakers during a fast-moving pandemic, serving as an independent and complementary resource to more traditional instruments for disease surveillance.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSTo identify instances of the use of digital tools to perform COVID-19 surveillance, we searched PubMed for peer-reviewed articles between 1 January and 14 October 2020, using the keywords COVID-19 AND ((mobile application) OR (web tool) OR (digital survey)). Of the 382 results, we found eight that utilised user-reported data to ascertain a users COVID-19 status. Of these, none sought to provide disease surveillance on a national level, or to compare these predictions to other tools to ascertain their accuracy. Furthermore, none of these papers sought to use their data to highlight geographical areas of concern.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, we provide the first demonstration of mobile technology to provide national-level disease surveillance. Using over 120 million reports from more than 2.8 million users across England, we estimate incidence, prevalence, and the effective reproduction number. We compare these estimates to those from national community surveys to understand the effectiveness of these digital tools. Furthermore, we demonstrate the large number of users can be used to provide disease surveillance with high geographical granularity, potentially providing a valuable source of information for policymakers seeking to understand the spread of the disease.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur findings suggest that mobile technology can be used to provide real-time data on the national and local state of the pandemic, enabling policymakers to make informed decisions in a fast-moving pandemic.","Varsavsky, T.; Graham, M.

10589,Pareto-based evaluation of national responses to COVID-19 pandemic shows that saving lives and protecting economy are non-trade-off objectives,"Countries worldwide have adopted various strategies to minimize the socio-economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Stringency and efficacy of imposed measures vary due to diversity of organizational cultures and ingrained societal practices, but also universally reflect the standpoint from which protecting public health and saving economy are seen as contradictory objectives. We analyzed cumulative deaths per capita and cumulative mobility reduction related to the decrease of economic activity in terms of Pareto optimality to show that as long as epidemic suppression is the aim, the trade-off between the death toll and economic loss is illusory: high death toll correlates with deep lockdown and thus, very likely, with severe economic downturn. We explained this effect by analyzing national epidemic trajectories in the mobility reduction vs. reproduction number (R) plane. When the number of daily new infections is high, mobility reduction is the only way to bring R below 1, but when new infections become sporadic, the epidemic can be suppressed by efficient testing complemented by relatively mild restrictions. South American trajectories suggest that lifting mobility restrictions at R > 1 may ultimately lead to the ""herd immunity scenario"", in which transient lockdown only adds economic costs to an inevitably high death toll.","Kochanczyk, M.; Lipniacki, T.",2020-12-01,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.06.27.20141747,2,Tomasz Lipniacki,"Institute of Fundamental Technological Research, Polish Academy of Sciences",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.27.20141747v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.27.20141747v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
17151,"A Machine Learning Study of 534,023 Medicare Beneficiaries with COVID-19: Implications for Personalized Risk Prediction","BackgroundGlobal demand for a COVID-19 vaccine will exceed the initial limited supply. Identifying individuals at highest risk of COVID-19 death may help allocation prioritization efforts. Personalized risk prediction that uses a broad range of comorbidities requires a cohort size larger than that reported in prior studies.

MethodsMedicare claims data was used to identify patients age 65 years or older with diagnosis of COVID-19 between April 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020. Demographic characteristics, chronic medical conditions, and other patient risk factors that existed before the advent of COVID-19 were identified. A random forest model was used to empirically explore factors associated with COVID-19 death. The independent impact of factors identified were quantified using multivariate logistic regression with random effects.

ResultsWe identified 534,023 COVID-19 patients of whom 38,066 had an inpatient death. Demographic characteristics associated with COVID-19 death included advanced age (85 years or older: aOR: 2.07; 95% CI, 1.99-2.16), male sex (aOR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.82-1.94), and non-white race (Hispanic: aOR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.66-1.83). Leading comorbidities associated with COVID-19 mortality included sickle cell disease (aOR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.21-2.47), chronic kidney disease (aOR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.29-1.36), leukemias and lymphomas (aOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.14-1.30), heart failure (aOR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.16-1.22), and diabetes (aOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.15-1.22).

ConclusionsWe created a personalized risk prediction calculator to identify candidates for early vaccine and therapeutics allocation (www.predictcovidrisk.com).

1940,"Neurological Manifestations of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective case series study","OBJECTIVETo study the neurological manifestations of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

DESIGNRetrospective case series

SETTINGThree designated COVID-19 care hospitals of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China.

PARTICIPANTSTwo hundred fourteen hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome from coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Data were collected from 16 January 2020 to 19 February 2020.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESClinical data were extracted from electronic medical records and reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Neurological symptoms fall into three categories: central nervous system (CNS) symptoms or diseases (headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, ataxia, acute cerebrovascular disease, and epilepsy), peripheral nervous system (PNS) symptoms (hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypopsia, and neuralgia), and skeletal muscular symptoms. Data of all neurological symptoms were checked by two trained neurologists.

RESULTSOf 214 patients studied, 88 (41.1%) were severe and 126 (58.9%) were non-severe patients. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were older (58.7 {+/-} 15.0 years vs 48.9 {+/-} 14.7 years), had more underlying disorders (42 [47.7%] vs 41 [32.5%]), especially hypertension (32 [36.4%] vs 19 [15.1%]), and showed less typical symptoms such as fever (40 [45.5%] vs 92 [73%]) and cough (30 [34.1%] vs 77 [61.1%]). Seventy-eight (36.4%) patients had neurologic manifestations. More severe patients were likely to have neurologic symptoms (40 [45.5%] vs 38 [30.2%]), such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%]), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]) and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%]).

CONCLUSIONCompared with non-severe patients with COVID-19, severe patients commonly had neurologic symptoms manifested as acute cerebrovascular diseases, consciousness impairment and skeletal muscle symptoms.","Mao, L.; Wang, M.; Chen, S.; He, Q.; Chang, J.; Hong, C.; Zhou, Y.; Wang, D.; Li, Y.; Jin, H.; Hu, B.",2020-02-25,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.02.22.20026500,1,Bo Hu,"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026500v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026500v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
10961,Daily viral kinetics and innate and adaptive immune responses assessment in COVID-19: a case series,"BackgroundViral shedding patterns and its correlation with the immune responses of mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients are still poorly characterized.

MethodsWe enrolled the first five COVID-19 patients quarantined in our institution; none received immunomodulatory treatment. We monitored shedding of viral RNA and infectious virus by RT-PCR and cell culture from the upper respiratory tract, and characterized the kinetics of systemic innate and adaptive immune responses.

ResultsDespite mild clinical disease, high viral loads and shedding of infectious virus were observed from the respiratory tract, with isolation of infectious virus and prolonged positivity by PCR up to day 7 and 19 post onset of symptoms, respectively. Robust innate responses characterized by an increase in activated CD14+CD16+ monocytes and cytokine responses were observed as early as 2 days after symptoms onset. Cellular and humoral SARS-CoV-2 specific adaptive responses were detectable in all patients.

ConclusionInfectious virus shedding was limited to the first week of symptom onset in mild cases. A strong innate response, characterized by the mobilization of activated monocytes during the first days of infection, as well as SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were detectable, even in patients with mild disease.

SummaryWe describe viral and immune profiles of the first five SARS-CoV-2 patients in our institution, showing high viral loads and infectious viral shedding in early acute disease. Mild patients mount an innate response sufficient for viral control and specific immunity.","Vetter, P.; Eberhardt, C.; Meyer, B.; Martinez, P.; Torriani, G.; Pigny, F.; Lemeille, S.; Cordey, S.; Laubscher, F.; Vu, D.-L.; Calame, A.; Schibler, M.; Jacquerioz, F.; Blanchard, G.; Siegrist, C.-A.; Kaiser, L.; Didierlaurent, A.; Eckerle, I.",2020-07-06,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.07.02.20143271,1,Pauline Vetter,Geneva University Hospitals,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20143271v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20143271v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1128/mSphere.00827-20
4878,Persistent viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces - a rapid review,"AimIn addition to respiratory symptoms, COVID-19 can present with gastrointestinal complaints suggesting possible faeco-oral transmission. The primary aim of this review was to establish the incidence and timing of positive faecal samples for SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19.

MethodsA systematic literature review identified studies describing COVID-19 patients tested for faecal virus. Search terms for Medline included  clinical,  faeces,  gastrointestinal secretions,  stool,  COVID-19,  SARS-CoV-2 and  2019-nCoV. Additional searches were done in AJG, Gastroenterology, Gut, Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology, The WHO Database, CEBM, NEJM, social media and the NICE, bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints. Data were extracted concerning the type of test, number and timing of positive samples, incidence of positive faecal tests after negative nasopharyngeal swabs and evidence of viable faecal virus or faeco-oral transmission of the virus.

ResultsThere were 26 relevant articles identified. Combining study results demonstrated that 53{middle dot}9% of those tested for faecal RNA were positive. Duration of faecal viral shedding ranged from 1 to 33 days after a negative nasopharyngeal swab with one result remaining positive 47 days after onset of symptoms. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that COVID-19 is transmitted via faecally shed virus.

ConclusionThere is a high rate of positive PCR tests with persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in faecal samples of patients with COVID-19. Further research is needed to confirm if this virus is viable and the degree of transmission through the faeco-oral route. This may have important implications on isolation, recommended precautions and protective equipment for interventional procedures involving the gastrointestinal tract.","Gupta, S.; Parker, J.; Smits, S.; Underwood, J.; Dolwani, S.",2020-05-05,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.17.20069526,3,Sunil Dolwani,Cardiff University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069526v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069526v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1111/codi.15138
4037,Noisy Pooled PCR for Virus Testing,"Fast testing can help mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite their accuracy for single sample analysis, infectious diseases diagnostic tools, like RT-PCR, require substantial resources to test large populations. We develop a scalable approach for determining the viral status of pooled patient samples. Our approach converts group testing to a linear inverse problem, where false positives and negatives are interpreted as generated by a noisy communication channel, and a message passing algorithm estimates the illness status of patients. Numerical results reveal that our approach estimates patient illness using fewer pooled measurements than existing noisy group testing algorithms. Our approach can easily be extended to various applications, including where false negatives must be minimized. Finally, in a Utopian world we would have collaborated with RT-PCR experts; it is difficult to form such connections during a pandemic.

9373,"Population-scale Longitudinal Mapping of COVID-19 Symptoms, Behavior, and Testing Identifies Contributors to Continued Disease Spread in the United States","Summary ParagraphDespite social distancing and shelter-in-place policies, COVID-19 continues to spread in the United States. A lack of timely information about factors influencing COVID-19 spread and testing has hampered agile responses to the pandemic. We developed How We Feel, an extensible web and mobile application that aggregates self-reported survey responses, to fill gaps in the collection of COVID-19-related data. How We Feel collects longitudinal and geographically localized information on users health, behavior, and demographics. Here we report results from over 500,000 users in the United States from April 2, 2020 to May 12, 2020. We show that self-reported surveys can be used to build predictive models of COVID-19 test results, which may aid in identification of likely COVID-19 positive individuals. We find evidence among our users for asymptomatic or presymptomatic presentation, as well as for household and community exposure, occupation, and demographics being strong risk factors for COVID-19. We further reveal factors for which users have been SARS-CoV-2 PCR tested, as well as the temporal dynamics of self-reported symptoms and self-isolation behavior in positive and negative users. These results highlight the utility of collecting a diverse set of symptomatic, demographic, and behavioral self-reported data to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.","Allen, W.

17306,Deep Learning Model for Improving the Characterization of Coronavirus on Chest X-ray Images Using CNN,"The novel Coronavirus, also known as Covid19, is a pandemic that has weighed heavily on the socio-economic affairs of the world. Although researches into the production of relevant vaccine are being advanced, there is, however, a need for a computational solution to mediate the process of aiding quick detection of the disease. Different computational solutions comprised of natural language processing, knowledge engineering and deep learning have been adopted for this task. However, deep learning solutions have shown interesting performance compared to other methods. This paper therefore aims to advance the application deep learning technique to the problem of characterization and detection of novel coronavirus. The approach adopted in this study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model which is further enhanced using the technique of data augmentation. The motive for the enhancement of the CNN model through the latter technique is to investigate the possibility of further improving the performances of deep learning models in detection of coronavirus. The proposed model is then applied to the COVID-19 X-ray dataset in this study which is the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Chest X-Ray dataset obtained from Kaggle for the purpose of promoting early detection and screening of coronavirus disease. Results obtained showed that our approach achieved a performance of 100% accuracy, recall/precision of 0.85, F-measure of 0.9, and specificity of 1.0. The proposed CNN model and data augmentation solution may be adopted in pre-screening suspected cases of Covid19 to provide support to the use of the well-known RT-PCR testing.","Oyelade, O.

20222,"Efficacy of propolis as an adjunct treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients: a randomized, controlled clinical trial","Among candidate treatment options for COVID-19, propolis, produced by honey bees from bioactive plant exudates, has shown potential against viral targets and has demonstrated immunoregulatory properties. We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label, single center trial, with a standardized propolis product (EPP-AF) on hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients. Patients received standard care plus propolis at an oral dose of 400mg/day (n=40) or 800mg/day (n=42) for seven days, or standard care alone (n=42). Standard care included all necessary interventions, as determined by the attending physician. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement defined as the length of hospital stay or oxygen therapy dependency. Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury and need for intensive care or vasoactive drugs. Time in the hospital after intervention was significantly shortened in both propolis groups compared to the controls; median 7 days with 400mg/day and 6 days with 800mg/day, versus 12 days for standard care alone. Propolis did not significantly affect the need for oxygen supplementation. With the higher dose, significantly fewer patients developed acute kidney injury than in the controls (2 versus 10 of 42 patients). Propolis as an adjunct treatment was safe and reduced hospitalization time. The registration number for this clinical trial is: NCT04480593 (20/07/2020).","Silveira, M. A. D.; De Jong, D.; Galvao, E.

5184,The impact of changes in diagnostic testing practices on estimates of COVID-19 transmission in the United States,"Estimates of the reproductive number for novel pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 are essential for understanding the potential trajectory of the epidemic and the level of intervention that is needed to bring the epidemic under control. However, most methods for estimating the basic reproductive number (R0) and time-varying effective reproductive number (Rt) assume that the fraction of cases detected and reported is constant through time. We explore the impact of secular changes in diagnostic testing and reporting on estimates of R0 and Rt using simulated data. We then compare these patterns to data on reported cases of COVID-19 and testing practices from different United States (US) states. We find that changes in testing practices and delays in reporting can result in biased estimates of R0 and Rt. Examination of changes in the daily number of tests conducted and the percent of patients testing positive may be helpful for identifying the potential direction of bias. Changes in diagnostic testing and reporting processes should be monitored and taken into consideration when interpreting estimates of the reproductive number of COVID-19.","Pitzer, V.

12432,Predicting Onset of COVID-19 with Mobility-Augmented SEIR Model,"Timely interventions and early preparedness of healthcare resources are crucial measures to tackle the COVID-19 disease. To aid these efforts, we developed the Mobility-Augmented SEIR model (MA-SEIR) that leverages Googles aggregate and anonymized mobility data to augment classic compartmental models. We show in a retrospective analysis how this method can be applied at an early stage in the COVID-19 epidemic to forecast its subsequent spread and onset in different geographic regions, with minimal parameterization of the model. This provides insight into the role of near real-time aggregate mobility data in disease spread modeling by quantifying substantial changes in how populations move both locally and globally. These changes would be otherwise very hard to capture using less timely data.","Wu, N.; Ben, X.; Green, B.; Rough, K.; Venkatramanan, S.; Marathe, M.; Eastham, P.; Sadilek, A.; O'banion, S.",2020-10-05,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.27.20159996,2,Adam Sadilek,"Google, LLC",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.20159996v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.20159996v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

6299,Quantifying the social distancing privilege gap: a longitudinal study of smartphone movement,"BackgroundIn response to the coronavirus pandemic, social distancing became a widely deployed countermeasure in March 2020. We examined whether healthier and wealthier places more successfully implemented social distancing.

MethodsMobile device location data were used to quantify declines in movement by county (n=2,633) in the United States of America, comparing April 15-17 (n=65,544,268 traces) to baseline of February 17 - March 7. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate gradients of privilege across eleven healthcare and economic indicators, adjusting for rurality and stay-at-home mandates. External validation used separate venue-specific data from Google Location Services.

FindingsCounties without stay-at-home orders showed a mobility decline of -52{middle dot}3% (95% CI: -50{middle dot}3%, -54{middle dot}3%), slightly less than the decline in mandated areas (-60{middle dot}8%; 95% CI: -60{middle dot}0%, -61{middle dot}6%). Strong linear gradients in privilege were observed. After adjusting for rurality and stay-at-home orders, counties in the highest quintile of social distancing mobility restriction had: 52% less uninsured, 47% more primary care providers, 29% more exercise space, 27% less food insecurity, 26% less child poverty, 17% higher incomes, 14% less overcrowding, 9{middle dot}6% more racial segregation, 8{middle dot}2% less youth, 7{middle dot}4% more elderly, and 6{middle dot}2% less influenza vaccination, compared to least social distancing areas.

InterpretationHealthier and wealthier counties displayed a social distancing privilege gap, measured via smartphone mobility change. Structural inequities in this key countermeasure will influence immunity, and disease incidence and mortality.

19694,Macrolevel Association of COVID-19 with Non-Communicable Disease Risk Factors in India,"ObjectiveGreater COVID-19 related mortality has been reported among persons with various non-communicable diseases (NCDs). We performed an ecological study to determine the association of state-level cases and deaths with NCD risk factors and healthcare and social indices.

MethodsWe obtained cumulative national and state-level data on COVID-19 cases and deaths from publicly available database www.covid19india.org from February to end November 2020. To identify association with major NCD risk factors, NCDs, healthcare related and social variables we obtained data from public sources. Association was determined using univariate and multivariate statistics.

ResultsMore than 9.5 million COVID-19 cases and 135,000 deaths have been reported in India at end November 2020. There is significant positive correlation (Pearsons r) of state-level COVID-19 cases and deaths per million, respectively, with NCD risk factors- obesity (0.64, 0.52), hypertension (0.28, 0.16), diabetes (0.66, 0.46), literacy, NCD epidemiological transition index (0.58, 0.54) and ischemic heart disease mortality (0.22, 0.33). Correlation is also observed with indices of healthcare access and quality (0.71, 0.61), urbanization (0.75, 0.73) and human (0.61, 0.56) and sociodemographic (0.70, 0.69) development. Multivariate adjusted analyses shows strong correlation of COVID-19 burden and deaths with NCD risk factors (r2=0.51, 0.43), NCDs (r2=0.32, 0.16) and healthcare related factors (r2=0.52, 0.38).

ConclusionsCOVID-19 disease burden and mortality in India is ecologically associated with greater state-level burden of NCDs and risk factors, especially obesity and diabetes.

KEY MESSAGESO_LIThere is significant state-level variability in COVID-19 cases and deaths in India.

20794,A 3D CNN Classification Model for Accurate Diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 using Computed Tomography Images,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly around the world. As of August 25, 2020, 23.719 million people have been infected in many countries. The cumulative death toll exceeds 812,000. Early detection of COVID-19 is essential to provide patients with appropriate medical care and protect uninfected people. Leveraging a large computed tomography (CT) database from 1,112 patients provided by China Consortium of Chest CT Image Investigation (CC-CCII), we investigated multiple solutions in detecting COVID-19 and distinguished it from other common pneumonia (CP) and normal controls. We also compared the performance of different models for complete and segmented CT slices. In particular, we studied the effects of CT-superimposition depths into volumes on the performance of our models. The results show that the optimal model can identify the COVID-19 slices with 99.76% accuracy (99.96% recall, 99.35% precision and 99.65% F1-score). The overall performance for three-way classification obtained 99.24% accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.9986. To the best of our knowledge, our method achieves the highest accuracy and recall with the largest public available COVID-19 CT dataset.

9801,Can we trust the prediction model? Demonstrating the importance of external validation by investigating the COVID-19 Vulnerability (C-19) Index across an international network of observational healthcare datasets,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 is straining healthcare systems globally. The burden on hospitals during the pandemic could be reduced by implementing prediction models that can discriminate between patients requiring hospitalization and those who do not. The COVID-19 vulnerability (C-19) index, a model that predicts which patients will be admitted to hospital for treatment of pneumonia or pneumonia proxies, has been developed and proposed as a valuable tool for decision making during the pandemic. However, the model is at high risk of bias according to the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool and has not been externally validated.

MethodsWe followed the OHDSI framework for external validation to assess the reliability of the C-19 model. We evaluated the model on two different target populations: i) 41,381 patients that have SARS-CoV-2 at an outpatient or emergency room visit and ii) 9,429,285 patients that have influenza or related symptoms during an outpatient or emergency room visit, to predict their risk of hospitalization with pneumonia during the following 0 to 30 days. In total we validated the model across a network of 14 databases spanning the US, Europe, Australia and Asia.

FindingsThe internal validation performance of the C-19 index was a c-statistic of 0.73 and calibration was not reported by the authors. When we externally validated it by transporting it to SARS-CoV-2 data the model obtained c-statistics of 0.36, 0.53 (0.473-0.584) and 0.56 (0.488-0.636) on Spanish, US and South Korean datasets respectively. The calibration was poor with the model under-estimating risk. When validated on 12 datasets containing influenza patients across the OHDSI network the c-statistics ranged between 0.40-0.68.

InterpretationThe results show that the discriminative performance of the C-19 model is low for influenza cohorts, and even worse amongst COVID-19 patients in the US, Spain and South Korea. These results suggest that C-19 should not be used to aid decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight the importance of performing external validation across a range of settings, especially when a prediction model is being extrapolated to a different population. In the field of prediction, extensive validation is required to create appropriate trust in a model.","Reps, J. M.; Kim, C.; Williams, R. D.; Markus, A. F.; Yang, C.; Salles, T.

10543,Effects of Anticoagulants and Corticosteroids therapy in patients affected by severe COVID-19 Pneumonia,"BackgroundIn the absence of a standard of treatment for COVID-19, the combined use of anti-inflammatory (corticosteroids and Enoxaparin) and antiviral drugs may be more effective than using either modality alone in the treatment of COVID-19.

MethodsPatients hospitalized between April 10th, 2020, through May 10th, 2020, who had confirmed COVID-19 infection with clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, in which 65 patients have moderate COVID-19 pneumonia, and 63 patients have severe COVID-19 pneumonia. All patients received early combination therapy of anti-inflammatory (corticosteroids and Enoxaparin) and antiviral drugs. They assessed for type and duration of treatment, and days need to wean from oxygen therapy, length of stay, virus clearance time, and complication or adverse events. All patients had more than 28 days follow up after discharge from the hospital.

ResultsModerate COVID-19 pneumonia group were 65 patients who received Enoxaparin, antiviral drugs, empirical antibiotics for pneumonia, and standard treatment for comorbidity. Male patients were 50 (76.9 %) and female patients were 15 (23.1 %). 34 (52.3 %) patients have comorbidity, 25 (38.5%) patients have Diabetes Mellitus and 2 (3.1 %) pregnant ladies. 19 (29.2 %) patients were on low flow oxygen therapy, 3L oxygen or less to maintain oxygen saturation more than 92%. All patients discharged home with no major or minor bleeding complications or significant complications. Severe COVID-19 pneumonia group were 63 patients who received methylprednisolone, enoxaparin, antiviral drugs, empirical antibiotics for pneumonia, and standard treatment for comorbidity. Male patients were 55 (87.3 %) and female patients were 8 (12.7 %). 37 (58.7 %) patients have comorbidity, and 24 (38.1%) patients have Diabetes Mellitus. 32 (50.8 %) patients were on low flow oxygen therapy, 4-9L oxygen, and 31 (49.2 %) patients were on low flow oxygen therapy, 10L oxygen or more, including 12 patients on a non-rebreathing mask. Patients received methylprednisolone were 37 (58.7 %) for 3 days, 16 (25.4 %) for 5 days and 10 (15.9 %) for more than 5 days. Sixty-two patients discharged home with one patient had a long stay, and the other two transferred to ICU. One long-stay patient transferred to ICU on low flow oxygen therapy.

5513,Clinical Laboratory Parameters Associated with Severe or Critical Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"BackgroundTo date, several clinical laboratory parameters associated with COVID-19 severity have been reported. However, these parameters have not been observed consistently across studies. The aim of this review was to assess clinical laboratory parameters which may serve as markers or predictors of severe or critical COVID-19 disease

MethodsWe conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL and Google Scholar databases from 2019 through April 18, 2020, and reviewed bibliographies of eligible studies, relevant systematic reviews, and the medRxiv pre-print server. We included hospital-based observational studies reporting clinical laboratory parameters of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and excluded studies having large proportions (>10%) of children and pregnant women. Two authors independently carried out screening of articles, data extraction and quality assessment. Meta-analyses were done using random effects model. Meta-median difference (MMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each laboratory parameter.

ResultsForty-five studies in 6 countries were included. Compared to non-severe COVID-19 cases, severe or critical COVID-19 disease was characterised by higher neutrophil count (MMD: 1.23 [95% CI: 0.58 to 1.88] x109 cells/L), and lower lymphocyte and CD4 counts with MMD (95% CI) of -0.39 (-0.47, -0.31) x109 cells/L and -204.9 (-302.6, -107.1) cells/l, respectively. Other notable results were observed for C-reactive protein (MMD: 36.97 [95% CI: 27.58, 46.35] mg/L), interleukin-6 (MMD: 17.37 [95% CI: 4.74, 30.00] pg/ml,), Troponin I (MMD: 0.01 [0.00, 0.02] ng/ml), and D-dimer (MMD: 0.65 [0.45, 0.85] mg/ml).

Conclusions and RelevanceRelative to non-severe COVID-19, severe or critical COVID-19 is characterised by increased markers of innate immune response, decreased markers of adaptive immune response, and increased markers of tissue damage and major organ failure. These markers could be used to recognise severe or critical disease and to monitor clinical course of COVID-19.","Moutchia, J.; Pokharel, P.; Kerri, A.; Mcgaw, K.; Uchai, S.; Nji, M.; Goodman, M.",2020-04-29,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.24.20078782,1,Jude Moutchia,EHESP French School of Public Health,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.24.20078782v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.24.20078782v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1371/journal.pone.0239802
13966,Viral RNA load in plasma is associated with critical illness and a dysregulated host response in COVID-19.,"BackgroundSevere COVID-19 is characterized by clinical and biological manifestations typically observed in sepsis. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is commonly detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, however viral RNA can be found also in peripheral blood and other tissues.

Whether systemic spreading of the virus or viral components plays a role in the pathogenesis of the sepsis-like disease observed in severe COVID-19 is currently unknown.

MethodsWe determined the association of plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA with the biological responses and the clinical severity of patients with COVID-19. 250 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited (50 outpatients, 100 hospitalised ward patients, and 100 critically ill). The association between plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA and laboratory parameters was evaluated using multivariate GLM with a gamma distribution. The association between plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA and severity was evaluated using multivariate ordinal logistic regression analysis and Generalized Linear Model (GLM) analysis with a binomial distribution.

ResultsThe presence of SARS-CoV-2-RNA viremia was independently associated with a number of features consistently identified in sepsis: 1) high levels of cytokines (including CXCL10, CCL-2, IL-10, IL-1ra, IL-15, and G-CSF); 2) higher levels of ferritin and LDH; 3) low lymphocyte and monocyte counts 4) and low platelet counts. In hospitalised patients, the presence of SARS-CoV-2-RNA viremia was independently associated with critical illness: (adjusted OR= 8.30 [CI95%=4.21 - 16.34], p < 0.001). CXCL10 was the most accurate identifier of SARS-CoV-2-RNA viremia in plasma (area under the curve (AUC), [CI95%], p) = 0.85 [0.80 - 0.89), <0.001]), suggesting its potential role as a surrogate biomarker of viremia. The cytokine IL-15 most accurately differentiated clinical ward patients from ICU patients (AUC: 0.82 [0.76 - 0.88], <0.001).

Conclusionssystemic dissemination of genomic material of SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a sepsis-like biological response and critical illness in patients with COVID-19. RNA viremia could represent an important link between SARS-CoV-2 infection, host response dysfunction and the transition from moderate illness to severe, sepsis-like COVID-19 disease.","Bermejo-Martin, J.

1730,Effectiveness of interventions targeting air travellers for delaying local outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundWe evaluated if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay local SARS-CoV-2 community transmission in a previously unaffected country.

MethodsWe simulated infected air travellers arriving into countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission or other introduction routes from affected regions. We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival & traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduces the average number of secondary cases. We use stochastic simulations to account for uncertainty in both arrival and secondary infections rates, and present sensitivity analyses on arrival rates of infected travellers and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation. We report the median expected delay achievable in each scenario and an inner 50% interval.

ResultsUnder baseline assumptions, introducing exit and entry screening in combination with traveller sensitisation can delay a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by 8 days (50% interval: 3-14 days) when the rate of importation is 1 infected traveller per week at time of introduction. The additional benefit of entry screening is small if exit screening is effective: the combination of only exit screening and traveller sensitisation can delay an outbreak by 7 days (50% interval: 2-13 days). In the absence of screening, with less effective sensitisation, or a higher rate of importation, these delays shrink rapidly to less than 4 days.

ConclusionSyndromic screening and traveller sensitisation in combination may have marginally delayed SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in unaffected countries.","Clifford, S. J.; Pearson, C. A.

ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to develop a new primer-probe set targeting N gene of SARS-CoV-2 to improve the sensitivity for detection of COVID-19(Corona Virus Disease 2019)in multiplex rRT-PCR (Reversetranscript Realtime PCR) and ddPCR (Droplet Digital PCR).

ResultsWe designed primers/probes set N(LZU3) targeting the N gene of 2019-nCov and proved its sensitivity in both rRT-PCR and ddPCR. When the quantity of template was 105 copies/reaction, the mean Ct value of N(LZU3) was 32.563, the detection rate was 91.7%. If the quantity of template was 52.5 copies/reaction, the mean Ct value of N(LZU3) was 33.835, and the detection rate was 83.3%, which were similar with that of N(CDC) and N(USA). The calculated lower limit of detection (LOD) of the new primer-probe set N(LZU3) used in rRT-PCR was 118 copies/reaction. We also did one-step ddPCR for detection the same serial dilution of RNA template. It shows good linearity for primer/probe sets N(LZU3). The calculated lower limit of detection (LOD) of N(LZU3) was 22.4 copies/reaction, which was 1.12 copies/ul.

ConclusionThe novel primer-probe set(LZU3) targeting N gene of SARS-CoV-2 could be both used in rRT-PCR and ddPCR with better sensitivity, furthermore, ddPCR method had higer sensitivity than rRT-PCR, hence it could significantly improve SARS-CoV-2 detection efficiency in low virus load and asymptomatic infection.","Wang, F.; Pervaiz, U.; Tian, H.; Gahdary, M.

13376,Influence of adherence to social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity level in post-bariatric patients,"ObjectivesTo assess physical activity levels in post-bariatric patients who adhered or not to social distancing measures due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Our secondary aim was to compare physical activity estimates between objectively measured and self-reported physical activity level.

MethodsIn this descriptive, cross-sectional study, we assessed physical activity level using accelerometers and a validated questionnaire in 33 post-bariatric patients who reported to be adherent (n=15) or not (n=18) to social distancing measures.

ResultsPatients adherent to social distancing measures spent more time in sedentary behavior (1.1 hours/day [95%CI: 0.1, 2.2]; p=0.045) and less time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (-12.2 min/day [95%CI: -23.8, -0.6]; p=0.040) compared to non-adherent ones. No difference was observed for light-intensity physical activity. Bland-Altman analysis comparing objective and subjective physical activity estimates showed a bias for time spent in sedentary behavior and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity of 2.8 hours/day and 8.5 min/day, respectively.

ConclusionPost-bariatric patients who were adherent to social distancing measures due to the Covid-19 outbreak were more inactive and sedentary than non-adherent ones. Additionally, questionnaire data widely underestimated sedentary behavior. Strategies to increase or at least sustain physical activity levels in post-bariatric patients exposed to social distancing measures are necessary during the Covid-19 pandemic.

4256,"COVID-19 pandemic in the African continent: Forecasts of cumulative cases, new infections, and mortality","BackgroundThe epidemiology of COVID-19 remains speculative in Africa. To the best of our knowledge, no study, using robust methodology provides its trajectory for the region or accounts for local context. This paper is the first systematic attempt to provide prevalence, incidence, and mortality estimates across Africa.

MethodsCaseloads and incidence forecasts are from a co-variate-based instrumental variable regression model. Fatality rates from Italy and China were applied to generate mortality estimates after making relevant health system and population-level characteristics related adjustments between each of the African countries.

ResultsBy June 30 2020, around 16.3 million people in Africa will contract COVID-19 (95% CI 718,403 to 98,358,799). Northern and Eastern Africa will be the most and least affected areas. Cumulative cases by June 30 are expected to reach around 2.9 million (95% CI 465,028 to 18,286,358) in Southern Africa, 2.8 million (95% CI 517,489 to 15,056,314) in Western Africa, and 1.2 million (95% CI 229,111 to 6,138,692) in Central Africa. Incidence for the month of April 2020 is expected to be highest in Djibouti, 32.8 per 1000 (95% CI 6.25 to 171.77), while Morocco will experience among the highest fatalities (1,045 deaths, 95% CI 167 to 6,547).

ConclusionLess urbanized countries with low levels of socio-economic development (hence least connected to the world), are likely to register lower and slower transmissions at the early stages of an epidemic. However, the same enabling factors that worked for their benefit can hinder interventions that have lessened the impact of COVID-19 elsewhere.","Achoki, T.; Alam, U.; Were, L.; Gebremedhin, T.; Senkubuge, F.; Lesego, A.; Liu, S.; Wamai, R.; Kinfu, Y.",2020-04-28,Health Policy,10.1101/2020.04.09.20059154,3,Yohannes Kinfu,Canberra University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059154v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059154v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
18707,Convalescent Plasma in COVID-19. Mortality-Safety First Results of the Prospective Multicenter FALP 001-2020 Trial,"BackgroundThe use of convalescent plasma (CP) to treat COVID-19 has shown promising results; however, its effectiveness remains uncertain. The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and mortality of CP among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Study Design and MethodsThis multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled clinical trial is currently being conducted at nine hospitals in Chile. Patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 who were still within 14 days since symptom onset were classified into four groups: Patients with cancer and severe COVID-19. Patients with cancer and non-severe COVID-19. Patients with severe COVID-19 and patients with non-severe COVID-19 only. The intervention involved two 200-cc. CP transfusions with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers [&ge;] 1:320 collected from COVID-19-recovered donors.

Results192 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 received CP transfusions. At the first transfusion, 90.6% fulfilled the criteria for severity, and 41.1% required mechanical ventilation. 11.5% of the patients had cancer. Overall 7-day and 30-day mortality since the first CP transfusion was 5.7% and 16.1% respectively. There were no differences at either time point in mortality between the four groups. Patients on mechanical ventilation when receiving CP had higher mortality rates than those who were not (22.8% vs. 11.5%; p = 0.037). Overall 30-day mortality was higher in patients over 65 than in younger patients (p = 0.019). Severe adverse events were reported in four patients (2.1%) with an overall transfusion-related lung injury rate of 1.56%. No CP-related deaths occurred.

DiscussionCP is safe when used in patients with COVID-19 even when also presenting severity criteria or risk factors. Our mortality rate is comparable to reports from larger studies. Controlled clinical trials are required to determine efficacy.

4204,No evidence of clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection with oxygen requirement: results of a study using routinely collected data to emulate a target trial,"BackgroundTreatments are urgently needed to prevent respiratory failure and deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has received worldwide attention because of positive results from small studies.

MethodsWe used data collected from routine care of all adults in 4 French hospitals with documented SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and requiring oxygen [&ge;] 2 L/min to emulate a target trial aimed at assessing the effectiveness of HCQ at 600 mg/day. The composite primary endpoint was transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) within 7 days from inclusion and/or death from any cause. Analyses were adjusted for confounding factors by inverse probability of treatment weighting.

ResultsThis study included 181 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia; 84 received HCQ within 48 hours of admission (HCQ group) and 97 did not (no-HCQ group). Initial severity was well balanced between the groups. In the weighted analysis, 20.2% patients in the HCQ group were transferred to the ICU or died within 7 days vs 22.1% in the no-HCQ group (16 vs 21 events, relative risk [RR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.47-1.80). In the HCQ group, 2.8% of the patients died within 7 days vs 4.6% in the no-HCQ group (3 vs 4 events, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.13-2.89), and 27.4% and 24.1%, respectively, developed acute respiratory distress syndrome within 7 days (24 vs 23 events, RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.65-2.00). Eight patients receiving HCQ (9.5%) experienced electrocardiogram modifications requiring HCQ discontinuation.

5828,Early trends for SARS-CoV-2 infection in central and north Texas and impact on other circulating respiratory viruses,"IntroductionRapid diagnosis and isolation are key to containing the quick spread of a pandemic agent like SARS-CoV-2, which has spread globally since its initial outbreak in Wuhan province in China. SARS-CoV-2 is novel to most parts of the world including USA and the effect on typically prevalent seasonal viruses is just becoming apparent. We present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the month of March, 2020.

MethodsThis is a retrospective cohort study post launching of SARS-CoV-2 testing at Baylor Scott and White Hospital (BSWH), Temple TX. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed by real-time rRT-PCR assay and results were shared with State public health officials for immediate interventions.

ResultsMore than 3500 tests were performed during the first two weeks of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and identified 168 (4.7%) positive patients. Sixty-two (3.2%) of the 1,912 ambulatory patients and 106 (6.3%) of the 1,659 ED/inpatients were tested positive. Higher rate of infection (6.9%) were noted in the patients belonging to age group 25-34 years and least number of positive cases were noted in <25 years old (2%) group. The TX State county specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public health departments for epidemiological interventions.

Incidentally, this study showed that there was a significant decrease in the occurrence of infections due to seasonal respiratory viruses in this region, perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness, about SARS-CoV-2, among general public. Data extracted for BSWH from the CDCs National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) site revealed that Influenza incidence declined to 8.7% in March 2020 compared to 25% in March 2019.

ConclusionsThis study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and the role of laboratories in crisis management. This study provided SARS-CoV-2 testing data from ambulatory and inpatient population. Epidemiological interventions depend on timely availability of accurate diagnostic tests and throughput capacity of such systems during large outbreaks like SARS-CoV-2.","Mutnal, M. B.; Arroliga, A.

7746,Changes in premature birth rates during the Danish nationwide COVID-19 lockdown: a nationwide register-based prevalence proportion study,"ObjectivesTo explore the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on premature birth rates in Denmark

DesignNationwide register-based prevalence proportion study.

Participants31,180 live singleton infants born in Denmark between March 12, and April 14, during 2015 to 2020

Main outcome measuresMain outcome measure was the odds ratio of premature birth, per preterm category, during the lockdown period compared with the calendar match period in the five previous years.

ResultsA total of 31180 newborns were included in the study period, of these 58 were born extremely premature (gestational age below 28 weeks). The distribution of gestational ages was significantly different (p = 0{middle dot}004) during the lockdown period compared to the previous five years. The extremely premature birth rate during the lockdown was significantly lower than the corresponding mean rate for the same dates in the previous years (odds ratio 0{middle dot}09 [95 % CI 0{middle dot}01 - 0{middle dot}04], p < 0{middle dot}001). No significant difference between the lockdown and previous years was found for other gestational age categories.

ConclusionsThe birth rate of extremely premature infants decreased significantly (~90 % reduction) during the Danish nationwide lockdown from a stable rate in the preceding five years. The reasons for this decrease are unclear. Identification of possible causal mechanisms might stimulate changes in clinical practice. Ideally, some cases of extreme prematurity are preventable which may decrease infant morbidity and mortality.","Hedermann, G.; Hedley, P.

9561,Timing COVID-19 - Synchronization of longitudinal patient data to the underlying disease progression using CRP as a temporal marker,"Advances in medical technology and IT infrastructure have led to increased availability of continuous patient data that allows investigation of the longitudinal progression of novel and known diseases in unprecedented detail. However, to accurately describe any underlying pathophysiology with longitudinal data, the individual patient trajectories have to be synchronized based on temporal markers. In this study, we use longitudinal data from 28 critically ill ICU COVID-19 patients to compare the commonly used alignment markers ""onset of symptoms"", ""hospital admission"" and ""ICU admission"" with a novel objective method based on the peak value of inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP). By applying our CRP-based method to align the progression of neutrophils and lymphocytes, we were able to define a pathophysiological window that allowed further risk stratification in our COVID-19 patient cohort. Our data highlights that proper synchronization of patient data is crucial to differentiate severity subgroups and to allow reliable interpatient comparisons.","Maibach, M. A.; Allam, A.; Hilty, M.

Aim: The objectives of this study were to compare SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence and compliance to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) between HCWs working within (high-risk) or outside (intermediate-risk) units treating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. In addition, administration staff (low-risk) was included. Materials: Co-HCW is a prospective cohort study among employees at the Jena University Hospital, Germany. Since 16th March 2020, 50 SARS-CoV-2 inpatients and 73 outpatients were treated in our hospital. Mandatory masking was implemented on 20th March 2020. We here evaluated seroprevalence using two IgG detecting immunoassays, assessed COVID-19 exposure, clinical symptoms and compliance to wear PPE. Findings: Between 19th May and 19th June 2020 we analysed 660 employees [out of 3,228; 20.4%]. Eighteen participants (2.7%) had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in at least one immunoassay. Among them, 13 (72.2%) were not aware of direct COVID-19 exposure and 9 (50.0%) did not report any clinical symptoms. We observed no evidence for an association between seroprevalence and risk area (high-risk: 2 of 137 HCWs (1.5%), intermediate-risk: 10 of 343 HCWs (2.9%), low-risk: 6 of 180 administration employees (3.3%); p=0.574). Reported compliance to wear PPE differed (p<0.001) between working in high-risk (98.3%) and in intermediate-risk areas (69.8%). Conclusion: No evidence for higher seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs working in high-risk COVID-19 areas could be observed, probably due to high compliance to wear PPE. Compared to administration employees, we observed no additional risk to acquire SARS-CoV-2 infections by patient care.","Bahrs, C.; Kimmig, A.; Weis, S.; Ankert, J.; Hagel, S.; Maschmann, J.; Stallmach, A.; Steiner, A.; Bauer, M.; Behrigner, W.; Baier, M.; Kesselmeier, M.; Richert, C.; Zepf, F.; Walter, M.; Scherag, A.; Kiehntopf, M.; Loeffler, B.; Pletz, M.

ObjectiveTo investigate the efficacy and safety of vitamin D3 supplementation in patients with severe COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in two centers (a quaternary hospital and a field hospital) in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The trial included 240 hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. The study was conducted from June 2, 2020 to October 7, 2020.

InterventionsPatients were randomly allocated (1:1 ratio) to receive either a single oral dose of 200,000 IU of vitamin D3 or placebo.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was hospital length of stay, defined as hospital discharge from the date of randomization or death. Secondary outcomes were mortality, admission to ICU, mechanical ventilation requirement, and serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, creatinine, calcium, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer.

ResultsOf 240 randomized patients (mean age, 56 years; 56% men), 232 (96.7%) were included in the primary analysis. Log-rank test showed that hospital length of stay was comparable between the vitamin D3 supplementation and placebo groups (7.0 days [95% CI, 6.1 to 7.9] and 7.0 days [95% CI, 6.2 to 7.8 days]; hazard ratio, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.9 to 1.5]; P = .379; respectively). The rate of mortality (7.0% vs 5.1%; P = .590), admission to ICU (15.8% vs 21.2%; P = .314), and mechanical ventilation requirement (7.0% vs 14.4%; P = .090) did not significantly differ between groups. Vitamin D3 supplementation significantly increased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels compared to placebo (difference, 24.0 ng/mL [95% CI, 21.0% to 26.9%]; P = .001). No adverse events were observed.

Conclusions and RelevanceAmong hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, vitamin D3 supplementation was safe and increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, but did not reduce hospital length of stay or any other relevant outcomes vs placebo. This trial does not support the use of vitamin D3 supplementation as an adjuvant treatment of patients with COVID-19.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan vitamin D3 supplementation reduce hospital length of stay in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19?

FindingsIn this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving 240 hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, a single dose of 200,000 IU of vitamin D3 supplementation was safe and effective in increasing 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, but did not significantly reduce hospital length of stay (hazard ratio, 1.12) or any other clinically-relevant outcomes compared with placebo.

7390,Semantic and geographical analysis of Covid-19 trials reveals a fragmented clinical research landscape likely to impair informativeness.,"BackgroundThe unprecedented impact of the Covid-19 pandemics on modern society has ignited a ""gold rush"" for effective treatment and diagnostic strategies, with a significant diversion of economical, scientific and human resources towards dedicated clinical research. We aimed to describe trends in this rapidly changing landscape to inform adequate resource allocation.

MethodsWe developed informatic tools (Covid Trial Monitor) to analyze in real time growth rate, geographical distribution and characteristics of Covid-19 related trials. We defined structured semantic ontologies with controlled vocabularies to categorize trial interventions, study endpoints and study designs. Data and analyses are publicly available at https://bioinfo.ieo.it/shiny/app/CovidCT

ResultsWe observe a clear prevalence of monocentric trials with highly heterogeneous endpoints and a significant disconnect between geographic distribution and disease prevalence, implying that most countries would need to recruit unrealistic percentages of their total prevalent cases to fulfill enrolment.

ConclusionsThis geographically and methodologically incoherent growth sheds doubts on the actual feasibility of locally reaching target sample sizes and the probability of most of these trials providing reliable and transferable result. We call for the harmonization of clinical trial design criteria for Covid19 and the increased use of larger master protocols incorporating elements of adaptive designs.

3336,"Eco-epidemiological assessment of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, January-February 2020","BackgroundThe outbreak of COVID-19 in China in early 2020 provides a rich data source for exploring the ecological determinants of this new infection, which may be of relevance elsewhere.

ObjectivesAssessing the spread of the COVID-19 across China, in relation to associations between cases and ecological factors including population density, temperature, solar radiation and precipitation.

MethodsOpen-access COVID-19 case data include 18,069 geo-located cases in China during January and February 2020, which were mapped onto a 0.25{degrees} latitude/longitude grid together with population and weather data (temperature, solar radiation and precipitation). Of 15,539 grid cells, 559 (3.6%) contained at least one case, and these were used to construct a Poisson regression model of cell-weeks. Weather parameters were taken for the preceding week given the established 5-7 day incubation period for COVID-19. The dependent variable in the Poisson model was incident cases per cell-week and exposure was cell population, allowing for clustering of cells over weeks, to give incidence rate ratios.

ResultsThe overall COVID-19 incidence rate in cells with confirmed cases was 0.12 per 1,000. There was a single case in 113/559 (20.2%) of cells, while two grid cells recorded over 1,000 cases. Weekly means of maximum daily temperature varied from -28.0 to 30.1 {degrees}C, minimum daily temperature from -42.4 to 23.0 {degrees}C, maximum solar radiation from 0.04 to 2.74 MJm-2 and total precipitation from 0 to 72.6 mm. Adjusted incidence rate ratios suggested brighter, warmer and drier conditions were associated with lower incidence.

ConclusionThough not demonstrating cause and effect, there were appreciable associations between weather and COVID-19 incidence during the epidemic in China. This does not mean the pandemic will go away with summer weather but demonstrates the importance of using weather conditions in understanding and forecasting the spread of COVID-19.","Byass, P.",2020-03-31,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.03.29.20046565,1,Peter Byass,Umea University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.20046565v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.20046565v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1080/16549716.2020.1760490
9645,Upper-room ultraviolet air disinfection might help to reduce COVID-19 transmission in buildings,"As the world economies get out of the lockdown imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to assess the suitability of known technologies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in confined spaces such as buildings. This feasibility study looks at the method of upper-room ultraviolet (UV) air disinfection that has already proven its efficacy in preventing the transmission of airborne diseases such as measles and tuberculosis.

Using published data from various sources it is shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, is highly likely to be susceptible to UV damage while suspended in air irradiated by UV-C at levels that are acceptable and safe for upper-room applications. This is while humans are present in the room. Both the expected and worst-case scenarios are investigated to show the efficacy of the upper-room UV-C approach to reduce COVID-19 air transmission in a confined space with moderate but sufficient height. Discussion is given on the methods of analysis and the differences between virus susceptibility to UV-C when aerosolised or in liquid or on a surface.","Beggs, C. B.; Avital, E.

12168,Impact of Restrictions on Parental Presence in Neonatal Intensive Care Units Related to COVID-19,"ObjectivesTo determine the relationship between the emergence of COVID-19 and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) family presence as well as how NICU design affects these changes.

Study DesignA cross-sectional survey from April 21 to 30, 2020. We queried sites regarding NICU demographics, NICU restrictions on parental presence, and changes in ancillary staff availability.

ResultsGlobally, 277 facilities responded to the survey. NICU policies preserving 24/7 parental presence decreased (83% to 53%, p<0.001) and of preserving full parental participation in rounds fell (71% to 32%, p<0.001). Single family room design NICUs best preserved 24/7 parental presence after the emergence of COVID-19 (single family room 65%, hybrid-design 57%, open bay design 45%, p=.018). In all, 120 (43%) NICUs reported reductions in therapy services, lactation medicine, and/or social work support.

ConclusionsHospital restrictions have significantly limited parental presence for NICU admitted infants, although single family room design may attenuate this effect.","Darcey-Mahoney, A.; White, R.

16791,Serological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2: trends and humoral response in a cohort of public health workers,"BackgroundThere is considerable debate about the rate of antibody waning after SARS-CoV-2 infection, raising questions around long-term immunity following both natural infection and vaccination. We undertook prospective serosurveillance in a large cohort of healthy adults from the start of the epidemic in England.

MethodsThe serosurveillance cohort included office and laboratory-based staff and healthcare workers in 4 sites in England, who were tested monthly for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleoprotein IgG between 23rd March and 20th August 2020. Antibody levels from 21 days after a positive test were modelled using mixed effects regression models.

FindingsIn total, 2247 individuals were recruited and 2014 (90%) had 3-5 monthly antibody tests. Overall, 272 (12.1%) of individuals had at least one positive/equivocal spike protein IgG result, with the highest proportion in a hospital site (22%), 14% in London and 2.1% in a rural area. Results were similar for nucleoprotein IgG. Following a positive result, 39/587 (6.6%) tested negative for nucleoprotein IgG and 52/515 (10.1%) for spike protein IgG. Nucleoprotein IgG declined by 6.4% per week (95% CI, 5.5-7.4%; half-life, 75 [95% CI, 66-89] days) and spike protein IgG by 5.8% (95% CI, 5.1-6.6%; half-life, 83 [95% CI, 73-96] days).

ConclusionsOver the study period SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was 8-10% overall and up to 21% in clinical healthcare workers. In seropositive individuals, nucleoprotein and spike protein IgG antibodies declined with time after infection and 50% are predicted to fall below the positive test threshold after 6 months.

8344,Age separation dramatically reduces COVID-19 mortality rate in a computational model of a large population,"COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global lock down in many countries throughout the world. Faced with a new reality, and until a vaccine or efficient treatment is found, humanity must figure out ways to keep economy going on one hand, yet keep the population safe on the other hand, especially those that are susceptible to this virus. Here we use a network simulation, with parameters that were drawn from what is known about the virus, to explore 5 different scenarios of partial lock down release. We find that separating age groups by reducing interactions between age groups, protects the general population and reduces mortality rates. Furthermore, addition of new connections within the same age group to compensate for the lost connections outside the age group, still has a strong beneficial influence and reduces the total death toll by 66%. While complete isolation from society may be the most protective scenario for the elderly population, it would have an emotional and possibly cognitive impact that might outweigh its benefit. We therefore propose creating age-related social recommendations or even restrictions, thereby allowing social connections but still strong protection for the older population.","Mizrahi, L.; Stern, S.",2020-05-29,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.27.20111955,1,Shani Stern,University of Haifa,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.20111955v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.20111955v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1098/rsob.200213
16260,"The risk for a new COVID-19 wave -- and how it depends on $R_0$, the current immunity level and current restrictions","The COVID-19 pandemic has hit different parts of the world differently: some regions are still in the rise of the first wave, other regions are now facing a decline after a first wave, and yet other regions have started to see a second wave. The current immunity level i in a region is closely related to the cumulative fraction infected, which primarily depends on two factors: a) the initial potential for COVID-19 in the region (often quantified by the basic reproduction number R0), and b) the timing, amount and effectiveness of preventive measures put in place. By means of a mathematical model including heterogeneities owing to age, social activity and susceptibility, and allowing for time-varying preventive measures, the risk for a new epidemic wave and its doubling time, and how they depend on R0, i and the overall effect of the current preventive measures, are investigated. Focus lies on quantifying the minimal overall effect of preventive measures pMin needed to prevent a future outbreak. The first result shows that the current immunity level i plays a more influential roll than when immunity is obtained from vaccination. Secondly, by comparing regions with different R0 and i it is shown that regions with lower R0 and low i may now need higher preventive measures (pMin) compared with other regions having higher R0 but also higher i, even when such immunity levels are far from herd immunity.","Britton, T.; Trapman, P.; Ball, F.

13540,"Air pollution, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and COVID-19 outcomes: A state-of-the-science review of a rapidly evolving research area","BackgroundAs the coronavirus pandemic rages on, 692,000 (August 7, 2020) human lives and counting have been lost worldwide to COVID-19. Understanding the relationship between short- and long-term exposure to air pollution and adverse COVID-19 health outcomes is crucial for developing solutions to this global crisis.

ObjectivesTo conduct a scoping review of epidemiologic research on the link between short- and long-term exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 health outcomes.

MethodWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, MedRxiv, and BioRxiv for preliminary epidemiological studies of the association between air pollution and COVID-19 health outcomes. 28 papers were finally selected after applying our inclusion/exclusion criteria; we categorized these studies as long-term studies, short-term time-series studies, or short-term cross-sectional studies. One study included both short-term time-series and a cross-sectional study design.

Results27 studies of the 28 reported evidence of statistically significant positive associations between air pollutant exposure and adverse COVID-19 health outcomes; 11 of 12 long-term studies and all 16 short-term studies reported statistically significant positive associations. The 28 identified studies included various confounders, spatial and temporal resolutions of pollution concentrations, and COVID-19 health outcomes.

DiscussionWe discuss methodological challenges and highlight additional research areas based on our findings. Challenges include data quality issues, ecological study design limitations, improved adjustment for confounders, exposure errors related to spatial resolution, geographic variability in testing, mitigation measures and pandemic stage, clustering of health outcomes, and a lack of publicly available data and code.","Bhaskar, A.; Chandra, J.; Braun, D.; Cellini, J.; Dominici, F.",2020-08-20,Occupational And Environmental Health,10.1101/2020.08.16.20175901,1,Francesca Dominici,Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20175901v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20175901v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
4464,Modelling and analysis of COVID-19 epidemic in India.,"COVID-19 epidemic is declared as the public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organisation in the second week of March 2020.

The first case in India was reported on 30th January 2020, with the cases crossing 6000 on the day paper was written. Complete lockdown of the nation for 21 days and immediate isolation of infected cases are the proactive steps taken by the authorities. For a better understanding of the evolution of COVID-19 in the country, Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model is used in this paper. It is predicted that actual infectious population is ten times the reported positive case (quarantined) in the country. Also, a single case can infect 1.55 more individuals of the population. Epidemic doubling time is estimated to be around 4.1 days. All indicators are compared with Brazil and Italy as well. SIQR model has also predicted that India will see the peak with 22,000 active cases during the last week of April followed by reduction in active cases.

4999,Impaired type I interferon activity and exacerbated inflammatory responses in severe Covid-19 patients,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is a major global threat that has already caused more than 100,000 deaths worldwide. It is characterized by distinct patterns of disease progression implying a diverse host immune response. However, the immunological features and molecular mechanisms involved in Covid-19 severity remain so far poorly known.

MethodsWe performed an integrated immune analysis that included in-depth phenotypical profiling of immune cells, whole-blood transcriptomic and cytokine quantification on a cohort of fifty Covid19 patients with a spectrum of disease severity. All patient were tested 8 to 12 days following first symptoms and in absence of anti-inflammatory therapy.

ResultsA unique phenotype in severe and critically ill patients was identified. It consists in a profoundly impaired interferon (IFN) type I response characterized by a low interferon production and activity, with consequent downregulation of interferon-stimulated genes. This was associated with a persistent blood virus load and an exacerbated inflammatory response that was partially driven by the transcriptional factor NFB. It was also characterized by increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and interleukin (IL)-6 production and signaling as well as increased innate immune chemokines.

ConclusionWe propose that type-I IFN deficiency in the blood is a hallmark of severe Covid-19 and could identify and define a high-risk population. Our study provides a rationale for testing IFN administration combined with adapted anti-inflammatory therapy targeting IL-6 or TNF- in most severe patients. These data also raise concern for utilization of drugs that interfere with the IFN pathway.","Hadjadj, J.; Yatim, N.; Barnabei, L.; Corneau, A.; Boussier, J.; Pere, H.; Charbit, B.; Bondet, V.; Chenevier-Gobeaux, C.; Breillat, P.; Carlier, N.; Gauzit, R.; Morbieu, C.; Pene, F.; Marin, N.; Roche, N.; Szwebel, T.-A.; Smith, N.; Merkling, S.; Treluyer, J.-M.; Veyer, D.; Mouthon, L.; Blanc, C.; Tharaux, P.-L.; Rozenberg, F.; Fischer, A.; Duffy, D.; Rieux-Laucat, F.; Kerneis, S.; Terrier, B.",2020-04-23,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.19.20068015,1,Benjamin Terrier,"Department of Internal Medicine, National Referral Center for Rare Systemic Autoimmune Diseases, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris-Centre (APHP-CUP), Univer",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.19.20068015v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.19.20068015v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1126/science.abc6027
12945,Aerosol Generation from Different Wind Instruments,"The potential airborne transmission of COVID-19 has raised significant concerns regarding the safety of musical activities involving wind instruments. However, currently, there is a lack of systematic study and quantitative information of the aerosol generation during these instruments, which is crucial for offering risk assessment and the corresponding mitigation strategies for the reopening of these activities. Collaborating with 15 musicians from the Minnesota Orchestra, we conduct a systematic study of the aerosol generation from a large variety of wind instruments under different music dynamic levels and articulation patterns. We find that the aerosol concentration from different brass and woodwinds exhibits two orders of magnitude variation. Accordingly, we categorize the instruments into low (tuba), intermediate (bassoon, piccolo, flute, bass clarinet, French horn, and clarinet) and high risk (trumpet, bass trombone, and oboe) levels based on a comparison of their aerosol generation with those from normal breathing and speaking. In addition, we observe that the aerosol generation can be affected by the changing dynamic level, articulation pattern, the normal respiratory behaviors of individuals, and even the usage of some special techniques during the instrument play. However, such effects vary substantially for different types of instrument, depending on specific breathing techniques as well as the tube structure and inlet design of the instrument. Overall, our findings can bring insights into the risk assessment of airborne decrease transmission and the corresponding mitigation strategies for various musical activities involving wind instrument plays, including orchestras, community and worship bands, music classes, etc.","He, R.; Gao, L.; Trifonov, M.; Hong, J.",2020-09-07,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.03.20167833,3,Jiarong Hong,University of Minnesota,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.03.20167833v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.03.20167833v3.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.jaerosci.2020.105669
6017,Group testing for SARS-CoV-2 allows for up to 10-fold efficiency increase across realistic scenarios and testing strategies,"BackgroundDue to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, demand for diagnostic testing has increased drastically, resulting in shortages of necessary materials to conduct the tests and overwhelming the capacity of testing laboratories. The supply scarcity and capacity limits affect test administration: priority must be given to hospitalized patients and symptomatic individuals, which can prevent the identification of asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals and hence effective tracking and tracing policies. We describe optimized group testing strategies applicable to SARS-CoV-2 tests in scenarios tailored to the current COVID-19 pandemic and assess significant gains compared to individual testing.

MethodsWe account for biochemically realistic scenarios in the context of dilution effects on SARS-CoV-2 samples and consider evidence on specificity and sensitivity of PCR-based tests for the novel coronavirus. Because of the current uncertainty and the temporal and spatial changes in the prevalence regime, we provide analysis for a number of realistic scenarios and propose fast and reliable strategies for massive testing procedures.

FindingsWe find significant efficiency gaps between different group testing strategies in realistic scenarios for SARS-CoV-2 testing, highlighting the need for an informed decision of the pooling protocol depending on estimated prevalence, target specificity, and high-vs. low-risk population. For example, using one of the presented methods, all 1{middle dot}47 million inhabitants of Munich, Germany, could be tested using only around 141 thousand tests if the infection rate is below 0{middle dot}4% is assumed. Using 1 million tests, the 6{middle dot}69 million inhabitants from the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, could be tested as long as the infection rate does not exceed 1%.

InterpretationAltogether this work may help provide a basis for efficient upscaling of current testing procedures, taking the population heterogeneity into account and fine grained towards the desired study populations, e.g. cross-sectional versus health-care workers and adapted mixtures thereof.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe concept of group testing goes back to mathematical ideas developed in the 1940s and has already been successfully implemented for various infectious diseases but also in non-medical settings such as testing for failures of electronic components. The issue of group testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been addressed in a number of very recent papers and preprints including feasibility studies of different laboratories and a few methodological overview papers. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no study provided a comprehensive comparison contrasting hierarchical testing, array testing, and informative testing strategies based on combined groups for stratified populations and relying on up-to-date data about the accuracy of PCR-based test - all of them feasible to be implemented in the current pandemic. Moreover, a discussion of massive informative testing strategies for pandemic scenarios, employing combined pools consisting of high-risk and low-risk individuals, was still missing in the public health literature.

Added value of this studyWe analyse sensitivity, specificity, and throughput of group testing schemes in a series of scenarios tailored to realistic prevalence rates for SARS-CoV-2 in stratified populations and to the characteristics of the qRT-PCR tests used to diagnose COVID-19. Our analysis yields a comprehensive characterisation of a wide range of pooling schemes, broken down by population characteristics, that can serve as a guideline to be queried by testing entities to meet their settings. In particular, our findings demonstrate that a promising strategy to test asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals in conjunction with high-risk individuals such as healthcare workers is to amalgamate them together in a suitable way, and we provide adequate pool configurations. Such strategies had not been explored for SARS-CoV-2 testing as of yet. We also provide insights on group testing under constraints, i.e. when the number of stages, maximum group size and false negative rate of the whole method are restricted to a certain range of realistic values. We introduce efficient paralleliz-able non-adaptive test procedures for simplified and fast large-scale test design in case of severe shortage of test components. We develop an intuitive web application that can be used by any researcher working on the front line of testing procedures to visualize all the different strategies and to design pooling schemes in an flexible manner according to their specific prevalence scenario and test configuration.

Implications of all the available evidenceTesting for SARS-CoV-2 presents new challenges to authorities such as rapidly changing prevalence estimates and bottlenecks in testing capacity. In this context, applying an appropriately chosen group testing procedure can allow for up to 10-fold increase of the feasible throughput, such that the existing testing capacities can be used to test a significantly increased number of individuals. As a consequence, adequate tracing and quarantine strategies to reduce community transmission can be established and valuable epidemiological studies relying on accurate prevalence rates can be performed for the ongoing pandemic situation.","Verdun, C.

7108,Improved survival outcome in SARs-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome patients with Tocilizumab administration,"BackgroundThe novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARs-CoV-2), was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Hence, there is an urgency to find effective treatment. Of those patients afflicted in the United States, many have required treatment with ventilator secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Data are needed regarding the benefit of treatment and prevention of the cytokine storms in COVID-19 patients with Tocilizumab.

MethodsClinical outcomes data for patients admitted to Orange Regional Medical Center with confirmed COVID-19 from Mar 15, 2020 to Apr 20, 2020 were identified through electronic health record chart review. We conducted a retrospective case-control study in confirmed COVID 19 positive patients with ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation and compared outcome in terms of mortality and length of stay amongst those who received Tocilizumab as treatment modality opposed to those that did not.

ResultsA total of 94 patients with COVID-19 ARDS were analyzed. 44 were in the study group and 50 in the control group. We tried to match both group as close as possible in terms of age, sex, BMI and HS score-calculated using inflammatory markers-ferritin, triglycerides, AST and fibrinogen. The median age was 55.5 years in the study group and 66 in the control group, difference was not statistically significant. Average HS score was 114 in the Tocilizumab group and 92 in the control group, difference was statistically significant with P<0.0001. Also, the patients in the study group had elevated levels of IL-6, triglycerides, AST, ferritin which were statistically significant with p < 0.0001 when compared to the control group. Length of stay was longer, average 17.9 days in the Tocilizumab. Survival rate was much lower at 48 % in the control group and 61.36 % in patients who received Tocilizumab with significant P value of < 0.00001. The number needed to treat (NNT) was 7.48, if we treat 8 patients with Tocilizumab, 1 will not die.

ConclusionCytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) occurs in a large number of patients with severe COVID-19, which is also an important cause of death. IL-6 is the key molecule of CRS, so IL-6R antagonist Tocilizumab may be of value in improving outcomes. In our study Tocilizumab group seemed to have improved survival outcome. Results have to be interpreted with caution since this is a retrospective study and mortality is affected by multiple, confounding factors.

12737,A multi-centre prospective study of COVID-19 transmission following outpatient Gastrointestinal Endoscopy in the United Kingdom,"MessageThe COVID-19 pandemic has severely curtailed the practice of endoscopy (as an exemplar for outpatient diagnostic procedures) worldwide. Restart and recovery processes will be influenced by the need to protect patients and staff from disease transmission, but data on the risk of COVID-19 transmission after endoscopy are sparse. This is of particular importance in later pandemic phases when the risk of harm from delayed or missed significant diagnoses is likely to far outweigh the risk of infection. The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidance for restarting endoscopy included stratification of diagnostic procedures according to aerosol generation or assessment of infectious risk as well as pragmatic guidance on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). We sought to document the risk of COVID-19 transmission after endoscopy in this ""COVID-minimised"" environment. Prospective data were collected from 18 UK centres for n=6208 procedures, with follow-up telephone assessment of patients at 7 and 14 days. No cases of COVID-19 were documented by any centre after endoscopy in either patients or staff, with 3/2611 (0.11%) asymptomatic patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab testing pre-endoscopy. While these data cannot determine the relative contribution of each component of a COVID-minimised pathway, they provide clear support for such an approach, are reassuring and should aid planning for outpatient diagnostics in the COVID-19 recovery phase.","Hayee, B.; The Scots Project Group,  ; East, J.

11129,Optimally Pooled Viral Testing,"It has long been known that pooling samples may be used to minimize the total number of tests required in order to identify each infected individual in a population. Pooling is most advantageous in populations with low infection (positivity) rates, but is expected to remain better than non-pooled testing in populations with infection rates up to 30%. For populations with infection rates lower than 10%, additional testing efficiency may be realized by performing a second round of pooling to test all the samples in the positive first-round pools. The present predictions are validated by recent COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pooled testing and detection sensitivity measurements performed using non-optimal pool sizes, and quantify the additional improvement in testing efficiency that could have been obtained using optimal pooling. Although large pools are most advantageous for testing populations with very low infection rates, they are predicted to become highly non-optimal with increasing infection rate, while pool sizes smaller than 10 remain near-optimal over a broader range of infection rates.","Ben-Amotz, D.",2020-07-21,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.05.20145805,2,Dor Ben-Amotz,Purdue University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20145805v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20145805v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.epidem.2020.100413
3212,Efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19: results of a randomized clinical trial,"AimsStudies have indicated that chloroquine (CQ) shows antagonism against COVID-19 in vitro. However, evidence regarding its effects in patients is limited. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

Main methodsFrom February 4 to February 28, 2020, 62 patients suffering from COVID-19 were diagnosed and admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. All participants were randomized in a parallel-group trial, 31 patients were assigned to receive an additional 5-day HCQ (400 mg/d) treatment, Time to clinical recovery (TTCR), clinical characteristics, and radiological results were assessed at baseline and 5 days after treatment to evaluate the effect of HCQ.

Key findingsFor the 62 COVID-19 patients, 46.8% (29 of 62) were male and 53.2% (33 of 62) were female, the mean age was 44.7 (15.3) years. No difference in the age and sex distribution between the control group and the HCQ group. But for TTCR, the body temperature recovery time and the cough remission time were significantly shortened in the HCQ treatment group. Besides, a larger proportion of patients with improved pneumonia in the HCQ treatment group (80.6%, 25 of 31) compared with the control group (54.8%, 17 of 31). Notably, all 4 patients progressed to severe illness that occurred in the control group. However, there were 2 patients with mild adverse reactions in the HCQ treatment group. Significance: Among patients with COVID-19, the use of HCQ could significantly shorten TTCR and promote the absorption of pneumonia.

Initially, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 2.2 to 2.7. Here we provide a new estimate of this quantity. We collected extensive individual case reports and estimated key epidemiology parameters, including the incubation period. Integrating these estimates and high-resolution real-time human travel and infection data with mathematical models, we estimated that the number of infected individuals during early epidemic double every 2.4 days, and the R0 value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6. We further show that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus.

6407,Linear regression analysis of COVID-19 outbreak and control in Henan province caused by the output population from Wuhan,"ObjectivesTo observe outbreak of COVID-19 in Henan province caused by the output population from Wuhan, and high-grade control measures were proformed in Henan province, to study the phase of development and change of the epidemic in Henan province, and to make appropriate inferences about the influence of prevention and control measures and the phase of development of the epidemic.

MethodsLinear regression analysis were used to establish a linear regression model with the number of Wuhan roaming people as the dependent variable and the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in Henan province as the dependent variable, and to calculate and plot the regional distribution of the number of cases in 18 cities in Henan province in accordance with the criteria of whether the number of cases exceeded the expected number.

ResultsThere was a linear correlation between the number of people Wuhan roaming and the number of cases, and the linear regression model equation was statistically significant. The cities that exceeded the expected number of cases had a clear spatio-temporal distribution. Geographically, these cities were roughly in the 1 oclock and 2 oclock directions in Nanyang, and in terms of time period, the first phase (10 days), the cities that exceeded the expected number of cases changed almost daily. In the second phase (5 days), cities that exceeded the expected number of cases were moderated, and in the third phase (15 days), cities that exceeded the expected number of cases entered the stabilization phase.

ConclusionsThe priority cities for COVID-19 prevention and control in Henan province should pay special attention to the cities that have exceeded the expected number of COVID-19 cases, and the implementation of high-level control measures can effectively control the spread of COVID-19 within 2-4 weeks during the early stage of the epidemic.","Yuanyuan, C.",2020-05-08,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.03.20089193,1,Cheng Yuanyuan,Henan University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089193v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089193v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

5175,Association of infected probability of COVID-19 with ventilation rates in confined spaces: a Wells-Riley equation based investigation,"BackgroundA growing number of epidemiological cases are proving the possibility of airborne transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Ensuring adequate ventilation rate is essential to reduce the risk of infection in confined spaces.

MethodsWe obtained the quantum generation rate by a COVID-19 infector with a reproductive number based fitting approach, and then estimated the association between infected probability and ventilation rate with the Wells-Riley equation.

ResultsThe estimated quantum generation rate of COVID-19 is 14-48 /h. To ensure infected probabolity less than 1%, ventilation rate lareger than common values (100-350 m3/h and 1200-4000 m3/h for 15 minutes and 3 hours exposure, respectively) is required. If both the infector and susceptibles wear masks, the ventilation rate ensuring less than 1% infected probability is reduced to 50-180 m3/h and 600-2000 m3/h correspondingly, which is easier to be achieved by normal ventilation mode applied in some typical scenarios, including offices, classrooms, buses and aircraft cabins.

InterpretationThe risk of potential airborne transmission in confined spaces cannot be ignored. Strict preventive measures that have been widely adopted should be effective in reducing the risk of airborne transmitted infection.","Dai, H.; Zhao, B.",2020-04-24,Emergency Medicine,10.1101/2020.04.21.20072397,1,Bin Zhao,Tsinghua University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.21.20072397v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.21.20072397v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1007/s12273-020-0703-5
20556,Hidden Parameters impacting resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,"The spread of the COVID-19 virus has had an enormous impact on the worlds health and socioeconomic system. While lockdowns, which severely limit the movement of the population, have been implemented in March 2020 and again recently, the psychological and economic cost are severe. Removal of these restrictions occurred with varying degrees of success.

To study the resurgence of the virus in some communities we consider an epidemiological model, SIR-SD-L, that incorporates introduction of new population due to the removal of lockdown and identify parameters that impact the spread of the virus. This compartmental model of the epidemic incorporates a social distance metric based on progression of the infections; it models the dynamic propensity of infection spread based on the current infections relative to the susceptible population. The model is validated using data on growth of infections, hospitalizations and death, considering 24 counties in multiple US states and a categorization of the lockdown removal policies after the first lockdown. Model parameters, which include a compartment for the isolated population, are used to determine the rate at which the susceptible population increases to fit the rate of infections. Along with social distancing mandates, we identify active infections and the susceptible population as important factors in the resurgence of infections. We measure the efficacy of the lockdown removal policy via a ratio, PIR, which evaluates to less than 1 for counties where social distancing measures were mandated and which delayed complete re-opening of closed spaces like bars and restaurants. For other counties this ratio is greater than 1.

We also studied infection growth in the 24 US counties with respect to a release policy derived from CDC guidelines and compared against strategies that delay the removal of lockdown.

Our results illustrate that guidelines for deciding when lockdown rules are to be relaxed should consider the current state of the infectious population and the remaining susceptible population, hidden parameters that are deducible from models such as SIR-SD-L, and not limit policy considerations to the rate of new infections alone. This is especially true for counties where the growth rate of the virus is initially slow and misleading. Emphasis on social distancing is critical.","Zhang, Y.; Kapoor, S.",2021-01-20,Health Policy,10.1101/2021.01.15.20248217,1,Sanjiv Kapoor,Illinois Institute of Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.15.20248217v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.15.20248217v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
12342,Endpoint PCR Detection of Sars-CoV-2 RNA,"Quantitative real-time PCR methods have been used to perform approximately 278 million tests for COVID-19 up to mid-July 2020. Real-time PCR involves a rate limiting step where the samples are measured in situ during each PCR amplification cycle. This creates a bottleneck limiting scalability and as a consequence reducing access to inexpensive reliable testing at national and international scales. We investigated endpoint PCR for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 sequences on synthetic RNA standards and hospital patient samples. The endpoint PCR detection limit is constrained only by the stochastics of low copy numbers and reliably detected single copies of synthetic RNA standards. On a set of 30 patient samples, endpoint PCR found one additional positive sample and was able to confirm an indeterminate sample as negative. These results were found using 4 l reagent and 1 l of sample representing an 80% reduction in required RNA extract input and PCR reagent volumes relative to the NHS protocol (20 l reagent and 5 l sample). These results indicate that endpoint PCR should be the method of choice for large scale testing programmes. Based on the experience from ultra-high throughput genotyping efforts a single workflow using 384-well plates has similar PCR capacity (250 Million) to that required for all testing done worldwide during the first 7 month of the pandemic.","Moses, S.

Specifically, the death rates were higher in the population in poverty and communities of color across the United States. In the current study, we perform the secondary analysis of death rates due to COVID-19 data, obtained from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Results indicate that in the first phase of the pandemic (February 1 to August 1, 2020), counties with higher percentage of White, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders, and two or more races populations were found to have lower per-capita COVID-19 death rate. Whereas counties with population having higher percentage of females, Black or African American people, and persons in poverty had higher death rates. Analysis of the death rates from August 1 to September 10, 2020, indicate that disparity continues with counties having higher population of Black or African American people and female having higher death rates. Poverty is not a significant variable in determining the death rates due to COVID-19. Based on the current data and lack of detailed molecular mechanism of the disease, we suggest that more resources must be diverted to counties with higher percentages of Black or African American and female populations.","Urbine, E.; James, M.; Shah, V.",2020-11-28,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.11.24.20237818,1,Vishal Shah,West Chester University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.24.20237818v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.24.20237818v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

16570,COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies predict disease severity and survival,"COVID-19 exhibits variable symptom severity ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening, yet the relationship between severity and the humoral immune response is poorly understood. We examined antibody responses in 113 COVID-19 patients and found that severe cases resulting in intubation or death exhibited increased inflammatory markers, lymphopenia, and high anti-RBD antibody levels. While anti-RBD IgG levels generally correlated with neutralization titer, quantitation of neutralization potency revealed that high potency was a predictor of survival. In addition to neutralization of wild-type SARS-CoV-2, patient sera were also able to neutralize the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 mutant D614G, suggesting protection from reinfection by this strain. However, SARS-CoV-2 sera was unable to cross-neutralize a highly-homologous pre-emergent bat coronavirus, WIV1-CoV, that has not yet crossed the species barrier. These results highlight the importance of neutralizing humoral immunity on disease progression and the need to develop broadly protective interventions to prevent future coronavirus pandemics.","Garcia-Beltran, W.

6727,Age-stratified model of the COVID-19 epidemic to analyze the impact of relaxing lockdown measures: nowcasting and forecasting for Switzerland,"Compartmental models enable the analysis and prediction of an epidemic including the number of infected, hospitalized and deceased individuals in a population. They allow for computational case studies on non-pharmaceutical interventions thereby providing an important basis for policy makers. While research is ongoing on the transmission dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, it is important to come up with epidemic models that can describe the main stages of the progression of the associated COVID-19 respiratory disease. We propose an age-stratified discrete compartment model as an alternative to differential equation based S-I-R type of models. The model captures the highly age-dependent progression of COVID-19 and is able to describe the day-by-day advancement of an infected individual in a modern health care system. The fully-identified model for Switzerland not only predicts the overall histories of the number of infected, hospitalized and deceased, but also the corresponding age-distributions. The model-based analysis of the outbreak reveals an average infection fatality ratio of 0.4% with a pronounced maximum of 9.5% for those aged [&ge;]80 years. The predictions for different scenarios of relaxing the soft lockdown indicate a low risk of overloading the hospitals through a second wave of infections. However, there is a hidden risk of a significant increase in the total fatalities (by up to 200%) in case schools reopen with insufficient containment measures in place.","Balabdaoui, F.; Mohr, D.",2020-05-13,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.08.20095059,2,Dirk Mohr,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.08.20095059v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.08.20095059v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
4822,Prioritisation of potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug repurposing opportunities based on ability to achieve adequate target site concentrations derived from their established human pharmacokinetics,"There is a rapidly expanding literature on the in vitro antiviral activity of drugs that may be repurposed for therapy or chemoprophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. However, this has not been accompanied by a comprehensive evaluation of the ability of these drugs to achieve target plasma and lung concentrations following approved dosing in humans. Moreover, most publications have focussed on 50% maximum effective concentrations (EC50), which may be an insufficiently robust indicator of antiviral activity because of marked differences in the slope of the concentration-response curve between drugs. Accordingly, in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity data was digitised from all available publications up to 13th April 2020 and used to recalculate an EC90 value for each drug. EC90 values were then expressed as a ratio to the achievable maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) reported for each drug after administration of the approved dose to humans (Cmax/EC90 ratio). Only 14 of the 56 analysed drugs achieved a Cmax/EC90 ratio above 1 meaning that plasma Cmax concentrations exceeded those necessary to inhibit 90% of SARS-CoV-2 replication. A more in-depth assessment of the putative agents tested demonstrated that only nitazoxanide, nelfinavir, tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir) and sulfadoxine achieved plasma concentrations above their reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity across their entire approved dosing interval at their approved human dose. For all drugs reported, the unbound lung to plasma tissue partition coefficient (KpUlung) was also simulated and used along with reported Cmax and fraction unbound in plasma to derive a lung Cmax/EC50 as a better indicator of potential human efficacy (lung Cmax/EC90 ratio was also calculable for a limited number of drugs). Using this parameter hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, mefloquine, atazanavir (boosted with ritonavir), tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir), ivermectin, azithromycin and lopinavir (boosted with ritonavir) were all predicted to achieve lung concentrations over 10-fold higher than their reported EC50. This analysis was not possible for nelfinavir because insufficient data were available to calculate KpUlung but nitozoxanide and sulfadoxine were also predicted to exceed their reported EC50 by 3.1- and 1.5-fold in lung, respectively. The antiviral activity data reported to date have been acquired under different laboratory conditions across multiple groups, applying variable levels of stringency. However, this analysis may be used to select potential candidates for further clinical testing, while deprioritising compounds which are unlikely to attain target concentrations for antiviral activity. Future studies should focus on EC90 values and discuss findings in the context of achievable exposures in humans, especially within target compartments such as the lung, in order to maximise the potential for success of proposed human clinical trials.","Arshad, U.; Pertinez, H.; Box, H.; Tatham, L.; Rajoli, R.

15073,"Increased Self-Reported Discrimination and Concern for Physical Assault Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, and Filipino Americans","Objectives. To investigate self-reported discrimination and concern for physical assault due to the COVID-19 pandemic among disaggregated Asian subgroups in the US. Methods. We conducted a nationwide survey to assess self-reported discrimination and concern for physical assault due to COVID-19 across racial/ethnic groups, including diverse subgroups of Asians. Results. Chinese respondents experienced the largest change (15% increase) in proportion of respondents reporting discrimination from 2019 to 2020 (P<.01). Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Other API showed up to 3.9 times increased odds of self-reported racial/ethnic discrimination due to COVID-19 and, with the addition of Filipino, experienced up to 5.4 times increased odds of concern for physical assault due to COVID-19 compared to Whites. Conclusions. Our study is the first to examine self-reported discrimination and concern for physical assault due to COVID-19 in subgroups of Asian Americans, finding that East (Chinese, Korean, Japanese) and Southeast (Vietnamese, Filipino) Asian Americans have been disproportionately affected. Future studies should disaggregate Asian subgroups to fully understand experiences of discrimination in diverse populations in the US.","Ha, S. K.; Nguyen, A. T.; Sales, C.; Chang, R.

19755,Hydrating the Respiratory Tract: An Alternative Explanation Why Masks Lower Severity of COVID-19 Disease,"Seasonality of respiratory diseases has been linked, among other factors, to low outdoor absolute humidity and low relative humidity in indoor environments, which increase evaporation of water in the mucosal layer lining the respiratory tract. We demonstrate that normal breathing results in an absorption-desorption cycle inside facemasks, where super-saturated air is absorbed by the mask fibers during expiration, followed by evaporation during inspiration of dry environmental air. For double-layered cotton masks, which have considerable heat capacity, the temperature of inspired air rises above room temperature, and the effective increase in relative humidity can exceed 100%. We propose that the recently reported, disease-attenuating effect of generic facemasks is dominated by the strong humidity increase of inspired air.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTFacemasks are the most widely used tool for mitigating the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Decreased disease severity by the wearer has also been linked to the use of cloth facemasks. This well-documented finding is surprising considering that such masks are poor at filtering the smallest aerosol particles, which can reach the lower respiratory tract and have been associated with severe disease. We show that facemasks strongly increase the effective humidity of inhaled air, thereby promoting hydration of the respiratory epithelium which is known to be beneficial to the immune system. Increased humidity of inspired air could be an alternate explanation for the now well-established link between mask wearing and lower disease severity.","Bax, A.; Courtney, J.

5605,"Estimation of the actual incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in emergent hotspots: The example of Hokkaido, Japan during February-March 2020","Following the first report of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Sapporo City, Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan on 14 February 2020, a surge of cases was observed in Hokkaido during February and March. As of 6 March, 90 cases were diagnosed in Hokkaido. Unfortunately, many infected persons may not have been recognized as cases due to having mild or no symptoms. We therefore estimated the actual number of COVID-19 cases in (i) Hokkaido Prefecture and (ii) Sapporo City using data on cases diagnosed outside these areas. The estimated cumulative incidence in Hokkaido as of 27 February was 2297 cases (95% confidence interval [CI]: 382, 7091) based on data on travelers outbound from Hokkaido. The cumulative incidence in Sapporo City as of 28 February was estimated at 2233 cases (95% CI: 0, 4893) based on the count of confirmed cases within Hokkaido. Both approaches resulted in similar estimates, indicating higher incidence of infections in Hokkaido than were detected by the surveillance system. This quantification of the gap between detected and estimated cases can help inform public health response as it provides insight into the possible scope of undetected transmission.","Akhmetzhanov, A.

20604,Covid-19 respiratory protection: the filtration efficiency assessment of decontaminated FFP2 masks responding to associated shortages,"During the Covid-19 pandemic, healthcare workers were extremely vulnerable to infection with the virus and needed continuous protection. One of the most effective and widely used means of protection was the FFP2 respirator. Unfortunately, this crisis created a shortage of these masks, prompting hospitals to explore opportunities to reuse them after decontamination.

An approach for assessing the filtration efficiency of decontaminated FFP2 masks has been proposed and applied to evaluate the possibilities of their safe reuse. The decontamination processes adopted are those based on moist heat or hydrogen peroxide. The approach introduces efficiency measures that define the filtration and protection capacity of the masks, which characterize both chemical and structural changes, and encompasses many techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The test protocol was applied to mask samples that had endured different decontamination cycles and the results of their efficiency measures were compared to brand-new masks performances.

The main result was that chemical and structural characterization of the decontaminated masks have shown no substantial change or deformation of their filter media structures. Indeed, the respiratory resistance test has shown that the results of both the FFP2 masks that have undergone a hydrogen peroxide disinfection cycle or a steam autoclave cycle remained constant with a small variation of 10 Pa from the EN149 standard. The chemical characterization, on the other hand, has shown that the filter media of the decontaminated masks remains unchanged, with no detectable chemical derivatives in its constituents.","Moussa, B.; Omokhtar, B.; Hmami, F.; El Mabrouk, K.; El Alami, L.; Arhoune, B.; Belahcen, M.

19093,"The burden of active infection and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the general population: Results from a statewide survey in Karnataka, India","BackgroundGlobally, the routinely used case-based reporting and IgG serosurveys underestimate the actual prevalence of COVID-19. Simultaneous estimation of IgG antibodies and active SARS-CoV-2 markers can provide a more accurate estimation.

MethodsA cross-sectional survey of 16416 people covering all risk groups was done between 3-16 September 2020 using the state of Karnatakas infrastructure of 290 hospitals across all 30 districts. All participants were subjected to simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using a commercial ELISA kit, SARS-CoV-2 antigen using a rapid antigen detection test (RAT), and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for RNA detection. Maximum-likelihood estimation was used for joint estimation of the adjusted IgG, active, and total prevalence, while multinomial regression identified predictors.

FindingsThe overall adjusted prevalence of COVID-19 in Karnataka was 27 {middle dot}3% (95% CI: 25 {middle dot}7-28 {middle dot}9), including IgG 16 {middle dot}4% (95% CI: 15 {middle dot}1 - 17 {middle dot}7) and active infection 12 {middle dot}7% (95% CI: 11 {middle dot}5-13 {middle dot}9). The case-to-infection ratio was 1:40, and the infection fatality rate was 0 {middle dot}05%. Influenza-like symptoms or contact with a COVID-19 positive patient are good predictors of active infection. The RAT kits had higher sensitivity (68%) in symptomatic participants compared to 47% in asymptomatic.

InterpretationThis is the first comprehensive survey providing accurate estimates of the COVID-19 burden anywhere in the world. Further, our findings provide a reasonable approximation of population immunity threshold levels. Using the RAT kits and following the syndromic approach can be useful in screening and monitoring COVID-19. Leveraging existing surveillance platforms, coupled with appropriate methods and sampling framework, renders our model replicable in other settings.","Babu, G.

2402,A retrospective study of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection in 26 children,"BackgroundThe outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in China began in December 2019. Studies on novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were less based on pediatric patients. This study aimed to reveal the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children.

MethodThis study retrospectively analyzed the clinical symptoms, laboratory results, chest CT, and treatment of children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19(ie, with samples that were positive for 2019 novel coronavirus[2019-nCoV]) who were admitted to Shenzhen Center of National Infectious Disease Clinical Medical Research from January 16 to February 8, 2020.

ResultNine patients had no obvious clinical symptom. 11 patients developed fever. Other symptoms, including cough(in eleven of seventeen patients), rhinorrhea(in two), diarrhea(in two), vomiting(in two), were also observed. A small minority of patients had lymphocytopenia. Alanine transaminase or transaminase increased in three cases. According to chest CT scan, 11 patients showed unilateral pneumonia, 8 patients had no pulmonary infiltration. No serious complications such as acute respiratory syndrome and acute lung injury occurred in all patients.

10959,Foundational research and NIH funding enabling Emergency Use Authorization of remdesivir for COVID-19,"Emergency Use Authorization for remdesivir months after discovery of COVID-19 is unprecedented. Typically, decades of research and public-sector funding are required to establish the mature body of foundational research requisite for efficient, targeted drug discovery and development. This work quantifies the body of research related to remdesivirs biological target, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), or parent chemical structure, nucleoside analogs (NcAn), through 2019, as well as NIH funding for this research 2000-2019. There were 6,567 RdRp-related publications in PubMed, including 1,263 with NIH support, and 11,073 NcAn-related publications, including 2,319 with NIH support. NIH support for RdRp research comprised 2,203 Project Years with Costs of $1,875 million. NIH support for NcAn research comprised 4,607 Project Years with Costs of $4,612 million. Research Project grants accounted for 63% and 48% of Project Years for RdRp and NcAn respectively, but only 19% and 12% of Project Costs. Analytical modeling of research maturation estimates that RdRp and NcAn research passed an established maturity threshold in 2008 and 1994 respectively. Of 97 investigational compounds targeting RdRp since 1989, the three authorized for use entered clinical trials after both thresholds. This work demonstrates the scale of foundational research on the biological target and parent chemical structure of remdesivir that supported its discovery and development for COVID-19. This work identifies $6.5 billion in NIH funding for research leading to remdesivir, underscoring the role of public sector investments in basic research and research infrastructure that underlie new drugs and the response to emergent disease.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTEmergency Use Authorization of remdesivir for treating COVID-19 four months after discovery of this virus was enabled by decades of research on the drugs biological target as well as other medicines with related chemical structures. The NIH contributed 6,800 years of grant funding to this research, totaling $6.5 billion (2000-2019), including funding for both investigator-initiated research and research infrastructure. Of this, $46.5 million was for research directly related to remdesivir. This analysis demonstrates the importance of a robust body of foundational research in responding rapidly to emergent diseases, and the substantial NIH contribution to this research. It also underscores the scale and significance of the public-sector investments that enable new drug discovery and development.","Cleary, E. G.; Jackson, M. J.; Folchman-Wagner, Z.; Ledley, F.

20223,The importance of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the COVID-19 vaccine rollout,"The promise of efficacious vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is fulfilled and vaccination campaigns are starting worldwide. However, the fight against the pandemic is far from over. Here, we propose an age-structured compartmental model to study the interplay of disease transmission, vaccines rollout, and behavioural dynamics. We investigate, via in-silico simulations, individual and societal behavioural changes, possibly induced by the start of the vaccination campaigns, and manifested as a relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. We calibrate the model using real epidemiological data for three different countries: Italy, France, and the United Kingdom. We explore different vaccination rollout speeds, prioritization strategies, and vaccine efficacy as well as multiple behavioural responses. Our findings suggest that early relaxation of safe behaviours can jeopardize the benefits brought by the vaccine in the short term: a fast vaccine distribution and policies aimed at keeping high compliance of individual safe behaviours are key to mitigate disease resurgence.","Gozzi, N.; Bajardi, P.; Perra, N.",2021-01-09,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.01.09.21249480,1,Paolo Bajardi,ISI Foundation,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.09.21249480v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.09.21249480v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
19816,Salivary SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid detection: a prospective cohort study,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 quick testing and reporting are now considered relevant for the containment of new pandemic waves. Antigen testing in self-collected saliva might be useful. We compared the diagnostic performance of salivary and naso-pharyngeal swab (NPS) SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection by a rapid chemiluminescent assay (CLEIA) and two different point-of-care (POC) immunochromatographic assays, with that of molecular testing.

Methods234 patients were prospectively enrolled. Paired self-collected saliva (Salivette) and NPS were obtained to perform rRT-PCR, chemiluminescent (Lumipulse G) and POC (NPS: Fujirebio and Abbott; saliva: Fujirebio) for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection.

ResultsThe overall agreement between NPS and saliva rRT-PCR was 78.7%, reaching 91.7% at the first week from symptoms onset. SARS-CoV-2 CLEIA antigen was highly accurate in distinguishing between positive and negative NPS (ROC-AUC=0.939, 95%CI:0.903-0.977), with 81.6% sensitivity and 93.8% specificity. This assay on saliva had an overall good accuracy (ROC-AUC=0.805, 95%CI:0.740-0.870), reaching the optimal value within 7 days from symptom onset (Sensitivity: 72%; Specificity: 97%). POC antigen in saliva had a very limited sensitivity (13%), performing better in NPS (Sensitivity: 48% and 66%; Specificity: 100% and 99% for Espline and Abbott respectively), depending on viral loads.

ConclusionsSelf-collected saliva is a valid alternative to NPS for SARS-CoV-2 detection not only by molecular, but also by CLEIA antigen testing, for which the highest diagnostic accuracy was achieved in the first week from symptom onset. Saliva is not suitable for POC, although the accuracy of these tests appears satisfactory for NPS with high viral load.","Basso, D.; Aita, A.; Padoan, A.; Cosma, C.; Navaglia, F.; Moz, S.; Contran, N.; Zambon, C.-F.; Cattelan, A.

16795,Superspreading Events Without Superspreaders: Using High Attack Rate Events to Estimate N o forAirborne Transmission of COVID-19,"We study transmission of COVID-19 using five well-documented case studies - a Washington state church choir, a Korean call center, a Korean exercise class, and two different Chinese bus trips. In all cases the likely index patients were pre-symptomatic or mildly symptomatic, which is when infective patients are most likely to interact with large groups of people. An estimate of N0, the characteristic number of COVID-19 virions needed to induce infection in each case, is found using a simple physical model of airborne transmission. We find that the N0 values are similar for five COVID-19 superspreading cases ([~]300-2,000 viral copies) and of the same order as influenza A. Consistent with the recent results of Goyal et al, these results suggest that viral loads relevant to infection from presymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals may fall into a narrow range, and that exceptionally high viral loads are not required to induce a superspreading event [1,2]. Rather, the accumulation of infective aerosols exhaled by a typical pre-symptomatic or mildly symptomatic patient in a confined, crowded space (amplified by poor ventilation, particularly activity like exercise or singing, or lack of masks) for exposure times as short as one hour are sufficient. We calculate that talking and breathing release [~]460N0 and [~]10N0 (quanta)/hour, respectively, providing a basis to estimate the risks of everyday activities. Finally, we provide a calculation which motivates the observation that fomites appear to account for a small percentage of total COVID-19 infection events.","Prentiss, M. G.; Chu, A.; Berggren, K.

16258,Rapid and Low-cost Sampling for Detection of Airborne SARS-CoV-2 in Dehumidifier Condensate,"Airborne spread of COVID-19 by infectious aerosol is all but certain. However, easily implemented approaches to assess the actual environmental threat are currently unavailable. We present a simple approach with the potential to rapidly provide information about the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the atmosphere at any location. We used a portable dehumidifier as a readily available and affordable tool to collect airborne virus in the condensate. The dehumidifiers were deployed in selected locations of a hospital ward with patients reporting flu like symptoms which could possibly be due to COVID-19 over three separate periods of one week. Samples were analyzed frequently for both virus envelope protein and SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In several samples across separate deployments, condensate from dehumidifiers tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens and confirmed using two independent assays. RNA was detected, but not attributable to SARS-CoV-2. Our results point to a facile pool testing method to sample air in any location in the world and assess the presence and concentration of the infectious agent in order to obtain quantitative risk assessment of exposure, designate zones as  hot spots and minimize the need for individual testing which may often be time consuming, expensive and laborious.","Moitra, P.; Alafeef, M.; Dighe, K.; Ray, P.; Chang, J.; Ramamurthy, S.

8286,Mental health outcomes and associations during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey of the US general population,"Pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may lead to significant mental health stresses, potentially with modifiable risk factors. To determine the presence of and magnitude of associations between baseline associations and anxiety and depression in the US general population, we performed an internet-based cross-sectional survey of an age-, sex-, and race-stratified representative sample from the US general population. Degrees of anxiety, depression, and loneliness were assessed using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the 8-item UCLA Loneliness Scale, respectively. Unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations with baseline demographic characteristics. A total of 1,005 finished surveys were returned of the 1,020 started, yielding a completion rate of 98.5% in the survey panel. The mean (SD) age of respondents was 45 (16), and 494 (48.8%) were male. Baseline demographic data were similar between those that were (n=663, 66.2%) and were not (n=339, 33.8%) under a shelter in place/ stay at home order, with the exception of sex and geographic location. Overall, 264 subjects (26.8%) met criteria for an anxiety disorder based on a GAD-7 cutoff of 10; a cutoff of 7 yielded 416 subjects (41.4%) meeting clinical criteria for anxiety. On multivariable analysis, male sex (OR 0.65, 95% CI [0.49, 0.87]) and living in a larger home (OR 0.46, 95% CI [0.24, 0.88]) were associated with a decreased odds of meeting anxiety criteria. Rural location (OR 1.39, 95% CI [1.03, 1.89]), loneliness (OR 4.92, 95% CI [3.18, 7.62]), and history of hospitalization (OR 2.04, 95% CI [1.38, 3.03]), were associated with increased odds of meeting anxiety criteria. 232 subjects (23.6%) met criteria for clinical depression. On multivariable analysis, male sex (OR 0.71, 95% CI [0.53, 0.95]), increased time outdoors (OR 0.51, 95% CI [0.29, 0.92]), and living in a larger home (OR 0.35, 95% CI [0.18, 0.69]), were associated with decreased odds of meeting depression criteria. Having lost a job (OR 1.64, 95% CI [1.05, 2.54]), loneliness (OR 10.42, 95% CI [6.26, 17.36]), and history of hospitalization (OR 2.42, 95% CI [1.62, 3.62]), were associated with an increased odds of meeting depression criteria. Income, media consumption, and religiosity were not associated with mental health outcomes. Anxiety and depression are common in the US general population in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and are associated with potentially modifiable factors.","Kantor, B.

11183,IL-33 expression in response to SARS-CoV-2 correlates with seropositivity in COVID-19 convalescent individuals,"Our understanding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still developing. We investigated seroprevalence and immune responses in subjects professionally exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and their family members (155 individuals; ages 5-79 years). Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein aligned with PCR results that confirmed previous infection. Anti-spike IgG titers remained high 60 days post-infection and did not associate with symptoms, but spike-specific IgM did associate with malaise and fever. We found limited household transmission, with children of infected individuals seldomly seropositive, highlighting professional exposure as the dominant route of infection in our cohort. We analyzed PBMCs from a subset of seropositive and seronegative adults. TLR7 agonist-activation revealed an increased population of IL-6+TNF-IL-1{beta}+ monocytes, while SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation elicited IL-33, IL-6, IFNa2, and IL-23 expression in seropositive individuals. IL-33 correlated with CD4+ T cell activation in PBMCs from convalescent subjects, and was likely due to T cell-mediated effects on IL-33-producing cells. IL-33 is associated with pulmonary infection and chronic diseases like asthma and COPD, but its role in COVID-19 is unknown. Analysis of published scRNAseq data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with mild to severe COVID-19 revealed a population of IL-33-producing cells that increases with disease. Together these findings show that IL-33 production is linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection and warrant further investigation of IL-33 in COVID-19 pathogenesis and immunity.","Stanczak, M. A.; Sanin, D.

9626,ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF TRANSMISSION DURING PROLONGED VIRAL SHEDDING ON THE EFFECT OF LOCKDOWN RELAXATION ON COVID-19,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWA key parameter in epidemiological modeling which characterizes the spread of an infectious disease is the mean serial interval. There is increasing evidence supporting a prolonged viral shedding window for COVID-19, but the transmissibility in this phase is unclear. Based on this, we build a model including an additional compartment of infectious individuals who stay infectious for a longer duration than the reported serial interval, but with infectivity reduced to varying degrees. We find that such an assumption also yields a plausible model in explaining the data observed so far, but has different implications for the future predictions in case of a gradual easing on the lockdown measures. Considering the role of modeling in important decisions such as easing lockdown measures and adjusting hospital capacity, we believe that it is critically important to consider a chronically infectious population as an alternative modeling approach to better interpret the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.","Tepekule, B.; Hauser, A.; Kachalov, V.

11881,Learning the Mental Health Impact of COVID-19 in the United States with Explainable Artificial Intelligence,"ImportanceCOVID-19 pandemic has deeply affected the health, economic, and social fabric of nations. Identification of individual-level susceptibility factors may help people in identifying and managing their emotional, psychological, and social well-being.

ObjectiveThis work is focused on learning a ranked list of factors that could indicate a predisposition to a mental disorder during the COVID pandemic.

Data Sources and Study designIn this study, We have used a survey of 17764 adults in the USA at different age groups, genders, and socioeconomic statuses.

MethodsThrough initial statistical analysis followed by Bayesian Network inference, we have identified key factors affecting Mental health during the COVID pandemic. Integrating Bayesian networks with classical machine learning approaches lead to effective modeling of the level of mental health.

ResultsOverall, females are more stressed than males, and people of age-group 18-29 are more vulnerable to anxiety than other age groups. Using the Bayesian Network Model, we found that people with chronic medical condition of mental illness are more prone to mental disorders during the COVID age. The new realities of working from home, home-schooling, and lack of communication with family/friends/neighbors induces mental pressure. Financial assistance from social security helps in reducing mental stress during COVID generated economic crises. Finally, using supervised ML models, we predicted the most mentally vulnerable people with ~80% accuracy.

QuestionWhat factors could affect mental health, and how could this level be predicted using the same factors during the of COVID-19?

FindingIn this survey-data based study, multiple factors such as Social isolation, digital communication, working, and schooling from home, were identified as crucial factors of mental illness during Covid-19. Interestingly, behavioral changes such as wearing a mask and avoiding restaurants and public places were not found to be associated with mental health.

MeaningRegular non-virtual communication with friends and family, healthy social life and social security are key factors and especially taking care of people with mental disease history is even more important.","Jha, I.

14966,The impact of COVID-19 in diabetic kidney disease and chronic kidney disease: A population-based study,"Background: The spectrum of pre-existing renal disease is known as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes. However, little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on patients with diabetic nephropathy in comparison to patients with chronic kidney disease. Methods: We used the Mexican Open Registry of COVID-19 patients 11 to analyze anonymized records of those who had symptoms related to COVID-19 to analyze the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 pneumonia, admission, intubation, Intensive Care Unit admission and mortality. Robust Poisson regression was used to relate sex and age to each of the six outcomes and find adjusted prevalences and adjusted prevalence ratios. Also, binomial regression models were performed for those outcomes that had significant results to generate probability plots to perform a fine analysis of the results obtained along age as a continuous variable. Results: The adjusted prevalence analysis revealed that that there was a a 87.9% excess probability of developing COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with diabetic nephropathy, a 5% excess probability of being admitted, a 101.7% excess probability of intubation and a 20.8% excess probability of a fatal outcome due to COVID-19 pneumonia in comparison to CKD patients (p<0.01). Conclusions: Patients with diabetic nephropathy had nearly a twofold rate of COVID-19 pneumonia, a higher probability of admission, a twofold probability of intubation and a higher chance of death once admitted compared to patients with chronic kidney disease alone. Also, both diseases had higher COVID-19 pneumonia rates, intubation rates and case-fatality rates compared to the overall population.

13367,Genomic Diversity of SARS-CoV-2 During Early Introduction into the United States National Capital Region,"BackgroundThe early COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by rapid global spread. In the United States National Capital Region, over 2,000 cases were reported within three weeks of its first detection in March 2020. We aimed to use genomic sequencing to understand the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the region. By correlating genetic information to disease phenotype, we also aimed to gain insight into any correlation between viral genotype and case severity or transmissibility.

MethodsWe performed whole genome sequencing of clinical SARS-CoV-2 samples collected in March 2020 by the Johns Hopkins Health System. We analyzed these regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes alongside detailed clinical metadata and the global phylogeny to understand early establishment of the virus within the region.

ResultsWe analyzed 620 samples from the Johns Hopkins Health System collected between March 11-31, 2020, comprising 37.3% of the total cases in Maryland during this period. We selected 143 of these samples for sequencing, generating 114 complete viral genomes. These genomes belong to all five major Nextstrain-defined clades, suggesting multiple introductions into the region and underscoring the diversity of the regional epidemic. We also found that clinically severe cases had genomes belonging to all of these clades.

ConclusionsWe established a pipeline for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing within the Johns Hopkins Health system, which enabled us to capture the significant viral diversity present in the region as early as March 2020. Efforts to control local spread of the virus were likely confounded by the number of introductions into the region early in the epidemic and interconnectedness of the region as a whole.","Thielen, P.

2373,Sensitive one-step isothermal detection of pathogen-derived RNAs,"The recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) require fast, simple, and sensitive onsite nucleic acid diagnostics that can be developed rapidly to prevent the spread of diseases. We have developed a SENsitive Splint-based one-step isothermal RNA detection (SENSR) method for rapid and straightforward onsite detection of pathogen RNAs with high sensitivity and specificity. SENSR consists of two simple enzymatic reactions: a ligation reaction by SplintR ligase and subsequent transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. The resulting transcript forms an RNA aptamer that induces fluorescence. Here, we demonstrate that SENSR is an effective and highly sensitive method for the detection of the current epidemic pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We also show that the platform can be extended to the detection of five other pathogens. Overall, SENSR is a molecular diagnostic method that can be developed rapidly for onsite uses requiring high sensitivity, specificity, and short assaying times.","Woo, C.

19054,SARS Coronavirus-2 microneutralisation and commercial serological assays correlated closely for some but not all enzyme immunoassays,"BackgroundSerological testing for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies provides important research and diagnostic information relating to COVID-19 prevalence, incidence, and host immune response. A greater understanding of the relationship between functionally neutralising antibodies detected using microneutralisation assays and binding antibodies detected using scalable enzyme immunoassays (EIA) is needed in order to address protective immunity post-infection or vaccination, and assess EIA suitability as a surrogate test for screening of convalescent plasma donors. We assessed whether neutralising antibody titres correlated with signal cut-off ratios in five commercially available EIAs, and one in-house assay based on expressed spike protein targets.

MethodsSera from individuals recovered from patients or convalescent plasma donors who reported laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=200), and negative control sera collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (n=100) were assessed in parallel. Performance was assessed by calculating EIA sensitivity and specificity with reference to microneutralisation.

ResultsNeutralising antibodies were detected in 166 (83%) samples. Compared with this, the most sensitive EIAs were the Cobas Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (98%) and Vitros Immunodiagnostic Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (100%), which detect total antibody targeting the N and S1 antigens, respectively. The assay with the best quantitative relationship with microneutralisation was the Euroimmun IgG.

ConclusionsThese results suggest the marker used (total Ab vs IgG vs IgA), and the target antigen are important determinants of assay performance. The strong correlation between microneutralisation and some commercially available assays demonstrate their potential for clinical and research use in assessing protection following infection or vaccination, and use as a surrogate test to assess donor suitability for convalescent plasma donation.","Walker, G.

8168,COVID-19 impact on consecutive neurological patients admitted to the emergency department,"ObjectiveAim of this study was to analyse the impact of COVID-19 on clinical and laboratory findings and outcome of neurological patients consecutively admitted to the emergency department (ED) of a tertiary hub center.

MethodsAll adult patients consecutively admitted to the ED for neurological manifestations from February 20th through April 30th 2020 at Spedali Civili of Brescia entered the study. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were extracted from medical records and compared between patients with and without COVID-19.

ResultsOut of 505 consecutively patients evaluated at ED with neurological symptoms, 147 (29.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. These patients displayed at triage higher values of CRP, AST, ALT, and fibrinogen but not lymphopenia (p<0.05). They were older (73.1 {+/-} 12.4 vs 65.1 {+/-} 18.9 years, p=0.001) had higher frequency of stroke (34.7% vs 29.3%), encephalitis/meningitis (9.5% vs 1.9%) and delirium (16.3% vs 5.0%). Compared to patients without COVID, they were more frequently hospitalized (91.2% vs 69.3%, p<0.0001) and showed higher mortality rates (29.7% vs 1.8%, p<0.0.001) and discharge disability, independently from age.

ConclusionsCOVID-19 impacts on clinical presentation of neurological disorders, with higher frequency of stroke, encephalitis and delirium, and was strongly associated with increased hospitalisation, mortality and disability.","Pilotto, A.; Benussi, A.; Libri, I.; Masciocchi, S.; Poli, L.; Premi, E.; Alberici, A.; Baldelli, E.; Bonacina, S.; Brambilla, L.; Benini, M.; Caratozzolo, S.; Cortinovis, M.; Costa, A.; Cotti Piccinelli, S.; Cottini, E.; Cristillo, V.; Delrio, I.; Filosto, M.; Gamba, M.; Gazzina, S.; Gilberti, N.; Gipponi, S.; Giunta, M.; Imarisio, A.; Liberini, P.; Locatelli, M.; Schiano Di Cola, F.; Rao, R.; Risi, B.; Rozzini, L.; Scalvini, A.; Vergani, V.; Volonghi, I.; Zoppi, N.; Borroni, B.; Magoni, M.; Leonardi, M.; Zanusso, G.; Ferrari, S.; Mariotto, S.; Pezzini, A.; Gasparotti, R.; Paolillo, C.; Padov",2020-05-26,Neurology,10.1101/2020.05.23.20110650,1,Alessandro Padovani,University of Brescia,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.23.20110650v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.23.20110650v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1136/jnnp-2020-323929
19057,"SARS-CoV-2 infections in kindergartens and associated households at the start of the second wave in Berlin, Germany - a cross sectional study","ObjectivesThe comparatively large proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in the youngest children opens up the possibility that kindergartens represent reservoirs of infection. However, actual surveys in kindergartens beyond individual outbreaks are rare. At the beginning of the second pandemic wave in Berlin, Germany, i.e., end of September 2020, we screened SARS-CoV-2 infections among kindergarten children, staff and connected household members.

MethodsTwelve kindergartens were randomly selected in the Berlin metropolitan area, and a total of 720 participants were recruited (155 pre-school children, 78 staff, 487 household members). Participants were briefly examined and interviewed, and SARS-CoV-2 infections and anti-SARS-Cov-2 IgG antibodies were assessed.

ResultsSigns and symptoms, largely resembling common cold, were present in 24.2% of children and 28.9% of staff. However, no SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected among 701 PCR-tested individuals, and only one childcare worker showed IgG seroreactivity (0.15%; 1/672).

ConclusionsAgainst a backdrop of increased pandemic activity in the community, this cross-sectional study does not suggest that kindergartens are silent transmission reservoirs. Nevertheless, at increasing pandemic activity, reinforced precautionary measures and repeated routine testing appears advisable.","Thielecke, M.; Theuring, S.; Van Loon, W.; Hommes, F.; Mall, M.

12571,Estrogen and COVID-19 symptoms: associations in women from the COVID Symptom Study,"BackgroundMen and older women have been shown to be at higher risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Animal model studies of SARS-CoV and MERS suggest that the age and sex difference in COVID-19 symptom severity may be due to a protective effect of the female sex hormone estrogen. Females have shown an ability to mount a stronger immune response to a variety of viral infections because of more robust humoral and cellular immune responses.

ObjectivesWe sought to determine whether COVID-19 positivity increases in women entering menopause. We also aimed to identify whether premenopausal women taking exogenous hormones in the form of the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) and post-menopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have lower predicted rates of COVID-19, using our published symptom-based model.

DesignThe COVID Symptom Study developed by Kings College London and Zoe Global Limited was launched in the UK on 24th March 2020. It captured self-reported information related to COVID-19 symptoms. Data used for this study included records collected between 7th May - 15th June 2020.

Main outcome measuresWe investigated links between COVID-19 rates and 1) menopausal status, 2) COCP use and 3) HRT use, using symptom-based predicted COVID-19, tested COVID-19, and disease severity based on requirement for hospital attendance or respiratory support.

ParticipantsFemale users of the COVID Symptom Tracker Application in the UK, including 152,637 women for menopause status, 295,689 for COCP use, and 151,193 for HRT use. Analyses were adjusted for age, smoking and BMI.

ResultsPost-menopausal women aged 40-60 years had a higher rate of predicted COVID (P=0.003) and a corresponding range of symptoms, with consistent, but not significant trends observed for tested COVID-19 and disease severity. Women aged 18-45 years taking COCP had a significantly lower predicted COVID-19 (P=8.03E-05), with a reduction in hospital attendance (P=0.023). Post-menopausal women using HRT or hormonal therapies did not exhibit consistent associations, including increased rates of predicted COVID-19 (P=2.22E-05) for HRT users alone.

ConclusionsOur findings support a protective effect of estrogen on COVID-19, based on positive association between predicted COVID-19 and menopausal status, and a negative association with COCP use. HRT use was positively associated with COVID-19 symptoms; however, the results should be considered with caution due to lack of data on HRT type, route of administration, duration of treatment, and potential comorbidities.

9438,Successful contact tracing systems for COVID-19 rely on effective quarantine and isolation,"BackgroundTest, trace and isolate are the three crucial components of the response to COVID-19 identified by the World Health Organisation. Mathematical models of contact tracing often over-simplify the ability of traced contacts to quarantine or isolate.

MethodWe use an age-structured branching process model of individual disease transmission combined with a detailed model of symptom onset, testing, contact quarantine and case isolation to model each aspect of the test, trace, isolate strategy. We estimated the effective reproduction number under a range of scenarios to understand the importance of each aspect of the system.

FindingsPeoples ability to quarantine and isolate effectively is a crucial component of a successful contact tracing system. 80% of cases need to be quarantined or isolated within 4 days of quarantine or isolation of index case to be confident the contact tracing system is effective.

InterpretationProvision of universal support systems to enable people to quarantine and isolate effectively, coupled with investment in trained public health professionals to undertake contact tracing, are crucial to success. We predict that a high-quality, rapid contact tracing system with strong support structures in place, combined with moderate social distancing measures, is required to contain the spread of COVID-19.

Evidence before this studyExisting models of contact tracing concentrate on the time taken to trace contacts and the proportion of contacts who are traced, often focussing on the differences between manual and digital tracing. They often over-simplify the quarantine and isolation aspect of contact tracing. For example, some models assume that isolation and quarantine are 100% effective in preventing further transmission, while others treat tracing coverage and isolation effectiveness as interchangeable. Numerous performance indicators have been used to measure the effectiveness of a contact tracing system. However, it is frequently not known how reliably these indicators measure the reduction in in onward transmission under a range of unknown parameters.

Added value of this studyWe explicitly model the effectiveness of contact quarantine and case isolation in reducing onward transmission and show that these are not equivalent to tracing coverage. For example, isolating 50% of contacts with 100% effectiveness gives a much larger reduction in onward transmission than isolating all contacts but with only 50% effectiveness. We show that, although tracing speed is important, without effective isolation and quarantine it is a waste of effort. We show that seemingly straightforward indicators of contact tracing effectiveness are unreliable when the effectiveness of isolation is not guaranteed. We propose an indicator based on the time between quarantine or isolation of an index case and quarantine or isolation of secondary cases that is more robust to unknowns.

Implications of all the available evidenceEstablishing support systems to enable individuals to quarantine and isolate effectively is equally important as implementing a fast and efficient contact tracing system. Effective contact tracing requires a skilled, professional workforce that can trace downstream contacts of a positive case, as well as upstream contacts to determine the source of infection and provide the high quality data needed. Over-reliance on digital contact tracing solutions or the use of untrained contact tracing staff are likely to lead to less favourable outcomes.","James, A.; Plank, M. J.; Binny, R.

6427,Multivariate Prediction Network Model for epidemic progression to study the effects of lockdown time and coverage on a closed community on theoretical and real scenarios of COVID-19.,"The aim of this study was to develop a realistic network model to predict the relationship between lockdown duration and coverage in controlling the progression of the incidence curve of an epidemic with the characteristics of COVID-19 in two scenarios (1) a closed and non-immune population, and (2) a real scenario from State of Rio de Janeiro from May 6th 2020.

Effects of lockdown time and rate on the progression of an epidemic incidence curve in a virtual population of 10 thousand subjects. Predictor variables were reproductive values established in the most recent literature (R0 =2.7 and 5.7, and Re = 1.28 from Rio de Janeiro State at May 6th), without lockdown and with coverages of 25%, 50%, and 90% for 21, 35, 70, and 140 days in up to 13 different scenarios for each R0/Re, where individuals remained infected and transmitters for 14 days. We estimated model validity in theoretical and real scenarios respectively by applying an exponential model on the incidence curve with no lockdown with growth rate coefficient observed in realistic scenarios, and (2) fitting real data series from RJ upon simulated data, respectively.

For R0=5.7, the flattening of the curve occurs only with long lockdown periods (70 and 140 days) with a 90% coverage. For R0=2.7, coverages of 25 and 50% also result in curve flattening and reduction of total cases, provided they occur for a long period (70 days or more). For realistic scenario in Rio de Janeiro, lockdowns +25% or more from May 6th during 140 days showed expressive flattening and number of COVID cases two to five times lower. If a more intense coverage lockdown (about +25 to +50% as much as the current one) will be implemented until June 6th during at least 70 days, it is still possible reduce nearly 40-50% the impact of pandemy in state of Rio de Janeiro.

These data corroborate the importance of lockdown duration regardless of virus transmission and sometimes of intensity of coverage, either in realistic or theoretical scenarios of COVID-10 epidemics. Even later, the improvement of lockdown coverage can be effective to minimize the impact of epidemic.","Abramov, D. M.; Gomes Junior, S.

2592,Clinical characteristics and durations of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Beijing: a retrospective cohort study,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is still becoming an increasing global threat to public health. More detailed and specific characteristics of COVID-19 are needed to better understand this disease. Additionally, durations of COVID-19, e.g., the average time from exposure to recovery, which is of great value in understanding this disease, has not been reported so far.

AimsTo give the information on clinical characteristics and different durations of COVID-19 and to identify the potential risk factors for longer hospitalization duration.

MethodsIn this retrospective study, we enrolled 77 patients (mean age: 52{+/-}20 years; 44.2% males) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Beijing YouAn Hospital during 21st Jan and 8th February 2020. Epidemiological, clinical and radiological data on admission were collected; complications and outcomes were followed up until 29th February 2020. The studys endpoint was the discharge within two weeks. Cox proportional-hazards regression was performed to identify risk factors for longer hospitalization duration.

ResultsOf 77 patients, there are 34 (44.2%) males, 24 (31.2%) with comorbidities, 22 (28.6%) lymphopenia, 20 (26.0%) categorized as severe patients, and 28 (36.4%) occurred complications. By the end of follow-up, 64 (83.1%) patients were discharged home after being tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infections, 8 remained in hospital and 5 died. 36 (46.8%) patients were discharged within 14 days and thus reached the study endpoint, including 34 (59.6%) of 57 non-severe patients and 2 (10%) of 20 severe patients. The overall cumulative probability of the endpoint was 48.3%. Hospital length of stay and duration of exposure to discharge for 64 discharged patients were 13 (10-16.5) and 23 (18-24.5) days, respectively. Multivariable stepwise Cox regression model showed bilateral pneumonia on CT scan, shorter time from the illness onset to admission, severity of disease and lymphopenia were independently associated with longer hospitalized duration.

ConclusionsCOVID-19 has significantly shorter duration of disease and hospital length of stay than SARS. Bilateral pneumonia on CT scan, shorter period of illness onset to admission, lymphopenia, severity of disease are the risk factors for longer hospitalization duration of COVID-19.","Zhao, W.; Yu, S.; Zha, X.; Wang, N.; Pang, Q.; Li, T.; Li, A.",2020-03-30,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.13.20035436,2,Aixin Li,"Department of Infection Diseases, Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035436v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035436v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

8044,Multiplexed and extraction-free amplification for simplified SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests,"The rapid onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic has led to multiple challenges for accurately diagnosing the infection. One of the main bottlenecks for COVID-19 detection is reagent and material shortages for sample collection, preservation, and purification prior to testing. Currently, most authorized diagnostic tests require RNA extraction from patient samples and detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, RNA purification is expensive, time consuming, and requires technical expertise to perform. Additionally, there have been reported shortages of the RNA purification kits needed for most tests. With these challenges in mind, we report on extraction-free amplification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA directly from patient samples. In addition, we have developed a multiplex RT-PCR using the CDC singleplex targets. This multiplex has a limit of detection of 2 copies/L. We have demonstrated these improvements to the current diagnostic workflow, which reduce complexity and cost, minimize reagent usage, expedite time to results, and increase testing capacity.","Byrnes, S.

10792,Transmission Dynamics of the COVID-19 Epidemics in England,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused a tremendous health burden and impact on the world economy. As one of the European countries experiencing one of the worst COVID-19 epidemics, the UK government at the end of March 2020 implemented the biggest lockdown of society during peacetime in British history, aiming to contain the rapid spread of the virus. While the lockdown has been maintained for seven weeks in UK, the effectiveness of the control measures in suppressing the transmission of the disease remains incompletely understood. Here we applied a Bayesian SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed) epidemiological model to rebuild the local transmission dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in nine regions of England. We found that the basic reproduction number (R0) in England is relatively high compared with China. Our estimation of the temporally varying effective reproduction number (Rt) suggests that the control measures, especially the forceful lockdown, were effective to reduce the transmissibility and curb the COVID-19 epidemic. Although the overall incidence rate in the UK has declined, our forecasting highlights the possibility of a second wave of the disease in several regions, which may be currently underway in one of the cities there (e.g. Leicester, East Midlands). This study enhances our understanding of the current outbreak and effectiveness of control measures in the UK.","Liu, Y.; Tang, J. W.; Lam, T.

11275,Association of Cancer with Risk and Mortality of COVID-19: Results from the UK Biobank,"Although cancer has been associated with COVID-19 risk and mortality in hospital-based studies, few population-based studies have been reported. Utilizing data from the UK Biobank (UKB), a population-based prospective cohort, we formally tested the association of over 44 different types of cancer with COVID-19 infection and mortality among 7,661 subjects who were tested by June 17, 2020. Compared to non-cancer subjects, cancer subjects (N=1,521) had significantly lower overall risk for COVID-19 infection [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.79 (0.68-0.92), P=2.60E-03]. However, a trend of higher risk for COVID-19 mortality was found among 256 COVID-19 positive cancer patients, especially for hematologic cancers such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma [3.82 (1.17-12.01), P=0.02]. In cancer patients, while few demographic, lifestyle, genetic and comorbidity factors predicted risk for COVID-19 infection, older age, male sex, heart disease and hypertension significantly predicted COVID-19 mortality. The lower risk for COVID-19 infection is likely due to extra caution in COVID-19 prevention and more testing among cancer patients, an encouraging finding that demonstrates the feasibility of intervention. These results, if confirmed in future releases of UKB data and other independent populations, may provide guidance for COVID-19 prevention and treatment among cancer patients.","Shi, Z.; Resurreccion, W.

8289,Continuous Electroencephalography (cEEG) Characteristics and Acute Symptomatic Seizures in COVID-19 Patients,"BackgroundNeurological manifestations of COVID-19 have only recently been described, with a paucity of literature reporting the potential relationship between COVID-19 and acute symptomatic seizures. Two prior studies found no clinical or electrographic seizures in their cohorts of COVID-19 patients with altered mental status (AMS) and clinical seizure-like events (SLEs).

MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, 22 critically-ill COVID-19 patients above the age of 18 years who underwent EEG (electroencephalography) monitoring between April 20th, 2020 and May 20th, 2020 were studied. 19 patients underwent continuous EEG (cEEG) for at least 24 hours, and 3 patients underwent routine EEGs (<1 hour). Demographics including age, gender, comorbid medical, and neurological conditions were collected. Clinical variables included EEG findings, anti-seizure medications, discharge disposition, and survival.

Findings17 patients underwent EEG monitoring for unexplained altered mental status changes and 5 patients underwent monitoring for a seizure-like event. 5 patients had epileptiform abnormalities on EEG (4 patients on cEEG, 1 on routine EEG); and only 2 of 5 epileptic EEG patients had a prior history of epilepsy. 2 patients in our cohort had electrographic seizures in the absence of prior epilepsy history. No patients with epileptiform abnormalities or electrographic seizures had acutely abnormal neuroimaging on CT or MRI.

InterpretationEncephalopathic COVID-19 positive patients had a range of EEG abnormalities, and a higher proportion of patients in this series had electrographic seizures than previous literature suggests. This may be influenced by the duration of monitoring with cEEG and the use of a 21 channel electrode system. cEEG findings may help to guide antiseizure medical therapy, as well as the workup of altered mental status in the setting of unremarkable neuroimaging.

8499,Targeted Immunosuppression Distinguishes COVID-19 from Influenza in Moderate and Severe Disease,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by a high incidence of acute respiratory failure. The underlying immunopathology of that failure and how it compares to other causes of severe respiratory distress, such as influenza virus infection, are not fully understood. Here we addressed this by developing a prospective observational cohort of COVID-19 and influenza subjects with varying degrees of disease severity and assessing the quality and magnitude of their immune responses at the cellular and protein level. Additionally, we performed single-cell RNA transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from select subjects. The cohort consists of 79 COVID-19 subjects, 26 influenza subjects, and 15 control subjects, including 35 COVID-19 and 7 influenza subjects with acute respiratory failure. While COVID-19 subjects exhibited largely equivalent or greater activated lymphocyte counts compared to influenza subjects, they had fewer monocytes and lower surface HLA-class II expression on monocytes compared to influenza subjects and controls. At least two distinct immune profiles were observed by cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients: 3 of 71 patients were characterized by extreme inflammation, with greater than or equal to [~]50% of the 35 cytokines measured greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean level of other severe patients (both influenza and COVID-19); the other immune profile, which characterized 68 of 71 subjects, had a mixed inflammatory signature, where 28 of 35 cytokines in COVID-19 patients had lower mean cytokine levels, though not all were statistically significant. Only 2 cytokines were higher in COVID-19 subjects compared to influenza subjects (IL-6 and IL-8). Influenza and COVID-19 patients could be distinguished statistically based on cytokine module expression, particularly after controlling for the significant effects of age on cytokine expression, but again with lower levels of most cytokines in COVID-19 subjects. Further, high circulating levels of IL-1RA and IL-6 were associated with increased odds of intubation in the combined influenza and COVID-19 cohort [OR = 3.93 and 4.30, respectively] as well as among only COVID-19 patients. Single cell transcriptional profiling of COVID-19 and influenza subjects with respiratory failure identified profound suppression in type I and type II interferon signaling in COVID-19 patients across multiple clusters. In contrast, COVID-19 cell clusters were enriched for alterations in metabolic, stress, and apoptotic pathways. These alterations were consistent with an increased glucocorticoid response in COVID-19 patients compared to influenza. When considered across the spectrum of innate and adaptive immune profiles, the immune pathologies underlying severe influenza and COVID-19 are substantially distinct. The majority of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure do not have a cytokine storm phenotype but instead exhibit profound type I and type II IFN immunosuppression when compared to patients with acute influenza. Upregulation of a small number of inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, predicts acute respiratory failure in both COVID-19 and influenza patients.","Mudd, P. A.; Crawford, J. C.; Turner, J.

12173,An Analysis of Outbreak Dynamics and Intervention Effects for COVID-19 Transmission in Europe,"As of March 13, 2020, Europe became the center of COVID-19 pandemic. In order to prevent further spread and slow down the increase in confirmed cases and deaths, many countries in European Union have taken some interventions since mid-March. In this study, a metapopulation model was used to model the outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe and the effectiveness of these interventions were also estimated. The findings suggested that many countries successfully kept the reproduction number Rt less than 1 (e.g., Belgium, Germany, Spain, and France) while other countries exhibited Rt greater than 1 (e.g., United Kingdom, Cyprus). Based on the assumed reopen strategy, this study also revealed that a 2-week delay in response predicted approximately 2,000 deaths and 200,000 cases (daily peak value), while a 3-week delay predicted approximately 5,000 deaths and 600,000 cases (daily peak value). Therefore, a quick response upon signs of a re-emerging pandemic in the world is highly imperative to mitigate potential loss of life and to keep transmission of Covid-19 under control.","Wang, W.",2020-07-25,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.07.21.20158873,1,Wei Wang,"R&D, Lab management, and Bioinformatics, IT, Merck Holding (China), Shanghai, China, a business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20158873v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20158873v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
16190,Using Test Positivity and Reported Case Rates to Estimate State-Level COVID-19 Prevalence and Seroprevalence in the United States,"Accurate estimates of infection prevalence and seroprevalence are essential for evaluating and informing public health responses needed to address the ongoing spread of COVID-19 in the United States. A data-driven Bayesian single parameter semi-empirical model was developed and used to evaluate state-level prevalence and seroprevalence of COVID-19 using daily reported cases and test positivity ratios. COVID-19 prevalence is well-approximated by the geometric mean of the positivity rate and the reported case rate. As of December 8, 2020, we estimate nation-wide a prevalence of 1.4% [Credible Interval (CrI): 0.8%-1.9%] and a seroprevalence of 11.1% [CrI: 10.1%-12.2%], with state-level prevalence ranging from 0.3% [CrI: 0.2%-0.4%] in Maine to 3.0% [CrI: 1.1%-5.7%] in Pennsylvania, and seroprevalence from 1.4% [CrI: 1.0%-2.0%] in Maine to 22% [CrI: 18%-27%] in New York. The use of this simple and easy-to-communicate model will improve the ability to make public health decisions that effectively respond to the ongoing pandemic.

19910,Simple quantitative assessment of the outdoor versus indoor airborne transmission of viruses and covid-19,"In this paper we develop a simple model of the inhaled flow rate of aerosol particles of respiratory origin i.e. that have been exhaled by other humans. A connection is made between the exposure dose and the probability of developing an airborne disease. This allows a simple assessment of the outdoor versus indoor risk of contamination to be made in a variety of meteorological situations. It is shown quantitatively that for most cases, the outdoor risk is orders of magnitude less than the indoor risk and that it can become comparable only for extremely specific meteorological and geographical situations. It sheds a light on various observations of Covid-19 spreading in mountain valleys with temperature inversions while at the same time other areas are much less impacted.

19993,Covid-19 Pandemic and Behavioural Response To Self-Medication Practice In Western Uganda,"BackgroundSelf-medication has become is a serious public health problem globally posing great risks, especially with the increasing number of cases of COVID-19 disease in Uganda. This is may be partly because of the absence of a recognized treatment for the disease, however, the prevalence and nature differ from country to country which may influence human behavioural responses.

AimThis study aimed to investigated the beharioural response of the community towards self- medication practices during this COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown.

MethodsA cross sectional household and online survey was conducted during the months of June-to- August. The study was conducted among adult between age 18 above in communities of western Uganda who consented to participate in the study. Study participants were selected using a convenience sampling technique and sampling was done by sending a structured online questionnaire via Google forms and a printed copies questionnaire made available to other participants that did not use the online questionnaire

ResultsThe percentage of respondents that know about self-medication is (97%) and those that practice self-medication are approximately (88%). 97% of respondents have heard about self-medication either through health workers, media, family members, friends and/or school while 3% said they have not heard about self-medication. The percentage of respondents who practiced self- medication during COVID-19 pandemic is 57% while those that did not is 43%. There is statistically difference in the number of those that practice self-medication and those that do not p < 0.005 at 95% confidence interval. Also there was a statistically significant decrease in the number of respondents that practice self-medication during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown compare to the practice before the pandemic lockdown p < 0.05 at 95% confidence interval.

ConclusionOur investigation showed adequate knowledge of self-medication and high level of self- medication practice with a decrease in self-medication practices during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown compared to the practice before the lockdown.","Dare, S.

8577,"Age differences in clinical features and outcomes in patients with COVID-19, Jiangsu, China: a retrospective, multi-center cohort study","ObjectivesTo determine the age-specific clinical presentations and incidence of adverse outcomes among patients with COVID-19 in Jiangsu, China.

Design and settingThis is a retrospective, multi-center cohort study performed at twenty-four hospitals in Jiangsu, China.

ParticipantsFrom January 10 to March 15, 2020, 625 patients with COVID-19 were involved.

ResultsOf the 625 patients (median age, 46 years; 329 [52.6%] males), 37 (5.9%) were children (18 years or less), 261 (40%) young adults (19-44 years), 248 (39.7%) middle-aged adults (45-64 years), and 79 (12.6%) elderly (65 years or more). The incidence of hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes comorbidities increased with age (trend test, P <.0001, P = 0.0003, P <.0001, and P <.0001 respectively). Fever, cough, and shortness of breath occurred more commonly among older patients, especially the elderly, compared to children (Chi-square test, P = 0.0008, 0.0146, and 0.0282, respectively). The quadrant score and pulmonary opacity score increased with age (trend test, both P <.0001). Older patients had significantly more abnormal values in many laboratory parameters than younger patients. Elderly patients contributed the highest proportion of severe or critically-ill cases (33.0%, Chi-square test P < 0.001), intensive care unit (ICU) (35.4%, Chi-square test P < 0.001), and respiratory failure (31.6%, Chi-square test P = 0.0266), and longest hospital stay (21 days, ANOVA-test P < 0.001).

ConclusionsElderly ([&ge;]65) patients with COVID-19 had the highest risk of severe or critical illness, intensive care use, respiratory failure, and the longest hospital stay, which may be due partly to that they had higher incidence of comorbidities and poor immune responses to COVID-19.

Strengths and limitations of this studyThe cohort consists of almost all COVID-19 patients in Jiangsu province with a population over 80 million and its results should be representative of the patient population in the whole province and with a wide range of disease severity, therefore the results are subject to less selection bias.

The study includes imported and local cases and could study patients with different types of exposures.

The relative short follow-up time and a very small proportion of patients who remained in hospital after the 14-day follow-up period yield incomplete estimates for disease severity and clinical outcomes.","Luo, H.; Liu, S.; Wang, Y.; Phillips-Howard, P.

20907,ARE GEOGRAPHIC FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH POORER OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH COVID-19?,"BackgroundThe prognosis of patients with COVID-19, with older age and comorbidities, is associated with a more severe course and higher fatality rates but no analysis has yet included factors related to the geographical area/municipality in which the affected patients live. So the objective of this study is to analyse the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 in terms of sex, age, comorbidities, and geographic variables.

MethodsA retrospective cohort of 6286 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 was analysed, considering demographic data, previous comorbidities and geographic variables. The main study variables were hospital admission, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and death due to worsening symptoms; and the secondary variables were sex, age, comorbidities and geographic variables (size of the area of residence, distance to the hospital and the driving time to the hospital). A comparison analysis and a multivariate Cox model were performed.

ResultsThe multivariate Cox model showed that women had a better prognosis in any type of analysed prognosis. Most of the comorbidities studied were related to a poorer prognosis except for dementia, which is related to lower admissions and higher mortality. Suburban areas were associated with greater mortality and with less hospital or ICU admission. Distance to the hospital was also associated with hospital admission.

ConclusionsFactors such as type of municipality and distance to hospital act as social health determinants. This fact must be taken account in order to stablish specifics prevention measures and treatment protocols.","Magallon-Botaya, R.; Olivan-Blazquez, B.; Ramirez-Cervantes, K.; Lopez-Mendez, F.; Casajuana-Closas, M.; Andres-Esteban, E.",2021-01-26,Primary Care Research,10.1101/2021.01.25.21250404,1,Barbara Olivan-Blazquez,University of Zaragoza,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.25.21250404v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.25.21250404v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
2987,Early chest computed tomography to diagnose COVID-19 from suspected patients: A multicenter retrospective study,"ObjectiveThe purpose of this study is to distinguish the imaging features of COVID-19 with other chest infectious diseases and evaluate diagnostic value of chest CT for suspected patients.

MethodsAdult suspected patients aged>18 years within 14 days who underwent chest CT scan and reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) tests were enrolled. The enrolled patients were confirmed and grouped according to results of RT-PCR tests. The data of basic demographics, single chest CT features, and combined chest CT features were analyzed for confirmed and non-confirmed groups.

ResultsA total of 130 patients were enrolled with 54 cases positive and 76 cases negative. The typical CT imaging features of positive group were ground glass opacity (GGO), crazy-paving pattern and air bronchogram. The lesions were mostly distributed bilaterally, close to the lower lungs or the pleura. When features combined, GGO with bilateral pulmonary distribution and GGO with pleural distribution were more common, of which were 31 cases (57.4%) and 30 cases (55.6%) respectively. The combinations were almost presented statistically significant (P<0.05) except for the combination of GGO with consolidation. Most combinations presented relatively low sensitivity but extremely high specificity. The average specificity of these combinations is around 90%.

ConclusionsThe combinations of GGO could be useful in the identification and differential diagnosis of COVID-19, which alerts clinicians to isolate patients for treatment promptly and repeat RT-PCR tests until incubation ends.","Miao, C.; Jin, M.; Miao, L.; Yang, X.; Huang, P.; Xiong, H.; Huang, P.; Zhao, Q.; Du, J.; Hong, J.",2020-03-26,Radiology And Imaging,10.1101/2020.03.24.20042432,1,Jiang Hong,"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042432v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042432v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.051
2852,Chinese and Italian COVID-19 outbreaks can be correctly described by a modified SIRD model,"The COVID-19 disease is rapidly spreading in whole globe, affecting millions of people and pushing governments to take drastic measures to contain the outbreaks. The understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic is of great interest for the governments and health authorities that are facing COVID-19 outbreaks. The scarce presence of epidemiologic data, due to the still ongoing outbreaks, makes prediction difficult and mainly based on heuristic (fitting) models. However, these models with non-physical based parameters, can only give limited insight in the evolution of the outbreaks. In this work a SIRD compartmental model was developed to describe and predict the evolution of the Chinese and Italian outbreaks. Exploiting the similarities of the measures taken by the governments to contain the virus and of the total population number of Hubei province and Italy, the model was tuned on the Chinese outbreak (almost extinguished) and by perturbation the Italian outbreak was describe and predicted.","Caccavo, D.",2020-04-21,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.19.20039388,3,Diego Caccavo,"Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Salerno",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20039388v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20039388v3.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
2757,Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: preliminary results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial,"BackgroundChloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2, and reported to be efficient in Chinese COV-19 patients. We evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads.

Patients and methodsPatients were included in a single arm protocol to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasal swabs was tested daily. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point.

ResultsTwenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination.

ConclusionHydroxychloroquine is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.","Gautret, P.; Lagier, J.

11489,Development of a severity of disease score and classification model by machine learning for hospitalized COVID-19 patients,"BACKGROUNDEfficient and early triage of hospitalized Covid-19 patients to detect those with higher risk of severe disease is essential for appropriate case management.

METHODSWe trained, validated, and externally tested a machine-learning model to early identify patients who will die or require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization from clinical and laboratory features obtained at admission. A development cohort with 918 Covid-19 patients was used for training and internal validation, and 352 patients from another hospital were used for external testing. Performance of the model was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity.

RESULTSA total of 363 of 918 (39.5%) and 128 of 352 (36.4%) Covid-19 patients from the development and external testing cohort, respectively, required mechanical ventilation or died during hospitalization. In the development cohort, the model obtained an AUC of 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 0.87) for predicting severity of disease progression. Variables ranked according to their contribution to the model were the peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, updated Charlson comorbidity index and lymphocytes. In the external testing cohort, the model performed an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.85). This model is deployed in an open source calculator, in which Covid-19 patients at admission are individually stratified as being at high or non-high risk for severe disease progression.

7236,COVID-19 genomic susceptibility: Definition of ACE2 variants relevant to human infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the context of ACMG/AMP Guidance,"BackgroundMortality remains very high and unpredictable in CoViD-19, with intense public protection strategies tailored to preceived risk. Males are at greater risk of severe CoViD-19 complications. Genomic studies are in process to identify differences in host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsGenomic structures were examined for the ACE2 gene that encodes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the obligate receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Variants in 213,158 exomes/genomes were integrated with ACE2 protein functional domains, and pathogenicity criteria from the American Society of Human Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology.

Results483 variants were identified in the 19 exons of ACE2 on the X chromosome. All variants were rare, including nine loss-of-function (potentially SARS-CoV-2 protective) alleles present only in female heterozygotes. Unopposed variant alleles were more common in males (262/3596 [7.3%] nucleotides) than females (9/3596 [0.25%] nucleotides, p<0.0001). 37 missense variants substituted amino acids in SARS-CoV-2 interacting regions or critical domains for transmembrane ACE2 expression. Four upstream open reading frames with 31 associated variants were identified. Excepting loss-of-function alleles, variants would not meet minimum criteria for classification as  Likely Pathogenic/beneficial if differential frequencies emerged in patients with CoViD-19.

ConclusionsMales are more exposed to consequences from a single variant ACE2 allele. Common risk/beneficial alleles are unlikely in regions subject to evolutionary constraint. ACE2 upstream open reading frames may have implications for aminoglycoside use in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. For this SARS-CoV-2-interacting protein with pre-identified functional domains, pre-emptive functional and computational studies are encouraged to accelerate interpretations of genomic variation for personalised and public health use.","Shovlin, C.

12298,Using social contact data to predict and compare the impact of social distancing policies with implications for school re-opening,"BackgroundSocial distancing measures, including school closures, are being used to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission in many countries. Once ""lockdown"" has driven incidence to low levels, selected activities are being permitted. Re-opening schools is a priority because of the welfare and educational impact of closures on children. However, the impact of school re-opening needs to be considered within the context of other measures.

MethodsWe use social contact data from the UK to predict the impact of social distancing policies on the reproduction number. We calibrate our tool to the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK using publicly available death data and Google Community Mobility Reports. We focus on the impact of re-opening schools against a back-drop of wider social distancing easing.

ResultsWe demonstrate that pre-collected social contact data, combined with incidence data and Google Community Mobility Reports, is able to provide a time-varying estimate of the reproduction number (R). From an pre-control setting when R=2.7 (95%CI 2.5, 2.9), we estimate that the minimum reproduction number that can be achieved in the UK without limiting household contacts is 0.45 (95%CI: 0.41 - 0.50); in the absence of other changes, preventing leisure contacts has a smaller impact (R = 2.0, 95%CI: 1.8 - 2.4) than preventing work contacts (R = 1.5, 95%CI: 1.4 - 1.7). We find that following lockdown (when R=0.7 (95% CI 0.6, 0.8)), opening primary schools in isolation has a modest impact on transmission R = 0.83 (95%CI: 0.77 - 0.90) but that high adherence to other measures is needed. Opening secondary schools as well as primary school is predicted to have a larger overall impact (R = 0.95, 95%CI: 0.85 - 1.07), however transmission could still be controlled with effective contact tracing.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest that primary school children can return to school without compromising transmission, however other measures, such as social distancing and contract tracing, are required to control transmission if all age groups are to return to school. Our tool provides a mapping from policies to the reproduction number and can be used by policymakers to compare the impact of social-easing measures, dissect mitigation strategies and support careful localized control strategies.","Brooks-Pollock, E.; Read, J.

10967,Heterogeneity in SIR epidemics modeling: superspreaders,"Deterministic epidemic models, such as the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, are immensely useful even if they lack the nuance and complexity of social contacts at the heart of network science modeling. Here we present a simple modification of the SIR equations to include the heterogeneity of social connection networks. A typical power-law model of social interactions from network science reproduces the observation that individuals with a high number of contacts, ""hubs"" or ""superspreaders"", can become the primary conduits for transmission. Conversely, once the tail of the distribution is saturated, herd immunity sets in at a smaller overall recovered fraction than in the analogous SIR model. The new dynamical equations suggest that cutting off the tail of the social connection distribution, i.e., stopping superspreaders, is an efficient non-pharmaceutical intervention to slow the spread of a pandemic, such as COVID-19.","Szapudi, I.",2020-07-06,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.02.20145490,1,Istvan Szapudi,University of Hawaii,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20145490v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20145490v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
19338,Sheltering in place and the likelihood of non-natural death,"Increasing hospitalizations for COVID-19 in the United States (US) and elsewhere have ignited debate over whether to reinstate shelter-in-place policies adopted early in the pandemic to slow the spread of infection. The debate includes claims that sheltering in place influences deaths unrelated to infection or other natural causes. Testing this claim should improve the benefit/cost accounting that presumably informs the decision of whether to reimpose sheltering in place. To distinguish effects of shelter-in-place policies from other events in the pandemic, we compare experiences in two large US states with markedly different policies. We use time-series methods to compare temporal variation in non-natural deaths in California to that in Florida. California was the first state to begin and among the last to end sheltering in place while sheltering began later and ended earlier in Florida. We find that during weeks when California had shelter-in-place orders in effect, but Florida did not, the odds that a non-natural death occurred in California rather than Florida fell 14.8% below values expected from history. These results suggest that sheltering-in-place policies reduce mortality from mechanisms unrelated to infection or other natural causes of death.

Significance StatementWe address what has become an unusually important, but contentious, question - Did mandated sheltering in place affect the incidence of non-natural death in the United States? We use time-series methods to exploit a ""natural experiment"" in which California and Florida imposed and relaxed stay-at-home orders at different times. We find that shelter-in-place orders likely reduced non-natural mortality. We argue that ignoring averted non-natural deaths will lead not only to an underestimate of the benefits of the shelter-in-place policies, but also to an undercount of the impact of COVID-19 infections on natural deaths.","Catalano, R.; Glymour, M.; Chen, Y.-H.; Bibbins-Domingo, K.",2020-12-16,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.12.15.20248261,1,Ralph Catalano,"University of California, Berkeley",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.15.20248261v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.15.20248261v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
8365,The association between treatment with heparin and survival in patients with Covid-19,"ObjectivesThis study investigates the association between the treatment with heparin and mortality in patients admitted with Covid-19.

MethodsRoutinely recorded, clinical data, up to the 24th of April 2020, from the 2075 patients with Covid-19, admitted in 17 hospitals in Spain between the 1st of March and the 20th of April 2020 were used. The following variables were extracted for this study: age, gender, temperature, and saturation of oxygen on admission, treatment with heparin, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, steroids, tocilizumab, a combination of lopinavir with ritonavir, and oseltamivir, together with data on mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations.

ResultsAt the time of collecting the data, 301 patients had died, 1447 had been discharged home from the hospitals, 201 were still admitted, and 126 had been transferred to hospitals not included in the study. Median follow up time was 8 (IQR:5-12) days. Heparin had been used in 1734 patients. Heparin was associated with lower mortality when the model was adjusted for age and gender, with OR (95%CI): 0.55 (0.37-0.82) p=0.003. This association remained significant when saturation of oxygen <90%, and temperature >37C were added to de model with OR: 0.54(0.36-0.82) p=0.003, and also when all the other drugs were included as covariates OR: 0.42 (0.26-0.66) p<0.001.

ConclusionsThe association between heparin and lower mortality observed in this study can be acknowledged by clinicians in hospitals and in the community. Randomized controlled trials to assess the causal effects of heparin in different therapeutic regimes are required.

- The administration of heparin was associated with lower mortality in patients admitted with Covid-19.
- Our findings support that there is a thrombotic component in the development of respiratory distress for these patients.
- The positive effect of heparin seems consistent and its use, when indicated, could be considered in clinical settings.
- Randomized controlled trials are necessary to complement observational studies, and assess the causal associations between heparin, in different therapeutic regimes, and clinical outcomes.
- Heparin is easy to administer, its use in ambulatory patients, to prevent admissions, or reduce their duration, could also be considered by clinicians and future researchers.","Ayerbe, L.; Risco, C.; Ayis, S.",2020-05-29,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.27.20114694,1,Luis Ayerbe,Queen Mary University of London,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.20114694v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.20114694v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1007/s11239-020-02162-z
7873,Risk factors affecting COVID-19 case fatality rate: A quantitative analysis of top 50 affected countries,"BackgroundLatest clinical data on treatment on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) indicated that older patients and those with underlying history of smoking, hypertension or diabetes mellitus might have poorer prognosis of recovery from COVID-19. We aimed to examine the relationship of various prevailing population-based risk factors in comparison with mortality rate and case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19.

MethodsDemography and epidemiology data which have been identified as verified or postulated risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 were used. The number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths until April 16, 2020 for all affected countries were extracted from Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 websites. Datasets for indicators that are fitting with the factors of COVID-19 mortality were extracted from the World Bank database. Out of about 185 affected countries, only top 50 countries were selected to be analyzed in this study. The following seven variables were included in the analysis, based on data availability and completeness: 1) proportion of people aged 65 above, 2) proportion of male in the population, 3) diabetes prevalence, 4) smoking prevalence, 5) current health expenditure, 6) number of hospital beds and 7) number of nurses and midwives. Quantitative analysis was carried out to determine the correlation between CFR and the aforementioned risk factors.

ResultsUnited States shows about 0.20% of confirmed cases in its country and it has about 4.85% of CFR. Luxembourg shows the highest percentage of confirmed cases of 0.55% but a low 2.05% of CFR, showing that a high percentage of confirmed cases does not necessarily lead to high CFR. There is a significant correlation between CFR, people aged 65 and above (p = 0.35) and diabetes prevalence (p = 0.01). However, in our study, there is no significant correlation between CFR of COVID-19, male gender (p = 0.26) and smoking prevalence (p = 0.60).

ConclusionOlder people above 65 years old and diabetic patients are significant risk factors for COVID-19.

15151,COPD in the time of COVID-19: An analysis of acute exacerbations and reported behavioural changes in patients with COPD,"ABSTRACT Introduction: The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and lockdown measures, on acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the change in AECOPD treatment frequency during the first six weeks of lockdown in the UK compared with 2019 and assess changes in self-reported behaviour and well-being. Methods: In this observational study patients with established COPD were recruited. Exacerbation frequency was measured in the first six weeks of COVID lockdown and compared with the same period in 2019 using electronic health records. A telephone survey was used to assess changes in anxiety, inhaler adherence, physical activity, shopping and visitor behaviour during the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods compared to normal. Results: 160 participants were recruited (mean [SD] age 67.3 [8.1] years, 88 [55%] male, FEV1 34.3 [13] % predicted) and 140 [88%] reported at least one AECOPD in the previous year. Significantly more community treated exacerbations were observed in 2020 compared with 2019 (126 vs 99, p=0.026). The increase was as a result of multiple courses of treatment, with a similar proportion of patients receiving at least one course (34.4% vs 33.8%). During 'lockdown' participants reported significantly increased anxiety, adherence to their preventative inhalers, and good adherence to shielding advice (all p<0.001). A significant reduction in self-reported physical activity and visitors was reported (both p<0.001). Discussion: Treatment for AECOPD events increased during the first six weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the UK compared to 2019. This was associated with increased symptoms of anxiety and significant behavioural change.","Mcauley, H. J. C.; Hadley, K.; Elneima, O.; Brightling, C. E.; Evans, R.; Steiner, M.

6784,Capsid integrity quantitative PCR to determine virus infectivity in environmental and food applications; a systematic review,"Capsid-integrity quantitative PCR (qPCR), a molecular detection method for infectious viruses combining azo-dye pretreatment with qPCR, has been widely used in recent years; however, variations in pretreatment conditions for various virus types can limit the efficacy of specific protocols. By identifying and critically synthesizing forty-two recent peer-reviewed studies employing capsid-integrity qPCR for viruses in the last decade (2009 to 2019) in the fields of food safety and environmental virology, we aimed to establish recommendations for the detection of infectious viruses. Intercalating dyes are effective measures of viability in PCR assays provided the viral capsid is damaged; viruses that have been inactivated by other causes, such as loss of attachment or genomic damage, are less well detected using this approach. Although optimizing specific protocols for each virus is recommended, we identify a framework for general assay conditions. These include concentrations of ethidium monoazide, propidium monoazide or its derivates between 10 and 200 {micro}M; incubation on ice or at room temperature (20 - 25{degrees}C) for 5 to 120 min; and dye activation using LED or high light (500 - 800 Watts) exposure for periods ranging from 5 to 20 min. These simple steps can benefit the investigation of infectious virus transmission in routine (water) monitoring settings and during viral outbreaks such as the current COVID-19 pandemic or endemic diseases like dengue fever.

18798,"The impact of seasonal respiratory virus transmission on syndromic surveillance for COVID-19 in Ontario, Canada","BackgroundSyndromic surveillance systems for COVID-19 are being increasingly used to track and predict outbreaks of confirmed cases. Seasonal circulating respiratory viruses share syndromic overlap with COVID-19, and it is unknown how they will impact the performance of syndromic surveillance tools. Here we investigated the role of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory virus test positivity on COVID-19 two independent syndromic surveillance systems in Ontario, Canada.

MethodsWe compared the weekly number of reported COVID-19 cases reported in the province of Ontario against two syndromic surveillance metrics: 1) the proportion of respondents with a self-reported COVID-like illness (CLI) from COVID Near You (CNY) and 2) the proportion of emergency department visits for upper respiratory conditions from the Acute Care Enhanced Surveillance (ACES) system. Separately, we plotted the percent positivity for other seasonal respiratory viruses over the same time period and reported Pearsons correlation coefficients before and after the uncoupling of syndromic tools to COVID-19 cases.

ResultsThere were strong positive correlations of both CLI and ED visits for upper respiratory causes with COVID-19 cases up to and including a rise in entero/rhinovirus (r = 0.86 and 0.87, respectively). There was a strong negative correlation of both CLI and ED visits for upper respiratory causes with COVID-19 cases (r = -0.85 and -0.91, respectively) during a fall in entero/rhinovirus.

InterpretationTwo methods of syndromic surveillance showed strong positive correlations with COVID-19 confirmed case counts before and during a rise in circulating entero/rhinovirus. However, as positivity for enterovirus/rhinovirus fell in late September 2020, syndromic signals became uncoupled from COVID-19 cases and instead tracked the fall in entero/rhinovirus. This finding provides proof-of-principle that regional transmission of seasonal respiratory viruses may complicate the interpretation of COVID-19 surveillance data. It is imperative that surveillance systems incorporate other respiratory virus testing data in order to more accurately track and forecast COVID-19 disease activity.","Maharaj, A.

17030,Disruptions to schistosomiasis programmes due to COVID-19: an analysis of potential impact and mitigation strategies,"BackgroundThe 2030 goal for schistosomiasis is elimination as a public health problem (EPHP), with mass drug administration (MDA) of praziquantel to school-aged children (SAC) a central pillar of the strategy. However, due to COVID-19, many mass treatment campaigns for schistosomiasis have been halted with uncertain implications for the programmes.

MethodWe use mathematical modelling to explore how postponement of MDA and various mitigation strategies affect achievement of the EPHP goal for Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium.

ResultsIn moderate and some high prevalence settings, the disruption may delay the goal by up to two years. In some high prevalence settings EPHP is not achievable with current strategies, and so the disruption will not impact this. Here, increasing SAC coverage and treating adults can achieve the goal.

The impact of MDA disruption and the appropriate mitigation strategy varies according to the baseline prevalence prior to treatment, the burden of infection in adults and stage of the programme.

ConclusionsSchistosomiasis MDA programmes in medium and high prevalence areas should restart as soon as is feasible, and mitigation strategies may be required in some settings.","Kura, K.; Ayabina, D.; Toor, J.; Hollingsworth, T.

5899,"Balancing revenue generation with capacity generation: Case distribution, financial impact and hospital capacity changes from cancelling or resuming elective surgeries in the US during COVID-19","BackgroundTo increase bed capacity and resources, hospitals have postponed elective surgeries, although the financial impact of this decision is unknown. We sought to report elective surgical case distribution, associated gross hospital earnings and regional hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity as elective surgical cases are cancelled and then resumed under simulated trends of COVID-19 incidence.

MethodsA retrospective, cohort analysis was performed using insurance claims from 161 million enrollees from the MarketScan database from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2017. COVID-19 cases were calculated using a generalized Richards model. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports on the number of hospitalized and intensive care patients by age were used to estimate the number of cases seen in the ICU, the reduction in elective surgeries and the financial impact of this from historic claims data, using a denominator of all inpatient revenue and outpatient surgeries.

ResultsAssuming 5% infection prevalence, cancelling all elective procedures decreases ICU overcapacity from 340% to 270%, but these elective surgical cases contribute 78% (IQR 74, 80) (1.1 trillion (T) US dollars) to inpatient hospital plus outpatient surgical gross earnings per year. Musculoskeletal, circulatory and digestive category elective surgical cases compose 33% ($447B) of total revenue.

ConclusionsProcedures involving the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and digestive system account for the largest loss of hospital gross earnings when elective surgery is postponed. As hospital bed capacity increases following the COVID-19 pandemic, restoring volume of these elective cases will help maintain revenue.

18284,High resolution proximity statistics as early warning for US universities reopening during COVID-19,"Reopening of colleges and universities for the Fall semester of 2020 across the United States has caused significant COVID-19 case spikes, requiring reactive responses such as temporary closures and switching to online learning. Until sufficient levels of immunity are reached through vaccination, Institutions of Higher Education will need to balance academic operations with COVID-19 spread risk within and outside the student community. In this work, we study the impact of proximity statistics obtained from high resolution mobility traces in predicting case rate surges in university counties. We focus on 50 land-grant university counties (LGUCs) across the country and show high correlation (PCC > 0.6) between proximity statistics and COVID-19 case rates for several LGUCs during the period around Fall 2020 reopenings. These observations provide a lead time of up to [~]3 weeks in preparing resources and planning containment efforts. We also show how features such as total population, population affiliated with university, median income and case rate intensity could explain some of the observed high correlation. We believe these easily explainable mobility metrics along with other disease surveillance indicators can help universities be better prepared for the Spring 2021 semester.","Mehrab, Z.; Ranga, A.

11704,"Preparedness, Perceived Impact and Concerns of health Care Workers in a Teaching Hospital during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","ObjectiveCoronavirus Disease 2019 is a new threat to human lives worldwide. Preparedness of institutions during epidemic outbreak has a pivotal role in saving lives and preventing further spread. At the same time, these pandemics impact badly on professional and personal life of Health care workers. The objective of this study is to find the opinion of Health care workers regarding their level of preparedness, concerns and perceived impact related to this pandemic outbreak.

Materials and Methodsin this study, random samples of doctors and nurses was provided with a self-administered questionnaire regarding their preparedness, work and non-work related concerns and impact on their lives during Covid-19 outbreak.

ResultsMost of the Health Care Workers believed that their institute preparation to fight Covid-19 pandemic is better than prior to onset of this crisis (p0.001). Work related stress was seen more commonly in nurses whereas higher frequency of non-work related stress was observed among doctors. Nurses (75.55%) faith in their employer was more than doctors faith (46.66%) regarding their medical needs. There was more acceptance of hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic drug for Covid-19 in doctors compared to nurses (p 0.01).

ConclusionsThough this institute was more prepared at the time of pandemic spread, substantial opportunity of improvement remains. The consistency of work and non work related anxiety and stress in health care workers is very high in present study group. Concerns and risks of Health Care Workers should be addressed ethically and adequately by strengthening safety measures and building trust in the system they work.","Saurabh, K.; Ranjan, S.",2020-07-17,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.07.15.20140095,1,Kumar Saurabh,"Government Medical College, Bettiah",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20140095v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20140095v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_799_20

So every country should have their own data regarding COVID-19.

Subjects and MethodsThis was an online cross-sectional survey, carried out in RT-PCR positive COVID-19 adult patient. A preformed questionnaire adapted in Google form and circulated through online to collect data. Informed consent was ensured before participation in this study.

ResultsWe have studied of 305 RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients, mean age was 36.32 (+/- 12.369) years with male predominance and majority were doctor 46.9%. 48.8% of the patients family members affected along with them. After COVID-19 pandemic 31.7% did not go out of their house. For prevention 72.4%)of the patients used mask and 38.8% used hand gloves during outing. 28.7% reported to be affected while working in hospital, 21.8%were affected in their office. Fever (80.1%), cough (57.7%), pain in throat (50.8%), rhinitis (45.9%) and loss of smell (45%) & taste sensation (45.6%) were the most common symptoms. Sample was given average 3 (+/- 3.384) days after onset of the symptoms and report was delivered average 4.57 days after giving sample. After getting result 32.1% of the patients seek treatment in telemedicine and 23% directly consulted in Government hospital, only 2% reported to be treated by the Government designated telephone number. 73.1% of the patient took both steam inhalation and warm water gargling. Paracetamol and antihistamine was the most commonly use drugs 69.8% and 71.5% respectively, besides 47.5% took ivermectin, 41.6% took azithromycin, 35.1% steroid, 34.8% took doxycyclin and 21.6% hydroxychloroquine. Among the patients only 20.3% needed hospital admission. The patients admitted in hospital average 5 (+/-3.922) days after onset of symptoms and hospital staying was 9.2 days (average). Breathless (54.83%) was the major cause of hospital admission and 19.35% patients admitted due to fear. 14% patients needed oxygen and average duration of oxygen was 4.84 days. 81.3% patients has taken oxygen in hospital and 18.8% at their home. Among the patient 2.2% needed ICU and artificial ventilation needed for 1.1% patients. The patients recovered after 17.74 days (average) from the onset of symptom. COVID-19 became negative (RT-PCR) at15th day from onset of symptom. 91.8%) were in mental stress to become the cause of infection spread to other family members, 20.7%) reported that they were anxious that they would not get oxygen or ICU if required and 27.9% were suffering from fear of death. Weakness was the most common post disease symptom in 57.4% cases. Average time required for coming back to normal life was 21.59 days (+/-7.901) ranging a wide range from 5 to 60 days.

ConclusionCOVID-19 patients were mostly male, health worker. Fever, cough, pain in throat were most common symptoms. Hospital admission required in only one-fifth cases and ICU required for only 2% patients. Weakness was the most common post disease symptom.","Mondal, R. N.; Razzak Sarker, M. A.; Das, A.; Ahsan, M.

14317,Digital droplet PCR accurately quantifies SARS-CoV-2 viral load from crude lysate without nucleic acid purification,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus motivates diverse diagnostic approaches due to the novel causative pathogen, incompletely understood clinical sequelae, and limited availability of testing resources. Given the variability in viral load across and within patients, absolute viral load quantification directly from crude lysate is important for diagnosis and surveillance. Here, we investigate the use of digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 viral load measurement directly from crude lysate without nucleic acid purification. We demonstrate ddPCR accurately quantifies SARS-CoV-2 standards from purified RNA and multiple sample matrices, including commonly utilized universal transport medium (UTM). In addition, we find ddPCR functions robustly at low input viral copy numbers on nasopharyngeal swab specimens stored in UTM without upfront RNA extraction. We also show ddPCR, but not qPCR, from crude lysate shows high concordance with viral load measurements from purified RNA. Our data suggest ddPCR offers advantages to qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection with higher sensitivity and robustness when using crude lysate rather than purified RNA as input. More broadly, digital droplet assays provide a potential method for nucleic acid measurement and infectious disease diagnosis with limited sample processing, underscoring the utility of such techniques in laboratory medicine.","Vasudevan, H.; Xu, P.; Servellita, V.; Miller, S.; Liu, L.; Gopez, A.; Chiu, C.

2152,"The Effects of ""Fangcang, Huoshenshan, and Leishenshan"" Makeshift Hospitals and Temperature on the Mortality of COVID-19","BackgroundIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, China, however, the factors affecting the mortality remain unclear.

MethodsThirty-two days of data that were shared by China National Health Commission and China Weather Net were collected using standard forms. The difference in the mortality of confirmed and severe cases before and after the use of ""Fangcang, Huoshenshan, and Leishenshan"" makeshift hospitals (MSHs) was tested using Mann-Whitney U test. We also studied whether air temperature (AT) could affect the above outcomes of COVID-19 cases by performing Spearmans analysis.

ResultsThe mortality of confirmed cases was significantly decreased both in Wuhan (U = 1, P < 0.001) and Hubei (U = 0, P < 0.001), while in non-Hubei regions, as a contrast, the mortality of confirmed cases remained unchanged (U = 40, P = 0.139). However, another eight days later, changes in the mortality in non-Hubei regions also became significant (U = 73, P = 0.039). Mortality of confirmed cases was found to be significantly correlated with AT both in Wuhan (r = -0.441, P = 0.012) and Hubei (r = -0.440, P = 0.012).

ConclusionsOur findings indicated that both the use of MSHs and the rise of AT were beneficial to the survival of COVID-19 cases.","Cai, Y.; Huang, T.; Liu, X.; Xu, G.",2020-03-06,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.02.26.20028472,3,Gaosi Xu Sr.,"Department of Nephrology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028472v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028472v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.7717/peerj.9578

Recent evidence suggests blood type may affect risk of severe COVID-19. We used observational healthcare data on 14,112 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 with known blood type in the New York Presbyterian (NYP) hospital system to assess the association between ABO and Rh blood types and infection, intubation, and death. We found slightly increased infection prevalence among non-O types. Risk of intubation was decreased among A and increased among AB and B types, compared with type O, while risk of death was increased for type AB and decreased for types A and B. We estimated Rh-negative blood type to have a protective effect for all three outcomes.

2887,"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Hainan, China","BackgroundSince January 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has spread rapidly and developing the pandemic model around the world. Data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients in an imported cases as model in island outside Wuhan.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective study included all 168 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Hainan province from 22 January 2020 to 13 March 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for demographic, clinical, radiological and laboratory data.

ResultsOf 168 patients, 160 have been discharged, 6 have died and 2 remain hospitalized. The median age was 51.0 years and 51.8% were females. 129 (76.8%) patients were imported cases, and 118 (70.2%), 51 (30.4%) and 52 (31%) of patients lived in Wuhan or traveled to Wuhan, had contact with Covid-19 patients, or had contact with Wuhan residents, respectively. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (65.5%), dry cough (48.8%) and expectoration (32.1%). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (60.2%). The elderly people with diabetes, hypertension and CVD are more likely to develop severe cases. Follow-up of 160 discharged patients found that 20 patients (12.5%) had a positive RT-PCR test results of pharyngeal swabs or anal swabs or fecal.

ConclusionsIn light of the rapid spread of Covid-19 around the world, early diagnosis and quarantine is important to curb the spread of Covid-19 and intensive treatments in early stage is to prevent patients away from critical condition.","Yan, S.; Song, X.; Lin, F.; Zhu, H.; Wang, X.; Li, M.; Ruan, J.; Lin, C.; Liu, X.; Wu, Q.; Luo, Z.; Fu, W.; Chen, S.; Yuan, Y.; Liu, S.; Yao, J.; Lv, C.",2020-03-23,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.19.20038539,1,Chuanzhu Lv,The Second Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038539v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038539v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
8298,COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) Ventilator Resource Management Using a Network Optimization Model and Predictive System Demand,"The COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is overwhelming global healthcare delivery systems due to the exponential spike in cases requiring specialty tests, facilities and equipment, including complex, precision devices like ventilators. In particular, the surge in critically ill patients has revealed a significant deficiency in regional availability of respiratory care ventilators. The authors offer a mathematical framework for ventilator distribution under scarcity conditions using an optimized network model and solver. The framework is interoperable with existing COVID-19 healthcare demand models and scales for different user-defined system sizes, including hospital networks, city, state, regional and national-scale prioritization. The authors approach improves current capabilities for medical device resource management within the existing incident command system while accounting for availability of devices, ventilation treatment time periods, disinfection and cleaning between patients, as well as shipping logistics time. The authors present a proof of concept using a high fidelity COVID-19 data set from Colorado, discusses how to scale nationally, and emphasizes the importance of applying ethical human-in-the-loop decision making when using this or similar approaches to managing medical device resources during epidemic emergencies.","Billingham, S.; Widrick, R.; Edwards, N.

9513,Effects of physical activity and exercise on well-being in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic,"BackgroundA disease discovered in China, COVID-19, was characterized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic in March 2020. Many countries in the world implemented social isolation as a strategy to contain the virus transmission. The same physical distancing which protects society from COVID-19 from spreading may have an impact on the mental health and well-being of the population This study aims to shed some light on this phenomenon by assessing the relationship between physical activity and SWB among individuals in the social isolation period of COVID-19.

MethodsData were collected in Brazil between March 31st and April 2nd, 2020. All volunteers agreed to participate by digitally checking the option of agreement right after reading the Consent Terms. The inclusion criteria were participants over 18 years old who had been in social isolation for at least one week and agreed to the Consent Terms. Three instruments were used: a questionnaire was built for this study which aimed to assess the participants exercise routine. The second instrument called Psychosocial Aspects, Well-being and Exercise in Confinement (PAWEC) was also created by these researchers and aimed to assess the relationship between well-being and physical activity during the social isolation period. And the third measure was the Brazilian Portuguese-adapted version of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS).

FindingsA total of 592 participants reported being in social isolation for an average of 14.4 (SD=3.3) days. The amount of participants who reported strength training as exercise increased from 31 (5.2%) before isolation to 82 (13.9%) during quarantine. The study shows that well-being related to the practice of physical activity during quarantine is linked to an established routine of physical activity prior to the social isolation period.

InterpretationPeople who already practiced physical activity feel more motivated to continue practicing during this period and this causes the appearance of positive affects, unlike people who are only now starting to exercise; according to the study, negative aspects can occur for those who are only just starting. In a period of social isolation, it is important that the practice of physical activity is closer to previous habits, also finding that an obligation to exercise during this period when this was not a reality for the person can contribute to an increase in malaise.","De Abreu, J.

8363,"Covid19db -- An online database of trials of medicinal products to prevent or treat COVID-19, with a specific focus on drug repurposing","BackgroundThe global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus has prompted an unprecedented international effort to seek medicines for prevention and treatment of infection. Drug repurposing has played a key part in this response. The rapid increase in trial activity has raised questions about efficiency and lack of coordination. Our objective was to develop a user-friendly, open access database to monitor and rapidly identify trials of medicinal products.

MethodsUsing the US clinicaltrials.gov (NCT) registry, the EU Clinical Trials Register (EUCTR) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), we identified all COVID-19 trials of medicinal products. Trials that were out of scope and duplicates were excluded. A manual encoding was performed to ascertain key information (e.g. trial aim, type of intervention etc). The database, Covid19db, is published online at: http://www.redo-project.org/covid19db/.

ResultsDescriptive statistics of the database from April 4th 2020 through to August 18th show an increase from 186 to 1618 trials, or an average of 10.5 new trials registered per day. Over this period, the proportion of trials including a repurposing arm decreased slightly (from a maximum of 75% to 64% at the end of the covered period) as did the proportion of trials aiming to prevent infection (from a maximum of 16% to 13%). The most popular trial intervention is hydroxychloroquine (212 trials), followed by azithromycin (64 trials), tocilizumab, favipiravir and chloroquine (145 trials). Total planned enrolment is 1064556 participants as of 18th August 2020.

Conclusionswe have developed an open access and regularly updated tool to monitor clinical trials of medicinal products to prevent or treat infection by SARS-CoV-2 globally. Our analysis shows a high number of  me-too trials, in particular for some repurposed drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and tocilizumab, substantiating calls for better coordination and better use of trial resources.","Pantziarka, P.; Vandeborne, L.; Meheus, L.; Bouche, G.",2020-08-20,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.27.20114371,2,Pan Pantziarka,Anticancer Fund,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.20114371v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.20114371v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
18244,Outbreaks of publications about emerging infectious diseases: the case of SARS-CoV-2 and Zika virus,"BackgroundOutbreaks of infectious diseases generate outbreaks of scientific evidence. In 2016 epidemics of Zika virus emerged, largely in Latin America and the Caribbean. In 2020, a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We compared patterns of scientific publications for the two infections over time.

MethodsWe used living systematic review methods to search for and annotate publications according to study design. For Zika virus, a review team performed the tasks for publications in 2016. For SARS-CoV-2, a crowd of 25 volunteer scientists performed the tasks for publications up to May 24, 2020. We used descriptive statistics to categorise and compare study designs over time.

FindingsWe found 2,286 publications about Zika virus in 2016 and 21,990 about SARS-CoV-2 up to 24 May 2020, of which we analysed a random sample of 5294. For both infections, there were more epidemiological than laboratory science studies. Amongst epidemiological studies for both infections, case reports, case series and cross-sectional studies emerged first, cohort and case-control studies were published later. Trials were the last to emerge. Mathematical modelling studies were more common in SARS-CoV-2 research. The number of preprints was much higher for SARS-CoV-2 than for Zika virus.

InterpretationSimilarities in the overall pattern of publications might be generalizable, whereas differences are compatible with differences in the characteristics of a disease. Understanding how evidence accumulates during disease outbreaks helps us understand which types of public health questions we can answer and when.

17477,Delirium and Post-Discharge Neuropsychological Outcomes in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19: an Institutional Case Series,"Delirium is a serious and common complication among critically ill patients with COVID-19. The objective of this study was to characterize the clinical course of delirium for COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit, including post-discharge cognitive outcomes. A retrospective chart review was conducted for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (n=148) admitted to an intensive care unit at Michigan Medicine between 3/1/2020 and 5/31/2020. Delirium was identified in 107/148 (72%) patients in the study cohort, with median (interquartile range) duration lasting 10 (4 - 17) days. Sedative regimens, inflammation, deviation from delirium prevention protocols, and hypoxic-ischemic injury were likely contributing factors, and the most common disposition for delirious patients was a skilled care facility (41/148, 38%). Among patients who were delirious during hospitalization, 4/17 (24%) later tested positive for delirium at home based on caretaker assessment, 5/22 (23%) demonstrated signs of questionable cognitive impairment or cognitive impairment consistent with dementia, and 3/25 (12%) screened positive for depression within two months after discharge. Overall, patients with COVID-19 commonly experience a prolonged course of delirium in the intensive care unit, likely with multiple contributing factors. Furthermore, neuropsychological impairment may persist after discharge.","Ragheb, J.; Mckinney, A.; Zierau, M.; Brooks, J.; Hill-Caruthers, M.; Iskander, M.; Ahmed, Y.; Lobo, R.; Vlisides, P.

14165,"Seroprevalence and immunity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adolescents in schools in Switzerland: design for a longitudinal, school-based prospective cohort study","IntroductionSeroprevalence and transmission routes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in children and adolescents, especially in school setting, are not clear. Resulting uncertainty is reflected in very different decisions on school closures and reopenings across countries. The aim of this longitudinal cohort study is to assess the extent and patterns of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in school-attending children repeatedly. It will examine risk factors for infection, relationship between seropositivity and symptoms, and temporal persistence of antibodies. Additionally, it will include testing of school personnel and parents.

Methods and analysisThe study (Ciao Corona) will enroll a regionally representative, random sample of schools in the canton of Zurich, where 18% of the Swiss population live. Children aged 5 to 16 years, attending classes in primary and secondary schools are invited. Venous blood and saliva samples are collected for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing after the first wave of infections (June/July 2020), in fall (October/November 2020), and after winter (March/April 2021). Venous blood is also collected for serological testing of parents and school personnel. Bi-monthly questionnaires to children, parents and school personnel cover SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and tests, health, preventive behavior, lifestyle and quality of life information. Total seroprevalence and cumulative incidence will be calculated. Hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression models will account for sensitivity and specificity of the serological test in the analyses and for the complex sampling structure, i.e., clustering within classes and schools.

Ethics and disseminationThe study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland (2020-01336). The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and will be made available to study participants and participating schools, the Federal Office of Public Health, and the Educational Department of the canton of Zurich. Trial registration number NCT04448717.

10475,"Deducing the Dose-response Relation for Coronaviruses from COVID-19, SARS and MERS Meta-analysis Results","The fundamental dose-response relation is still missing for better evaluating and controlling the transmission risk of COVID-19. A recent study by Chu et al. has indicated that the anticipated probability of viral infection is about 12.8% within 1 m and about 2.6% at further distance through a systematic review and meta-analysis. This important information provides us a unique opportunity to assess the dose-response relation of the viruses, if reasonable exposure dose could be estimated. Here we developed a simple framework to integrate the a priori dose-response relation for SARS-CoV based on mice experiments, and the recent data on infection risk and viral shedding, to shed light on the dose-response relation for human. The developed dose-response relation is an exponential function with a constant k in the range of 6.19x104 to 7.28x105 virus copies. The result mean that the infection risk caused by one virus copy in viral shedding is about 1.5x10-6 to 1.6x10-5. The developed dose-response relation provides a tool to quantify the magnitude of the infection risk.","Zhang, X.; Wang, J.",2020-06-26,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.26.20140624,1,Jing Wang,"1.

We hypothesized that males and females in different age groups might have different epidemic trajectories.

MethodsUsing publicly available data from South Korea, daily new COVID-19 cases were fitted with generalized additive models, assuming Poisson and negative binomial distributions. Epidemic dynamics by age and gender groups were explored with interactions between smoothed time terms and age and gender.

ResultsA negative binomial distribution fitted the daily case counts best. Interaction between the dynamic patterns of daily new cases and age groups was statistically significant (p<0.001), but not with gender group. People aged 20-39 years led the epidemic processes in the society with two peaks: one major peak around March 1 and a smaller peak around April 7, 2020. The epidemic process among people aged 60 or above was trailing behind that of younger people with smaller magnitude. After March 15, there was a consistent decline of daily new cases among elderly people, despite large fluctuations of case counts among young adults.

ConclusionsAlthough young people drove the COVID-19 epidemic in the whole society with multiple rebounds, elderly people could still be protected from virus infection after the peak of epidemic.","Yu, X.; Duan, J.; Jiang, Y.; Zhang, H.",2020-06-27,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.27.20114819,3,Xinhua Yu,University of Memphis,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.20114819v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.20114819v3.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.06.101

After gathering data from various resources, all data are integrated and passed into different Machine Learning Models to check the fit. Ensemble Learning Technique,Random Forest, gives a good evaluation score on the test data. Through this technique, various important factors are recognised and their contribution to the spread is analysed. Also, linear relationship between various features is plotted through heatmap of Pearson Correlation matrix. Finally, Kalman Filter is used to estimate future spread of COVID19, which shows good result on test data. The inferences from Random Forest feature importance and Pearson Correlation gives many similarities and some dissimilarities, and these techniques successfully identify the different contributing factors. The Kalman Filter gives a satisfying result for short term estimation, but not so good performance for long term forecasting.

MethodsThis is a retrospective study of 6 COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma at Guizhou Provincial Jiangjunshan Hospital - a tertial hospital, in Guiyang, Guizhou, China, from January 29, to April 30, 2020; final data of follow-up was May 12, 2020. Through the review of the electronic medical records of Guizhou Jiangjunshan Hospital, clinical data of 6 patients were obtained. Three patients with worsening symptoms after empirical treatment with antivirals were transfused convalescent plasma therapy for the first treatment, while the other three severe or critical COVID-19 patients with rapid progression were transfused. The efficacy of convalescent plasma depends on the relief of symptoms, changes in laboratory indicators and chest imaging abnormalities.

ResultsThe PaO2 / FiO2 and lymphocyte count of patients 1, 2 and 3 treated with convalescent plasma treatment for the first treatment period were changed from abnormal to normal. The levels of inflammation markers CRP and IL-6 of the patients decreased significantly. Chest imaging examination showed that the lung lesions gradually subsided.

11383,Maternal and perinatal characteristics and outcomes of pregnancies complicated with COVID-19 in Kuwait,"BackgroundIn late December of 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in the Chinese city Wuhan among a cluster of pneumonia patients. While it is known that pregnant women have reduced immunity and they are at risk for COVID-19 infection during the current pandemic, it is not clear if the disease manifestation would be different in pregnant women from non-pregnant women.

ObjectivesTo describe the maternal and neonatal clinical features as well as outcome of pregnancies complicated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsIn this retrospective national-based study, we analyzed the medical records of all SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant patients and their neonates who were admitted to New-Jahra Hospital, Kuwait, between March 15th 2020 and May 31st 2020. The outcomes of pregnancies were assessed until the end date of follow-up (June 15th 2020).

ResultsA total of 185 pregnant women were enrolled with a median age of 31 years (interquartile range, IQR: 27.5-34), and median gestational age at diagnosis was 29 weeks (IQR: 18-34). The majority (88%) of the patients had mild symptoms, with fever (58%) being the most common presenting symptom followed by cough (50.6%). During the study period, 141 (76.2%) patients continued their pregnancy, 3 (1.6%) had a miscarriage, 1 (0.5%) had intrauterine fetal death and only 2 (1.1%) patients developed severe pneumonia and required intensive care. Most of the neonates were asymptomatic, and only 2 (5%) of them tested positive on day 5 by nasopharyngeal swab testing.

ConclusionPregnant women do not appear to be at higher risk to the COVID-19 than the general population. The clinical features of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar to those of the general population having SARS-CoV-2 infection. Favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes reinforce the existing evidence and may guide healthcare professionals in the management of pregnancies complicated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ayed, A.; Embaireeg, A.; Benawadth, A.; Al-Fouzan, W.; Hammoud, M.; Alhathal, M.; Alzaydai, A.; Ayed, M.",2020-07-14,Obstetrics And Gynecology,10.1101/2020.07.10.20150623,1,Mariam Ayed,"Neonatal Department, Farwaniya Hospital, Kuwait",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150623v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150623v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1186/s12884-020-03461-2
19762,Spotlight on the dark figure: Exhibiting dynamics in the case detection ratio of COVID-19 infections in Germany,"The case detection ratio of COVID-19 infections varies over time due to changing testing capacities, modified testing strategies and also, apparently, due to the dynamics in the number of infected itself. In this paper we investigate these dynamics by jointly looking at the reported number of detected COVID-19 infections with non-fatal and fatal outcomes in different age groups in Germany. We propose a statistical approach that allows us to spotlight the case detection ratio and quantify its changes over time. With this we can adjust the case counts reported at different time points so that they become comparable. Moreover we can explore the temporal development of the real number of infections, shedding light on the dark number. The results show that the case detection ratio has increased and, depending on the age group, is four to six times higher at the beginning of the second wave compared to what it was at the peak of the first wave. The true number of infection in Germany in October was considerably lower as during the peak of the first wave, where only a small fraction of COVID-19 infections were detected. Our modelling approach also allows quantifying the effects of different testing strategies on the case detection ratio. The analysis of the dynamics in the case detection rate and in the true infection figures enables a clearer picture of the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Schneble, M.; De Nicola, G.; Kauermann, G.; Berger, U.",2021-01-05,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.12.23.20248763,2,Marc Schneble,LMU Munich,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.23.20248763v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.23.20248763v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

8682,The ABO blood group locus and a chromosome 3 gene cluster associate with SARS-CoV-2 respiratory failure in an Italian-Spanish genome-wide association analysis,"BackgroundRespiratory failure is a key feature of severe Covid-19 and a critical driver of mortality, but for reasons poorly defined affects less than 10% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

MethodsWe included 1,980 patients with Covid-19 respiratory failure at seven centers in the Italian and Spanish epicenters of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe (Milan, Monza, Madrid, San Sebastian and Barcelona) for a genome-wide association analysis. After quality control and exclusion of population outliers, 835 patients and 1,255 population-derived controls from Italy, and 775 patients and 950 controls from Spain were included in the final analysis. In total we analyzed 8,582,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and conducted a meta-analysis of both case-control panels.

ResultsWe detected cross-replicating associations with rs11385942 at chromosome 3p21.31 and rs657152 at 9q34, which were genome-wide significant (P<5x10-8) in the meta-analysis of both study panels, odds ratio [OR], 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48 to 2.11; P=1.14x10-10 and OR 1.32 (95% CI, 1.20 to 1.47; P=4.95x10-8), respectively. Among six genes at 3p21.31, SLC6A20 encodes a known interaction partner with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The association signal at 9q34 was located at the ABO blood group locus and a blood-group-specific analysis showed higher risk for A-positive individuals (OR=1.45, 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.75, P=1.48x10-4) and a protective effect for blood group O (OR=0.65, 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.79, P=1.06x10-5).

ConclusionsWe herein report the first robust genetic susceptibility loci for the development of respiratory failure in Covid-19.

3790,Adaptive cyclic exit strategies from lockdown to suppress COVID-19 and allow economic activity,"Many countries have applied lockdown that helped suppress COVID-19, but with devastating economic consequences. Here we propose exit strategies from lockdown that provide sustainable, albeit reduced, economic activity. We use mathematical models to show that a cyclic schedule of 4-day work and 10-day lockdown, or similar variants, can prevent resurgence of the epidemic while providing part-time employment. The cycle pushes the reproduction number R below one by reduced exposure time and by exploiting the virus latent period: those infected during work days reach peak infectiousness during lockdown days. The number of work days can be adapted in response to observations. Throughout, full epidemiological measures need to continue including hygiene, physical distancing, compartmentalization, testing and contact tracing. This conceptual framework, when combined with other interventions to control the epidemic, can offer the beginnings of predictability to many economic sectors.","Karin, O.; Bar-On, Y.

7844,"Association of country-wide coronavirus mortality with demographics, testing, lockdowns, and public wearing of masks. Update August 4, 2020.","PurposeTo determine sources of variation between countries in per-capita mortality from COVID-19 (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus).

MethodsPotential predictors of per-capita coronavirus-related mortality in 200 countries by May 9, 2020 were examined, including age, sex, obesity prevalence, temperature, urbanization, smoking, duration of infection, lockdowns, viral testing, contact tracing policies, and public mask-wearing norms and policies. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed.

ResultsIn univariate analyses, the prevalence of smoking, per-capita gross domestic product, urbanization, and colder average country temperature were positively associated with coronavirus-related mortality. In a multivariable analysis of 196 countries, the duration of infection in the country, and the proportion of the population 60 years of age or older were positively associated with per-capita mortality, while duration of mask-wearing by the public was negatively associated with mortality (all p<0.001). International travel restrictions and a lower prevalence of obesity were independently associated with mortality in a model which controlled for testing policy. Internal lockdown requirements and viral testing policies and levels were not associated with mortality. The association of contact tracing policy with mortality approached statistical significance (p=0.06). In countries with cultural norms or government policies supporting public mask-wearing, per-capita coronavirus mortality increased on average by just 15.8% each week, as compared with 62.1% each week in remaining countries.

ConclusionsSocietal norms and government policies supporting the wearing of masks by the public, as well as international travel controls, are independently associated with lower per-capita mortality from COVID-19.","Leffler, C.

20293,Model-based cellular kinetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection: different immune response modes and treatment strategies,"Increasing number in global COVID-19 cases demands for mathematical model to analyze the interaction between the virus dynamics and the response of innate and adaptive immunity. Here, based on the assumption of a weak and delayed response of the innate and adaptive immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we constructed a mathematical model to describe the dynamic processes of immune system. Integrating theoretical results with clinical COVID-19 patients data, we classified the COVID-19 development processes into three typical modes of immune responses, correlated with the clinical classification of mild & moderate, severe and critical patients. We found that the immune efficacy (the ability of host to clear virus and kill infected cells) and the lymphocyte supply (the abundance and pool of naive T and B cell) play important roles in the dynamic process and determine the clinical outcome, especially for the severe and critical patients. Furthermore, we put forward possible treatment strategies for the three typical modes of immune response. We hope our results can help to understand the dynamical mechanism of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to be useful for the treatment strategies and vaccine design.","Zhou, Z.; Zhao, Z.; Shi, S.; Wu, J.; Li, D.; Li, J.; Zhang, J.; Gui, K.; Zhang, Y.; Mei, H.; Hu, Y.; Ouyang, Q.; Li, F.",2021-01-13,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.01.11.21249562,1,Fangting Li,"School of Physics, Center for Quantitative Biology, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.11.21249562v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.11.21249562v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
6303,Effects of COVID-19 home confinement on physical activity and eating behaviour Preliminary results of the ECLB-COVID19 international online-survey,"BackgroundPublic health recommendations and governmental measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have enforced numerous restrictions on daily living including social distancing, isolation and home confinement. While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on health behaviours and lifestyle at home is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020 in seven languages to elucidate the behavioral and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions. This report presents the preliminary results from the first thousand responders on physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviours.

MethodsThirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portugese, and Slovenian languages. Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses ""before"" and ""during"" confinement conditions.

Results1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included into a general analysis. The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all intensities of PA (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall). Conversely, daily sitting time increased from 5 to 8 hours per day. Additionally, food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of meals) were more unhealthy during confinement with only alcohol binge drink decreasing significantly.

ConclusionWhile isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, our results indicate that it alters physical activity and eating behaviours in a direction that would compromise health. A more detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age groups, countries and other subgroups which will help develop bespoke interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviors manifest during the COVID-19 confinement.","Ammar, A.; Brach, M.; Trabelsi, K.; Chtourou, H.; Boukhris, O.; Masmoudi, L.; Bouaziz, B.; Bentlage, E.; How, D.; Ahmed, M.; Mueller, P.; Mueller, N.; Aloui, A.; Hammouda, O.; Paineiras-Domingos, L.

7778,Flattening the curve and the effect of atypical events on mitigation measures in Mexico: a modeling perspective,"On 23 and 30 March 2020 the Mexican Federal government implemented social distancing measures to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic. We use a mathematical model to explore atypical transmission events within the confinement period, triggered by the timing and strength of short time perturbations of social distancing. We show that social distancing measures were successful in achieving a significant reduction of the effective contact rate in the early weeks of the intervention. However, ""flattening the curve"" had an undesirable effect, since the epidemic peak was delayed too far, almost to the government preset day for lifting restrictions (01 June 2020). If the peak indeed occurs in late May or early June, then the events of childrens day and mothers day may either generate a later peak (worst case scenario), a long plateau with relatively constant but high incidence (middle case scenario) or the same peak date as in the original baseline epidemic curve, but with a post-peak interval of slower decay.","Santana-Cibrian, M.; Acuna-Zegarra, M.

20899,Adaptive immunity to human coronaviruses is widespread but low in magnitude,"Endemic human coronaviruses (hCoV) circulate worldwide but cause minimal mortality. Although seroconversion to hCoV is near ubiquitous during childhood, little is known about hCoV-specific T cell memory in adults. We quantified CD4 T cell and antibody responses to hCoV spike antigens in 42 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected individuals. T cell responses were widespread within conventional memory and cTFH compartments but did not correlate with IgG titres. SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive T cells were observed in 48% of participants and correlated with HKU1 memory. hCoV-specific T cells exhibited a CCR6+ central memory phenotype in the blood, but were enriched for frequency and CXCR3 expression in human lung draining lymph nodes. Overall, hCoV-specific humoral and cellular memory are independently maintained, with a shared phenotype existing among coronavirus-specific CD4 T cells. This understanding of endemic coronavirus immunity provides insight into the homeostatic maintenance of immune responses that are likely to be critical components of protection against SARS-CoV-2.","Tan, H.-X.; Lee, W.

10275,Forecasting COVID-19 and Analyzing the Effect of Government Interventions,"BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 epidemic, governments around the world have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical measures to control its spread. As these measures carry significant economic and humanitarian cost, it is an important topic to investigate the efficacy of different policies and accurately project the future spread under such said policies.

MethodsWe developed a novel epidemiological model, DELPHI, based on the established SEIR model, that explicitly captures government interventions, underdetection, and many other realistic effects. We estimate key biological parameters using a meta-analysis of over 190 COVID-19 research papers and fit DELPHI to over 167 geographical areas since early April. We extract the inferred government intervention effect from DELPHI.

FindingsOur epidemiological model recorded 6% and 11% two-week out-of-sample Median Absolute Percentage Error on cases and deaths, and successfully predicted the severity of epidemics in many areas (including US, UK and Russia) months before it happened. Using the extracted government response, we find mass gathering restrictions and school closings on average reduced infection rates the most, at 29.9 {+/-} 6.9% and 17.3 {+/-} 6.7%, respectively. The most stringent policy, stay-at-home, on average reduced the infection rate by 74.4 {+/-} 3.7% from baseline across countries that implemented it. We also further show that a reversal of stay-at-home policies in some countries, such as Brazil, could have disastrous results by end of July.

InterpretationOur findings highlight that among the widely implemented policies around the world, mass gathering restrictions and school closings appear to be the most effective policies in reducing the infection rate. Given the continued spread of the epidemic in many countries, we recommend these policies to continue to the extent that they can be feasibly implemented. Our results also show that under an assumption of R0 of 2.5-3 for COVID-19, stay-at-home policies appear to be the only effective policy that was widely implemented in reducing the R0 below 1. This implies that stay-at-home policies might be necessary, for at least the vulnerable population, if an uncontrolled second wave reemerges.

O_TEXTBOXResearch in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPrevious research into COVID-19 has focused on reporting estimates of epidemiological parameters of COVID-19. We conducted an extensive literature search on PubMed and MedRXiv including keywords such as ""non-pharmaceutical interventions"" and ""government interventions"". We discovered some studies reporting on the theoretical effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions in a theoretical modeling framework. There have also been a few published studies reporting on the overall effect of government interventions in the very early stages of the epidemics in various regions, such as the United States and Europe. However, there were few studies that tried to quantify the effect of each policy that was implemented, and none that the authors know of that are conducted on the global scale of this paper.

Added value of this studyAs governments continue to implement non-pharmaceutical interventions, we aim to understand the effect of different policies that have been implemented in the past. We developed a novel epidemiological model that has been continuously providing high accuracy forecasts since early April. It also provides global estimates for the effects of different policies as they have been implemented across 167 areas. The large number of areas we consider enable us to derive inference for many popular policies that have been implemented, including mass gathering restrictions, school closures, along with travel and work restrictions.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe evidence indicates that mass gathering restrictions were the most effective single policy in reducing the spread of COVID-19, followed by school closings. Stay-at-home policies greatly reduced the effective R0 and most likely enabled the effective control of the epidemics in many regions. Policy simulations suggest that many countries around the world are not yet suitable for a loosening of policy guidance, or there would be potentially severe humanitarian costs.

However, while case numbers are tracked daily4, we know little about the psychological effects of the outbreak on individuals in the moment. Here we examine the psychological and behavioral shifts over the initial stages of the outbreak in the United States in an observational longitudinal study. Through GPS phone data we find that homestay is increasing, while being at work dropped precipitously. Using regular real-time experiential surveys, we observe an overall increase in stress and mood levels which is similar in size to the weekend vs. weekday differences. As there is a significant difference between weekday and weekend mood and stress levels, this is an important decrease in wellbeing. For some, especially those affected by job loss, the mental health impact is severe.","Liu, T.; Meyerhoff, J.; Mohr, D. C.; Ungar, L. H.; Kording, K.

9362,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on lung cancer treatment scheduling,"ObjectiveCurrent pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a heavy burden on the mental and physical health of patients, regional healthcare resources, and global economic activity. Many patients with lung cancer are thought to be affected by this situation. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on lung cancer treatment scheduling.

Study designWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records of lung cancer patients who were undergoing anti-cancer treatment at the National Hospital Organization Kyoto Medical Center (600 beds) in Kyoto, Japan, between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020.

MethodsAfter the medical records were reviewed, the patients were assigned to one of two groups, depending on whether their lung cancer treatment schedule was delayed. We assessed the characteristics, types of histopathology and treatment, and the reason for the delay.

ResultsA total 15 (9.1%) patients experienced the delay of lung cancer treatment during COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with treatment delay received significantly more ICIs monotherapy than patients without treatment delay (p=0.0057). On the contrary, no patients receiving molecular target agents experienced treatment delay during COVID-19 pandemic period (p=0.0027). The treatments of most of the patients were delayed per their request.

ConclusionWe revealed 9.1% lung cancer patients suffered anxiety and requested treatment delay during COVID-19 pandemic. Oncologists should keep in mind that patient with cancer have more anxiety than we expected under special occasions such as COVID-19 pandemic.","Fujita, K.; Ito, T.; Saito, Z.; Kanai, O.; Nakatani, K.; Mio, T.",2020-06-11,Respiratory Medicine,10.1101/2020.06.09.20126995,1,Kohei Fujita,NHO Kyoto Medical Center,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.09.20126995v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.09.20126995v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1111/1759-7714.13615
13034,Quantifying threat from COVID-19 infection hazard in Primary Schools in England,"We have constructed a COVID-19 infection hazard model for the return of pupils to the 16,769 state Primary Schools in England that takes into account uncertainties in model input parameters. The basic probabilistic model estimates likely number of primary schools with one or more infected persons under three different return-to-school circumstances. Inputs to the infection hazard model are: the inventory of children, teachers and support staff; the prevalence of COVID-19 in the general community including its spatial variation, and the ratio of adult susceptibility to that of children. Three scenarios of inventory are: the counts on 1st June when schools re-opened to Nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 children, when approximately one-third of eligible children attended; a scenario assuming a full return of eligible children in those cohorts; and a return of all primary age children, scheduled for September. With a national average prevalence, we find that for the first scenario between 178 and 924 schools out of 16,769 in total (i.e. about 1% and 5.5% respectively) may have infected individuals present, expressed as a 90% credible interval. For the second scenario, the range is between 336 (2%) and 1873 (11%) schools with one (or more) infected persons, while for the third scenario the range is 661 (4%) to 3310 (20%) schools, assuming that the prevalence is the same as it was on 5th June. The range decreases to between 381 (2%) and 900 (5%) schools with an infected person if prevalence is one-quarter that of 5th June, and increases to between 2131 (13%) and 9743 (58%) schools for the situation where prevalence increases to 4 times the 5th June level. Net prevalence of COVID-19 in schools is reduced relative to the general community because of the lower susceptibility of primary age children to infection. When regional variations in prevalence and school size distribution are taken into account there is a slight decrease in number of infected schools, but the uncertainty on these projected numbers increases markedly. The probability of having an infected school in a community is proportional to the local prevalence and school size. Analysis of a scenario equivalent to a full return to school with an average national prevalence of 1 in 1700 and spatial prevalence variations, estimated from data for late June, indicates 82% of infected schools would be located in areas where prevalence exceeds the national average. The probability of having multiple infected persons in a school increases markedly in high prevalence areas. Assuming national prevalence characteristic of early June, individual, operational and societal risk will increase if schools reopen fully in September due to both increases in numbers of children and the increased challenges of sustaining mitigation measures. Comparison between incidents in primary schools with positive tests in June and July and our estimates of number of infected schools indicates at least an order of magnitude difference. The much lower number of incidents reflects several factors, including effective reduction in transmission resulting from risk mitigation measure instigated by schools.","Sparks, S. R.; Aspinall, W.

15532,"CHARACTERISTICS, MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES OF CRITICALLY ILL COVID-19 PATIENTS ADMITTED TO ICU IN HOSPITALS IN BANGLADESH: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY","Objectives: This study aimed to analyse the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of critical COVID-19 cases and investigate risk factors including comorbidities and age in relation with the clinical aftermath of COVID-19 in critical cases in Bangladesh. Methods: In this retrospective study, epidemiological and clinical characteristics, complications, laboratory results, and clinical management of the patients were studied from data obtained from 168 individuals diagnosed with an advanced prognosis of COVID-19 admitted in two hospitals in Bangladesh. Results: Individuals in the study sample contracted COVID-19 through community transmission. 56.5% (n = 95) cases died in intensive care units (ICU) during the study period. The median age was 56 years and 79.2% (n=134) were male. Typical clinical manifestation included Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related complications (79.2%), fever (54.2%) and cough (25.6%) while diabetes mellitus (52.4%), hypertension (41.1%) and heart diseases (16.7%) were the conventional comorbidities. Clinical outcomes were detrimental due to comorbidities rather than age and comorbid individuals over 50 were at more risk. In the sample, oxygen saturation was low (< 95% SpO2) in 135 patients (80.4%) and 158 (93.4%) patients received supplemental oxygen. Identical biochemical parameters were found in both deceased and surviving cases. Administration of antiviral drug Remdesivir and the glucocorticoid, Dexamethasone increased the proportion of surviving patients slightly. Conclusions: Susceptibility to developing critical illness due to COVID-19 was found more in comorbid males. These atypical patients require more clinical attention from the prospect of controlling mortality rate in Bangladesh.","Saha, A.; Ahsan, M. M.; Quader, T.-U.; Shohan, M. U.

17974,What is the relationship between validated frailty scores and mortality for adults with COVID-19 in acute hospital care? A systematic review.,"Background & aimThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate impact upon older people; the frailty construct has been used to assess risk of poor outcomes in many settings. The aim of this systematic review was to quantify the association between frailty and COVID-19 in relation to mortality in hospitalised patients.

MethodsMedline, Embase and the grey literature were searched for papers from inception to 10th September 2020. Screening (and grading) was undertaken by two reviewers according to pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Met-analysis was not possible so the result were summarised narratively.

Results2276 papers were screened resulting in 16 being included in the review. All studies were from Europe, mostly the UK; the median sample size was 308.5, mean age of participants 78.7 and 42% were female. 15/16 used the Clinical Frailty Scale; reported mortality ranged from 19 to 65%. Most, but not all studies showed an association between increasing frailty and a greater risk of dying. Two studies indicated a sub-additive relationship between frailty, COVID-19 and death, and one study showed no increase in dying.

ConclusionsThis review showed that whilst many studies have shown an association between an increased risk of COVID-19 related death with increasing frailty, other studies demonstrate a more nuanced understanding of frailty and outcomes in COVID-19 is needed. Clinicians should exert caution in placing too much emphasis on the influence of frailty alone when discussing likely prognosis in older people with COVID-19 infection.

Key pointsFrailty is being used to assess the risk of dying from COVID-19

Researchers should ensure that frailty scales are used as designed when planning and reporting future research.

Emerging studies demonstrate a complex relationship between frailty and COVID-19 related deaths

11675,"SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in adolescent students and their teachers in Saxony, Germany (SchoolCoviDD19): persistent low seroprevalence and transmission rates between May and October 2020","BackgroundSchool closures are part of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic control measures in many countries, based on the assumption that children play a similar role in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 as they do in transmitting influenza. We therefore performed a SARS-CoV-2 seropraevalence-study in students and teachers to assess their role in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

MethodsStudents grade 8-11 and their teachers in 13 secondary schools in eastern Saxony, Germany, were invited to participate in the SchoolCoviDD19 study. Blood samples were collected between May 25th and June 30th, 2020. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG were assed using chemiluminescence immunoassay technology and all samples with a positive or equivocal test result were re-tested with two additional serological tests.

Findings1538 students and 507 teachers participated in this study. The seropraevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was 0.6%. Even in schools with reported Covid-19 cases before the Lockdown of March 13th no clusters could be identified. 23/24 participants with a household history of COVID-91 were seronegative. By using a combination of three different immunoassays we could exclude 16 participants with a positive or equivocal results after initial testing.

InterpretationStudents and teachers do not play a crucial role in driving the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a low prevalence setting. Transmission in families occurs very infrequently, and the number of unreported cases is low in this age group, making school closures not appear appropriate as a strategy in this low prevalence settings.

17313,Availability of personal protective equipment and satisfaction of healthcare professionals during COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia,"Healthcare professionals (HCPs) are at the frontline in the fight against COVID-19 and are at an increased risk of becoming infected with coronavirus. Risk of infection can be minimized by use of proper personal protective equipment (PPE). This study assessed the availability of PPE and satisfaction of HCPs in six public hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted from 9th to 26th June 2020. The study hospitals included: Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Zewditu Memorial Hospital, Ghandi Memorial Hospital, Menelik II Hospital, Yekatit 12 Hospital Medical College and St. Paul Hospital Millennium Medical College. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the data and Chi-square test was used to assess the association between the groups. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with the satisfaction level of healthcare workers with regard to the availability and use of proper PPE during the current COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1,134 (92.3%) valid questionnaires from a possible 1,228 were included in the analysis. The mean ({+/-}SD) age of the participants was 30.26{+/-}6.43 year and 52.6% were females. Nurses constituted about 40% of the overall sample, followed by physicians (22.2%), interns (10.8%), midwives (10.3%) and others (16.7%). An overall shortage of PPE was reported in all study hospitals. The majority (77%) of the healthcare professionals reported that their hospital did not have adequate PPE. A critical shortage of N95 respirator was particularly reported, the self-reported availability of N95 increased from 13% to 24% before and during COVID-19, respectively. The self-reported use of N95 increased from 9% to 21% before and during COVID-19, respectively. Almost 72% of the respondents were dissatisfied with the availability of PPE in their hospital. The independent predictors of the respondents satisfaction level about PPE were male gender (adjusted OR=1.39, 95% CI:1.05-1.85), healthcare workers who reported that PPE was adequately available in the hospital (adjusted OR=7.53, 95% CI:5.08-11.16), and preparedness to provide care to COVID-19 cases (adjusted OR=1.65, 95% CI:1.22-2.12). A critical shortage of appropriate PPE both before and during COVID-19 was identified. The high level of dissatisfaction with the availability of PPE might potentially lead to a lower level of preparedness and readiness to fight against COVID-19. Therefore, urgent efforts are needed to adequately supply the healthcare facilities with appropriate PPE to alleviate the challenges.","Deressa, W.; Worku, A.; Abebe, W.; Gizaw, M.; Amogne, W.",2020-11-03,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.30.20223149,1,Wakgari Deressa,"School of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.20223149v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.20223149v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
7587,A simple criterion to design optimal nonpharmaceutical interventions for epidemic outbreaks,"To mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, much emphasis exists on implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions to keep the reproduction number below one. But using that objective ignores that some of these interventions, like bans of public events or lockdowns, must be transitory and as short as possible because of their significative economic and societal costs. Here we derive a simple and mathematically rigorous criterion for designing optimal transitory non-pharmaceutical interventions. We find that reducing the reproduction number below one is sufficient but not necessary. Instead, our criterion prescribes the required reduction in the reproduction number according to the maximum health services capacity. To explore the implications of our theoretical results, we study the non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented in 16 cities during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we estimate the minimal reduction of the contact rate in each city that is necessary to control the epidemic optimally. We also compare the optimal start of the intervention with the start of the actual interventions applied in each city. Our results contribute to establishing a rigorous methodology to guide the design of non-pharmaceutical intervention policies.","Angulo, M. T.; Castanos, F.; Moreno-Morton, R.; Velasco-Hernandez, J.

17146,Projecting the impact of behaviour and isolation interventions and super spreader events from mass gatherings and international travel on Malaysia's COVID-19 epidemic trajectories using an augmented SEIR model,"BackgroundVarious levels of lockdown implemented to contain the rapid spread of COVID-19 are not long-term solutions due to socioeconomic implications.

MethodsTo inform safe reopening, we used an augmented SEIR model to project the impact of 1) interventions and potential new epidemic trajectories arising from super spreader (SS) events and/or international travel and 2) re-introducing strong behavioural interventions on resurgence trajectories.

ResultsOur model suggests that 50% behaviour intervention effectiveness (BIE) (from enforced social distancing during lockdown, early in the epidemic), along with 50% isolation intervention effectiveness (IIE) (from increased testing and isolating infected individuals) was achieved during lockdown, which curbed COVID-19 transmission in Malaysia. Post-lockdown, BIE plays a minimal role if IIE reaches or exceeds 46.9% when other variables are held constant. At IIE of 30% and BIE of 21.3%, SS events of 5,000 active cases risks COVID-19 resurgence, with 4-year projected 12.9mn cumulative cases and 1.1mn deaths. Earlier action to increase BIE to 50% on day 98 compared to day 111, prevented an additional 21,401 recovered cases and 257 deaths.

ConclusionUntil a safe and effective vaccine is widely available, the risk of COVID-19 resurgence from large SS events warrants caution in decisions to allow for mass gatherings and regular international travel.","Ayub, A.

4785,Effectiveness and Safety of Glucocorticoids to Treat COVID-19: A Rapid Review and Meta-Analysis,"BackgroundGlucocorticoids are widely used in the treatment of various pulmonary inflammatory diseases, but they are also often accompanied by significant adverse reactions. Published guidelines point out that low dose and short duration systemic glucocorticoid therapy may be considered for patients with rapidly progressing COVID-19 while the evidence is still limited.

MethodsWe comprehensively searched electronic databases and supplemented the screening by conducting a manual search. We included RCTs and cohort studies evaluating the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoids in children and adults with COVID-19, SARS and MERS, and conducted meta-analyses of the main indicators that were identified in the studies.

ResultsOur search retrieved 23 studies, including one RCT and 22 cohort studies, with a total of 13,815 patients. In adults with COVID-19, the use of systemic glucocorticoid did not reduce mortality (RR=2.00, 95% CI: 0.69 to 5.75, I2=90.9%) or the duration of lung inflammation (WMD=-1 days, 95% CI: -2.91 to 0.91), while a significant reduction was found in the duration of fever (WMD=-3.23 days, 95% CI: -3.56 to -2.90). In patients with SARS, glucocorticoids also did not reduce the mortality (RR=1.52, 95% CI: 0.89 to 2.60, I2=84.6%), duration of fever (WMD=0.82 days, 95% CI: -2.88 to 4.52, I2=97.9%) or duration of lung inflammation absorption (WMD=0.95 days, 95% CI: -7.57 to 9.48, I2=94.6%). The use of systemic glucocorticoid therapy prolonged the duration of hospital stay in all patients (COVID-19, SARS and MERS).

ConclusionsGlucocorticoid therapy was found to reduce the duration of fever, but not mortality, duration of hospitalization or lung inflammation absorption. Long-term use of high-dose glucocorticoids increased the risk of adverse reactions such as coinfections, so routine use of systemic glucocorticoids for patients with COVID-19 cannot be recommend.","Lu, S.; Zhou, Q.; Huang, L.; Shi, Q.; Zhao, S.; Wang, Z.; Li, W.; Tang, Y.; Ma, Y.; Luo, X.; Fukuoka, T.; Ahn, H.

6787,Development and validation of the COVID-19 severity index (CSI): a prognostic tool for early respiratory decompensation,"ObjectiveThe goal of this study was to create a predictive model of early hospital respiratory decompensation among patients with COVID-19.

DesignObservational, retrospective cohort study.

SettingNine-hospital health system within the Northeastern United States.

PopulationsAdult patients ([&ge;] 18 years) admitted from the emergency department who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) up to 24 hours after initial presentation. Patients meeting criteria for respiratory critical illness within 4 hours of arrival were excluded.

Main outcome and performance measuresWe used a composite endpoint of critical illness as defined by oxygen requirement (greater than 10 L/min by low-flow device, high-flow device, non-invasive, or invasive ventilation) or death within the first 24 hours of hospitalization. We developed models predicting our composite endpoint using patient demographic and clinical data available within the first four hours of arrival. Eight hospitals (n = 932) were used for model development and one hospital (n = 240) was held out for external validation. Area under receiver operating characteristic (AU-ROC), precision-recall curves (AU-PRC), and calibration metrics were used to compare predictive models to three illness scoring systems: Elixhauser comorbidity index, qSOFA, and CURB-65.

ResultsDuring the study period from March 1, 2020 to April 27,2020, 1,792 patients were admitted with COVID-19. Six-hundred and twenty patients were excluded based on age or critical illness within the first 4 hours, yielding 1,172 patients in the final cohort. Of these patients, 144 (12.3%) met the composite endpoint within the first 24 hours. We first developed a bedside quick COVID-19 severity index (qCSI), a twelve-point scale using nasal cannula flow rate, respiratory rate, and minimum documented pulse oximetry. We then created a machine-learning gradient boosting model, the COVID-19 severity index (CSI), using twelve additional variables including inflammatory markers and liver chemistries. Both the qCSI (AU-ROC mean [95% CI]: 0.90 [0.85-0.96]) and CSI (AU-ROC: 0.91 [0.86-0.97]) outperformed the comparator models (qSOFA: 0.76 [0.69-0.85]; Elixhauser: 0.70 [0.62-0.80]; CURB-65: AU-ROC 0.66 [0.58-0.77]) on cross-validation and performed well on external validation (qCSI: 0.82, CSI: 0.76, CURB-65: 0.50, qSOFA: 0.59, Elixhauser: 0.61). We find that a qCSI score of 0-3 is associated with a less than 5% risk of critical respiratory illness, while a score of 9-12 is associated with a 57% risk of progression to critical illness.

ConclusionsA significant proportion of admitted COVID-19 patients decompensate within 24 hours of hospital presentation and these events are accurately predicted using bedside respiratory exam findings within a simple scoring system.","Haimovich, A.; Ravindra, N.

5714,Fast SARS-CoV-2 detection protocol based on RNA precipitation and RT-qPCR in nasopharyngeal swab samples,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has evolved far more aggressively in countries lacking a robust testing strategy to identify infected individuals. Given the global demand for fast and reliable diagnosis to determine the carrier individuals, a stock-out scenario for a number of essential reagents/kits used along the diagnostic process has been foreseen by many organizations. Having identified the RNA extraction step as one of the key bottlenecks, we tested several alternatives that avoid the use of commercial kits for this step. The analysis showed that 2-propanol precipitation of the viral RNA, followed by one-step RT-qPCR results in a sensitivity and specificity comparable to that provided currently by automatized systems such as the COBAS 6800 system. Therefore, this simple protocol allows SARS-CoV-2 testing independently of commercial kit providers in a time and cost-effective manner. It can be readily implemented in research and/or diagnostic laboratories worldwide, provided that patient confidentiality and researcher safety are ensured. Scaling up the testing capabilities of hospitals and research facilities will identify larger numbers of infected individuals to paint a clear picture of the COVID-19 prevalence, a pre-requisite for informed policy decision making.","Guruceaga, X.; Sierra, A.; Marino, D.; Santin, I.; Nieto-Garai, J.

10866,"The Impact of COVID-19 on Adjusted Mortality Risk in Care Homes for Older Adults in Wales, United Kingdom: A retrospective population-based cohort study for mortality in 2016-2020","BackgroundMortality in care homes has had a prominent focus during the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple and interconnected challenges face the care home sector in the prevention and management of outbreaks of COVID-19, including adequate supply of personal protective equipment, staff shortages, and insufficient or lack of timely COVID-19 testing. Care homes are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases.

AimTo analyse the mortality of older care home residents in Wales during COVID-19 lockdown and compare this across the population of Wales and the previous 4-years.

Study Design and SettingWe used anonymised Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and administrative data from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank to create a cross-sectional cohort study. We anonymously linked data for Welsh residents to mortality data up to the 14th June 2020.

MethodsWe calculated survival curves and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of mortality. We adjusted hazard ratios for age, gender, social economic status and prior health conditions.

ResultsSurvival curves show an increased proportion of deaths between 23rd March and 14th June 2020 in care homes for older people, with an adjusted HR of 1{middle dot}72 (1{middle dot}55, 1{middle dot}90) compared to 2016. Compared to the general population in 2016-2019, adjusted care home mortality HRs for older adults rose from 2{middle dot}15 (2{middle dot}11,2{middle dot}20) in 2016-2019 to 2{middle dot}94 (2{middle dot}81,3{middle dot}08) in 2020.

ConclusionsThe survival curves and increased HRs show a significantly increased risk of death in the 2020 study periods.","Hollinghurst, J.; Lyons, J.; Fry, R.; Akbari, A.; Gravenor, M.; Watkins, A.; Verity, F.; Lyons, R.

13564,"Use, reuse or discard: quantitatively defined variance in N95 respirator integrity following vaporized hydrogen peroxide decontamination during the COVID-19 pandemic","BackgroundCOVID-19 has stretched the ability of many institutions to supply needed personal protective equipment, especially N95 respirators. N95 decontamination and reuse programs provide one potential solution to this problem. Unfortunately, a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of decontamination on the integrity of various N95 models using a quantitative fit test (QTFT) approach is lacking.

Aims1) To investigate the effects of up to eight rounds of vaporized H2O2 (VHP) decontamination on the integrity of N95 respirators currently in use in a hospital setting. 2) To examine if N95 respirators worn by one user can adapt to the face shape of a second user with no compromise of integrity following VHP decontamination.

MethodsThe PortaCount Pro+ Respirator Fit Tester Model 8038 was used to quantitatively define the integrity, measured by fit, of N95 respirators following decontamination with VHP.

FindingsThere was an observable downward trend in the integrity of Halyard Fluidshield 46727 N95 respirators throughout eight cycles of decontamination with VHP. The integrity of 3M 1870 N95 respirators was significantly reduced after the respirator was worn, decontaminated with VHP, and then quantitatively fit tested on a second user. Furthermore, we uncovered inconsistencies between qualitative fit test and QTFT results that may have strong implications on the fit testing method used by institutions.

ConclusionsOur data revealed variability in the integrity of different N95 models after VHP decontamination and exposed potential limitations of N95 decontamination and reuse programs.","Levine, C.; Grady, C.; Block, T.; Hurley, H.; Russo, R.; Peixoto, B.; Frees, A.; Ruiz, A.; Alland, D.",2020-08-21,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.18.20177071,1,David Alland,Rutgers University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20177071v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20177071v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.jhin.2020.10.007

O_LIHospitalization+: composite outcome of hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or death
C_LIO_LIICU+: composite outcome of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or death
C_LIO_LIDeath
C_LI

We assessed the resulting models discrimination using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves and reported the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

ResultsWe included 2709 cases from 59 countries (mean age 41.2 years [s.d. 18], 50.2% male). A total of 633 (24%) were hospitalized, 137 (5%) were admitted to the ICU or intubated, and 69 (3%) died. 2009 patients comprised the training set and 700 the test set.

The models demonstrated excellent discrimination, with a test set AUC (95% CI) of 0.79 (0.75, 0.83) for Hospitalization+, 0.88 (0.82, 0.95) for ICU+, and 0.94 (0.89, 0.99) for Death. Age, comorbidities, corticosteroid use, and male gender were associated with higher risk of death, while use of biologic therapies was associated with a lower risk.

Conclusions and RelevancePrognostic models can effectively predict who is at higher risk for COVID-19-related adverse outcomes in a population of IBD patients. A free online risk calculator (https://covidibd.org/covid-19-risk-calculator/) is available for healthcare providers to facilitate discussion of risks due to COVID-19 with IBD patients. The tool numerically and visually summarizes the patients probabilities of adverse outcomes and associated CIs. Helping physicians identify their highest-risk patients will be important in the coming months as cases rise in the US and worldwide. This tool can also serve as a model for risk stratification in other chronic diseases.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow well can a multivariable risk model predict the risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, or death due to COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?

FindingsMultivariable prediction models developed using data from an international voluntary registry of IBD patients and available for use online (https://covidibd.org/) have very good discrimination for predicting hospitalization (Test set AUC 0.79) and excellent discrimination for ICU admission (Test set AUC 0.88) and death (Test set AUC 0.94). The models were developed with a training sample of 2009 cases and validated in an independent test sample of 700 cases comprised of a random sub-sample of cases and all cases entered in the registry during a one-month period after model development.

MeaningThis risk prediction model may serve as an effective tool for healthcare providers to facilitate conversations about COVID-19-related risks with IBD patients.","Sperger, J.; Shah, K.

19763,"A Systematic Review of the Incubation Period of SARS-CoV-2: The Effects of Age, Biological Sex, and Location on Incubation Period","A systematic review of the incubation period of COVID-19 was compiled and analyzed from 21 quantitative studies. We investigated the incubation period of COVID-19 with regard to age, biological sex, location, and severity of the disease. Based on the data extracted, we report an overall mean and median incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 of 5.894 days and 5.598 days, respectively. The incubation period did not statistically vary for biological sex or age, but some studies suggest a longer incubation period in the young and elderly. Cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei Province of China may have a shorter incubation period for COVID-19 but the shorter incubation period may be due to an increase in viral load. In studying coronavirus strains such as SARS and MERS, researchers have discovered an inverse relationship between incubation period length and virus severity. Taking into consideration that SARS-CoV-2 is part of the beta-coronavirus family, as well as the study mentioned above, we suggest that people who experience more severe disease due to SARS-CoV-2 may have a shorter incubation period.","Daley, C.; Fydenkevez, M.; Ackerman-Morris, S.",2020-12-24,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.12.23.20248790,1,Shari Ackerman-Morris,Wheaton College,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.23.20248790v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.23.20248790v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
1976,"The cross-sectional study of hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients in Xiangyang, Hubei province","ObjectiveTo describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalized patients and to offer suggestions to the urgent needs of COVID-19 prevention, diagnosis and treatment.

MethodsWe included 102 confirmed COVID-19 cases hospitalized in Xiangyang No.1 peoples hospital, Hubei, China until Feb 9th, 2020. Demographic data, laboratory findings and chest computed tomographic (CT) images were obtained and analyzed.

FindingsAll cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, including 52 males and 50 females with a mean age of 50.38 years (SD 16.86). Incubation time ranged from one to twenty days with a mean period of 8.09 days (SD 4.99). Fever (86[84.3%] of 102 patients), cough (58[57%]), fatigue (28[27%]), shortness of breath (24[23%]), diarrhea (15[15%]), expectoration (13[12%]), inappetence (11[10%]) were common clinical manifestations. We observed a decreased blood leukocyte count and lymphopenia in 21 (20.6%) and 56 (54.9%) patients, respectively. There were 66 (68%) of 97 patients with elevated C-reactive protein levels and 49 (57.6%) of 85 with increased erythrocytes sedimentation rate. Higher levels of procalcitonin and ferritin were observed in 19 (25.3%) of 75 and 12 (92.3%) of 13 patients, respectively. Eight patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), six developed respiratory failure, three had multiple organ failure and three died. The cumulative positivity rate over three rounds of real-time RT-PCR was 96%. One-hundred patients were found with typical radiological abnormalities in two rounds of chest CT scans, indicating a 98% consistency with real-time RT-PCR results.

InterpretationMost COVID-19 patients in Xiangyang were secondary cases without sex difference, and the rate of severe case and death was low. Middle-to-old-age individuals were more susceptible to the virus infection and the subsequent development of severe/fatal consequences. The average incubation period was longer among our patients. We recommend prolonging the quarantine period to three weeks. Three times real-time RT-PCR plus two times CT scans is a practical clinical diagnosis strategy at present and should be used to increase the accuracy of diagnosis, thereby controlling the source of infection more effectively.","Ai, J.; Chen, J.; Wang, Y.; Liu, X.; Fan, W.; Qu, G.; Zhang, M.; Pei, S.

16439,A Neanderthal OAS1 Isoform Protects Against COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity: Results from Mendelian Randomization and Case-Control Studies,"Proteins detectable in peripheral blood may influence COVID-19 susceptibility or severity. However, understanding which circulating proteins are etiologically involved is difficult because their levels may be influenced by COVID-19 itself and are also subject to confounding factors. To identify circulating proteins influencing COVID-19 susceptibility and severity we undertook a large-scale two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study, since this study design can rapidly scan hundreds of circulating proteins and reduces bias due to reverse causation and confounding. We identified genetic determinants of 931 circulating proteins in 28,461 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected individuals, retaining only single nucleotide polymorphism near the gene encoding the circulating protein. We found that a standard deviation increase in OAS1 levels was associated with reduced COVID-19 death or ventilation (N = 4,336 cases / 623,902 controls; OR = 0.54, P = 7x10-8), COVID-19 hospitalization (N = 6,406 / 902,088; OR = 0.61, P = 8x10-8) and COVID-19 susceptibility (N = 14,134 / 1,284,876; OR = 0.78, P = 8x10-6). Results were consistent in multiple sensitivity analyses. We then measured OAS1 levels in 504 patients with repeated plasma samples (N=1039) with different COVID-19 outcomes and found that increased OAS1 levels in a non-infectious state were associated with protection against very severe COVID-19, hospitalization and susceptibility. Further analyses suggested that a Neanderthal isoform of OAS1 affords this protection. Thus, evidence from MR and a case-control study supported a protective role for OAS1 in COVID-19 outcomes. Available medicines, such as phosphodiesterase-12 inhibitors, increase OAS1 and could be explored for their effect on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.","Zhou, S.; Butler-Laporte, G.; Nakanishi, T.; Morrison, D.; Afilalo, J.; Afilalo, M.; Laurent, L.; Pietzner, M.; Kerrison, N.; Zhao, K.; Brunet-Ratnasingham, E.; Henry, D.; Kimchi, N.; Afrasiabi, Z.; Rezk, N.; Bouab, M.; Guzman, C.; Petitjean, L.; Xue, X.; Tselios, C.; Vulesevic, B.; Adeleye, O.; Abdullah, T.; Almamlouk, N.; Chen, Y.; Durand, M.; Chasse, M.; Normark, J.; Thysell, E.; Frithiof, R.; Lipcsey, M.; Hultstrom, M.; Paterson, C.; Pollak, M.; Zeberg, H.; Greenwood, C.

12386,Are Cloth Masks a Substitute to Medical Masks in reducing transmission and contamination? A Systematic Review.,"During the COVID-19 pandemic the use of cloth masks has increased dramatically due to the shortage of medical masks. However, the efficiency of this material is controversial. We aimed to investigate the efficiency of cloth masks in reducing transmission and contamination by droplets and aerosols for the general population and healthcare workers. Electronic databases were searched without year or language restrictions. Clinical and laboratorial studies were included. The risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using an adapted quality checklist for laboratory-based studies. ROBINS-I tool and Cochrane RoB 2.0 were used to evaluate non-randomized (n-RCT) and randomized clinical trials (RCT), respectively. The quality of the evidence was assessed through GRADE tool. From the eleven studies selected, eight were laboratory-based studies, one non-randomized and one RCT supported by laboratory data. Between the evaluated fabrics only three presented a filtration efficiency >90%. Hybrid of cotton/chiffon (95%CI 95.2 to 98.8), hybrid of cotton/silk (95%CI 92.2 to 95.8) and cotton quilt (95%CI 94.2 to 97.8). A meta-analysis was not feasible due to a high methodological heterogeneity. The overall quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Despite the lower efficiency compared to medical masks, laboratorial results may underestimate the efficiency of cloth masks in real life. Cloth mask efficiency is higher when made of hybrid fabrics (cotton/chiffon, cotton/silk) and cotton quilt, mainly with multiple layers. In pandemic situations any measure that can contribute to source control at the population level can have a beneficial effect. However, cloth masks are not recommended for healthcare workers.","Santos, M.; Torres, D.; Cardoso, P.

An early and accurate identification of high-risk patients in the course of the actual COVID-19 pandemic is vital for planning and for making proper use of available resources.

ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to identify the key variables to create a predictive model that could be used effectively for triage.

MethodsA narrative literature review of 651 articles was conducted to assess clinical, laboratory and imaging findings of COVID-19 confirmed cases. After screening, 10 articles met the inclusion criteria and a list of suggested variables was gathered. A modified Delphi process analysis was performed to consult experts in order to generate a final list of variables for the creation of the predictive model.

ResultsThe modified Delphi process analysis identified 44 predictive variables that were used for building a severity prediction score, the COVID-19 Severity Index.

8995,Dynamics of COVID-19 under social distancing measures are driven by transmission network structure,"In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions, social distancing is being used worldwide to curb the spread of COVID-19. The impact of these measures has been inconsistent, with some regions rapidly nearing disease elimination and others seeing delayed peaks or nearly flat epidemic curves. Here we build a stochastic epidemic model to examine the effects of COVID-19 clinical progression and transmission network structure on the outcomes of social distancing interventions. Our simulations show that long delays between the adoption of control measures and observed declines in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths occur in many scenarios. We find that the strength of within-household transmission is a critical determinant of success, governing the timing and size of the epidemic peak, the rate of decline, individual risks of infection, and the success of partial relaxation measures. The structure of residual external connections, driven by workforce participation and essential businesses, interacts to determine outcomes. We suggest limited conditions under which the formation of household ""bubbles"" can be safe. These findings can improve future predictions of the timescale and efficacy of interventions needed to control second waves of COVID-19 as well as other similar outbreaks, and highlight the need for better quantification and control of household transmission.

Author SummarySocial distancing is the main tool used to control COVID-19, and involves reducing contacts that could potentially transmit infection with strategies like school closures, work-from-home policies, mask-wearing, or lockdowns. These measures have been applied around the world, but in situations where they have suppressed infections, the effect has not been immediate or consistent. In this study we use a mathematical model to simulate the spread and control of COVID-19, tracking the different settings of person-to-person contact (e.g. household, school, workplace) and the different clinical stages an infected individual may pass through before recovery or death. We find that there are often long delays between when strong social distancing policies are adopted and when cases, hospitalizations, and deaths peak and begin to decline. Moreover, we find that the amount of transmission that happens within versus outside the household is critical to determining when social distancing can be effective and the delay until the epidemic peak. We show how the interaction between unmitigated households spread and residual external connections due to essential activities impacts individual risk and population infection levels. These results can be used to better predict the impact of future interventions to control COVID-19 or similar outbreaks","Nande, A.; Adlam, B.; Sheen, J.; Levy, M. Z.; Hill, A.

9895,Does Gender or Religion Contribute to the Risk of COVID-19 in Hospital Doctors?,"The novel coronavirus pandemic is posing significant challenges to healthcare workers (HCWs) in adjusting to redeployed clinical settings and enhanced risk to their own health. Studies suggest a variable impact of COVID-19 based on factors such as age, gender, comorbidities and ethnicity. Workplace measures such as personal protective equipment (PPE), social distancing (SD) and avoidance of exposure for the vulnerable, mitigate this risk. This online questionnaire-based study explored the impact of gender and religion in addition to workplace measures associated with risk of COVID-19 in hospital doctors in acute and mental health institutions in the UK.

The survey had 1206 responses, majority (94%) from BAME backgrounds. A quarter of the respondents had either confirmed or suspected COVID-19, a similar proportion reported inadequate PPE and 2/3 could not comply with SD. One third reported being reprimanded in relation to PPE or avoidance of risk. In univariate analysis, age over 50 years, being female, Muslim and inability to avoid exposure in the workplace was associated with risk of COVID-19. On multivariate analysis, inadequate PPE remained an independent predictor with a twofold (OR 2.29, (CI - 1.22-4.33), p=0.01) risk of COVID-19.

This study demonstrates that PPE, SD and workplace measures to mitigate risk remain important for reducing risk of COVID-19 in hospital doctors. Gender and religion did not appear to be independent determinants. It is imperative that employers consolidate risk reduction measures and foster a culture of safety to encourage employees to voice any safety concerns.

18852,Racial and Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19 Infection and Mortality in the United States: A state-wise update,"ObjectivesTo evaluate COVID-19 infection and mortality in ethnic and racial sub-groups across all states in the United States.

MethodsPublicly available data from ""The COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic"" was accessed between 09/09/2020 and 09/14/2020. For each state and the District of Columbia, % infection, % death, % population proportion for subgroups of race (African American (AA), Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, (AI/AN) and White), and ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino, and non-Hispanic), were recorded. Absolute and relative excess infection (AEI and REI) and mortality (AEM and REM) were computed as absolute and relative difference between % infection or % mortality and % population proportion for each state. Median (IQR) REI is provided below.

ResultsThe Hispanic population had a median of 158% higher COVID-19 infection relative to their % population proportion (median REI 158%, [IQR: 100% to 200%]). This was followed by AA, with 50% higher COVID-19 infection relative to their % population proportion (median REI, 50% [IQR 25% to 100%]). The AA population had the most disproportionate mortality with a median of 46% higher mortality than % population proportion, (median REM 46% [IQR, 18% to 66%]). Disproportionate impact of COVID-19 was also seen in AI/AN and Asian population with [&ge;]100% excess infections than % population proportion seen in 35 states for Hispanic, 14 states for AA, 9 states for AIAN, and 7 states for Asian populations. There was no disproportionate impact in the white population in any state.

ConclusionsRacial/ethnic minorities (AA, Hispanic, AIAN and Asian populations) are disproportionately affected by COVID 19 infection and mortality across the nation. These findings underscore the potential role of social determinants of health in explaining the disparate impact of SARS-CoV-2 on vulnerable demographic groups, as well as the opportunity to improve outcomes in chronically marginalized populations.","Xian, Z.; Saxena, A.; Javed, Z.; Jordan, J.

11925,Humoral Response Dynamics Following Infection with SARS-CoV-2,"IntroductionSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific antibodies have been shown to neutralize the virus in-vitro. Understanding antibody dynamics following SARS-CoV-2 infection is therefore crucial. Sensitive measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is also vital for large seroprevalence surveys which inform government policies and public health interventions. However, rapidly waning antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection could jeopardize the sensitivity of serological testing on which these surveys depend.

MethodsThis prospective cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 humoral dynamics in a central London hospital analyzed 137 serial samples collected from 67 participants seropositive to SARS-CoV-2 by the Meso-Scale Discovery assay. Antibody titers were quantified to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N), spike (S-)protein and the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) of the S-protein. Titers were log-transformed and a multivariate log-linear model with time-since-infection and clinical variables was fitted by Bayesian methods.

ResultsThe mean estimated half-life of the N-antibody was 52 days (95% CI 42-65). The S- and RBD-antibody had significantly longer mean half-lives of 81 days (95% CI 61-111) and 83 days (95% CI 55-137) respectively. An ACE-2-receptor competition assay demonstrated significant correlation between the S and RBD-antibody titers and ACE2-receptor blocking in-vitro. The time-to-a-negative N-antibody test for 50% of the seropositive population was predicted to be 195 days (95% CI 163-236).

DiscussionAfter SARS-CoV-2 infection, the predicted half-life of N-antibody was 52 days with 50% of seropositive participants becoming seronegative to this antibody at 195 days. Widely used serological tests that depend on the N-antibody will therefore significantly underestimate the prevalence of infection following the majority of infections.

Significance statementWe believe that our study has significant and urgent public health and translational impact. Firstly, our findings demonstrate that the half-life of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein antibody is only 52 days. This has immediate and important implications for large-scale seroprevalence surveys, government policy and mathematical modelling predictions which rely on serological tests that target this antibody. Secondly, the slower decay of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody identified in this study makes assays to the spike protein a more reliable target for serological assays in the longer term. We demonstrate a strong positive linear correlation between spike/RBD antibody and ACE-2 receptor binding in vitro. Our findings are therefore likely to reflect the time to loss of a functional antibody response in SARS-CoV-2.

19076,Effects of photobiomodulation therapy combined with static magnetic field (PBMT-sMF) in patients with severe COVID-19 requiring intubation: a pragmatic randomized placebo-controlled trial,"BackgroundPhotobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) when used isolated or combined with static magnetic field (PBMT-sMF) has been proven benefits on skeletal muscle increasing performance and reducing fatigue, increasing oxygen saturation, and modulating inflammatory process. However, it is unknown whether the effects observed with this therapy on respiratory muscles will be similar to the effects previously observed on skeletal muscles.

ObjectiveWe aimed to investigate whether PBMT-sMF is able to decrease the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to reduce the mortality rate of patients with severe COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, increasing the respiratory function and modulating the inflammatory process.

MethodsWe conducted a prospectively registered, pragmatic, triple-blinded (patients, therapists and outcome assessors), randomized, placebo-controlled trial of PBMT-sMF in patients with severe COVID-19, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, admitted to the ICU. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either PBMT-sMF (6 sites at the lower thorax - 189 J total, and 2 sites at the neck area - 63 J total) or placebo PBMT-sMF daily during all the ICU stay. The primary outcome was length of stay in the ICU defined by either discharge or death. The secondary outcomes were survival rate, muscle function of diaphragm, change in blood tests, change in mechanical ventilation parameters and change in arterial blood gas analysis.

ResultsA total of 30 patients underwent randomization (with 15 assigned to PBMT-sMF and 15 to placebo) and were analyzed. The length of stay in the ICU for the placebo group was 23.06 days while for the PBMT-sMF group was 16.26. However, there was no statistically difference between groups for the length of stay in the ICU (mean difference - MD = - 6.80; 95% CI = - 18.71 to 5.11). Regarding the secondary outcomes were observed statistically differences in favor of PBMT-sMF for diaphragm thickness, fraction of inspired oxygen, partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio, C-reactive protein, lymphocytes count, and hemoglobin (p<0.05).

ConclusionAmong patients with severe COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, PBMT-sMF was not statistically different than placebo to the length of stay in the ICU. However, it is important to highlight that our sample size was underpowered to detect statistical differences to the primary outcome.

16285,SARS-CoV-2 waves in Europe: A 2-stratum SEIRS model solution,"In order to design actionable SARS-CoV-2 strategies, we extended the SEIRS model to support stratified isolation levels for healthy <60 and vulnerable individuals. At first, we forced isolation levels to be uniform, showing that daily deaths curves of all metropolitan areas in the analysis can be fitted using homogeneous Ro=3.3. In the process, we established the possibility that an extremely short infectiousness period of 2 days coupled with 5 days exposure may be responsible for the multiple deaths valleys observed during the weeks following lockdowns. Regardless of the infectiousness period, we realized that is possible to infer non-uniform isolation levels for healthy <60 and vulnerable by forcing the model to match the <60 to >60 age serology ratio reported in seroprevalence studies. Since the serology ratio is more robust than absolute values, we argue immunity level estimations made in this way (Madrid 41%; Catalonia 23%; Brussels 49%; and Stockholm 62%) are closer to reality. In locations where we didnt find reliable serology, we performed immunity estimations assuming Spains serology ratio (Paris: 23%; London: 33%). We predict that no location can return to normal life without having a second wave (albeit in Stockholm a smaller one). We searched what isolation values allow to return to normal life in 90 days minimizing final deaths, shockingly all found isolations for healthy <60 were negative (i.e. coronavirus parties minimize final deaths). Then, assuming an ideal 1-day long vaccination campaign with a 77% efficacy vaccine, we compared predicted final deaths of those 90-day strategies for all possible vaccination dates with a 180-day long vaccine waiting strategy that imposes 0.40 mandatory isolation to healthy <60 and results in 0.65 isolation to vulnerable. We found that 180-day of mandatory isolations to healthy <60 (i.e. schools and workplaces closed) produces more final deaths if the vaccination date is later than (Madrid: Feb 23 2021; Catalonia: Dec 28 2020; Brussels Apr 25 2021; Paris: Jan 14 2021; London: Jan 22 2021). We also modeled how average isolation levels change the probability of getting infected for a single individual that isolates differently than average. That led us to realize disease damages to third parties due to virus spreading can be calculated and to postulate that an individual has the right to avoid mandatory isolation during epidemics (SARS-CoV-2 or any other) if these damages can be covered with a novel proposed isolation exemption insurance policy. As secondary findings in Appendix III we hypothesize that an early D614 like strain wave might be the cause of low mortality in Asia, and show the negligible reduction of HIT due to heterogeneity. Finally we conclude that our 2-stratum SEIRS model is suitable to predict SARS-CoV-2 epidemic behavior and can be used to minimize covid-19 disease and isolations related damages.

We calculate and add costs of lost productivity and costs of mortality measured through the value of statistical life. We find that the aggressive approach which involves strict suppression measures and a drastic reduction of economic activity for three months with extensive testing and case tracking afterwards results in the lowest total costs for the society.

13257,Frontline healthcare workers' knowledge and perception of COVID-19 and willingness to work during the pandemic in Nepal: a nationwide cross-sectional web-based study,"BackgroundThe health sectors effectiveness during a pandemic primarily depends on the availability, knowledge, skills, perceptions, and motivations of frontline healthcare workers. In this study, we aimed to investigate the contextual factors associated with the knowledge, perceptions, and the willingness of frontline healthcare workers to work during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal.

MethodsA total of 1051 frontline health-workers from all seven Nepalese provinces were included in this web-based cross-sectional study, which was conducted in May 2020. Using a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire, we collected information on knowledge, perceptions, and the willingness of frontline healthcare workers to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to identify independent associations between predictors and outcome variables.

ResultsOf the 1051 frontline health-workers, 17.2% were found to have inadequate knowledge on COVID-19, 63.6% reported unsatisfactory perceptions of government response, and 35.9% showed an unwillingness to work during the pandemic. Health workers at local health facilities (AOR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.17-0.68) and those with chronic diseases were less likely to have adequate knowledge of COVID-19. Nurses (AOR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.38-3.18), health-workers from Karnali Province (AOR: 2.62; 95% CI: 1.52-4.53), and those who had adequate knowledge of COVID-19 (AOR: 3.86; 95% CI: 2.51-6.16) were more likely to have satisfactory perception towards government response to COVID-19. In addition, laboratory-workers, health workers from Karnali province, and those with adequate knowledge (AOR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.27-2.58) were more likely to work during the COVID-19 pandemic.

ConclusionsWe concluded that frontline healthcare workers have some gaps in knowledge-related to COVID-19; about two-thirds of them had a negative perception of government response, and nearly one-third of them were unwilling to work. These observations demonstrate that prompt actions are required to improve health-worker knowledge of COVID-19, address negative perceptions to government responses, and motivate them to provide healthcare services during the pandemic.","Upadhyaya, D.

5628,COVID-19-induced acute respiratory failure: an exacerbation of organ-specific autoimmunity?,"BackgroundUnderstanding the pathophysiology of respiratory failure (ARDS) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is of utmost importance for the development of therapeutic strategies and identification of risk factors. Since we observed clinical and histopathological similarities between COVID-19 and lung manifestations of connective tissue disease (CTD-ILD) in our clinical practice, aim of the present study is to analyze a possible role of autoimmunity in SARS-CoV-2-associated respiratory failure.

MethodsIn this prospective, single-center trial, we enrolled 22 consecutive patients with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized in March and April, 2020. We performed high-resolution computed tomography (HR-CT) and full laboratory testing including autoantibody (AAB) screening (anti-ANA, SS-B/La, Scl-70, Jo-1, CENP-B, PM-Scl). Transbronchial biopsies as well as post mortem tissue samples were obtained from 3 and 2 cases, respectively, and subsequent histopathologic analysis with special emphasis on characterization of interstitial lung disease was performed.

ResultsTwelve of 22 patients (54.5%) were male and median age was 69.0 (range: 28-88). 11 (50.0%) patients had to be undergo intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. Intubation with ventilation was required in 10/22 cases (46%). Median follow-up was 26 days. Clinical and serological parameters were comparable to previous reports. Radiological and histopathological findings were highly heterogeneous including patterns reminiscent of CTD-ILD. AAB titers [&ge;]1:100 were detected in 10/11 (91.9%) COVID-19 patients who required ICU treatment, but in 4/11 (36.4%) patients with mild clinical course (p=0.024). Patients with AABs tended to require invasive ventilation and showed significantly more severe complications (64.3% vs. 12.5%, p=0.031). Overall COVID-19-related mortality was 18.2% among hospitalized patients at our institution.

ConclusionOur findings point out serological, radiological and histomorphological similarities between COVID-19-associated ARDS and acute exacerbation of CTD-ILD. While the exact mechanism is still unknown, we postulate that SARS-CoV-2 infection might trigger or simulate a form of organ-specific autoimmunity in predisposed patients. The detection of autoantibodies might identify patients who profit from immunosuppressive therapy to prevent the development of respiratory failure.","Gagiannis, D.; Steinestel, J.; Hackenbroch, C.; Hannemann, M.; Umathum, V.

Capillary blood self-sampling and postage to laboratories for analysis could provide a reliable alternative. Two-hundred and nine matched venous and capillary blood samples were obtained from thirty nine participants and analysed using a COVID-19 IgG ELISA to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Thirty seven out of thirty eight participants were able to self-collect an adequate sample of capillary blood ([&ge;]50 l). Using plasma from venous blood collected in lithium heparin as the reference standard, matched capillary blood samples, collected in lithium heparin-treated tubes and on filter paper as dried blood spots, achieved a Cohen's kappa coefficient of >0.88 (near-perfect agreement).

6288,Assessment of Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine Safety Profiles: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"BackgroundRecently, chloroquine (CQ) and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have emerged as potential antiviral and immunomodulatory options for the treatment of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To examine the safety profiles of these medications, we systematically evaluated the adverse events (AEs) of these medications from published randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

MethodsWe systematically searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, and the ClinicalTrials.gov for all the RCTs comparing CQ or HCQ with placebo or other active agents, published before March 31, 2020. The random-effects or fixed-effects models were used to pool the risk estimates relative ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the outcomes.

ResultsThe literature search yielded 23 and 17 studies for CQ and HCQ, respectively, that satisfied our inclusion criteria. Of these studies, we performed meta-analysis on the ones that were placebo-controlled, which included 6 studies for CQ and 14 studies for HCQ. We did not limit our analysis to published reports involving viral treatment alone; data also included the usage of either CQ or HCQ for the treatment of other diseases. The trials for the CQ consisted of a total of 2,137 participants (n=1,077 CQ, n=1,060 placebo), while the trials for HCQ involved 1,096 participants (n=558 HCQ and n=538 placebo). The overall mild or total AEs were statistically higher comparing CQ or HCQ to placebo. The AEs were further categorized into four groups and analyses revealed that neurologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and ophthalmic AEs were higher in participants taking CQ compared to placebo. Although this was not evident in HCQ treated groups, further analyses suggested that there were more AEs attributed to other organ system that were not included in the categorized meta-analyses. Additionally, meta-regression analyses revealed that total AEs was affected by dosage for the CQ group.

ConclusionsTaken together, we found that participants taking either CQ or HCQ have more AEs than participants taking placebo. Precautionary measures should be taken when using these drugs to treat COVID-19.","Ren, L.; Xu, W.; Overton, J. L.; Yu, S.; Chiamvimonvat, N.; Thai, P.

7081,FORECASTING COVID-19 PANDEMIC: A DATA-DRIVEN ANALYSIS,"In this paper, a new Susceptible-Exposed-Symptomatic Infectious-Asymptomatic Infectious-Quarantined-Hospitalized-Recovered-Dead (SEIDIUQHRD) deterministic compartmental model has been proposed and calibrated for describing the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). A calibration process is executed through the solution of an inverse problem with the help of a Trust-Region-Reflective algorithm, used to determine the best parameter values that would fit the model response. The purpose of this study is to give a tentative prediction of the epidemic peak for Russia, Brazil, India and Bangladesh which could become the next COVID-19 hotspots in no time. Based on the publicly available epidemiological data from late January until 10 May, it has been estimated that the number of daily new symptomatic infectious cases for the above mentioned countries could reach the peak around the beginning of June with the peak size of ~ 15, 774 symptomatic infectious cases in Russia, ~ 26,449 cases in Brazil, ~ 9, 504 cases in India and ~ 2, 209 cases in Bangladesh. Based on our analysis, the estimated value of the basic reproduction number (R0) as of May 11, 2020 was found to be ~ 4.234 in Russia, ~ 5.347 in Brazil, ~ 5.218 in India, ~ 4.649 in the United Kingdom and ~ 3.5 in Bangladesh. Moreover, with an aim to quantify the uncertainty of our model parameters, Latin hypercube sampling-partial rank correlation coefficient (LHS-PRCC) which is a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method is applied which elucidates that, for Russia, the recovery rate of undetected asymptomatic carriers, the rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined and the transition rate from quarantined class to susceptible class are the most influential parameters, whereas the rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined and the inverse of the COVID-19 incubation period are highly sensitive parameters in Brazil, India, Bangladesh and the United Kingdom which could significantly affect the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. Our analysis also suggests that relaxing social distancing restrictions too quickly could exacerbate the epidemic outbreak in the above mentioned countries.","Nabi, K.

14688,Model-informed COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies by age and serostatus,"When a vaccine for COVID-19 becomes available, limited initial supply will raise the question of how to prioritize the available doses and thus underscores the need for transparent, evidence-based strategies that relate knowledge of, and uncertainty in, disease transmission, risk, vaccine efficacy, and existing population immunity. Here, we employ a model-informed approach to vaccine prioritization that evaluates the impact of prioritization strategies on cumulative incidence and mortality and accounts for population factors such as age, contact structure, and seroprevalence, and vaccine factors including imperfect and age-varying efficacy. This framework can be used to evaluate and compare existing strategies, and it can also be used to derive an optimal prioritization strategy to minimize mortality or incidence. We find that a transmission-blocking vaccine should be prioritized to adults ages 20-49y to minimize cumulative incidence and to adults over 60y to minimize mortality. Direct vaccination of adults over 60y minimizes mortality for vaccines that do not block transmission. We also estimate the potential benefit of using individual-level serological tests to redirect doses to only seronegative individuals, improving the marginal impact of each dose. We argue that this serology-informed vaccination approach may improve the efficiency of vaccination efforts while partially addressing existing inequities in COVID-19 burden and impact.","Bubar, K.

2730,Assessing the Global Tendency of COVID-19 Outbreak,"COVID-19 is now widely spreading around the world as a global pandemic. In this report, we estimated the global tendency of COVID-19 and analyzed the associated global epidemic risk, given that the status quo is continued without further measures being taken.

Based on official data of confirmed and recovered cases until May 21, 2020, the results showed that the global R0, excluding China, was estimated to be 2.76 (95% CI: 2.57 - 2.95). The United States, Germany, Italy, and Spain have peak values over 100,000. Using dynamical model and cluster analysis, we partition the globe into four regional epicenters of the outbreak: Southeast Asia extending southward to Oceania, the Middle East, Western Europe, and North America. Among them, Western Europe would become the major center of the outbreak. The peak values in Germany, Italy, and Spain were estimated to be 228,000, 291,000, and 298,000, respectively. Based on the current control measures by May 21, 2020, the peak value in the United States will reach 2,114,000. The cumulative number of 51 mainly researched countries patients might finally attain 6,542,000 (95% CI: 4,772,000 - 40,735,000). We also estimated the diagnosis rate, recovery rate, and infection degree of each country or region, and used clustering algorithm to retrieve countries or regions with similar epidemic characteristics.

Methods: Outpatients who had recently been diagnosed with COVID-19 or were presenting with suspected COVID-19 were asked to have a nasopharyngeal swab collected and provide at least one self-collected sample type. A portion of participants were also asked about sample acceptability. Samples underwent molecular testing using multiple assays. Saline mouth rinse/gargle and saliva samples were tested daily at time zero, day one, and day 2 to assess nucleic acid stability at room temperature. Results: 50 participants (aged 4 to 71 years) were included; of these, 40 had at least one positive sample and were included in the primary sample yield analysis. Saline mouth rinse/gargle samples had a sensitivity of 98% (39/40) while saliva samples had a sensitivity of 79% (26/33). Both saline mouth rinse/gargle and saliva samples showed stable viral RNA detection after 2 days of room temperature storage. Mouth rinse/gargle samples had the highest (mean 4.9) and HCW-collected NP swabs had the lowest acceptability scores (mean 3.1). Conclusion: Saline mouth rinse/gargle samples demonstrated the highest combined user acceptability ratings and analytical performance when compared with saliva and HCW collected NP swabs. This sample type is a promising swab-independent option, particularly for outpatient self-collection in adults and school aged children.","Goldfarb, D. M.; Tilley, P.; Al-Rawahi, G.

13912,Cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans: a systematic review,"IntroductionUnderstanding the cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is critical to vaccine development, epidemiological surveillance and control strategies. This systematic review critically evaluates and synthesises the relevant peer-reviewed and pre-print literature published in recent months.

MethodsFor this systematic review, independent keyword-structured literature searches were carried out in MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19 Primer for studies published from 01/01/2020-26/06/2020. Papers were independently screened by two researchers, with arbitration of disagreements by a third researcher. Data were independently extracted into a pre-designed Excel template and studies critically appraised using a modified version of the MetaQAT tool, with resolution of disagreements by consensus. Findings were narratively synthesised.

Results61 articles were included. Almost all studies used observational designs, were hospital-based, and the majority had important limitations. Symptomatic adult COVID-19 cases consistently show peripheral T cell lymphopenia, which positively correlates with increased disease severity, duration of RNA positivity, and non-survival; while asymptomatic and paediatric cases display preserved counts. People with severe or critical disease generally develop more robust, virus-specific T cell responses. T cell memory and effector function has been demonstrated against multiple viral epitopes, and, cross-reactive T cell responses have been demonstrated in unexposed and uninfected adults, but the significance for protection and susceptibility, respectively, remains unclear.

InterpretationA complex pattern of T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been demonstrated, but inferences regarding population level immunity are hampered by significant methodological limitations and heterogeneity between studies. In contrast to antibody responses, population-level surveillance of the cellular response is unlikely to be feasible in the near term. Focused evaluation in specific sub-groups, including vaccine recipients, should be prioritised.","Shrotri, M.; Van Schalkwyk, M. C.

The demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of the patients were statistically analyzed.

ResultsOf the 137 patients, 88 were male and 49 were female, with a mean age of 49.3 years (SD{+/-}18.4). The patients were elderly (n=29), adults (n=103), and children (n=5). Of these, 54 (39.4%) had comorbidities, 24% were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 12 (8.8%) died. On admission, the main clinical manifestations were fever (82.5%), cough (63.5%), shortness of breath (24.8%), chest pain (19.7%), and fatigue (18.2%).

In all patients, increased neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes were observed. Patients lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated. C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated in 46.7%, D-dimer in 41.6%, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in 39.4% of patients. The elderly showed higher neutrophil (p=0.003) and lower lymphocyte (p=0.001) counts than adults and children. Glucose, creatine kinase-MB, LDH, bilirubin, D-dimer, and ESR were significantly higher in the elderly than in the adults. The COVID-19 death group had a higher leucocyte count (p = 0.043), and higher urea (p=0.025) and potassium (p=0.026) than the recovered group but had a lower hemoglobin concentration (p=0.018). A significant association was determined between COVID-19 death ({chi}2(1)=17.751, p<0.001), and the presence of cardiovascular disease ({chi}2(1)=17.049, p<0.001), hypertension ({chi}2(1)=7.659, p=0.006), renal failure ({chi}2(1)=4.172, p<0.04), old age (t(135) = 4.747, p <0.001), and ICU admission ({chi}2(1) = 17.751 (1), p<0.001).

ConclusionsThe common symptoms found in this study could be useful for identifying potential COVID-19 patients. Investigating some of the laboratory and clinical parameters could help assess the disease progression, risk of mortality, and follow up patients who could progress to a fatal condition.","Ibrahim, M.

18135,Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are associated with protection against reinfection,"BackgroundIt is critical to understand whether infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) protects from subsequent reinfection.

MethodsWe investigated the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive results in seropositive and seronegative healthcare workers (HCWs) attending asymptomatic and symptomatic staff testing at Oxford University Hospitals, UK. Baseline antibody status was determined using anti-spike and/or anti-nucleocapsid IgG assays and staff followed for up to 30 weeks. We used Poisson regression to estimate the relative incidence of PCR-positive results and new symptomatic infection by antibody status, accounting for age, gender and changes in incidence over time.

ResultsA total of 12219 HCWs participated and had anti-spike IgG measured, 11052 were followed up after negative and 1246 after positive antibody results including 79 who seroconverted during follow up. 89 PCR-confirmed symptomatic infections occurred in seronegative individuals (0.46 cases per 10,000 days at risk) and no symptomatic infections in those with anti-spike antibodies. Additionally, 76 (0.40/10,000 days at risk) anti-spike IgG seronegative individuals had PCR-positive tests in asymptomatic screening, compared to 3 (0.21/10,000 days at risk) seropositive individuals. Overall, positive baseline anti-spike antibodies were associated with lower rates of PCR-positivity (with or without symptoms) (adjusted rate ratio 0.24 [95%CI 0.08-0.76, p=0.015]). Rate ratios were similar using anti-nucleocapsid IgG alone or combined with anti-spike IgG to determine baseline status.

ConclusionsPrior SARS-CoV-2 infection that generated antibody responses offered protection from reinfection for most people in the six months following infection. Further work is required to determine the long-term duration and correlates of post-infection immunity.","Lumley, S. F.; O'donnell, D.; Stoesser, N. E.; Matthews, P. C.; Howarth, A.; Hatch, S.

6773,Evidence of Protective Role of Ultraviolet-B (UVB) Radiation in Reducing COVID-19 Deaths,"BackgroundResearch is ongoing to identify an effective way to prevent or treat COVID-19, but thus far these efforts have not yet identified a possible solution. Prior studies indicate the protective role of Ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation in human health, mediated by vitamin D synthesis. In this study, we empirically outline a negative association of UVB radiation as measured by ultraviolet index (UVI) with the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 (COVID- 19 deaths).

MethodsWe carry out an observational study, applying a fixed-effect log-linear regression model to a panel dataset of 152 countries over a period of 108 days (n=6524). We use the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths and case-fatality rate (CFR) as the main dependent variables to test our hypothesis and isolate UVI effect from potential confounding factors such as underlying time trends, country-specific time-constant and time-varying factors such as weather.

FindingsAfter controlling for time-constant and time-varying factors, we find that a permanent unit increase in UVI is associated with a 1.2 percentage points decline in daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths [p < 0.01] as well as a 1.0 percentage points decline in the daily growth rates of CFR [p < 0.05]. These results represent a significant percentage reduction in terms of the daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths (-11.88%) and CFR (-38.46%). Our results are consistent across different model specifications.

InterpretationWe find a significant negative association between UVI and COVID-19 deaths, indicating evidence of the protective role of UVB in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. If confirmed via clinical studies, then the possibility of mitigating COVID-19 deaths via sensible sunlight exposure or vitamin D intervention will be very attractive because it is cost-effective and widely available.","Kalippurayil Moozhipurath, R.; Kraft, L.; Skiera, B.",2020-05-15,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.06.20093419,2,Rahul Kalippurayil Moozhipurath,Goethe University Frankfurt am Main,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.20093419v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.20093419v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1038/s41598-020-74825-z
13143,Extended SEIQR type model for COVID-19 epidemic and data analysis,"An extended SEIQR type model is considered in order to model the COVID-19 epidemic. It contains the classes of susceptible individuals, exposed, infected symptomatic and asymptomatic, quarantined, hospitalized and recovered. The basic reproduction number and the final size of epidemic are determined. The model is used to fit available data for some European countries. A more detailed model with two different subclasses of susceptible individuals is introduced in order to study the influence of social interaction on the disease progression. The coefficient of social interaction K characterizes the level of social contacts in comparison with complete lockdown (K = 0) and the absence of lockdown (K = 1). The fitting of data shows that the actual level of this coefficient in some European countries is about 0.1, characterizing a slow disease progression. A slight increase of this value in the autumn can lead to a strong epidemic burst.","Sharma, S.; Volpert, V.; Banerjee, M.",2020-08-12,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.08.10.20171439,1,Malay Banerjee,IIT Kanpur,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.20171439v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.20171439v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.3934/mbe.2020386
20999,"Ownership and COVID-19 in care homes for older people: A living systematic review of outbreaks, infections, and mortalities","BackgroundThe adult social care sector is being increasingly outsourced to for-profit providers, but the impacts of privatisation on service quality and resident outcomes are unclear. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for-profit providers have been accused of failing their residents by prioritising profits over care, prevention, and caution, which has been reported to result in a higher prevalence of COVID-19 infections and deaths in for-profit care homes. Although many of these reports are anecdotal or based on news reports, there is a growing body of academic research investigating ownership variation across COVID-19 outcomes, which has not been systematically appraised and synthesised.

ObjectivesTo identify, appraise, and synthesise the available research on ownership variation in COVID-19 outcomes (outbreaks, infections, deaths, shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and staff) across for-profit, public, and non-profit care homes for older people, and to update our findings as new research becomes available.

DesignLiving systematic review.

MethodsThis review was prospectively registered with Prospero (CRD42020218673). We searched 17 databases and performed forward and backward citation tracking of all included studies. Search results were screened and reviewed in duplicate. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed in duplicate according to the COSMOS-E guidance. The results were synthesised according to RoB, model adjustment, and country context and visualised using harvest plots.

ResultsTwenty-eight studies across five countries were included, with 75% of included studies conducted in the Unites States. For-profit ownership was not consistently associated with a higher probability of COVID-19 outbreaks across included studies. However, there was compelling evidence of worse COVID-19 outcomes following an outbreak; with for-profit care homes having higher rates of accumulative infections and deaths. For-profit providers were also associated with shortages in PPE, which may have contributed to the higher incidence of infections and deaths.

Chain affiliation was often found to be correlated with higher risk of outbreaks, but not consistently associated with an elevated number of deaths and infections. Private equity ownership was not consistently associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes.

ConclusionFor-profit status was a consistent risk factor for higher cumulative COVID-19 infections and deaths. Thus, ownership among providers may be a key modifiable factor which can be regulated to improve health outcomes in vulnerable populations and reduce health disparities. This review will be updated as new research becomes published, which may change the conclusion of our synthesis.","Bach-Mortensen, A.

19982,Changes in COVID-19-related outcomes and the impacts of the potential risk factors over time: a follow-up analysis,"ImportanceCharacteristics of COVID-19 patients changed over the course of the pandemic. Understanding how risk factors changed over time can enhance the coordination of healthcare resources and protect the vulnerable.

ObjectiveTo investigate the overall trend of severe COVID-19-related outcomes over time since the start of the pandemic, and to evaluate whether the impacts of potential risk factors, such as race/ethnic groups, changed over time.

DesignThis retrospective cohort study included patients tested or treated for COVID-19 at Michigan Medicine (MM) from March 10, 2020, to September 2, 2020. According to the quarter in which they first tested positive, the COVID-19-positive cohort were stratified into three groups: Q1, March 1, 2020 - March 31, 2020; Q2, April 1, 2020 - June 30, 2020; Q3, July 1, 2020 - September 2, 2020.

SettingsLarge, academic medical center.

ParticipantsIndividuals tested or treated for COVID-19.

ExposureExamined potential risk factors included age, race/ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), and residential-level socioeconomic characteristics.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe main outcomes included COVID-19-related hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality, which were identified from the electronic health records from MM.

ResultsThe study cohort consisted of 53,853 patients tested or treated for COVID-19 at MM, with mean (SD) age of 44.8 (23.1), mean (SD) BMI of 29.1 (7.6), and 23,814 (44.2%) males. Among the 2,582 patients who tested positive, 719 (27.8%) were hospitalized, 377 (14.6%) were admitted to ICU, and 129 (5.0%) died. The overall COVID-positive hospitalization rate decreased from 41.5% in Q1 to 12.6% in Q3, and the overall ICU admission rate decreased from 24.5% to 5.3%. Black patients had significantly higher (unadjusted) overall hospitalization rate (265 [41.1%] vs 326 [23.2%]), ICU admission rate (139 [21.6%] vs 172 [12.2%]), and mortality rate (42 [6.5%] vs 56 [4.0%]) than White patients. Each quarter, the hospitalization rate remained higher for Black patients compared to White patients, but this difference was attenuated over time for the (unadjusted) odds ratios (Q1: OR=1.9, 95% CI [1.25, 2.90]; Q2: OR=1.42, 95% CI [1.02, 1.98]; Q3: OR=1.36, 95% CI [0.67, 2.65]). Similar decreasing patterns were observed for ICU admission and mortality. Adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and comorbidity score, the racial disparities in hospitalization between White and Black patients were not significant in each quarter of the year (Q1: OR=1.43, 95% CI [0.75, 2.71]; Q2: OR=1.25, 95% CI [0.79, 1.98]; Q3: OR=1.76 95% CI [0.81, 3.85]), in contrast to what was observed in the full cohort (OR=1.85, 95% CI [1.39, 2.47]). Additionally, significant association of hospitalization with living in densely populated area was identified in the first quarter (OR= 664, 95% CI [20.4, 21600]), but such association disappeared in the second and third quarters (Q2: OR= 1.72 95% CI [0.22, 13.5]; Q3: OR=3.69, 95% CI [0.103, 132]). Underlying liver diseases were positively associated with hospitalization in White patients (OR=1.60, 95% CI [1.01, 2.55], P=.046), but not in Black patients (OR=0.49, 95% CI [0.23, 1.06], P=.072, Pint=.013). Similar results were obtained for the effect of liver diseases on ICU admission in White and Black patients (White: OR=1.75, 95% CI [1.01, 3.05], P=.047; Black: OR=0.46, 95% CI [0.17, 1.26], P=.130, Pint=.030).

Conclusions and RelevanceThese findings suggest that the COVID-19-related hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality rates were decreasing over the course of the pandemic. Although racial disparities persisted, the magnitude of the differences in hospitalization and ICU admission rates diminished over time.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionsC_ST_ABSHow did the overall hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates change over the course of the pandemic and how did they vary by race?

FindingsIn this cohort study of 2,582 patients testing positive for COVID-19, the unadjusted hospitalization rate decreased from 50.5% in Q1 (March 10, 2020, to March 31, 2020) to 17.9% in Q3 (July 1, 2020, to September 2, 2020) for Black patients, and from 23.2% in Q1 to 13.8% in Q3 for White patients. After adjusting for age, sex, sociodemographic factors, and comorbidity conditions, the odds ratios of hospitalization between White and Black patients were not significant in each quarter of the year 2020. No significant associations between ICU admission and race/ethnic groups were identified in each quarter or the entire three quarters.

MeaningThese findings suggests an appreciable decline in hospitalization and ICU admission rates among COVID-19 positive patients. The hospitalization and ICU admission rates across race/ethnic groups became closer over time.","Yu, Y.; Gu, T.; Valley, T. S.; Fritsche, L.

15831,"Quantifying the dynamics of COVID-19 burden and impact of interventions in Java, Indonesia","Measuring COVID-19 spread remains challenging in many countries due to testing limitations. In Java, reported cases and deaths increased throughout 2020 despite intensive control measures, particularly within Jakarta and during Ramadan. However, underlying trends are likely obscured by variations in case ascertainment. COVID-19 protocol funerals in Jakarta provide alternative data indicating a substantially higher burden than observed within confirmed deaths. Transmission estimates using this metric follow mobility trends, suggesting earlier and more sustained intervention impact than observed in routine data. Modelling suggests interventions have lessened spread to rural, older communities with weaker healthcare systems, though predict healthcare capacity will soon be exceeded in much of Java without further control. Our results highlight the important role syndrome-based measures of mortality can play in understanding COVID-19 transmission and burden.","Djaafara, B. A.; Whittaker, C.; Watson, O.

13770,Potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Responses are Associated with Better Prognosis in Hospital Inpatient COVID-19 Disease,"COVID-19 continues to cause a pandemic, having infected more than 20 million people globally. Successful elimination of the SARS-CoV-2 virus will require an effective vaccine. However, the immune correlates of infection are currently poorly understood. While neutralizing antibodies are believed to be essential for protection against infection, the contribution of the neutralizing antibody response to resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been defined. In this study the antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleocapsid proteins were investigated in a UK patient cohort, using optimised immunoassays and a retrovirus-based pseudotype entry assay. It was discovered that in severe COVID-19 infections an early antibody response to both antigens was associated with improved prognosis of infection. While not all SARS-CoV-2-reactive sera were found to possess neutralizing antibodies, neutralizing potency of sera was found to be greater in patients who went on to resolve infection, compared with those that died from COVID-19. Furthermore, viral genetic variation in spike protein was found to influence the production of neutralizing antibodies. Infection with the recently described spike protein variant 614G produced higher levels of neutralizing antibodies when compared to viruses possessing the 614D variant. These findings support the assertion that vaccines targeting generation of neutralizing antibodies may be useful at limiting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assessment of the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 at time of diagnosis will be a useful addition to the diagnostic toolkit, enabling stratification of clinical intervention for severe COVID-19 disease.","Tighe, P.

12543,High effectiveness of multimodal infection control interventions in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections in healthcare professionals: a prospective longitudinal seroconversion study,"ObjectiveTo assess the effectiveness of multimodal infection control interventions in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infections in healthcare professionals

DesignSequential follow-up study

SettingLargest tertiary care centre in northern Germany

Participants1253 employees of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf were sequentially assessed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies at the beginning of the covid-19 epidemic (20 March - 9 April), one month (20 April - 8 May), and another two months later (22 June - 24 July). Of those, 1026 were healthcare workers (HCWs) of whom 292 were directly involved in the care of covid-19 patients. During the study period, infection control interventions were deployed, those included i) strict barrier nursing of all known covid-19 patients including FFP2 (N95) masks, goggles, gloves, hoods and protective gowns, ii) visitor restrictions with access control at all hospital entries, iii) mandatory wearing of disposable face masks in all clinical settings, and iv) universal RT-PCR admission screening of patients.

Main Outcome MeasuresSARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion rate

ResultsAt the initial screening, ten participants displayed significant IgG antibody ratios. Another ten individuals showed seroconversion at the second time point one month later, only two further participants seroconverted during the subsequent two months. The overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the study cohort at the last follow-up was 1.8%, the seroconversion rate dropped from 0.81% to 0.08% per month despite a longer observation period. Amongst HCWs seropositivity was increased in those directly involved in the care of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections (3.8%, n=11) compared to other HCWs (1.4%, n=10, P=0.025). However, after the adoption of all multimodal infection control interventions seroconversions were observed in only two more HCWs, neither of whom were involved in inpatient care.

11905,Disparity in the quality of COVID-19 data reporting across India,"BackgroundTransparent and accessible reporting of COVID-19 data is critical for public health efforts. Each state and union territory (UT) of India has its own mechanism for reporting COVID-19 data, and the quality of their reporting has not been systematically evaluated. We present a comprehensive assessment of the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the Indian state and union territory governments. This assessment informs the public health efforts in India and serves as a guideline for pandemic data reporting by other governments.

MethodsWe designed a semi-quantitative framework to assess the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the states and union territories of India. This framework is based on 45 indicators that capture four key aspects of public health data reporting - availability, accessibility, granularity, and privacy. We then used this framework to calculate a COVID-19 Data Reporting Score (CDRS, ranging from 0 to 1) for 29 statesi based on the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the state during the two-week period from 19 May to 1 June, 2020. States that reported less than 10 total confirmed cases as of May 18, were excluded from the study.

FindingsOur results indicate a strong disparity in the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the state governments in India. CDRS varies from 0.61 (good) in Karnataka to 0.0 (poor) in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, with a median value of 0.26. Only ten states provide a visual representation of the trend in COVID-19 data. Ten states do not report any data stratified by age, gender, comorbidities or districts. In addition, we identify that Punjab and Chandigarh compromised the privacy of individuals under quarantine by releasing their personally identifiable information on the official websites. Across the states, the CDRS is positively associated with the states sustainable development index for good health and well-being (Pearson correlation: r = 0.630, p = 0.0003).

InterpretationThe disparity in CDRS across states highlights three important findings at the national, state, and individual level. At the national level, it shows the lack of a unified framework for reporting COVID-19 data in India, and highlights the need for a central agency to monitor or audit the quality of data reporting done by the states. Without a unified framework, it is difficult to aggregate the data from different states, gain insights from them, and coordinate an effective nationwide response to the pandemic. Moreover, it reflects the inadequacy in coordination or sharing of resources among the states in India. Coordination among states is particularly important as more people start moving across states in the coming months. The disparate reporting score also reflects inequality in individual access to public health information and privacy protection based on the state of residence.

9153,"Social distancing across vulnerability, race, politics, and employment: How different Americans changed behaviors before and after major COVID-19 policy announcements","BackgroundAs states reopen in May 2020, the United States is still trying to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. To appropriately design policies and anticipate behavioral change, it is important to understand how different Americans social distancing behavior shifts in relation to policy announcements according to individual characteristics, and community vulnerability.

MethodsThis cross-sectional study used Unacasts social distancing data from February 24th - May 10th, 2020 to study how social distancing changed before and after: 1) The World Health Organizations declaration of a global pandemic, 2) White House announcement of ""Opening Up America Again"" (OUAA) guidelines, and 3) the week of April 27 when several states reopened. To measure intention to social distance, we assessed the difference between weekday and weekend behavior as more individuals have more control over weekend leisure time. To investigate social distancings sensitivity to different population characteristics, we compared social distancing time-series data across county vulnerability as measured by the COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) which defines vulnerability across socioeconomic, household composition, minority status, epidemiological, and healthcare-system related factors. We also compared social distancing across population groupings by race, 2016 presidential election voting choice, and employment sectors.

ResultsMovement reduced significantly throughout March reaching peak reduction on April 12th (-56.1%) prior the enactment of any reopening policies. Shifts in social distancing began after major announcements but prior to specific applied policies: Following the WHO declaration, national social distancing significantly increased on weekdays and weekends (-18.6% and -41.3% decline in mobility, respectively). Social distancing significantly declined on weekdays and weekends after OUAA guidelines (i.e. before state reopening) (+1.1% and +5.3% increase in mobility, respectively) with additional significant decline after state reopening (+10.0% and +20.9% increase in mobility, respectively). Social distancing was significantly greater on weekends than weekdays throughout March, however, the trend reversed by early May with significantly less social distancing on weekends, suggesting a shift in intent to social distance during leisure time. In general, vulnerable counties social distanced less than non-vulnerable counties, and had a greater difference between weekday and weekend behavior until state reopening. This may be driven by structural barriers that vulnerable communities face, such as higher rates of employment in particular sectors. At all time periods studied, the average black individual in the US social distanced significantly more than the average white individual, and the average 2016 Clinton voter social distanced significantly more than the average 2016 Trump voter. Social distancing behavior differed across industries with three clusters of employment sectors.

ConclusionBoth signaling of a policy change and implementation of a policy are important factors that seem to influence social distancing. Behaviors shifted with national announcements prior to mandates, though social distancing further declined nationwide as the first states reopened. The variation in behavioral drivers including vulnerability, race, political affiliation, and employment industry demonstrates the need for targeted policy messaging and interventions tailored to address specific barriers for improved social distancing and mitigation.","Huang, V.

5297,Bringing accountability to the peak of the pandemic using linear response theory,"The peak of the daily new infections in COVID-19 remained qualitative in description and elusive in arrival. Because of the lack of clarity in what to expect from the peak, apart from the hope that one day the peak will be reached, there has been no metric to describe the success of the implemented strategies. We propose a way of predicting the number of infections that can be expected after a lockdown, assuming they come from the asymptomatic cases prior to the lockdown and using linear response theory. These predictions for several western countries faithfully follow the observed infections for several weeks after the lockdown, suggesting universalities in the recovery pattern of several countries. At the same time, the gap between the quantitative predictions of the recovery patterns for New York and Milan and the observations is striking. These gaps which arise even while emulating the recovery patterns of other western countries raise the possibility of an audit of the success of the implemented strategies, and the potential newer sources of infection.","Prakash, M.

4490,RISK ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION FOR COVID19 DEMOGRAPHICS IN LOW RESOURCE SETTINGS USING A PYTHON DESKTOP APP AND EXCEL MODELS.,"While the novel covid19 disease caused by sar-cov-2 corona virus has proved a serious threat to mankind it being a pandemic, the rate at which technology in low resource income countries like Uganda has been used to predict the spread and impact of the disease in their economies has not been strongly employed. This paper presents a an excel model and desktop application software developed using open source python programming tools for carrying out risk analysis and prediction of demographics for covid19 disease. Prediction results for both models clearly stated using epidemiological curve, these results can vary based on the force of infection which varies based on government measures and actions. With a certain degree of certainty of the potential impact of the disease on low resource countries, it will foster proper planning and strategical methods to properly manage the pandemic.","Kyagulanyi, A.; Muhanguzi, J.

17283,Honey and Nigella sativa against COVID-19 in Pakistan (HNS-COVID-PK): A multi-center placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial,"BACKGROUNDNo definitive treatment exists for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Honey and Nigella sativa (HNS) have established antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Hence, we investigated efficacy of HNS against COVID-19. wide

METHODSWe conducted a multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial at 4 centers in Pakistan. RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 adults showing moderate or severe disease were enrolled in the study. Patients presenting with multi-organ failure, ventilator support, and chronic diseases (except diabetes mellitus and hypertension) were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to receive either honey (1 gm/Kg/day) and Nigella sativa seeds (80 mg/Kg/day) or placebo up-to 13 days along with standard care. The outcomes included symptom alleviation, viral clearance, and a 30-day mortality in intention-to-treat population. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04347382.

RESULTSThree hundred and thirteen patients - 210 moderate and 103 severe - underwent randomization from April 30 to July 29, 2020. Among these, 107 were assigned to HNS whereas 103 to placebo for moderate cases. For severe cases, 50 were given HNS and 53 were given placebos. HNS resulted in [~]50% reduction in time taken to alleviate symptoms as compared to placebo (Moderate (4 versus 7 days), Hazard Ratio [HR]: 6.11; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 4.23-8.84, P<0.0001 and severe (6 versus 13 days) HR: 4.04; 95% CI, 2.46-6.64, P<0.0001). HNS also cleared the virus 4 days earlier than placebo group in moderate (6 versus 10 days, HR: 5.53; 95% CI: 3.76-8.14, P<0.0001) and severe cases (8.5 versus 12 days, HR: 4.32; 95% CI: 2.62-7.13, P<0.0001). HNS further led to a better clinical score on day 6 with normal activity resumption in 63.6% versus 10.9% among moderate cases (OR: 0.07; 95% CI: 0.03-0.13, P<0.0001) and hospital discharge in 50% versus 2.8% in severe cases (OR: 0.03; 95% CI: 0.01-0.09, P<0.0001). In severe cases, mortality rate was four-fold lower in HNS group than placebo (4% versus 18.87%, OR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.02-0.92, P=0.029). No HNS-related adverse effects were observed.

CONCLUSIONHNS significantly improved symptoms, viral clearance and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Thus, HNS represents an affordable over the counter therapy and can either be used alone or in combination with other treatments to achieve potentiating effects against COVID-19.

15278,Reorganization of Substance Use Treatment and Harm Reduction Services during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Global Survey,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted people with substance use disorders (SUDs) worldwide, and healthcare systems have reorganized their services in response to the pandemic. Methods: One week after the announcement of the COVID-19 as a pandemic, in a global survey, 177 addiction medicine professionals described COVID-19-related health responses in their own 77 countries in terms of SUD treatment and harm reduction services. The health response is categorized around (1) managerial measures and systems, (2) logistics, (3) service providers, and (4) vulnerable groups. Results: Respondents from over 88% of countries reported that core medical and psychiatric care for SUDs had continued; however, only 56% of countries reported having had any business continuity plan, and 37.5% of countries reported shortages of methadone or buprenorphine supplies. Participants of 41% of countries reported partial discontinuation of harm-reduction services such as needle and syringe programs and condom distribution. 57% of overdose prevention interventions and 81% of outreach services also having been negatively impacted. Conclusions: Participants reported that SUD treatment and harm reduction services had been significantly impacted globally early during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on our findings, we provide a series of recommendations to support countries to be prepared more efficiently for future waves or similar pandemics to 1) help policymakers generate business continuity plans, 2) maintain the use of evidence-based interventions for people with SUDs, 3) be prepared for adequate medication supplies, 4) integrate harm reduction programs with other treatment modalities and 5) have specific considerations for vulnerable groups such as immigrants and refugees.","Radfar, S.

14845,On Machine Learning-Based Short-Term Adjustment of Epidemiological Projections of COVID-19 in US,"Epidemiological models have provided valuable information for the outlook of COVID-19 pandemic and relative impact of different mitigation scenarios. However, more accurate forecasts are often needed at near term for planning and staffing. We present our early results from a systemic analysis of short-term adjustment of epidemiological modeling of COVID 19 pandemic in US during March-April 2020. Our analysis includes the importance of various types of features for short term adjustment of the predictions. In addition, we explore the potential of data augmentation to address the data limitation for an emerging pandemic. Following published literature, we employ data augmentation via clustering of regions and evaluate a number of clustering strategies to identify early patterns from the data. From our early analysis, we used CovidActNow as our underlying epidemiological model and found that the most impactful features for the one-day prediction horizon are population density, workers in commuting flow, number of deaths in the day prior to prediction date, and the autoregressive features of new COVID-19 cases from three previous dates of the prediction. Interestingly, we also found that counties clustered with New York County resulted in best preforming model with maximum of R2= 0.90 and minimum of R2= 0.85 for state-based and COVID-based clustering strategy, respectively.","Kefayati, S.; Huang, H.; Chakraborty, P.; Roberts, F.; Gopalakrishnan, V.; Srinivasan, R.; Pethe, S.; Madan, P.; Deshpande, A.; Liu, X.; Hu, J.; Jackson, G.",2020-09-13,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.11.20180521,1,Sarah Kefayati,IBM Watson Health,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20180521v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20180521v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
17590,"Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases predict different COVID-19 outcomes, a UK Biobank study","In December 2019, a coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began infecting humans causing a novel disease, coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). This was first described in the Wuhan province of the Peoples Republic of China. SARS-CoV-2 spread throughout the world causing a global pandemic. To date, thousands of cases of COVID-19 were reported in the United Kingdom, and over 45,000 patients have died. Some progress has been achieved in managing this disease, but the biological determinants of health, besides age, that affect COVID-19 infectivity and mortality are under scrutiny. Recent studies show that several medical conditions, including diabetes and hypertension, increase the risk of COVID-19 infection and death. The increased vulnerability of the elderly and those with comorbidities, together with the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases with advanced age, led us to investigate the links between neurodegeneration and COVID-19. We analysed the primary health records of 13,338 UK individuals tested for COVID-19 between March and July 2020. We show that a pre-existing diagnosis of Alzheimers disease predicts the highest risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality among the elderly. In contrast, Parkinsons disease patients were found to be at increased risk of infection but not mortality from COVID-19. We conclude that there are disease-specific differences in COVID-19 susceptibility among patients affected by neurodegenerative disorders.","Yu, Y.; Travaglio, M.; Popovic, R.; Leal, N.

OBJECTIVESTo characterize the population that performed the SARS-CoV-2 molecular and serological tests in Carlos Chagas-Sabin laboratories in Cuiaba.

METHODSA retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out with all the samples collected from nasal swab tested by RT-PCR and serological for SARM-CoV-2 IgM / IgG from the population served between April and July 2020.

FINDINGSIn the analyzed period, 11,113 PCR-Covid-19 exams were registered. Of this total of cases, 3,912 (35.20%) tested positive, while 6,889 (61.90%) did not detect viral RNA and 312 (2.80%) of the visits resulted as undetermined. The peak of positive RT-PCR performed in July (n = 5878), with 35.65% (n = 2096). A total of 6,392 tests performed on SOROVID-19, with a peak of 1161 (18.16%) of the positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 in July.

MAIN CONCLUSIONSMolecular positivity and serological tests, both peaked in July 2020, were mostly present in women aged 20-39, characterizing Cuiaba as the epicenter of the Midwest region in this period due to the high rate of transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2.","De Paula, C.

19660,From SARS-CoV-2 infection to COVID-19 disease: a proposed mechanism for viral spread to the lower airway based on in silico estimation of virion flow rates,"While the nasopharynx in the upper respiratory airway is the dominant initial infection site for SARS-CoV-2, the physiologic mechanism that launches the infection in the lower airway is still not well-understood. Based on the rapidity with which SARS-CoV-2 infection progresses to the lungs, it has been conjectured that the nasopharynx acts as the seeding zone for subsequent contamination of the lower airway via aspiration of virus-laden boluses of nasopharyngeal fluids. In this study, we examine the plausibility of this proposed mechanism. To this end, we have developed computational fluid mechanics models of the inhalation process in two medical imaging based airway reconstructions and have quantified the nasopharyngeal liquid volume ingested into the lower airspace during each aspiration. The numerical predictions are validated by comparing the number of projected aspirations (approximately 2 - 4) during an eight-hour sleep cycle with prior observational findings of 3 aspirations in human subjects. Extending the numerical trends on aspiration volume to earlier records on aspiration frequency for the entire day indicates a total aspirated nasopharyngeal liquid volume of 0.3 - 0.76 ml per day. We then used sputum assessment data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients to estimate the number of virions that are transmitted daily to the lungs via nasopharyngeal liquid boluses. For mean sputum viral load, our modeling projects that the number of virions penetrating to the lower airway per day will range over 2.1 x 106 - 5.3 x 106; for peak viral load, the corresponding number of penetrating virions hovers between 7.1 x 108 - 17.9 x 108. These findings fill in a key piece of the mechanistic puzzle of the progression from SARS-CoV-2 infection of the nasopharynx to the development of COVID-19 disease within a patient, and point to dysphagia as a potential underlying risk factor for COVID-19. The findings also have significant practical implications in the design of COVID-19 prophylactics and therapeutics that aim to constrain the pathogenic progress of the disease within the limits of the upper airway.","Basu, S.; Chakravarty, A.",2020-12-22,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.12.19.20248544,1,Saikat Basu,South Dakota State University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.19.20248544v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.19.20248544v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

We observe an extensive spread of virus in this Brazilian site. The data on sex, age and symptoms presented by the investigated individuals were similar to what has been observed worldwide. The genomic analysis of the viruses revealed important amino acid changes, including the D614G and the I33T in Spike and ORF6 proteins, respectively. The latter found in strains originating in Brazil. The phylogenetic analyzes demonstrated the circulation of the lineages B.1 and B.1.1, whose circulation in Brazil has already been previous reported.

21029,The effectiveness of the first dose of BNT162 b 2 vaccine in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection 13-24 days after immunization: real-world evidence,"BackgroundBNT162b2 vaccines showed high efficacy against COVID-19 in a randomised controlled phase-III trial. A vaccine effectiveness evaluation in real life settings is urgently needed, especially given the global disease surge. Hence, we assessed the short-term effectiveness of the first dose of BNT162b2-vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the BNT162b2 Phase-III results, we hypothesized that the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinees will decline after 12 days following immunization compared to the incidence during the preceding days.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from 2{middle dot}6 million-member state-mandated health provider in Israel. Study population consisted of all members aged 16 or above years who were vaccinated with BNT162b2-vaccine between December/19/2020 and January/15/2021. We collected information regarding medical history and positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test from days after first dose to January/17/2021. Daily and cumulative infection rates in days 13-24 were compared to days 1-12 after first dose using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and generalized linear models.

FindingsData of 503,875 individuals (mean age 59{middle dot}7 years SD=14{middle dot}7, 47{middle dot}8% males) were analysed, of whom 351,897 had 13-24 days of follow-up. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0{middle dot}57% (n=2484) during days 1-12 and 0{middle dot}27% (n=614) in days 13-24. A 51{middle dot}4% relative risk reduction (RRR) was calculated in weighted-average daily incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection from 43{middle dot}41-per-100,000(SE=12{middle dot}07) in days 1-12 to 21{middle dot}08-per-100,000(SE=6{middle dot}16) in days 13-24 following immunization. The decrement in incidence was evident from day 18 after first dose. Similar RRRs were calculated in individuals aged 60 or above (44.5%), younger individuals (50.2%), females (50.0%) and males (52.1%). Findings were similar in sub-populations and patients with various comorbidities.

ConclusionsWe demonstrated an effectiveness of 51% of BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection 13-24 days after immunization with the first dose. Immunization with the second dose should be continued to attain the anticipated protection.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for follow-up studies regarding the effectiveness of BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine without any language restrictions. The search terms were (BNT162b2 OR mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine) AND (effectiveness OR real-world OR phase IV) until Jan 15, 2021. We found no relevant observational studies among humans. We also assessed Phase II and Phase III clinical trials with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the first and largest phase IV study on the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in real-world settings. Our findings showed that the first dose of the vaccine is associated with an approximately 51% reduction in the incidence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections at 13 to 24 days after immunization compared to the rate during the first 12 days. Similar levels of effectiveness were found across age groups, sex, as well as among individuals residing in Arab or ultra-orthodox Jewish communities that display an increased COVID-19 risk.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe study results indicate that in real life the first dose of the new BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine confers around 50% protection against overall SARS-CoV-2 infections (symptomatic or asymptomatic). Together our findings and the 95% efficacy shown in the phase III trial, suggest that the BNT162b2 vaccine should be administered in two doses to achieve maximum protection and impact in terms of disease burden reduction and possibly reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. COVID-19 vaccines should be urgently deployed globally.","Chodcik, G.; Tene, L.; Patalon, T.; Gazit, S.; Ben-Tov, A.; Cohen, D.; Muhsen, K.",2021-01-29,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.01.27.21250612,1,Gabriel Chodcik,Maccabitech,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.27.21250612v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.27.21250612v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
11583,Utrametric diffusion model for spread of covid-19 in socially clustered population: Can herd immunity be approached in Sweden?,"We present a new mathematical model of disease spread reflecting specialties of covid-19 epidemic by elevating the role social clustering of population. The model can be used to explain slower approaching herd immunity in Sweden, than it was predicted by a variety of other mathematical models; see graphs Fig. 2. The hierarchic structure of social clusters is mathematically modeled with ultrametric spaces having treelike geometry. To simplify mathematics, we consider homogeneous trees with p-branches leaving each vertex. Such trees are endowed with algebraic structure, the p-adic number fields. We apply theory of the p-adic diffusion equation to describe coronavirus spread in hierarchically clustered population. This equation has applications to statistical physics and microbiology for modeling dynamics on energy landscapes. To move from one social cluster (valley) to another, the virus (its carrier) should cross a social barrier between them. The magnitude of a barrier depends on the number of social hierarchys levels composing this barrier. As the most appropriate for the recent situation in Sweden, we consider linearly increasing barriers. This structure matches with mild regulations in Sweden. The virus spreads rather easily inside a social cluster (say working collective), but jumps to other clusters are constrained by social barriers. This behavior matches with the covid-19 epidemic, with its cluster spreading structure. Our model differs crucially from the standard mathematical models of spread of disease, such as the SIR-model. We present socio-medical specialties of the covid-19 epidemic supporting our purely diffusional model.

20430,Elevated Angiopoietin-2 inhibits thrombomodulin-mediated anticoagulation in critically ill COVID-19 patients,"Several studies suggest that hypercoagulation and endothelial dysfunction play central roles in severe forms of COVID-19. Here, we hypothesized that the high levels of the inflammatory cytokine Angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) reported in hospitalized COVID-19 patients might promote hypercoagulation through ANGPT2 binding to thrombomodulin with resulting inhibition of thrombin/thrombomodulin-mediated physiological anticoagulation. We therefore investigated plasma samples taken at two timepoints from 20 critically ill COVID-19 patients in intensive care regarding ANGPT2 levels and coagulation markers in comparison with 20 healthy blood donors. We found that ANGPT2 levels were increased in the COVID-19 patients in correlation with disease severity, hypercoagulation, and mortality. To test causality, we administered ANGPT2 to wildtype mice and found that it shortened bleeding time in a tail injury model. In further support of a role for ANGPT2 in physiological coagulation, bleeding time was increased in endothelial-specific Angpt2 knockout mice. Using in vitro assays, we found that ANGPT2 inhibited thrombomodulin-mediated anticoagulation and protein C activation in human donor plasma. Our data reveal a novel mechanism for ANGPT2 in hypercoagulation and suggest that Angiopoietin-2 inhibition may be tested in the treatment of hypercoagulation in severe COVID-19, as well as in certain other conditions, including sepsis.","Hultstrom, M.; Fromell, K.; Larsson, A.; Quaggin, S.

3525,Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus in semen and testicular biopsy specimen of COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundAs of March 11, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared as a pandemic. Expending our understanding of the transmission routes of the viral infection is crucial in controlling the outbreak. It is unclear whether the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) can directly infect the testes or male genital tract and be sexually transmitted from males.

MethodsFrom January 31 to March 14, 2020, 12 patients in recovery and one patient died of COVID-19 were included in this descriptive study. The clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, chest CT scans and outcome data were recorded. To examine whether there is sexual transmission from male, we employed realtime polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect 2019-nCov in semen or testicular biopsy specimen.

FindingsThe age range of the 12 patients in recovery was 22-38 years. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia. As of March 14, 2020, ten patients discharged from the hospital while the rest 2 had developed into recovery stage. All of the 12 patients in recovery tested negative for 2019-nCoV RNA in semen samples. Another patient aged 67 died in March 10, 2020, whose tissue sample via testicular biopsy was also tested negative for viral RNA.

ConclusionNo positive RT-PCR result was found in the semen or testicular biopsy specimen. The results from this study show no evidence of sexual transmission of 2019-nCov from males.","Song, C.; Wang, Y.; Li, W.; Hu, B.; Chen, G.; Xia, P.; Wang, W.; Li, C.; Hu, Z.; Yang, X.; Yao, B.; Liu, Y.",2020-04-10,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.31.20042333,2,Xiaoyu Yang,JiangSu Province Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20042333v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20042333v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
3060,Modelling SARS-CoV-2 Dynamics: Implications for Therapy,"The scientific community is focussed on developing antiviral therapies to mitigate the impacts of the ongoing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. This will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected hosts. Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load data collected from the same specimen (throat / nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal / sputum / tracheal aspirate), we compare within-host dynamics for patients infected in the current outbreak with analogous dynamics for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections. Our quantitative analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics are more severe than those for mild cases of MERS-CoV, but are similar to severe cases, and that the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV infection are similar to those of MERS-CoV in mild cases but not in severe case. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 generates infection dynamics that are more severe than SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we used our viral dynamics model to predict the effectiveness of unlicensed drugs that have different methods of action. The effectiveness was measured by AUC of viral load. Our results indicated that therapies that block de novo infections or virus production are most likely to be effective if initiated before the peak viral load (which occurs around three days after symptom onset on average), but therapies that promote cytotoxicity are likely to have only limited effects. Our unique mathematical approach provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, which are useful for development of antiviral therapies.

Significance StatementAntiviral agents with different mechanisms of action have different curative effects depending on precisely when therapy is initiated. Based on a model of viral dynamics, parameterised using viral load data from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients reported by Zou et al. (1), computer simulations were performed. We propose that effective treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection requires an appropriate choice of class-specific drugs and initiation timing as reported for treatment of other viral infections (2); otherwise, antivirals do not have a significant effect on the within-host viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and are wasted.","Kim, K.

12684,A throughput serological Western blot system using whole virus lysate for the concomitant detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and human endemic Coronaviridae,"BO_SCPLOWACKGROUNDC_SCPLOWSeroreactivity against human endemic coronaviruses has been linked to disease severity after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assays that are capable of concomitantly detecting antibodies against endemic coronaviridae such as OC43, 229E, NL63, and SARS-CoV-2 may help to elucidate this question. We set up a platform for serum-screening and developed a bead-based Western blot system, namely DigiWest, capable of running hundreds of assays using microgram amounts of protein prepared directly from different viruses.

MO_SCPLOWETHODSC_SCPLOWThe parallelized and miniaturised DigiWest assay was adapted for detecting antibodies using whole protein extract prepared from isolated SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. After characterisation and optimization of the newly established test, whole virus lysates of OC43, 229E, and NL63 were integrated into the system.

RO_SCPLOWESULTSC_SCPLOWThe DigiWest-based immunoassay system for detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies shows a sensitivity of 87.2 % and diagnostic specificity of 100 %. Concordance analysis with the SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays available by Roche, Siemens, and Euroimmun indicates a comparable assay performance (Cohens Kappa ranging from 0.8799-0.9429). In the multiplexed assay, antibodies against the endemic coronaviruses OC43, 229E, and NL63 were detected, displaying a high incidence of seroreactivity against these coronaviruses.

CO_SCPLOWONCLUSIONC_SCPLOWThe DigiWest-based immunoassay, which uses authentic antigens from isolated virus particles, is capable of detecting individual serum responses against SARS-CoV-2 with high specificity and sensitivity in one multiplexed assay. It shows high concordance with other commercially available serologic assays.

17260,COVID-19 Active Surveillance Simulation Case Study - Health and Economic Impacts of Active Surveillance in a School Environment,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lives of almost all human beings and has forced stay-at-home mandates across the world. Government and school officials are facing challenging decisions on how to start the new 2020/2021 school year. Almost every school system has chosen a remote learning model for the Fall of 2020 while many are facing financial and logistical challenges.

In this study, we explore the efficacy of an Active Surveillance testing model where a random number of students are tested daily for early detection of asymptomatic patients and for prevention of the infection among the student population. In addition to health impacts, we also analyze the financial impact of deploying the Active Surveillance system in schools while taking into consideration lost workdays of parents, hospitalization costs, and testing costs.

Under the given assumptions, initial modeling results indicate that low Active Surveillance testing rates (between 6-10% daily testing of student population) can help achieve low infection rates ([&le;]10%) among students along with enforcing mitigation procedures, such as wearing masks and social distancing. Without enforcing mitigation procedures, the optimal Active Surveillance rate of 8-10% can also achieve ([&le;]10%) infection rates among student population. The results also demonstrate that Active Surveillance can lower the financial burden of the pandemic by proactively lowering the infection rates among student populations.","Saad, A.

16575,Intravenous Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Extracorporeal Oxygenation Patients with Severe COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,"BackgroundThere is an ongoing critical need to improve therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly in the most severely affected patients. Adult mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) infusions have the potential to benefit critically ill patients with acute respiratory syndrome SARS-COV-2 infection, but clinical data supporting efficacy are lacking.

MethodsWe conducted a case-control study of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To evaluate clinical responsiveness in the most critically ill patient we examined outcomes in a sub-group of those requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Patients (n=9) were administered with up to 3 infusions of intravenous (IV) MSCs and compared to a local ECMO control group (n=31). The primary outcome was safety, and the secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality (or rate of hospital discharge), cytokine levels, and viral clearance.

FindingsMSC infusions (12 patients) were well tolerated and no side effects occurred. Of ECMO patients receiving MSC infusions, 2 out of 9 died (22.2%; 95%CI: 2.8%, 60.0%) compared with a mortality of 15 of 31 (48.4%; 95%CI: 30.2%, 66.9%; p = 0.25) in the ECMO control group. Isolated plasma exosomes containing the SARS-COV-2 Spike protein decreased after MSC infusions between day 14 or 21 after administration (p=0.003 and p=0.005, respectively) and was associated with a decrease in COVID-19 IgG Spike protein titer at same time points (p = 0.006 and p=0.007, respectively). Control ECMO patients receiving convalescent plasma did not clear COVID-19 IgG over the same time frame.

InterpretationTogether these findings suggest that MSC IV infusion is well tolerated in patients with a broad range of severity including the most severe COVID-19 ARDS requiring ECMO. These data also raise the possibility that MSCs, in addition to exerting an immunomodulatory effect, contribute to viral clearance and strongly support the conduct of randomized placebo-controlled trial.","Kaushal, S.; Khan, A.; Deatrick, K.; Ng, D.

As the growth of infection slows, decisions regarding easing of lockdown restrictions are required, keeping in view the capacity of the health-care system. In this paper, we quantify the impact of a multi-phased release of the population from lockdown. Using the SIR model for epidemic spread, we design and implement a method to determine the earliest time of release from lockdown restrictions, constrained by a specified threshold on the subsequent peaks of infection. Trade-offs between the threshold and the earliest times of removing lockdown restrictions are illustrated. Additionally, we consider alternative policy decisions where the population is released gradually from lockdown restrictions and illustrate the trade-offs between the rate of release of population and number of active infections.","Zhang, Y.; Hota, M.; Kapoor, S.",2020-05-15,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.10.20096446,1,Sanjiv Kapoor,"Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, USA",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.10.20096446v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.10.20096446v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

17402,"Low dose hydroxychloroquine is associated with lower mortality in COVID-19: a meta-analysis of 26 studies and 44,521 patients","BackgroundHydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was proposed as potential treatment for COVID-19, but its association with mortality is not well characterized. We conducted two meta-analyses to evaluate the association between HCQ (with or without azithromycin (AZM)) and total mortality in COVID-19 patients.

MethodsArticles were retrieved until October 20th, 2020 by searching in seven databases. Data were combined using the general variance-based method on relative risk estimates.

ResultsA total of 26 articles were found (N=44,521 COVID-19 patients, including N=7,324 from 4 randomized clinical trials (RCTs)); 10 studies were valuable for analysing the association of HCQ+AZM. Overall, the use of HCQ was associated with 21% lower mortality risk (pooled risk ratio: 0.79, 95%CI: 0.67 to 0.93; high level of heterogeneity: I2=82%, random effects). This association vanished (1.10, 95%CI: 0.99 to 1.23 and 1.10, 95%CI: 0.99 to 1.23) when daily dose >400 mg or total dose >4,400 mg were used, respectively). HCQ+AZM was also associated with 25% lower mortality risk, but uncertainty was large (95%CI: 0.50 to 1.13; P=0.17). No association was apparent when only pooling the 4 RCTs (13.8% of the overall weight; pooled risk ratio: 1.11, 95%CI: 0.99 to 1.24).

ConclusionsHCQ use was not associated with either increased or decreased mortality in COVID-19 patients when 4 RCTs only were evaluated, while a 7% to 33% reduced mortality was observed when observational studies were also included. The association was mainly apparent when pooling studies using lower doses of HCQ. These findings can help disentangling the debate on HCQ use in COVID-19.

Key-pointsLow dose hydroxychloroquine was associated with reduced mortality in COVID-19 patients, as seen in observational studies but not in randomised clinical trials, which used high doses of hydroxychloroquine. These findings can help disentangling the debate on hydroxychloroquine use in COVID-19.","Di Castelnuovo, A.; Costanzo, S.; Cassone, A.; Cauda, R.; De Gaetano, G.; Iacoviello, L.",2020-11-04,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.11.01.20223958,1,Licia Iacoviello,"Department of Epidemiology and Prevention, IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Italy and Research Centre in Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine (EPIMED), Department of M",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.01.20223958v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.01.20223958v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

Materials and MethodsA retrospective, secondary database review study was conducted. The information was collected from an epidemiological surveillance activity in close contacts (co-inhabitants) in 52 households in Metropolitan Lima with only one member with COVID-19. A reevaluation was carried out in 10 households. Epidemiological and clinical variables were evaluated and its association with the result of the rapid serological test (presence of IgG, IgM or both).

ResultsSecondary cases were found in 40 households, which represents an average of 49.9% identification per household. A secondary attack rate of 53.0% (125 cases) was found among cohabitants, with 77.6% of cases being symptomatic (symptomatic / asymptomatic ratio: 3.5). The presence of fever and / or chills was found in 40.0% of people with a positive result, followed by a sore throat, in 39.2%.

Data extractionTwo authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality and risk of bias. We calculated the secondary attack rate as the number of contacts with SARS-CoV-2, divided by the number of contacts tested.

Data synthesisOf 928 studies identified, 19 were included. Secondary attack rates from asymptomatic index cases ranged from 0% to 2.8% (9 studies). Pre-symptomatic secondary attack rates ranged from 0.7% to 31.8% (10 studies). The highest secondary attack rates were found in contacts who lived in the same household as the index case. Other activities associated with transmission were group activities such as sharing meals or playing board games with the index case.

LimitationsWe excluded some studies because the index case or number of contacts were unclear. Owing to the anticipated heterogeneity, we did not produce a summary estimate of the included studies.

ConclusionAsymptomatic patients can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others, but our findings indicate that such individuals are responsible for fewer secondary infections than people with symptoms in the same studies.

4017,"Is the spread of COVID-19 across countries influenced by environmental, economic and social factors?","The SARS-CoV-2 virus, emerged from Wuhan, China is spreading all over the world in an unprecedented manner, causing millions of infections and thousands of deaths. However, the spread of the disease across countries and regions are not even. Why some countries and regions are more affected than some other countries and regions? We employ simple statistical methods to investigate any linkage between the severity of the disease and the environmental, economic and social factors of countries. The estimation results indicate that the number of confirmed cases of Coronavirus infection is higher in countries with lower yearly average temperatures, higher economic openness and stronger political democracy. However, findings of this analysis should be interpreted carefully keeping in mind the fact that statistical relations do not necessarily imply causation. Only clinical experiments with medical expertise can confirm how the virus behaves in the environment.","Hossain, M.

7893,"Age, gender and COVID-19 infections","Data for ten European countries which provide detailed distribution of COVID-19 cases by sex and age show that among people of working age, women diagnosed with COVID-19 substantially outnumber infected men. This pattern reverses around retirement: infection rates among women fall at age 60-69, resulting in a cross-over with infection rates among men. The relative disadvantage of women peaks at ages 20-29, whereas the male disadvantage in infection rates peaks at ages 70-79. The elevated infection rates among women of working age are likely tied to their higher share in health- and care-related occupations. Our examination also suggests a link between womens employment profiles and infection rates in prime working ages. The same factors that determine womens higher life expectancy account for their lower fatality and higher male disadvantage at older ages.","Sobotka, T.; Brzozowska, Z.; Muttarak, R.; Zeman, K.; Di Lego, V.",2020-05-26,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.05.24.20111765,1,Tomáš Sobotka,"Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital (Univ.

17708,Automatic COVID-19 Detection from chest radiographic images using Convolutional Neural Network,"The global pandemic of the novel coronavirus that started in Wuhan, China has affected more than 50 million people worldwide and caused more than 1263,787 tragic deaths. To date, the COVID-19 virus is still spreading and affecting thousands of people. The main problem with testing for COVID-19 is that there are very few test kits available for a large number of affected or suspicious individuals. This leads to the need for automatic detection systems that use artificial intelligence. Deep learning is one of the most powerful AI tools available, so we recommend creating a convolutional neural network to detect COVID-19 positive patients from chest radiographs. According to previous studies, lung X-rays of COVID-19-positive patients show obvious characteristics, so this is a reliable method for testing patients, because X-ray examination of suspicious patients is easier than rt-PCR. Our model has been trained with 820 chest radiographic images (excluding data augmentation) collected from 3 databases, with a classification accuracy of 99.45% (training accuracy of 99.70%), sensitivity of 99.30% and specificity of 99.40 %, proved that our model has become a reliable COVID-19 detector.","Asif, S.; Amjad, K.",2020-11-16,Radiology And Imaging,10.1101/2020.11.08.20228080,5,Sohaib Asif,Central South University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.08.20228080v5?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.08.20228080v5.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
6976,Virtual health care for community management of patients with COVID-19.,"ObjectivesTo describe the implementation and early experience of virtual health care for community management of patients with COVID-19.

Designobservational cohort study.

Settinglarge Australian metropolitan health service with established virtual health care program and remote patient monitoring capability.

Participantspatients with COVID-19 living within the health service who can self-isolate safely, do not require immediate admission to an inpatient setting, have no major active comorbid illness and can be managed at home or other suitable accommodation.

Main outcome measurescare escalation rates, including hospital admission.

Resultsbetween 11-29 March 2020, 162/173 (93.6%) locally diagnosed patients with COVID-19 were accepted to the virtual health care program, median age 38y (range 11-79). For the 62 patients discharged during this period the median length of stay was 8 days (range 1-17). The peak of 100 prevalent patients equated to approximately 25 patients per Registered Nurse per shift. Patients were contacted a median of 16 times (range 1-30) during this period, with video consultations used 66.3% of the time; 132/162 (81.5%) patients were monitored remotely. Care escalation rates were low: ambulance attendance, 5 (3%); ED attendance, 4 (2.5%); hospital admission, 3 (1.9%). There were no deaths. Conclusions: community-based virtual health care is feasible for managing most patients with COVID-19 and can be rapidly implemented in an urban Australian context for pandemic management. Health services implementing virtual health care should anticipate challenges with rapid technology deployments and provide adequate support to resolve them including strategies supporting consumer use of health information technologies.","Hutchings, O.; Dearing, C.; Jagers, D.; Shaw, M.; Raffan, F.; Jones, A.; Taggart, R.; Sinclair, T.; Anderson, T.; Ritchie, A.

5636,"Nonpharmaceutical interventions for pandemic COVID-19: A cross-sectional investigation of US general public beliefs, attitudes, and actions","Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) represent the primary mitigation strategy for pandemic COVID-19. Despite this, many government agencies and members of the general public may be resistant to NPI adoption. We sought to understand public attitudes and beliefs regarding various NPIs and self-reported adoption of NPIs, and explore associations between NPI performance and the baseline characteristics of respondents. We performed a cross-sectional age-, sex-, and race- stratified survey of the general US population. Of the 1,005 respondents, 37% (95% CI 34.0, 39.9) felt that NPIs were inconvenient, while only 0.9% (95% CI 0.3, 1.5) of respondents believed that NPIs would not reduce their personal risk of illness. Respondents were most uncertain regarding the efficacy of mask and eye protection use, with 30.6% and 22.1%, respectively, unsure whether their use would slow disease spread. On univariate logistic regression analyses, NPI adherence was associated with a belief that NPIs would reduce personal risk of developing COVID-19 (OR 3.06, 95% CI [1.25, 7.48], p=0.014) and with a belief that the NPIs were not difficult to perform (OR 1.79, 95% CI [1.38, 2.31], p<0.0001). Respondents were compliant with straightforward, familiar, and heavily-encouraged NPI recommendations such as hand-washing; more onerous approaches, such as avoiding face touching, disinfecting surfaces, and wearing masks or goggles, were performed less frequently. NPI non-adherence is associated with both outcome expectations (belief that NPIs are effective) and process expectations (belief that NPIs are not overly inconvenient); these findings have important implications for designing public health outreach efforts, where the feasibility, as well as the effectiveness, of NPIs should be stressed.","Kantor, B.

18475,Clinical and immunological benefits of convalescent plasma therapy in severe COVID-19: insights from a single center open label randomised control trial,"IntroductionA single center open label phase II randomised control trial was done to assess the pathogen and host-intrinsic factors influencing clinical and immunological benefits of passive immunization using convalescent plasma therapy (CPT), in addition to standard of care (SOC) therapy in severe COVID-19 patients, as compared to patients only on SOC therapy.

MethodsConvalescent plasma was collected from patients recovered from COVID-19 following a screening protocol which also included measuring plasma anti SARS-CoV2 spike IgG content. Retrospectively, neutralizing antibody content was measured and proteome was characterized by LC-MS/MS for all convalescent plasma units that were transfused to patients. Severe COVID-19 patients with evidence for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with PaO2/FiO2 ratio 100-300 (moderate ARDS) were recruited and randomised into two parallel arms of SOC and CPT, N=40 in each arm. Peripheral blood samples were collected on the day of enrolment (T1) followed by day3/4 (T2) and day 7 (T3). RT-PCR and sequencing was done for SARS-CoV2 RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs collected at T1. A panel of cytokines and neutralizing antibody content were measured in plasma at all three timepoints. Patients were followed up for 30 days post-admission to assess the primary outcomes of all cause mortality and immunological correlates for clinical benefits.

ResultsWhile across all age-groups no statistically significant clinical benefit was registered for patients in the CPT arm, significant immediate mitigation of hypoxia, reduction in hospital stay as well as survival benefit was recorded in severe COVID-19 patients with ARDS aged less than 67 years receiving convalescent plasma therapy. In addition to its neutralizing antibody content a prominent effect of convalescent plasma on attenuation of systemic cytokine levels possibly contributed to its benefits.

ConclusionPrecise targeting of severe COVID-19 patients is necessary for reaping the clinical benefits of convalescent plasma therapy.

15603,Evolution of COVID-19 cases in selected low- and middle-income countries: have they peaked due to high levels of infection and immunity?,"COVID-19 cases have peaked and declined rapidly in many low- and middle-income countries in recent months, in some cases after control measures were relaxed. For 11 such countries, the hypothesis that these countries have reached herd immunity warrants serious consideration. The Reed-Frost model, perhaps the simplest description for the evolution of cases in an epidemic, with only a few constant parameters, fits the observed case data remarkably well, and yields parameter values that are reasonable. The model results give infection rates of 45% and 79%, above the herd immunity thresholds for each country (under current social distancing conditions). Reproduction numbers range between 1.4 and 2.0, indicating that epidemic curves were ""flattened"" but not ""suppressed"". Between 0.05% and 2.86% of cases have been detected according to the estimates - values which are consistent with findings from serological and T-cell immunity studies. Overall infection fatality ratios for two of three countries studied are lower than expected from reported infection fatality ratios by age (which are based on studies of several high-income countries). COVID-19 may have lower age-specific fatality risks in some countries, due to differences in immune-response, prior exposure to coronaviruses, disease characteristics or other factors. We find that the herd immunity hypothesis would not have fit the evolution of reported cases in several European countries, even just after the initial peaks - and subsequent resurgences of cases obviously prove that those countries have infection rates well below herd immunity levels. Our hypothesis that the 11 countries we studied have reached herd immunity should now be tested further, through serological and T-cell-immunity studies.","Lexmond, A. S.; Nouwen, C.

9993,COVID-19 and first trimester spontaneous abortion: a case-control study of 225 pregnant patients,"BackgroundEvidence for the impact of COVID-19 during the second and the third trimester of pregnancy is limited to a relatively small series, while data on the first trimester are scant. With this study we evaluated COVID-19 infection as a risk factor for spontaneous abortion in first trimester of pregnancy.

MethodsBetween February 22 and May 21, 2020, we conducted a case-control study at S. Anna Hospital, Turin, among first trimester pregnant women, paired for last menstruation. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was compared between women with spontaneous abortion (case group, n=100) and those with ongoing pregnancy (control group, n=125). Current or past infection was determined by detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharingeal swab and SARS- CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies in blood sample. Patient demographics, COVID-19-related symptoms, and the main risk factors for abortion were collected.

FindingsTwenty-three (10.2%) of the 225 women tested positive for COVID-19 infection. There was no difference in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 between the cases (11/100, 11%) and the controls (12/125, 9.6%) (p=0.73). Logistic regression analysis confirmed that COVID-19 was not an independent predictor of abortion (1.28 confidence interval 0.53-3.08).

InterpretationCOVID-19 infection during the first trimester of pregnancy does not appear to predispose to abortion; its cumulative incidence did not differ from that of women with ongoing pregnancy.","Cosma, S.; Carosso, A.; Cusato, J.; Borella, F.; Carosso, M.; Bovetti, M.; Filippini, C.; D'avolio, A.; Ghisetti, V.; Di Perri, G.; Benedetto, C.",2020-06-20,Obstetrics And Gynecology,10.1101/2020.06.19.20135749,1,Stefano Cosma,"Gynecology and Obstetrics 1, Department of Surgical Sciences, City of Health and Science, University of Turin, Turin, Italy",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.19.20135749v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.19.20135749v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

This international qualitative study captured the global impact on vascular patient care during the first pandemic  wave.

MethodsAn online structured survey was used to collect regular unit-level data regarding the modification to a wide range of vascular services and treatment pathways on a global scale.

ResultsThe survey commenced on 23rd March 2020 worldwide. Over six weeks, 249 vascular units took part in 53 countries (465 individual responses). Overall, 65% of units stopped carotid surgery for anyone except patients with crescendo symptoms or offered surgery on a case-by-case basis, 25% only intervened for symptomatic aortic aneurysms cancelling all  elective repairs. For patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease 60% of units moved to an endovascular-first strategy. For patients who had previously undergone endovascular aortic aneurysm repair, 31.8% of units stopped all postoperative surveillance. Of those units regularly engaging in multidisciplinary team meetings, 59.5% of units stopped regular meetings and 39.1% had not replaced them. Further, 20% of units did not have formal personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines in place and 25% reported insufficient PPE availability.

8595,Potential impact of Covid-19 response measures on invasive pneumococcal disease in England and Wales,"ObjectivesIn January 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) removed one of the two infant doses of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), leaving a single priming dose at 3 months and a 12 month booster. We modelled the potential impact on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) of a drop in PCV13 coverage associated with the restrictions on non-essential health care visits introduced to combat COVID-19 in the UK on 23 March 2020.

DesignUsing a previously published model of pneumococcal transmission in England and Wales we simulated the impact of reducing PCV13 coverage by 50% for 3 months from 23 March without subsequent catch-up vaccination. To implement social distancing, we reduced mixing between and within age-groups by either 10% or 50%. In a sensitivity analysis we explored the effect of complete cessation of PCV13 vaccination during the ""lockdown"" and of extending its duration to 6 months.

Main outcome measuresAnnual numbers of IPD cases predicted by the model under different vaccination and ""lockdown"" scenarios with uncertainty intervals (UI) generated from the minimum and maximum values of the model predictions using 500 parameter sets with values within a pre-specified range of the maximum likelihood set.

ResultsThe model predicted that any increase in IPD cases from a reduction in PCV13 coverage would be more than offset by a reduction in pneumococcal transmission due to social distancing, with a net reduction in cumulative IPD cases (UI -1,479, -1,061, all ages) over the next five years. Similar results were obtained in the sensitivity analysis, though with a greater reduction with a 6 month ""lockdown"".

ConclusionCOVID-19 social distancing measures are predicted to have had a profound effect on pneumococcal transmission resulting in a reduction in pneumococcal carriage prevalence and IPD incidence over the first two years after the ""lockdown"". Carriage studies will be informative in confirming the predicted impact of the social distancing measures after they have been lifted.","Choi, Y.

6236,Incorporating and Addressing Testing Bias Within Estimates of Epidemic Dynamics for SARS-CoV-2,"The disease burden of SARS-CoV-2 as measured by tests from various countries present varying estimates of infection and fatality rates. Models based on these acquired data may suffer from systematic errors and large estimation variances due to the biases associated with testing and lags between the infection and death counts. Here, we present an augmented compartment model to predict epidemic dynamics while explicitly modeling for the sampling bias involved in testing. Our simulations show that sampling biases in favor of patients with higher disease manifestation could significantly affect direct estimates of infection and fatality rates calculated from the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths, and serological testing can partially mitigate these biased estimates. We further recommend a strategy to obtain unbiased estimates, calculating the dependence of expected confidence on a randomized sample size, showing that relatively small sample sizes can provide statistically significant estimates for SARS-CoV-2 related death rates.","Suhail, Y.; Afzal, J.; Kshitiz,  ",2020-05-06,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.02.20088120,1,Kshitiz,University of Connecticut Health,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.02.20088120v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.02.20088120v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA

We aimed to explore the contribution of structural factors of nursing home facilities and the surrounding district to all-cause and Covid-19-related deaths during a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, we investigated the risk factors of Covid-19 mortality at the facility level in nursing homes in Catalonia (North-East Spain). The investigated factors included characteristics of the residents (age, gender, comorbidities, and complexity and/or advanced disease), structural features of the nursing home (total number of residents, residents who return home during the pandemic, and capacity for pandemic response, based on an ad hoc score of availability of twelve essential items for implementing preventive measures), and sociodemographic profile of the catchment district (household income, population density, and population incidence of Covid-19). Study endpoints included all-cause death and Covid-19-related death (either PCR-confirmed or clinical suspicion).

FindingsThe analysis included 167 nursing homes that provide long-term care to 8,716 residents. Between March 1 and June 1, 2020, 1,629 deaths were reported in these nursing homes; 1,089 (66{square}9%) of them were Covid-19-confirmed. The multivariable regression showed a higher risk of death associated with a higher percentage of complex patients (HR 1{square}09; 95%CI 1{square}05-1{square}12 per 10% increase) or those with advanced diseases (1{square}13; 1{square}07-1{square}19), lower capacity for implementing preventive measures (1{square}08; 1{square}05-1{square}10 per 1-point increase), and districts with a higher incidence of Covid-19 (2{square}98; 2{square}53-3{square}50 per 1000 cases/100,000 population increase). A higher population density of the catchment area was a protective factor (0{square}60; 0{square}50-0{square}72 per log10 people/Km2 increase).

InterpretationPresence of residents with complex/advance disease, low capacity for pandemic response and location in areas with high incidence of Covid-19 are risk factors for Covid-19 mortality in nursing homes and may help policymakers to prioritize preventative interventions for pandemic containment.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for studies exploring the management of Covid-19 in long-term care settings. The search was performed on May 1, 2020, and included the keywords ""Covid-19"", ""nursing home"", ""long term care"", and ""skilled nursing facility"" with no language restriction. In addition to descriptive reports of Covid-19 mortality in the long-term care setting, we found studies providing evidence on the influence of age and comorbidities to mortality at the individual level. Some authors reported comparisons in the incidence and mortality of Covid-19 between facilities and country areas, and suggested the characteristics of each area/facility that may explain differences in mortality. However, we found no published works specifically investigating the contribution of structural features of the facility and sociodemographic characteristics of the area to explaining differences in Covid-19 mortality among long-term care facilities.

Added value of this studyThis is the first analysis of risk of mortality at a facility level of residents with Covid-19 in nursing homes. We enrolled up to 167 nursing homes providing long-term care to 8,716 residents and we actively identified risk factors for Covid-19 mortality at the facility level. We found that nursing homes with lower capacity for pandemic response, and located in districts with a higher incidence of Covid-19 had significantly higher risks of Covid-19 mortality. The percentage of complex and/or advanced disease patients was also a risk factor.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur findings provide policymakers with critical information to prioritize long-term care facilities at higher risk when deploying preventative interventions to minimize mortality in this setting. The association between mortality within the nursing home and Covid-19 incidence in the catchment area reinforces the importance of preventing the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into facilities. Nursing homes with limited capacity to implement containment measures should be prioritized when deploying preventative interventions for minimizing Covid-19 mortality in long-term care facilities.","Suner, C.; Ouchi, D.; Mas, M.

13418,Assessment of physiological signs associated with COVID-19 measured using wearable devices,"Respiration rate, heart rate, and heart rate variability are some health metrics that are easily measured by consumer devices and which can potentially provide early signs of illness. Furthermore, mobile applications which accompany wearable devices can be used to collect relevant self-reported symptoms and demographic data. This makes consumer devices a valuable tool in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. We considered two approaches to assessing COVID-19 - a symptom-based approach, and a physiological signs based technique. Firstly, we trained a Logistic Regression classifier to predict the need for hospitalization of COVID-19 patients given the symptoms experienced, age, sex, and BMI. Secondly, we trained a neural network classifier to predict whether a person is sick on any specific day given respiration rate, heart rate, and heart rate variability data for that day and and for the four preceding days. Data on 1,181 subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 (active infection, PCR test) were collected from May 21 - July 14, 2020. 11.0% of COVID-19 subjects were asymptomatic, 47.2% of subjects recovered at home by themselves, 33.2% recovered at home with the help of someone else, 8.16% of subjects required hospitalization without ventilation support, and 0.448% required ventilation. Fever was present in 54.8% of subjects. Based on self-reported symptoms alone, we obtained an AUC of 0.77 {+/-} 0.05 for the prediction of the need for hospitalization. Based on physiological signs, we obtained an AUC of 0.77 {+/-} 0.03 for the prediction of illness on a specific day with 4 previous days of history. Respiration rate and heart rate are typically elevated by illness, while heart rate variability is decreased. Measuring these metrics can help in early diagnosis, and in monitoring the progress of the disease.","Natarajan, A.; Su, H.-W.; Heneghan, C.",2020-08-16,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.08.14.20175265,1,Aravind Natarajan,Fitbit,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20175265v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20175265v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1038/s41746-020-00363-7
8585,Serological surveys in Reunion Island of the first hospitalized patients revealed that long-lived immunoglobulin G antibodies specific against SARS-CoV2 virus are rapidly vanishing in severe cases,"Both cellular and humoral immunities are critically important to control COVID19 infection but little is known about the kinetics of those responses and, in particular, in patients who will go on to develop a severe form of the disease over several weeks. We herein report the first set of data of our prospective cohort study of 90 hospitalized cases. Serological surveys were thoroughly performed over 2 month period by assessing IgG and IgM responses by immunofluorescence, immunoblot, Western blot and conventional ELISA using clinical RUN isolates of SARS-CoV-2 immobilized on 96 well plates. While the IgM and, unexpectedly, the IgG responses were readily detected early during the course of the disease (5-7 days post-first symptoms), our results (n=3-5 and over the full dilution set of the plasma 1/200 to 1/12800) demonstrated a significant decrease (over 2.5-fold) of IgG levels in severe (ICU) hospitalized patients (exemplified in patient 1) by WB and ELISA. In contrast, mild non-ICU patients had a steady and yet robust rise in their specific IgG levels against the virus. Interestingly, both responses (IgM and IgG) were initially against the nucleocapsid (50kDa band on the WB) and spreading to other major viral protein S and domains (S1 and S2. In conclusion, serological testing may be helpful for the diagnosis of patients with negative RT-PCR results and for the identification of asymptomatic cases. Moreover, medical care and protections should be maintained particularly for recovered patients (severe cases) who may remain at risk of relapsing or reinfection. Experiments to ascertain T cell responses but although their kinetics overtime are now highly warranted. All in all, these studies will help to delineate the best routes for vaccination.","Dobi, A.; Frumence, E.; Lalarizo Rakoto, M.; Lebeau, G.; Vagner, D.; Sandenon Seteyen, A.-L.; Giry, C.; Septembre-Malaterre, A.; Jaffar-Bandjee, M.-C.; Raffray, L.; Gasque, P.",2020-06-02,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.25.20112623,1,Philippe Gasque,"Unite de recherche en Pharmaco-Immunologie (UR-EPI), Universite et CHU de la Reunion, St Denis",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.25.20112623v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.25.20112623v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
4350,Modeling COVID-19: Forecasting and analyzing the dynamics of the outbreak in Hubei and Turkey,"As the pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) rages throughout the world, accurate modeling of the dynamics thereof is essential. However, since the availability and quality of data varies dramatically from region to region, accurate modeling directly from a global perspective is difficult, if not altogether impossible. Nevertheless, via local data collected by certain regions, it is possible to develop accurate local prediction tools, which may be coupled to develop global models.

In this study, we analyze the dynamics of local outbreaks of COVID-19 via a coupled system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Utilizing the large amount of data available from the ebbing outbreak in Hubei, China as a testbed, we estimate the basic reproductive number,[R] 0 of COVID-19 and predict the total cases, total deaths, and other features of the Hubei outbreak with a high level of accuracy. Through numerical experiments, we observe the effects of quarantine, social distancing, and COVID-19 testing on the dynamics of the outbreak. Using knowledge gleaned from the Hubei outbreak, we apply our model to analyze the dynamics of outbreak in Turkey. We provide forecasts for the peak of the outbreak and the total number of cases/deaths in Turkey, for varying levels of social distancing, quarantine, and COVID-19 testing.","Aslan, I.

20916,Emergence and fast spread of B.1.1.7 lineage in Lebanon.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains a rapid spread emerging disease. Recently, a new variant of this virus called SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 (or B.1.1.7 lineage), described in the United Kingdom (UK), has become highly prevalent in several countries. Its rate of transmission has been estimated to be greatly higher. B.1.1.7 lineage harbors 23 mutations co-existed for the first time in the same variant. Herein, we are interested only by the deletion mutation {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70 in the spike protein.

In the UK they were able to identify the increase of this new variant through the increase in the false negative result for the spike target of a three-target RT-PCR assay from Thermo Fisher Scientific (TaqPath kit). Later, the manufacturer announced that this false negative result is because of the deletion {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70 in the area targeted by the TaqPath Kit. Furthermore, The European CDC recommended that the use of this kit help to track the new variant.

Genome sequencing is the gold method to confirm the new variant, but observational studies provide also stronger evidence if similar models are observed in multiple countries, especially when randomized studies are not possible. In Lebanon, the highest number of confirmed cases were reported in first week of 2021. In the present study, we show the emergence and the fast spreading of the new variant in Lebanon and a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 transmission intensity and the frequency of the new variant during the first twelve days of January.","Younes, M.; Hamze, K.; Nassar, H.; Makki, M.; Ghaddar, M.; Nguewa, P.; Abdel Sater, F.",2021-01-26,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.01.25.21249974,1,Fadi Abdel Sater,"Lebanese university, Molecular Biology and cancer Immunology",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.25.21249974v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.25.21249974v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
17153,Major new lineages of SARS-CoV-2 emerge and spread in South Africa during lockdown.,"In March 2020, the first cases of COVID-19 were reported in South Africa. The epidemic spread very fast despite an early and extreme lockdown and infected over 600,000 people, by far the highest number of infections in an African country. To rapidly understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in South Africa, we formed the Network for Genomics Surveillance in South Africa (NGS-SA). Here, we analyze 1,365 high quality whole genomes and identify 16 new lineages of SARS-CoV-2. Most of these unique lineages have mutations that are found hardly anywhere else in the world. We also show that three lineages spread widely in South Africa and contributed to [~]42% of all of the infections in the country. This included the first identified C lineage of SARS-CoV-2, C.1, which has 16 mutations as compared with the original Wuhan sequence. C.1 was the most geographically widespread lineage in South Africa, causing infections in multiple provinces and in all of the eleven districts in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), the most sampled province. Interestingly, the first South-African specific lineage, B.1.106, which was identified in April 2020, became extinct after nosocomial outbreaks were controlled. Our findings show that genomic surveillance can be implemented on a large scale in Africa to identify and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Tegally, H.; Wilkinson, E.; Lessells, R.

3841,A model to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the first three-month surveillance data in Brazil.,"BackgroundCOVID-19 diagnosis is a critical problem, mainly due to the lack or delay in the test results. We aimed to obtain a model to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection in suspected patients reported to the Brazilian surveillance system.

MethodsWe analyzed suspected patients reported to the National Surveillance System that corresponded to the following case definition: patients with respiratory symptoms and fever, who traveled to regions with local or community transmission or who had close contact with a suspected or confirmed case. Based on variables routinely collected, we obtained a multiple model using logistic regression. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy indicators were used for validation.

ResultsWe described 1468 COVID-19 cases (confirmed by RT-PCR) and 4271 patients with other illnesses. With a data subset, including 80% of patients from Sao Paulo (SP) and Rio Janeiro (RJ), we obtained a function which reached an AUC of 95.54% (95% CI: 94.41% - 96.67%) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and accuracy of 90.1% (sensitivity 87.62% and specificity 92.02%). In a validation dataset including the other 20% of patients from SP and RJ, this model exhibited an AUC of 95.01% (92.51% - 97.5%) and accuracy of 89.47% (sensitivity 87.32% and specificity 91.36%).

ConclusionWe obtained a model suitable for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 based on routinely collected surveillance data. Applications of this tool include early identification for specific treatment and isolation, rational use of laboratory tests, and input for modeling epidemiological trends.","Diaz-Quijano, F.

7186,COVID-19 OUTCOMES IN MS: EARLY EXPERIENCE FROM NYU MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS COMPREHENSIVE CARE CENTER,"ObjectiveReport outcomes on patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and related disorders with COVID-19 illness.

MethodsFrom March 16 to April 30th, 2020, patients with MS or related disorders at NYU Langone MS Comprehensive Care Center (MSCC) were identified with laboratory-confirmed or suspected COVID-19. The diagnosis was established using a standardized questionnaire or by review of in-patient hospital records.

ResultsWe identified 76 patients (55 with relapsing MS of which 9 had pediatric-onset;17 with progressive MS; and 4 with related disorders). 37 underwent PCR testing and were confirmed positive. Of the entire group, 64 (84%) patients were on disease-modifying therapy (DMT) including anti-CD20 therapies (n=34, 44.7%) and sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators (n=10, 13.5%). The most common COVID-19 symptoms were fever and cough, but 21.1% of patients had neurologic symptom recrudescence preceding or coinciding with the infection. A total of 18 (23.7%) were hospitalized; 8 (10.5%) had COVID-19 critical illness or related death. Features more common among those hospitalized or with critical illness or death were older age, presence of comorbidities, progressive disease, and a non-ambulatory status. No DMT class was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or fatal outcome.

ConclusionsMost MS patients with COVID-19 do not require hospitalization despite being on DMTs. Factors associated with critical illness were similar to the general  at risk patient population. DMT use did not emerge as a predictor of poor COVID-19 outcome in this preliminary sample.","Parrotta, E.; Kister, I.; Charvet, L.; Sammarco, C.; Saha, V.; Charlson, R. E.; Howard, J.; Gutman, J.

8258,COVID-19: The unreasonable effectiveness of simple models,"When the novel coronavirus disease SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) was officially declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020, the scientific community had already braced up in the effort of making sense of the fast-growing wealth of data gathered by national authorities all over the world. However, despite the diversity of novel theoretical approaches and the comprehensiveness of many widely established models, the official figures that recount the course of the outbreak still sketch a largely elusive and intimidating picture. Here we show unambiguously that the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak belongs to the simple universality class of the SIR model and extensions thereof. Our analysis naturally leads us to establish that there exists a fundamental limitation to any theoretical approach, namely the unpredictable non-stationarity of the testing frames behind the reported figures. However, we show how such bias can be quantified self-consistently and employed to mine useful and accurate information from the data. In particular, we describe how the time evolution of the reporting rates controls the occurrence of the apparent epidemic peak, which typically follows the true one in countries that were not vigorous enough in their testing at the onset of the outbreak. The importance of testing early and resolutely appears as a natural corollary of our analysis, as countries that tested massively at the start clearly had their true peak earlier and less deaths overall.","Carletti, T.; Fanelli, D.; Piazza, F.",2020-05-27,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.26.20110957,1,Francesco Piazza,University of Orleans,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.26.20110957v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.26.20110957v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.csfx.2020.100034
14225,Health and economic effects of COVID-19 control in Australia: Modelling and quantifying the payoffs of hard versus soft lockdown,"Objective(s)Australia requires high quality evidence to optimise likely health and economy outcomes to effectively manage the current resurgence of COVID-19. We hypothesise that the most stringent social distancing (SD) measures (100% of level in Australia in April 2020) deliver better public health and economy outcomes.

Design Fit-for-purpose (individual-based and compartment) models were used to simulate the effects of different SD and detection strategies on Australian COVID-19 infections and the economy from March to July 2020. Public reported COVID-19 data were used to estimate model parameters.

Main outcome measuresPublic health and economy outcomes for multiple social distancing levels were evaluated, assessing ""hard"" versus ""soft"" lockdowns, and for early versus later relaxation of social distancing. Outcomes included costs and the timing and magnitude of observed COVID-19 cases and cumulative deaths in Australia from March to June 2020.

ResultsHigher levels of social distancing achieve zero community transmission with 100% probability and lower economy cost while low levels of social distancing result in uncontrolled outbreaks and higher economy costs. High social distancing total economy costs were $17.4B versus $41.2B for 0.7 social distancing. Early relaxation of suppression results in worse public health outcomes and higher economy costs.

Conclusion(s)Better public health outcomes (reduced COVID-19 fatalities) are positively associated with lower economy costs and higher levels of social distancing; achieving zero community transmission lowers both public health and economy costs compared to allowing community transmission to continue; and early relaxation of social distancing increases both public health and economy costs.

SignificanceThe known is that COVID-19 infections can be suppressed with social distancing (SD) measures of sufficient stringency and duration.

The new is we find highest levels of SD (100% SD that prevailed in April 2020) generate much lower COVID-9 deaths; reduced SD days; increased economic activity; and much higher probability of elimination over a subsequent 12-month period than lower levels of SD.

The implications are that greater levels of SD are preferred to lower SD because they deliver both better public health and lower economy costs.","Grafton, Q.; Kompas, T.; Parslow, J.; Glass, K.; Banks, E.; Lokuge, K.",2020-09-02,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.31.20185587,1,Quentin Grafton,Australian National University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.20185587v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.20185587v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

A Case Study with Nigeria,"In this article, we formulated a mathematical model for the spread of the COVID-19 disease and we introduced quarantined and isolated compartments. The next generation matrix method was adopted to compute the basic reproduction number (R0) in order to assess the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 deadly disease. Stability analysis of the disease free equilibrium is investigated based on the basic reproduction number and the result shows that it is locally and asymptotically stable for R0 less than 1. Numerical calculation of the basic reproduction number revealed that R0 < 1 which means that the disease can be eradicated from Nigeria.

Based on our previous pilot study conducted in Gandhinagar district of Gujarat state, we developed a new research protocol to understand SAR statistics in household contacts of COVID-19 cases that died/expired. The details of expired COVID positive primary cases were obtained from Government records and the details of secondary cases were retrieved using telephonic interviews of the household members. Forty-nine expired cases were registered between March to August, 2020. Out of 49 deaths, 28 families could be reached on phone. Rest were not reachable or refused to give information. These were interviewed after taking verbal consent. The study reported 25% SAR in household contact of expired primary cases with 7.4% of mortality in secondary cases.

18876,"Galectin antagonist use in mild cases of SARS-CoV-2; pilot feasibility randomised, open label, controlled trial","ImportanceNovel SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected nearly half a billion people across the world and is highly contagious. There is a need for a novel mechanism to block viral entry and stop its replication.

BackgroundSpike protein N terminal domain (NTD) of the novel SARS-CoV-2 is essential for viral entry and replication in human cell. Thus the S1 NTD of human coronavirus family, which is similar to a galectin binding site - human galactose binding lectins, is a potential novel target for early treatment in COVID-19.

ObjectivesTo study the feasibility of performing a definitive trial of using galectin antagonist - Prolectin-M as treatment for mild, symptomatic, rRT-PCR positive, COVID-19.

Main outcomes and measuresCycle threshold (Ct) value is number of cycles needed to express fluorescence, on real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Ct values expressed for RNA polymerase (Rd/RP) gene +Nucleocapsid gene and the small envelope (E) genes determine infectivity of the individual. A digital droplet PCR based estimation of the Nucleocapid genes (N1+N2) in absolute copies/L determines active viral replication.

Design and interventionPilot Feasibility Randomised Controlled Open-Label, parallel arm, study. Oral tablets of Prolectin-M were administered along with the best practice, Standard of Care (SoC) and compared against SoC. Voluntarily, consenting individuals, age >18 years, and able to provide frequent nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were randomly allocated by REDCap software.

The intervention, Prolectin-M was administered as a multi dose regime of 4 gram tablets. Each tablet contained 2 grams of (1-6)-Alpha-D-mannopyranosil mixed with 2 grams of dietary fibre. Each participant took a single chewable tablet every hour, to a maximum of 10 hours in a day. Tablets were administered only during the daytime, for total of 5 days.

ResultsThis pilot trial demonstrated the feasibility to recruit and randomize participants. By day 7, following treatment with Prolectin-M, Ct value of Rd/Rp + N gene increased by16.41 points, 95% (CI - 0.3527 to 32.48, p=0.047). Similarly, small envelope (E) gene also increased by 17.75 points (95% CI;-0.1321 to 35.63, p = 0.05). The expression of N1, N2 genes went below detectable thresholds by day 3 (Mann Whitney U = 0.000, p<0.029).

rRT-PCR testing done in the clinic on day 1, 7, and 14 had 3 participants (60%) turn negative by day 7 and all turned negative by day 14 and stayed negative until day 28. In the SoC group 2 participants had zero detectable viral loads at baseline, 2 participants tested negative on day 14, and the last participant tested remained positive on day 28. There were no serious adverse events, and all participants were clinically asymptomatic before day 28 with reactive immunoglobulin G (IgG).

Trial relevanceThis pilot study proves that it is feasible and safe to perform a trial using a Galectin antagonist in COVID-19. This is a novel mechanism for blocking viral entry and its subsequent replication.

16372,SARS-CoV-2 sequencing reveals rapid transmission from college student clusters resulting in morbidity and deaths in vulnerable populations,"College reopening decisions during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represent a trade-off between competing risks to students, faculty and staff, and college finances. Additionally, risks taken in reopening colleges can impose significant burdens on individuals living in surrounding communities. Many colleges that reopened for in-person instruction have reported frequent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. La Crosse County, Wisconsin experienced a substantial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (2,002 cases in September 2020) that coincided with the return to in-person instruction at three local academic institutions. Genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 cases in La Crosse during that period found rapid expansion of two viral substrains. Although the majority of cases were among college-age individuals, from a total of 111 genomes sequenced we identified rapid transmission of the virus into more vulnerable populations. Eight sampled genomes represented two independent transmission events into two skilled nursing facilities, resulting in two fatalities. Our study highlights the very significant risks imposed by college administrator reopening decisions, not just on college-associated populations, but on vulnerable individuals in surrounding communities.","Richmond, C.

6829,Outcomes among HIV-positive patients hospitalized with COVID-19,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 infection continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preliminary data on SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that some immunocompromised hosts experience worse outcomes. We performed a retrospective matched cohort study to characterize outcomes in HIV-positive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsLeveraging data collected from electronic medical records for all patients hospitalized at NYU Langone Health with COVID-19 between March 2, 2020 and April 23, 2020, we matched 21 HIV-positive patients to 42 non-HIV patients using a greedy nearest neighbor algorithm. Admission characteristics, laboratory results, and hospital outcomes were recorded and compared between the two groups.

ResultsWhile there was a trend toward increased rates of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in HIV-positive patients, these differences were not statistically significant. Rates for these outcomes in our cohort are similar to those previously published for all patients hospitalized with COVID-19. HIV-positive patients had significantly higher admission and peak CRP values. Other inflammatory markers did not differ significantly between groups, though HIV-positive patients tended to have higher peak values during their clinical course. Three HIV-positive patients had superimposed bacterial pneumonia with positive sputum cultures, and all three patients expired during hospitalization. There was no difference in frequency of thrombotic events or myocardial infarction between these groups.

ConclusionThis study provides evidence that HIV coinfection does not significantly impact presentation, hospital course, or outcomes of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, when compared to matched non-HIV patients. A larger study is required to determine if the trends we observed apply to all HIV-positive patients.","Karmen-Tuohy, S.; Carlucci, P. M.; Zacharioudakis, I. M.; Zervou, F.

4048,The Framework for the Prediction of the Critical Turning Period for Outbreak of COVID-19 Spread in China based on the iSEIR Model,"The goal of this study is to establish a general framework for predicting the so-called critical ""Turning Period"" in an infectious disease epidemic such as the COVID-19 outbreak in China early this year. This framework enabled a timely prediction of the turning period when applied to Wuhan COVID-19 epidemic and informed the relevant authority for taking appropriate and timely actions to control the epidemic. It is expected to provide insightful information on turning period for the worlds current battle against the COVID-19 pandemic.

The underlying mathematical model in our framework is the individual Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Removed (iSEIR) model, which is a set of differential equations extending the classic SEIR model. We used the observed daily cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan from February 6 to 10, 2020 as the input to the iSEIR model and were able to generate the trajectory of COVID-19 cases dynamics for the following days at midnight of February 10 based on the updated model, from which we predicted that the turning period of CIVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan would arrive within one week after February 14. This prediction turned to be timely and accurate, providing adequate time for the government, hospitals, essential industry sectors and services to meet peak demands and to prepare aftermath planning.

Our study also supports the observed effectiveness on flatting the epidemic curve by decisively imposing the ""Lockdown and Isolation Control Program"" in Wuhan since January 23, 2020. The Wuhan experience provides an exemplary lesson for the whole world to learn in combating COVID-19.","Yuan, G.

13066,Compound risks of hurricane evacuation amid the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States,"Current projections and unprecedented storm activity to date suggest the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season will be extremely active and that a major hurricane could make landfall during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Such an event would necessitate a large-scale evacuation, with implications for the trajectory of the pandemic. Here we model how a hypothetical hurricane evacuation from four counties in southeast Florida would affect COVID-19 case levels. We find that hurricane evacuation increases the total number of COVID-19 cases in both origin and destination locations; however, if transmission rates in destination counties can be kept from rising during evacuation, excess evacuation-induced case numbers can be minimized by directing evacuees to counties experiencing lower COVID-19 transmission rates. Ultimately, the number of excess COVID-19 cases produced by the evacuation depends on the ability of destination counties to meet evacuee needs while minimizing virus exposure through public health directives.","Pei, S.; Dahl, K.

However, our knowledge of (dis)similarities between this one and other viral agents is still very limited. Here we compare the novel coronavirus PPI network against 45 known viruses, from the perspective of statistical physics. Our results show that classic analysis such as percolation is not sensitive to the distinguishing features of viruses, whereas the analysis of biochemical spreading patterns allows us to meaningfully categorize the viruses and quantitatively compare their impact on human proteins. Remarkably, when Gibbsian-like density matrices are used to represent each systems state, the corresponding macroscopic statistical properties measured by the spectral entropy reveals the existence of clusters of viruses at multiple scales. Overall, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits similarities to viruses like SARS-CoV and Influenza A at small scales, while at larger scales it exhibits more similarities to viruses such as HIV1 and HTLV1.","Ghavasieh, A.; Bontorin, S.; Artime, O.; De Domenico, M.",2020-09-08,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.09.06.20189266,1,Manlio De Domenico,Fondazione Bruno Kessler,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.20189266v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.20189266v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
5635,Fast and easy disinfection of coronavirus-contaminated face masks using ozone gas produced by a dielectric barrier discharge plasma generator,"Face masks are one of the currently available options for preventing the transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has caused the 2019 pandemic. However, with the increasing demand for protection, face masks are becoming limited in stock, and the concerned individuals and healthcare workers from many countries are now facing the issue of the reuse of potentially contaminated masks. Although various technologies already exist for the sterilization of medical equipment, most of them are not applicable for eliminating virus from face masks. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a fast and easy method of disinfecting contaminated face masks. In this study, using a human coronavirus (HCoV-229E) as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 contamination on face masks, we show that the virus loses its infectivity to a human cell line (MRC-5) when exposed for a short period of time (1 min) to ozone gas produced by a dielectric barrier discharge plasma generator. Scanning electron microscopy and particulate filtration efficiency (PFE) tests revealed that there was no structural or functional deterioration observed in the face masks even after they underwent excessive exposure to ozone (five 1-minute exposures). Interestingly, for face masks exposed to ozone gas for 5 min, the amplification of HCoV-229E RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction suggested a loss of infectivity under the effect of ozone, primarily owing to the damage caused to viral envelopes or envelope proteins. Ozone gas is a strong oxidizing agent with the ability to kill viruses on hard-to-reach surfaces, including the fabric structure of face masks. These results suggest that it may be possible to rapidly disinfect contaminated face masks using a plasma generator in a well-ventilated place.","Lee, J.; Bong, C.; Bae, P. K.; Abafog, A.

19387,"Influence of clinical characteristics and anti-cancer therapy on outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 5,678 cancer patients","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic started a healthcare crisis and heavily impacted cancer services.

MethodsData from cohort studies of COVID-19 cancer patients published up until October 23rd 2020 from PubMed, PubMed Central, medRxiv and Google Scholar were reviewed. Meta-analyses using the random effects model was performed to assess the risk of death in cancer patients with COVID-19.

ResultsOur meta-analyses including up to 5,678 patients from 13 studies showed that the following were all statistically significant risk factors for death following SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients: age of 65 and above, presence of co-morbidities, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes and hypertension. There was no evidence that patients who had received cancer treatment within 60 days of their COVID-19 diagnosis were at a higher risk of death, including patients who had recent chemotherapy.

ConclusionsCancer patients are susceptible to severe COVID-19, especially older patients and patients with co-morbidities who will require close monitoring. Our findings support the continued administration of anti-cancer therapy during the pandemic. The analysis of chemotherapy was powered at 70% to detect an effect size of 1.2 but all other anti-cancer treatments had lower power.

16357,CORRELATION BETWEEN SARS-COV-2 ANTIBODY SCREENING BY IMMUNOASSAY AND NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY TESTING,"BackgroundPassive antibody therapy with convalescent plasma (CP) represents a promising alternative for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The efficacy of CP therapy has been associated with high titers of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in the plasma of recovered patients, but the assays for quantifying nAbs are not widely available. Our goal was to develop a strategy to predict high titers of nAbs based on the results of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays and the clinical characteristics of the CP potential donors.

MethodsTwo hundred and fourteen CP donors were enrolled and tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two commercial immunoassays (IA): Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG EUROIMMUN and Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Chemiluminescence IgG Abbott. In parallel, quantification of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) was performed using the Cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization test (CPE-VNT). Three criteria for identifying donors with high titers of nAbs ([&ge;]1:160) were tested: - Criterion1: Curve ROC Method; - Criterion 2: Conditional decision tree considering only the results from the IA and -Criterion 3: Conditional decision tree including both the IA results and the clinical variables.

ResultsThe performance of Abbott and EUROIMMUN immunoassays was similar referring to both S/CO and predictive value for identifying nAbs titers [&ge;] 1:160. Regarding the three studied criteria for identifying CP donors with high nAbs titers ([&ge;] 1:160): 1) Criterion 1 showed 76.1% accuracy when the S/CO cut-off of 4.65 was used, 2) Criterion 2 presented 76.1% accuracy if the S/CO [&ge;] 4.57 was applied and 3) Criterion 3 had 71.6% accuracy if either S/CO [&ge;] 4.57 or S/CO between 2.68 and 4.57 and the last COVID-19-related symptoms occurred less than 19 days from donor recruiting were used.

ConclusionThe results of SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays (S/CO) can be used to predict high nAbs titers of potential CP donors. This study has proposed three different criteria for identifying donors with [&ge;] 1:160 nAbs titer based on either solely S/CO results or S/CO together with clinical variables, all with high efficacy and accuracy.","Mendrone-Junior, A.; Dinardo, C.; Ferreira, S.; Nishia, A.; Salles, N.; Almeida-Neto, C.; Hamasaki, D.; Facincani, T.; Alves, L.; Machado, R.; Araujo, D.; Durigon, E.; Rocha, V.; Sabino, E.",2020-10-14,Hematology,10.1101/2020.10.11.20210005,1,Carla Dinardo,FUNDACAO PRO SANGUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.11.20210005v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.11.20210005v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1111/trf.16268

In this retrospective study the clinical characteristics of 215 COVID-19 patients were correlated with the peripheral blood immune status.

Different groups of COVID-19 patients may be identified on the basis of clinical behavior and a strong correlation between groups and age and comorbidities as well as with the immune profile is demonstrated. A lower age correlates with a lower severity of the disease differentiating between patients who may be quarantined at home and those requiring hospitalization. An older age (>82 years) together with a higher number of comorbidities is associated to a very severe prognosis. The absolute number of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes was progressively decreasing according to the severity of the disease and a CD3+ and CD8+ threshold indicating very severe cases is suggested.","Santoro, N.; Cignetti, A.; Tenace, V.; Casonato, I.

4759,Social interventions can lower COVID-19 deaths in middle-income countries,"Summary paragraphA novel pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first detected in late 2019 in Wuhan (China)1,2. COVID-19 has caused 77 national governments worldwide to impose a lockdown in part or all their countries, as of April 4, 20203. The United States and the United Kingdom estimated the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce COVID-19 deaths, but there is less evidence to support choice of control measures in middle-income countries4. We used Colombia, an upper-middle income country, as a case-study to assess the effect of social interventions to suppress or mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we show that a combination of social distancing interventions, triggered by critical care admissions, can suppress and mitigate the peak of COVID-19, resulting in less critical care use, hospitalizations, and deaths. We found, through a mathematical simulation model, that a one-time social intervention may delay the number of critical care admissions and deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a series of social interventions (social and work distance and school closures) over a period of a year can reduce the expected burden of COVID-19, however, these interventions imply long periods of lockdown. Colombia would prevent up to 97% of COVID-19 deaths using these triggered series of interventions during the first year. Our analyses could be used by decision-makers from other middle-income countries with similar demographics and contact patterns to Colombia to reduce COVID-19 critical care admissions and deaths in their jurisdictions.","Paternina-Caicedo, A.

4210,A Stratified Model to Quantify the Effects of Containment Policies on the Spread of COVID-19,"BackgroundThe SARS-Cov-2 virus is spreading fast all over the world and has already imposed a significant social and economic cost in many countries. Different countries have utilised a variety of containment policies with an emphasis on social distancing as a strategy to stop the spread of COVID-19. Quantifying the effects of such policies in different time-scales and comparing the efficacy of various available policies is of utmost importance for policy-makers in different countries. That is even more important when the policy-makers want to plan for long-term strategies and to weigh each option based on its epidemiological effects and socio-economic costs. In the absence of detailed knowledge of the interactions between individuals in a population and the characteristics of the SARS-Cov-2 virus, quantifying the effects of these policies is very difficult. Hence, there is an immediate need for models that can predict the spread of COVID-19 in a population, without the need for such detailed information.

The MethodIn this manuscript, a method is presented that can be used to predict the spread of COVID-19 in any country and under any containment policy imposed separately on different groups in the population. The method tunes the parameters of a known stratified model based on the available data on the spread of COVID-19. The model includes a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and is easy to simulate and easy to understand. As it is presented in this manuscript, the population is divided into age-groups. But given the availability of the data, there is no reason to limit the stratification into only age-groups and we can consider any relevant groups. To estimate the parameters of the model such that it reflects the characteristics of the spread of COVID-19 in a population, the method relies on an optimisation scheme. More specifically, the optimisation scheme estimates the contact rates between different age groups in the population. But a very important and useful feature of the model is that the estimated parameters for one population can be translated and used for any other population with a known age-structure, which in this day and age, includes almost any country or city in the world. Also, it is shown that the method is quite insensitive to the underlying assumptions in the optimisation scheme and also to deliberate or non-deliberate errors that might have occurred in collecting the data.

ResultsThe capabilities of the model are demonstrated using a case study under different containment policies, from an uncontained population to mitigation and suppression policies. Also, we can use the model to quantify the effects of strategies which include switching between different containment policies at pre-determined points in time. The model allows us to quantify the effects of each of these policies on the spread of the disease in a population, in particular, the instantaneous and total numbers of infectious individuals in a population which are important parameters for policy-makers. The simulation results, as explained in the following, provide some insight into various policies and some of the results are possibly counter-intuitive for many people. For example, the model predicts that closing down schools and universities without any other containment policy imposed on older age-groups has almost no impact on the number of patients that might need support-care in hospitals. The method provides an easy-to-use tool to use the information collected on the spread of COVID-19 in a country or region and then use that information in another population which might not have been as widely affected by the disease yet.","Bokharaie, V.

12092,"Forecasting hospitalizations due to COVID-19 in South Dakota, USA.","1Anticipating the number of hospital beds needed for patients with COVID-19 remains a challenge. Early efforts to predict hospital bed needs focused on deriving predictions from SIR models, largely at the level of countries, provinces, or states. In the United States, these models rely on data reported by state health agencies. However, predictive disease and hospitalization dynamics at the state level are complicated by geographic variation in disease parameters. In addition it is difficult to make forecasts early in a pandemic due to minimal data. However, Bayesian approaches that allow models to be specified with informed prior information from areas that have already completed a disease curve can serve as prior estimates for areas that are beginning their curve. Here, a Bayesian non-linear regression (Weibull function) was used to forecast cumulative and active COVID-19 hospitalizations for South Dakota, USA. As expected, early forecasts were dominated by prior information, which was derived from New York City. Importantly, hospitalization trends also differed within South Dakota due to early peaks in an urban area, followed by later peaks in other rural areas of the state. Combining these trends led to altered forecasts with relevant policy implications.","Wesner, J.

In the current study, we study the influence of the age-based vulnerability of the population with respect to COVID-19 conditions on the recovery of COVID-19 patients. We study 245 patients in Singapore recovered and discharged during January 23-April 01. We first study the descriptive statistics of the length of in-hospital stay (LOS) of the COVID-19 patients based on demographic variables, namely age, and gender. Then, we determine the distribution of LOS, using local and generalized linear regression models. We take the approach of periodization based on critical changes in the disease transmission model. Even though the overall recovery rate has reduced drastically after a sudden spike in daily confirmations, our analysis shows that there is a considerable shift in the COVID-19 confirmations to the population in the non-vulnerable age-groups. We show that the LOS of the non-vulnerable age group is considerably lower at 9 days, as opposed to 15 or 20 days in the existing literature.","Sreevalsan-Nair, J.; Rani Vangimalla, R.; Rajesh Ghogale, P.",2020-06-07,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.17.20069724,4,Jaya Sreevalsan-Nair,"International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore, Karnataka, India",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069724v4?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069724v4.full.pdf,cc_by,NA

13902,The Coronavirus Health and Impact Survey (CRISIS) reveals reproducible correlates of pandemic-related mood states across the Atlantic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic and its social and economic consequences have had adverse impacts on physical and mental health worldwide and exposed all segments of the population to protracted uncertainty and daily disruptions. The CoRonavIruS health and Impact Survey (CRISIS) was developed for use as an easy to implement and robust questionnaire covering key domains relevant to mental distress and resilience during the pandemic. In the current work, we demonstrate the feasibility, psychometric structure and construct validity of this survey. We then show that pre-existing mood states, perceived COVID risk, and lifestyle changes are strongly associated with negative mood states during the pandemic in population samples of adults and in parents reporting on their children in the US and UK.

20261,Risk factors for bacterial infections in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19: A case control study,"ObjectiveBacterial infections are known to complicate respiratory viral infections and are associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. A case control study was conducted to determine risk factors for bacterial infections where cases were defined as moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 patients with bacterial infection and those without were included as controls. Logistic regression analysis was performed.

ResultsOut of a total of 50 cases and 50 controls, greater proportion of cases had severe or critical disease at presentation as compared to control i.e 80% vs 30% (p<0.001). Hospital acquired pneumonia (72%) and Gram negative organisms (82%) were predominant. Overall antibiotic utilization was 82% and was 64% in patients who had no evidence of bacterial infection. The median length of stay was significantly longer among cases compared to controls (12.5 versus 7.5 days) (p=0.001). The overall mortality was 30%, with comparatively higher proportion of deaths among cases (42% versus 18%) (p=0.009). Severe or critical COVID-19 at presentation (AOR: 4.42 times; 95% CI; 1.63-11.9) and use of steroids (AOR: 4.60; 95% CI 1.24-17.05) were independently associated with risk of bacterial infections. These findings have implications for antibiotic stewardship as antibiotics can be reserved for those at higher risk for bacterial superinfections.","Nasir, N.; Rehman, F. U.; Omair, S.

2575,Impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China,"This paper examines the role of various socioeconomic factors in mediating the local and cross-city transmissions of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) in China. We implement a machine learning approach to select instrumental variables that strongly predict virus transmission among the rich exogenous weather characteristics. Our 2SLS estimates show that the stringent quarantine, massive lockdown and other public health measures imposed in late January significantly reduced the transmission rate of COVID-19. By early February, the virus spread had been contained. While many socioeconomic factors mediate the virus spread, a robust government response since late January played a determinant role in the containment of the virus. We also demonstrate that the actual population flow from the outbreak source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. The results have rich implications for ongoing global efforts in containment of COVID-19.","Qiu, Y.; Chen, X.; Shi, W.",2020-03-17,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.13.20035238,1,Wei Shi,Jinan University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035238v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035238v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1007/s00148-020-00778-2

17581,Increasing both specificity and sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests by using an adaptive orthogonal testing approach,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 antibody tests have undergone a remarkable improvement in performance. However, due to the low seroprevalence in several areas, very high demands are made on their specificity. Furthermore, the low antibody-response in some individuals requires high test sensitivity to avoid underestimating true seroprevalence. Optimization of testing has been reported through lowering manufacturer cut-offs to improve SARS-CoV-2 assay sensitivity or by combining two tests to improve specificity at the cost of sensitivity. However, these strategies have thus far been used in isolation of each other.

MethodsTo increase sensitivity, cut-offs of three commercially available SARS-CoV-2 automated assays (Roche, Abbott, and DiaSorin) were reduced according to published values in a pre-pandemic specificity cohort (n=1117) and a SARS-CoV-2 positive cohort (n=64). All three testing systems were combined in an orthogonal approach with a confirmatory test, which was one of the remaining automated assays or one of two commercial ELISAs directed against the spike protein receptor binding-domain (RBD) or the nucleocapsid antigen (NP).

ResultsThe modified orthogonal test strategy resulted in an improved specificity of at least 99.8%, often even 100%, in all 12 tested combinations with no significant decline in sensitivity. In our cohort, regardless of whether the assays were used for screening or confirmation, combining Roche and Abbott delivered the best overall performance (+[~]10% sensitivity compared to the single tests and 100% specificity).

ConclusionHere we propose a novel orthogonal assay strategy that approaches 100% specificity while maintaining or even significantly improving the screening tests sensitivity.","Perkmann, T.; Perkmann-Nagele, N.; Ozsvar-Kozma, M.; Koller, T.; Breyer, M.-K.; Breyer-Kohansal, R.; Burghuber, O.

12633,Therapeutic effectiveness of interferon alpha 2b treatment for COVID-19 patient recovery,"BackgroundEffective antiviral treatments are required to contain the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A previous report in 814 patients COVID-19 positive in Cuba provided preliminary therapeutic efficacy evidence with interferon-2b (IFN-2b) from March 11 to April 14, 2020. This study, re-evaluates the contribution of IFN-2b on the evolution of all patients, after 98 days of the epidemic, in a period from March 11 to June 17, 2020.

MethodA prospective observational study was implemented to monitor a therapeutic intervention with IFN-2b used in the national protocol for COVID-19 attending in Cuba. Were included patients with positive throat swab specimens by real time RT-PCR who gave informed consent and had no contraindications for IFN treatment. Patients received therapy as per the Cuban COVID protocol that included a combination of oral antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine) with intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of IFN-2b The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients discharged from hospital, secondary was the case fatality rate and several outcomes related to time variables were also evaluated.

ResultsFrom March 11th until June 17th, 2295 patients had been confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive in Cuba, 2165 were treated with Heberon(R) Alpha R and 130 received the approved protocol without IFN. The proportion of fully recovered patients was higher in the IFN-treated compared with non-IFN treated group. Prior IFN treatment decreases the likelihood of intensive care and increases the survival after severe or critical diseases. The benefits of IFN were significantly supported by time variables analyzed.

ConclusionsThis second report confirm the preliminary evidences from first for the therapeutic effectiveness of IFN-2b for SARS-Cov-2 infection and postulated that Heberon(R) Alpha R is the main component within the antiviral triad used as a therapeutic intervention in the Cuban protocol COVID-19.","Pereda, R.; Gonzalez, D.; Rivero, H.

We quantify SARS-CoV-2 virus survivability within water and the risk of infection posed by faecal contaminated water within 39 countries. We identify that the virus can remain stable within water for up to 25 days, and country specific relative risk of infection posed by faecal contaminated water is related to the environment. Faecal contaminated rivers, waterways and water systems within countries with high infection rates can provide infectious doses >100 copies within 100 ml of water. The implications for freshwater systems, the coastal marine environment and virus resurgence are discussed.","Shutler, J.; Zaraska, K.; Holding, T.

15934,"Markers Of Coagulation And Hemostatic Activation Identify COVID-19 Patients At High Risk For Thrombotic Events, ICU Admission and Intubation","BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with a coagulopathy giving rise to venous and arterial thrombotic events. The objective of our study was to determine whether markers of coagulation and hemostatic activation (MOCHA) on admission could identify COVID-19 patients at risk for thrombotic events and other complications.

MethodsCOVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary academic healthcare system from April 3, 2020 to July 31, 2020 underwent standardized admission testing of MOCHA profile parameters (plasma d-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1.2, thrombin-antithrombin complex, and fibrin monomer) with abnormal MOCHA defined as [&ge;] 2 markers above the reference. Prespecified thrombotic endpoints included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and access line thrombosis; other complications included ICU admission, intubation and mortality. We excluded patients on anticoagulation therapy prior to admission and those who were pregnant.

ResultsOf 276 patients (mean age 59 {+/-} 6.4 years, 47% female, 62% African American race) who met study criteria, 45 (16%) had a thrombotic event. Each coagulation marker on admission was independently associated with a vascular endpoint (p<0.05). Admission MOCHA with [&ge;] 2 abnormalities (n=203, 74%) was associated with in-hospital vascular endpoints (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2-8.8), as were admission D-dimer [&ge;] 2000 ng/mL (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5-6.6), and admission D-dimer [&ge;] 3000 ng/mL (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-7.9). However, only admission MOCHA with [&ge;] 2 abnormalities was associated with ICU admission (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.7-5.2) and intubation (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.6-6.4), while admission D-dimer [&ge;]2000 ng/mL and admission D-dimer [&ge;] 3000 ng/mL were not associated. MOCHA and D-dimer cutoffs were not associated with mortality. Admission MOCHA with <2 abnormalities (26% of the cohort) had a sensitivity of 88% and negative predictive value of 93% for a vascular endpoint.

ConclusionsAdmission MOCHA with [&ge;] 2 abnormalities identified COVID-19 patients at increased risk of ICU admission and intubation during hospitalization more effectively than isolated admission D-dimer measurement. Admission MOCHA with <2 abnormalities identified a subgroup of patients at low risk for vascular events. Our results suggest that an admission MOCHA profile can be useful to risk-stratify COVID-19 patients.","Alabyad, D.; Rangaraju, S.; Liu, M.; Imran, R.; Kempton, C.; Sharifpour, M.; Auld, S.; Gaddh, M.; Sniecinski, R.; Maier, C.

14716,Safety and Efficacy of Antiviral Drugs for the Treatment of Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-analyses,"ObjectiveTo systematically review the safety and efficacy outcomes of using antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19.

MethodsFive databases were screened from inception to 27-Aug-2020. The effects of specific drug interventions on safety and efficacy were assessed in COVID-19 patients. Risk Ratios (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models.

ResultsA total of 10 studies were identified which fulfill the inclusion criteria. Patients taking antivirals had 26% less risk of having a severe adverse event (SAE) compared to controls (RR, 0.74, CI:0.62 to 0.89, P=0.002). Clinical improvement at day 14 was observed among the cases treated with antivirals compared to the control group (RR 1.24, CI: 1.00 to 1.53 p=0.05).

ConclusionThere is evidence that Remdesivir and LPV/r reduces the hospital length of stay and that patients to which antivirals were administered had less SAE and improvement when compared to patients not prescribed with antivirals. Due to a lack of power and the quality of the studies, it was not possible to determine which antivirals have a greater risk-benefit balance, and therefore the optimal approach to antiviral treatment is still uncertain.","Aponte Torres, Z.; Lopez-Leon, S.; Muthuvel, T.; Manivannan, S.; Srivastava, K.; Pavesi, M.",2020-09-10,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.09.03.20187526,1,Zuleika Aponte Torres,Aponte Epidemiology Consultancy,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.20187526v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.20187526v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

14029,"A multipurpose machine learning approach to predict COVID-19 negative prognosis in Sao Paulo, Brazil","IntroductionThe new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a challenge for clinical decision-making and the effective allocation of healthcare resources. An accurate prognostic assessment is necessary to improve survival of patients, especially in developing countries. This study proposes to predict the risk of developing critical conditions in COVID-19 patients by training multipurpose algorithms.

MethodsA total of 1,040 patients with a positive RT-PCR diagnosis for COVID-19 from a large hospital from Sao Paulo, Brazil, were followed from March to June 2020, of which 288 (28%) presented a severe prognosis, i.e. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, use of mechanical ventilation or death. Routinely-collected laboratory, clinical and demographic data was used to train five machine learning algorithms (artificial neural networks, extra trees, random forests, catboost, and extreme gradient boosting). A random sample of 70% of patients was used to train the algorithms and 30% were left for performance assessment, simulating new unseen data. In order to assess if the algorithms could capture general severe prognostic patterns, each model was trained by combining two out of three outcomes to predict the other.

ResultsAll algorithms presented very high predictive performance (average AUROC of 0.92, sensitivity of 0.92, and specificity of 0.82). The three most important variables for the multipurpose algorithms were ratio of lymphocyte per C-reactive protein, C-reactive protein and Braden Scale.

ConclusionThe results highlight the possibility that machine learning algorithms are able to predict unspecific negative COVID-19 outcomes from routinely-collected data.","Fernandes, F.

13624,"Genetically-predicted vitamin D status, ambient UVB during the pandemic and COVID-19 risk in UK Biobank: Mendelian Randomisation study","A growing body of evidence shows that poor vitamin D status has been associated with an increased susceptibility to viral and bacterial respiratory infections. In this study, we aimed to examine the association between vitamin D and COVID-19 risk and outcomes, and to explore potential causal effects. We used logistic regression to identify associations between different vitamin D variables (25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (25-OHD), ambient UVB and genetically-predicted 25-OHD concentrations) and COVID-19 (risk of infection, hospitalisation and death) in 495,780 participants from UK Biobank. We subsequently performed a Mendelian Randomisation (MR) study to test if there was any causal effect. In total, 1,746 COVID-19 cases and 399 COVID-19 deaths occurred between March and June 2020. We found significant inverse associations between COVID-19 infection and 25-OHD in univariable models, but these associations were non-significant after adjustment for confounders. Ambient UVB was strongly and inversely associated with hospitalization and death. Although the main MR analysis showed that genetically-predicted vitamin D levels were not causally associated with COVID-19 risk, MR sensitivity analysis using weighted mode method indicated a potential causal effect (OR=0.72, 95% CI:0.53-0.98; P=0.041). In conclusion, our study found suggestive evidence of association between vitamin D and the risk or severity of COVID-19 but further studies are needed.","Li, X.; Geffen, J. V.; Weele, M.

4577,Failing our Most Vulnerable: COVID-19 and Long-Term Care Facilities in Ontario,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 epidemic has taken a fearsome toll on individuals residing in long-term care facilities (LTC). As of April 10, 2020 half of Canadas COVID-19 deaths had occurred in LTC. We sought to better understand trends and risk factors for COVID-19 death in LTC in Ontario.

MethodsWe analyzed a COVID-19 outbreak database created by the Ontario Ministry of Health, for the period March 29-April 7, 2020. Mortality incidence rate ratios for LTC were calculated with community living Ontarians aged > 69 used as the comparator group. Count-based regression methods were used to model temporal trends and identify associations between infection risk in staff and residents, and subsequent LTC resident death.

ResultsConfirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 were identified in 272/627 LTC by April 7, 2020. The incidence rate ratio for COVID-19 death was 13.1 (9.9-17.3) relative to community living adults over 69. Incidence rate ratio increased over time and was 87.28 (90% CrI 9.98 to 557.08) by April 7, 2020. Lagged infection in staff was a strong predictor of death in residents (e.g., adjusted IRR for death per infected staff member 1.17, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.26 at a 6-day lag).

InterpretationMortality risk in elders in Ontario is currently concentrated in LTC, and this risk has increased sharply over a short period of time. Early identification of risk requires a focus on testing and provision of personal protective equipment to staff, and restructuring the LTC workforce to prevent movement of COVID-19 between LTC.

16987,Community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in England during April to September 2020: Results from the ONS Coronavirus Infection Survey,"BackgroundDecisions regarding the continued need for control measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 rely on accurate and up-to-date information about the number of people and risk factors for testing positive. Existing surveillance systems are not based on population samples and are generally not longitudinal in design.

MethodsFrom 26 April to 19 September2020, 514,794 samples from 123,497 individuals were collected from individuals aged 2 years and over from a representative sample of private households from England. Participants completed a questionnaire and nose and throat swab were taken. The percentage of individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was estimated over time using dynamic multilevel regression and post-stratification, to account for potential residual non-representativeness. Potential changes in risk factors for testing positive over time were also evaluated using multilevel regression models.

FindingsBetween 26 April and 19 September 2020, in total, results were available from 514,794 samples from 123,497 individuals, of which 489 were positive overall from 398 individuals. The percentage of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 changed substantially over time, with an initial decrease between end of April and June, followed by low levels during the summer, before marked increases end of August and September 2020. Having a patient-facing role and working outside your home were important risk factors for testing positive in the first period but not (yet) in the second period of increased positivity rates, and age (young adults) being an important driver of the second period of increased positivity rates. A substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms (53%-70%, dependent on calendar time).

InterpretationImportant risk factors for testing positive varied substantially between the initial and second periods of higher positivity rates, and a substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be important for managing the epidemic moving forwards.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSUnprecedented control measures, such as national lockdowns, have been widely implemented to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Decisions regarding the continued need for social distancing measures in the overall population, specific subgroups and geographic areas heavily rely on accurate and up-to-date information about the number of people and risk factors for testing positive. We searched PubMed and medRxiv and bioRxiv preprint servers up to 6 June 2020 for epidemiological studies using the terms ""SARS-CoV-2"" and ""prevalence"" or ""incidence"" without data or language restrictions. Most studies were small or had only information about current presence of the virus for a small subset of patients, or used data not representative of the community, such as hospital admissions, deaths or self-reported symptoms. Large population-based studies, such as the current study, are required to understand risk factors and the dynamics of the epidemic.

Added value of this studyThis is the first longitudinal community survey of SARS-CoV-2 infection at national and regional levels in the UK. With more than 500,000 swabs from more than 120,000 individuals this study provides robust evidence that the percentage of individuals from the general community in England testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 clearly declined between end of April and June 2020,, followed by consistently low levels during the summer, before marked increases end of August and September 2020. Risk factors for testing positive varied substantially between the initial and second periods of higher positivity rates, with having a patient-facing role and working outside your home being important risk factors in the first period but not (yet) in the second period, and age (young adults) being an important driver of the second period of increased positivity rates. Positive tests commonly occurred without symptoms being reported.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe observed decline in the percentage of individuals testing positive adds to the increasing body of empirical evidence and theoretical models that suggest that the lockdown imposed on 23 March 2020 in England was associated, at least temporarily, with a decrease in infections. Important risk factors for testing positive varied substantially between the initial and second periods of higher positivity rates, and a substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be important for managing the epidemic moving forwards.","Pouwels, K.

10636,Reliability of serological tests for COVID-19: Comparison of three immunochromatography test kits for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.,"BackgroundSeveral immunochromatographic serological test kits have been developed to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibodies, but their relative performance and potential clinical utility is unclear.

MethodsThree commercially available serological test kits were evaluated using 99 serum samples collected from 29 patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

ResultsThe IgM antibody-positive rates of the three serological test kits for samples taken at the early stage of the disease (0-6 days after onset) were 19.0%, 23.8%, and 19.0%, respectively. The IgM antibody-positive rates over the entire period were 21.2%, 60.6%, and 15.2%, respectively. The IgG antibody-positive rates for samples taken after 13 days of onset were 100.0%, 97.6%, and 97.6%, respectively.

ConclusionThere were large differences among the results of the three test kits. Only few cases showed positive results for IgM in the early stage of disease and the IgM antibody-positive rates over the entire period were low, suggesting that the kits used in this study were unsuitable for diagnosis of COVID-19. The IgG antibody was positive in almost all samples after 13 days of onset, suggesting that it may be useful for determining infections in the recent past.","Fujigaki, H.; Takemura, M.; Osawa, M.; Sakurai, A.; Nakamoto, K.; Seto, K.; Fujita, T.; Hata, T.; Akiyama, H.; Doi, Y.; Saito, K.",2020-06-29,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.28.20140475,1,Hidetsugu Fujigaki,Fujita Health University Graduate School of Health Sciences,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.28.20140475v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.28.20140475v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04929
3709,Corona Epidemic in Indian context: Predictive Mathematical Modelling,"The novel Coronavirus pathogen Covid-19 is a cause of concern across the world as the human-to-human infection caused by it is spreading at a fast pace. The virus that first manifested in Wuhan, China has travelled across continents. The increase in number of deaths in Italy, Iran, USA, and other countries has alarmed both the developed and developing countries. Scientists are working hard to develop a vaccine against the virus, but until now no breakthrough has been achieved. India, the second most populated country in the world, is working hard in all dimensions to stop the spread of community infection. Health care facilities are being updated; medical and paramedical staffs are getting trained, and many agencies are raising awareness on the issues related to this virus and its transmission. The administration is leaving no stone unturned to prepare the country to mitigate the adverse effects. However, as the number of infected patients, and those getting cured is changing differently in different states everyday it is difficult to predict the spread of the virus and its fate in Indian context. Different states have adopted measures to stop the community spread. Considering the vast size of the country, the population size and other socio-economic conditions of the states, a single uniform policy may not work to contain the disease. In this paper, we discuss a predictive mathematical model that can give us some idea of the fate of the virus, an indicative data and future projections to understand the further course this pandemic can take. The data can be used by the health care agencies, the Government Organizations and the Planning Commission to make suitable arrangements to fight the pandemic. Though the model is preliminary, it can be used at regional level to manage the health care system in the present scenario. The recommendations can be made, and advisories prepared based on the predictive results that can be implemented at regional levels.","Bhola, J.; Revathi Venkateswaran, V.; Koul, M.",2020-04-07,Health Policy,10.1101/2020.04.03.20047175,1,Monika Koul,"Hansraj College, University of Delhi",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20047175v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20047175v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
8816,Dynamics and Development of the COVID-19 Epidemics in the US: a Compartmental Model with Deep Learning Enhancement,"BackgroundCompartmental models dominate epidemic modeling. Estimations of transmission parameters between compartments are typically done through stochastic parameterization processes that depend upon detailed statistics on transmission characteristics, which are economically and resource-wide expensive to collect. We apply deep learning techniques as a lower data dependency alternative to estimate transmission parameters of a customized compartmental model, for the purposes of simulating the dynamics of the US COVID-19 epidemics and projecting its further development.

MethodsWe construct a compartmental model. We develop a multistep deep learning methodology to estimate the models transmission parameters. We then feed the estimated transmission parameters to the model to predict the development of the US COVID-19 epidemics for 35 and 42 days. Epidemics are considered suppressed when the basic reproduction number (R0) becomes less than one.

ResultsThe deep learning-enhanced compartmental model predicts that R0 will become less than one around June 19 to July 3, 2020, at which point the epidemics will effectively start to die out, and that the US ""Infected"" population will peak round June 18 to July 2, 2020 between 1{middle dot}34 million and 1{middle dot}41 million individual cases. The models also predict that the number of accumulative confirmed cases will cross the 2 million mark around June 10 to 11, 2020.

ConclusionsCurrent compartmental models require stochastic parameterization to estimate the transmission parameters. These models effectiveness depends upon detailed statistics on transmission characteristics. As an alternative, deep learning techniques are effective in estimating these stochastic parameters with greatly reduced dependency on data particularity.","Deng, Q.",2020-06-06,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.31.20118414,2,Qi Deng,Zhejiang Normal University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.31.20118414v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.31.20118414v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.2196/21173
14082,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on wellbeing and cognitive functioning of older adults,"COVID-19 took a heavy toll on older adults. In Belgium, by the end of August, 93% of deaths due to COVID-19 were aged 65 or older. Similar trends were observed in other countries. As a consequence, older adults were identified as a group at risk, and strict governmental restrictions were imposed on them. This has caused concerns about their mental health. Using an online survey, this study established the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults aged 65 years or older, and which factors moderate this impact. Participants reported a significant decrease in activity level, sleep quality and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression was strongly related to reported declines in activity level, sleep quality, wellbeing and cognitive functioning. Our study shows that the COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on the mental health of older adults. This implies that this group at risk requires attention of governments and healthcare.","De Pue, S.; Gillebert, C.; Dierckx, E.; Vanderhasselt, M.-A.; De Raedt, R.; Van Den Bussche, E.",2020-09-01,Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology,10.1101/2020.08.27.20183129,1,Sarah De Pue,KU Leuven,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.27.20183129v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.27.20183129v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
16901,The French Covid-19 contact tracing app: usage and opinions by students in the health domain,"BackgroundMany countries around the world have developed mobile phone apps capable of supporting instantaneous contact tracing to control the Covid-19 pandemic. In France, a few people have downloaded and are using the StopCovid contact tracing app. Reasons for this low uptake are unexplored. Students in the health domain are especially concerned and their usage and opinions about the app can inform improvements and diffusion of StopCovid among young people.

ObjectiveTo investigate health-related students knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices about the StopCovid app.

MethodsA field survey was conducted among 318 students at the health sciences campus of the University of Bordeaux, France, between September 25th and October 16th, 2020. Quota sampling method was used and descriptive statistics were performed.

ResultsA total of 77.3% (246/318) students had heard about the app, but only 11.3% (36/318) had downloaded it and 4.7% (15/318) were still using it at the time of the survey. Main reasons for not using the app were: belief that it was not effective given its limited diffusion (17.6%, 37/210), lack of interest (17.6%, 37/210) and distrust in data security and fear to be geo-located (15.7%, 33/210). Among those who had not heard about the app, after a brief description of its functioning and confidentiality policy, 52.7% (38/72) would use it. Participants reported that the main solution for increasing the use of the app would be a better communication (71.4%, 227/318).

ConclusionEven among health students, the contact tracing app was poorly used. Findings suggest that improved communication describing its advantages and simplicity of use, and clarifying false beliefs about the app could help improving significantly its uptake.","Montagni, I.; Roussel, N.; Thiebaut, R.; Tzourio, C.",2020-11-12,Medical Education,10.1101/2020.10.23.20218214,2,Ilaria Montagni,University of Bordeaux,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.23.20218214v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.23.20218214v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
11032,WICID framework Version 1.0: Criteria and considerations to guide evidence-informed decision-making on non-pharmacological interventions targeting COVID-19,"1IntroductionDecision-making on matters of public health and health policy requires the balancing of numerous, often conflicting factors. However, a broad societal discourse and a participatory decision-making process on the criteria underpinning the decision was often not feasible within the time constraints imposed on by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While evidence-to-decision frameworks are not able or intended to replace stakeholder participation, they can serve as a tool to approach relevancy and comprehensiveness of the criteria considered.

ObjectiveTo develop a decision-making framework adapted to the challenges of decision-making on national and sub-national level implementation of non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) measures to contain the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

MethodsWe employed the ""best-fit"" framework synthesis technique and used the WHO-INTEGRATE framework Version 1.0 as a starting point. In a first phase adapted the framework through brainstorming exercises and application to exemplary case studies (e.g. school reopening). In a second phase we conducted a content analysis of comprehensive strategy documents intended to guide policymakers on the phasing out of applied lockdown measures in Germany. Based on factors and criteria identified in this process, we adapted previous framework versions into the WICID (WHO-INTEGRATE COVID-19) framework Version 1.0.

ResultsTwelve comprehensive strategy documents were included in the content analysis. The revised WICID framework consists of eleven criteria, supported by 48 aspects, the metacriterion quality of evidence and embraces a complexity and systems-perspective. The criteria cover implications for the health of individuals and populations due to and beyond COVID-19, infringement on liberties and fundamental human rights, acceptability and equity considerations, societal, environmental, and economic implications, as well as resource and feasibility considerations.

DiscussionIn a third phase, the proposed framework will be expanded through a comprehensive document analysis focusing on key-stakeholder groups across the society. The WICID framework can be a tool to support comprehensive evidence-informed decision-making processes.

2 Key-questionsO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABSAd-hoc Decision-making on matters of public health and health policy such as non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, requires decision-makers to balance numerous and often conflicting criteria. Insufficient consideration of relevant factors reduces acceptance and can limit the effectiveness of the intervention.

What are the new findings?Based on a content-analysis of comprehensive strategy documents, we newly developed WICID framework provides of 11+1 criteria informed by 47 aspects which are intended to support decision-makers in the balancing act of identifying and considering criteria of relevance.

What do the new findings imply?The usage of the WICID evidence-to-decision framework can support decision-makers and expert committees in making more balanced decision, even if not all voices of relevant stakeholders could be included in the process due to time constraints imposed by the rapid progress of the pandemic.","Stratil, J.

2205,Relations of parameters for describing the epidemic of COVID-19 by the Kermack-McKendrick model,"In order to quantitatively characterize the epidemic of COVID-19, useful relations among parameters describing an epidemic in general are derived based on the Kermack-McKendrick model. The first relation is 1/{tau}grow =1/{tau}trans-1/{tau}inf, where{tau} grow is the time constant of the exponential growth of an epidemic,{tau} trans is the time for a pathogen to be transmitted from one patient to uninfected person, and the infectious time{tau} inf is the time during which the pathogen keeps its power of transmission. The second relation p({infty}) {approx} 1-exp(-(R0-1)/0.60) is the relation between p({infty}), the final size of the disaster defined by the ratio of the total infected people to the population of the society, and the basic reproduction number, R0, which is the number of persons infected by the transmission of the pathogen from one infected person during the infectious time. The third relation 1/{tau}end = 1/{tau}inf-(1-p({infty}))/{tau}trans gives the decay time constant{tau} end at the ending stage of the epidemic. Derived relations are applied to influenza in Japan in 2019 for characterizing the epidemic.","Tomie, T.",2020-03-03,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.02.26.20027797,1,Toshihisa Tomie,Changchun University of Science and Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20027797v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20027797v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
15470,"Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection with LamPORE, a high-throughput platform combining loop-mediated isothermal amplification and nanopore sequencing","LamPORE is a novel diagnostic platform for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA that combines loop-mediated isothermal amplification with nanopore sequencing, which could potentially be used to analyse thousands of samples per day on a single instrument. We evaluated the performance of LamPORE against RT-PCR using RNA extracted from spiked respiratory samples and from stored nose and throat swabs collected at two UK hospitals. The limit of detection of LamPORE was 7-10 genome copies/microlitre of extracted RNA. This is above the limit achievable by RT-PCR but was not associated with a significant reduction of sensitivity in clinical samples. Positive clinical specimens came mostly from patients with acute symptomatic infection, and among these LamPORE had a diagnostic sensitivity of 99.1% (226/228 [95% CI 96.9-99.9%]). Among negative clinical specimens, including 153 with other respiratory pathogens detected, LamPORE had a diagnostic specificity of 99.6% (278/279 [98.0-100.0%]). Overall, 1.4% (7/514 [0.5-2.9]) of samples produced an indeterminate result on first testing, and repeat LamPORE testing on the same RNA extract had a reproducibility of 96.8% (478/494 [94.8-98.1]). This indicates that LamPORE has a similar performance to RT-PCR for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic patients, and offers a promising approach to high-throughput testing.","Peto, L.; Rodger, G.; Carter, D.

One of the primary benefits of face masks and other coverings is as source control devices to reduce the expulsion of respiratory aerosols during coughing, breathing, and speaking. Face shields and neck gaiters have been proposed as an alternative to face masks, but information about face shields and neck gaiters as source control devices is limited. We used a cough aerosol simulator with a pliable skin headform to propel small aerosol particles (0 to 7 {micro}m) into different face coverings. An N95 respirator blocked 99% of the cough aerosol, a medical grade procedure mask blocked 59%, a 3-ply cotton cloth face mask blocked 51%, and a polyester neck gaiter blocked 47% as a single layer and 60% when folded into a double layer. In contrast, the face shield blocked 2% of the cough aerosol. Our results suggest that face masks and neck gaiters are preferable to face shields as source control devices for cough aerosols.","Lindsley, W. G.; Blachere, F. M.; Law, B. F.; Beezhold, D.

10699,Modeling the early phase of the Belgian COVID-19 epidemic using a stochastic compartmental model and studying its implied future trajectories,"Following the onset of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic throughout the world, a large fraction of the global population is or has been under strict measures of physical distancing and quarantine, with many countries being in partial or full lockdown. These measures are imposed in order to reduce the spread of the disease and to lift the pressure on healthcare systems. Estimating the impact of such interventions as well as monitoring the gradual relaxing of these stringent measures is quintessential to understand how resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic can be controlled for in the future. In this paper we use a stochastic age-structured discrete time compartmental model to describe the transmission of COVID-19 in Belgium. Our model explicitly accounts for age-structure by integrating data on social contacts to (i) assess the impact of the lockdown as implemented on March 13, 2020 on the number of new hospitalizations in Belgium; (ii) conduct a scenario analysis estimating the impact of possible exit strategies on potential future COVID-19 waves. More specifically, the aforementioned model is fitted to hospital admission data, data on the daily number of COVID-19 deaths and serial serological survey data informing the (sero)prevalence of the disease in the population while relying on a Bayesian MCMC approach. Our age-structured stochastic model describes the observed outbreak data well, both in terms of hospitalizations as well as COVID-19 related deaths in the Belgian population. Despite an extensive exploration of various projections for the future course of the epidemic, based on the impact of adherence to measures of physical distancing and a potential increase in contacts as a result of the relaxation of the stringent lockdown measures, a lot of uncertainty remains about the evolution of the epidemic in the next months.","Abrams, S.; Wambua, J.; Santermans, E.; Willem, L.; Kuylen, E.; Coletti, P.; Libin, P.; Faes, C.; Petrof, O.; Herzog, S.

19773,HLA-C* 04:01 is a Genetic Risk Allele for Severe Course of COVID-19,"BackgroundSince the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been increasing demand to identify predictors of severe clinical course in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Human leukocyte antigen alleles (HLA) have been suggested as potential genetic host factors. We sought to evaluate this hypothesis by conducting an international multicenter study using HLA sequencing with subsequent independent validation.

MethodsWe analyzed a total of 332 samples. First, we enrolled 233 patients in Germany, Spain, and Switzerland for HLA and whole exome sequencing. Furthermore, we validated our results in a public data set (United States, n=99). Patients older than 18 years presenting with COVID-19 were included, representing the full spectrum of the disease. HLA candidate alleles were identified in the derivation cohort (n=92) and tested in two independent validation cohorts (n=240).

ResultsWe identified HLA-C* 04:01 as a novel genetic predictor for severe clinical course in COVID-19. Carriers of HLA-C* 04:01 had twice the risk of intubation when infected with SARS-CoV-2 (hazard ratio 2.1, adjusted p-value=0.0036). Importantly, these findings were successfully replicated in an independent data set. Furthermore, our findings are biologically plausible, as HLA-C* 04:01 has fewer predicted bindings sites with relevant SARS-CoV-2 peptides as compared to other HLA alleles. Exome sequencing confirmed findings from HLA analysis.

ConclusionsHLA-C* 04:01 carriage is associated with a twofold increased risk of intubation in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Testing for HLA-C* 04:01 could have clinical implications to identify high-risk patients and individualize management.","Weiner, J.; Suwalski, P.; Holtgrewe, M.; Thibeault, C.; Mueller, M.; Patriki, D.; Quedenau, C.; Krueger, U.; Helbig, E.

7678,"The COVID-19 Pandemic Predominantly Hits Poor Neighborhoods, or does it? Evidence from Germany","BackgroundReports from the UK and the USA suggest that COVID-19 predominantly affects poorer individuals and neighbourhoods. This article paints a more complex picture by distinguishing between a first and second phase of the pandemic. The initial spread of infections and its correlation with socioeconomic factors largely depends on how the virus first entered a country. The second phase of the pandemic begins when individuals start taking precautionary measures and governments implement lockdowns. In this phase the further spread of the virus depends on the ability of individuals to socially distance themselves, which is to some extent socially stratified.

MethodsWe analyze the geographical distribution of known cases per capita across 401 local districts in Germany, once for infections in the initial phase and for new infections during the second phase.

ResultsIn Germany, the virus first entered via individuals returning from skiing in the Alps and other international travel. In this first phase we find a positive association between the wealth of a district and infection rates and a negative association with indicators of social deprivation. During the second phase, richer districts and districts with a higher share of university-educated employees record fewer new infections, whilst the initial safety advantage of more socially deprived districts disappears.

ConclusionThe social stratification of Covid-19 changes substantively across the two phases of the pandemic in Germany. Only in the second phase does socio-economic advantage turn into a safety advantage. Thus, suggestions that the pandemic predominantly hits the poor needs to be qualified.","Pluemper, T.; Neumayer, E.",2020-05-22,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.05.18.20105395,1,Thomas Pluemper,Vienna University of Economics and Business,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.18.20105395v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.18.20105395v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
14447,Predicting the cumulative medical load of COVID-19 outbreaks after the peak in daily fatalities,"The distinct ways the COVID-19 pandemics has been unfolding in different countries and regions suggest that local societal and governmental structures play an important role not only for the the baseline infection rate, but also for the short-term and long-term reaction to the outbreak. We propose to investigate the question of how societies as a whole, and governments in particular, modulate the dynamics of a novel epidemic using a generalization of the SIR model, the controlled SIR model. We posit that containment measures are equivalent to a feedback between the status of the outbreak and the reproduction factor. Short-term control of an outbreak, corresponds in this framework to the reaction of governments and individuals to daily cases and fatalities. The reaction to the cumulative number of cases or deaths, and not to daily numbers, is captured in contrast by long-term control. We present the exact phase space solution of the controlled SIR model and use it to quantify containment policies for a large number of countries in terms of short- and long-term control parameters. We find increased contributions of long-term control for countries and regions in which the outbreak was suppressed substantially together with a strong correlation between the strength of societal and governmental policies and the time needed to contain COVID-19 outbreaks. Furthermore, for numerous countries and regions we identified a predictive relation between the number of fatalities within a fixed period before and after the peak daily fatality count which predicts the cumulative medical load of COVID-19 outbreaks that should be expected after the peak. These results suggest applicability of the proposed model not only for understanding the outbreak dynamics, but also for predicting future cases and fatalities once the effectiveness of outbreak suppression policies is established with sufficient certainty.

Author summaryThe country specific dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemics has been suggests that local societal response and governmental structures are critical both for the baseline infection rate and the short-term and long-term reaction to the outbreak. Here we investigate how societies as a whole, and governments, in particular, modulate the dynamics of a novel epidemic using the controlled SIR model, a generalisation of a standard compartmental model used for modelling the dynamics of infectious diseases. We posit that containment measures correspond to feedback between the status of the outbreak (the daily or the cumulative number of cases and fatalities) and the reproduction factor.

We present the exact phase space solution of the controlled SIR model and use it to quantify containment policies for a large number of countries in terms of model parameters corresponding to long- and short-term control. Furthermore, we identified for numerous countries a relationship between the number of fatalities within a fixed period before and after the peak in daily fatalities. As the number of fatalities corresponds to the number of hospitalised patients, the relationship can be used to predict the cumulative medical load, once the effectiveness of outbreak suppression policies is established with sufficient certainty.","Gros, C.; Valenti, R.; Schneider, L.; Gutsche, B.; Markovic, D.",2020-09-05,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.03.20183384,1,Claudius Gros,"Institute for Theoretical Physics, Goethe University Frankfurt am Main",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.20183384v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.20183384v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
17132,Rapid Support for older adults during the initial stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results from a Geriatric Psychiatry helpline,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic and governmental lockdown measures disproportionally impacts older adults. This study presents the results from a psychiatric helpline for older adults in Mannheim, Germany, during the lockdown, set up to provide information and psychosocial support measures. We aim to elucidate the needs of older adults, their reported changes and the psychological impact during the initial stages of the health crisis.

Methods55 older adults called the psychiatric helpline between April and June 2020. Information on demographics, previous diagnosis of psychiatric and somatic diseases as well as changes in daily life due to the pandemic was collected anonymously. Current mental health status was assessed using the depression HAMD-7 and the anxiety HAM-A scales.

ResultsMost callers were women, older adults (M = 74.69 years), single and retired. 69% of callers reported new or an increase in psychiatric symptoms, with anxiety and depressive symptoms being the most common ones. Age was significantly negatively correlated to higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. Individuals with a previous diagnosis of a psychiatric disease reported significantly higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than those without a diagnosis.

ConclusionIn older adults, the perceived psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis appears to ameliorate with age. Individuals with a history of psychiatric disease are most vulnerable to negative mental health outcomes. Rapid response in the form of a geriatric helpline are useful initiatives to support the needs and the psychological well-being of older adults during a health crisis.","Wahl, A.-S.; Benson, G.

6653,Multi-omics study revealing tissue-dependent putative mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 drug targets on viral infections and complex diseases,"Drug target prioritization for new targets and drug repurposing of existing drugs for COVID-19 treatment are urgently needed for the current pandemic. COVID-19 drugs targeting human proteins will potentially result in less drug resistance but could also exhibit unintended effects on other complex diseases. Here we pooled 353 candidate drug targets of COVID-19 from clinical trial registries and the literature and estimated their putative causal effects in 11 SARS-CoV-2 related tissues on 622 complex human diseases. By constructing a disease atlas of drug targets for COVID-19, we prioritise 726 target-disease associations with evidence of causality using robust Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization evidence (http://epigraphdb.org/covid-19/ctda/). Triangulating these MR findings with historic drug trial information and the druggable genome, we ranked and prioritised three genes DHODH, ITGB5 and JAK2 targeted by three marketed drugs (Leflunomide, Cilengitide and Baricitinib) which may have repurposing potential with careful risk assessment. This study evidences the value of our integrative approach in prioritizing and repurposing drug targets, which will be particularly applicable when genetic association studies of COVID-19 are available in the near future.

3452,Forecasting COVID-19 impact in India using pandemic waves Nonlinear Growth Models,"The ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in China and devastated a vast majority of countries. In India, COVID-19 cases are steadily increasing since January 30, 2020, and the government-imposed lockdown across the country to curtail community transmission. COVID-19 forecasts have played an important role in capturing the probability of infection and the basic reproduction rate. In this study, we predicted some trajectories of trajectories associated with COVID-19 in the coming days in India using an Auto-regression integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and Richards model. By the end of April 2020, the incidence of new cases is predicted to be 5200 (95% CI: 4650 to 6002) through the ARIMA model versus be 6378 (95% CI: 4904 to 7851) Richard model. We estimated that there would be a total of 197 (95% CI: 118 to 277) deaths and drop down in the recovery rates will reach around 501 (95% CI: 245 to 758) by the end of April 2020. These estimates can help to strengthen the implementation of strategies to increase the health system capacity and enactment of social distancing measures all over India.","Kumar, P.; Singh, R.

19732,Adenovirus and RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines: perceptions and acceptance among healthcare workers,"ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to compare the perception, confidence, hesitancy, and acceptance rate of various COVID-19 vaccine types among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Saudi Arabia, a nation with MERS-CoV experience.

DesignNational cross-sectional, pilot-validated questionnaire.

SettingOnline, self-administered questionnaire among HCWs.

ParticipantsA total of 2,007 HCWs working in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia participated; 75.3% completed the survey and were included in the analysis.

InterventionData were collected through an online survey sent to HCWs during November 1-15, 2020. The main outcome measure was HCW acceptance of COVID-19 candidate vaccines. The associated factors of vaccination acceptance were identified through a logistic regression analysis and via measurement of the level of anxiety, using the generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD7) scale.

ResultsAmong the 1512 HCWs who were included, 62.4% were women, 70.3% were between 21 and 40 years of age, and the majority (62.2%) were from tertiary hospitals. In addition, 59.5% reported knowing about at least one vaccine; 24.4% of the participants were sure about their willingness to receive the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, and 20.9% were willing to receive the RNA BNT162b2 vaccine. However, 18.3% reported that they would refuse to receive the Ad5-vectored vaccine, and 17.9% would refuse the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine. Factors that influenced the differential readiness of HCWs included their perceptions of the vaccines efficiency in preventing the infection (33%), their personal preferences (29%), and the vaccines manufacturing country (28.6%).

ConclusionsAwareness by HCWs of the several COVID-19 candidate vaccines could improve their perceptions and acceptance of vaccination. Reliable sources on vaccine efficiency could improve vaccine uptake, so healthcare authorities should use reliable information to decrease vaccine hesitancy among frontline healthcare providers.","Temsah, M.

4416,Age could be driving variable SARS-CoV-2 epidemic trajectories worldwide,"BackgroundCurrent geographic spread of documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections shows heterogeneity. This study explores the role of age in potentially driving differentials in infection spread, epidemic potential, and rates of disease severity and mortality across countries.

MethodsAn age-stratified deterministic mathematical model that describes SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics was applied to 159 countries and territories with a population [&ge;]1 million.

ResultsAssuming worst-case scenario for the pandemic, the results indicate that there could be stark regional differences in epidemic trajectories driven by differences in the distribution of the population by age. In the African Region (median age: 18.9 years), the median R0 was 1.05 versus 2.05 in the European Region (median age: 41.7 years), and the median (per 100 persons) for the infections rate was 22.5 (versus 69.0), for severe and/or critical disease cases rate was 3.3 (versus 13.0), and for death rate was 0.5 (versus 3.9).

ConclusionsAge could be a driver of variable SARS-CoV-2 epidemic trajectories worldwide. Countries with sizable adult and/or elderly populations and smaller children populations may experience large and rapid epidemics in absence of interventions. Meanwhile, countries with predominantly younger age cohorts may experience smaller and slower epidemics. These predictions, however, should not lead to complacency, as the pandemic could still have a heavy toll nearly everywhere.","Ayoub, H. H.; Chemaitelly, H.; Seedat, S.; Mumtaz, G.

SARS-CoV-2 has a robust person-to-person transmission rate and an asymptomatic period of two weeks or more, leading to widespread infection that has overwhelmed healthcare infrastructures around the globe. Effective public health measures require extensive, accurate, and rapid testing to determine infection rates.

8383,Lopinavir-Ritonavir in treatment of COVID-19: A dynamic systematic benefit-risk assessment,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is an ongoing, global public health crisis for which safe and effective treatments need to be identified. The benefit-risk balance for use of lopinavir-ritonavir in COVID-19 needs to be monitored on an ongoing basis, therefore a systematic benefit-risk assessment was designed and conducted. A key objective of this study was to provide a platform for a dynamic systematic benefit-risk evaluation; although initially this evaluation is likely to contain limited information, it is required due to the urgent unmet public need. Importantly it allows additional data to be incorporated as it becomes available, and re-evaluation of the benefit-risk profile.

MethodsA systematic benefit-risk assessment was conducted using the Benefit-Risk Action team (BRAT) framework. The exposure of interest was lopinavir-ritonavir treatment in COVID-19 compared to standard of care, placebo or other treatments. A literature search was conducted in PubMed and EmBase to identify peer-reviewed papers reporting clinical outcomes. Two clinicians constructed a value tree and ranked key benefits and risks in order of considered clinical importance.

ResultsIn comparison to standard of care, data for several key benefits and risks were identified for lopinavir-ritonavir. Time to clinical improvement was not significantly different for lopinavir-ritonavir in comparison to standard of care (HR=1.31, 95% CI:0.95, 1.80). There appeared to be fewer serious adverse events with lopinavir-ritonavir (20%) vs standard of care (32%). In particular, there were fewer cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome with lopinavir-ritonavir compared to standard of care (13% vs 27%). Limited data were available for comparison of lopinavir-ritonavir to other treatments.

ConclusionsBased on currently available data, there was no clear benefit for use of lopinavir-ritonavir compared to standard of care in severe COVID-19. Risk data suggested a possible decrease in serious adverse events, including acute respiratory distress syndrome. Overall, the benefit-risk profile for lopinavir-ritonavir in severe COVID-19 cannot be considered positive until further efficacy and effectiveness data become available.","Osborne, V.; Davies, M.; Lane, S.; Evans, A.; Denyer, J.; Dhanda, S.; Roy, D.; Shakir, S.

Although the majority of infections are mild, severe and critical COVID-19 patients face deterioration of respiratory function, and may also present extrapulmonary manifestations, mostly affecting the kidney, digestive tract, heart and nervous system. Here, we prospectively evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material by RT-PCR in urine samples obtained from critical care COVID-19 patients. In 51 patients included, we found higher serum creatinine levels, a longer hospital stay and a more frequent dialysis need in urine-positive patients.

12100,COVID-19 in-hospital mortality and mode of death in a dynamic and non-restricted tertiary care model in Germany,"BackgroundReported mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 patients varies substantially, particularly in critically ill patients. So far COVID-19 in-hospital mortality and modes of death under optimised care conditions have not been systematically studied.

MethodsThis retrospective observational monocenter cohort study was performed after implementation of a non-restricted, dynamic tertiary care model at the University Medical Center Freiburg, an experienced ARDS and ECMO referral center. All hospitalised patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality, secondary endpoints included major complications and modes of death. A multistate analysis and a Cox regression analysis for competing risk models were performed. Modes of death were determined by two independent reviewers.

ResultsBetween February 25, and May 8, 213 patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 65 years, 129 patients (61%) were male. 70 patients (33%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), of which 57 patients (81%) received mechanical ventilation and 23 patients (33%) extracorporeal membrane-oxygenation (ECMO) support. According to the multistate model the probability to die within 90 days after COVID-19 onset was 24% in the whole cohort. If the levels of care at time of study entry were accounted for, the probabilities to die were 16% if the patient was initially on a regular ward, 47% if in the ICU and 57% if mechanical ventilation was required at study entry. Age [&ge;]65 years and male sex were predictors for in-hospital death. Predominant complications - as judged by two independent reviewers - determining modes of death were multi-organ failure, septic shock and thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications.

ConclusionIn a dynamic care model COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality remained substantial. In the absence of potent antiviral agents, strategies to alleviate or prevent the identified complications should be investigated. In this context, multistate analyses enable comparison of models-of-care and treatment strategies and allow estimation and allocation of health care resources.

Additionally, we included representative histopathologic post-mortem findings from several COVID-19 cases that underwent autopsy at our institution.

Results111 patients were identified, of which 54 had received tocilizumab while 57 had not. Receiving tocilizumab was associated with a higher risk of secondary bacterial (48.1% vs. 28.1%, p=0.029 and fungal (5.6% vs. 0%, p=0.112) infections. Consistent with higher number of infections, patients who received tocilizumab had higher mortality (35.2% vs. 19.3%, p=0.020). Seven cases underwent autopsy. In 3 cases who received tocilizumab, there was evidence of pneumonia on pathology. Of the 4 cases that had not been given tocilizumab, 2 showed evidence of aspiration pneumonia and 2 exhibited diffuse alveolar damage.

ConclusionsExperimental therapies are currently being applied to COVID-19 outside of clinical trials. Anti-inflammatory therapies such as anti-IL-6 therapy have the potential to impair viral clearance, predispose to secondary infection, and cause harm. We seek to raise physician awareness of these issues and highlight the need to better understand the immune response in COVID-19.","Kimmig, L. M.; Wu, D.; Gold, M.; Pettit, N.

13499,Colorimetric Test for Fast Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Nasal and Throat Swabs,"Mass testing is fundamental to face the pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 discovered at the end of 2019. To this aim, it is necessary to establish reliable, fast and cheap tools to detect viral particles in biological material so to identify the people capable to spread the infection. We demonstrate that a colorimetric biosensor based on gold nanoparticle (AuNP) interaction induced by SARS-CoV-2 lends itself as an outstanding tool for detecting viral particles in nasal and throat swabs. The extinction spectrum of a colloidal solution of multiple viral-target gold nanoparticles - AuNPs functionalized with antibodies targeting three surface proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (spike, envelope and membrane) - is redshifted in few minutes when mixed to a solution containing the viral particle. The optical density of the mixed solution measured at 560 nm was compared to the threshold cycle (Ct) of a Real Time-PCR (gold standard for detecting the presence of viruses) finding that the colorimetric method is able to detect very low viral load with a detection limit approaching that of RT-PCR. Since the method is sensitive to the infecting viral particle rather than to its RNA, the achievements reported here open new perspective not only in the context of the current and possible future pandemics, but also in microbiology as the biosensor proves itself to be a powerful though simple tool for measuring the viral particle concentration.","Della Ventura, B.; Cennamo, M.; Minopoli, A.; Campanile, R.; Bolletti Censi, S.; Terracciano, D.; Portella, G.; Velotta, R.",2020-08-18,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.15.20175489,1,Raffaele Velotta,"University of Naples \""Federico II\""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20175489v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20175489v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1021/acssensors.0c01742
3027,Epidemiological Tools that Predict Partial Herd Immunity to SARS Coronavirus 2,"The outbreak of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which occurred in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has caused a worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, there is a lack of epidemiological tools to guide effective public policy development. Here we present epidemiological evidence that SARS-CoV-2 S type exited Wuhan or other epicenters in China earlier than L type and conferred partial resistance to the virus on infected populations. Analysis of regional disparities in incidence has revealed that a sharp decline in influenza epidemics is a useful surrogate indicator for the undocumented spread of SARS-CoV-2. The biggest concern in the world is knowing when herd immunity has been achieved and scheduling a time to regain the living activities of each country. This study provides a useful tool to guide the development of local policies to contain the virus.","Kamikubo, Y.; Takahashi, A.",2020-03-27,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.25.20043679,1,Atsushi Takahashi,Kibi International University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043679v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043679v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
14241,Occurrence of Pneumothorax and Pneumomediastinum in Covid-19 patients during non-invasive ventilation with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure,"BackgroundAcute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure (AHRF) is a common complication of Covid-19 related pneumonia, for which non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with Helmet Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is widely used. During past epidemics of SARS and MERS pneumomediastinum (PNM) and pneumothorax (PNX) were common complications (respectively 1.7-12% and 16,4%) either spontaneous or associated to ventilation.

MethodsAim of our retrospective study was to investigate the incidence of PNX/PNM in COVID-19 pneumonia patients treated with CPAP. Moreover, we examined the correlation between PNX/PNM and Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) values. We collected data from patients admitted to ""Luigi Sacco"" University Hospital of Milan from 21/02/2020 to 06/05/2020 with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring CPAP.

ResultsOne-hundred-fifty-four patients were enrolled. During hospitalization 3 PNX and 2 PNM occurred (3.2%). Out of these five patients 2 needed invasive ventilation after PNX, two died. In the overall population, 42 patients (27%) were treated with High-PEEP (>10 cmH2O), and 112 with Low-PEEP ([&le;]10 cmH2O). All the PNX/PNM occurred in the High-PEEP group (5/37 vs 0/112, p<0,001).

ConclusionThe incidence of PNX appears to be lower in COVID-19 than SARS and MERS, but their occurrence is accompanied by high mortality and worsening of clinical conditions. Considering the association of PNX/PNM with high PEEP we suggest using the lower PEEP as possible to prevent these complications.

MethodWe performed a comprehensive literature search of several databases to find studies that assessed VTE in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a primary outcome of all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation. We also evaluated the clinical characteristics of VTE sufferers.

ResultsEight studies have been included with a total of 1237 pooled subjects. Venous thromboembolism was associated with higher mortality (RR 2.48 (1.35, 4.55), p=0.003; I2 5%, p=0.35) after we performed sensitivity analysis, ICU admission (RR 2.32 (1.53, 3.52), p<0.0001; I2 80%, p <0.0001), and mechanical ventilation need (RR 2.73 (1.56, 4.78), p=0.0004; I2 77%, p=0.001). Furthermore, it was also associated to male gender (RR 1.21 (1.08, 1.35), p=0.0007; I2 12%, p=0.34), higher white blood cells count (MD 1.24 (0.08, 2.41), 0.04; I2 0%; 0.26), D-dimer (MD 4.49 (2.74, 6.25), p<0.00001; I2 67%, p=0.009) and LDH levels (MD 70.93 (19.33, 122.54), p<0.007; I2 21%, p=0.28). In addition, after sensitivity analysis was conducted, VTE also associated with older age (MD 2.79 (0.06, 5.53), p=0.05; I2 25%, p=0.24) and higher CRP levels (MD 2.57 (0.88, 4.26); p=0.003; I2 0%, p=0.96).

ConclusionVenous thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients was associated with increased mortality, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation requirement. Male gender, older age, higher levels of biomarkers, including WBC count, D-Dimer, and LDH were also being considerably risks for developing VTE in COVID-19 patients during hospitalization.","Henrina, J.; Putra, I.

MethodsWe included 477 adult cases that died after admission from March 1 to March 31, 2020: 281 with confirmed COVID-19, 58 probable COVID-19, and 138 who died of other causes.

ResultsThe number of comorbidities was high in the confirmed COVID-19, and CI was common (30%: 21.1% dementia; 8.9% mild cognitive impairment). Subjects with CI were older, more lived in nursing homes and had shorter times from symptom onset to death than those without CI. COVID-19 patients with CI were rarely admitted to the ICU and fewer received non-invasive mechanical ventilation, but palliative care was provided more often.

12244,Serial Profiling of SARS-CoV-2 Antigens and Antibodies in COVID-19 Patient Plasma,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected millions of people worldwide. PCR tests are currently the gold standard for diagnosis of the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and serology tests are used to detect seroconversion in infected patients. However, there is a lack of quantitative and ultra-sensitive viral antigen tests for COVID-19. Here we show that Single Molecule Array (Simoa) assays can quantitatively detect SARS-CoV-2 spike, S1 subunit, and nucleocapsid antigens in the plasma of COVID-19 patients. Combined with Simoa anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological assays, we show correlation between production of antibodies and clearance of viral antigens from serial plasma samples from COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of viral antigens in blood correlates with disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens in the blood could be a marker for severe COVID-19 cases.

2297,Household transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in the time of unprecedented travel lockdown in China,"ImportanceSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in the city of Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and then spread globally. Limited information is available for characterizing epidemiological features and transmission patterns in the regions outside of Hubei Province. Detailed data on transmission at the individual level could be an asset to understand the transmission mechanisms and respective patterns in different settings.

ObjectiveTo reconstruct infection events and transmission clusters of SARS-CoV-2 for estimating epidemiological characteristics at household and non-household settings, including super-spreading events, serial intervals, age- and gender-stratified risks of infection in China outside of Hubei Province.

Design, Setting, and Participants9,120 confirmed cases reported online by 264 Chinese urban Health Commissions in 27 provinces from January 20 to February 19, 2020. A line-list database is established with detailed information on demographic, social and epidemiological characteristics. The infection events are categorized into the household and non-household settings.

ExposuresConfirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresInformation about demographic characteristics, social relationships, travel history, timelines of potential exposure, symptom onset, confirmation, and hospitalization were extracted from online public reports. 1,407 infection events formed 643 transmission clusters were reconstructed.

ResultsIn total 34 primary cases were identified as super spreaders, and 5 household super-spreading events were observed. The mean serial interval is estimated to be 4.95 days (standard deviation: 5.24 days) and 5.19 days (standard deviation: 5.28 days) for households and non-household transmissions, respectively. The risk of being infected outside of households is higher for age groups between 18 and 64 years, whereas the hazard of being infected within households is higher for age groups of young (<18) and elderly (>65) people.

Conclusions and RelevanceThe identification of super-spreading events, short serial intervals, and a higher risk of being infected outside of households for male people of age between 18 and 64 indicate a significant barrier to the case identification and management, which calls for intensive non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g. cancellation of public gathering, limited access of public services) as the potential mitigation strategies.

20224,Migration and Outbreaks of Vaccine-Preventable Disease in Europe: A Systematic Review,"BackgroundMigrant populations (defined as foreign-born) are one of several under-immunised groups in the EU/EEA, yet little is known about how they are affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). This information is vital to develop targeted strategies to improve the health of diverse migrant communities and to assess risk factors and correlations with major European peaks in incidence of key VPDs over time.

MethodsWe did a systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42019157473; Medline, EMBASE, and Global Health January 2000 to October 2019) adhering to PRISMA guidelines, to identify studies on VPD outbreaks (measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, polio, hepatitis A, N meningitidis, and H influenzae) in migrants residing in the EU/EEA and Switzerland.

Results45 studies were included, reporting on 47 distinct VPD outbreaks across 13 countries (26 [55%] were reported between 2010 and 2020, including 16 [34%] since 2015). Most reported outbreaks involving migrants were of measles (n=24; 6578 total cases), followed by varicella (n=11; 596 cases), hepatitis A (n=7; 1510 cases), rubella (n=3; 487 cases) and mumps (n=2; 295 cases). 19 (40%) of outbreaks, predominantly varicella and measles, were reported in temporary camps or shelters for asylum seekers and refugees. Of 11 varicella outbreaks, 82% were associated with adult migrants. Half of measles outbreaks (n=12) were associated with migrants from Eastern European countries, often involving migrants of Roma ethnicity.

ConclusionsMigrants represent one of several under-immunised groups involved in VPD outbreaks in Europe, with adult and child refugees and asylum seekers residing in shelters or temporary camps at particular risk, alongside specific nationality groups. Vulnerability varies by disease, setting, and individual demographics, highlighting the importance of tailoring strategies for implementing catch-up vaccination to specific groups, alongside the strengthening of routine data collection, in order to meet regional and global vaccination targets. Better understanding vaccine uptake and demand issues in migrant groups, and reducing the barriers they face to accessing vaccination services, is urgently needed, with direct implications for COVID-19 vaccine delivery at the current time. Strengthening vaccine delivery to migrant populations will require a greater focus on co-designing vaccine uptake strategies in close collaboration with affected communities.

4128,Effectiveness of quarantine measure on transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Hong Kong,"The rapid expansion of COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic. Although quarantine measures have been used widely, the critical steps among them to suppress the outbreak without a huge social-economic loss remain unknown. Hong Kong, unlike other regions in the world, had a massive number of travellers from Mainland China during the early expansion period, and yet the spread of virus has been relatively limited. Understanding the effect of control measures to reduce the transmission in Hong Kong can improve the control of the virus spreading.

We have developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) meta-population model that can stratify the infections into imported and subsequent local infections, and therefore to obtain the control effects on transmissibility in a region with many imported cases. We fitted the model to both imported and local confirmed cases with symptom onset from 18 January to 29 February 2020 in Hong Kong with daily transportation data and the transmission dynamics from Wuhan and Mainland China.

The model estimated that the reproductive number was dropped from 2.32 to 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.86) after an infected case was estimated to be quarantined half day before the symptom onset, corresponding to the incubation time of 5.43 days (95% CI, 1.30-9.47). If the quarantine happened about one day after the onset, community spread would be likely to occur, indicated by the reproductive number larger than one. The results suggest that the early quarantine for a suspected case before the symptom onset is a key factor to suppress COVID-19.","Yuan, H.-Y.; Mao, A.; Han, G.; Yuan, H.; Pfeiffer, D.",2020-04-11,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.09.20059006,1,Hsiang-Yu Yuan,City University of Hong Kong,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059006v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059006v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA

The number of polymorphic sites (i.e. sites with multiple alleles) within samples ranged from 0-13, with 72% of samples (295/406) having at least one polymorphic site. Correlation between number of polymorphic sites and coverage was very low for both sequencing methods (R2 < 0.1, p < 0.05). Polymorphisms were observed >1 sample at 66 sites (range: 2-38 samples). The minor allele frequency (MAF) at each shared polymorphic site was 0.03% - 48.5%. 33/66 sites occurred in ORF1a1b, and 37/66 changes were non-synonymous. At 10/66 sites, derived alleles were found in samples sequenced using both methods. Polymorphic amplicon samples were found at 10/10 positions, while polymorphic RNA-Seq samples were found at 7/10 positions. In conclusion, our results suggest that intra-host variation is prevalent among clinical samples. While mutations resulting from amplification and/or sequencing errors cannot be excluded, the observation of shared polymorphic sites with high MAF across multiple samples and sequencing methods is consistent with true underlying variation. Further investigation into intra-host evolutionary dynamics, particularly with longitudinal sampling, is critical for broader understanding of disease progression.","Rose, R.; Nolan, D.

9510,Identifying Non-traditional Epidemic Disease Risk Factors associated to major Health Events from WHO and World Bank Open Data,"ObjectivesHealth events emerge from a multifactorial milieu involving host, community, environment, and pathogen factors. Therefore, developing accurate forecasting models to improve epidemic prediction towards better prevention and capabilities management is a complex task. Here, we describe an exploratory analysis to identify non-health risk factors that could improve the forecast and events risk signals using a feasible and practical approach by combining surveillance report data with non-health data from open data sources.

MethodsA line listing was developed using information from the World Health Organization Disease Outbreaks News from 2016-2018. A database was created merging the line listing data with non-health indicators from the World Bank. Poisson regression models employing forward imputations were used to establish relationships and predict values over the dependent variable (health event frequency); which are the health events reported by each country to WHO during 2016-2018.

FindingsThe resulting regression model provided evidence that changes in non-health factors important to community experiences impact the risk of the number of major health events that a country could experience. Three non-health indicators (extrinsic factors) were associated significantly to event frequency (population urban change, gross domestic product change per capita--a novel factor, and average forest area). An exploratory analysis of the current COVID-19 pandemic suggested similar associations, but confounding by global disease burden is likely.

ConclusionContinued development of forecasting approaches capturing available whole-of-society extrinsic factors (non-health factors); could improve the risk management process through earlier hazard identification, and as importantly inform strategic decision processes in multisectoral strategies to preventing, detecting, and responding to pandemic-threat events.","Lugo-Robles, R.

12733,Spreading of COVID-19 in Italy as the spreading of a wave packet,"We find that the spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy can be described as the propagation of a wave packet in a dispersive medium where the effect of Lockdown is simulated by the dispersion relation of the medium. We start expanding a previous statistical analysis based on the official data provided by the Italian civil protection during 100 days, from March 2nd to June 9th. As the total number of people infected with the virus is uncertain, we have considered the trend of ICU patients and the sum of hospitalized patients and the deceased. Both the corresponding curves are well approximated by the same function depending on four free parameters. The model allows to predict the short term behavior of the pandemic and to estimate the benefits due to lockdown measures.","Feoli, A.; Iannella, A.

17401,Risk factors for outcomes of COVID-19 patients: an observational study of 795 572 patients in Russia,"BackgroundSeveral factors that could affect survival and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients require larger studies and closer attention.

ObjectiveTo investigate the impact of factors including whether COVID-19 was clinically or laboratory-diagnosed, influenza vaccination, former or current tuberculosis, HIV, and other comorbidities on the hospitalized patients outcomes.

DesignObservational nationwide cohort study.

PatientsAll subjects, regardless of age, admitted to 4,251 Russian hospitals indexed in the Federal Register of COVID-19 patients between March 26, 2020, and June 3, 2020. All included patients for which complete clinical data were available were divided into two cohorts, with laboratory- and clinically verified COVID-19.

MeasurementsWe analyzed patients age and sex, COVID-19 ICD-10 code, the length of the hospital stay, and whether they required ICU treatment or invasive mechanical ventilation. The other variables for analysis were: verified diagnosis of pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, diseases of the endocrine system, cancer/malignancy, HIV, tuberculosis, and the data on influenza vaccination in the previous six months.

ResultsThis study enrolled 705,572 COVID-19 patients aged from 0 to 121 years, 50.4% females. 164,195 patients were excluded due to no confirmed COVID-19 (n=143,357) or insufficient and invalid clinical data (n=20,831). 541,377 participants were included in the study, 413,950 (76.5%) of them had laboratory-verified COVID-19, and 127,427 patients (23.5%) with the clinical verification. Influenza vaccination reduced the risk of transfer to the ICU (OR 0.76), mechanical ventilation requirement (OR 0.74), and the risk of death (HR 0.77). TB increased the mortality risk (HR 1.74) but reduced the likelihood of transfer to the ICU (OR 0.27). HIV comorbidity significantly increased the risks of transfer to the ICU (OR 2.46) and death (HR 1.60). Patients with the clinically verified COVID-19 had a shorter duration of hospital stay (HR 1.45) but a higher risk of mortality (HR 1.08) and the likelihood of being ventilated (OR 1.36). According to the previously published data, age, male sex, endocrine disorders, and cardiovascular diseases increased the length of hospital stay, the risk of death, and transfer to the ICU.

LimitationsThe study did not include a control group of subjects with no COVID-19. Because of that, some of the identified factors could not be specific for COVID-19.

ConclusionsInfluenza vaccination could reduce the severity of the hospitalized patients clinical outcomes, including mortality, regardless of age, social, and economic group. The other factors considered in the study did not reduce the assessed risks, but we observed several non-trivial associations that may optimize the management of COVID-19 patients.","Demkina, A.

8444,SARS-CoV-2 SEROPREVALENCE AMONG ALL WORKERS IN A TEACHING HOSPITAL IN SPAIN: UNMASKING THE RISK.,"BackgroundHealth-care workers (HCW) are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but few studies have evaluated prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among them.

ObjectiveTo determine the seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 in all HCW.

MethodsCross-sectional study (April 14th- 27th, 2020) of all HCW at Hospital Universitario Fundacion Alcorcon, a second level teaching hospital in Madrid, Spain. SARS-CoV-2 IgG was measured by ELISA. HCW were classified by professional category, working area, and risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure.

ResultsAmong 2919 HCW, 2590 (90.5%) were evaluated. Mean age was 43.8 years (SD 11.1) and 73.9% were females. Globally, 818 (31.6%) workers were IgG positive, with no differences for age, sex or previous diseases. Among them, 48.5% did not report previous symptoms. Seropositivity was more frequent in high (33.1%) and medium (33.8%) than in low-risk areas (25.8%, p = 0.007), but no difference was found for hospitalization areas attending COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients (35.5 vs 38.3% p = NS). HCW with a previous SARS-CoV2 PCR positive test were IgG seropositive in 90.8%. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, seropositivity was associated with being physicians (OR 2.37, CI95% 1.61-3.49), nurses (OR 1.67, CI95% 1.14-2.46), or nurse- assistants (OR 1.84, CI95% 1.24-2.73), HCW working at COVID-19 hospitalization areas (OR 1.71, CI95% 1.22-2.40), non-COVID-19 hospitalization areas (OR 1.88, CI95% 1.30-2.73), and at the Emergency Room (OR 1.51, CI95% 1.01-2.27)

ConclusionsSeroprevalence uncovered a high rate of infection previously unnoticed among HCW. Patients not suspected of having COVID-19 as well as asymptomatic HCW may be a relevant source for nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Galan, I.; Velasco, M.; Casas, M. L.; Goyanes, M.

8012,Study on the expression levels of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at different period of disease and its related factors in 192 cases of COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundIn 2020, the current outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) has constituted a global pandemic. But the question about the immune mechanism of patients with COVID-19 is unclear and cause particular concern to the world. Here, we launched a follow-up analysis of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 of 192 COVID-19 patients, aiming to depict a kinetics profile of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and explore the related factors of antibodies expression against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patient.

MethodsA total of 192 COVID-19 patients enrolled in the designated hospital of Guangzhou, Guangzhou Eighth Peoples Hospital, from January to February 2020 were selected as the study cohort. A cohort of 130 COVID-19 suspects who had been excluded from SARS-CoV-2 infected by negative RT-PCR result and 209 healthy people were enrolled in this study. Detection of IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 were performed by Chemiluminescence immunoassay in different groups.

ResultsIt has been found that the seroconversion time of IgM against SARS-CoV-2 in most patients was 5-10 days after the symptoms onset, and then rose rapidly, reaching a peak around 2 to 3 weeks, and the median peak concentration was 2.705 AU / mL. The peak of IgM maintained within one week, and then enters the descending channel. IgG seroconverted later than or synchronously with IgM, reaching peaks around 3 to 4 weeks.The median peak concentration was 33.998AU / ml,which was higher than that of IgM. IgM titers begins to gradually decrease after reaching the peak in the 4th week, after the 8th week, a majority of IgM in patients serum started to turn negative. On the contrary, titers of IgG began to decline slightly after the fifth week, and more than 90% of results of patients were positive after 8 weeks. Additionally, the concentration of antibodies positively correlated with the severity of the disease and the duration of virus exist in host.

ConclusionWe depict a kinetics profile of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients and found out that the levels of antibodies were related to the disease severity, age, gender and virus clearance or continuous proliferation of COVID-19 patients.","Ou, J.; Tan, M.; He, H.; Tan, H.; Mai, J.; Long, Y.; Jiang, X.; He, Q.; Huang, Y.; Li, Y.; Chen, R.; Li, L.; Li, F.; Shi, Y.",2020-05-26,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.22.20102525,1,Yaling Shi,"Guangzhou Eighth People\'s Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou,China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.20102525v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.20102525v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
9857,"Seroprevalence of Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in Healthcare Workers in Non-epidemic Region: A Hospital Report in Iwate Prefecture, Japan","BackgroundAs of June 18, 2020, Iwate is the only one of 47 prefectures in Japan with no confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Serological survey for COVID-19 antibodies is crucial in area with low prevalence as well as epidemic area when addressing health and social issues caused by COVID-19.

MethodsSerum samples from healthcare workers (n = 1,000, mean 40 {+/-} 11 years) of Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital, Iwate, Japan were tested for the prevalence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies. Two laboratory-based quantitative tests (Abbotts and Roches immunoassays) and one point-of-care (POC) qualitative test performed simultaneously. Sensitivity and specificity were 100%, 99.6% in Abbotts immunoassay; 100%, 99.8% in Roches immunoassay; 97.8%, 94.6% in Alfa POC test, respectively.

ResultsThe laboratory-based quantitative tests showed positive in 4 of 1,000 samples (0.4%) (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.79): 4/1,000 (0.4%) (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.79) in Abbott; 0/1,000 (0%) in Roche. Positive samples were not detected for both Abbotts and Roches immunoassays. The POC qualitative test showed positive in 33 of 1,000 samples (3.3%) (95% CI: 2.19 to 4.41). There were no samples with simultaneous positive reaction for two quantitative tests and a POC test.

ConclusionsInfected COVID-2 cases were not confirmed by a retrospective serological study in healthcare workers of our hospital. The POC qualitative tests with lower specificity have the potential for higher false positive reactions than the laboratory-based quantitative tests in areas with very low prevalence of COVID-19.","Nakamura, A.; Sato, R.; Ando, S.; Oana, N.; Nozaki, E.; Endo, H.; Miyate, Y.; Soma, J.; Miyata, G.",2020-06-19,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.15.20132316,3,Akihiro Nakamura,Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.20132316v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.20132316v3.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
19116,Characterizing the Dynamic of COVID-19 with a New Epidemic Model: Susceptible-Exposed-Symptomatic-Asymptomatic-Active-Removed,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread stealthily and presented a tremendous threat to the public. It is important to investigate the transmission dynamic of COVID-19 to help understand the impact of the disease on public health and economy. While a number of epidemic models have been available to study infectious diseases, they are in-adequate to describe the dynamic of COVID-19. In this paper, we develop a new epidemic model which utilizes a set of ordinary differential equations with unknown parameters to delineate the transmission process of COVID-19. Different from the traditional epidemic models, this model accounts for asymptomatic infections as well the lag between symptoms onset and the confirmation date of infection. We describe an estimation procedure for the unknown parameters in the proposed model by adapting the iterated filter-ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (IF-EAKF) algorithm to the reported number of confirmed cases. To assess the performance of our proposed model, we examine COVID-19 data in Quebec for the period of April 2, 2020 to May 10, 2020 and carry out sensitivity studies under a variety of assumptions. To reflect the transmission potential of an infected case, we derive the basic reproduction number from the proposed model. The estimated basic reproduction number suggests that the pandemic situation in Quebec for the period of April 2, 2020 to May 10, 2020 is not under control.","Yi, G.

18691,The Acceleration Index as a Test-Controlled Reproduction Number: Application to COVID-19 in France,"We show that the acceleration index, a novel indicator that measures acceleration and deceleration of viral spread (Baunez et al. 2020a,b), is essentially a test-controlled version of the reproduction number. As such it is a more accurate indicator to track the dynamics of an infectious disease outbreak in real time. We indicate a discrepancy between the acceleration index and the reproduction number, based on the infectivity and test rates and we provide a formal decomposition of this difference. When applied to French data for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our decomposition shows that the reproduction number consistently underestimates the resurgence of the pandemic since the summer of 2020, compared to the acceleration index which accounts for the time-varying volume of tests. Because the acceleration index aggregates all the relevant information and captures in real time the sizeable time variation featured by viral circulation, it is a sufficient statistic to track the pandemics propagation.

18112,Estimating COVID-19 Virus Prevalence from Records of Testing Rate and Test Positivity,"IntroductionPCR testing for COVID-19 is not done at random but selectively on suspected cases. This paper presents a method to estimate a ""genuine Virus Prevalence"" by quantifying and removing the bias related to selective testing.

MethodsData used are from nine (9) neighbouring countries in Western Europe that record similar epidemic trends despite differences in Testing Rate. Regression analysis is used to establish a relationship of declining Test Positivity with increased Testing Rate. By extrapolating this trend to an ""infinitely complete"" Testing Rate, an unbiased Test Positivity or ""genuine Virus Prevalence"" is computed. Via pairing of ""genuine Virus Prevalence"" with Excess-Deaths, a ""genuine Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) is also derived.

ResultsPeak levels of ""genuine Virus Prevalence"" were around 0.5 to 2% during the 1st epidemic ""wave"" (week 10 to week 20) and are approaching similar levels in the ongoing 2nd ""wave"" (week 34 onward). ""Genuine Virus Prevalence"" estimates are close to reported Seroprevalence in the studied countries with a correlation coefficient of 0.58. ""Genuine"" IFR is found comparable to closed-community model IFR. Finally, results of community mass-testing in Slovakia are within the estimated range of ""genuine Virus Prevalence"".

ConclusionsEstimates of ""genuine Virus Prevalence"" benchmark favourably to other indications of virus prevalence suggesting the estimation method is robust and potentially deployable beyond this initial dataset of countries. ""Genuine Virus Prevalence"" curves suggest that during the 1st epidemic ""wave"", curve flattening and waning happened at very modest levels of infection spread, either naturally or facilitated by government measures.","Everts, A.

18748,Effect of Vitamin D deficiency on COVID-19 status: A systematic review,"BackgroundOne major micronutrient known to have a possible protective effect against COVID-19 disease is vitamin D. This systematic review sought to identify and synthesise available evidence to aid the understanding of the possible effect of vitamin D deficiency on COVID-19 status and health outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

MethodsThree databases PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar were searched systematically to obtain English language journal article published within 1/12/2019 and 3/11/2020. The search consisted of the terms (""Vitamin D,"" OR ""25{square}Hydroxyvitamin D,"" OR ""Low Vitamin D."") AND (""COVID-19"" OR ""2019-nCoV"" OR ""Coronavirus"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"") AND (""disease severity"" OR ""IMV"" OR ""ICU admission"" OR ""mortality"" OR ""hospitalization"" OR ""infection""). We followed the recommended PRISMA guidelines in executing this study. After going through the screening of the articles, eleven articles were included in the review.

FindingsAlmost all the included studies reported a positive association between Vitamin D sufficiency and COVID-19 status and health outcomes. Vitamin D deficient patients (< 25 ng/mL) are 5.84 times [aOR=6.84, p=0.01] more likely to die from COVID-19 compared to the vitamin D sufficient people. Another study also found that Vitamin D deficiency is associated with higher risk of death with Hazard ratio (HR) 14.73, p<0.001. Vitamin D deficient (<12 ng/mL) people were 2.2 times [aOR=3.2, p=0.07] more likely to develop severe COVID-19 after adjusting for age, gender, obesity, cardiac disease, and kidney disease compared to the vitamin D sufficient people. One study found that after controlling for confounders, patients with low 25(OH)D (<30 ng/mL) level are more likely [aOR=1.45, p=<0.001] to be COVID-19 infected compared to the patients with 25(OH)D level >=30 ng/mL.

ConclusionFindings from the study included suggest Vitamin D may serve as a mitigating effect for covid-19 infection, severity and mortality. We recommend the need to encourage people to eat foods rich in vitamin D such as fish, red meat, liver and egg yolks whiles at the same time providing vitamin D supplements for individuals with COVID-19 in order to boost their immune systems.","Das, P.; Samad, N.; Ahinkorah, B.

6839,Identification of Immune complement function as a determinant of adverse SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome,"SO_SCPLOWUMMARYC_SCPLOWUnderstanding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for therapeutics and public health intervention strategies. Viral-host interactions can guide discovery of regulators of disease outcomes, and protein structure function analysis points to several immune pathways, including complement and coagulation, as targets of the coronavirus proteome. To determine if conditions associated with dysregulation of the complement or coagulation systems impact adverse clinical outcomes, we performed a retrospective observational study of 11,116 patients who presented with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that history of macular degeneration (a proxy for complement activation disorders) and history of coagulation disorders (thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and hemorrhage) are risk factors for morbidity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients - effects that could not be explained by age, sex, or history of smoking. Further, transcriptional profiling of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 650 control and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients demonstrated that in addition to innate Type-I interferon and IL-6 dependent inflammatory immune responses, infection results in robust engagement and activation of the complement and coagulation pathways. Finally, we conducted a candidate driven genetic association study of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease. Among the findings, our scan identified putative complement and coagulation associated loci including missense, eQTL and sQTL variants of critical regulators of the complement and coagulation cascades. In addition to providing evidence that complement function modulates SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome, the data point to putative transcriptional genetic markers of susceptibility. The results highlight the value of using a multi-modal analytical approach, combining molecular information from virus protein structure-function analysis with clinical informatics, transcriptomics, and genomics to reveal determinants and predictors of immunity, susceptibility, and clinical outcome associated with infection.","Ramlall, V.; Thangaraj, P.; Meydan, C.; Foox, J.; Butler, D.; May, B.; De Freitas, J.; Glicksberg, B.

13594,SARS-CoV-2 Serologic Assays in Control and Unknown Populations Demonstrate the Necessity of Virus Neutralization Testing.,"BackgroundTo determine how serologic antibody testing outcome links with virus neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 to ascertain immune protection status, we evaluated a unique set of individuals for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection and viral neutralization.

MethodsHerein, we compare several analytic platforms with 15 positive and 30 negative SARS-CoV-2 infected controls followed by viral neutralization assessment. We then applied these platforms in a clinically relevant population: 114 individuals with unknown histories of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsIn control populations, the best performing antibody detection assays were SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG (specificity 87%, sensitivity 100%, PPV 100%, NPV 93%), spike IgG3 (specificity 93%, sensitivity 97%, PPV 93%, NPV 97%), and nucleocapsid (NP) protein IgG (specificity 93%, sensitivity 97%, PPV 93%, NPV 97%). Neutralization of positive and negative control sera showed 100% agreement. 20 unknown individuals had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with 16 demonstrating virus neutralization. The antibody assays that best predicted virus neutralization were RBD IgG (misidentified 2), spike IgG3 (misidentified 1), and NP IgG (misidentified 2).

ConclusionThese data suggest that meaningful evaluation of antibody assay performance requires testing in an unknown population. Further, these results indicate coupling of virus neutralization analysis to a positive antibody test is required to categorize patients based on SARS-CoV-2 immune protection status following virus exposure or vaccine administration. One of the antibody detection platforms identified in this study followed by the pseudoneutralization or focus reduction assay would provide a practical testing strategy to assess for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with optimal prediction of correlates to neutralizing immunity.

14800,Estimating COVID-19 contribution to total excess mortality,"We compared the total excess mortality per week in relation to the reported Covid-19 related deaths in the Stockholm region (Sweden). Total excess mortality peaked under the weeks of high COVID-19-related mortality, but 25% of these deaths were not recognized as Covid-related. Most of these deaths occurred outside hospitals.

2252,"Estimation of SARS-CoV-2 mortality during the early stages of an epidemic: a modeling study in Hubei, China, and six regions in Europe","BackgroundAs of 16 May 2020, more than 4.5 million cases and more than 300,000 deaths from disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported. Reliable estimates of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection are essential to understand clinical prognosis, plan health care capacity and for epidemic forecasting. The case fatality ratio (CFR), calculated from total numbers of reported cases and reported deaths, is the most commonly reported metric, but can be a misleading measure of overall mortality. The objectives of this study were to: 1) simulate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 using publicly available surveillance data; 2) infer estimates of SARS-CoV-2 mortality adjusted for biases and examine the CFR, the symptomatic case fatality ratio (sCFR) and the infection fatality ratio (IFR) in different geographic locations.

Method and FindingsWe developed an age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model describing the dynamics of transmission and mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our model accounts for two biases: preferential ascertainment of severe cases and right-censoring of mortality. We fitted the transmission model to surveillance data from Hubei province, China and applied the same model to six regions in Europe: Austria, Bavaria (Germany), Baden-Wurttemberg (Germany), Lombardy (Italy), Spain and Switzerland. In Hubei, the baseline estimates were: CFR 2.4% (95% credible interval [CrI]: 2.1-2.8%), sCFR 3.7% (3.2-4.2%) and IFR 2.9% (2.4-3.5%). Estimated measures of mortality changed over time. Across the six locations in Europe estimates of CFR varied widely. Estimates of sCFR and IFR, adjusted for bias, were more similar to each other but still showed some degree of heterogeneity. Estimates of IFR ranged from 0.5% (95% CrI 0.4-0.6%) in Switzerland to 1.4% (1.1-1.6%) in Lombardy, Italy. In all locations, mortality increased with age. Among 80+ year olds, estimates of the IFR suggest that the proportion of all those infected with SARS-CoV-2 who will die ranges from 20% (95% CrI: 16-26%) in Switzerland to 34% (95% CrI: 28-40%) in Spain. A limitation of the model is that count data by date of onset are required and these are not available in all countries.

ConclusionsWe propose a comprehensive solution to the estimation of SARS-Cov-2 mortality from surveillance data during outbreaks. The CFR is not a good predictor of overall mortality from SARS-CoV-2 and should not be used for evaluation of policy or comparison across settings. Geographic differences in IFR suggest that a single IFR should not be applied to all settings to estimate the total size of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in different countries. The sCFR and IFR, adjusted for right-censoring and preferential ascertainment of severe cases, are measures that can be used to improve and monitor clinical and public health strategies to reduce the deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Author summaryO_ST_ABSWhy was this study done?C_ST_ABSO_LIReliable estimates of measures of mortality from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are needed to understand clinical prognosis, plan health care capacity and for epidemic forecasting.
C_LIO_LIThe case fatality ratio (CFR), the number of reported deaths divided by the number of reported cases at a specific time point, is the most commonly used metric, but is a biased measure of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection.
C_LIO_LIThe symptomatic case fatality ratio (sCFR) and overall infection fatality ratio (IFR) are alternative measures of mortality with clinical and public health relevance, which should be investigated further in different geographic locations.
C_LI

What did the researchers do and find?O_LIWe developed a mathematical model that describes infection transmission and death during a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. The model takes into account the delay between infection and death and preferential ascertainment of disease in people with severe symptoms, both of which affect the assessment of mortality.
C_LIO_LIWe applied the model to data from Hubei province in China, which was the first place affected by SARS-CoV-2, and to six locations in Europe: Austria, Bavaria (Germany), Baden-Wurttemberg (Germany), Lombardy (Italy), Spain and Switzerland, to estimate the CFR, the sCFR and the IFR.
C_LIO_LIEstimates of sCFR and IFR, adjusted for bias, were similar to each other and varied less geographically than the CFR. IFR was lowest in Switzerland (0.5%) and highest in Hubei province (2.9%). The IFR increased with age; among 80+ year olds, estimates ranged from 20% in Switzerland to 34% in Spain.
C_LI

What do these findings mean?O_LIThe CFR does not predict overall mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection well and should not be used for the evaluation of policy or for making comparisons between geographic locations.
C_LIO_LIThere are geographic differences in the IFR of SARS-CoV-2, which could result from differences in factors including emergency preparedness and response, and health service capacity.
C_LIO_LISARS-CoV-2 infection results in substantial mortality. Further studies should investigate ways to reduce death from SARS-CoV-2 in older people and to understand the causes of the differences between countries.

3475,Spatial variability in the risk of death from COVID-19 in 20 regions of Italy,"ObjectivesItaly has been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, becoming the nation with the third highest death toll in the world as of May 10th, 2020. We analyzed the severity of COVID-19 pandemic across 20 Italian regions.

MethodWe manually retrieved the daily cumulative numbers of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths attributed to COVID-19 across 20 Italian regions. For each region, we estimated the crude case fatality ratio and time-delay adjusted case fatality ratio (aCFR). We then assessed the association between aCFR and sociodemographic, health care and transmission factors using multivariate regression analysis.

ResultsThe overall aCFR in Italy was estimated at 17.4%. Lombardia exhibited the highest aCFR (24.7%) followed by Marche (19.3%), Emilia Romagna (17.7%) and Liguria (17.6%). Our aCFR estimate was greater than 10% for 12 regions. Our aCFR estimates were statistically associated with population density and cumulative morbidity rate in a multivariate analysis.

ConclusionOur aCFR estimates for overall Italy and for 7 out of 20 regions exceeded those reported for the most affected region in China. Our findings highlight the importance of social distancing to suppress incidence and reduce the death risk by preventing saturating the health care system.","Mizumoto, K.; Dahal, S.; Chowell, G.",2020-05-18,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.01.20049668,3,Kenji Mizumoto,Kyoto University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049668v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049668v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.5588/ijtld.20.0262

Natural experiments are currently being conducted on the impact of these interventions, but most of these occur at the subnational level - data not available in early global datasets. We describe the rapid development of the first comprehensive, labelled dataset of 1640 NPIs implemented at federal, provincial/territorial and municipal levels in Canada to guide COVID-19 research. For each intervention, we provide: a) information on timing to aid in longitudinal evaluation, b) location to allow for robust spatial analyses, and c) classification based on intervention type and target population, including classification aligned with a previously developed measure of government response stringency. This initial dataset release (v1.0) spans January 1st, and March 31st, 2020; bi-weekly data updates to continue for the duration of the pandemic. This novel dataset enables robust, inter-jurisdictional comparisons of pandemic response, can serve as a model for other jurisdictions and can be linked with other information about case counts, transmission dynamics, health care utilization, mobility data and economic indicators to derive important insights regarding NPI impact.","Mccoy, L.

14057,Analysis and validation of a highly sensitive one-step nested quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for specific detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, is posing a serious threat to global public health. Reverse transcriptase real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. Due to technical limitations, the reported positive rates of qRT-PCR assay of throat swab samples vary from 30%-60%. Therefore, the evaluation of alternative strategies to overcome the limitations of qRT-PCR is required. A previous study reported that one-step nested (OSN)-qRT-PCR revealed better suitability for detecting SARS-CoV-2. However, information on the analytical performance of OSN-qRT-PCR is insufficient. In this study, we aimed to analyze OSN-qRT-PCR by comparing it with droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and qRT-PCR by using a dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral RNA and a quality assessment panel. The clinical performance of OSN-qRT-PCR was also validated and compared with ddPCR and qRT-PCR using specimens from COVID-19 patients. The LoD (copies/ml) of qRT-PCR, ddPCR, and OSN-qRT-PCR were 520.1 (95% CI): 363.23-1145.69) for ORF1ab and 528.1 (95% CI: 347.7-1248.7) for N, 401.8 (95% CI: 284.8-938.3) for ORF1ab and 336.8 (95% CI: 244.6-792.5) for N, and 194.74 (95% CI: 139.7-430.9) for ORF1ab and 189.1 (95% CI: 130.9-433.9) for N, respectively. Of the 34 clinical samples from COVID-19 patients, the positive rates of OSN-qRT-PCR, ddPCR, and qRT-PCR were 82.35% (28/34), 67.65% (23/34), and 58.82% (20/34), respectively. In conclusion, the highly sensitive and specific OSN-qRT-PCR assay is superior to ddPCR and qRT-PCR assays, showing great potential as a technique for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with low viral loads.","Zhang, Y.; Dai, C.; Wang, H.; Gao, Y.; Li, T.; Fang, Y.; Shen, Z.; Chen, L.; Chen, Z.; Ma, X.; Li, M.",2020-09-01,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.27.20182832,1,Ming Li,The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.27.20182832v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.27.20182832v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
18896,"How do the public interpret COVID-19 swab test results? Comparing the impact of official information about results and reliability used in the UK, US and New Zealand: a randomised, controlled trial","ObjectivesTo assess the effects of different official information on public interpretation of a personal COVID-19 PCR ( swab) test result.

DesignA 5xx2 factorial, randomised, between-subjects experiment, comparing four wordings of information about the test result and a control arm of no additional information; for both positive and negative test results.

SettingOnline experiment using recruitment platform Respondi.

ParticipantsUK participants (n=1,744, after a pilot of n=1,657) collected by quota sampling to be proportional to the UK national population on age and sex.

InterventionsParticipants were given a hypothetical COVID-19 swab test result for  John who was presented as having a 50% chance of having COVID-19 based on symptoms alone. Participants were randomised to receive either a positive or negative result for  John, then randomised again to receive either no more information, or text information on the interpretation of COVID-19 test results copied from the public websites of the UKs National Health Service, the USs Centers for Disease Control, New Zealands Ministry of Health, or a modified version of the UKs wording incorporating uncertainty. Information identifying the source of the wording was removed.

Main outcome measuresParticipants were asked ""What is your best guess as to the percent chance that John actually had COVID-19 at the time of his test, given his result?""; questions about their feelings of trustworthiness in the result, their perceptions of the quality of the underlying evidence, and what action they felt  John should take in the light of his result.

ResultsOf those presented with a positive COVID-19 test result for  John, the mean estimate of the probability that he had the virus was 73%; for those presented with a negative result, 38%. There was no main effect of information (wording) on these means. However, those participants given the official information on the UK website, which did not mention any uncertainty around the test result, were significantly more likely to give a categorical (100% or 0%) answer (for positive result, p <.001; negative, p =.006). When asked how much they agreed that  John should self-isolate, those who were told his test was positive agreed to a greater extent (mean 86 on a 0-100 scale), but many of those who were told he had a negative result still agreed (mean 51). There was also an interaction between wording and test result (p < 0.001), with those seeing the New Zealand wording about the uncertainties of the test result significantly more likely to agree that he should continue to self-isolate after a negative test than those who saw the UK wording (p =.01), the experimental wording (p =.02) or no wording at all (p =.003). Participants rated positive test results more trustworthy and higher quality of evidence than negative results.

ConclusionsThe UK public perceive positive test results for COVID-19 as more reliable and trustworthy than negative results without being given any information about the reliability of the tests. When additionally given the UKs current official wording about the interpretation of the test results, people became more likely to interpret the results as definitive. The publics assessment of the face value of both the positive and negative test results was generally conservative. The proportion of participants who felt that a symptomatic individual who tests negative definitely should not self-isolate was highest among those reading the UK wording (17.4%) and lowest among those reading the New Zealand wording (3.8%) and US wording (5.1%).

What is already known on this topicO_LIDifferent countries have had different approaches to conveying the meaning of a COVID-19 swab test result, particularly regarding the uncertainties inherent in the result due to limitations of specificity and sensitivity.
C_LIO_LIPrevious research has suggested that peoples trust and understanding is not affected by conveying quantified uncertainties numerically, but that perceptions of the quality of the underlying evidence can affect trust.
C_LIO_LIIt is not known whether the different wordings around COVID-19 test uncertainties are likely to affect peoples trust in, or behavioural response to, the results they receive.
C_LI

What this study addsO_LIThis study provides the first empirical evidence to our knowledge of the responses the public have to COVID-19 swab test results.
C_LIO_LIIt suggests that the public have a higher degree of trust and confidence in positive swab test results than negative when they are not given any other information accompanying the result. The experimental wording that we created for this study appeared to boost their trust in and assessment of quality of positive test results, but did not change their lower ratings of negative results.
C_LIO_LIThe wording used by the UKs National Health Service, which does not include any cues of uncertainty in the result, was more likely to lead people to definitive (100% or 0%) answers to questions about the meaning of the result.
C_LIO_LIThe wording used by New Zealands Ministry of Health, which is more explicit about the reliability of the tests, appears to lead people to be more cautious about recommending that a test participant with a negative test (but still symptomatic) no longer needs to self-isolate.

11414,Multidisciplinary approach to COVID-19 risk communication: A framework and tool for individual and regional risk assessment,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exceeded over ten million cases globallywith no vaccine available yet. Different approaches are followed to mitigate its impact and reduce its spreading in different countries, but limiting mobility and exposure have been de-facto precaution to reduce transmission. However, a full lockdown cannot be sustained for a prolonged period. Evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach on risk zoning, personal and transmission risk assessment on a near real-time, and risk communication would support the optimized decisions to minimize the impact of coronavirus on our lives. This paper presents a framework to assess the individual and regional risk of COVID-19 along with risk communication tools and mechanisms. Relative risk scores on a scale of 100 represent the integrated risk of influential factors. The personal risk model incorporates: age, exposure history, symptoms, local risk and existing health condition, whereas regional risk is computed through the actual cases of COVID-19, public health risk factors, socioeconomic condition of the region, and immigration statistics. A web application tool (www.covira.info) has been developed, where anyone can assess their risk and find the guided information links primarily for Nepal. This study provides regional risk for Nepal, but the framework is scalable across the world. However, personal risk can be assessed immediately from anywhere.","Parajuli, R.

18626,A Retrospective Longitudinal Study of COVID-19 as Seen by a Large Urban Hospital in Chicago,"The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created high demand for medical resources, including personnel, intensive care unit beds, and ventilators. As thousands of patients are hospitalized, the disease has shown remarkable diversity in its manifestation; many patients with mild to no symptoms recover from the disease requiring minimal care, but some patients with severe disease progression require mechanical ventilation support in intensive care units (ICU) with an increased risk of death. Studying the characteristics of patients in these various strata can help us understand the varied progression of this disease, enable earlier interventions for at-risk patients, and help manage medical resources more efficiently. This paper presents a retrospective analysis of 10,123 COVID-19 patients treated at the Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, including their demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory values, vital signs, and clinical history. Specifically, we present a staging scheme based on discrete clinical events (i.e., admission to the hospital, admission to the ICU, mechanical ventilation, and death), and investigate the temporal trend of clinical variables and the effect of comorbidities in each of those stages. We then developed a prognostic model to predict ventilation demands at an individual patient level by analyzing baseline clinical variables, which entails (1) a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and a decision tree model to identify predictors for mechanical ventilation; and (2) a logistic regression model based on these risk factors to predict which patients will eventually need ventilatory support. Our results indicate that the prognostic model achieves an AUC of 0.823 (95% CI: 0.765-0.880) in identifying patients who will eventually require mechanical ventilation.","Chen, H.; Varatharajah, Y.; Stewart De Ramirez, S.

14841,The Effect of Early Hydroxychloroquine-based Therapy in COVID-19 Patients in Ambulatory Care Settings: A Nationwide Prospective Cohort Study,"ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Currently, there is no proven effective therapy nor vaccine for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Evidence regarding the potential benefit of early administration of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) therapy in symptomatic patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is not clear. METHODS: This observational prospective cohort study took place in 238 ambulatory fever clinics in Saudi Arabia, which followed the Ministry of Health (MOH) COVID-19 treatment guideline. This guideline included multiple treatment options for COVID-19 based on the best available evidence at the time, among which was Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Patients with confirmed COVD-19 (by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test) who presented to these clinics with mild to moderate symptoms during the period from 5-26 June 2020 were included in this study. Our study looked at those who received HCQ-based therapy along with supportive care (SC) and compared them to patients who received SC alone. The primary outcome was hospital admission within 28-days of presentation. The secondary outcome was a composite of intensive care admission (ICU) and/or mortality during the follow-up period. Outcome data were assessed through a follow-up telephonic questionnaire at day 28 and were further verified with national hospitalisation and mortality registries. Multiple logistic regression model was used to control for prespecified confounders. RESULTS: Of the 7,892 symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who visited the ambulatory fever clinics during the study period, 5,541 had verified clinical outcomes at day 28 (1,817 patients in the HCQ group vs 3,724 in the SC group). At baseline, patients who received HCQ therapy were more likely to be males who did not have hypertension or chronic lung disease compared to the SC group. No major differences were noted regarding other comorbid conditions. All patients were presenting with active complaints; however, the HCQ groups had higher rates of symptoms compared to the SC group (fever: 84% vs 66.3, headache: 49.8 vs 37.4, cough: 44.5 vs 35.6, respectively). Early HCQ-based therapy was associated with a lower hospital admission within 28-days compared to SC alone (9.4% compared to 16.6%, RRR 43%, p-value <0.001). The composite outcome of ICU admission and/or mortality at 28-days was also lower in the HCQ group compared to the SC (1.2% compared to 2.6%, RRR 54%, p-value 0.001). Adjusting for age, gender, and major comorbid conditions, a multivariate logistic regression model showed a decrease in the odds of hospitalisation in patients who received HCQ compared to SC alone (adjusted OR 0.57 [95% CI 0.47-0.69], p-value <0.001). The composite outcome of ICU admission and/or mortality was also lower for the HCQ group compared to the SC group controlling for potential confounders (adjusted OR 0.55 [95% CI 0.34-0.91], p-value 0.019). CONCLUSION: Early intervention with HCQ-based therapy in patients with mild to moderate symptoms at presentation is associated with lower adverse clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients, including hospital admissions, ICU admission, and/or death.","Sulaiman, T.; Mohana, A.; Alawdah, L.; Mahmoud, N.; Hassanein, M.; Wani, T.; Alfaifi, A.; Alenazi, E.; Radwan, N.; Alkhalifah, N.; Elkady, E.; Alanazi, M.; Alqahtani, M.; Abdalla, K.; Yousif, Y.; Abogazalah, F.; Awwad, F.; Alabdulkareem, K.; Alghofaili, F.; Aljedai, A.; Jokhdar, H.; Alrabiah, F.",2020-09-13,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.09.09.20184143,1,Tarek Sulaiman,"King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.20184143v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.20184143v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
17600,COVID-19 Wastewater Epidemiology: A Model to Estimate Infected Populations,"BACKGROUNDWastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) provides an opportunity for near real-time, cost-effective monitoring of community level transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater can identify the presence of COVID-19 in the community, but methods are lacking for estimating the numbers of infected individuals based on wastewater RNA concentrations.

METHODSComposite wastewater samples were collected from three sewersheds and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. A Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model based on mass rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater was developed to predict the number of infected individuals. Predictions were compared to confirmed cases identified by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control for the same time period and geographic area.

RESULTSModel predictions for the relationship between mass rate of virus release to the sewersheds and numbers of infected individuals were validated based on estimated prevalence from individual testing. A simplified equation to estimate the number of infected individuals fell within the 95% confidence limits of the model. The unreported rate for COVID-19 estimated by the model was approximately 12 times that of confirmed cases. This aligned well with an independent estimate for the state of South Carolina.

CONCLUSIONSThe SEIR model provides a robust method to estimate the total number of infected individuals in a sewershed based on the mass rate of RNA copies released per day.

2553,"Mental health status among family members of health care workers in Ningbo, China during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak: a Cross-sectional Study","BackgroundSo far, the psychological impact of COVID-19 epidemic among family members of Health care workers (HCWs) in China has been neglected. The present cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the mental health status and related factors of families of HCWs in Designated Hospitals in Ningbo, China.

MethodFamily members of HCWs working in five designated hospitals in Ningbo, China were recruited between February 10th and 20th, 2020. Information on demographic variables, the COVID-19-related events in the lives, knowledge of COVID-19 and the working status of family members (that is, HCWs) was collected using online self-administered questionnaires. The mental health status were assessed using the Chinese version of Patient Health Questionnare-9 (PHQ-9) and Chinese version of Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the main factors associated with the mental health conditions.

ResultsA total of 822 participants completed questionnaires correctly. (response rate of 95.80%). The overall prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms were 33.73%, and 29.35%, respectively. More times (hours) to focus on the COVID-19 (Odd ratio (OR)=1.215, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.061-1.391), family members (that is, HCWs) directly contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients (OR=1.477, 95%CI:1.069-2.040) were risk factors for GAD, while higher participants self-reported safety score for protective equipment of HCWs (OR=0.807, 95%CI:0.700-0.930) was a protective factor. More times (hours) to focus on the COVID-19 (OR=1.215, 95%CI:1.061-1.391), longer average working times per week for family members (that is, HCWs) (OR=1.017, 95%CI:1.005-1.029), being parents and other next of kin of HCWs were risk factors for depressive symptoms (OR=3.526, 95%CI:1.609-7.728 and OR=1.639, 95%CI:1.096-2.451, respectively). In addition, compared with participants who were HCWs, participants who were enterprise workers and were more likely to develop depressive symptoms(OR=1.750, 95%CI:1.104-2.776), while who were government employees or institutions employees were less likely to suffer depressive symptoms (OR=0.529, 95%CI:0.286-0.977).

ConclusionsPsychological responses to COVID-19 have been dramatic among family members of HCWs during the rising phase of the outbreak. Our findings provide strong evidence to pay more attention on the mental health status of this vulnerable but often unseen populations during COVID-19 epidemic.","Ying, Y.; Kong, F.; Zhu, B.; Ji, Y.; Lou, Z.; Ruan, L.",2020-03-17,Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology,10.1101/2020.03.13.20033290,1,Liemin Ruan,"Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo Hospital of Zhejiang University, Ningbo, Zhejiang 315211, P.R.

3942,Data model to predict prevalence of COVID-19 in Pakistan,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) has spread to 181 countries and regions and leaving behind 1,133,788 confirmed cases and 62784 deaths worldwide. Countries with lower health services and facilities like Pakistan are on great risk. Pakistan so far has 3,277 confirmed cases and 50 reported deaths due to COVID19. Various mathematical models had presented to predict the global and regional size of pandemic. However, all those models have certain limitation due to their dependence on different variables and analyses are subject to potential bias. As each country has its own dimension therefore country specific model are required to develop accurate estimate. Here we present a data model to predict the size of COVID19 in Pakistan. In this mathematical data model, we used the time sequence mean weighting (TSMW) to estimate the expected future number of COVID19 cases in Pakistan until 29th April 2020. For future expected numbers of cases for long terms the data collection have to be maintained in real time.","Qasim, M.; Ahmad, W.; Zhang, S.; Yasir, M.; Azhar, M.",2020-04-10,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.06.20055244,1,Muhammad Qasim,University of Otago,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20055244v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20055244v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
5989,Battling the COVID-19 Pandemic: Is Bangladesh Prepared?,"Following detection of the first few COVID-19 cases in early March, Bangladesh has stepped up its efforts to strengthen capacity of the healthcare system to avert a crisis in the event of a surge in the number of cases. This paper sheds light on the preparedness of the healthcare system by examining the spatial distribution of isolation beds across districts and divisions, forecasting the number of ICU units that may be required in the short term and analyzing the availability of frontline healthcare workers to combat the pandemic. As of May 2, COVID-19 cases have been found in 61 of the 64 districts in Bangladesh with Dhaka District being the epicenter. Seventy-one percent of the cases have been identified in 6 neighboring districts, namely, Dhaka, Narayanganj, Gazipur, Narsingdi, Munsiganj and Kishoreganj, which appear to form a spatial cluster. However, if one takes into account the population at risk, the prevalence appears to be highest in Dhaka, followed by Narayanganj, Gazipur, Kishorganj, Narsingdi and Munshiganj. These regions may therefore be flagged as the COVID-19 hotspots in Bangladesh. Among the eight divisions, prevalence is highest in Dhaka Division followed by Mymensingh. The number of cases per million exceeds the number of available isolation beds per million in the major hotspots indicating that there is a risk of the healthcare system becoming overwhelmed should the number of cases rise. This is especially true for Dhaka Division, where the ratio of COVID-19 patients to doctors appears to be alarmingly high. My-mensingh Division also has a disproportionately small number of doctors relative to the number of COVID-19 patients. Using second order polynomial regression, the analysis predicts that even if all ICU beds are allocated to COVID-19 patients, Bangladesh may run out of ICU beds soon after May 15, 2020. We conclude that in spite of a significant increase in hospital capacity during 2005-15 and a 57 % rise in the number of doctors during the same period, the healthcare system in Bangladesh and Dhaka Division in particular, may not be fully prepared to handle the COVID-19 crisis. Thus, further steps need to be taken to flatten the curve and improve healthcare capacity.","Rahaman Khan, H.; Howlader, T.; Islam, M.

10735,Phenoflow: A Microservice Architecture for Portable Workflow-based Phenotype Definitions,"Phenotyping is an effective way to identify cohorts of patients with particular characteristics within a population. In order to enhance the portability of a phenotype definition across institutions, it is often defined abstractly, with implementers expected to realise the phenotype computationally before executing it against a dataset. However, unclear definitions, with little information about how best to implement the definition in practice, hinder this process. To address this issue, we propose a new multi-layer, workflow-based model for defining phenotypes, and a novel authoring architecture, Phenoflow, that supports the development of these structured definitions and their realisation as computable phenotypes. To evaluate our model, we determine its impact on the portability of both code-based (COVID-19) and logic-based (diabetes) definitions, in the context of key datasets, including 26,406 patients at North-western University. Our approach is shown to ensure the portability of phenotype definitions and thus contributes to the transparency of resulting studies.","Chapman, M.; Rasmussen, L. V.; Pacheco, J.

11677,Creating a safe workplace by universal testing of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and healthcare workers in the electrophysiology unit having no symptoms of COVID-19: a multi-center experience,"BackgroundAs the coronavirus cases continue to surge, the urgent need for universal testing to identify positive cases for effective containment of this highly contagious pandemic has become the center of attention worldwide. However, in spite of extensive discussions, very few places have even attempted to implement it. We evaluated the efficacy of widespread testing in creating a safe workplace in our healthcare community including staff and patients.

Furthermore, we assessed the rate of new infections in patients undergoing electrophysiology (EP) procedure, to see if identification and exclusion of positive cases facilitated establishment of a risk-free operating environment.

MethodsUniversal testing was conducted in subjects with no symptoms of COVID-19 including patients and their caregivers and staff in our electrophysiology units along with the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) staff (n=1670)

ResultsOf 1670, 758 (45.4%) were EP patients, and the remaining 912 were caregivers, EMS staff and hospital staff from EP clinic and lab. Viral-RNA test revealed 64 (3.8%) positives in the population. A significant increase in the rate of positives was observed from April to June, 2020 (p=0.02). Procedures of positive cases (n=31) were postponed until they tested negative at retesting on day 14. Staff testing positive (n=33) were retested before going back to work after 2 weeks. Because of suspected exposure, 67 staff were retested and source was traced. No new infections were reported in patients during the hospital stay or within 2-weeks after the procedure.

ConclusionUniversal testing to identify positive cases was helpful in creating and maintaining a safe working environment without exposing patients and staff to new infections in the EP unit at the hospital.

3102,Simulation-based Estimation of the Spread of COVID-19 in Iran,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 disease has turned into a global pandemic with unprecedented challenges for the global community. Understanding the state of the disease and planning for future trajectories relies heavily on data on the spread and mortality. Yet official data coming from various countries are highly unreliable: symptoms similar to common cold in majority of cases and limited screening resources and delayed testing procedures may contribute to under-estimation of the burden of disease. Anecdotal and more limited data are available, but few have systematically combined those with official statistics into a coherent view of the epidemic. This study is a modeling-in-real-time of the emerging outbreak for understanding the state of the disease. Our focus is on the case of the spread of disease in Iran, as one of the epicenters of the disease in the first months of 2020.

MethodWe develop a simple dynamic model of the epidemic to provide a more reliable picture of the state of the disease based on existing data. Building on the generic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered) framework we incorporate two behavioral and logistical considerations. First we capture the endogenous changes in contact rate (average contact per person) as more death are reported. As a result the reproduction number changes endogenously in the model. Second we differentiate reported and true cases by including simple formulations for how only a fraction of cases might be diagnosed, and how that fraction changes in response to epidemics progression. In estimating the model we use both the official data as well as the discovered infected travelers and unofficial medical community estimates and triangulate these sources to build a more complete picture. Calibration is completed by forming a likelihood function for observing the actual time series data conditional on model parameters, and conducting a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. The model is used to estimate current ""true"" cases of infection and death. We analyze the future trajectory of the disease under six conditions related to the seasonal effects and policy measures targeting social distancing.

FindingsThe model closely replicates the past data but also shows the true number of cases is likely far larger. We estimate about 493,000 current infected cases (90% CI: 271K-810K) as of March 20th, 2020. Our estimate for cumulative cases of infection until that date is 916,000 (90% CI: 508K, 1.5M), and for total death is 15,485 (90% CI: 8.4K, 25.8K). These numbers are significantly (more than one order of magnitude) higher than official statistics. The trajectory of the epidemic until the end of June could take various paths depending on the impact of seasonality and policies targeting social distancing. In the most optimistic scenario for seasonal effects, depending on policy measures, 1.6 million Iranians (90% CI: 0.9M-2.6M) are likely to get infected, and death toll will reach about 58,000 cases (90% CI: 32K-97K), while in the more pessimistic scenarios, death toll may exceed 103,000 cases (90% CI: 56K-172K).

ImplicationOur results suggest that the number of cases and deaths may be over an order of magnitude larger than official statistics in Iran. Absent extended testing capacity other countries may face a significant under-count of existing cases and thus be caught off guard about the actual toll of the epidemic.","Ghaffarzadegan, N.; Rahmandad, H.",2020-03-27,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.22.20040956,1,Navid Ghaffarzadegan,Virginia Tech,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040956v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040956v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1002/sdr.1655

Thus, there is potentially a high risk for COVID-19 within PSH, which may necessitate tenants to take protective measures. This study reports on survey results collected from 532 PSH tenants in Los Angeles, California during the 4th week of March in 2020. Results show that nearly all tenants were aware of COVID-19, and 65% considered it to be a very serious health threat. The latter characteristic was a strong predictor of taking protective measures (i.e., handwashing and social distancing). Tenants in units with shared bathroom facilities had lower odds of social distancing than those in studio apartments. Tenants with mental health diagnoses had lower odds of consistent handwashing. Lack of access to food, hygiene items, and medication delivery were commonly reported barriers to sheltering in place.","Henwood, B.

13526,The necessary cooperation between governments and public in the fight against COVID-19: why non-pharmaceutical interventions may be ineffective,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is the biggest public health challenge in the last 100 years. No successful pharmaceutical treatment is yet available, thus effective public health interventions to contain COVID-19 include social distancing, isolation and quarantine measures, however the efficiency of these containment measures varied among countries and even within states in the same country. Despite Brazil being deeply affected by coronavirus, the federal government never proposed a coordinated action to control COVID-19 and Brazilian states, which are autonomous, each imposed different containment measures. The state of Goias declared strict social distancing measures in March 13, but gradually relaxed many of its first measures due specially to public pressure. Here we use a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model combined with Bayesian inference and a time-dependent spreading rate to assess how past state-level interventions affected the spread of COVID-19 in Goias. The interventions succeeded in decreasing the transmission rate in the state, however, after the third intervention the rate remained positive and exponential. Thus, other stricter interventions were made necessary to avoid the growth of new cases and a collapse in the health system. Governmental interventions need to be taken seriously by the population in order for them have the proposed outcome. Our results reflect the populations disregard with the measures imposed and the need for cooperation between governments and its citizens in the fight against COVID-19.","Borges, C. M.; Coelho, M. T.

5782,Mental Health of Clinical Staff Working in High-Risk Epidemic and Pandemic Health Emergencies: A Rapid Review of the Evidence and Meta-Analysis,"The global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 has raised concerns about the potential mental health impact on frontline clinical staff. However, given that poor mental health is common in staff working in acute medicine, we aimed to estimate the additional burden of working directly with infected patients during epidemic and pandemic health emergencies. We completed a rapid review of the evidence and identified 74 relevant studies from outbreaks of COVID-19, Ebola, H1N1 influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Due to varying caseness criteria, a meta-analysis of prevalence was not possible. However, it was clear that levels of self-reported depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related symptoms were high, and somewhat higher in clinical staff working in high exposure roles. To assess the impact of high- versus low-exposure healthcare work more formally, we estimated the standardised mean difference (SMD) of scale means using a random effects meta-analysis. High exposure work was associated with only a small additional burden of acute mental health problems compared to low exposure work (anxiety: SMD=0.22, 95% CI 0.06 - 0.38; PTSD symptoms: SMD=0.21, 95% CI 0.01 - 0.4; depression: SMD=0.20, -0.07 - 0.47). This effect was potentially inflated by publication bias and there was a moderate risk of bias in the studies in the meta-analysis. A narrative review of candidate risk factors identified being a nurse, seeing colleagues infected, experiencing quarantine, non-voluntary role assignment, and experiencing stigma, as associated with particularly poor mental health outcomes. Protective factors included team and institutional support, use and faith in infection prevention measures, and a sense of professional duty and altruistic acceptance of risk. Notably, formal psychological support services were valued by frontline staff, although those with the highest burden of mental health difficulties were the least likely to request or receive support.","Bell, V.; Wade, D.",2020-05-02,Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology,10.1101/2020.04.28.20082669,1,Vaughan Bell,UCL,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20082669v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20082669v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.1007/s00127-020-01990-x

It provides results after a 10 minutes exposure to 5 {micro}L of unprocessed samples, maintains high specificity and single-molecule sensitivity in human saliva or serum, and is rapidly reprogrammed towards any protein target for which nanobodies exist. We demonstrate the use of this highly modular platform for the detection of green fluorescent protein, SARS-CoV-1/2, and MERS-CoV spike proteins and validate the sensor for COVID-19 screening in unprocessed clinical nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples.","Guo, K.; Wustoni, S.; Koklu, A.; Diaz-Galicia, E.; Moser, M.; Hama, A.; Alqahtani, A.

11507,Asthma in COVID-19: An extra chain fitting around the neck?,"IntroductionThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across the globe, overwhelming healthcare systems and depleting resources. The infection has a wide spectrum of presentations, and pre-existing comorbidities have been found to have a dramatic effect on the disease course and prognosis. We sought to analyze the effect of asthma on the disease progression and outcomes of COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe conducted a multi-center retrospective study of positively confirmed COVID-19 patients from multiple hospitals in Louisiana. Demographics, medical history, comorbidities, clinical presentation, daily laboratory values, complications, and outcomes data were collected and analyzed. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, risk of intubation, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital stay.

ResultsA total of 502 COVID-19 patients (72 asthma and 430 non-asthma cohorts) were included in the study. The frequency of asthma in hospitalized cohorts was 14.3%, higher than the national prevalence of asthma (7.7%). Univariate analysis revealed that asthma patients were more likely to be obese (75% vs 54.2%, p=0.001), with higher frequency of intubation (40.3% vs 27.8%, p = 0.036), and required longer duration of hospitalization (15.1{+/-}12.5 vs 11.5{+/-}10.6, p=0.015). After adjustment, multivariable analysis showed that asthmatic patients were not associated with higher risk of ICU admission (OR=1.81, 95%CI=0.98-3.09, p=0.06), endotracheal intubation (OR=1.77, 95%CI=0.99-3.04, p=0.06) or complications (OR=1.37, 95%CI=0.82-2.31, p=0.23). Asthmatic patients were not associated with higher odds of prolonged hospital length of stay (OR=1.48, 95%CI=0.82-2.66, p=0.20) or with the duration of ICU stay (OR=0.76, 95%CI=0.28-2.02, p=0.58). Kaplan-Meier curve showed no significant difference in overall survival of the two groups (p=0.65).

ConclusionDespite the increased prevalence of hospitalization in asthmatic COVID-19 patients compared to the general population, after adjustment for other variables, it was neither associated with increased severity nor worse outcomes.","Hussein, M.

19782,"Seropositivity in blood donors and pregnant women during 9-months of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Stockholm, Sweden","Structured abstractO_ST_ABSObjectivesC_ST_ABSAs Sweden did not enforce social lockdown in response to the pandemic, it is critical to establish seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 in healthy, active adults - here represented by blood donors and pregnant women. Random sampling was carried out in Stockholm, the countrys most populous region, and the study ran from virus emergence (March 2020) until the end of 2020, shortly prior to the first round of vaccinations, allowing for an estimate of population seropositivity in response to natural infection.

DesignIn this cross-sectional prospective study, otherwise-healthy blood donors (n=2,100) and pregnant women (n=2,000) were sampled at random for consecutive weeks (at three intervals) between 14th March and 11th December 2020. Sera from all participants and a large cohort of historical controls (n=595) were screened for IgG responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) trimer and the receptor-binding domain (RBD). As a complement to standard approaches to analyze the data, a probabilistic Bayesian approach that assigns likelihood of past infection was used to analyze the population data. The study was carried out in accordance with Swedish Ethical Review Authority registration no. 2020-01807.

SettingHealthy participant samples were selected from their respective pools at random through the Karolinska University Hospital.

ParticipantsNone of the participants were symptomatic at the time of sampling and none had previously been hospitalized for COVID-19. No additional metadata was available from the samples.

ResultsBlood donors and pregnant women showed a similar seroprevalence. After a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased steadily in approach to the winter second-wave of infections, approaching 15% of all individuals surveyed by 11th December 2020. Importantly, 96% of antibody-positive healthy donors screened (n=56) developed neutralizing antibody responses at titers comparable to or higher than those observed in clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccination, supporting that mild infection engenders a competent B cell response.

ConclusionsIn agreement with currently rising COVID-19 cases and ICU occupancy during a second winter wave of infections, these data demonstrate that the metropolitan Stockholm area was far from herd immunity nine months after the outbreak, with approximately one-in-six persons in the examined cohort seropositive for SARS-CoV-2.

General abstractPublic health strategies to contain the pandemic continue to vary markedly across the world. In Sweden, compared to most advanced economies, social restrictions have primarily relied upon voluntary adherence to a set of recommendations and strict lockdowns have not been enforced. To better understand the development of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in the Stockholm population before the start of mass vaccinations, healthy blood donors and pregnant women (n=4,100) were sampled at random between 14th March-11th December 2020. All individuals (n=200/sampling week) were screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) trimer- and RBD-specific IgG responses with highly sensitive and specific ELISA assays, and the results were compared with those from historical controls (n=595). Data were modelled using a probabilistic Bayesian framework that considered individual responses to both antigens. We found that after a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased steadily in approach to the winter second-wave of infections, approaching 15% of all individuals surveyed by 11th December. In agreement with the high transmission rate observed in the Stockholm area, seroprevalence in this cohort of active adults increased during the 9 months from the start of the outbreak, but was far from that required for herd immunity at the end of 2020.","C Dopico, X.; Muschiol, S.; Christian, M.; Hanke, L.; Sheward, D.

3689,Therapeutic Management of COVID-19 Patients: A systematic review,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the COVID-19 that has been declared a global pandemic by the WHO in 2020. The COVID-19 treatment guidelines vary in each country, and yet there is no approved therapeutic for COVID-19.

Aims of the studythis review aimed to report any evidence of therapeutics used for the management of COVID-19 patients in clinical practice since the emergence of the virus.

MethodsA systematic review protocol was developed based on PRISMA Statement. Articles for review were selected from electronic databases (Embase, Medline and Google Scholar). Readily accessible peer-reviewed full articles in English published from December 1 st, 2019 to March 26 th, 2020 were included. The search terms included combinations of: COVID, SARS-COV-2, glucocorticoids, convalescent plasma, antiviral, antibacterial. There were no restrictions on the type of study design eligible for inclusion.

ResultsAs of March 26, 2020, of the initial manuscripts identified (n=449) articles. Forty-one studies were included, of which clinical trials (n=3), (case reports n=7), case series (n=10), retrospective (n=11) and prospective (n=10) observational studies. Thirty-six studies were conducted in China (88%).

The most common mentioned and reported medicine in this systematic review was corticosteroids (n=25), followed by Lopinavir (n=21) and oseltamivir (n=16).

ConclusionsThis is the first systematic review up to date related to the therapeutics used in COVID-19 patients. Only forty-one research articles on COVID-19 and therapeutics were found eligible to be included, most conducted in China, corticosteroid therapy was found to be the most used medicine in these studies.","Tobaiqy, M.; Qashqary, M.; Al-Dahery, S.; Mujallad, A.; Hershan, A.

7735,Effects of a DPP-4 inhibitor and RAS blockade on clinical outcomes of patients with diabetes and COVID-19,"BackgroundDipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade are reported to affect the clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, the effectiveness of these drugs in large populations is unclear.

Subjects and MethodsAs of May 2020, data analysis was conducted on all subjects who could confirm their history of claims related to COVID-19 in the National Health Review and Assessment Service database in Korea. Using the COVID-19 and claims data of the past 5 years, we compared the short-term prognosis of COVID-19 infection according to the use of DPP-4i and RAS blockade.

ResultsTotally, data of 67850 subjects were accessible. Of these, 5080 were confirmed COVID-19. Among these, 832 subjects with DM were selected for analysis in this study. Among the subjects, 263 (31.6%) and 327 (39.3%) were DPP-4i and RAS blockade users, respectively. Thirty-four subjects (4.09%) received intensive care or died. The adjusted odds ratio for severe treatment among DPP-4i users was 0.362 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.135-0.971], and that for RAS blockade users was 0.599 (95% CI, 0.251-1.431). No synergy was observed for subjects using both drugs.

ConclusionThis population-based study suggests that DPP-4i is significantly associated with a better clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19. However, the effect of RAS blockade is not significant.","Rhee, S. Y.; Lee, J.; Nam, H.; Kyoung, D.-S.; Kim, D.

17542,Characteristics of three different chemiluminescence assays for testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies,"Several tests based on chemiluminescence immunoassay techniques have become available to test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. There is currently insufficient data on serology assay performance beyond 35 days after symptoms onset. We aimed to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests on three widely used platforms. A chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA; Abbott Diagnostics, USA), a luminescence immunoassay (LIA; Diasorin, Italy), and an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA; Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) were investigated. In a multi-group study, sensitivity was assessed in a group of participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (n=145), whereas specificity was determined in two groups of participants without evidence of COVID-19 (i.e. healthy blood donors, n=191, and healthcare workers, n=1002). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, multilevel likelihood ratios (LR), and positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were characterized. Finally, analytical specificity was characterized in samples with evidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (n=9), cytomegalovirus (CMV) (n=7) and endemic common cold coronavirus infections (n=12) taken prior to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The diagnostic accuracy was comparable in all three assays (AUC 0.98). Using the manufacturers cut-offs, the sensitivities were 90%, 95% confidence interval,[84,94] (LIA), 93% [88,96] (CMIA), and 96% [91,98] (ECLIA). The specificities were 99.5% [98.9,99.8](CMIA) 99.7% [99.3,99,9] (LIA) and 99.9% [99.5,99.98] (ECLIA). The LR at half of the manufacturers cut-offs were 60 (CMIA), 82 (LIA), and 575 (ECLIA) for positive and 0.043 (CMIA) and 0.035 (LIA, ECLIA) for negative results. ECLIA had higher PPV at low pretest probabilities than CMIA and LIA. No interference with EBV or CMV infection was observed, whereas endemic coronavirus in some cases provided signals in LIA and/or CMIA. Although the diagnostic accuracy of the three investigated assays is comparable, their performance in low-prevalence settings is different. Introducing gray zones at half of the manufacturers cut-offs is suggested, especially for orthogonal testing approaches that use a second assay for confirmation.","Weber, M.; Risch, M.; Thiel, S.; Grossmann, K.; Nigg, S.; Wohlwend, N.; Lung, T.; Hillmann, D.; Ritzler, M.; Ferrara, F.; Bigler, S.; Egli, K.; Bodmer, T.; Imperiali, M.; Salimi, Y.; Fleisch, F.; Cusini, A.; Heer, S.; Renz, H.; Paprotny, M.; Kohler, P.; Vernazza, P.; Risch, L.; Kahlert, C.

6599,Bidirectional contact tracing dramatically improves COVID-19 control,"Contact tracing is critical to controlling COVID-19, but most protocols only ""forward-trace"" to notify people who were recently exposed. Using a stochastic branching-process model, we show that ""bidirectional"" tracing to identify infector individuals and their other infectees robustly improves outbreak control, reducing the effective reproduction number (Reff) by at least [~]0.3 while dramatically increasing resilience to low case ascertainment and test sensitivity. Adding smartphone-based exposure notification can further reduce Reff by 0.25, but only if nearly all smartphones can detect exposure events. Our results suggest that with or without digital approaches, implementing bidirectional tracing will enable health agencies to control COVID-19 more effectively without requiring high-cost interventions.","Bradshaw, W.

9767,Impact of weather indicators on the COVID-19 outbreak: A multi-state study in India,"The present study examines the impact of weather indicators on the COVID-19 outbreak in the majorly affected states of India. In this study, we hypothesize that the weather indicators could significantly influence the impact of the corona virus. The Kendall and Spearman rank correlation tests were chosen to conduct the statistical analysis. In this regard, we compiled a daily dataset including confirmed case counts, Recovered case counts, Deceased cases, Average Temperature, Maximum Relative Humidity, Maximum Wind Speed for six most affected states of India during the period of March 25, 2020 to April 24, 2020. We investigated that the average Humidity and Average Temperature seven days ago play a significant role in the recovery of coronavirus cases. The rise in average temperature will improve the recovery rate in the days to come. The cities with very high humidity levels or dry weather conditions have high probabilities of recovery from COVID-19. The findings of this research will help the policymakers to identify risky geographic areas and enforce timely preventive measures.","Singh, K.; Agarwal, A.",2020-06-16,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.06.14.20130666,1,Kuldeep Singh,Malaviya National Institute of Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.14.20130666v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.14.20130666v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
19444,COVID19 is a seasonal climate-driven disease across both hemispheres,"The role of climate in the population dynamics of COVID-19 remains poorly understood, and a true seasonal signature has remained elusive. Data from both hemispheres and the second wave provide opportunities to further examine climatic drivers. With a statistical method designed to detect transitory associations, we show consistent negative effects of temperature and absolute humidity at large spatial scales. At finer spatial resolutions we substantiate these connections during the seasonal rise and fall of COVID-19. Strong disease responses are identified between 12-18{degrees}C for Temperature and 4-12 g/m3 for Absolute Humidity. These results classify COVID-19 as a seasonal low-temperature infection, and point to the airborne pathway as an important contribution to transmission for SARS-CoV-2, with implications for control measures we discuss.","Fontal, A.; Bouma, M.

7718,Hospital admissions in inflammatory rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic: incidence and role of disease modifying agents,"BackgroundIn this pandemic, it is essential for rheumatologist and patients to know the relationship between COVID-19 and inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD). We want to assess the role of targeted synthetic or biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (ts/bDMARDs) and other variables in the development of moderate-severe COVID-19 disease in IRD.

MethodsAn observational longitudinal study was conducted (1stMar to 15thApr 2020). All patients from the rheumatology outpatient clinic from a hospital in Madrid with a medical diagnosis of IRD were included. Main outcome: hospital admission related to COVID-19. Independent variable: ts/bDMARDs. Covariates: sociodemographic, comorbidities, type of IRD diagnosis, glucocorticoids, NSAIDs and conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs). Incidence rate (IR) of hospital admission related to COVID-19, was expressed per 1,000 patients-month. Cox multivariate regression analysis was run to examine the influence of ts/bDMARDs and other covariates on IR.

Results3,591 IRD patients were included (5,896 patients-month). Concerning csDMARDs, methotrexate was the most used followed by antimalarial. 802 patients were on ts/bDMARDs, mainly anti-TNF agents, and rituximab. Hospital admissions related to COVID-19 occurred in 54 patients (1.36%) with an IR of 9.15 [95%CI: 7-11.9]. In the multivariate analysis, older, male gender, presence of comorbidities and specific systemic autoimmune conditions (Sjoegren, polychondritis, Raynaud and mixed connective tissue disease) had more risk of hospital admissions regardless other factors. Exposition to ts/bDMARDs did not achieve statistical signification. Use of glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, and csDMARDs dropped from the final model.

ConclusionThis study provides additional evidence in IRD patients regarding susceptibility to moderate-severe infection related to COVID-19.","Fernandez-Gutierrez, B.; Leon, L.; Madrid, A.; Rodriguez-Rodriguez, L.; Freites, D.; Font, J.; Mucientes, A.; Colomer, J.

17579,"Multiplexed, quantitative serological profiling of COVID-19 from a drop of blood by a point-of-care test","Highly sensitive, specific, and point-of-care (POC) serological assays are an essential tool to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we report on a microfluidic, multiplexed POC test that can profile the antibody response against multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens--Spike S1 (S1), Nucleocapsid (N), and the receptor binding domain (RBD)--simultaneously from a 60 {micro}L drop of blood, plasma, or serum. We assessed the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in plasma samples from 19 individuals (at multiple time points) with COVID-19 that required admission to the intensive care unit and from 10 healthy individuals. This POC assay shows good concordance with a live virus microneutralization assay, achieved high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (100%), and successfully tracked the longitudinal evolution of the antibody response in infected individuals. We also demonstrated that we can detect a chemokine, IP-10, on the same chip, which may provide prognostic insight into patient outcomes. Because our test requires minimal user intervention and is read by a handheld detector, it can be globally deployed in the fight against COVID-19 by democratizing access to laboratory quality tests.","Heggestad, J.

8599,Evolutionary trends of the COVID-19 epidemic and effectiveness of government interventions in Nigeria: A data-driven analysis.,"BackgroundNigeria became the first sub Saharan African country to record a case of COVID-19 after an imported case from Italy was confirmed on February 27, 2020. Moving averages and the Epidemic Evaluation Indices (EEI) are two important but complementary methods useful in monitoring epidemic trends, they can also serve as a useful guide for policy makers and inform the timing of decisions on preventive measures. The objectives of this paper are to graphically depict the trends of new COVID-19 cases nationally and in two key States (Lagos and Kano) and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) using the moving averages and the EEI. In addition, we examined the effects of governments public health interventions on the spread of COVID-19 and appraise the progress made so far in addressing the challenges of COVID-19 in Nigeria.

MethodsWe used data on new cases of COVID-19 from public sources released by the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) from the 27th February 2020, when the first case was recorded, to 11th May, 2020, one week after the lockdowns in Lagos and the FCT were lifted. We computed moving averages of various orders, the log transformations of the moving averages and then the EEIs of new COVID-19 cases for Nigeria as a whole, and then for two of the most affected states i.e. Lagos and Kano, as well as the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Then, we plotted graphs to depict these indices and show the epidemic trends for COVID-19 in each scenario.

ResultsNationally, the number of new cases of COVID-19 showed an initial gradual rise from the first reported case on the 27th February 2020. However, by the second week in April, these numbers began to show a relatively sharper increase and this trend has continued till date. Similar trends were observed in Lagos state and the FCT. The rate of growth of the logarithm-transformed moving average in the period leading to, and including the lockdowns reduced by a factor of 0.65. This suggests that the policies put in place by the government including the lockdown measures in Lagos and the FCT may have had a positive effect on the development of new cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Nationally and in Lagos, the EEIs of the COVID-19 cases started off on very high notes, however, the effects of the lockdown gradually became evident by the end of April and early May 2020, as the EEIs headed closer to 1.0. In all case scenarios, the EEIs are still above 1.0.

Conclusions and recommendationsThe number of new cases of COVID-19 has been on a steady rise since the first reported case. In Nigeria especially across the two states and the FCT, public health interventions including the lockdown measures appear to have played a role in reducing the rate of increase of new infections. The EEIs are still above 1.0, suggesting that despite the progress that appears to have been made, the epidemic is still evolving and Nigeria has not yet reached her peak for COVID-19 cases. We recommend that aggressive public health interventions and restrictions against mass gatherings should be sustained.","Odukoya, O. O.; Adeleke, I. A.; Jim, C. S.; Isikekpei, B. C.; Obiodunukwe, C.

5727,Diagnosing COVID-19 infection: the danger of over-reliance on positive test results,"Unlike previous epidemics, in addressing COVID-19 nearly all international health organizations and national health ministries have treated a single positive result from a PCR-based test as confirmation of infection, even in asymptomatic persons without any history of exposure. This is based on a widespread belief that positive results in these tests are highly reliable. However, data on PCR-based tests for similar viruses show that PCR-based testing produces enough false positive results to make positive results highly unreliable over a broad range of real-world scenarios. This has clinical and case management implications, and affects an array of epidemiological statistics, including the asymptomatic ratio, prevalence, and hospitalization and death rates. Steps should be taken to raise awareness of false positives, reduce their frequency, and mitigate their effects. In the interim, positive results in asymptomatic individuals that havent been confirmed by a second test should be considered suspect.

Key messagesThe high specificities (usually 100%) reported in PCR-based tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection do not represent the real-world use of these tests, where contamination and human error produce significant rates of false positives.

Widespread misunderstanding of these false positive rates affects an array of clinical, case management and health policy decisions. Similarly, health authorities guidance on interpreting test results is often wrong.

Steps should be taken immediately to reduce the frequency and impacts of false positive results.","Cohen, A. N.; Kessel, B.; Milgroom, M.

2172,The spatiotemporal estimation of the dynamic risk and the international transmission of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: A global perspective,"An ongoing novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia infection outbreak called COVID-19 started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. It both spread rapidly to all provinces in China and started spreading around the world quickly through international human movement from January 2020. Currently, the spatiotemporal epidemic transmission patterns, prediction models, and possible risk analysis for the future are insufficient for COVID-19 but we urgently need relevant information, particularly from the global perspective.

We have developed a novel two-stage simulation model to simulate the spatiotemporal changes in the number of COVID-19 cases and estimate the future worldwide risk. Based on the connectivity of countries to China and the countrys medical and epidemic prevention capabilities, different scenarios are generated to analyze the possible transmission throughout the world and use this information to evaluate each countrys vulnerability to and the dynamic risk of COVID-19.

Countries vulnerability to the COVID-19 outbreak from China is calculated for 63 countries around the world. Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Japan are the most vulnerable areas. The relationship between each countrys vulnerability and days before the first imported case occurred shows a very high exponential decrease. The cumulative number of cases in each country also has a linear relationship with vulnerability, which can compare and quantify the initial epidemic prevention capabilities to various countries management strategies. In total, 1,000 simulation results of future cases around the world are generated for the spatiotemporal risk assessment. According to the simulation results of this study, if there is no specific medicine for it, it will likely form a global pandemic. This method can be used as a preliminary risk assessment of the spatiotemporal spread for a new global epidemic. * Note: This study was completed on February 15, 2020.","Lin, Y.-C.; Chi, W.-J.; Lin, Y.-T.; Lai, C.-Y.",2020-03-03,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.02.29.20029413,1,Yuan-Chien Lin,"Department of Civil Engineering, National Central University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029413v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029413v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

6148,Dose prediction for repurposing nitazoxanide in SARS-CoV-2 treatment or chemoprophylaxis,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organisation and urgent treatment and prevention strategies are needed. Many clinical trials have been initiated with existing medications, but assessments of the expected plasma and lung exposures at the selected doses have not featured in the prioritisation process. Although no antiviral data is currently available for the major phenolic circulating metabolite of nitazoxanide (known as tizoxanide), the parent ester drug has been shown to exhibit in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Nitazoxanide is an anthelmintic drug and its metabolite tizoxanide has been described to have broad antiviral activity against influenza and other coronaviruses. The present study used physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling to inform optimal doses of nitazoxanide capable of maintaining plasma and lung tizoxanide exposures above the reported nitazoxanide 90% effective concentration (EC90) against SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsA whole-body PBPK model was constructed for oral administration of nitazoxanide and validated against available tizoxanide pharmacokinetic data for healthy individuals receiving single doses between 500 mg - 4000 mg with and without food. Additional validation against multiple-dose pharmacokinetic data when given with food was conducted. The validated model was then used to predict alternative doses expected to maintain tizoxanide plasma and lung concentrations over the reported nitazoxanide EC90 in >90% of the simulated population. Optimal design software PopDes was used to estimate an optimal sparse sampling strategy for future clinical trials.

ResultsThe PBPK model was validated with AAFE values between 1.01 - 1.58 and a difference less than 2-fold between observed and simulated values for all the reported clinical doses. The model predicted optimal doses of 1200 mg QID, 1600 mg TID, 2900 mg BID in the fasted state and 700 mg QID, 900 mg TID and 1400 mg BID when given with food, to provide tizoxanide plasma and lung concentrations over the reported in vitro EC90 of nitazoxanide against SARS-CoV-2. For BID regimens an optimal sparse sampling strategy of 0.25, 1, 3 and 12h post dose was estimated.

ConclusionThe PBPK model predicted that it was possible to achieve plasma and lung tizoxanide concentrations, using proven safe doses of nitazoxanide, that exceed the EC90 for SARS-CoV-2. The PBPK model describing tizoxanide plasma pharmacokinetics after oral administration of nitazoxanide was successfully validated against clinical data. This dose prediction assumes that the tizoxanide metabolite has activity against SARS-CoV-2 similar to that reported for nitazoxanide, as has been reported for other viruses. The model and the reported dosing strategies provide a rational basis for the design (optimising plasma and lung exposures) of future clinical trials of nitazoxanide in the treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Rajoli, R.

19833,Unraveling COVID-19-related hospital costs: The impact of clinical and demographic conditions,"IntroductionAlthough patients clinical conditions were previously shown to be associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and outcomes, their impact on hospital costs is not known. The economic evaluation of COVID-19 admissions allows the assessment of hospital costs associated with the treatment of these patients, including the main cost components and costs driven by demographic and clinical conditions. The aim of this study was to determine the COVID-19 hospitalization-related costs and their association with clinical conditions.

MethodsProspective observational cohort study of the hospitalization costs of patients with COVID-19 admitted between March 30 and June 30, 2020, who were followed until discharge, death, or external transfer, using micro-costing methodology. The study was carried out in the Central Institute of the Hospital das Clinicas, affiliated with the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, which is the largest hospital complex in Latin America and was designated to exclusively admit COVID-19 patients during the pandemic response.

ResultsThe average cost of the 3,254 admissions (51.7% of which involved intensive care unit (ICU) stays) was US$12,637.42. Overhead cost was the main cost component, followed by daily fixed costs and drugs. Sex, age and underlying hypertension (US$14,746.77), diabetes (US$15,002.12), obesity (US$18,941.55), cancer (US$10,315.06), chronic renal failure (US$15,377.84), and rheumatic (US$17,764.61), hematologic (US$15,908.25) and neurologic diseases (US$15,257.95) were significantly associated with higher costs. Age >69 years, RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19, comorbidities, the use of mechanical ventilation, dialysis, or surgery, and poor outcomes remained significantly associated with higher costs after model adjustment.

ConclusionKnowledge of COVID-19-associated hospital costs and their impact across different populations can aid in the development of a generalizable and comprehensive approach to hospital preparedness, decision-making and planning for future risk management. Determining the disease-associated costs is the first step in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of treatments and vaccination programs.

SUMMARY BOXO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the COVID-19 hospitalization-related costs?

FindingsIn this prospective cohort that was carried out in a single reference quaternary center designated for the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19, more than three thousand patients were included, and their costs of hospitalization were found to be directly related to the age and comorbidities. The costs were more than 50% higher in older patients, 10-24% higher in patients with comorbidities, and 24-200% higher when additional therapeutic procedures were required.

MeaningDetermining the disease-associated costs is the first step in conducting future evaluations of the cost-effectiveness of treatments and vaccination programs, supporting their implementation with a comprehensive population-based approach.","Anna Miethke-Morais, A.; Cassenote, A.; Piva, H.; Tokunaga, E.; Cobello, V.; Alves, F.

8653,Low levels of the prognostic biomarker suPAR are predictive of mild outcome in patients with symptoms of COVID-19 - a prospective cohort study,"OBJECTIVETo examine if baseline soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) can predict whether patients with COVID-19 symptoms will need mechanical ventilation during a 14-day follow-up. Furthermore, to examine differences in demographics, clinical signs, and biomarkers in patients tested either positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2.

DESIGNProspective cohort study including patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19.

SETTINGCopenhagen University Hospital Amager and Hvidovre, Hvidovre, Denmark.

PARTICIPANTS407 patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19 were included from the Emergency Department (ED). Patients were included from March 19 to April 3 and follow-up data was collected until April 17, 2020.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESPrimary outcomes were respiratory failure in patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19 and in those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, respectively. Furthermore, we analysed differences between patients testing positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2, and disease severity outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients according to baseline suPAR.

BACKGROUNDPatients admitted to ED with clinical signs or symptoms of COVID-19 infection need a safe and quick triage, in order to determine if an in-hospital stay is necessary or if the patient can safely be isolated in their own home with relevant precautions. suPAR is a biomarker previously shown to be associated with adverse outcomes in acute medical patients. We aimed to examine if suPAR at baseline presentation is predictive of respiratory failure in patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19. Furthermore, we examined demographic, clinical, and biochemical differences between SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative patients.

RESULTSAmong the 407 symptomatic patients, the median (interquartile range) age was 64 years (47-77), 58% were women, and median suPAR was 4.2 ng/ml (2.7-6.4). suPAR level below 4.75 ng/ml at admission ruled out respiratory failure during follow-up with an area under the curve (95% CI) of 0.89 (0.85-0.94) and a negative predictive value of 99.5%. Of the 407 symptomatic patients, 117 (28.8%) had a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 and presented with significant differences in vital signs, cell counts, and biomarkers compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. In SARS-CoV-2 positive patients eligible for mechanical ventilation (N=87), 26 (30%) developed respiratory failure. Best baseline predictors of respiratory failure were suPAR with an area under the curve (95% CI) of 0.88 (0.80-0.95), EWS 0.84 (0.75-0.93), lactate dehydrogenase 0.82 (0.71-0.93), and C-reactive protein 0.80 (0.70-0.89).

CONCLUSIONSARS-CoV-2 affects several patient parameters underpinning the severe impact of the infection. A low suPAR level (<4.75 ng/ml) at baseline is a useful biomarker for aiding clinical decisions including discharge of patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19.","Eugen-Olsen, J.; Altintas, I.; Tingleff, J.; Stauning, M.; Gamst-Jensen, H.; Lindstroem, M.

20417,COVID-19: Rapid Antigen detection for SARS-CoV-2 by lateral flow assay: a national systematic evaluation for mass-testing,"Lateral flow device (LFD) viral antigen immunoassays have been developed around the world as diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection. They have been proposed to deliver an infrastructure-light, cost-economical solution giving results within half an hour. Here we report on standardised laboratory evaluations of LFDs, and for those that met the published criteria, field testing in the Falcon-C19 research study and UK pilots (UK COVID-19 testing centres, hospital, schools, armed forces). 4/64 LFDs so far have desirable performance characteristics (Orient Gene, Deepblue, Abbott and Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test). All these LFDs have a viral antigen detection of >90% at 100,000 RNA copies/ml. 8951 Innova LFD tests were performed with a kit failure rate of 5.6% (502/8951, 95% CI: 5.1-6.1), false positive rate of 0.32% (22/6954, 95% CI: 0.20-0.48). Viral antigen detection/sensitivity across the sampling cohort when performed by laboratory scientists (156/198, 95% CI 72.4-84.3) was 78.8%. Our results suggest LFDs have promising performance characteristics for mass population testing and can be used to identify infectious positive individuals. The Innova LFD shows good viral antigen detection/sensitivity with excellent specificity, although kit failure rates and the impact of training are potential issues. These results support the expanded evaluation of LFDs, and assessment of greater access to testing on COVID-19 transmission.

15476,Review of clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of COVID-19 in children-Systematic review and Meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of various clinical symptoms and laboratory findings of COVID-19 in children. METHODS: PubMed, MEDLINE, and SCOPUS databases were searched to include studies conducted between January 1, 2020, and July 15, 2020 which reported data about clinical characteristics and laboratory findings in laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 in pediatric patients. Random effects meta-analysis using generalized linear mixed models was used to estimate the pooled prevalence. RESULTS: The most prevalent symptom of COVID-19 in children was 46.17% (95%CI 39.18-53.33%), followed by cough (40.15%, 95%CI 34.56-46.02%). Less common symptoms were found to be dyspnea, vomiting, nasal congestion/rhinorrhea, diarrhea, sore throat/pharyngeal congestion, headache, and fatigue. The prevalence of asymptomatic children was 17.19% (95%CI 11.02-25.82%). The most prevalent laboratory findings in COVID-19 children were elevated Creatinine Kinase (26.86%, 95%CI 16.15-41.19%) and neutropenia (25.76%, 95%CI 13.96-42.58%). These were followed by elevated LDH, thrombocytosis, lymphocytosis, neutrophilia, elevated D Dimer, Elevated CRP, elevated ESR, leukocytosis, elevated AST and leukopenia. There was a low prevalence of elevated ALT and lymphopenia in children with COVID- 19.

13524,Aeromedical retrieval diagnostic trends during a period of Coronavirus 2019 lockdown,"BackgroundWe aimed to compare the pre, lockdown, and post-lockdown aeromedical retrieval (AR) diagnostic reasons and patient demographics during a period of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) social isolation.

MethodsAn observational study with retrospective data collection, consisting of Australians who received an AR between 26 January and 23 June 2020. The main outcome measures were patient diagnostic category proportions and trends prior (28 January to 15 March), during (16 March to 4May), and following (5 May to 23 June 2020) social isolation restrictions.

ResultsThere were 16981 ARs consisting of 1959 (11.5) primary evacuations (PEs) and 12724 (88.5) inter-hospital transfers (IHTs), with a population median age of 52 years (interquartile range [IQR] 29.0-69.0), with 49.0% (n = 8283) of the cohort being male and 38.0% (n = 6399) being female. There were a total of six confirmed and 209 suspected cases of COVID-19, with the majority of cases (n = 114; 53.0%) in the social isolation period. As compared to pre-restriction, the odds of retrieval for the restriction and post-restriction period differed across time between the major diagnostic groups. This included, an increase in cardiovascular retrieval for both restriction and post-restriction periods(OR 1.12 95% CI 1.02-1.24 and OR 1.18 95% CI 1.08-1.30 respectively), increases in neoplasm in the post restriction period (OR 1.31 95% CI 1.04-1.64), and increases for congenital conditions in the restriction period (OR 2.56 95% CI 1.39-4.71). Cardiovascular and congenital conditions had increased rates of priority 1 patients in the restriction and post restriction periods. There was a decrease in endocrine and metabolic disease retrievals in the restriction period (OR 0.72 95% CI 0.53-0.98). There were lower odds during the post-restriction period for a retrievals of the respiratory system (OR 0.78 95% CI 0.67-0.93), and disease of the skin (OR 0.78 95% CI 0.6-1.0). Distribution between the 2019 and 2020 time periods differed (p< 0.05), with the lockdown period resulting in a significant reduction in activity.

ConclusionThe lockdown period resulted in increased AR rates of circulatory and congenital conditions. However, this period also resulted in a reduction of overall activity, possibly due to a reduction in other infectious disease rates, such as influenza, due to social distancing.

O_TEXTBOXWhat is already known on this subjectWe know the rates of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) have an impact on a range of health services globally, however we do not have a clear understanding of the aeromedical retrieval reasons during a period of sustained social isolation.

What this study addsWhile there were fewer aeromedical retrievals during the social isolation period there were relatively more retrievals for cardiovascular disease and congenital malformations of the circulatory system. However, post-restriction demonstrated reductions in respiratory disease and skin infections, as compared to the pre-restriction period. Many aeromedical retrievals come from areas with higher chronic disease rates. If these areas have community transmission of COVID-19, it is likely that retrievals will increase for severe COVID-19 patients, with associated comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease.

Methods37 cases diagnosed adult COVID-19 cases of general characteristics, history of epidemiology, chronic underlying diseases, clinical symptoms and complications, chest CT, biochemical monitoring, severity assessment, treatment and outcome were retrospectively analyzed, and according to the duration from onset to release from quarantine were divided into [&le;]20 -day group and > 20 -day group, compare the similarities and differences between the two groups.

ResultsAmong the 37 patients, 5 were mild, 30 were moderate, 1 was severe and 1 was critical. All the patients were released from quarantine without death. The average duration from onset to release from quarantine was 20.2{+/-}6.6 days, The average length of stay from onset to hospitalization was 4.1{+/-}3.7 days, and hospitalization duration average 16.1 {+/-}6.2 days. The average age was 44.3{+/-}1.67 years. 78.4% of cases were caused by exposure to a confirmed patient or the workplace of a confirmed patient. The main symptoms were cough (67.6%), fever (62.2%), shortness of breath (32.4%), fatigue (24.3%), sore throat (21.6%,) vomiting or diarrhea (21.6%). The white blood cell count was decreased in 27.0% of the patients, and the lymphocyte count was decreased in 62.2% of the patients, of which 43.5% patients were [&le;]0.6x109/L. On admission, 86.5% of patients with chest CT showed pneumonia, including some asymptomatic patients. 68.8% of patients showed bilateral infiltration. In the > 20-day group, the average age was 49.9{+/-}1.38 years old, and the duration from onset to hospitalization was 5.5{+/-}3.9 days.

15980,Communicating personalised risks from COVID-19: guidelines from an empirical study,"As increasing amounts of data accumulate on the effects of the novel coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 and the risk factors that lead to poor outcomes, it is possible to produce personalised estimates of the risks faced by groups of people with different characteristics. The challenge of how to communicate these then becomes apparent. Based on empirical work (total n=5,520, UK) supported by in-person interviews with public and physicians, we make recommendations on the presentation of such information. These include: using predominantly percentages when communicating the absolute risk, but also providing (for balance) a format which conveys a higher perception of risk (expected frequency out of 10,000); using a visual linear scale cut at an appropriate point to illustrate the maximum risk, explained through an illustrative  persona who might face that highest level of risk; and providing context to the absolute risk through presenting a range of other  personas illustrating people who would face risks of a wide range of different levels. These  personas should have their major risk factors (age, existing health conditions) described. By contrast, giving people absolute likelihoods of other risks they face in an attempt to add context was considered less helpful.","Freeman, A. L.; Kerr, J.; Recchia, G.; Schneider, C.; Lawrence, A.

2043,COVID-19 in Wuhan: Immediate Psychological Impact on 5062 Health Workers,"BACKGROUNDThe outbreak of COVID-19 has laid unprecedented psychological stress on health workers (HWs). We aimed to assess the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.

METHODSWe conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the effect of psychological protective measures taken by Tongji Hospital. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of acute stress, depression, and anxiety.

RESULTSWe received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1 percent). 1509 (29.8 percent), 681 (13.5 percent) and 1218 (24.1 percent) HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Women (hazard ratio[HR], 1.31; P=0.032), years of working> 10 years (HR, 2.02; P<0.001), concomitant chronic diseases (HR, 1.51; P<0.001), history of mental disorders (HR, 3.27; P<0.001), and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected (HR, 1.23; P=0.030) were risk factors for stress, whereas care provided by hospital and department administrators(odds ratio [OR], 0.76; P=0.024) and full coverage of all departments with protective measures (OR, 0.69; P=0.004) were protective factors.

CONCLUSIONSWomen and those who have more than 10 years of working, concomitant chronic diseases, history of mental disorders, and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected are susceptible to stress, depression and anxiety among HWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological protective measures implemented by the hospital could be helpful.","Zhu, Z.; Xu, S.; Wang, H.; Liu, Z.; Wu, J.; Li, G.; Miao, J.; Zhang, C.; Yang, Y.; Sun, W.; Zhu, S.; Fan, Y.; Hu, J.; Liu, J.; Wang, W.",2020-03-16,Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology,10.1101/2020.02.20.20025338,2,Wei Wang,"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025338v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025338v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100443
5215,Lack of association between genetic variants at ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection and human quantitative phenotypes,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shows a wide variation in expression and severity of symptoms, from very mild or no symptomes, to flu-like symptoms, and in more severe cases, to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and even death. Large differences in outcome have also been observed between males and females. The causes for this variability are likely to be multifactorial, and to include genetics. The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the infection uses the human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell invasion, and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. Genetic variation in these two genes may thus modulate an individuals genetic predisposition to infection and virus clearance. While genetic data on COVID-19 patients is being gathered, we carried out a phenome-wide association scan (PheWAS) to investigate the role of these genes in other human phenotypes in the general population. We examined 178 quantitative phenotypes including cytokines and cardio-metabolic biomarkers, as well as 58 medications in 36,339 volunteers from the Lifelines population biobank, in relation to 1,273 genetic variants located in or near ACE2 and TMPRSS2. While none reached our threshold for significance, we observed a suggestive association of polymorphisms within the ACE2 gene with (1) the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) combination therapies (p=5.7x10-4), an association that is significantly stronger in females (pdiff=0.01), and (2) with the use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products (p=5.5x10-4). While these associations need to be confirmed in larger sample sizes, they suggest that these variants play a role in diseases such as hypertension and chronic inflammation that are often observed in the more severe COVID-19 cases. Further investigation of these genetic variants in the context of COVID-19 is thus promising for better understanding of disease variability.

MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted, with self-reported data of students from fourteen Cuban Universities of Medical Sciences (n = 200), through an online survey. The EEP-10-C was used as an instrument to identify stress. Its validity was determined through a confirmatory factor analysis and its internal consistency and reliability was measured by the Cronbach alph. A cluster analysis was performed to establish as cut-off point the center of the cluster with the highest values of stress perceived by the scale.

ResultsThe average age of the sample was 23.30 {+/-} 1.91 years, with observed scores of the EEP-10-C between 0 and 29 points (13.25 {+/-} 5,404). When applying the cut-off point [&ge;]25, only two students had high rates of stress perceived. The confirmatory factor analysis supported the validity of the instrument; with a Cronbachs alpha of 0.755. The cutoff point [&ge;]20 was proposed as a reference of high stress perceived for the study population, when applying this one, 14% of students presented high rates of stress.

DiscussionIn Cuba, students of the medical sciences have participated in research and supporting health care, despite which they have presented low levels of stress. The main contribution of the research was the validation of the EEP-10-C for its use in assessing levels of stress in Cuban medical students, proposing the cut-off point [&ge;]20 as a reference of high stress perceived.","Hernandez-Garcia, F.; Gongora-Gomez, O.; Gonzalez-Velazquez, V.

4381,"Incidence, clinical outcomes, and transmission dynamics of hospitalized 2019 coronavirus disease among 9,596,321 individuals residing in California and Washington, United States: a prospective cohort study","BackgroundThe United States is now the country reporting the highest number of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases and deaths. However, little is known about the epidemiology and burden of severe COVID-19 to inform planning within healthcare systems and modeling of intervention impact.

MethodsWe assessed incidence, duration of hospitalization, and clinical outcomes of acute COVID-19 inpatient admissions in a prospectively-followed cohort of 9,596,321 individuals enrolled in comprehensive, integrated healthcare delivery plans from Kaiser Permanente in California and Washington state. We also estimated the effective reproductive number (RE) describing transmission in the study populations.

ResultsData covered 1277 hospitalized patients with laboratory- or clinically-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by April 9, 2020. Cumulative incidence of first COVID-19 acute inpatient admission was 10.6-12.4 per 100,000 cohort members across the study regions. Mean censoring-adjusted duration of hospitalization was 10.7 days (2.5-97.5%iles: 0.8-30.1) among survivors and 13.7 days (2.5-97.5%iles: 1.7-34.6) among non-survivors. Among all hospitalized confirmed cases, censoring-adjusted probabilities of ICU admission and mortality were 41.9% (95% confidence interval: 34.1-51.4%) and 17.8% (14.3-22.2%), respectively, and higher among men than women. We estimated RE was 1.43 (1.17-1.73), 2.09 (1.63-2.69), and 1.47 (0.07-2.59) in Northern California, Southern California, and Washington, respectively, for infections acquired March 1, 2020. RE declined to 0.98 (0.76-1.27), 0.89 (0.74-1.06), and 0.92 (0.05-1.55) respectively, for infections acquired March 20, 2020.

ConclusionsWe identify high probability of ICU admission, long durations of stay, and considerable mortality risk among hospitalized COVID-19 cases in the western United States. Reductions in RE have occurred in conjunction with implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions.","Lewnard, J. A.; Liu, V. X.; Jackson, M. L.; Schmidt, M. A.; Jewell, B. L.; Flores, J.

9756,Impact Of Temperature and Sunshine Duration on Daily New Cases and Death due to COVID-19,"BackgroundThe coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) control has now become a critical issue for public health. Many ecological factors are proven to influence the transmission and survival of the virus. In this study, we aim to determine the association of different climate factors with the spread and mortality due to COVID-19.

MethodsThe climate indicators included in the study were duration of sunshine, average minimum temperature and average maximum temperature, with cumulative confirmed cases, deceased and recovered cases. The data was performed for 138 different countries of the world, between January 2020 to May 2020. Both univariate and multivariate was performed for cumulative and month-wise analysis using SPSS software.

ResultsThe average maximum temperature, and sunshine duration was significantly associated with COVID-19 confirmed cases, deceased and recovered. For every one degree increase in mean average temperature, the confirmed, deceased and recovered cases decreased by 2047(p=0.03), 157(p=0.016), 743 (p=0.005) individuals. The association remained significant even after adjusting for environmental such as sunshine duration as well as non-environmental variables. Average sunshine duration was inveserly correlated with increase in daily new cases ({rho}= -2261) and deaths ({rho}= -0.2985).

ConclusionHigher average temperature and longer sunshine duration was strongly associated with COVID-19 cases and deaths in 138 countries. Hence the temperature is an important factor in SARS CoV-2 survival and this study will help in formulating better preventive measures to combat COVID-19 based on their climatic conditions.","Thangriyal, S.; Rastogi, A.; Tomar, A.; Baweja, S.",2020-06-16,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.06.13.20130138,1,Sukriti Baweja,"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, New Delhi, India",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.13.20130138v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.13.20130138v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
7723,Development and clinical application of a rapid and sensitive loop-mediated isothermalamplification test for SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 outbreak urgently requires sensitive and convenient COVID-19 diagnostics for the containment and timely treatment of patients. We aimed to develop and validate a novel reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in qualified laboratories and point-of-care settings.

MethodsPatients with suspected COVID-19 and close contacts were recruited from two hospitals between Jan 26 and April 8, 2020. Respiratory samples were collected and tested using the RT-LAMP assays, and the results were compared with those obtained by RT-qPCR. Samples yielding inconsistent results between these two methods were subjected to next-generation sequencing for confirmation. The RT-LAMP assay was also tested on an asymptomatic COVID-19 carrier and patients with other respiratory viral infections.

ResultsSamples were collected from a cohort of 129 cases (329 nasopharyngeal swabs) and an independent cohort of 76 patients (152 nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples). The RT-LAMP assay was validated to be accurate (overall sensitivity and specificity: 88.89% and 99.00%; positive and negative predictive values: 94.74% and 97.78%, respectively) and diagnostically useful (positive and negative likelihood ratios: 88.89 and 0.11, respectively). RT-LAMP showed an increased sensitivity (88.89% vs 81.48%) and high consistency (kappa 0.92) compared with RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 screening while requiring only constant temperature heating and visual inspection. The time required for RT-LAMP was less than 1 h from sample preparation to result. In addition, RT-LAMP was feasible for use with asymptomatic patients and did not cross-react with other respiratory pathogens.

ConclusionThe developed RT-LAMP assay offers rapid, sensitive and straightforward detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection and could aid the expansion of COVID-19 testing in the public domain and hospitals.","Hu, X.; Deng, Q.; Li, J.; Chen, J.; Wang, Z.; Zhang, X.; Fang, Z.; Li, H.; Zhao, Y.; Yu, P.; Li, W.; Wang, X.; Li, S.; Zhang, L.; Hou, T.",2020-05-29,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.20.20108530,2,Tieying Hou,"Guangdong Provincial People\'s Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.20.20108530v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.20.20108530v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1128/mSphere.00808-20
3815,Feasibility of Controlling COVID-19 Outbreaks in the UK by Rolling Interventions,"BackgroundRecent outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led a rapid global spread around the world. For controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, many countries have implemented two non-pharmaceutical interventions: suppression like immediate lock-downs in cities at epicentre of outbreak; or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both interventions have apparent pros and cons; the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is limited. We aimed to conduct a feasibility study for robustly estimating the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, peaks and lengths of COVID-19 breakouts by taking multiple interventions in London and the UK, accounting for reduction of healthcare demand.

MethodsWe developed a model to attempt to infer the impact of mitigation, suppression and multiple rolling interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in London and the UK. Our model assumed that each intervention has equivalent effect on the reproduction number R across countries and over time; where its intensity was presented by average-number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals; early immediate intensive intervention led to increased health need and social anxiety. We considered two important features: direct link between Exposed and Recovered population, and practical healthcare demand by separation of infections into mild and critical cases. Our model was fitted and calibrated with data on cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan to estimate how suppression intervention impacted on the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths over time during January 2020, and April 2020. We combined the calibrated model with data on the cases of COVID-19 in London and non-London regions in the UK during February 2020 and March 2020 to estimate the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, and healthcare demand by using multiple interventions.

FindingsWe estimated given that multiple interventions with an intensity range from 3 to 15, one optimal strategy was to take suppression with intensity 3 in London from 23rd March for 100 days, and 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in non-London regions. In this scenario, the total infections and deaths in the UK were limited to 2.43 million and 33.8 thousand; the peak time of healthcare demand was due to the 65th day (April 11th), where it needs hospital beds for 25.3 thousand severe and critical cases. If we took a simultaneous 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in all regions of the UK, the total infections and deaths increased slightly to 2.69 million and 37 thousand; the peak time of healthcare kept the same at the 65th day, where it needs equivalent hospital beds for severe and critical cases of 25.3 thousand. But if we released high band of rolling intervention intensity to 6 or 8 and simultaneously implemented them in all regions of the UK, the COVID-19 outbreak would not end in 1 year and distribute a multi-modal mode, where the total infections and deaths in the UK possibly reached to 16.2 million and 257 thousand.

InterpretationOur results show that taking rolling intervention is probably an optimal strategy to effectively and efficiently control COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK. As large difference of population density and social distancing between London and non-London regions in the UK, it is more appropriate to implement consistent suppression in London for 100 days and rolling intervention in other regions. This strategy would potentially reduce the overall infections and deaths, and delay and reduce peak healthcare demand.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSuppression and mitigation are two common interventions for controlling infectious disease outbreaks. Previous works show rapid suppression is able to immediately reduce infections to low levels by eliminating human-to-human transmission, but needs consistent maintenance; mitigation does not interrupt transmission completely and tolerates some increase of infections, but minimises health and economic impacts of viral spread.3 While current planning in many countries is focused on implementing either suppression or mitigation, it is not clear how and when to take which level of interventions for control COVID-19 breakouts to certain country in light of balancing its healthcare demands and economic impacts.

Added value of this studyWe used a mathematical model to access the feasibility of multiple intervention to control COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK. Our model distinguished self-recovered populations, infection with mild and critical cases for estimating healthcare demand. It combined available evidence from available data source in Wuhan. We estimated how suppression, mitigation and multiple rolling interventions impact on controlling outbreaks in London and non-London regions of the UK. We provided an evidence verification point that implementing suppression in London and rolling intervention with high intensity in non-London regions is probably an optimal strategy to control COVID-19 breakouts in the UK with minimised deaths and economic impacts.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe effectiveness and impact of suppression and mitigation to control outbreaks of COVID-19 depends on intervention intensity and duration, which remain unclear at the present time. Using the current best understanding of this model, implementing consistent suppression in London for 100 days and 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in other regions potentially limit the total deaths in the UK to 33.8 thousand. Future research on how to quantify and measure intervention activities could improve precision on control estimates.","Yang, P.; Qi, J.; Zhang, S.; Bi, G.; Wang, X.; Yang, Y.; Sheng, B.; Mao, X.",2020-04-14,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.05.20054429,2,Po Yang,The University of Sheffield,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054429v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054429v2.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
11670,Reconciling model predictions with low reported cases of COVID-19 in Sub-Saharan Africa: Insights from Madagascar,"The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc globally, and there has been a particular concern for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where models suggest that the majority of the population will become infected. Conventional wisdom suggests that the continent will bear a higher burden of COVID-19 for the same reasons it suffers high burdens of other infectious diseases: ecology, socio-economic conditions, lack of water and sanitation infrastructure, and weak health systems. However, so far SSA has reported lower incidence and fatalities compared to the predictions of standard models and the experience of other regions of the world. There are three leading explanations, each with very different implications for the final epidemic burden: (1) low case detection, (2) differences in COVID-19 epidemiology (e.g. low R0), and (3) policy interventions. The low number of cases to date have led some SSA governments to relax these policy interventions. Will this result in a resurgence of cases? To understand how to interpret the lower-than-expected COVID-19 case data in Madagascar, we use a simple age-structured model to explore each of these explanations and predict the epidemic impact associated with them. We show that the current incidence of COVID-19 cases can be explained by any combination of the late introduction of first imported cases, early implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), and low case detection rates. This analysis reinforces that Madagascar, along with other countries in SSA, remains at risk of an impending health crisis. If NPIs remain enforced, up to 50,000 lives may be saved. Even with NPIs, without vaccines and new therapies, COVID-19 could infect up to 30% of the population, making it the largest public health threat in Madagascar until early 2021, hence the importance of conducting clinical trials and continually improving access to healthcare.

ResumeLa pandemie de COVID-19 a eu des consequences nefastes partout dans le monde, et il y a une preoccupation particuliere pour lAfrique subsaharienne (ASS), ou des modeles suggerent que la majorite de la population sera infectee. Il est craint que le continent supportera un fardeau plus elevee de COVID-19 pour les memes raisons quil souffre davantage dautres maladies infectieuses: ecologie, conditions socio-economiques, manque dinfrastructures deau et dassainissement, et faiblesse des systemes de sante. Cependant, jusqua present, lASS a rapporte une incidence et une mortalite bien inferieure a celle des previsions des modeles pour cette region, ainsi quau nombre observe dans dautres regions du monde. Il y a trois explications principales pour ce phenomene, chacune ayant des implications tres differentes pour le fardeau epidemique final: (1) detection faible des cas, (2) differences dans lepidemiologie COVID-19 (par exemple faible R0), et (3) interventions et politiques mises en place. Le faible nombre de cas a ce jour a conduit certains gouvernements dASS a assouplir ces interventions. Cela entrainera-t-il une resurgence de cas? Pour comprendre comment interpreter le fait que les cas COVID-19 rapportes sont plus faibles que prevu a Madagascar, nous utilisons un modele de transmission structure par groupe dage pour explorer chacune de ces explications et predire limpact epidemique qui leur est associe. Nous montrons que lincidence actuelle des cas de COVID-19 peut sexpliquer par leffet cumule de lintroduction tardive des premiers cas importes, la mise en uvre rapide dinterventions non pharmaceutiques (INP) et de faibles taux de detection des cas. Cette analyse renforce le fait que Madagascar, ainsi que dautres pays dAfrique subsaharienne, reste a risque dune crise sanitaire imminente. Si les INP restent appliques, jusqua 50 000 vies pourraient etre sauvees. Meme avec des INP, tant quil ny aura pas des vaccins ni des nouvelles therapies efficaces, COVID-19 pourrait infecter jusqua 30% de la population, ce qui constituerait la plus grande menace pour la sante publique a Madagascar jusquau debut de 2021, dou limportance de la realisation des essais cliniques et de lamelioration continuelle de lacces aux soins.

Summary BoxO_LIThe lower-than-expected number of reported cases of COVID-19 in Madagascar can be explained by a combination of the relatively late introduction of the disease, low detection rates, and low transmission rates due to the early and effective implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions that reduced contact rates.

16061,Misinformation on COVID-19 origin and its relationship with perception and knowledge about social distancing: A cross-sectional study.,"Despite the vast scientific evidence obtained from the genomic sequencing of COVID-19, a controversy regarding its origin has been created in the mass media. This could potentially have a long-term influence on the behavior among individuals, such as failure to comply with proposed social distancing measures, leading to a consequent rise in the morbidity and mortality rates from COVID-19 infection. Several studies have collected information about knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding COVID-19; however, very little is known about the relationship of the perceptions of the individuals regarding the origin of the virus with the knowledge and perception about social distancing. This study aimed at ascertaining this relationship. For such purpose, a web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample population from five provinces of the Dominican Republic within the period of June to July of 2020. The data collection instrument exploited in the study was a self-designed questionnaire distributed throughout different social media platforms. A purposive sampling strategy was implemented and a total of 1195 respondents completed the questionnaire. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS. Descriptive statistics, stepwise multiple linear regression and one-way multivariate analysis were implemented to test the hypotheses. The level of education was significantly associated (P = 0.017) with individuals perception about the origin of COVID-19, whilst only age (P = 0.032) and education level (P < 0.001) statistically significantly predicted  knowledge about social distancing. Perception of COVID-19 origin was statistically significant associated (P = < 0.001) with the measures of the dependent variables (knowledge and perception on social distancing). The present study has established a possible link between the  perception of COVID-19 origin and  the perception and knowledge about social distancing.","Reyes, L.

3465,Clinical Manifestations of Children with COVID-19: a Systematic Review,"ContextThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is an unprecedented global public health challenge, leading to thousands of deaths every day worldwide. Despite the epidemiological importance, clinical patterns of children with COVID-19 remain unclear.

ObjectiveTo describe the clinical, laboratorial and radiological characteristics of children with COVID-19.

Data SourcesThe Medline database was searched between December 1st 2019 and March 30th 2020.

Study SelectionInclusion criteria were: (1) studied patients younger than 18 years old; presented original data from cases of COVID-19 confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction; and (3) contained descriptions of clinical manifestations, laboratory tests or radiological examinations.

Data ExtractionNumber of cases, gender, age, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, radiological examinations and outcomes.

ResultsA total of 34 studies (1,118 cases) were included. From all the cases, 1,111 had their severity classified: 14.3% were asymptomatic, 36.4% were mild, 46.0% were moderate, 2.2% were severe and 1.2% were critical. The most prevalent symptom was fever (16.3%), followed by cough (14.4%), nasal symptoms (3.6%), diarrhea (2.7%) and nausea/vomiting (2.5%). One hundred forty-five (12.9%) children were diagnosed with pneumonia and 43 (3.8%) upper airway infections were reported. Reduced lymphocyte count were reported in 13.1% of cases. Abnormalities on computed tomography were reported in 62.7% of cases. The most prevalent abnormalities reported were ground glass opacities, patchy shadows and consolidations. Only one death was reported.

ConclusionsClinical manifestations of children with COVID-19 differ widely from adults cases. Fever and respiratory symptoms should not be considered a hallmark of COVID-19 in children.","De Souza, T. H.; Nadal, J. A.; Nogueira, R. J. N.; Pereira, R. M.; Brandao, M.

9710,Prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan -implications for the ability to produce long-lasting protective antibodies against SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundIt is to be determined whether people infected with SARS-CoV-2 will develop long-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and retain long-lasting protective antibodies after the infection is resolved. This study was to explore to explore the outcomes of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in four groups of individuals in Wuhan, China.

MethodsWe included the following four groups of individuals who received both COVID-19 IgM/IgG tests and RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 from February 29, 2020 to April 29, 2020: 1470 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from Leishenshan Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, and Wuhan No. 7 Hospital, 3832 healthcare providers without COVID-19 diagnosis, 19555 general workers, and 1616 other patients to be admitted to the hospital (N=26473). COVID-19 patients who received IgM/IgG tests <21 days after symptom onset were excluded.

ResultsIgG prevalence was 89.8% (95% CI 88.2-91.3%) in COVID-19 patients, 4.0% (95% CI 3.4-4.7%) in healthcare providers, 4.6 (95% CI 4.3-4.9 %) in general workers, and 1.0% in other patients (p all <0.001 for comparisons with COVID-19 patients). IgG prevalence increased significantly by age among healthcare workers and general workers. Prevalence of IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was 31.4% in COVID-19 patients, 1.5% in healthcare providers, 1.3% in general workers, and 0.2% in other patients.

ConclusionsVery few healthcare providers had IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, though a significant proportion of them had been infected with the virus. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, people are unlikely to produce long-lasting protective antibodies against this virus.

8469,COVID-19 higher morbidity and mortality in Chinese regions with lower air quality,"We investigated the geographical character of the COVID-19 infection in China and correlated it with satellite- and ground-based measurements of air quality. Controlling for population size, we found more viral infections in those areas afflicted by high Carbon Monoxide, formaldehyde, PM 2.5, and Nitrogen Dioxide values. Higher mortality was also correlated with relatively poor air quality. Air pollution appears to be a risk factor for the incidence of this disease, similar to smoking. This suggests the detrimental impact of air pollution in these types of respiratory epidemics.

Short summaryO_LIThere is a significant correlation between air pollution and COVID-19 spread and mortality in China.
C_LIO_LIThe correlation stands at a second-order administration level, after controlling for varying population densities and removing Wuhan and Hubei from the dataset.
C_LIO_LILiving in an area with low air quality is a risk factor for becoming infected and dying from this new form of coronavirus.

14703,Accurate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveys require robust multi-antigen assays,"More than 300 SARS-COV-2 serological tests have recently been developed using either the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), the spike glycoprotein subunit (S1), and more recently the receptor binding domain (RBD). Most of the assays report very good clinical performance characteristics in well-controlled clinical settings. However, there is a growing belief that good performance characteristics that are obtained during clinical performance trials might not be sufficient to deliver good diagnostic results in population-wide screens that are usually characterized with low seroprevalence. In this paper, we developed a serological assay against N, S1 and RBD using a bead-based multiplex platform and a rules-based computational approach to assess the performance of single and multi-antigen readouts in well-defined clinical samples and in a population-wide serosurvey from blood donors. Even though assays based on single antigen readouts performed similarly well in the clinical samples, there was a striking difference between the antigens on the population-wide screen. Asymptomatic individuals with low antibody titers and sub-optimal assay specificity might contribute to the large discrepancies in population studies with low seroprevalence. A multi-antigen assay requiring partial agreement between RBD, N and S1 readouts exhibited enhanced specificity, less dependency on assay cut-off values and an overall more robust performance in both sample settings. Our data suggest that assays based on multiple antigen readouts combined with a rules-based computational consensus can provide a more robust platform for routine antibody screening.

9791,Proteomics Uncovers Immunosuppression in COVID-19 Patients with Long Disease Course,"Little is known regarding why a subset of COVID-19 patients exhibited prolonged positivity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we present a longitudinal sera proteomic resource for 37 COVID-19 patients over nine weeks, in which 2700 proteins were quantified with high quality. Remarkably, we found that during the first three weeks since disease onset, while clinical symptoms and outcome were indistinguishable, patients with prolonged disease course displayed characteristic immunological responses including enhanced Natural Killer (NK) cell-mediated innate immunity and regulatory T cell-mediated immunosuppression. We further showed that it is possible to predict the length of disease course using machine learning based on blood protein levels during the first three weeks. Validation in an independent cohort achieved an accuracy of 82%. In summary, this study presents a rich serum proteomic resource to understand host responses in COVID-19 patients and identifies characteristic Treg-mediated immunosuppression in LC patients, nominating new therapeutic target and diagnosis strategy.","Tang, S.; Sun, R.; Xiao, Q.; Mao, T.; Ge, W.; Huang, C.; Luo, M.; Qian, L.; Chen, H.; Zhang, Q.; Li, S.; Liu, W.; Li, S.; Xu, X.; Li, H.; Wu, L.; Dai, J.; Gao, H.; Li, L.; Lu, T.; Liang, X.; Cai, X.; Ruan, G.; Liu, K.; Xu, F.; Li, Y.; Zhu, Y.; Huang, J.; Guo, T.",2020-06-17,Respiratory Medicine,10.1101/2020.06.14.20131078,2,Tiannan Judy Guo,"Key Laboratory of Structural Biology of Zhejiang Province, School of Life Sciences, Westlake University, 18 Shilongshan Road, Hangzhou 310024, Zhejiang Province",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.14.20131078v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.14.20131078v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

For precise development of antibodies and vaccines, the key is to understand which part of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is highly immunogenic on a systematic way. We generate a linear epitope landscape of Spike protein by analyzing serum IgG response of 1,051 COVID-19 patients with a peptide microarray. We reveal two regions that rich of linear epitopes, i.e., CTD and a region close to the S2 cleavage site and fusion peptide. Unexpectedly, we find RBD is lack of linear epitope. Besides 3 moderate immunogenic peptides from RBD, 16 highly immunogenic peptides from other regions of Spike protein are determined. These peptides could serve as the base for precise development of antibodies and vaccines for COVID-19 on a systematic level.

14435,College campuses and COVID-19 mitigation: clinical and economic value,"BackgroundDecisions around US college and university operations will affect millions of students and faculty amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the clinical and economic value of different COVID-19 mitigation strategies on college campuses.

MethodsWe used the Clinical and Economic Analysis of COVID-19 interventions (CEACOV) model, a dynamic microsimulation that tracks infections accrued by students and faculty, accounting for community transmissions. Outcomes include infections, $/infection-prevented, and $/quality-adjusted-life-year ($/QALY). Strategies included extensive social distancing (ESD), masks, and routine laboratory tests (RLT). We report results per 5,000 students (1,000 faculty) over one semester (105 days).

ResultsMitigation strategies reduced COVID-19 cases among students (faculty) from 3,746 (164) with no mitigation to 493 (28) with ESD and masks, and further to 151 (25) adding RLTq3 among asymptomatic students and faculty. ESD with masks cost $168/infection-prevented ($49,200/QALY) compared to masks alone. Adding RLTq3 ($10/test) cost $8,300/infection-prevented ($2,804,600/QALY). If tests cost $1, RLTq3 led to a favorable cost of $275/infection-prevented ($52,200/QALY). No strategies without masks were cost-effective.

ConclusionExtensive social distancing with mandatory mask-wearing could prevent 87% of COVID-19 cases on college campuses and be very cost-effective. Routine laboratory testing would prevent 96% of infections and require low cost tests to be economically attractive.","Losina, E.; Leifer, V.; Millham, L.; Panella, C.; Hyle, E. P.; Mohareb, A.

6950,Rapid implementation of real-time SARS-CoV-2 sequencing to investigate healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections,"BackgroundThe burden and impact of healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections is unknown. We aimed to examine the utility of rapid sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 combined with detailed epidemiological analysis to investigate healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections and to inform infection control measures.

MethodsWe set up rapid viral sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from PCR-positive diagnostic samples using nanopore sequencing, enabling sample-to-sequence in less than 24 hours. We established a rapid review and reporting system with integration of genomic and epidemiological data to investigate suspected cases of healthcare-associated COVID-19.

ResultsBetween 13 March and 24 April 2020 we collected clinical data and samples from 5191 COVID-19 patients in the East of England. We sequenced 1000 samples, producing 747 complete viral genomes. We conducted combined epidemiological and genomic analysis of 299 patients at our hospital and identified 26 genomic clusters involving 114 patients. 66 cases (57.9%) had a strong epidemiological link and 15 cases (13.2%) had a plausible epidemiological link. These results were fed back to clinical, infection control and hospital management teams, resulting in infection control interventions and informing patient safety reporting.

ConclusionsWe established real-time genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in a UK hospital and demonstrated the benefit of combined genomic and epidemiological analysis for the investigation of healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections. This approach enabled us to detect cryptic transmission events and identify opportunities to target infection control interventions to reduce further healthcare-associated infections.","Meredith, L.

16406,Innate lymphoid cell composition associates with COVID-19 disease severity,"ObjectivesThe role of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is unknown. Understanding the immune response in COVID-19 could contribute to unravel the pathogenesis and identification of treatment targets. To describe the phenotypic landscape of circulating ILCs in COVID-19 patients and to identify ILC phenotypes correlated to serum biomarkers, clinical markers, and laboratory parameters relevant in COVID-19.

MethodsBlood samples collected from moderately (n=11) and severely ill (n=12) COVID-19 patients as well as healthy control donors (n=16), were analyzed with 18-parameter flow cytometry. Using supervised and unsupervised approaches, we examined the ILC activation status and homing profile. Clinical and laboratory parameters were obtained from all COVID-19 patients and serum biomarkers were analyzed with multiplex immunoassays.

ResultsILCs were largely depleted from the circulation of COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. Remaining circulating ILCs from patients revealed increased frequencies of ILC2 in moderate COVID-19, with a concomitant decrease of ILC precursors (ILCp), as compared with controls. ILC2 and ILCp showed an activated phenotype with increased CD69 expression, whereas expression levels of the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR4 were significantly altered in ILC2 and ILCp, and ILC1, respectively. The activated ILC profile of COVID-19 patients was associated with soluble inflammatory markers, while frequencies of ILC subsets were correlated with laboratory parameters that reflect the disease severity.

ConclusionThis study provides insights into the potential role of ILCs in immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, particularly linked to the severity of COVID-19.","Garcia, M.; Kokkinou, E.; Carrasco Garcia, A.; Parrot, T.; Palma Medina, L.

Depending on the mitigation policies in place, a daily capacity between 0.7 to 3.6 tests per thousand was required to contain the disease. However, if contact tracing and testing efficacy dropped below 60% (e.g. due to false negatives or reduced tracing capability), the number of infections kept growing exponentially, irrespective of any testing capacity.

Although the clinical features of COVID-19 have been reported previously, data regarding the risk factors associated with the clinical outcomes are lacking.

ObjectivesTo summary and analyze the clinical characteristics and identify the predictors of disease severity and mortality.

MethodsThe PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Cochrane and MedRxiv databases were searched through February 25, 2020. Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) recommendations were followed. We extracted and pooled data using random-e{square}ects meta-analysis to summary the clinical feature of the confirmed COVID-19 patients, and further identify risk factors for disease severity and death. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 method and explained with subgroup analysis and meta-regression.

ResultsA total of 30 studies including 53000 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study, the mean age was 49.8 years (95% CI, 47.5-52.2 yrs) and 55.5% were male. The pooled incidence of severity and mortality were 20.2% (95% CI, 15.1-25.2%) and 3.1% (95% CI, 1.9-4.2%), respectively. The predictor for disease severity included old age ([&ge;] 50 yrs, odds ratio [OR] = 2.61; 95% CI, 2.29-2.98), male (OR =1.348, 95% CI, 1.195-1.521), smoking (OR =1.734, 95% CI, 1.146-2.626) and any comorbidity (OR = 2.635, 95% CI, 2.098-3.309), especially chronic kidney disease (CKD, OR = 6.017; 95% CI, 2.192-16.514), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, OR = 5.323; 95% CI, 2.613-10.847) and cerebrovascular disease (OR = 3.219; 95% CI, 1.486-6.972). In terms of laboratory results, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer and decreased blood platelet and lymphocytes count were highly associated with severe COVID-19 (all for P < 0.001). Meanwhile, old age ([&ge;] 60 yrs, RR = 9.45; 95% CI, 8.09-11.04), followed by cardiovascular disease (RR = 6.75; 95% CI, 5.40-8.43) hypertension (RR = 4.48; 95% CI, 3.69-5.45) and diabetes (RR = 4.43; 95% CI, 3.49-5.61) were found to be independent prognostic factors for the COVID-19 related death.

The physical and mental well-being of patients with severe mental illness in the current circumstances is unknown.

ObjectiveTo evaluate physical and mental well-being, subjective mental health, and need for updated psychiatric management plans in a sample of patients with severe mental illness during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

DesignCross-sectional study of structured telephone assessments conducted between April 23 and June 30, 2020.

SettingRegional psychiatric outpatient care centre in Stockholm, Sweden.

ParticipantsPatients who had not been in contact with their psychiatric clinic between April 9 and April 23, 2020. A total of 1071 patients were contacted by phone.

ExposuresOccurrence of respiratory symptoms, changes in psychiatric symptoms, and the need for updated psychiatric management plans, as determined by the telephone assessors. Subjective mental health rated 0-100 by patients.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresSelf-rated physical, respiratory and psychiatric symptoms according to a semi-structured interview. Subjective mental health rated on a scale from 0-100.

ResultsPatients (n = 1071) were on average 45 years old (SD = 16.9), of which 570 (53%) were female. Neurodevelopmental disorders, psychotic disorders, and bipolar disorder were the most common diagnostic categories. The majority of respondents reported no respiratory symptoms (86%), and few reported light (10%) or severe (4%) respiratory symptoms. Similarly, most patients reported no worsening in psychiatric symptoms (81%). For those who reported a worsening of psychiatric symptoms (19%), the psychiatric management plans that were already in place were deemed appropriate in most cases (16.5%), whereas 22 patients (2.5%) reported a worsening of psychiatric symptoms that warranted an earlier or immediate follow-up by their psychiatric clinic. Patients rated their subjective mental health on a 0-100 scale as 70.5 [95% CI 69 - 71.9] on average (n = 841). Response rates to the questions of the structured assessment varied from 79% - 82%.

Conclusions and RelevanceThe majority of patients reported no respiratory symptoms, no change in psychiatric symptoms and a rather high subjective well-being. Patients in psychiatric care with a mental health care plan experienced stability in the management of their psychiatric symptoms and general well-being, and only a minority were in need of acute support during the early pandemic phase in Stockholm, Sweden.

9972,"Higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization for unemployed: an analysis of 1,298,416 health insured individuals in Germany","BackgroundPrevious research on infectious disease has revealed that infection risk as well as the severity of diseases is related to income and poverty. In this study we investigate if unemployed persons have a higher risk to become hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis compared with employed persons.

MethodsWe used routine data on hospitalizations in a study population of 1,298,416persons between the ages 18 and 65 who were enrolled in a German health insurance and who were active on the labour market (either employed or unemployed). Hospital diagnosis of COVID-19 (ICD-10-GM U07.1 and U07.2) were reported on a daily basis from 01.01.2020 to 04.06.2020. We studied if the rate of persons hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnoses differed by employment situation. Logistic regression models comparing employed with short- and long-term unemployed were calculated adjusting for age and sex.

ResultsIn total, we observed 1,311 persons who were hospitalized, corresponding to a rate of 100.98 cases per 100.000 in our study population. Rates varied between the groups in different employment situations with lowest rates for employed and highest for long-term unemployed. Odds ratio for a hospitalization was 1.84 (1.64 - 2.07) for long-term and 1.18 (0.75 - 1.85) for short-term unemployed compared with employed persons.

ConclusionThe results are in line with earlier (mainly ecological) studies from the USA and Great Britain which found social inequalities in hospitalization risk.

The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of the STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag test (SD BIOSENSOR) by comparison with RT-PCR in a public setting.

MethodIndividuals aged 18 years or older who had booked an appointment for a RT-PCR test on December 26-31, 2020 at a public test center in Copenhagen, Denmark, were invited to participate. An oropharyngeal swab was collected for RT-PCR analysis, immediately followed by a nasopharyngeal swab examined by the STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag test (SD BIOSENSOR). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the antigen test were calculated with test results from RT-PCR as reference.

ResultsOverall, 4697 individuals were included (female n=2456, 53.3%; mean age: 44.7 years, SD: 16.9 years); 196 individuals were tested twice or more. Among 4811 paired conclusive test results from the RT-PCR and antigen tests, 221 (4.6%) RT-PCR tests were positive. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the antigen test were 69.7% and 99.5%, the positive and negative predictive values were 87.0% and 98.5%. Ct values were significantly higher among individuals with false negative antigen tests compared to true positives.

ConclusionThe sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values found indicate that the STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag is a good supplement to RT-PCR testing.","Kronberg Jakobsen, K.; Schmidt Jensen, J.; Todsen, T.; Lippert, F.; Jean-Marie Martel, C.; Klokker, M.; Von Buchwald, C.",2021-01-25,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.01.22.21250042,1,Christian Von Buchwald,"Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery and Audiology, Rigshospitalet.

4645,Lack of coordination and medical disinformation in Canadian self-assessment tools for COVID-19,"As SARS-CoV-2 threatens to overwhelm health systems in Canada, it is imperative that provinces are able to plan and manage an effective and reduced risk response. For this response to be most effective, it must reflect an evidence-based, pan-Canadian response. We designed four different prototypical patients with a combination of common COVID-19 symptoms and opportunities for exposure who were made to self-assess using the 10 provincial COVID-19 self-assessment tools on 1 April. These tools were developed to allow individuals to self-triage, allowing health systems direct capacity to testing and care. We assessed the consistency of the self-assessment tools and of the guidance provided to the patients. While the tools generally screen in three areas, the scope of included COVID-19 associated symptoms as well as the opportunities for exposure, and therefore transmission, vary between provinces such that no two provinces screened in the same way. This was, in turn, reflected in the inconsistency in guidance found. A patient with cough who had travelled abroad or had close contact with a confirmed case within 14 days received the most consistent guidance, with remaining patients receiving guidance ranging from mandatory quarantine or self-isolation to being told they did not have COVID-19 symptoms, guidance at odds with medical evidence. Thus, there is not a single, evidence-based Canadian standard of care simply for self-assessment. Without consistency in public health guidance, Canadians cannot appropriately self-isolate to mitigate community transmission, nor can the necessary valid and reliable data be collected to inform critical epidemiological models that help guide pandemic response. If federal and provincial governments are unable to coordinate a response, Parliament must use its available jurisdiction to legislate a duty on both to follow national standards, so as to improve coordination on COVID-19 in coming months.","Olibris, B.; Attaran, A.",2020-04-18,Health Policy,10.1101/2020.04.14.20065631,1,Amir Attaran,University of Ottawa,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20065631v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20065631v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
6768,Quantitative COVID-19 infectiousness estimate correlating with viral shedding and culturability suggests 68% pre-symptomatic transmissions,"A person clinically diagnosed with COVID 19 can infect others for several days before and after the onset of symptoms. At the epidemiological level, this information on how infectious someone is lies embedded implicitly in the serial interval data. Other clinical indicators of infectiousness based on the temporal kinetics of the viral shedding from the nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum show the former decaying weeks sooner than the latter. In this work, we attempt to provide a better quantitative estimate for the temporal infectiousness profile using serial interval data from a combined 1251 individuals reported in the literature. We show that the infectiousness profile which we calculate correlates well with the viral shedding kinetics from nasopharyngeal swabs ({rho}=0.97, p=0.00) and culturability ({rho}=0.83, p=0.01). The profile suggests that a 68.4% (95% CI: 67.0-69.7%) of the infections are caused by infections before the symptoms appear, which is a much stronger pre-symptomatic influence than what was predicted in the literature 44% (95% CI: 25-69%) using serial data from 77 individuals.","Prakash, M.

6233,Predictive Model with Analysis of the Initial Spread of COVID-19 in India,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has currently ravaged through the world, resulting in over three million confirmed cases and over two hundred thousand deaths, a complete change in daily life as we know it, worldwide lock-downs, travel restrictions, as well as heightened hygiene measures and physical distancing. Being able to analyse and predict the spread of this epidemic-causing disease is hence of utmost importance now, especially as it would help in the reasoning behind important decisions drastically affecting countries and their people, as well as in ensuring efficient resource and utility management. However, the needs of the people and specific conditions of the spread are varying widely from country to country. In this article, we have conducted an in-depth analysis of the spread of COVID-19 in India, patient statistics, as well as proposed a mathematical prediction system that has succeeded in predicting the following days number of cases with 83% accuracy, ever since the first COVID-19 case was declared in India.","Ghosh, S.",2020-05-06,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.05.02.20088997,1,Shinjini Ghosh,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.02.20088997v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.02.20088997v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104262
15954,The effect of face mask mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic on the rate of mask use in the United States,"As COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the United States, there has been a search for policies to prevent individual infections, to slow the spread of the virus in general, and to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. Masks have proven to be a cost-effective measure in all regards, and as such some state governments have begun to mandate their use. However, while the efficacy of masks has been demonstrated, the efficacy of public policies which mandate the use of masks has not been demonstrated. This paper compares the rates of mask use in counties as defined by state policy. It finds that state mandates are strongly correlated with higher rates of mask use, and that mandating use by all individuals in public spaces is more effective than a less comprehensive mandate for mask use by all public facing employees.","Maloney, M.

11024,Implementing a Negative Pressure Isolation Space within a Skilled Nursing Facility to Control SARS-CoV-2 Transmission,"BackgroundIsolation space must be expanded during pandemics involving airborne transmission. Little to no work has been done to establish optimal design strategies and implementation plans to ease surge capacity and expand isolation capacity over long periods in congregate living facilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has an airborne transmission component and requires isolation, which is difficult to accomplish in skilled nursing facilities.

PurposeIn this study we designed, implemented, and validated an isolation space at a skilled nursing facility in Lancaster, PA. The overall goal was to minimize disease transmission between residents and staff within the facility.

Basic ProceduresWe created an isolation space by modifying an existing HVAC system of the SNF. We measured pressure on-site and performed computational fluid dynamics and Lagrangian particle-based modeling to test containment and possible transmission extent given the isolation space is considered negative rather than individual rooms.

Main FindingsPressure data shows the isolation space maintained an average hourly value of (standard deviation) -2.3 Pa (0.12 Pa) pressure differential between it and the external hallway connected to the rest of the facility. No transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between residents isolated to the space occurred, nor did any transmission to the staff or other residents occur. The isolation space was successfully implemented and, as of writing, continues to be operational through the pandemic.

HighlightsO_LINegative pressure isolation space is an effective method to meet needed surge capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics

6216,Model of a Testing-and-Quarantine Strategy to Slow-Down the COVID-19 Outbreak in Guadeloupe,"Using a stochastic epidemic model explicitly considering the entire population of Guadeloupe (1), we explore the domain of solutions presenting an efficient slowing down of the COVID-19 epidemic spread during the post-containment period. The considered model parameters are the basic reproduction number R0 to simulate the effects of social distancing, the time delay{delta} TO_SCPLOWQC_SCPLOW elapsed between the detection of a symptomatic person and her/his placement in quarantine to suppress her/his contagiousness, and the number Na of asymptomatic people tested positively and isolated. We show that acceptable solutions are obtained for a wide range of parameter values. Thanks to a good control of the initial epidemic spread resulting from an early containment and efficient communication by the sanitary and administrative authorities, the present situation corresponds to a pre-epidemic state. The most safe solutions are a combinations of social distancing, numerous testing to perform a systematic isolation of symptomatic patients and guided detection of asymptomatic people in the entourage of localised symptomatic patients.","Allali, M.; Portecop, P.; Carles, M.; Gibert, D.",2020-05-06,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.01.20088138,1,Meriem Allali,CHU POINTE-A-PITRE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20088138v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20088138v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
3670,Confronting COVID-19: Surging critical care capacity in Italy,"The current spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Europe threats Italians capacity and that of other national health systems to effectively respond to the needs of patients who require intensive care, mostly due to pneumonia and derived complications from concomitant disease and age. Predicting the surge in capacity has proved difficult due to the requirement of a subtle combination of diverse expertise and difficult choices to be made on selecting robust measures of critical care utilization, and parsimonious epidemic modelling which account for changing government measures. We modelled the required surge capacity of ICU beds in Italy exclusively for COVID-19 patients at epidemic peak. Because new measures were imposed by the Italian government, suspending nearly all non-essential sectors of the economy, we included the potential impacts of these new measures. The modelling considered those hospitalized and home isolated as quarantined, mimicking conditions on the ground. The percentage of patients in intensive care (out of the daily active confirmed cases) required for our calculations were chosen based on clinical relevance and robustness, and this number was consistently on average 9{middle dot}9% from February 24 to March 6, 2020. Five different scenarios were produced (two positive and three negative). Under most positive scenarios, in which R0 is reduced below 1 (i.e., 0 {middle dot}71), the number of daily active confirmed cases will peak at nearly 89 000 by the early days of April and the total number of intensive care beds exclusively dedicated to COVID-19 patients required in Italy estimated at 8791. Worst scenarios produce unmanageable numbers. Our results suggest that the decisive moment for Italy has come. Jointly reinforcement by the government of the measures approved so far, including home confinement, but even more important the full commitment of the civil society in respecting home confinement, social distancing and hygiene will be key in the next days. Yet, even under the best circumstances, intensive care capacity will need to get closer to 9000 units in the country to avoid preventable mortality. So far, only strong measures were effective in Italy, as shown by our modelling, and this may offer an opportunity to European countries to accelerate their interventions.","Rodriguez Llanes, J.

14647,First report on the Latvian SARS-CoV-2 isolate genetic diversity,"Remaining a major healthcare concern with nearly 27 million confirmed cases worldwide at the time of writing, novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 880 thousand deaths since its outbreak in China, December 2019. First case of a person testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection within the territory of the Republic of Latvia was registered on 2nd of March 2020, nine days prior to the pandemic declaration by WHO. Since then, more than 230 000 tests were carried out confirming a total of 1330 cases of COVID-19 in the country as of 20th of August 2020. Rapidly reacting to the spread of the infection, an ongoing sequencing campaign was started mid-March in collaboration with the local testing laboratories, with an ultimate goal in sequencing as much local viral isolates as possible, resulting in first full-length SARS-CoV-2 isolate genome sequences from the Baltics region being made publicly available in early April. With 109 viral isolates representing [~]8.2% of the total COVID-19 cases in the country being completely sequenced as of today, here we provide a first report on the genetic diversity of Latvian SARS-CoV-2 isolates.","Zrelovs, N.; Ustinova, M.; Silamikelis, I.; Birzniece, L.; Megnis, K.; Rovite, V.; Freimane, L.; Silamikele, L.; Ansone, L.; Pjalkovskis, J.; Fridmanis, D.; Vilne, B.; Priedite, M.; Caica, A.; Gavars, M.; Perminovs, D.; Storozenko, J.; Savicka, O.; Dimina, E.; Dumpis, U.; Klovins, J.",2020-09-30,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.08.20190504,2,Janis Klovins,"Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre, Ratsupites 1, Riga, Latvia, LV-1067",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.20190504v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.20190504v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
14849,Serological evidence of human infection with SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundA rapidly increasing number of serological surveys for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been reported worldwide. A synthesis of this large corpus of data is needed.

PurposeTo evaluate the quality of serological studies and provide a global picture of seroprevalence across demographic and occupational groups, and to provide guidance for conducting better serosurveys.

Data sourcesWe searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and 4 pre-print servers for English-language papers published from December 1, 2019 to September 25, 2020.

Study selectionSerological studies evaluating SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in humans.

Data extractionTwo investigators independently extracted data from studies.

Data SynthesisMost of 230 serological studies, representing tests in >1,400,000 individuals, identified were of low quality based on a standardized study quality scale. In the 51 studies of higher quality, high-risk healthcare workers had higher seroprevalence of 17.1% (95% CI: 9.9-24.4%), compared to low-risk healthcare workers and general population of 5.4% (0.7-10.1%) and 5.3% (4.2-6.4%). Seroprevalence varied hugely across WHO regions, with lowest seroprevalence of general population in Western Pacific region (1.7%, 0.0-5.0%). Generally, the young (<20 years) and the old ([&ge;]65 years) were less likely to be seropositive compared to middle-aged (20-64 years) populations.

Seroprevalence correlated with clinical COVID-19 reports, with pooled average of 7.7 (range: 2.0 to 23.1) serologically-detected-infections per confirmed COVID-19 case.

LimitationsSome heterogeneity cannot be well explained quantitatively.

ConclusionsThe overall quality of seroprevalence studies examined was low. The relatively low seroprevalence among general populations suggest that in most settings, antibody-mediated herd immunity is far from being reached. Given the relatively narrow range of estimates of the ratio of serologically-detected infections to confirmed cases across different locales, reported case counts may help provide insights into the true proportion of the population infected.

1505,Estimated effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent international spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),"Traveller screening is being used to limit further global spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) following its recent emergence. Here, we project the impact of different travel screening programs given remaining uncertainty around the values of key nCoV life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected travellers. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. These findings emphasize the need for measures to track travellers who become ill after being missed by a travel screening program. We make our model available for interactive use so stakeholders can explore scenarios of interest using the most up-to-date information. We hope these findings contribute to evidence-based policy to combat the spread of nCoV, and to prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.","Gostic, K.; Gomez, A. C. R.; Mummah, R.

7745,A pandemic at the Tunisian scale. Mathematical modelling of reported and unreported COVID-19 infected cases,"Starting from the city of Wuhan in China in late December 2019, the pandemic quickly spread to the rest of the world along the main intercontinental air routes. At the time of writing this article, there are officially about five million infections and more than 300 000 deaths. Statistics vary widely from country to country, revealing significant differences in anticipation and management of the crisis. We propose to examine the COVID-19 epidemic in Tunisia through mathematical models, which aim to determine the actual number of infected cases and to predict the course of the epidemic. As of May 11, 2020, there are officially 1032 COVID-19 infected cases in Tunisia. 45 people have died. Using a mathematical model based on the number of reported infected cases, the number of deaths, and the effect of the 18-day delay between infection and death, this study estimates the actual number of COVID-19 cases in Tunisia as 2555 cases. This paper analyses the evolution of the epidemic in Tunisia using population dynamics with an SEIR model combining susceptible cases S(t), asymptomatic infected cases A(t), reported infected cases V(t), and unreported infected cases U(t). This work measures the basic reproduction number [Formula], which is the average number of people infected by a COVID-19 infected person. The model predicts an [Formula]. Strict containment measures have led to a significant reduction in the reproduction rate. Contact tracing and respect for isolation have an impact: at the current time, we compute that Tunisia has an [Formula] (95% CI 0.14-0.70). These values depend on physical separation and can vary over time depending on the management of suspicious cases. Their objective estimation and the study of their evolution are however necessary to understand the pandemic and to reduce their unintended damage (due to an absence of symptoms, or the confusion of certain symptoms with less contagious diseases, or unavailable or unreliable tests).","Abdeljaoued-Tej, I.",2020-05-23,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.21.20108621,1,Ines Abdeljaoued-Tej,"BIMS Laboratory, LR16IPT09, Institut Pasteur de Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunisia",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.20108621v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.20108621v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
14863,Ignoring the elephant in the room: factors contributing to inadequate access to condoms and sources of condoms during novel coronavirus diseases 2019 in South Africa.,"Evidence has shown that the prescribed lockdown and physical distancing due to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have made accessing essential health care services much difficult in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Access to contraception is essential and should not be denied, even in a global crisis, because it is associated with several health benefits. It is paramount to maintain timely access to contraception without unnecessary barriers. Hence, this study examines the factors contributing to limited access to condoms and sources of condoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa (SA).The first secondary dataset on coronavirus from the National Income Dynamic Study (NIDS) conducted in SA during the coronavirus pandemic was employed in this study. This study involved 4,517 respondents. Data were analysed using frequency analysis, chi-square test and binary logistic regression analysis. Almost one-quarter of South Africans could not access condoms, and every 7 in 10 South Africans preferred public or government hospitals as a source of condoms. Female South Africans (aOR=0.86; 95% CI=0.69-1.08), those aged 35-45 (aOR=0.96; 95% CI=0.73-1.28) and those residing in KwaZulu-Natal province (aOR=0.30; 95% CI=0.17-0.52) were 14%, 4% and 70% respectively less likely to have access to condoms during the COVID-19 lockdown. Findings from the study suggest strategies and interventions that will be tailored towards non-obstruction of contraception access during the on-going COVID-19 or any future pandemic. Moreover, special consideration should be given to certain provinces, the uneducated and those in the 4th quintile of wealth-income in South Africa.","Bolarinwa, O.

6502,The race to find a SARS-CoV-2 drug can only be won by a few chosen drugs: a systematic review of registers of clinical trials of drugs aimed at preventing or treating COVID-19,"Considering the massive amount of clinical trial registers aimed to find effective drugs for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, it is challenging to have a comprehensive view of which drugs are being studied more extensively and when is expected that we will have consistent results regarding their effectiveness. This systematic review included all clinical trials on pharmacological therapy related to COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 registered at the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO-ICTRP) up to April 22, 2020. Clinical trials characteristics (country, design, sample size, main outcomes, expected completion data, type of participants, length of the interventions, main outcomes). How many trials and the accumulated sample size by drug or combination of drugs, and by month in 2020 was depicted. We identified 412 clinical trials registers addressing the effect of pharmacological treatments on COVID-19, predominantly from Asia and Europe (42.2% and 31.1% of clinical trials registers, respectively). The most main outcomes studied were clinical recovery (54.4% of the clinical trials registers, respiratory recovery (28.2%) mortality (27.4%), viral load/negativity (20.4%). During 2020, a huge amount of clinical trials are expected to be completed: 41 trials (60,366 participants) using hydroxychloroquine, 20 trials (1,588 participants) using convalescents plasma, 18 trials (6,830 participants) using chloroquine, 12 trials (9,938 participants using lopinavir/ritonavir, 11 trials (1,250 participants) using favipiravir, 10 trials (2,175 participants) using tocilizumab and 6 trials (13,540 participants) using Remdesivir. The distribution of the number of registered clinical trials among the different therapeutic options leads to an excess of sample size for some and a lack for others. Our data allow us to conclude that by the end of June we will have results of almost 20 trials involving 40000 patients for hydroxychloroquine and 5 trials with 4500 patients for remdesivir; however, low statistical power is expected from the 9 clinical trials testing the efficacy of favipiravir or the 5 testing tocilizumab, since they will recruit less than 1000 patients each one.","Martinez-Vizcaino, V.; Mesas, A.

18016,"Simple Accurate Regression-Based Forecasting of Intensive Care Unit Admissions due to COVID-19 in Ontario, Canada","The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has proven challenging clinically, and at the population level, due to heterogeneity in both transmissibility and severity. Recent case incidence in Ontario, Canada (autumn 2020) has outstripped incidence in seen during the first (spring) pandemic wave; but has been associated with a lower incidence of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths. We hypothesized that differential ICU burden might be explained by increased testing volumes, as well as the shift in mean case age from older to younger. We constructed a negative binomial regression model using only three covariates, at a 2-week lag: log10(weekly cases); log10(weekly deaths); and mean weekly case age. This model reproduced observed ICU admission volumes, and demonstrated good preliminary predictive validity. Furthermore, when admissions were used in combination with ICU length of stay, our modeled estimates demonstrated excellent convergent validity with ICU occupancy data reported by the Canadian Institute for Health Information. Our approach needs external validation in other settings and at larger and smaller geographic scales, but appears to be a useful short-term forecasting tool for ICU resource demand; we also demonstrate that the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not meaningfully changed in Ontario between the first and second waves, but the demographics of those infected, and the fraction of cases identified, have.","Fisman, D.; Tuite, A.",2020-11-17,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.11.16.20231399,1,David Fisman,University of Toronto,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.16.20231399v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.16.20231399v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
10709,Cluster analysis of epidemiological characteristic features of confirmed cases with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outside China: a descriptive study,"BackgroundNovel coronavirus COVID-19 has caused significant global outbreaks outside China. Many countries have closed their borders with China and performed obligate protective procedures, however, this disease was still rising worldwide. In this report, we aim to identify transmission patterns from China to other countries, along with describing the disease control situation of countries.

MethodsWe retrospectively collected information about infected cases with COVID-19 from WHO situation reports, official notification websites of health ministries and reliable local newspapers from each country. Descriptive and cluster analysis was performed to describe the transmission characteristics while the logistic regression test was used to estimate the risk factors for the occurrence of an infected individual with an unknown source.

ResultsA total of 446 infected cases were recorded from 24 countries outside China until 12 February 2020, with the number of reported infected cases were doubled every 3.08 {+/-} 0.35 days (range from 2.6 to 3.9). Besides the spread from China, the transmission was originated from sub-endemic countries (Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, France, German). Out of 6 countries got occurrence of an infected individual with unknown source and possible potential factors contributed to this occurrence was a time of epidemic circulating, number of patients and number of clusters when the occurrence still has not happened, and notably, the unreported situation of Chinese tourists information.

ConclusionsThe situational reports of each country about COVID-19 should be more detailed mentioning the transmissions routes with keeping contact tracing of the unknown cases to increase the control of this disease.","Nguyen-Tran, M.-D.; Abozaid, A.

8906,Host response-based screening to identify undiagnosed cases of COVID-19and expand testing capacity,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges in diagnostic testing. At the beginning of the epidemic, a confluence of factors resulted in delayed deployment of PCR-based diagnostic tests, resulting in lack of testing of individuals with symptoms of the disease. Although these tests are now more widely available, it is estimated that a three- to ten-fold increase in testing capacity will be required to ensure adequate surveillance as communities reopen1. In response to these challenges, we evaluated potential roles of host response-based screening in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Previous work from our group showed that the nasopharyngeal (NP) level of CXCL10, a protein produced as part of the host response to viral infection, is a sensitive predictor of respiratory virus infection across a wide spectrum of viruses2. Here, we show that NP CXCL10 is elevated during SARS-CoV-2 infection and use a CXCL10-based screening strategy to identify four undiagnosed cases of COVID-19 in Connecticut in early March. In a second set of samples tested at the Yale New Haven Hospital, we show that NP CXCL10 had excellent performance as a rule-out test (NPV 0.99, 95% C.I. 0.985-0.997). Our results demonstrate how biomarker-based screening could be used to leverage existing PCR testing capacity to rapidly enable widespread testing for COVID-19.

19083,Routine asymptomatic testing strategies for airline travel during the COVID-19 pandemic: a simulation analysis,"BackgroundAirline travel has been significantly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic due to concern for individual risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and population-level transmission risk from importation. Routine viral testing strategies for COVID-19 may facilitate safe airline travel through reduction of individual and/or population-level risk, although the effectiveness and optimal design of these ""test-and-travel"" strategies remain unclear.

MethodsWe developed a microsimulation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a cohort of airline travelers to evaluate the effectiveness of various testing strategies to reduce individual risk of infection and population-level risk of transmission. We evaluated five testing strategies in asymptomatic passengers: i) anterior nasal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) within 3 days of departure; ii) PCR within 3 days of departure and PCR 5 days after arrival; iii) rapid antigen test on the day of travel (assuming 90% of the sensitivity of PCR during active infection); iv) rapid antigen test on the day of travel and PCR 5 days after arrival; and v) PCR within 3 days of arrival alone. The travel period was defined as three days prior to the day of travel and two weeks following the day of travel, and we assumed passengers followed guidance on mask wearing during this period. The primary study outcome was cumulative number of infectious days in the cohort over the travel period (population-level transmission risk); the secondary outcome was the proportion of infectious persons detected on the day of travel (individual-level risk of infection). Sensitivity analyses were conducted.

FindingsAssuming a community SARS-CoV-2 incidence of 50 daily infections, we estimated that in a cohort of 100,000 airline travelers followed over the travel period, there would be a total of 2,796 (95% UI: 2,031, 4,336) infectious days with 229 (95% UI: 170, 336) actively infectious passengers on the day of travel. The pre-travel PCR test (within 3 days prior to departure) reduced the number of infectious days by 35% (95% UI: 27, 42) and identified 88% (95% UI: 76, 94) of the actively infectious travelers on the day of flight; the addition of PCR 5 days after arrival reduced the number of infectious days by 79% (95% UI: 71, 84). The rapid antigen test on the day of travel reduced the number of infectious days by 32% (95% UI: 25, 39) and identified 87% (95% UI: 81, 92) of the actively infectious travelers; the addition of PCR 5 days after arrival reduced the number of infectious days by 70% (95% UI: 65, 75). The post-travel PCR test alone (within 3 days of landing) reduced the number of infectious days by 42% (95% UI: 31, 51). The ratio of true positives to false positives varied with the incidence of infection. The overall study conclusions were robust in sensitivity analysis.

InterpretationRoutine asymptomatic testing for COVID-19 prior to travel can be an effective strategy to reduce individual risk of COVID-19 infection during travel, although post-travel testing with abbreviated quarantine is likely needed to reduce population-level transmission due to importation of infection when traveling from a high to low incidence setting.","Kiang, M.

9276,"CASUAL SEX AMONG MSM DURING THE PERIOD OF SHELTERING IN PLACE TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF COVID-19: RESULTS OF NATIONAL, ONLINE SURVEYS IN BRAZIL AND PORTUGAL","BackgroundSheltering in place to reduce the spread of COVID-19 may have adverse effects on mental and sexual health, particularly for LGBT populations whose social support may be fragile. In this study, we investigated the extent to which Brazilian and Portuguese MSM had casual sex partners outside their homes during the period of sheltering in place for the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsAn online survey was implemented nationally in Brazil and Portugal in April 2020, during the period of social isolation for COVID-19, with a sample of 2,361 MSM (1,651 in Brazil, 710 in Portugal). Recruitment was done through meeting apps and Facebook groups catering to MSM. Data collection was online via CASI.

ResultsOver 95% of MSM were sheltering at least partially at the time of the survey. Nearly 50% said sheltering had a high impact on their lives. A majority (53.0%) had casual sex partners during sheltering. Factors that increased the odds of engaging in casual sex in Brazil were having group sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.4), living in a urban area (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.2), feeling that sheltering had high impact on daily life (aOR 3.0, 95% CI 1.1-8.3), having casual vs steady partners (aOR 2.5, 95% CI 1.8-3.5), and not decreasing the number of partners during the COVID-19 epidemic (aOR 6.5, 95% CI 4.2-10.0). In Portugal, the odds of engaging in casual sex increased with using Facebook to find partners (aOR 4.6, 95% CI 3.0-7.2), not decreasing the number of partners during the COVID-19 epidemic (aOR 3.8, 95% CI 2.9-5.9), usually (pre-COVID-19) finding partners in physical venues (aOR 5.4, 95% CI 3.2-8.9), feeling that the isolation had high impact on daily life (aOR 3.0, 95% CI 1.3-6.7), and HIV-positive serostatus (aOR 11.7, 95% CI 4.7-29.2). Surprisingly, taking PrEP/Truvada to prevent COVID-19 was reported by 12.7% of MSM.

ConclusionsThe COVID-19 epidemic has not stopped the majority of Brazilian and Portuguese MSM from finding sexual partners outside their home, with high risk sexual behaviors continuing. Public health messages for the prevention of COVID-19 need to be crafted to explicitly link sexual behavior to reduce pandemics in the current moment.","De Sousa, A. F. L.; Oliveira, L.

4930,Self-burnout - a new path to the end of COVID-19,"In this work we use mathematical modeling to describe a possible route to the end of COVID-19, which does not feature either vaccination or herd immunity. We call this route self-burnout. We consider a region with (a) no influx of corona cases from the outside, (b) extensive social distancing, though not necessarily a full lockdown, and (c) high testing capacity relative to the actual number of new cases per day. These conditions can make it possible for the region to initiate the endgame phase of epidemic management, wherein the disease is slowly made to burn itself out through a combination of social distancing, sanitization, contact tracing and preventive testing. The dynamics of the case trajectories in this regime are governed by a single-variable first order linear delay differential equation, whose stability criterion can be obtained analytically. Basis this criterion, we conclude that the social mobility restrictions should be such as to ensure that on the average, one person interacts closely (from the transmission viewpoint) with at most one other person over a 4-5 day period. If the endgame can be played out for a long enough time, we claim that the Coronavirus can eventually get completely contained without affecting a significant fraction of the regions population. We present estimates of the duration for which the epidemic is expected to last, finding an interval of approximately 5-15 weeks after the self-burnout phase is initiated. South Korea, Austria, Australia, New Zealand and the states of Goa, Kerala and Odisha in India appear to be well on the way towards containing COVID by this method.","Shayak, B.; Rand, R.

13479,COVID-19 among nursing staff: Settings and regional differences,"PurposeThis study was carried out to describe settings of and regional differences in the occurrence of COVID-19 among nursing staff, analysing COVID-19 symptoms, testing and diagnosis procedures.

DesignWe used an online survey to conduct this cross-sectional study among nursing staff in different settings. Data collection was carried out between 12 May and 13 July 2020.

MethodsThe survey included questions that allowed us to collect demographic data (e.g. age), professional qualifications (e.g. nurse, nurse aid) and data regarding the federal states and settings in which the participants worked. In additon, we asked the participants to describe their COVID-19 symptoms, if any were experienced, and the result of COVID-19 testing that they underwent. We used descriptive statistics as well as bivariate analysis methods to calculate differences.

FindingsMore than 80% of the nursing staff (N = 2600) were women, nearly half of these staff members worked in the province of Styria and about three-quarters worked in hospitals. In general, nearly every sixth nurse reported experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. We found statistically significant differences between the settings and the federal provinces with regard to the COVID-19 symptoms reported, but not the test results. The highest porportion of nurses who experienced symptoms worked in lower Austria and in the primary care sector. In total, 1.6% of the participating nurses were tested for COVID-19, as well as about 1% of the nurses who worked in the nursing homes. The highest number of tests were carried out in Vienna followed by the province of Burgenland. In total, all of the nurses who underwent testing were diagnosed with COVID-19.

ConclusionsOnly 1% of the nurses who worked in nursing homes were tested. This group of nurses takes care of the most vulnerable and high-risk group in Austrian society.

Therefore, the nursing home staff should have the possibility to be tested even though they did not experience/report any symptoms. The highest prorportion of nurses who experienced symptoms worked in the primary care sector. In the future during a pandemic, health care staff should be comprehensively tested in all settings.

Clinical RelevanceProviding insights into COVID-19 symptoms experienced by nursing staff workforce and testing for COVID-19 can help us address these aspects in future pandemics more efficiently. In addition, these insights can help to shift the perspectives from critical and acute settings to other settings, e.g. nursing homes. This is an important change in perspectives, as these nurses have worked with the most vulnerable and high-risk group during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ensuring the safety of nursing home residents and providing, high-quality nursing care and interventions can reduce hospital admission rates, decrease health care costs during such pandemics and might even reduce secondary morbidity and mortality.","Hoedl, M.; Eglseer, D.; Bauer, S.",2020-08-17,Nursing,10.1101/2020.08.14.20174797,1,Manuela Hoedl,"Institute of Nursing Science, Medical University of Graz",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20174797v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20174797v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

MethodsIn this paper, we evaluate 10 different COVID-19 symptom checkers screening 50 COVID-19 case reports alongside 410 non-COVID-19 control cases.

ResultsWe find that the number of correctly assessed cases varies considerably between different symptom checkers, with Symptoma (F1=0.92, MCC=0.85) showing the overall best performance followed by Infermedica (F1=0.80, MCC=0.61).","Munsch, N.; Martin, A.; Gruarin, S.; Nateqi, J.; Abdarahmane, I.; Weingartner-Ortner, R.; Knapp, B.",2020-08-19,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.05.22.20109777,3,Bernhard Knapp,Symptoma,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.20109777v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.20109777v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
15747,An integrated clinical and genetic model for predicting risk of severe COVID-19,"Background: Age and gender are often the only considerations in determining risk of severe COVID-19. There is an urgent need for accurate prediction of the risk of severe COVID-19 for use in workplaces and healthcare settings, and for individual risk management. Methods: Clinical risk factors and a panel of 64 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified from published data. We used logistic regression to develop a model for severe COVID-19 in 1,582 UK Biobank participants aged 50 years and over who tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus: 1,018 with severe disease and 564 without severe disease. Model discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: A model incorporating the SNP score and clinical risk factors (AUC=0.786) had 111% better discrimination of disease severity than a model with just age and gender (AUC=0.635). The effects of age and gender are attenuated by the other risk factors, suggesting that it is those risk factors -- not age and gender -- that confer risk of severe disease. In the whole UK Biobank, most are at low or only slightly elevated risk, but one-third are at two-fold or more increased risk. Conclusions: We have developed a model that enables accurate prediction of severe COVID-19. Continuing to rely on age and gender alone to determine risk of severe COVID-19 will unnecessarily classify healthy older people as being at high risk and will fail to accurately quantify the increased risk for younger people with comorbidities.","Dite, G.

17956,No evidence of increase in suicide in Greece during the first wave of Covid-19,"Background and ObjectiveMental health outcomes have reportedly worsened in several countries during the Covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns. In the present study we examined whether suicides increased in Greece during the first wave of the pandemic.

MethodsWe used daily suicide estimates from a Suicide Observatory in Greece from 2015-2020 and followed three methodologies: A descriptive approach, an interrupted time series analysis, and a differences-in-differences econometric model.

ResultsWe did not find any empirical evidence of any increase in suicides during the first wave of Covid-19 and the lockdown in any of the three approaches used.

ConclusionsSuicides did not seem to increase during the first wave of covid-19 and lockdown in Greece. However, this does not mean that mental health did not deteriorate, or that we will not observe an increase in suicides during the second wave. Protective factors for Greece during the first wave may include working from home (for those able to tele-work), strong family ties, advertising of a suicide hotline and income support for the unemployed.","Vandoros, S.; Theodorikakou, O.; Katsadoros, K.; Zafeiropoulou, D.; Kawachi, I.",2020-11-16,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.11.13.20231571,1,Sotiris Vandoros,"King\'s College London and Harvard T.H.

9018,HIGH LIVER FAT ASSOCIATES WITH HIGHER RISK OF DEVELOPING SYMPTOMATIC COVID-19 INFECTION - INITIAL UK BIOBANK OBSERVATIONS,"BackgroundA high proportion of COVID-19 patients develop acute liver dysfunction. Early research has suggested that pre-existing fatty liver disease may be a significant risk factor for hospitalisation. Liver fat, in particular, is a modifiable parameter and can be a target for public health policy and individual patient plans. In this study we aimed to assess pre-existing liver disease as a risk factor for developing symptomatic COVID-19.

MethodsFrom 502,506 participants from the UK Biobank, 42,146 underwent MRI (aged 45-82), and had measures of liver fat, liver fibroinflammatory disease and liver iron. Patients were censored on May 28th to determine how many had tested for COVID-19 with symptomatic disease. UK testing was restricted to those with symptoms in hospital. COVID-19 symptoms included fever, dry cough, sore throat, diarrhoea and fatigue. Univariate analysis was performed on liver phenotypic biomarkers to determine if these variables increased risk of symptomatic COVID-19, and compared to previously described risk factors associated with severe COVID-19, including to age, ethnicity, gender and obesity,

FindingsIncreased liver fat was associated with a higher risk for symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 in this population in univariate analysis(OR:1.85, p = 0.03). In obese participants, only those with concomitant fatty liver([&ge;]10%) were at increased risk(OR:2.96, p = 0.02), with those having normal liver fat (< 5%) showing no increased risk(OR:0.36, p = 0.09).

ConclusionsUK Biobank data demonstrated an association between pre-existing liver disease and obesity with severe COVID-19, with higher proportions of liver fat in obese individuals a likely risk factor for symptomatic disease and severity.

Public policy measures to protect patients with liver disease who may have almost double the risk of the general population should be considered, especially as dietary and pharmacological strategies to reduce body weight and liver fat already exist.

4769,Histopathology and Ultrastructural Findings of Fatal COVID-19 Infections,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 is the cause of an ongoing pandemic with a projected 100,000 to 240,000 U.S. deaths. To date, documentation of histopathologic features in fatal cases of COVID-19 has been limited due to small sample size and incomplete organ sampling.

MethodsPost-mortem examinations were performed on 12 fatal COVID-19 cases in Washington State during February-March 2020. Clinical and laboratory data were reviewed. Tissue examination of all major organs was performed by light microscopy and electron microscopy. The presence of viral RNA in sampled tissues was tested by RT-PCR.

ResultsAll 12 patients were older with significant preexisting comorbidities. The major pulmonary finding was diffuse alveolar damage in the acute and/or organizing phases with virus identified in type I and II pneumocytes by electron microscopy. The kidney demonstrated viral particles in the tubular epithelium, endothelium, and podocytes without significant inflammation. Viral particles were also observed in the trachea and large intestines. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the cardiac tissue of a patient with lymphocytic myocarditis. RT-PCR also detected viral RNA in the subcarinal lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and large intestines.

ConclusionSARS-CoV-2 represents the third novel coronavirus to cause widespread human disease since 2002. Similar to SARS and MERS, the primary pathology was diffuse alveolar damage with virus located in the pneumocytes. However, other major organs including the heart and kidneys may be susceptible to viral replication and damage leading to increased mortality in those with disseminated disease. Understanding the pathology of SARS-CoV-2 will be essential to design effective therapies.","Bradley, B. T.; Maioli, H.; Johnston, R.; Chaudhry, I.; Fink, S.

17101,Modelling trachoma post 2020: Opportunities for mitigating the impact of COVID-19 and accelerating progress towards elimination.,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted planned annual antibiotic mass drug administration (MDA) activities which have formed the cornerstone of the largely successful global efforts to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem.

MethodsUsing a mathematical model we investigate the impact of interruption to MDA in trachoma-endemic settings. We evaluate potential measures to mitigate this impact and consider alternative strategies for accelerating progress in those areas where the trachoma elimination targets may not be achievable otherwise.

ResultsWe demonstrate that for districts which were hyperendemic at baseline, or where the trachoma elimination thresholds have not already been achieved after 3 rounds of MDA, the interruption to planned MDA could lead to a delay greater than the duration of interruption. We also show that an additional round of MDA in the year following MDA resumption could effectively mitigate this delay. For districts where probability of elimination under annual MDA was already very low, we demonstrate that more intensive MDA schedules are needed to achieve agreed targets.

ConclusionThrough appropriate use of additional MDA, the impact of COVID-19 in terms of delay to reaching trachoma elimination targets can be effectively mitigated. Additionally, more frequent MDA may accelerate progress towards 2030 goals.","Borlase, A.; Blumberg, S.; Callahan, E. K.; Deiner, M. S.; Nash, S. D.; Porco, T. C.; Solomon, A. W.; Lietman, T.

18155,REACT-1 round 6 updated report: high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 swab positivity with reduced rate of growth in England at the start of November 2020,"BackgroundEngland is now in the midst of its second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple regions of the country are at high infection prevalence and all areas experienced rapid recent growth of the epidemic during October 2020.

MethodsREACT-1 is a series of community surveys of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR swab-positivity in England designed to monitor the spread of the epidemic and thus increase situational awareness. Round 6 of REACT-1 commenced swab-collection on 16th October. A prior interim report included data from 16th to 25th October for 85,971 participants. Here, we report data for the entire round on 160,175 participants with swab results obtained up to 2nd November 2020.

ResultsOverall weighted prevalence of infection in the community in England was 1.3% or 130 people per 10,000 infected, up from 60 people per 10,000 in the round 5 report (18th September to 5th October 2020), doubling every 24 days on average since the prior round. The corresponding R number was estimated to be 1.2. Prevalence of infection was highest in North West (2.4%, up from 1.2%), followed by Yorkshire and The Humber (2.3% up from 0.84%), West Midlands (1.6% up from 0.60%), North East (1.5% up from 1.1%), East Midlands (1.3% up from 0.56%), London (0.97%, up from 0.54%), South West (0.80% up from 0.33%), South East (0.69% up from 0.29%), and East of England (0.69% up from 0.30%). Rapid growth in the South observed in the first half of round 6 was no longer apparent in the second half of round 6. We also observed a decline in prevalence in Yorkshire and The Humber during this period. Comparing the first and second halves of round 6, there was a suggestion of decline in weighted prevalence in participants aged 5 to 12 years and in those aged 25 to 44 years. While prevalence remained high, in the second half of round 6 there was suggestion of a slight fall then rise that was seen nationally and also separately in both the North and the South.

ConclusionThe impact of the second national lockdown in England is not yet known. We provide here a detailed description of swab-positivity patterns at national, regional and local scales for the period immediately preceding lockdown, against which future trends in prevalence can be evaluated.","Riley, S.; Ainslie, K.

20027,"Empty Streets, Speeding and Motor Vehicle Collisions during Covid-19 Lockdowns: Evidence from Northern Ireland","Covid-19 and lockdowns have had spillover effects on other health outcomes. Motor vehicle collisions (MVC) are likely to have been affected by the pandemic due to, among others, less traffic volume and speeding on empty streets. This paper studies the impact of the pandemic on MVCs in Northern Ireland. Using monthly data on injuries and deaths, we find a steep decline in slight and serious injuries compared to what would have been expected in the absence of the pandemic. However, we find no effect on the number of deaths. Based on data from speeding tickets, a plausible explanation for the differential effect on the number of injuries and deaths is speeding on empty streets during the pandemic.","Vandoros, S.; Papailias, F.",2021-01-05,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.01.03.21249173,1,Sotiris Vandoros,King\'s College London,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.03.21249173v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.03.21249173v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
18415,Which policies most effectively reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools?,"IntroductionNew York City (NYC) has the largest public school system in the United States (US). During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, NYC was the first major US city to open schools for in-person learning in the 2020-2021 academic year. Several policies were implemented to reduce the risk of in-school transmission, including infection control measures (facemasks, physical distancing, enhanced indoor ventilation, cohorting of small groups, and hand hygiene), option of all-remote instruction, alternative options for how class schedules would rotate in-person and remote instruction, daily symptom screening, and testing 10-20% of students and staff weekly or monthly depending on local case rates. We sought to determine which of these policies had the greatest impact on reducing the risk of in-school transmission.

MethodsWe evaluated the impact of each policy by referring to global benchmarks for the secondary attack rate (SAR) of SARS-CoV-2 in school settings and by simulating the potential for transmission in NYCs rotating cohort schedules, in which teachers could act as ""bridges"" across rotating cohorts. We estimated the impact of (1) infection control measures, (2) providing an option of all-remote instruction, (3) choice of class scheduling for in-person learners, (4) daily symptom screening, (5) testing to curtail transmission, and (6) testing to identify school outbreaks. Each policy was assessed independently of other policies, with the exception of symptom screening and random testing, which were assessed both independently and jointly.

ResultsAmong the policies analyzed, the greatest transmission reduction was associated with the infection control measures, followed by small class cohorts with an option for all-remote instruction, symptom screening, and finally randomly testing 10-20% of school attendees. Assuming adult staff are the primary source of within-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission, weekly testing of staff could be at least as effective as symptom screening, and potentially more so if testing days occur in the beginning of the workweek with results available by the following day. A combination of daily symptom screening and testing on the first workday of each week could reduce transmission by 70%.

ConclusionsAdherence to infection control is the highest priority for safe school re-opening. Further transmission reduction can be achieved through small rotating class cohorts with an option for remote learning, widespread testing at the beginning of the work week, and daily symptom screening and self-isolation. Randomly testing 10-20% of attendees weekly or monthly does not meaningfully curtail transmission and may not detect outbreaks before they have spread beyond a handful of individuals. School systems considering re-opening during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic or similarly virulent respiratory disease outbreaks should consider these relative impacts when setting policy priorities.","Bershteyn, A.; Kim, H.-Y.; Mcgillen, J.

7858,Global Infodemiology of COVID-19: Focus on Google web searches and Instagram hashtags,"BackgroundThough  infodemiological methods have been used in COVID-19 research, an examination of the extent of infodemic monikers (misinformation) use on the Internet remains limited.

ObjectiveTo investigate Internet search behavior related to COVID-19 and examine the circulation of infodemic monikers through two platforms--Google and Instagram--during the current global pandemic.

MethodsUsing Google Trends and Instagram hashtags (#), we explored Internet search activities and behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic from February 20, 2020, to May 06, 2020. We investigated the names used to identify the virus, health and risk perception, life during the lockdown, and information related to the adoption of COVID-19 infodemic monikers. We computed the average peak volume (APC) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) during the study period for the monikers.

ResultsThe top five COVID-19-related terms in the Google searches were ""coronavirus"", ""corona"", ""COVID"", ""virus"", ""corona virus"", and ""COVID-19"". Countries with a higher number of COVID-19 cases had a higher number of COVID-19 queries on Google. The monikers ""coronavirus ozone"", ""coronavirus laboratory"", ""coronavirus 5G"", ""coronavirus conspiracy"" and ""coronavirus bill gates"" were widely circulated on the Internet. Searches about  tips and cures for COVID-19 spiked in relation to the U.S. president speculating about a  miracle cure and suggesting the injection of disinfectant to treat the virus. Around two-thirds (66.1%) of Instagram users used the hashtags ""COVID-19"", and ""coronavirus"" to disperse virus-related information.

ConclusionGlobally, there is a growing interest in COVID-19, and numerous infodemic monikers continue to circulate on the Internet. Based on our findings, we hope to encourage mass media regulators and health organizers to be vigilant and diminish the use and circulation of these infodemic monikers on the Internet, to decrease the spread of misinformation.","Rovetta, A.; Bhagavathula, A.

6088,Novel Spatiotemporal Feature Extraction Parallel Deep Neural Network for Forecasting Confirmed Cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019,"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic continues as of March 26 and spread to Europe on approximately February 24. A report from April 29 revealed 1.26 million confirmed cases and 125 928 deaths in Europe. This study proposed a novel deep neural network framework, COVID-19Net, which parallelly combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional gated recurrent units (GRUs). Three European countries with severe outbreaks were studied--Germany, Italy, and Spain--to extract spatiotemporal feature and predict the number of confirmed cases. The prediction results acquired from COVID-19Net were compared to those obtained using a CNN, GRU, and CNN-GRU. The mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error, which are commonly used model assessment indices, were used to compare the accuracy of the models. The results verified that COVID-19Net was notably more accurate than the other models. The mean absolute percentage error generated by COVID-19Net was 1.447 for Germany, 1.801 for Italy, and 2.828 for Spain, which were considerably lower than those of the other models. This indicated that the proposed framework can accurately predict the accumulated number of confirmed cases in the three countries and serve as a crucial reference for devising public health strategies.","Huang, C.-J.; Shen, Y.; Kuo, P.-H.; Chen, Y.-H.",2020-05-05,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.30.20086538,1,Yung-Hsiang Chen,National Pingtung University of Science and Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.30.20086538v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.30.20086538v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.seps.2020.100976
3319,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"Social distancing policies are critical but economically painful measures to flatten the curve against emergent infectious diseases. As the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spread throughout the United States in early 2020, the federal government issued social distancing recommendations but left to the states the most difficult and consequential decisions restricting behavior, such as canceling events, closing schools and businesses, and issuing stay-at-home orders. We present an original dataset of state-level social distancing policy responses to the epidemic and explore how political partisanship, COVID-19 caseload, and policy diffusion explain the timing of governors decisions to mandate social distancing. An event history analysis of five social distancing policies across all fifty states reveals the most important predictors are political: all else equal, Republican governors and governors from states with more Trump supporters were slower to adopt social distancing policies. These delays are likely to produce significant, on-going harm to public health.","Adolph, C.; Amano, K.; Bang-Jensen, B.; Fullman, N.; Wilkerson, J.",2020-03-31,Health Policy,10.1101/2020.03.30.20046326,1,Christopher Adolph,University of Washington,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20046326v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20046326v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1215/03616878-8802162
5059,Modeling the Effective Control Strategy for Transmission Dynamics of Global Pandemic COVID-19,"The novel coronavirus disease (namely COVID-19) has taken attention because of its deadliness across the globe, causing a massive death as well as critical situation around the world. It is an infectious disease which is caused by newly discovered coronavirus. Our study demonstrates with a nonlinear model of this devastating COVID-19 which narrates transmission from human-to-human in the society. Pontryagins Maximum principle has also been applied in order to obtain optimal control strategies where the maintenance of social distancing is the major control. The target of this study is to find out the most fruitful control measures of averting coronavirus infection and eventually, curtailed of the COVID-19 transmission among people. The model is investigated analytically by using most familiar necessary conditions of Pontryagins maximum principle. Furthermore, numerical simulations have been performed to illustrate the analytical results. The analysis reveals that implementation of educational campaign, social distancing and developing human immune system are the major factors which can be able to plunge the scenario of becoming infected.","Biswas, M.

12450,Disease severity dictates SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibody responses in COVID-19,"COVID-19 patients exhibit differential disease severity after SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is currently unknown as to the correlation between the magnitude of neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses and the disease severity in COVID-19 patients. In a cohort of 59 recovered patients with disease severity including severe, moderate, mild and asymptomatic, we observed the positive correlation between serum neutralizing capacity and disease severity, in particular, the highest NAb capacity in sera from the patients with severe disease, while a lack of ability of asymptomatic patients to mount competent NAbs. Furthermore, the compositions of NAb subtypes were also different between recovered patients with severe symptoms and with mild-to-moderate symptoms. These results reveal the tremendous heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAb responses and their correlations to disease severity, highlighting the needs of future vaccination in COVID-19 patients recovered from asymptomatic or mild illness.","Chen, X.; Pan, Z.; Yue, S.; Yu, F.; Zhang, J.; Yang, Y.; Li, R.; Liu, B.; Yang, X.; Gao, L.; Li, Z.; Lin, Y.; Huang, Q.; Xu, L.; Tang, J.; Hu, L.; Zhao, J.; Liu, P.; Zhang, G.; Chen, Y.; Deng, K.; Ye, L.",2020-07-30,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.07.29.20164285,1,Lilin Ye,Third Military Medical University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.20164285v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.20164285v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1038/s41392-020-00301-9
8103,The Outcome Impact of Early vs Late HFNC Oxygen Therapy in Elderly Patients with COVID-19 and ARDS,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide. High-flow nasal cannula therapy (HFNC) is a major oxygen supporting therapy for severely ill patients, but information regarding the timing of HFNC application is scarce, especially in elderly patients. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 110 elderly patients ([&ge;]65 years) who received HFNC from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Peoples Hospital of Xiantao City and Chinese Medicine Hospital of Shishou City in Hubei Province, China, and from Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Peoples Hospital of Yangjiang City, Peoples Hospital of Maoming City in Guangdong Province, China.

Of the 110 patients, the median age was 71 years (IQR, 68-78) and 59.1% was male. Thirty-eight patients received HFNC when 200 mmHg < PO2/FiO2 [&le;] 300 mmHg (early HFNC group), and 72 patients received HFNC treatment when 100 mmHg < PaO2/FiO2 [&le;] 200 mmHg (late HFNC group). Compared with the late HFNC group, patients in the early HFNC group had a lower likelihood of developing severe ARDS, longer time from illness onset to severe ARDS and shorter duration of viral shedding after illness onset, as well as shorter lengths of ICU and hospital stay. Twenty-four patients died during hospitalization, of whom 22 deaths (30.6%) were in the late HFNC group and 2(5.3%) in the early HFNC group. It is concluded that the Prognosis was better in severely ill elderly patients with COVID-19 receiving early compared to late HFNC. This suggests HFNC could be considered early in this disease process.","Deng, L.; Lei, S.; Jiang, F.; Lubarsky, D. A.; Zhang, L.; Liu, D.; Han, C.; Zhou, D.; Wang, Z.; Sun, X.; Zhang, Y.; Cheung, C.

18055,Effectiveness of Second Wave COVID-19 Response Strategies in Australia,"BackgroundThere is a significant challenge in responding to second waves of COVID-19 cases, with governments being hesitant in introducing hard lockdown measures given the resulting economic impact. In addition, rising case numbers reflect an increase in coronavirus transmission some time previously, so timing of response measures is highly important. Australia experienced a second wave from June 2020 onwards, confined to greater Melbourne, with initial social distancing measures failing to reduce rapidly increasing case numbers. We conducted a detailed analysis of this outbreak, together with an evaluation of the effectiveness of alternative response strategies, to provide guidance to countries experiencing second waves of SARS-Cov-2 transmission.

MethodAn individual-based transmission model was used to 1) describe a second-wave COVID-19 epidemic in Australia; 2) evaluate the impact of lockdown strategies used; and 3) evaluate effectiveness of alternative mitigation strategies. The model was calibrated using daily diagnosed case data prior to lockdown. Specific social distancing interventions were modelled by adjusting person-to-person contacts in mixing locations.

ResultsModelling earlier activation of lockdown measures are predicted to reduce total case numbers by more than 50%. Epidemic peaks and duration of the second wave were also shown to reduce. Our results suggest that activating lockdown measures when second-wave case numbers first indicated exponential growth, would have been highly effective in reducing COVID-19 cases. The model was shown to realistically predict the epidemic growth rate under the social distancing measures applied, validating the methods applied.

ConclusionsThe timing of social distancing activation is shown to be critical to their effectiveness. Data showing exponential rise in cases, doubling every 7-10 days, can be used to trigger early lockdown measures. Such measures are shown to be necessary to reduce daily and total case numbers, and the consequential health burden, so preventing health care facilities being overwhelmed. Early control of second wave resurgence potentially permits strict lockdown measures to be eased earlier.

19372,"The impact of working during the Covid-19 pandemic on health care workers and first responders: mental health, function, and professional retention","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected front line health care workers (HCW) and first responders (FR). The infection risk from SARS CoV-2, the high mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the duration of the pandemic have created sustained and often traumatic stressors affecting HCW and FR.

ObjectivesTo assess the relationship of COVID-19 stressor frequency scores to psychiatric rating scale scores amongst HCW and FR. To determine if psychiatric rating scale scores mediate stressor effects on perceived work function and likelihood of remaining in current occupation.

DesignObservational, self-report in a convenience sample.

Participants118 HCW and FR caring for COVID-19 patients in the United States.

Main MeasureCOVID-19 related stressor frequencies were assessed using a 17-item questionnaire. Psychiatric symptoms were assessed with the PTSD Checklist 5 (PCL5), the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (for depression) (PHQ9), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD7).

Key ResultsStressor frequency scores correlated significantly with PCL5 scores (R=.57, p<1e-8), PHQ scores (R=.35, P<.001), ISI scores (R=.38, p<1e-4), and GAD7 scores (R=.39, p<.001), likelihood of staying in current occupation (R=-.39,p<1e-4), and trouble doing usual work (R=.33,p<.001). 51% of HCW and 44% of FR indicated decreased likelihood of staying in their current occupation. PCL5 scores substantially mediated the association between stress frequency scores and work function impairment.

ConclusionsThese results direct attention to recognizing potentially treatable psychiatric symptoms, particularly those of PTSD, in HCW and FR experiencing COVID-19 related stressors. They also suggest that mitigating COVID-19 related stressors when possible, such as by providing adequate personal protective equipment, can improve HCW and FR mental health, work function and retention in the health care work force.

17960,COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and resistance: Correlates in a nationally representative longitudinal survey of the Australian population,"BackgroundHigh levels of vaccination coverage in populations will be required even with vaccines that have high levels of effectiveness to prevent and stop outbreaks of coronavirus. The World Health Organisation has suggested that governments take a proactive response to vaccine hesitancy  hotspots based on social and behavioural insights.

MethodsRepresentative longitudinal online survey of over 3000 adults from Australia that examines the demographic, attitudinal, political and social attitudes and COVID-19 health behavior correlates of vaccine hesitance and resistance to a COVID-19 vaccine.

ResultsOverall, 59% would definitely get the vaccine, 29% had low levels of hesitancy, 7% had high levels of hesitancy and 6% were resistant. Females, those living in disadvantaged areas, those who reported that risks of COVID-19 was overstated, those who had more populist views and higher levels of religiosity were more likely to be hesitant or resistant while those who had higher levels of household income, those who had higher levels of social distancing, who downloaded the COVID-Safe App, who had more confidence in their state or territory government or confidence in their hospitals, or were more supportive of migration were more likely to intend to get vaccinated.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest that vaccine hesitancy, which accounts for a significant proportion of the population can be addressed by public health messaging but for a significant minority of the population with strongly held beliefs, alternative policy measures may well be needed to achieve sufficient vaccination coverage to end the pandemic.","Edwards, B.; Biddle, N.; Gray, M.; Sollis, K.",2020-11-26,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.11.13.20231480,2,Ben Edwards,Australian National University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.13.20231480v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.13.20231480v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
15144,Seroprevalence of Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in US Blood Donors,"Background To identify blood donors eligible to donate Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Convalescent Plasma (CCP), a large blood center began testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19. We report the seroprevalence of total immunoglobulin directed against the S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in US blood donors. Methods Unique non-CCP donor sera from June 1-July 31, 2020 were tested with the Ortho VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total immunoglobulin assay (positive: signal-to-cutoff (S/C) =>1). Donor age, sex, race/ethnicity, ABO/RhD, education, and experience were compared to June and July 2019. Multivariate regressions were conducted to identify demographics associated with the presence of antibodies and with S/C values. Results Unique donors (n=252,882) showed an overall seroprevalence of 1.83% in June (1.37%) and July (2.26%), with the highest prevalence in northern New Jersey (7.3%). In a subset of donors with demographic information (n=189,565), higher odds of antibody reactivity were associated with non-Hispanic Native American/Alaskan (NH-NAA/A) and Black (NH-B), and Hispanic (H) race/ethnicity, age 18-64, middle school or lesser education, blood Group A, and never or non-recent donor status. In positive donors (n=2,831), antibody signal was associated with male sex, race/ethnicity (NH-NAA/A, NH-B and H) and geographic location. Conclusions Seroprevalence remains low in US blood donors but varies significantly by region. Temporal trends in reactivity may be used to gauge the effectiveness of public health measures. Before generalizing these data from healthy donors to the general population however, rates must be corrected for false positive test results among low prevalence test subjects and adjusted to match the wider demography.","Vassallo, R.

2694,Machine Learning the Phenomenology of COVID-19 From Early Infection Dynamics,"We present a robust data-driven machine learning analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic from its early infection dynamics, specifically infection counts over time. The goal is to extract actionable public health insights. These insights include the infectious force, the rate of a mild infection becoming serious, estimates for asymtomatic infections and predictions of new infections over time. We focus on USA data starting from the first confirmed infection on January 20 2020. Our methods reveal significant asymptomatic (hidden) infection, a lag of about 10 days, and we quantitatively confirm that the infectious force is strong with about a 0.14% transition from mild to serious infection. Our methods are efficient, robust and general, being agnostic to the specific virus and applicable to different populations or cohorts.","Magdon-Ismail, M.",2020-04-10,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.03.17.20037309,3,Malik Magdon-Ismail,Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037309v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037309v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
6953,Patterns of COVID-19 related excess mortality in the municipalities of Northern Italy,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spatial distribution in Italy is inhomogeneous, because of its ways of spreading from the initial hotspots. The impact of COVID-19 on mortality has been described at the regional level, while less is known about mortality in demographic subgroups within municipalities.

We aimed to describe the excess mortality (EM) due to COVID-19 in the three most affected Italian regions, by estimating EM in subgroups defined by gender and age classes within each municipality from February 23 to March 31, 2020.

EM varied widely among municipalities even within the same region; it was similar between genders for the [&ge;]75 age group, while in the other age groups it was higher in males. Thus, nearby municipalities may show a different mortality burden despite being under common regional health policies, possibly as a result of policies adopted both at the regional and at the municipality level.","Gibertoni, D.; Adja, K.

12027,Country distancing reveals the effectiveness of travel restrictions during COVID-19,"Travel restrictions are the current central strategy to globally stop the transmission of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Despite remarkably successful approaches in predicting the spatiotemporal patterns of the ongoing pandemic, we lack an intrinsic understanding of the travel restrictions effectiveness. We fill this gap by developing a surprisingly simple measure, country distancing, that is analogical to the effective resistance in series and parallel circuits and captures the propagation backbone tree from the outbreak locations globally. This approach enables us to map the effectiveness of travel restrictions to arrival time delay (ATD) or infected case reduction (ICR) systematically. Our method estimates that 50.8% of travel restrictions as of Apr-4 are ineffective, resulting in zero ATD or ICR worldwide. Instead, by imposing Hubeis lockdown on Jan-23 and national lockdown on Feb-8, mainland China alone leads to 11.66 [95% credible interval (CI), 9.71 to 13.92] days of ATD per geographic area and 1,012,233 (95% CI, 208,210 -4,959,094) ICR in total as of Apr-4. Our result unveils the trade-off between the country distancing increase and economic loss, offering practical guidance for strategic actsion about when and where to implement travel restrictions, tailed to the real-time national context.","Zhong, L.; Diagne, M.; Wang, W.; Gao, J.",2020-07-24,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.24.20160994,1,Jianxi Gao,Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.20160994v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.20160994v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
19200,Development And Performance Evaluation of A Rapid In-House ELISA for Retrospective Serosurveillance of SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundIn the ongoing pandemic situation of COVID-19, serological tests can complement the molecular diagnostic methods, and can be one of the important tools of sero-surveillance and vaccine evaluation.

AimTo develop and evaluate a rapid SARS-CoV-2 specific ELISA for detection of anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG from patients biological samples.

MethodsIn order to develop the ELISA, three panels of samples (n=184) have been used: panel 1 (n=19) and panel 2 (n=60) were collected from RT-PCR positive patients within 14 and after 14 days of onset of clinical symptoms respectively, whereas panel 3 consisted of negative samples (n=105) collected either from healthy donors or pre-pandemic dengue patients. As a capturing agent full-length SARS-CoV2 specific recombinant nucleocapsid was immobilized. Commercial SARS-CoV2 IgG kit based on chemiluminescent assay was used for the selection of samples and optimization of the assay. The threshold cut-off point, inter-assay and intra-assay variations were determined. The total assay time for this in-house ELISA was set for 30 minutes.

ResultsThe assay time was set at a total of 30 minutes with the sensitivity of 84% (95% confidence interval, CI, 60.4%, 96.6%) and 98% (95% CI, 91.1%, 100.0%), for panel 1 and 2 respectively, with over all 94.9% sensitivity (95% CI 87.5%, 98.6%). Moreover, the clinical specificity is 97.1% (95% CI, 91.9%, 99.4%) with no cross reaction with dengue sample. The overall positive and negative predictive values are 96.2% (95% CI 89.2%, 99.2%) and 96.2% (95% CI, 90.6% 99.0%) respectively. In-house ELISA demonstrated 100% positive and negative percent agreement with ROCHE (Elecsys; Anti-SARS-CoV-2), with a Cohens kappa value of 1.00 (very strong agreement), while comparing 13 positive and 17 negative confirmed cases.

ConclusionThe assay is rapid and can be applied as one of the early and retrospective sero-monitoring tools in all over the affected areas.","Sil, B. K.; Oishee, M. J.; Haq, M.

11942,Central Nervous System Manifestations in COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"BackgroundAt the end of December 2019, a novel respiratory infection, initially reported in China, known as COVID-19 initially reported in China, and later known as COVID-19, led to a global pandemic. Despite many studies reporting respiratory infections as the primary manifestations of this illness, an increasing number of investigations have focused on the central nervous system (CNS) manifestations in COVID-19. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the CNS presentations in COVID-19 patients in an attempt to identify the common CNS features and provide a better overview to tackle this new pandemic.

MethodsIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Ovid, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Included studies were publications that reported the CNS features between January 1st, 2020, to April 20th, 2020. The data of selected studies were screened and extracted independently by four reviewers. Extracted data analyzed by using STATA statistical software. The study protocol registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020184456).

ResultsOf 2353 retrieved studies, we selected 64 studies with 11282 patients after screening. Most of the studies were conducted in China (58 studies). The most common CNS symptom of COVID-19 were Headache (8.69%, 95%CI: 6.76%-10.82%), Dizziness (5.94%, 95%CI: 3.66%-8.22%), and Impaired consciousness (1.9%, 95%CI: 1%-2.79%).

ConclusionsThe growing number of studies have reported COVID-19, CNS presentations as remarkable manifestations that happen. Hence, understanding the CNS characteristics of COVID-19 can help us for better diagnosis and ultimately prevention of worse outcomes.","Nazari, S.; Azari Jafari, A.; Mirmoeeni, S.; Sadeghian, S.; Heidari, M.

21020,The Experience of Two Independent Schools with In-Person Learning During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"BACKGROUNDIn 2020, U.S schools closed due to SARS-CoV-2 but their role in transmission was unknown. In fall 2020, national guidance for reopening omitted testing or screening recommendations. We report the experience of 2 large independent K-12 schools (School-A and School-B) that implemented an array of SARS-CoV-2 mitigation strategies that included periodic universal testing.

METHODSSARS-CoV-2 was identified through periodic universal PCR testing, self-reporting of tests conducted outside school, and contact tracing. Schools implemented behavioral and structural mitigation measures, including mandatory masks, classroom disinfecting, and social distancing.

RESULTSOver the fall semester, School-A identified 112 cases in 2320 students and staff; School-B identified 25 cases (2.0%) in 1200 students and staff. Most cases were asymptomatic and none required hospitalization. Of 69 traceable introductions, 63(91%) were not associated with school-based transmission, 59 cases (54%) occurred in the 2 weeks post-Thanksgiving. In 6/7 clusters, clear noncompliance with mitigation protocols was found. The largest outbreak had 28 identified cases and was traced to an off-campus party. There was no transmission from students to staff.

CONCLUSIONSAlthough school-age children can contract and transmit SARS-CoV-2, rates of COVID-19 infection related to in-person education were significantly lower than those in the surrounding community. However, social activities among students outside of school undermined those measures and should be discouraged, perhaps with behavioral contracts, to ensure the safety of school communities. In addition, introduction risks were highest following extended school breaks. These risks may be mitigated with voluntary quarantines and surveillance testing prior to re-opening.","Gillespie, D.

The majority of infected individuals have experienced no or only mild symptoms, ranging from fully asymptomatic cases to mild pneumonic disease. However, a minority of infected individuals develop severe respiratory symptoms. The objective of this study was to identify susceptible HLA alleles and clinical markers for the early identification of severe COVID-19 among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A total of 137 patients with mild COVID-19 (mCOVID-19) and 53 patients with severe COVID-19 (sCOVID-19) were recruited from the Center Hospital of the National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM), Tokyo, Japan for the period of February-August 2020.

10298,Clinical Characteristics in Children and Adolescents with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Experience in a highly complex Public Hospital in the city of Sao Paulo,"ObjectiveFaced with the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the real impact of the disease on children and adolescents and the behavior of the disease in this population are questioned. This study aims to assess the clinical characteristics of children and adolescents with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the effectiveness of the measures adopted at the institution.

MethodsThis is a prospective study carried out from 11/04/2020 to 19/06/2020. Investigated 346 patients between zero and eighteen years old, with analysis of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR, obtained from a nasopharynx and oropharynx swab, attended at a highly complex public pediatric hospital in the city of Sao Paulo.

Protocols for clinical management and treatment of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were adopted during the assistance and implementation of a preoperative screening protocol. They were evaluated according to sex, age, epidemiology, presence of comorbidities, clinical manifestations, therapy used, need for hospitalization in the ward and ICU, use of mechanical ventilation (MV) and evolution.

Results66 confirmed patients with COVID 19 were identified. Median age was 7 years old, with the male gender predominant (2:1). 27 patients (40.9%) had contact with symptomatic respiratory individuals, comorbidity occurred in 50 cases (75.8%). Main clinical manifestations were: fever, 37 patients (56.1%); cough, 23 (34.8%); respiratory distress in 10 (15.2%) and gastrointestinal symptoms in 24 (36.4%). 38 patients (57.6%) received antibiotics and 13 (19.7%) received corticotherapy. 37 patients (56.1%) required hospitalization, eight (19.5%) in the ICU and six (75%) requiring MV. One death occurred and others with good evolution.

ConclusionThis study corroborates the perception that the pediatric patient has a more benign manifestation, even in the presence of comorbidities, requiring the screening of surgical patients. The protocol adopted by the institution proved to be effective, with no contamination being observed among patients or between patients and collaborators.","Vieira, R. S. R.; Aguiar, E. L.

Cell-phone mobility data offers a modern measurement instrument to investigate human mobility and behavior at an unprecedented scale. We investigate mobility data collected, aggregated, and anonymized by SafeGraph Inc. which measures how populations at the census-block-group geographic scale stayed at home in California, Georgia, Texas, and Washington since the beginning of the pandemic. Using manifold learning techniques, we find patterns of mobility behavior that align with stay-at-home orders, correlate with socioeconomic factors, cluster geographically, and reveal sub-populations that likely migrated out of urban areas. The analysis and approach provides policy makers a framework for interpreting mobility data and behavior to inform actions aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19.","Levin, R.; Chao, D.

8694,Rapid point of care nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalised patients: a clinical trial and implementation study,"BackgroundThere is urgent need for safe and efficient triage protocols for hospitalized COVID-19 suspects to appropriate isolation wards. A major barrier to timely discharge of patients from the emergency room and hospital is the turnaround time for many SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests. We validated a point of care nucleic acid amplification based platform SAMBA II for diagnosis of COVID-19 and performed an implementation study to assess its impact on patient disposition at a major academic hospital.

MethodsWe prospectively recruited COVID-19 suspects admitted to hospital (NCT04326387). In an initial pilot phase, individuals were tested using a nasal/throat swab with the SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 rapid diagnostic platform in parallel with a combined nasal/throat swab for standard central laboratory RT-PCR testing. In the second implementation phase, we examined the utility of adding the SAMBA platform to routine care. In the pilot phase, we measured concordance and assay validity using the central laboratory as the reference standard and assessed assay turnaround time. In the implementation phase, we assessed 1) time to definitive bed placement from admission, 2) time spent on COVID-19 holding wards, 3) proportion of patients in isolation versus COVID negative areas following a test, comparing the implementation phase with the 10 days prior to implementation.

ResultsIn phase I, 149 participants were included in the pilot. By central laboratory RT-PCR testing, 32 (21.5%) tested positive and 117 (78.5%). Sensitivity and specificity of the SAMBA assay compared to RT-PCR lab test were 96.9% (95% CI 0.838-0.999) and 99.1% (0.953-0.999), respectively. Median time to result was 2.6 hours (IQR 2.3 to 4.8) for SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 test and 26.4 hours (IQR 21.4 to 31.4) for the standard lab RT-PCR test (p<0.001). In the first 10 days of the SAMBA implementation phase, we conducted 992 tests, with the majority (59.8%) used for hospital admission, and the remainder for pre-operative screening (11.3%), discharge planning (10%), in-hospital screening of new symptoms (9.7%). Comparing the pre-implementation (n=599) with the implementation phase, median time to definitive bed placement from admission was reduced from 23.4 hours (8.6-41.9) to 17.1 hours (9.0-28.8), P=0.02 in Cox analysis, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities and clinical severity at presentation. Mean length of stay on a COVID-19  holding ward decreased from 58.5 hours to 29.9 hours (P<0.001). Use of single occupancy rooms amongst those tested fell from 30.8% before to 21.2% (P=0.03) and 11 hospital bay closures (on average 6 beds each) were avoided after implementation of the POC assay.

ConclusionsThe SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 rapid assay performed well compared to a centralized laboratory RT-PCR platform and demonstrated shorter time to result both in trial and real-world settings. It was also associated with faster time to definitive bed placement from the emergency room, greater availability of isolation rooms, avoidance of hospital bay closures, and greater movement of patients to COVID negative open ""green"" category wards. Rapid testing in hospitals has the potential to transform ability to deal with the COVID-19 epidemic.","Collier, D. A.; Assennato, S.

Here I use age-stratified death count statistics, published age-dependent infection fatality risks and stochastic modeling to estimate the true prevalence and growth of COVID-19 infections among adults (age[&ge;] 20 years) in 161 countries, from early 2020 until November 1, 2020. My predictions are largely consistent with data from multiple previous nationwide seroprevalence surveys. As of November 1, 2020, the nationwide cumulative COVID-19 prevalence (past and current infections relative to the population size) is estimated at 31% (95%-CI 22-50) for Peru, 27% (17-41) for Mexico, 22% (14-34) for Brazil, 12% (7.2-20) for the US, 11% (6.4-18) for the United Kingdom, 8.2% (5.2-15) for France, 7.4% (4.9-13) for Sweden, 4.2% (2.5-6.8) for Canada, 1.8% (1.2-3) for Germany and 0.12% (0.074-0.26) for Japan.

7641,"COVID 19: Real-time Forecasts of Confirmed Cases, Active Cases, and Health Infrastructure Requirements for India and its States using the ARIMA model.","BackgroundCOVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease which has been declared a Pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th March 2020. The Indian public health care system is already overstretched, and this pandemic is making things even worse. That is why forecasting cases for India is necessary to meet the future demands of the health infrastructure caused due to COVID-19.

ObjectiveOur study forecasts the confirmed and active cases for COVID-19 until July mid, using time series Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. Additionally, we estimated the number of isolation beds, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds and ventilators required for the growing number of COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe used ARIMA model for forecasting confirmed and active cases till the 15th July. We used time-series data of COVID-19 cases in India from 14th March to 22nd May. We estimated the requirements for ICU beds as 10%, ventilators as 5% and isolation beds as 85% of the active cases forecasted using the ARIMA model.

ResultsOur forecasts indicate that India will have an estimated 7,47,772 confirmed cases (95% CI: 493943, 1001601) and 296,472 active cases (95% CI:196820, 396125) by 15th July. While Maharashtra will be the most affected state, having the highest number of active and confirmed cases, Punjab is expected to have an estimated 115 active cases by 15th July. India needs to prepare 2,52,001 isolation beds (95% CI: 167297, 336706), 29,647 ICU beds (95% CI: 19682, 39612), and 14,824 ventilator beds (95% CI: 9841, 19806).

ConclusionOur forecasts show an alarming situation for India, and Maharashtra in particular. The actual numbers can go higher than our estimated numbers as India has a limited testing facility and coverage.","Tyagi, R.; Bramhankar, M.; Pandey, M.; M, K.",2020-06-11,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.05.17.20104588,2,Rishabh Tyagi,International Institute for Population Sciences,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.17.20104588v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.17.20104588v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
6553,A Divide and Conquer Strategy against the Covid-19 Pandemic?!,"The concern about (socio-)economic consequences of collective lockdowns in the Covid-19 pandemic calls for alternative strategies. We consider a divide and conquer strategy in which a high risk group (HRG) is put on strict isolation, whereas the remainder of the population is exposed to the virus, building up immunity against Covid-19. The question is whether this strategy may suppress the effective reproduction number below the critical value of [Formula] without further lockdown once the HRG is released from isolation. While this proposal appears already rather academic, we show that [Formula] can only be obtained provided that the HRG is less than ~ 20 - 30% of the total population. Hence, this strategy is likely to fail in countries with a HRG larger than the given upper bound. In addition, we argue that the maximum infection rate occurring in this strategy is likely to exceed realistic capacities of most health care systems. While the conclusion is rather negative in this regard, we emphasise that the strategy of stopping the curve at an early stage of the Covid-19 pandemic has a chance to work out. The required duration of the lockdown is estimated to be {tau} ~ 14 days/[Formula] (up to some order one factor) for [Formula], provided a systematic tracing strategy of new infections exists for the subsequent relaxation phase. In this context we also argue why [Formula] remains the crucial parameter which needs to be accurately monitored and controlled.","Mangat, P.

12379,"Time-dependent heterogeneity leads to transient suppression of COVID-19 epidemic, not herd immunity","Epidemics generally spread through a succession of waves that reflect factors on multiple time-scales. On short time-scales, superspreading events lead to burstiness and overdispersion, while long-term persistent heterogeneity in susceptibility is expected to lead to a reduction in the infection peak and the herd immunity threshold (HIT). Here, we develop a general approach to encompass both time-scales, including time variations in individual social activity, and demonstrate how to incorporate them phenomenologically into a wide class of epidemiological models through parameterization. We derive a non-linear dependence of the effective reproduction number Re on the susceptible population fraction S. We show that a state of transient collective immunity (TCI) emerges well below the HIT during early, high-paced stages of the epidemic. However, this is a fragile state that wanes over time due to changing levels of social activity, and so the infection peak is not an indication of herd immunity: subsequent waves can and will emerge due to behavioral changes in the population, driven (e.g.) by seasonal factors. Transient and long-term levels of heterogeneity are estimated by using empirical data from the COVID-19 epidemic as well as from real-life face-to-face contact networks. These results suggest that the hardest-hit areas, such as NYC, have achieved TCI following the first wave of the epidemic, but likely remain below the long-term HIT. Thus, in contrast to some previous claims, these reqions can still experience subsequent waves.

O_TEXTBOXSignificance Statement

Epidemics generally spread through a succession of waves that reflect factors on multiple time-scales. Here, we develop a general approach to encompass super-spreading and population heterogeneity, and demonstrate that a fragile state of transient collective immunity (TCI) emerges well below the HIT during early, high-paced stages of the epidemic. However, this is not an indication of herd immunity: subsequent waves can and will emerge due to behavioral changes in the population, driven (e.g.) by seasonal factors. Analysis of empirical data suggests that even in locations with strong first waves of COVID-19, subsequent waves will still emerge.

12483,The basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2: a scoping review of available evidence,"BackgroundThe transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 determines both the ability of the virus to invade a population and the strength of intervention that would be required to contain or eliminate the spread of infection. The basic reproduction number, R0, provides a quantitative measure of the transmission potential of a pathogen.

ObjectiveConduct a scoping review of the available literature providing estimates of R0 for SARS-CoV-2, provide an overview of the drivers of variation in R0 estimates and the considerations taken in the calculation of the parameter.

DesignScoping review of available literature between the 01 December 2019 and 07 May 2020.

Data sourcesBoth peer-reviewed and pre-print articles were searched for on PubMed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv and BioRxiv.

Selection criteriaStudies were selected for review if (i) the estimation of R0 for SARS-CoV-2 represented either the initial stages of the outbreak or the initial stages of the outbreak prior to the onset of widespread population restriction (""lockdown""), (ii) the exact dates of the study period were provided and (iii) the study provided primary estimates of R0.

ResultsA total of 20 R0 for SARS-CoV-2 estimates were extracted from 15 studies. There was substantial variation in the estimates reported. Estimates derived from mathematical models fell within a wider range of 1.94-6.94 than statistical models which fell between the range of 2.2 to 4.4. Several studies made assumptions about the length of the infectious period which ranged from 5.8-20 days and the serial interval which ranged from 4.41-14 days. For a given set of parameters a longer duration of infectiousness or a longer serial interval equates to a higher R0. Several studies took measures to minimise bias in early case reporting, to account for the potential occurrence of super-spreading events, and to account for early sub-exponential epidemic growth.

ConclusionsThe variation in reported estimates of R0 reflects the complex nature of the parameter itself, including the context (i.e. social/spatial structure), the methodology used to estimate the parameter, and model assumptions. R0 is a fundamental parameter in the study of infectious disease dynamics, however it provides limited practical applicability outside of the context in which it was estimated, and should be calculated and interpreted with this in mind.

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE SCOPING REVIEWO_LIThis study provides an overview of basic reproduction number estimates for SARS-CoV-2 across a range of settings, a fundamental parameter in gauging the transmissibility of an emerging infectious disease.
C_LIO_LIThe key drivers of variation in R0 estimates and considerations in the calculation of the parameter highlighted across the reviewed studies are discussed.
C_LIO_LIThis evidence may be used to help inform modelling studies and intervention strategies.

3441,ACE2 and TMPRSS2 variants and expression as candidates to sex and country differences in COVID-19 severity in Italy,"BackgroundAs the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progresses, prognostic markers for early identification of high-risk individuals are an urgent medical need. Italy has the highest rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the highest number of deaths, and the highest mortality rate among large countries. Worldwide, a more severe course of COVID-19 is associated with older age, comorbidities, and male sex. Hence, we searched for possible genetic components of the peculiar severity of COVID-19 among Italians, by looking at expression levels and variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes, which are crucial for viral infection.

MethodsExome and SNP array data from a large Italian cohort representative of the countrys population were used to compare the burden of rare variants and the frequency of polymorphisms with European and East Asian populations. Moreover, we looked into gene expression databases to check for sex-unbalanced expression.

ResultsWhile we found no significant evidence that ACE2 is associated with disease severity/sex bias in the Italian population, TMPRSS2 levels and genetic variants proved to be possible candidate disease modulators, contributing to the observed epidemiological data among Italian patients.

ConclusionsOur analysis suggests a role for TMPRSS2 variants and expression levels in modulating COVID-19 severity, a hypothesis that fosters a rapid experimental validation on large cohorts of patients with different clinical manifestations.","Asselta, R.; Paraboschi, E.

11642,Longitudinal dynamics of the neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral agents for therapy. Little is known about the longitudinal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in COVID-19 patients.

MethodsBlood samples (n=173) were collected from 30 COVID-19 patients over a 3-month period after symptom onset and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs, using the lentiviral pseudotype assay, coincident with the levels of IgG and proinflammatory cytokines.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2-specific NAb titers were low for the first 7-10 d after symtom onset and increased after 2-3 weeks. The median peak time for NAbs was 33 d (IQR 24-59 d) after symptom onset. NAb titers in 93.3% (28/30) of the patients declined gradually over the 3-month study period, with a median decrease of 34.8% (IQR 19.6-42.4%). NAb titers increased over time in parallel with the rise in IgG antibody levels, correlating well at week 3 (r = 0.41, p < 0.05). The NAb titers also demonstrated a significant positive correlation with levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including SCF, TRAIL, and M-CSF.

ConclusionsThese data provide useful information regarding dynamic changes in NAbs in COVID-19 patients during the acute and convalescent phases.","Wang, K.; Long, Q.-X.; Deng, H.-J.; Hu, J.; Gao, Q.-Z.; Zhang, G.-J.; He, C.-L.; Huang, L.-Y.; Hu, J.-L.; Chen, J.; Tang, N.; Huang, A.-L.",2020-07-17,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.07.14.20151159,1,Ai-Long Huang,Chongqing Medical University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20151159v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20151159v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
3343,The diagnostic evaluation of Convolutional NeuralNetwork (CNN) for the assessment of chest X-ray ofpatients infected with COVID-19,"IntroductionThe main target of COVID-19 is the lungs where it may cause pneumonia in severely ill patients. Chest X-ray is an important diagnostic test to assess the lung for the damaging effects of COVID-19. Many other microbial pathogens can also cause damage to lungs leading to pneumonia but there are certain radiological features which can favor the diagnosis of pneumonia caused by COVID-19. With the rising number of cases of COVID-19, it would be imperative to develop computer programs which may assist the health professionals in the prevailing scenario.

Materials & MethodsA total of two hundred and seventy eight (278) images of chest X-rays have been assessed by applying ResNet-50 convolutional neural network architectures in the present study. The digital images were acquired from the public repositories provided by University of Montreal and National Institutes of Health. These digital images of Chest X-rays were divided into three groups labeled as normal, pneumonia and COVID-19. The third group contains digital images of chest X-rays of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection while the second group contains images of lung with pneumonia caused by other pathogens.

ResultsThe radiological images included in the data set are 89 images of lungs with COVID-19 infection, 93 images of lungs without any radiological abnormality and 96 images of patient with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. In this data set, 80% of the images were employed for training, and 20% for testing. A pre-trained (on ImageNet data set) ResNet-50 architecture was used to diagnose the cases of COVID-19 infections on lung X-ray images. The analysis of the data revealed that computer vision based program achieved diagnostic accuracy of 98.18 %, and F1-score of 98.19.

ConclusionThe performance of convolutional neural network regarding the differentiation of pulmonary changes caused by COVID-19 from the other type of pneumonias on digital images of the chest X-rays is excellent and it may be an extremely useful adjunct tool for the health professionals.","Bukhari, S.

3522,Computed Tomography Findings and Short-term follow-up with Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia,"ObjectiveTo assess the characteristics of computed tomography (CT) features and changes in CT monitoring in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).

MethodsIn this retrospective, two-center study, we reviewed the medical records of 57 patients with NCP in CT from January 21 to February 12, 2020. Cases were confirmed by the results of nucleic acid test positive, and were analyzed for demographic, clinical, and CT features.

ResultsOf the 57 patients, 31cases were male, and 45.6% were female. The average age was 46.5 {+/-} 15.8 years. Patients had fever (84.2%), cough (49.1%), weak (31.6%), muscle ache (17.5%), shortness of breath (12.3%). The distribution of abnormality was a subpleural lesions in 51 cases, with 96.5% ground-glass opacity (GGO) and 68.4% consolidation. Another observation reveals 45.6% fibrosis, 33.3% lymph node enlargement, 21.1% pleural thickening, 17.5% small nodule, 7.0% white lung, 5.3% emphysema, and 3.5% bronchiectasis. Importantly, the group of men had more septal thickening and air trapping than the female group (p<0.05); Compared with the younger, the elderly had higher of subpleural lesion, interlobular septal thickening and pleural thickening (p<0.05). In the first monitoring, there were 37.3% improvement, 60.8% progress. In the second monitoring, there were 55% improvement, 35% progress. The improvement rate during the third follow-up visit was 100%.

ConclusionsCT features and CT dynamic observation play a vital role in the diagnosis and treatment with NCP. It is conducive to early diagnosis, deepen the knowledge of NCP and accumulate experience.

Key pointsBilateral and subpleural regions on CT are common in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), which were more extensive GGOs than consolidation.

At CT, NCP shows GGOs without or with consolidation, which most of the patients appear interlobular interstitium thickening, vascular bundle thickening, air bronchogram, and fibrosis. In patients with fever in close contact with eruption areas of 2019-nCoV, familiarity with the CT findings may help with early diagnosis, early isolation, and management.","Qi, S.; Guo, H.; Shao, H.; Lan, S.; He, Y.; Tiheiran, M.; Li, H.",2020-04-04,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.02.20042614,1,Hongjun Li,"Beijing youan Hospital, Capital Medical University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20042614v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20042614v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

By combining phylogenetic data of 5,198 SARS-CoV-2 genomes with the chronology of non-pharmaceutical interventions in 57 countries, we examine how interventions and combinations thereof alter the divergence rate of viral lineages, which is directly related to the epidemic reproduction number. Home containment and education lockdown had the largest independent impacts and were predicted to reduce the reproduction number by 35% and 26%, respectively. However, we find that in contexts with a reproduction number >2, no individual intervention is sufficient to stop the epidemic and increasingly stringent intervention combinations may be required.

17622,Genetic variants are identified to increase risk of COVID-19 related mortality from UK Biobank data,"BackgroundThe severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly heterogenous. Studies have reported that males and some ethnic groups are at increased risk of death from COVID-19, which implies that individual risk of death might be influenced by host genetic factors.

MethodsIn this project, we consider the mortality as the trait of interest and perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of data for 1,778 infected cases (445 deaths, 25.03%) distributed by the UK Biobank. Traditional GWAS failed to identify any genome-wide significant genetic variants from this dataset. To enhance the power of GWAS and account for possible multi-loci interactions, we adopt the concept of super-variant for the detection of genetic factors. A discovery-validation procedure is used for verifying the potential associations.

ResultsWe find 8 super-variants that are consistently identified across multiple replications as susceptibility loci for COVID-19 mortality. The identified risk factors on Chromosomes 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 16, and 17 contain genetic variants and genes related to cilia dysfunctions (DNAH7 and CLUAP1), cardiovascular diseases (DES and SPEG), thromboembolic disease (STXBP5), mitochondrial dysfunctions (TOMM7), and innate immune system (WSB1). It is noteworthy that DNAH7 has been reported recently as the most downregulated gene after infecting human bronchial epithelial cells with SARS-CoV2.

ConclusionsEight genetic variants are identified to significantly increase risk of COVID-19 mortality among the patients with white British ancestry. These findings may provide timely evidence and clues for better understanding the molecular pathogenesis of COVID-19 and genetic basis of heterogeneous susceptibility, with potential impact on new therapeutic options.","Hu, J.; Li, C.; Wang, S.; Li, T.; Zhang, H.",2020-11-09,Genetic And Genomic Medicine,10.1101/2020.11.05.20226761,1,Heping Zhang,Yale University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.05.20226761v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.05.20226761v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

This study aimed to compare the accuracy and precision of wrist and forehead temperature with tympanic temperature under different circumstances.

MethodsWe performed a prospective observational study in a real-life population. We consecutively collected wrist and forehead temperatures in Celsius ({degrees}C) using a non-contact infrared thermometer (NCIT). We also measured the tympanic temperature using a tympanic thermometers (IRTT) and defined fever as a tympanic temperature [&ge;]37.3{degrees}C.

ResultsWe enrolled a total of 528 participants including 261 indoor and 267 outdoor participants.

Under different circumstance, the mean difference ranged from -1.72 to -0.56{degrees}C in different groups for the forehead measurements, and -0.96 to -0.61{degrees}C for the wrist measurements. Both measurements had high fever screening abilities in inpatients (wrist: AUC 0.790; 95% CI: 0.725-0.854, P <0.001; forehead: AUC 0.816; 95% CI: 0.757-0.876, P <0.001). The cut-off value of wrist measurement for detecting tympanic temperature [&ge;]37.3{degrees}C was 36.2{degrees}C with a 86.4% sensitivity and a 67.0% specificity, and the best threshold of forehead measurement was also 36.2{degrees}C with a 93.2% sensitivity and a 60.0% specificity.

ConclusionsWrist measurement is more stable than forehead measurement under different circumstance. Both measurements have great fever screening abilities for indoor patients. The cut-off value of both measurements was 36.2{degrees}C.

6032,COVID-19 in breast cancer patients: a cohort at the Institut Curie hospitals in the Paris area,"BackgroundCancer patients have been reported to be at higher risk of COVID-19 complications and deaths. We report the characteristics and outcome of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during breast cancer treatment at Institut Curie hospitals (ICH, Paris area, France).

MethodsAn IRB-approved prospective registry was set up at ICH on March 13th, 2020 for all breast cancer patients with COVID-19 symptoms or radiologic signs. Registered data included patient history, tumor characteristics and treatments, COVID-19 symptoms, radiological features and outcome. Data extraction was done on April 25th, 2020. COVID-19 patients were defined as those with either a positive RNA test or typical, newly appeared lung CT-scan abnormalities.

ResultsAmong 15,600 patients actively treated for early or metastatic breast cancer during the last 4 months at ICH, 76 patients with suspected COVID-19 infection were included in the registry and followed. Fifty-nine of these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on viral RNA testing (N=41) or typical radiologic signs: 37/59 (63%) COVID-19 patients were treated for metastatic breast cancer, and 13/59 (22%) of them were taking corticosteroids daily. Common clinical features mostly consisted of fever and/or cough, while ground-glass opacities were the most common radiologic sign at diagnosis. We found no association between prior radiation therapy fields or extent of radiation therapy sequelae and extent of COVID-19 lung lesions. Twenty-eight of these 59 patients (47%) were hospitalized and 6 (10%) were transferred to an intensive care unit. At the time of analysis, 45/59 (76%) patients were recovering or had been cured, 10/59 (17%) were still followed and 4/59 (7%) had died from COVID-19. All 4 patients who died had significant non-cancer comorbidities. In univariate analysis, hypertension and age (>70) were the two factors associated with a higher risk of intensive care unit admission and/or death.

ConclusionsThis prospective registry analysis suggests that the COVID-19 mortality rate in breast cancer patients depends more on comorbidities than prior radiation therapy or current anti-cancer treatment. Special attention must be paid to comorbidities when estimating the risk of severe COVID-19 in breast cancer patients.","Vuagnat, P.; Frelaut, M.; Ramtohul, T.; Basse, C.; Diakite, S.; Noret, A.; Bellesoeur, A.; Servois, V.; Hequet, D.; Laas, E.; Kirova, Y.; Cabel, L.; Pierga, J.-Y.; Institut Curie Breast Cancer And Covid Group,  ; Bozec, L.; Paoletti, X.; Cottu, P.; Bidard, F.-C.",2020-05-19,Oncology,10.1101/2020.04.30.20085928,2,Perrine Vuagnat,Institut Curie,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.30.20085928v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.30.20085928v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1186/s13058-020-01293-8
17760,Can we predict the severe course of COVID-19? A systematic review and meta-analysis of indicators of clinical outcome.,"BackgroundCOVID-19 has been reported in over 40million people globally with variable clinical outcomes. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed demographic, laboratory and clinical indicators as predictors for severe courses of COVID-19.

MethodsWe systematically searched multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, MedRvix and bioRvix) for publications from December 2019 to May 31st 2020. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate pooled odds ratios and differences of medians between (1) patients admitted to ICU versus non-ICU patients and (2) patients who died versus those who survived. We adapted an existing Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool for outcome studies.

ResultsOf 6,702 unique citations, we included 88 articles with 69,762 patients. There was concern for bias across all articles included. Age was strongly associated with mortality with a difference of medians (DoM) of 13.15 years (95% confidence interval (CI) 11.37 to 14.94) between those who died and those who survived. We found a clinically relevant difference between non-survivors and survivors for C-reactive protein (CRP; DoM 69.10, CI 50.43 to 87.77), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; DoM 189.49, CI 155.00 to 223.98), cardiac troponin I (cTnI; DoM 21.88, CI 9.78 to 33.99) and D-Dimer (DoM 1.29mg/L, CI 0.9 - 1.69). Furthermore, cerebrovascular disease was the co-morbidity most strongly associated with mortality (Odds Ratio 3.45, CI 2.42 to 4.91) and ICU admission (Odds Ratio 5.88, CI 2.35 to 14.73).

DiscussionThis comprehensive meta-analysis found age, cerebrovascular disease, CRP, LDH and cTnI to be the most important risk-factors in predicting severe COVID-19 outcomes and will inform decision analytical tools to support clinical decision-making.

SummaryIn this systematic review we meta-analyzed 88 articles for risk factors of ICU admission and mortality in COVID-19. We found age, cerebrovascular disease, CRP, LDH and cTnI are the most important risk-factors for ICU admission or mortality.","Katzenschlager, S.; Zimmer, A.

7949,Oscillatory dynamics in infectivity and death rates of COVID-19,"The analysis of systematically collected data for COVID-19 infectivity and death rates has revealed in many countries around the world a typical oscillatory pattern with a 7-days (circaseptan) period. Additionally, in some countries the 3.5-days (hemicircaseptan) and 14-days periodicities have been also observed. Interestingly, the 7-days infectivity and death rates oscillations are almost in phase, showing local maxima on Thursdays/Fridays and local minima on Sundays/Mondays. These observations are in stark contrast with a known pattern, correlating the death rate with the reduced medical staff in hospitals on the weekends. One possible hypothesis addressing these observations is that they reflect a gradually increasing stress with the progressing week, which can trigger the maximal death rates observed on Thursdays/Fridays. Moreover, assuming the weekends provide the likely time for new infections, the maximum number of new cases might fall again on Thursdays/Fridays. These observations deserve further study to provide better understanding of the COVID-19 dynamics.","Pavlicek, T.; Rehak, P.; Kral, P.",2020-06-01,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.19.20107474,2,Petr Kral,University of Illinois at Chicago,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20107474v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20107474v2.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1128/msystems.00700-20
4331,A High-Coverage SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequence Acquired by Target Capture Sequencing,"This manuscript is based on the method we developed urgently to deal with the research requirement in the conflict between achieving a complete genome sequence for the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 study and the low viral RNA concentration. Here, in this manuscript, we developed a set of SARS-CoV-2 enrichment probes to increase the sensitivity of sequence-based virus detection and characterization via obtaining the comprehensive genome sequence. Following the CDC health and safety guidelines, we test the concept using the culturing supernatant contain SARS-CoV-2 particles, and its full-length sequence was used for further analysis. The fraction of SARS-CoV-2 endogenous DNA was 93.47% with Cluster Factor about 1.1, which demonstrate that the numbers of mapped reads to SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence significantly increased, compared to metagenomic sequencing technology, following SARS-CoV-2 probe enrichment. Moreover, based on the high-quality sequence, we discussed the heterozygosity and viral expression during replication of coronavirus, and its phylogenetic relationship with other selected high-quality samples from The Genome Variation Map (GVM) (on 2020/03/22). We believe this manuscript is valuable for all the researchers who are interested in using clinical warp samples to obtain the high coverage of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence with a relatively low concentration of viral particles. This would allow the clinician to correlate the diagnostic data with molecular monitoring in viral evolutional, the most importantly, to track the functional mutation of SARS-CoV-2.","Wen, S.; Zhang, X.",2020-04-15,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.11.20061507,1,Shaoqing Wen,Fudan University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20061507v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20061507v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1002/jmv.26116
16940,Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibodies in the Staff of a Public School System in the Midwestern United States,"BackgroundSince March 2020, the United States has lost over 200,000 lives to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19. A growing body of literature describes population-level SARS-CoV-2 exposure, but studies of antibody seroprevalence within school systems are critically lacking, hampering evidence-based discussions on school reopenings. The Lake Central School Corporation (LCSC), a public school system in suburban Indiana, USA, assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in its staff and identified correlations between seropositivity and subjective histories and demographics.

MethodsThis study is a cross-sectional, population-based analysis of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in LCSC staff measured in July 2020. We tested for seroprevalence with the Abbott Alinity SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test. The primary outcome was the total seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, and secondary outcomes included trends of antibody presence in relation to baseline attributes.

Findings753 participants representative of the staff at large were enrolled. 22 participants (2{middle dot}9%, 95% CI: 1{middle dot}8% - 4{middle dot}4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Correcting for test performance parameters, the seroprevalence is estimated at 1{middle dot}7% (90% Credible Interval: 0{middle dot}27% - 3{middle dot}3%). Multivariable logistic regression including mask wearing, travel history, symptom history, and contact history revealed a 48-fold increase in the odds of seropositivity if an individual previously tested positive for COVID-19 (OR: 48.2, 95% CI: 4 - 600). Amongst individuals with no previous positive test, exposure to a person diagnosed with COVID-19 increased the odds of seropositivity by 7-fold (OR: 6.5, 95% CI: 2.06 - 18.9).

InterpretationAssuming the presence of antibodies is associated with immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection, these results demonstrate a broad lack of herd immunity amongst the school corporations staff irrespective of employment role or location. Protective measures like contact tracing face coverings, and social distancing are therefore vital to maintaining the safety of both students and staff as the school year progresses.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed, SSRN, Research Square, and Gale Power Search for peer-reviewed articles, preprints, and research reports on the seroprevalence of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG antibodies, published in English, using the search terms ""COVID-19 in schools,"" ""COVID-19 seroprevalence,"" ""COVID antibodies,"" and similar terms up to August 30, 2020. We identified several articles pertaining to the spread of COVID-19 within schools and among children. Current evidence on the pediatric transmission of COVID-19 is mixed, but early data on secondary school transmission are sobering. Shared among this literature was an acknowledgement of the paucity of data regarding how the pandemic may progress in the students and staff of primary and secondary education systems. To our knowledge, there is no study that specifically interrogates the seroprevalence of COVID-19 among US public school staff.

Added value of this studyAs of September 2020, the United States has had more COVID-19 cases than any other country. With many US schools opening for in-person classes for the 2020-2021 school year, a granular understanding of the transmission dynamics within public school systems is vital to effectively and appropriately defending against COVID-19. Most seroprevalence studies have been based on city or hospital-level populations; this study establishes a baseline seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a Midwest public school district prior to the initiation of the school year.

Implications of all available evidenceThe results of this study reveal that the majority (98{middle dot}3%) of LCSC staff have not been exposed to COVID-19 prior to the start of the school year. Staff are therefore vulnerable to a large outbreak after the school opens, underscoring the importance of maintaining rigorous sanitary practices within the schools. It is vital that all members of LCSC and similar school districts across the country continue social distancing and mask wearing throughout the school day to limit exposure to COVID-19. Contact tracing in combination with rapid testing for individuals exposed to an individual with COVID-19 should also be employed.","Lopez, L.; Weber, G.; Nguyen, T.; Kleimola, K.; Bereda, M.; Liu, Y.; Accorsi, E.

4534,The end of the social confinement in Spain and the COVID-19 re-emergence risk,"After the spread of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic out of China, the world approaches the 2 million declared infected cases and death toll rises well above the 100 thousand. The course of pandemic evolution has shown great differences among countries and not much is yet known about the level of generated immunity, which might appear not to be long-lasting. In this situation, management of a recurrent disease seems to be a plausible scenario that countries worldwide will have to face, before effective drugs or a vaccine appear. Spain in Europe, appears to be the first country deciding to partly lift the strict social distancing regulations imposed. Whether this action may lead to further epidemic recrudescence, to a following second wave of cases or conversely, help return to previous normality, is a subject of great debate and interest to all other countries affected by COVID-19. Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we had also incorporated effects of social confinement. We now modify this previous model configuration to mimic potential post-confinement scenarios, by simulating from instant massive liberation of different portions of the confined population, up to a more gradual incorporation of people to work. Results show how current lockdown conditions should be extended at least two weeks more to prevent a new escalation in cases and deaths, as well as a larger second wave occurring in just a few months. Conversely, best-case scenario in terms of lower COVID-19 incidence and casualties should gradually incorporate workers back in a daily proportion at most 30 percent higher than that of previous confinement. The former should begin not earlier than by the end of April and it would represent approximately 600 thousand people or a 3.75% rate for the whole of Spain.","Lopez, L.; Rodo, X.",2020-04-17,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.14.20064766,1,Leonardo Lopez,ISGlobal,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20064766v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20064766v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
18770,"A Novel Model for Simulating COVID-19 Dynamics Through Layered Infection States that Integrate Concepts from Epidemiology, Biophysics and Medicine: SEI3R2S-Nrec","IntroductionEffectively modeling SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 dynamics requires careful integration of population health (public health motivation) and recovery dynamics (medical interventions motivation). This manuscript proposes a minimal pandemic model, which conceptually separates ""complex adaptive systems"" (CAS) associated with social behavior and infrastructure (e.g., tractable input events modulating exposure) from idealized bio-CAS (e.g., the immune system). The proposed model structure extends the classic simple SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected, resistant/recovered) uni-causal compartmental model, widely used in epidemiology, into an 8th-order functional network SEI3R2S-Nrec model structure, with infection partitioned into three severity states (e.g., starts in I1 [mostly asymptomatic], then I2 if notable symptoms, then I3 if ideally hospitalized) that connect via a lattice of fluxes to two ""resistant"" (R) states. Here Nrec (""not recovered"") represents a placeholder for better tying emerging COVID-19 medical research findings with those from epidemiology.

MethodsBorrowing from fuzzy logic, a given model represents a ""Universe of Discourse"" (UoD) that is based on assumptions. Nonlinear flux rates are implemented using the classic Hill function, widely used in the biochemical and pharmaceutical fields and intuitive for inclusion within differential equations. There is support for ""encounter"" input events that modulate ongoing E (exposures) fluxes via S{leftrightarrow}I1 and other I1/2/3 encounters, partitioned into a ""social/group"" (uSG(t)) behavioral subgroup (e.g., ideally informed by evolving science best-practices), and a smaller uTB(t) subgroup with added ""spreader"" lifestyle and event support. In addition to signal and flux trajectories (e.g., plotted over 300 days), key cumulative output metrics include fluxes such as I3[-&gt;]D deaths, I2[-&gt;]I3 hospital admittances, I1[-&gt;]I2 related to ""cases"" and R1+R2 resistant. The code, currently available as a well-commented Matlab Live Script file, uses a common modeling framework developed for a portfolio of other physiological models that tie to a planned textbook; an interactive web-based version will follow.

ResultsDefault population results are provided for the USA as a whole, three states in which this author has lived (Arizona, Wisconsin, Oregon), and several special hypothetical cases of idealized UoDs (e.g., nursing home; healthy lower-risk mostly on I1[-&gt;]R1 path to evaluate reinfection possibilities). Often known events were included (e.g., pulses for holiday weekends; Trump/governor-inspired summer outbreak in Arizona). Runs were mildly tuned by the author, in two stages: i) mild model-tuning (e.g., for risk demographics such as obesity), then ii) iterative input tuning to obtain similar overall March-thru-November curve shapes and appropriate cumulative numbers (recognizing limitations of data like ""cases""). Predictions are consistent deaths, and CDC estimates of actual cases and immunity (e.g., antibodies). Results could be further refined by groups with more resources (human, data access, computational). It is hoped that its structure and causal predictions might prove helpful to policymakers, medical professionals, and ""on the ground"" managers of science-based interventions.

Discussion and Future DirectionsThese include: i) sensitivity of the model to parameters; ii) possible next steps for this SEI3R2S-Nrec framework such as dynamic sub-models to better address compartment-specific forms of population diversity (e.g., for E [host-parasite biophysics], Is [infection diversity], and/or Rs [immune diversity]); iii) models potential utility as a framework for applying optimal/feedback control engineering to help manage the ongoing pandemic response in the context of competing subcriteria and emerging new tools (e.g., more timely testing, vaccines); and iv) ways in which the Nrec medical submodel could be expanded to provide refined estimates of the types of tissue damage, impairments and dysfunction that are known byproducts of the COVID-19 disease process, including as a function of existing comorbidities.","Winters, J.

16376,Using Automated-Machine Learning to Predict COVID-19 Patient Survival: Identify Influential Biomarkers,"BackgroundIn a pandemic, it is important for clinicians to stratify patients and decide who receives limited medical resources. In this study, we used automated machine learning (autoML) to develop and compare between multiple machine learning (ML) models that predict the chance of patient survival from COVID-19 infection and identified the best-performing model. In addition, we investigated which biomarkers are the most influential in generating an accurate model. We believe an ML model such as this could be a useful tool for clinicians stratifying hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients.

MethodsThe data was retrospectively collected from Clinical Looking Glass (CLG) on all patients testing positive for COVID-19 through a nasopharyngeal specimen by real-time RT-PCR and admitted between 3/1/2020-7/3/2020 (4376 patients) at our institution. We collected 47 biomarkers from each patient within 36 hours before or after the index time: RT-PCR positivity, and tracked whether a patient survived or not for one month following this time. We utilized the autoML from H2O.ai, an open source package for R language. The autoML generated 20 ML models and ranked them by area under the precision-recall curve (AUCPR) on the test set. We selected the best model (model_var_47) and chose a threshold probability that maximized F2 score to make a binary classifier: dead or alive. Subsequently, we ranked the relative importance of variables that generated model_var_47 and chose the 10 most influential variables. Next, we reran the autoML with these 10 variables and likewise selected the model with the best AUCPR on the test set (model_var_10). Again, threshold probability that maximized F2 score for model_var_10 was chosen to make a binary classifier. We calculated and compared the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predicate value (PPV) for model_var_10 and model_var_47.

ResultsThe best model that autoML generated using all 47 variables was the stacked ensemble model of all models (AUCPR = 0.836). The most influential variables were: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, blood urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, d-dimer, troponin, and glucose. When the autoML was retrained with these 10 most important variables, it did not significantly affect the performance (AUCPR= 0.828). For the binary classifiers, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV of model_var_47 was 83.6%, 87.7%, and 69.8% respectively, while for model_var_10 they were 90.9%, 71.1%, and 51.8% respectively.

ConclusionsBy using autoML, we developed high-performing models that predict patient mortality from COVID-19 infection. In addition, we identified the most important biomarkers correlated with mortality. This ML model can be used as a decision supporting tool for medical practitioners to efficiently triage COVID-19 infected patients. From our literature review, this will be the largest COVID-19 patient cohort to train ML models and the first to utilize autoML.

As it is thought to confer some degree of immunity, this study is carried out to know the relationship between demographics and ct value of confirmed rt-PCR patients. A total of 384 serum samples were collected between 4-6 weeks after confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. IgG positivity was found to be 80.2% (95% CI, 76.2 - 84.2). The IgG positivity increased with the decrease in the ct value, with highest of 87.6% positivity in individuals with <20 ct value. The mean ({+/-} SD) ct value of IgG positives and og IgG negatives was 23.34 ({+/-} 6.09) and 26.72 ({+/-} 7.031) respectively. There was no significant difference found between the demographic characteristics such as age, sex, symptoms and antibody response. The current study is first of its kind wherein we have assessed the correlation of ct of RT-PCR with development of IgG against SARS-CoV-2.

5753,Ecologic correlation between underlying population level morbidities and COVID-19 case fatality rate among countries infected with SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundThe ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is unprecedented in scope. High income countries (HIC) seemingly account for the majority of the mortalities considering that these countries have screened more persons. Low middle income countries (LMIC) countries may experience far worse mortalities considering the existence of a weaker health care system and the several underlying population level morbidities. As a result, it becomes imperative to understand the ecological correlation between critical underlying population level morbidities and COVID-19 case fatality rates (CFR).

MethodThis is an ecological study using data on COVID-19 cases, prevalence of COPD, prevalence of tobacco use, adult HIV prevalence, quality of air and life expectancy. We plotted a histogram, performed the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and used spearman correlation to assess the degree of correlation between COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) and other covariates mentioned above.

ResultAs at the 31st of March 2020, there were a total of 846,281 cases of COVID-19 from 204 countries and a global case fatality rate of 5% (range 0% to 29%). Angola and Sudan both had the highest CFR of 29%, while Italy had the highest number of deaths (i.e. 12,428) as at 31st of March 2020. Adult HIV prevalence has a significant but weak negative correlation with CFR (correlation coefficient = - 0.24, p value =0.01) while all the other variables have positive correlation with CFR due to COVID-19 though not statistically significant. Of the 204 countries analyzed, only 11 countries (i.e. 5%) had complete datasets across all 5 population level morbidities (i.e. prevalence of COPD, prevalence of tobacco use, life expectancy, quality of air, and adult HIV prevalence variables). Correlations of CFR from these 11 countries were similar to that from the 204 countries except for the correlation with quality of air and prevalence of tobacco use. Conclusion: While we interpret our data with caution given the fact that this is an ecological study, our findings suggest that population level factors such as prevalence of COPD, prevalence of tobacco use, life expectancy and quality of air are positively correlated with CFR from COVID-19 but, adult HIV prevalence has a weak and negative correlation with COVID-19 CFR and would require extensive research.","Okpokoro, E.; Igbinomwanhia, V.; Jedy-Agba, E.; Kayode, G.; Onyemata, E.; Abimiku, A.",2020-05-02,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.28.20082370,1,Evaezi Okpokoro,Institute of Human Virology Nigeria,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20082370v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20082370v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
19547,Cardiac SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with distinct transcriptomic changes within the heart,"1BackgroundAnalyses in hospitalized patients and small autopsy series suggest that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect the heart. We investigated heart tissue by in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and RNA sequencing in consecutive autopsy cases to quantify virus load and characterize cardiac involvement in COVID-19.

MethodsLeft ventricular tissue from 95 deceased with diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection undergoing autopsy was analyzed and clinical data were collected. RNA was isolated to examine virus load of SARS- CoV-2 and its replication in the heart. A virus load >1000 copies per {micro}g RNA was defined as relevant. Viral RNA and inflammatory cells were assessed using histology. RNA sequencing and gene ontology (GO) enrichment were performed in 10 cases with high cardiac virus load and 10 age-matched cases without cardiac infection.

ResultsA relevant SARS-CoV-2 virus load was detected in 41 out of 95 deceased (43%). The median cardiac virus load was 7952 copies per {micro}g RNA (IQR 2507, 32 005). In situ hybridization revealed SARS- CoV-2 RNA primarily in the interstitium or interstitial cells. Virus detection was not associated with increased inflammatory cells. Relevant cardiac infection was associated with increased expression of the entry factor TMPRSS2. Cardiac virus replication was found in 14/95 hearts (15%). Remarkably, cardiac virus replication was associated with shorter time between diagnosis and death. RNA sequencing revealed clear activation of immune response pathways to virus infection and destruction of cardiomyocytes. Hearts with high virus load showed activation of the GO term ""extracellular exosomes"".

ConclusionSARS-CoV-2 infection including virus replication and distinct transcriptomic alterations without signs of myocarditis demonstrate a cardiac involvement. In this autopsy series, cardiac replication of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with early death.","Lindner, D.; Braeuninger, H.; Stoffers, B.; Fitzek, A.; Meissner, K.; Aleshcheva, G.; Schweizer, M.; Weimann, J.; Rotter, B.; Warnke, S.; Edler, C.; Braun, F.; Roedl, K.; Scherschel, K.; Escher, F.; Kluge, S.; Huber, T.

9883,Detection of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in both serum and saliva enhances detection of infection,"BackgroundDetecting antibody responses during and after SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential in determining the seroepidemiology of the virus and the potential role of antibody in disease. Scalable, sensitive and specific serological assays are essential to this process. The detection of antibody in hospitalized patients with severe disease has proven straightforward; detecting responses in subjects with mild disease and asymptomatic infections has proven less reliable. We hypothesized that the suboptimal sensitivity of antibody assays and the compartmentalization of the antibody response may contribute to this effect.

MethodsWe systemically developed an ELISA assay, optimising different antigens and amplification steps, in serum and saliva from symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects.

ResultsUsing trimeric spike glycoprotein, rather than nucleocapsid enabled detection of responses in individuals with low antibody responses. IgG1 and IgG3 predominate to both antigens, but more anti-spike IgG1 than IgG3 was detectable. All antigens were effective for detecting responses in hospitalized patients. Anti-spike, but not nucleocapsid, IgG, IgA and IgM antibody responses were readily detectable in saliva from non-hospitalized symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Antibody responses in saliva and serum were largely independent of each other and symptom reporting.

ConclusionsDetecting antibody responses in both saliva and serum is optimal for determining virus exposure and understanding immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

12190,"Threshold analyses on rates of testing, transmission, and contact for COVID-19 control in a university setting","We simulated epidemic projections of a potential COVID-19 outbreak in a university population of 38,000 persons, under varying combinations of mass test rate (0% to 10%), contact trace and test rate (0% to 50%), transmission rate (probability of transmission per contact per day), and contact rate (number of contacts per person per day). We simulated four levels of transmission rate, 14% (average baseline), 8% (average for face mask use), 5.4% (average for 3ft distancing), and 2.5% (average for 6ft distancing and face mask use), interpolating results to the full range to understand the impact of uncertainty in effectiveness, feasibility, and adherence of face mask use and physical distancing. We evaluated contact rates between 1 and 25, to identify the threshold that, if exceeded, could lead to several deaths.

When transmission rate was 8%, for trace and test at 50%, the contact rate threshold was 8. However, any time delays in trace, test, and isolation quickly raised the number of deaths. Keeping contact rate to 3 or below was more robust to testing delays, keeping deaths below 1 up to a delay of 5 days from the time of infection to diagnosis and isolation. For a contact rate of 3, the number of trace and tests peaked to about 70 per day and relaxed to 25 with the addition of 10% mass test. When transmission rate was 5.4%, for trace and test at 50%, the contact rate threshold was 10. However, keeping contact rate to 4 or below was more robust to delays in testing, keeping deaths below 1 up to a delay of 6 days from the time of infection to diagnosis and isolation. For contact rate of 4, the number of trace and tests peaked at 50 per day and relaxed to 10 per day with the addition of 10% mass test.

Threshold estimates can help develop on-campus scheduling and indoor-spacing plans in conjunction with plans for asymptomatic testing for COVID-19. Combination thresholds should be selected specific to the setting based on an assessment of the feasibility and resource availability for testing and quarantine.","Zhao, X.; Tatapudi, H.

16074,Comparison of efficacy of Dexamethasone and Methylprednisolone in improving P/F ratio among COVID-19 patients,"IntroductionThe severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), created a pandemic in late 2019. Acute respiratory distress syndrome can occur in patients with COVID-19 due to viral replication and an uncontrolled immune reaction. Therefore, antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments are of particular interest to clinicians. We compared the efficacy of methylprednisolone and dexamethasone in reducing inflammation and improving the partial pressure of arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2 or P/F) ratio in COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe selected 60 files for this retrospective quasi-experimental study using a convenient sampling technique and divided them into two groups of 30 patients each who had received either dexamethasone or methylprednisolone. The data were taken from the medical records of the treated patients. Group 1 patients were given dexamethasone 8 mg twice daily, and Group 2 patients were given methylprednisolone 40 mg twice daily for eight days during their stay in our high dependency unit and our Intensive Care Unit. The remaining treatment was the same for both groups using antibiotics and anticoagulation. We reviewed C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin level, and P/F ratio before and after the administration of both drugs for eight days. We used a paired t-test to assess the effectiveness of both drugs on the P/F ratio of participants.

ResultsThe initial mean CRP level of Group 1 was 110.34 mg/L, which decreased to 19.45 mg/L after administration of dexamethasone; similarly, the CRP of Group 2 was 108.65 mg/L, which decreased to 43.82 mg/L after administering methylprednisolone for eight days. Both dexamethasone and methylprednisolone significantly improved the P/F ratio (p<0.05), and dexamethasone was significantly more effective than methylprednisolone (p<0.05).

ConclusionSteroids ability to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune response make them an effective tool in the treatment of COVID-19. Steroid therapy is effective in controlling inflammation markers, and, specifically, dexamethasone is effective in improving the P/F ratio in COVID-19 patients. Physicians should consider the use of dexamethasone use in appropriate patients with COVID-19.","Rana, M. A.; Hashmi, M. S.; Qayyum, A.; Pervaiz, R.; Saleem, M.; Munir, M. F.; Ullah Saif, M.

13322,Mass screening of asymptomatic persons for SARS-CoV-2 using saliva,"BackgroundCOVID-19 has rapidly evolved to become a global pandemic due largely to the transmission of its causative virus through asymptomatic carriers. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic people is an urgent priority for the prevention and containment of disease outbreaks in communities. However, few data are available in asymptomatic persons regarding the accuracy of PCR testing. Additionally, although self-collected saliva has significant logistical advantages in mass screening, its utility as an alternative specimen in asymptomatic persons is yet to be determined.

MethodsWe conducted a mass-screening study to compare the utility of nucleic acid amplification, such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, using NPS and saliva samples from each individual in two cohorts of asymptomatic persons: the contact tracing cohort and the airport quarantine cohort.

ResultsIn this mass-screening study including 1,924 individuals, the sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification testing with nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens were 86% (90%CI:77-93%) and 92% (90%CI:83-97%), respectively, with specificities greater than 99.9%. The true concordance probability between the nasopharyngeal and saliva tests was estimated at 0.998 (90%CI:0.996-0.999) on the estimated airport prevalence, 0.3%. In positive individuals, viral load was highly correlated between NPS and saliva.

ConclusionBoth nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens had high sensitivity and specificity. Self-collected saliva is a valuable specimen to detect SARS-CoV-2 in mass screening of asymptomatic persons.","Yokota, I.; Shane, P.

1756,"Data-Based Analysis, Modelling and Forecasting of the COVID-19 outbreak","Since the first suspected case of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, a total of 40,235 confirmed cases and 909 deaths have been reported in China up to February 10, 2020, evoking fear locally and internationally. Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei, China from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters. In particular, we provide an estimation of the case fatality and case recovery ratios, along with their 90% confidence intervals as the outbreak evolves. On the basis of a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIDR) model, we provide estimations of the basic reproduction number (R0), and the per day infection mortality and recovery rates. By calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to the reported data, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the of the outbreak at the epicenter three weeks ahead, i.e. until February 29. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, which can be considered only as a subset of the actual numbers of infected and recovered cases in the total population, we have repeated the calculations under a second scenario that considers twenty times the number of confirmed infected cases and forty times the number of recovered, leaving the number of deaths unchanged. Based on the reported data, the expected value of R0 as computed considering the period from the 11th of January until the 18th of January, using the official counts of confirmed cases was found to be [~]4.6, while the one computed under the second scenario was found to be [~]3.2. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R0 was found to be [~] 2.6 based on confirmed cases and2 based on the second scenario. Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the simulations suggest that the cumulative number of infected could reach 180,000 (with lower bound of 45,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of the up to the 10th of February reported data, the death toll might exceed 2,700 (as a lower bound) by February 29. Our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the case fatality ratio from January 26 to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but mainly because of the fact that the actual cumulative numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population most likely are much higher than the reported ones. Thus, in a scenario where we have taken twenty times the confirmed number of infected and forty times the confirmed number of recovered cases, the case fatality ratio is around [~] 0.15% in the total population. Importantly, based on this scenario, simulations suggest a slow down of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February.","Anastassopoulou, C.; Russo, L.; Tsakris, A.; Siettos, C.",2020-03-12,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.02.11.20022186,5,Constantinos Siettos,University of Naples Federico II,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022186v5?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022186v5.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1371/journal.pone.0230405
20789,Genomic insights into early SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated in Reunion Island,"The relative isolation of many island communities provides some protection from the COVID-19 pandemic, as imported cases can be limited and traced effectively. Until recently, this was true for the population of the French overseas department, Reunion Island, where only limited numbers of autochthonous cases were observed prior to August 2020. Since the report of the first case of COVID-19, contact tracing has been carried out for each new case identified in Reunion Island to identify transmission and clusters. To contribute to the public health response and understand the diffusion of SARS-Cov-2 strains in Reunion Island, we established in-house genome sequencing capability in Reunion using Oxford nanopore technology (MinION) as an inexpensive option for genomic typing of SARS-CoV-2 lineages on the island, and cross-validated typing results between viral isolation methods and different sequencing technologies. The results of our work during the early phase of the epidemics are presented herein.

17489,"Per capita COVID-19 Case Rates are Lower in U.S. Counties Voting more Heavily Democratic in the 2016 Presidential Election, except not in States with a Republican Governor and Legislature","In our recent paper Why do per capita COVID-19 Case Rates Differ Between U.S. States? we established that U.S. states with a Democratic governor and a Democratic legislature have lower COVID-19 per capita case rates than states with a Republican governor and a Republican legislature, and case rates of states with a mixed government fall between the two. This difference remained after accounting for differences between states in several demographic and socio-economic variables. In a recent working paper The Changing Political Geographies of COVID-19 in the U.S. it was found that that early in the pandemic U.S. counties at higher levels of percentage Democratic vote in the 2016 presidential election had higher weekly per capita COVID-19 rates, but that the situation was in the opposite direction by August 2020. We show here that counties with a higher percentage of Democratic vote in the 2016 presidential election have a lower mean cumulative per capita rate of COVID-19 cases and of COVID-19 deaths, adjusted for county demographic and socio-economic characteristics, but only for counties in states that currently have a Democratic governor and both chambers of the legislature Democratic or in states that have a mixed government, but not for states that currently have a Republican governor and both chambers in the legislature Republican. One possible contributor to this difference is that some state Republican governments have restricted local action to fight the spread of COVID-19.","Chambless, L.",2020-11-08,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.11.03.20225425,2,Lloyd Chambless,Retired,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.03.20225425v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.03.20225425v2.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
6412,Testing lags and emerging COVID-19 outbreaks in federal penitentiaries in Canada,"ObjectivesTo provide the first known comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 outcomes in a federal penitentiary system. We examined the following COVID-19 outcomes within federal penitentiaries in Canada and contrasted them with estimates for the overall population in the penitentiaries respective provincial jurisdictions: testing, prevalence, the proportion recovered, and fatality.

MethodsData for prisons were obtained from the Correctional Service of Canada and, for the general population, from the Esri COVID-19 Canadian Outbreak Tracking Hub. Data were retrieved between March 30 and April 21, 2020, and are accurate to this date. Penitentiary-, province- and sex-specific frequency statistics for each outcome were calculated.

ResultsData on 50 of 51 penitentiaries (98%) were available. Of these, 72% of penitentiaries reported fewer tests per 1000 population than the Canadian general population average (16 tests/1000 population), and 24% of penitentiaries reported zero tests. Penitentiaries with high levels of testing were those that already had elevated COVID-19 prevalence. Five penitentiaries reported an outbreak (at least one case). Hardest hit penitentiaries were those in Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia, with some prisons reporting COVID-19 prevalence of 30% to 40%. Of these, two were womens prisons. Female prisoners were over-represented among cases (31% of cases overall, despite representing 5% of the total prison population).

ConclusionIncreased sentinel or universal testing may be appropriate given the confined nature of prison populations. This, along with rigorous infection prevention control practices and the potential release of prisoners, will be needed to curb current outbreaks and those likely to come.

13932,The importance of supplementary immunisation activities to prevent measles outbreaks during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted routine measles immunisation and supplementary immunisation activities (SIAs) in most countries including Kenya. We assessed the risk of measles outbreaks during the pandemic in Kenya as a case study for the African Region.

MethodsCombining measles serological data, local contact patterns, and vaccination coverage into a cohort model, we predicted the age-adjusted population immunity in Kenya and estimated the probability of outbreaks when contact-reducing COVID-19 interventions are lifted. We considered various scenarios for reduced measles vaccination coverage from April 2020.

FindingsIn February 2020, when a scheduled SIA was postponed, population immunity was close to the herd immunity threshold and the probability of a large outbreak was 22% (0-46). As the COVID-19 restrictions to physical contact are lifted, from December 2020, the probability of a large measles outbreak increased to 31% (8-51), 35% (16-52) and 43% (31-56) assuming a 15%, 50% and 100% reduction in measles vaccination coverage. By December 2021, this risk increases further to 37% (17-54), 44% (29-57) and 57% (48-65) for the same coverage scenarios respectively. However, the increased risk of a measles outbreak following the lifting of restrictions on contact can be overcome by conducting an SIA with [&ge;] 95% coverage in under-fives.

InterpretationWhile contact restrictions sufficient for SAR-CoV-2 control temporarily reduce measles transmissibility and the risk of an outbreak from a measles immunity gap, this risk rises rapidly once physical distancing is relaxed. Implementing delayed SIAs will be critical for prevention of measles outbreaks once contact restrictions are fully lifted in Kenya.

3853,"The basic reproduction number and prediction of the epidemic size of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Shahroud, Iran","ObjectivesTo estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 in the early stage of the epidemic and predict the expected number of new cases in Shahroud, Northeast of Iran.

MethodsThe R0 of COVID-19 was estimated using the serial interval distribution and the number of incidence cases. The serial interval was fit with a gamma distribution. The probable incidence and cumulative incidence in the next 30 days were predicted using the assumption that daily incidence follows a Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. Data analysis was done using ""earlyR"" and ""projections"" packages in R software.

ResultsThe maximum-likelihood value of R0 was 2.7 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1 to 3.4) for the COVID-19 epidemic in the early 14 days and decreased to 1.13 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.25) by the end of the day 41.

18917,At-home self-testing of teachers with a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test to reduce potential transmissions in schools,"BackgroundRapid antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 became available recently, offering an opportunity to vastly increase testing capacities. Antigen tests offer lower sensitivity than the gold standard, RT-PCR, but rapid sample-to-answer time. High-frequency testing with an antigen test may offset the lower sensitivity, and testing can be done with at-home collection of samples, offering potential benefit in screening efforts. In this study, we set out to evaluate the practical application of self-performed high-frequency antigen test in a school setting.

MethodA total of 711 teachers from 86 schools were enrolled in a seven-week study. After instruction, participants tested themselves every 48 hours at home with a rapid antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 (target: nucleocapsid protein) in a self-collected anterior nasal swab. Positive results in the antigen test were confirmed via RT-PCR from the same sample that had been determined to be positive by the study participant. A questionnaire was given to all participants to evaluate whether the test failed to detect infection.

Findings10 836 tests from 602 teachers were recorded and analyzed. A total of five confirmed cases of viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 was detected by use of the antigen test. One study participant with a SARS-CoV-2 infection was presymptomatic and four were mildly symptomatic at the time of the antigen test. Sixteen false positive antigen tests (0.15% of all tests) were reported, predominantly when the local incidence in the general population was low. In four cases, the study participant reported that a PCR had detected a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the antigen test was negative, indicating a false negative result.

InterpretationHigh-frequency, self-performed rapid antigen tests can detect individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection, and therefore potentially reduce transmissions. Testing may be most beneficial when applied during high local incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections and when mild or atypical symptoms are present. To avoid a high rate of false positive results, a test with optimized specificity should be used.

FundingThe study was commissioned and funded by the Hessian Ministry of Education and the Hessian Ministry of Integration and Social Affairs.","Hoehl, S.; Schenk, B.; Rudych, O.; Goettig, S.; Foppa, I.; Kohmer, N.; Karaca, O.; Toptan, T.; Ciesek, S.",2020-12-07,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.12.04.20243410,1,Sandra Ciesek,"University Hospital, Goethe University Frankfurt",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.04.20243410v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.04.20243410v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
10774,"Positivity of SARS-CoV-2, by RT-PCR among workers of a Public Hospital in the city of Santos, SP, Brazil 2020.","BackgroundInfection with SARS-CoV-2, associated with severe respiratory symptoms, currently called COVID-19, represents one of the greatest health challenges of this century. Health professionals, as well as hospital workers, are the most vulnerable population for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 due to their greater proximity to sick patients, especially in specialized hospitals for the treatment of these patients.

Study DesignWe ran a questionnaire by all the employees of a Public Service Hospital specialised in COVID-19 treatment (1307 employees), in the municipality of Santos, Sao Paulo, Brazil, who presented some symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and positive results by RT-PCR, in Oropharynx Swab collection. The questionnaire collected socio-demographic information, as well as data related to the work areas where they were divided into two groups: Employees at higher risk or those who directly deal with patients (914 employees or 69.9%) and lower risk for employees in the administrative area (393 employees or 30.1%).

Results211 (16.1%) of the Hospitals employees had to stop their work-related activities due to presenting positive RT-PCR. There were 39 (9.9%) positives in low risk areas and 172 (18.8%) positives in employees in high risk areas. Within the latter group, Nurses, Nursing Assistants and Doctors were the most frequently infected professionals. Regarding the symptoms of professionals positively diagnosed based on RT-PCR, the most frequent symptoms were body pain (83.4%); headache (80.6%); fever (57.8%) and dry cough (53.1%).

ConclusionA high proportion of workers in COVID-19 specialized hospitals was infected by the virus, despite all the protective measures adopted, showing the high transmission capacity of this virus. Stricter individual protection measures among employees must be adopted.","Caseiro, M. M.; Mazzurana, M.; Barreiro, B.; Barbosa, E. C.; Barbosa, A.

4235,COVID-19 most vulnerable Mexican cities lack the public health infrastructure to face the pandemic: a new temporally-explicit model,"Recently, a wide array of epidemiological models have been developed to guide public health actors in containing the rapid dissemination of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), cause of COVID-19. Despite their usefulness, many epidemiological models recently developed to understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and infection rates of COVID-19 fall short as they ignore human mobility, limiting our understanding of the spread of the disease, together with the vulnerability of population centers in a broad scale. We developed a new temporally-explicit model and simulated several social distancing scenarios to predict the vulnerability to COVID-19 of 50 Mexican cities that are interconnected by their air transportation network. Additionally, we assessed the sufficiency of the public health infrastructure in the focal cities to face the pandemic over time. Based on our model, we show that the most important cities within the Mexican air transportation network are the most vulnerable to COVID-19, with all assessed public health infrastructure being insufficient to face the modeled scenario for the pandemic after 100 days. Despite these alarming findings, our results show that social distancing could dramatically decrease the total number of infected people (77% drop-off for the 45% distancing scenario when contrasted with no distancing), flattening the growth of infection rate. Thus, we consider that this study provides useful information that may help decision-makers to timely implement health policies to anticipate and lessen the impact of the current pandemic in Mexico.

Significance StatementWe used a new temporally-explicit model focused on air transportation networks to predict the vulnerability of 50 focal Mexican cities to COVID-19. We found that most vulnerable cities lack of the required public health infrastructure (i.e., number of inpatient and intensive care unit beds) to face this new pandemic, overloading in all cases after 100 days. However, our results show that a 45% social distancing scenario can reduce the number of infected people by up to 78.7%, flattening the growth rate of people with COVID-19 before infection rates soar exponentially countrywide.","Dattilo, W.; Silva, A.

4801,"COVID-19 diagnosis and study of serum SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA, IgM and IgG by chemiluminescence immunoanalysis","BackgroundThe pandemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing great loss. Detecting viral RNAs is standard approach for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis with variable success. Currently, studies describing the serological diagnostic methods are emerging, while most of them just involve the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG by ELISA or ""flow immunoassay"" with limited accuracy.

MethodsDiagnostic approach depends on chemiluminescence immunoanalysis (CLIA) for detecting IgA, IgM and IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) was developed. The approach was tested with 216 sera from 87 COVID-19 patients and 483 sera from SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals. The diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Concentration kinetics of RBD-specific serum antibodies were characterized. The relationship of serum RBD-specific antibodies and disease severity was analyzed.

ResultsThe diagnostic accuracy based on RBD outperformed those based on NP. Adding IgA to a conventional serological test containing IgM and IgG improves sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis at early stage. CLIA for detecting RBD-specific IgA, IgM and IgG showed diagnostic sensitivities of 98.6%, 96.8% and 96.8%, and specificities of 98.1%, 92.3% and 99.8%, respectively. Median concentration of IgA and IgM peaked during 16-20 days after illness onset at 8.84 g/mL and 7.25 g/mL, respectively, while IgG peaked during 21-25 days after illness onset at 16.47 g/mL. Furthermore, the serum IgA level positively correlates with COVID-19 severity.

ConclusionCLIA for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgA, IgM and IgG in blood provides additional values for diagnosing and monitoring of COVID-19.

SummaryChemiluminescence immunoanalysis of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific serum IgA as well as IgM and IgG improves accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis. Concentration kinetics of serum RBD-specific IgA, IgM and IgG are revealed.

ObjectThis study was conducted to evaluate a rule of thumb for prediction from past wave experiences.

MethodWe rescaled the number of newly infected patients as 100% at the peak and checked similarities among waves. Then we extrapolated the courses of the third and later waves.

ResultsResults show some similarity around the second and the third waves. Based on this similarity, we expected the bottom of the third wave will show 2131 newly positive patients including asymptomatic patients at around the end of February, 2021.

Discussion and ConclusionWe can infer the course of the third wave from similarity with the second wave. Mathematical modelling has been unable to do it, even when AI was used for prediction.

19482,"SARS-CoV-2 infection, risk perception, behaviour, and preventive measures at schools in Berlin, Germany, during the early post-lockdown phase: A cross-sectional study","BackgroundBriefly before the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Berlin, Germany, schools closed in mid-March 2020 for six weeks. Following re-opening, schools gradually resumed operation at a reduced level for nine weeks preceding the summer holidays.

AimDuring this phase, we conducted a situational assessment in schools among students and teachers as to infection status, symptoms, affective, behavioural, educational issues, and preventive measures.

MethodsAt twenty-four randomly selected primary and secondary schools, one class each was examined. Oro-nasopharyngeal swabs and capillary blood samples were collected to assess SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR) and specific IgG (ELISA), respectively. Medical history, household and schooling characteristics, leisure time activities, fear of infection, risk perception, hand hygiene, physical distancing, and facemask wearing were assessed.

ResultsAmong 535 participants (385 students, 150 staff), one teenager was SARS-CoV-2 infected (0.2%), and seven individuals exhibited specific IgG (1.3%); 16% reported symptoms upon examination, and 48% in the preceding 14 days. Compared to before the pandemic, the proportion of leisure time spent as screen-time increased, and the majority of primary school students reported reduced physical activity. Fear of infection and risk perception were relatively low, but acceptance of adapted health behaviours was high. Governmental preventive measures were adequately implemented, with primary schools performing better than secondary schools.

ConclusionIn this phase of rare infection and low seroreactivity, individual and school-level infection prevention and control measures were largely adhered to. Nevertheless, vigilance, continued and proactive preventive measures, and well-rehearsed reaction options are essential to cope with increasing pandemic activity.","Hommes, F.; Van Loon, W.; Thielecke, M.; Abramovich, I.; Lieber, S.; Hammerich, R.; Gehrke-Beck, S.; Linzbach, E.; Schuster, A.; Von Dem Busche, K.; Theuring, S.; Gertler, M.; Equihua Martinez, G.; Richter, J.; Bergmann, C.; Bölke, A.; Böhringer, F.; Mall, M.

15043,Novel ELISA protocol links pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibodies with endemic coronavirus immunity and age and reveals improved serologic identification of acute COVID-19 via multi-parameter detection,"The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically impacted work, economy, and way of life worldwide in 2020. Sensitive measurement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies would provide new insight into pre-existing immunity, virus transmission dynamics, and the nuances of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. To date, existing SARS-CoV-2 serology tests have limited utility due to insufficient reliable detection of antibody levels lower than what is typically present after several days of symptoms. To measure lower quantities of SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA with higher resolution than existing assays, we developed a new ELISA protocol with a distinct plate washing procedure and timed plate development via use of a standard curve. This  BU ELISA method exhibits very low signal from samples added to buffer coated wells at as low as a 1:5 dilution. Use of this method revealed circulating SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (N) reactive antibodies (IgG, IgM, and/or IgA) in 44 and 100 percent of pre-pandemic subjects, respectively, and the magnitude of these antibodies tracked with antibody levels of analogous viral proteins from the 229E and/or NL63 endemic coronavirus (eCoV) strains. The disease status (HIV, SLE) of unexposed subjects was not linked with SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibody levels; however, quantities were significantly lower in subjects over 70 years of age compared with younger counterparts. Also, we measured SARS-CoV-2 RBD- and N-specific IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies from 29 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals at varying disease states, including 10 acute COVID-19 hospitalized subjects with negative serology results by the EUA approved Abbott IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Measurements of SARS-CoV-2 RBD- and N-specific IgM, IgG, IgA levels measured by the BU ELISA revealed higher signal from 9 of the 10 Abbott test negative COVID-19 subjects than all pre-pandemic samples for at least one antibody specificity/isotype, implicating improved serologic identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection via multi-parameter, high sensitive antibody detection. We propose that this improved ELISA protocol, which is straightforward to perform, low cost, and uses readily available commercial reagents, is a useful tool to elucidate new information about SARS-CoV-2 infection and immunity and has promising implications for improved detection of all analytes measurable by this platform.","Yuen, R.; Steiner, D.; Pihl, R.; Chavez, E.; Olson, A.; Baird, L.; Korkmaz, F.; Urick, P.; Sagar, M.; Berrigan, J.; Gummuluru, R.; Corley, R.; Quillen, K.; Belkina, A.; Mostoslavsky, G.; Rifkin, I.; Kataria, Y.; Cappione, A.; Lin, N.; Bhadelia, N.; Snyder-Cappione, J.; Smith, E.

1805,A model simulation study on effects of intervention measures in Wuhan COVID-19 epidemic,"BackgroundIn the beginning of January 2020, new unknown virus pneumonia cases started to emerge in local hospitals in Wuhan, China. This virus epidemic quickly became a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO. Enormous amount of medical supplies as well as healthcare personals from other provinces were mobilized to support Wuhan. This current work tent to help people understanding how infectious disease spread and the purpose and consequences of various efforts based on simulation model.

Methoda simulation model was created using known parameters. R0 set to 3 and mean incubation time to be 7.5days. the epidemic was divided to 3 periods. Simulation would run 50 times to mimic different patient0 status. Personal activity index was used to mimic different level of control measures. 141427709 simulated patients were created. Cumulation number of patients at the end of period 1 (day50) is 2868.7{+/-}1739.0. Total infected patients could be 913396.5 {+/-} 559099.9 by the end of period 2 (day70) in free transmission state.

20085,"SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the urban population of Qatar: An analysis of antibody testing on a sample of 112,941 individuals","BackgroundQatar has experienced a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our first objective was to assess the proportion of the urban population that has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, by measuring the prevalence of detectable antibodies. Our second objective was to identify predictors for infection and for having higher antibody titers.

MethodsResidual blood specimens from individuals receiving routine and other clinical care between May 12-September 9, 2020 were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Associations with seropositivity and higher antibody titers were identified through regression analyses. Probability weights were applied in deriving the epidemiological measures.

ResultsWe tested 112,941 individuals ([~]10% of Qatars urban population), of whom 51.6% were men and 66.0% were 20-49 years of age. Seropositivity was 13.3% (95% CI: 13.1-13.6%) and was significantly associated with sex, age, nationality, clinical-care type, and testing date. The proportion with higher antibody titers varied by age, nationality, clinical-care type, and testing date. There was a strong correlation between higher antibody titers and seroprevalence in each nationality, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.47-0.96), suggesting that higher antibody titers may indicate repeated exposure to the virus. The percentage of antibody-positive persons with prior PCR-confirmed diagnosis was 47.1% (95% CI: 46.1-48.2%), severity rate was 3.9% (95% CI: 3.7-4.2%), criticality rate was 1.3% (95% CI: 1.1-1.4%), and fatality rate was 0.3% (95% CI: 0.2-0.3%).

ConclusionsFewer than two in every 10 individuals in Qatars urban population had detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 between May 12-September 9, 2020, suggesting that this population is still far from the herd immunity threshold and at risk from a subsequent epidemic wave.","Coyle, P.

17448,"Test-adjusted results of mortality for Covid-19 in Germany, USA, UK","In a disease, where all infected persons show symptoms, it is reasonable to calculate mortality by case to fatality rate CFR. Deaths follow infections by a certain time lag. However, in the Covid-19 pandemic many infectious patients show no or hardly any symptoms. The reported infections and deaths do not run parallel, but diverge with the volume of tests.

Our investigations for Germany, USA and UK indicate that deaths do not follow the number of infections, but the positive rate of tests, multiplied by a constant factor F and shifted by about two weeks. These test adjusted results of mortality allow for the estimation of the number of deaths of Covid-19 about two weeks ahead, even in a sharply rising state of the pandemic.

14548,Characteristics of COVID-19 recurrence: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundPrevious studies reported the recurrence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among discharge patients. This study aimed to examine the characteristic of repositive COVID-19 cases by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis.

MethodsA systematic search was performed in PubMed and Embase and gray literature up to August 17, 2020. A random-effects model was applied to obtain the pooled prevalence of RNA repositive among recovered patients and the prevalence of subjects underlying comorbidity among recurrence cases. The other characteristics were calculated based on the summary data of individual studies.

ResultsA total of 37 studies were included in the final analysis, we have described the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 recurrence cases. Of 2,436 patients recovering from COVID-19 and being discharged, an estimate of 16% (95% CI, 12% to 20%) patients was repositive with SARS-CoV-2 during the follow-up. This proportion was 15% (95% CI, 11% to 18%) for China and 31% (95% CI, 26% to 37%) for Korea. Among recurrence cases, it was estimated 43% (95% CI, 31% to 55%) subjects underlying at least one comorbidity. The estimates for times from disease onset to admission, from admission to discharge, and from discharge to RNA positive conversion were 17.3, 16.7, and 10.5 days, respectively. Conclusions: This study summarized up-to-date evidence from case reports, case series, and observational studies for the characteristic of COVID-19 recurrence cases after discharge. It is recommended to pay attention to follow-up patients after discharge, even if they have been in quarantine.","Hoang, T.",2020-12-24,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.09.05.20189134,2,Tung Hoang,Duy Tan University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.20189134v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.20189134v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
2590,Blood single cell immune profiling reveals the interferon-MAPK pathway mediated adaptive immune response for COVID-19,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is an ongoing global health emergence, but the pathogenesis remains unclear. We revealed blood cell immune response profiles using 5 mRNA, TCR and BCR V(D)J transcriptome analysis with single-cell resolution. Data from 134,620 PBMCs and 83,387 TCR and 12,601 BCR clones was obtained, and 56 blood cell subtypes and 23 new cell marker genes were identified from 16 participants. The number of specific subtypes of immune cells changed significantly when compared patients with controls. Activation of the interferon-MAPK pathway is the major defense mechanism, but MAPK transcription signaling is inhibited in cured patients. TCR and BCR V(D)J recombination is highly diverse in generating different antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the interferon-MAPK pathway and TCR-and BCR-produced antibodies play important roles in the COVID-19 immune response. Immune deficiency or immune over-response may result in the condition of patients with COVID-19 becoming critical or severe.","Huang, L.; Shi, Y.; Gong, B.; Jiang, L.; Liu, X.; Yang, J.; Tang, J.; You, C.; Jiang, Q.; Long, B.; Zeng, T.; Luo, M.; Zeng, F.; Zeng, F.; Wang, S.; Yang, X.; Yang, Z.",2020-03-17,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.15.20033472,1,Zhenglin Yang,"The Key Laboratory for Human Disease Gene Study of Sichuan Province and the Center of Laboratory Medicine, Sichuan Provincial People\'s Hospital, University of ",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20033472v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20033472v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
9749,Global and local mobility as a barometer for COVID-19 dynamics,"The spreading of infectious diseases including COVID-19 depends on human interactions. In an environment where behavioral patterns and physical contacts are constantly evolving according to new governmental regulations, measuring these interactions is a major challenge. Mobility has emerged as an indicator for human activity and, implicitly, for human interactions. Here we study the coupling between mobility and COVID-19 dynamics and show that variations in global air traffic and local driving mobility can be used to stratify different disease phases. For ten European countries, our study shows maximal correlation between driving mobility and disease dynamics with a time lag of 14.6 {+/-} 5.6 days. Our findings suggests that local mobility can serve as a quantitative metric to forecast future reproduction numbers and identify the stages of the pandemic when mobility and reproduction become decorrelated.","Linka, K.; Goriely, A.; Kuhl, E.",2020-08-11,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.13.20130658,2,Ellen Kuhl,Stanford University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.13.20130658v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.13.20130658v2.full.pdf,cc_by,NA

These studies rely on the use of recombinant proteins from the viral genome in order to identify serum antibodies that recognize SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Here, we discuss the cross-reactivity potential of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with the full spike proteins of four other Betacoronaviruses that cause disease in humans, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), we detected the potential cross-reactivity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 towards the four other coronaviruses, with the strongest cross-recognition between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS /MERS-CoV antibodies, as expected based on sequence homology of their respective spike proteins. Further analysis of cross-reactivity could provide informative data that could lead to intelligently designed pan-coronavirus therapeutics or vaccines.","Hicks, J.; Klumpp-Thomas, C.; Kalish, H.; Shunmugavel, A.; Mehalko, J.; Denson, J.-P.; Snead, K.; Drew, M.; Corbett, K.; Graham, B.; Hall, M.

9359,Rapid characterization of the propagation of COVID-19 in different countries,"BACKGROUNDCOVID-19 has spread rapidly, and there are still many characteristics of this new disease to be unveiled. We propose a simple method to calculate a ""figure of merit"" FC to provide an early characterization of the disease status in country C.

METHODSWe use mathematical tools to adjust a Gaussian function to the daily increase of infected patients. Maximum value and full width half maximum of the Gaussian are characteristics of the development of the development of the pandemic in each country. These parameters are supplemented by the testing volume and the mortality rate to produce just one characterizing parameter: FC. In addition, the stability of the Gaussian fits was calculated within an entire week towards the end of the study period. Seventeen different countries were fully considered, while others are considered when discussing particular properties. Data employed is publically available.

FINDINGSFitted Gaussian functions render effective information about the development of COVID-19. The number of critical days vary between 11 (South Korea) and 52 (Mexico). FC varies between 1 (Australia) and 899 (Mexico). The epidemic appears stabilized in some countries and unstable in others. Some large countries are experiencing fast development of the propagation of the disease with high FC. A correlation between low (high) values of the mortality rate (and to some extent FC) and the presence (absence) of BCG vaccination is exposed.

INTERPRETATIONThe adjustment of a Gaussian to daily data of COVID-19 in each country reveals the different propagation dynamics, properly characterized by the parameters proposed here. Testing plays a clear role to control the spread of the disease. Mortality rate spans more than one order of magnitude and is somewhat related to permanent massive BCG vaccination. The figure of merit, FC, introduced here spans more than 2 orders of magnitude which makes it a useful indicator to quickly find out the status of the pandemics in each territory. Geography plays a role: low population density and isolated countries can be efficient in controlling the spread of the disease.

HIGHLIGHTSO_LIAn easy-to-evaluate parameter is defined to rapidly establish the status of the evolution of COVID-19 in any given territory. 17 countries in 4 continents are chosen to apply it and compare different evolutions.
C_LIO_LIThe parameter or figure of merit (FC) is dynamic: it combines testing, mortality rate, and characteristics of the Gaussian function that fits the new daily contagions.
C_LIO_LIFC spans more than two orders of magnitude which makes it a very sensitive indicator to promptly detect second waves or local outbreaks.
C_LIO_LIIt is found that countries with massive BCG vaccination present low COVID-19 mortality rates and low values for FC.

7414,Risk interactions of coronavirus infection across age groups after the peak of COVID-19 epidemic,"Backgroundthe COVID-19 pandemic has incurred significant disease burden worldwide, particularly on elderly population. This study aims to explore how risks of infection interact across age groups using data from South Korea.

MethodsDaily new COVID-19 cases from March 10 to April 30, 2020 were scraped from online open sources. A multivariate vector autoregressive model for time series count data was used to examine the risk interactions across age groups. Case counts from previous days were included as predictors to dynamically examine the change of risk patterns.

ResultsIn South Korea, the risk of coronavirus infection among elderly people was significantly affected by other age groups. An increase of virus infection among people aged 20-39 was associated with a double risk of infection among elderly people. Meanwhile, an increase in virus infection among elderly people was also significantly associated with risks of infection among other age groups. The risks of infection among younger people were relatively unaffected by that of other age groups.

ConclusionsProtecting elderly people from coronavirus infection could not only reduce the risk of infection among themselves but also ameliorate the risks of virus infection among other age groups. Such interventions should be effective and for long term.","Yu, X.",2020-07-06,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.17.20105049,2,Xinhua Yu,University of Memphis,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.17.20105049v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.17.20105049v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.3390/ijerph17145246
17544,Phase 1 trial of a Candidate Recombinant Virus-Like Particle Vaccine for Covid-19 Disease Produced in Plants,"Longer AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThe stabilized prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is produced by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. The trimeric spike glycoproteins are displayed at the surface of self-assembling Virus-Like-Particles that mimic the shape and the size of the virus. The candidate vaccine (CoVLP) administered alone or with AS03 or CpG1018 adjuvants was evaluated in a Phase 1 trial in healthy adults. (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT04450004)

MethodsThe study was a randomized, partially-blinded, prime-boost 21 days apart, dose-escalation Phase 1 study intended to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of CoVLP at three dose levels (3.75 {micro}g, 7.5 {micro}g, and 15 {micro}g) unadjuvanted or adjuvanted with either CpG 1018 or AS03 in 180 SARS-CoV-2 seronegative healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age. Enrollment was staggered for dose-escalation. At each dose level, the vaccine was initially administered to a small number of subjects. Vaccination of the remaining subjects at the same dose level and the next higher vaccine dose level was administered with approval of an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). The same procedure was followed for the second vaccine administration. Monitoring of safety signals was performed throughout the study with pre-determined pausing/stopping rules if there was clear evidence of harmful effects such as severe adverse events (AEs) related to the treatment. The primary endpoints were the safety and tolerability of the vaccine after each dose and the immunogenicity as assessed by neutralizing antibody responses assessed using a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudovirion assay and interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) ELISpot assays at Days 0, 21 and 42. Secondary endpoints were anti-spike antibody responses by ELISA and neutralizing antibodies measured by live virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) assay at Days 0, 21 and 42 and immunogenicity with additional safety and immunogenicity endpoints planned for 6-months following the last vaccination. The anti-spike and neutralizing antibody responses were compared with 23 convalescent serum samples from symptomatic Covid-19 patients. We performed a primary analysis at day 42.

ResultsA total of 180 subjects (102 females: 78 males: average 34.3 years) were recruited to the study and interim safety and immunogenicity data up to day 42 after the first dose are reported here. There was no obvious CoVLP dose effect in safety outcomes for any of the formulations tested and all formulations were generally well-tolerated. Most solicited local and systemic AEs were mild-moderate and transient. Reactogenicity was increased in all adjuvanted formulations and was generally highest in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. Local and systemic adverse events were reported with similar frequency after the first and second doses in subjects who received either CoVLP alone or CoVLP+CpG1018 but increased in both frequency and severity after the second dose in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. CoVLP alone only elicited a weak total anti-spike IgG response at the highest dose level and little-to-no neutralization antibody response, even after the second dose. Cellular responses in the CoVLP alone groups (IFN{gamma} and IL-4) were detectable after the second dose but were still only marginally above background levels. The addition of either adjuvant substantially increased both antibody and cellular responses at most CoVLP dose levels and changes were most pronounced after the second dose. However, a substantial neutralizing antibody response after the first dose was only seen in all CoVLP+AS03 groups. After the second dose, both total anti-spike IgG and neutralizing antibody titers in the CoVLP+AS03 groups were higher than those in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups. The antibody titers achieved were either similar to (CoVLP+CpG1018) or at least 10-times higher (CoVLP+AS03) than those seen in convalescent plasma. Administration of CoVLP with either adjuvant also significantly increased the cellular responses. After 2 doses, both IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 responses were significantly increased in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups. In the CoVLP+AS03 groups, significant increases in the cellular responses were observed after the first dose while IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 increased further in both magnitude and number of subjects responding after the second dose. Again, the cellular responses in the CoVLP+AS03 groups were higher than those seen in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups.

ConclusionThese data demonstrate that CoVLP administered with either CpG1018 or AS03 has a safety profile similar to other candidate vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. When administered with either AS03 or CpG1018, several of the CoVLP dose levels elicited strong humoral and T cell responses after the second dose. When administered with AS03, even the 3.75 g CoVLP dose elicited neutralizing antibody titers that were [~]10-times higher than those observed in individuals recovering from Covid-19 as well as consistent and balanced IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 responses. Although many CoVLP formulations were immunogenic, in the absence of established correlates of protection and given the advantages of dose-sparing in the context of the on-going pandemic, these findings suggest that CoVLP (3.75 g)+AS03 has a good benefit/risk ratio and support the transition of this formulation to studies in expanded populations and to efficacy evaluations

Shorter AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSVirus-like particles (VLP) displaying recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimers were produced by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. This candidate vaccine (CoVLP) was evaluated in healthy adults 18-55 years of age alone or with AS03 or CpG1018 (NCT04450004).

MethodsThis randomized, partially-blinded, two-dose, dose-escalation study assessed CoVLP (3.75, 7.5 or 15 {micro}g/dose) administered intramuscularly alone or with CpG1018 or AS03 in SARS-CoV-2 seronegative adults (18-55 years). Primary endpoints of safety and immunogenicity are reported to day 42. Neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) were assessed using a VSV pseudovirus assay and cellular responses by ELISpot (IFN{gamma}, IL-4).

Results180 subjects (avg.34.3yrs) were recruited. All formulations were well-tolerated but adjuvants increased reactogenicity. Adverse events were highest in the CoVLP+AS03 groups and increased in frequency/severity after dose two. CoVLP alone elicited weak humoral responses but modest cellular responses were detectable after dose two. Both adjuvants increased immunogenicity significantly, particularly after dose two. A significant NtAb response after dose one was only seen in CoVLP+AS03 groups. The vaccine dose had little impact on levels of NtAb responses achieved in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. Both adjuvants also increased IFN{gamma} and IL-4 responses but these cellular responses also tended to be highest in the AS03-adjuvanted groups.

ConclusionCoVLP {+/-} adjuvants was well-tolerated. Several adjuvanted formulations elicited strong humoral and T cell responses after dose 2. Even at the lowest CoVLP+AS03 dose, NtAb titers were [~]10-times higher than in convalescent serum with a balanced IFN{gamma} and IL-4 response. These findings support the transition of CoVLP (3.75g+AS03) to further clinical evaluation.

Research In ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was recognized as the causative agent of COVID-19 in early 2020. Since that time, >150 candidate vaccines are reported to be under development of which 47 have entered clinical trials (https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines accessed Nov 4, 2020). No vaccine to prevent COVID-19 has been licensed yet for either emergency or general use in North America or Europe. We searched PubMed for research articles published between July 2019 and November 4, 2020, using the terms ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""vaccine"", ""clinical trial"" OR ""human"", AND ""phase"". The same terms were used to search ClinTrials.gov. No language restrictions were applied. We identified 10 peer-reviewed studies, describing phase 1 or 1/2 trials using a range of novel (eg: RNA, DNA, non-replicating virus vectored) and more traditional vaccine approaches (eg: inactivated virus or recombinant protein {+/-} adjuvants). None of these candidate vaccines was produced in plants. These reports demonstrate that several different vaccination strategies (typically delivered in two doses 14-28 days apart) are capable of eliciting neutralizing antibody responses. In several cases, vaccine-induced cellular responses against SARS-COV-2 antigens - predominantly the spike (S) protein - can also be demonstrated. Although local and systemic adverse events following vaccination have varied between reports, the trials published to date suggest that each of these candidate vaccines is well-tolerated in the context of an evolving pandemic.

Added value of this studyWe report the results of the first clinical study of CoVLP, a virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine that is produced by transient transfection of Nicotiana benthamiana plants. These VLPs spontaneously assemble at the plant cell membrane and display SARS-COV-2 trimers of stabilized pre-fusion S protein on their surface. The vaccine was administered as two intramuscular doses 21 days apart at three dose levels (S protein content 3.75, 7,5 or 15g) alone or adjuvanted with either CpG1018 or AS03. All formulations were well-tolerated although both adjuvants increased reactogenicity. Humoral (anti-S IgG and neutralizing antibodies) as well as cellular responses (IFNg and IL4 ELISpots) were detectable in almost all subjects who received adjuvanted formulations 21 days after the second dose at all COVLP dose levels. Both antibody and cellular responses were highest in subjects who received AS03-adjuvanted formulations. Even at the lowest dose level (3.75g), the neutralizing antibody titers 21 days after the second dose in subjects who received the AS03-afdjuvanted vaccine were 10-50-fold higher than those seen in subjects recovering from COVID-19 infection.

Implications of all the available evidenceEffective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed to reduce the burden of disease and contribute to ending the global pandemic. Although no immune correlates for SARS-CoV-2 have been defined, it is likely that both arms of the immune system contribute to protection. After two doses of CoVLP (3.75g+AS03), strong humoral and cellular responses were induced supporting the further clinical development of this vaccine.","Ward, B.

16509,"HIV testing by public health centers and municipalities, and new HIV cases during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan","BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 outbreak, medical resources were primarily allocated to COVID-19, which might have reduced facility capacity for HIV testing. Further, people may have opted against HIV testing during this period to avoid COVID-19 exposure. We investigate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV testing and its consequences in Japan.

MethodsWe analysed quarterly HIV/AIDS-related data from 2015 to the second quarter of 2020 using an anomaly detection approach. The data included the number of consultations that public health centers received, the number of HIV tests performed by public health centers or municipalities, and the number of newly reported HIV cases with and without AIDS diagnosis. As sensitivity analyses, we performed the same analysis for two subgroups: men who have sex with men (MSM) and non-Japanese.

FindingsThe number of HIV tests (9,584 vs. 35,908 in the year-before period) and consultations (11,689 vs. 32,565) performed by public health centers significantly declined in the second quarter of 2020, while the proportion of HIV cases with AIDS diagnosis among all HIV cases (36{middle dot}2% vs. 26{middle dot}4%) significantly increased after removing the trend and seasonality effects. The number of HIV cases without AIDS diagnosis numerically decreased (166 vs. 217), although the reduction was not significant. We confirmed similar trend for the MSM and non-Japanese groups.

InterpretationThe current HIV testing system including public health centers misses more HIV cases at the early phase of the infection during the pandemic. Given that the clear epidemiological picture of HIV incidence during the pandemic is still uncertain, continuously monitoring the situation as well as securing sufficient test resources using self-test is essential.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSBefore this study, we searched PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar on Oct 12, 2020, for articles investigated the number of HIV test and HIV cases during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, using the search terms ""novel coronavirus"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"", and ""HIV"" or ""AIDS"", and ""Japan"", with no time restrictions. We found no published work relevant to our study.

Added value of this studyDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, the public health centers and municipalities temporarily suspended facility-based HIV testing to concentrate their limited resources to COVID-19 testing. We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of HIV tests in public health centers and municipalities, and on the number of HIV cases with and without AIDS diagnosis. We confirmed that the number of the test declined in the second quarter (April to June) of 2020, and the proportion of HIV with AIDS diagnosis among all HIV cases increased during the same period.

Implications of all the available evidenceProviding sufficient HIV testing opportunities even during the pandemic, when facility-based testing is challenging, is necessary for better clinical and public health outcomes. Self-testing and home specimen collection (e.g. dried blood spot or oral fluid test) could be a key to fill the gap between the need for HIV testing and the constraints related to the COVID-19 outbreak.","Ejima, K.; Koizumi, Y.; Yamamoto, N.; Rosenberg, M.; Ludema, C.; Bento, A.

5510,Cell-based therapies for COVID-19: A living systematic review,"ObjectiveThis living systematic review aims to provide a timely, rigorous and continuously updated summary of the available evidence on the role of cell-based therapies in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

Data sourcesWe conducted searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature and in a centralised repository in L-OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L-OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L-OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. All the searches covered the period until April 23, 2020 (one day before submission).

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methodsWe adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We searched for randomised trials evaluating the effect of cell-based therapies versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Anticipating the lack of randomised trials directly addressing this question, we also searched for trials evaluating other coronavirus infections, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19. Two reviewers independently screened each study for eligibility.

A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates.

ResultsWe screened 1,043 records but no study was considered eligible.

We identified 61 ongoing studies, including 39 randomised trials evaluating different types of cell-based therapies in COVID-19.

ConclusionsWe did not find any studies that met our inclusion criteria and hence there is no evidence to support or refute the use of cell-based therapies in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. A substantial number of ongoing studies should provide valuable evidence to inform researchers and decision makers in the near future.

9760,"Age-dependent assessment of genes involved in cellular senescence, telomere and mitochondrial pathways in human lung tissue of smokers, COPD and IPF: Associations with SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 ACE2-TMPRSS2-Furin-DPP4 axis","Aging is one of the key contributing factors for chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and other chronic inflammatory lung diseases. Cigarette smoke is a major etiological risk factor that has been shown to alter cellular processes involving mitochondrial function, cellular senescence and telomeric length. Here we determined how aging contribute to the alteration in the gene expression of above mentioned cellular processes that play an important role in the progression of COPD and IPF. We hypothesized that aging may differentially alter the expression of mitochondrial, cellular senescence and telomere genes in smokers and patients with COPD and IPF compared to non-smokers. Total RNA from human lung tissues from non-smokers, smokers, and patients with COPD and IPF were processed and analyzed based on their ages (younger: <55 yrs and older: >55 yrs). NanoString nCounter panel was used to analyze the gene expression profiles using a custom designed codeset containing 112 genes including 6 housekeeping controls (mitochondrial biogenesis and function, cellular senescence, telomere replication and maintenance). mRNA counts were normalized, log2 transformed for differential expression analysis using linear models in the limma package (R/Bioconductor). Data from non-smokers, smokers and patients with COPD and IPF were analyzed based on the age groups (pairwise comparisons between younger vs. older groups). Several genes were differentially expressed in younger and older smokers, and patients with COPD and IPF compared to non-smokers which were part of the mitochondrial biogenesis/function (HSPD1, FEN1, COX18, COX10, UCP2 & 3), cellular senescence (PCNA, PTEN, KLOTHO, CDKN1C, TNKS2, NFATC1 & 2, GADD45A) and telomere replication/maintenance (PARP1, SIRT6, NBN, TERT, RAD17, SLX4, HAT1) target genes. Interestingly, NOX4 and TNKS2 were increased in the young IPF as compared to the young COPD patients. Genes in the mitochondrial dynamics and other quality control mechanisms like FIS1 and RHOT2 were decreased in young IPF compared to their age matched COPD subjects. ERCC1 (Excision Repair Cross-Complementation Group 1) and GADD45B were higher in young COPD as compared to IPF. Aging plays an important role in various infectious diseases. Elderly patients with chronic lung disease and smokers were found to have high incidence and mortality rates in the current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immunoblot analysis in the lung homogenates of smokers, COPD and IPF subjects revealed increased protein abundance of important proteases and spike proteins like TMPRSS2, furin and DPP4 in association with a slight increase in SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 levels. This may further strengthen the observation that smokers, COPD and IPF subjects are more prone to COVID-19 infection. Overall, these findings suggest that altered transcription of target genes that regulate mitochondrial function, cellular senescence, and telomere attrition add to the pathobiology of lung aging in COPD and IPF and other smoking-related chronic lung disease in associated with alterations in SARS-CoV-2 ACE2-TMPRSS2-Furin-DPP4 axis for COVID-19 infection.","Maremanda, K.

11533,Effects of Tocilizumab in Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19: A Quasi-Experimental Study,"ObjectivesCritically ill patients with COVID-19 may suffer from a cytokine release syndrome (CRS) characterized by remarkably high levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6). We assessed the effects of tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, on intra-hospital mortality and development of positive cultures in patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU.

DesignPatients with COVID 19 admitted in the ICU who were treated with tocilizumab plus standard care were enrolled and compared to controls.

SettingCOVID-19 severe disease

PatientsPatients with severe COVID-19 disease admitted in the ICU.

InterventionsTocilizumab 400 mg IV two doses. Standard and intensive medical care as per institutional clinical protocol.

Measures and Main ResultsMain outcome: 1) intra-hospital mortality; Secondary Outcomes: 1) the need for renal replacement therapy, 2) use of antibiotics and positive culture, and 3) inflammatory and oxygenation markers. There was no difference in mortality, need for renal replacement therapy, use of antibiotics or positive cultures between the two groups. The use of corticosteroids was more frequent in the treatment group. Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and WBC (white blood cells) counts declined significantly faster in the treatment group. Oxygenation markers rose significantly higher in patients in the tocilizumab group as compared to controls.

ConclusionTocilizumab was associated with rapid improvement in oxygenation and a faster decrease of CRP and WBC counts in patients with COVID-19 and should be evaluated as rescue therapy for patients with progressive disease","Carvalho, V.; Turon, R.; Goncalves, B.; Ceotto, V.; Kurtz, P.; Righy, C.",2020-07-15,Intensive Care And Critical Care Medicine,10.1101/2020.07.13.20149328,1,Victor Carvalho,"Hospital Niteroi DOr, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20149328v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20149328v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
1696,Estimation of the Time-Varying Reproduction Number of COVID-19 Outbreak in China,"BackgroundThe 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan, China has attracted world-wide attention. As of February 11, 2020, a total of 44730 cases of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were confirmed by the National Health Commission of China.

MethodsThree approaches, namely Poisson likelihood-based method (ML), exponential growth rate-based method (EGR) and stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed dynamic model-based method (SIR), were implemented to estimate the basic and controlled reproduction numbers.

ResultsA total of 71 chains of transmission together with dates of symptoms onset and 67 dates of infections were identified among 5405 confirmed cases outside Hubei as reported by February 2, 2020. Based on this information, we find the serial interval having an average of 4.41 days with a standard deviation of 3.17 days and the infectious period having an average of 10.91 days with a standard deviation of 3.95 days.

ConclusionsThe controlled reproduction number is declining. It is lower than one in most regions of China, but is still larger than one in Hubei Province. Sustained efforts are needed to further reduce the Rc to below one in order to end the current epidemic.","You, C.; Deng, Y.; Hu, W.; Sun, J.; Lin, Q.; Zhou, F.; Pang, C.

19004,Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays for antibody monitoring in natural infection and vaccine trials,"Determinants of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection require the development of well-standardized, reproducible antibody assays to be utilized in concert with clinical trials to establish correlates of risk and protection. This need has led to the appearance of a variety of neutralization assays used by different laboratories and companies. Using plasma samples from COVID-19 convalescent individuals with mild-to-moderate disease from a localized outbreak in a single region of the western US, we compared three platforms for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization: assay with live SARS-CoV-2, pseudovirus assay utilizing lentiviral (LV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) packaging, and a surrogate ELISA test. Vero, Vero E6, HEK293T cells expressing human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), and TZM-bl cells expressing hACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) were evaluated. Live-virus and LV-pseudovirus assay with HEK293T cells showed similar geometric mean titers (GMTs) ranging 141-178, but VSV-pseudovirus assay yielded significantly higher GMT (310 95%CI 211-454; p < 0.001). Fifty percent neutralizing dilution (ND50) titers from live-virus and all pseudovirus assay readouts were highly correlated (Pearson r = 0.81-0.89). ND50 titers positively correlated with plasma concentration of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike and receptor binding domain (RBD) (r = 0.63-0.89), but moderately correlated with nucleoprotein IgG (r = 0.46-0.73). There was a moderate positive correlation between age and spike (Spearmans rho=0.37, p=0.02), RBD (rho=0.39, p=0.013) and nucleoprotein IgG (rho=0.45, p=0.003). ND80 showed stronger correlation with age than ND50 (ND80 rho=0.51 (p=0.001), ND50 rho=0.28 (p=0.075)). Our data demonstrate high concordance between cell-based assays with live and pseudotyped virions.","Sholukh, A. M.; Fiore-Gartland, A.; Ford, E. S.; Hou, Y.; Tse, L. V.; Lempp, F.

6872,Three pictures of COVID-19 behavior in Italy: similar growth and different degrowth,"In this short note, we present an analysis of the data regarding Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Italy. We have used the official database provided by the Italian Civil Protection. Since the total number of people infected by the virus is uncertain, we have considered the trend of ICU patients, ICU patients plus deaths, and finally the sum of hospitalized patients plus the deceased. The growth of the corresponding curves is similar for all the three graphs while the trend after the turning point is completely different. We find that the curve of ICU patients can be a useful tool to monitor the behavior of epidemic and a model to predict the future evolution of COVID-19.","Feoli, A.; Iannella, A.

17100,Childhood asthma outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from the PeARL multi-national cohort.,"ImportanceImportance: The interplay between COVID-19 pandemic and asthma in children is still unclear.

ObjectiveWe evaluated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on childhood asthma outcomes.

DesignThe PeARL multinational cohort included children with asthma and non-asthmatic controls recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared current disease activity with data available from the previous year.

SettingPediatric outpatient clinics.

ParticipantsThe study included 1,054 children with asthma and 505 non-asthmatic controls, aged between 4-18 years, from 25 pediatric departments, from 15 countries globally.

ExposuresCOVID-19 pandemic first wave, starting from the date of the first fatality in the respective country.

Main outcomes and measuresWe assessed the pandemics impact on the frequency of respiratory infections, emergency presentations and hospital admissions in asthmatic versus non-asthmatic participants, controlling for confounding factors including the pandemics duration and the frequency of such acute events during 2019. Using paired analyses, we evaluated the impact of the pandemic on the annualized frequency of asthma attacks and the previously mentioned acute events, asthma control, and pulmonary function in children with asthma, compared to their baseline disease activity, during the preceding year.

ResultsDuring the pandemic, children with asthma experienced fewer upper respiratory tract infections, episodes of pyrexia, emergency visits, hospital admissions, asthma attacks and hospitalizations due to asthma, in comparison to the preceding year. Sixty-six percent of asthmatic children had improved asthma control while in 33% the improvement exceeded the minimally clinically important difference. Pre-bronchodilatation FEV1 and peak expiratory flow rate were also improved during the pandemic.

When compared to non-asthmatic controls, children with asthma were not found to be at increased risk of LRTIs, episodes of pyrexia, emergency visits or hospitalizations during the pandemic. However, an increased risk of URTIs emerged.

Conclusions and relevanceChildhood asthma outcomes, including control, were improved during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, probably because of reduced exposure to asthma triggers and increased treatment adherence. The decreased frequency of acute episodes does not support the notion that childhood asthma may be a risk factor for COVID-19. Furthermore, the potential for improving childhood asthma outcomes through environmental control becomes apparent.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat was the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on childhood asthma outcomes?

FindingsDuring the first wave of the pandemic, children with asthma have experienced improved outcomes, as evidenced by fewer asthma attachks, hospitalizations, improved scores in validated asthma control measures and improved pulmonary function.

MeaningThis is the first study to show a positive impact of COVID-19 pandemic on childhood asthma activity. This is probably the result of reduced exposure to asthma triggers and increased treatment adherence. The decreased frequency of acute episodes does not support the hypothesis that childhood asthma may be a risk factor for COVID-19.","Papadopoulos, N. G.; Mathioudakis, A.

16493,On Modeling of COVID-19 for the Indian Subcontinent using Polynomial and Supervised Learning Regression,"COVID-19, a recently declared pandemic by WHO has taken the world by storm causing catastrophic damage to human life. The novel cornonavirus disease was first incepted in the Wuhan city of China on 31st December 2019. The symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath or breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Since the devastating phenomenon is essentially a time-series representation, accurate modeling may benefit in identifying the root cause and accelerate the diagnosis. In the current analysis, COVID-19 modeling is done for the Indian subcontinent based on the data collected for the total cases confirmed, daily recovered, daily deaths, total recovered and total deaths. The data is treated with total confirmed cases as the target variable and rest as feature variables. It is observed that Support vector regressions yields accurate results followed by Polynomial regression. Random forest regression results in overfitting followed by poor Bayesian regression due to highly correlated feature variables. Further, in order to examine the effect of neighbouring countries, Pearson correlation matrix is computed to identify geographic cause and effect.","Neve, D.; Patel, H.; Dhiman, H.

17194,Saliva as a testing specimen with or without pooling for SARS-CoV-2 detection by multiplex RT-PCR test,"BackgroundSensitive and high throughput molecular detection assays are essential during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The vast majority of the SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays use nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) or oropharyngeal swab (OPS) specimens collected from suspected individuals. However, using NPS or OPS as specimens has apparent drawbacks, e.g. the collection procedures for NPS or OPS specimens can be uncomfortable to some people and may cause sneezing and coughing which in turn generate droplets and/or aerosol particles that are of risk to healthcare workers, requiring heavy use of personal protective equipment. There have been recent studies indicating that self-collected saliva specimens can be used for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 and provides more comfort and ease of use for the patient. Here we report the performance of QuantiVirus SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test using saliva as the testing specimens with or without pooling.

MethodsDevelopment and validation studies were conducted following FDA-EUA and molecular assay validation guidelines. Using SeraCare Accuplex SARS-CoV-2 reference panel, the limit of detection (LOD) and clinical evaluation studies were performed with the QuantiVirus SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test. For clinical evaluation, 85 known positive and 90 known negative clinical NPS samples were tested. Additionally, twenty paired NPS and saliva samples collected from recovering COVID-19 patients were tested and the results were further compared to that of the Abbott m2000 SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay. Results of community collected 389 saliva samples for COVID-19 screening by QuantiVirus SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test were also obtained and analyzed. Moreover, saliva pooling with 6 and 12 samples together were also evaluated.

ResultsThe LOD for the QuantiVirus SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test was confirmed to be 100-200 copies/mL. The clinical evaluation using contrived saliva samples indicated that the positive percentage agreement (PPA) of the QuantiVirus SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test is 100% at 1xLOD, 1.5xLOD and 2.5xLOD. No cross-reactivity was observed for the QuantiVirus SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test with common respiratory pathogens. Testing of clinical samples showed a positive percentage agreement (PPA) of 100% (95% CI: 94.6% to 100%) and a negative percentage agreement (NPA) of 98.9% (95% CI: 93.1% to 99.9%). QuantiVirus SARS CoV-2 multiplex test had 80% concordance rate and no significant difference (p=0.13) in paired saliva and NPS specimens by Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test. Positive test rate was 1.79% for 389 saliva specimens collected from the communities for COVID-19 screening. Preliminary data showed that saliva sample pooling up to 6 samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection is feasible (sensitivity 94.8% and specificity 100%).

ConclusionThe studies demonstrated that the QuantiVirus SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test has a LOD of 200 copies/mL in contrived saliva samples. The clinical performance of saliva-based testing is comparable to that of NPS-based testing. Pooling of saliva specimens for SARS-CoV-2 detection is feasible. Saliva based and high-throughput QuantiVirusSARS-CoV-2 multiplex test offers a highly desirable test during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Sun, Q.; Li, J.; Ren, H.; Pastor, L.; Loginova, Y.; Madej, R.; Taylor, K.; Wong, J.

17018,Clinical Course and Outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Rheumatic Disease Patients on Immunosuppression: A case Cohort Study at a Single Center with a Significantly Diverse Population,"ObjectivesTo determine clinical course and outcomes in rheumatic disease patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and compare results to uninfected patients.

MethodsWe conducted a case cohort study of autoimmune disease patients with COVID-19 (confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 PCR) from 02/01/2020 to 07/31/2020 and compared them in a 1:3 ratio with uninfected patients who were matched based on race, age, sex, and comorbidity index. Patient demographics, clinical course, and outcomes were compared among these patient groups.

ResultsA total of 70 rheumatic disease patients with COVID-19 (mean age, 56.6 years; 64% African American) were identified. The 34 (49%) patients who were hospitalized used oral glucocorticoids more frequently (p<0.01). All 10 patients on anti-TNF medications were treated as outpatients (p<0.01). Those hospitalized with COVID-19 more often required ICU admission (17 (50%) vs 27 (26%), OR=2.78 (95% CI: 1.24 to 6.20)) and intubation (10 (29%) vs 6 (6%), OR=6.67 (95% CI: 2.20 to 20.16)) than uninfected patients. They also had higher mortality rates (6 (18%) vs 3 (3%), OR=7.21 (95% CI: 1.70 to 30.69)). Of the six COVID-19 patients who died, one was of African ancestry (p=0.03).

ConclusionsRheumatic disease patients infected with COVID-19 were more likely to require ICU admission, ventilation, and died more frequently versus uninfected patients with autoimmune disease. Patients on anti-TNF medications were hospitalized less frequently while those on chronic glucocorticoids were hospitalized more frequently. These findings have important implications for medication choice in rheumatic disease patients during the ongoing spread of COVID-19.","Arleo, T. L.; Tong, D. C.; Shabto, J. M.; O'keefe, G.

11021,Two-Stage Adaptive Pooling with RT-qPCR for COVID-19 Screening,"We propose two-stage adaptive pooling schemes, 2-STAP and 2-STAMP, for detecting COVID-19 using real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test kits. Similar to the Tapestry scheme of Ghosh et al., the proposed schemes leverage soft information from the RT-qPCR process about the total viral load in the pool. This is in contrast to conventional group testing schemes where the measurements are Boolean. The proposed schemes provide higher testing throughput than the popularly used Dorfmans scheme. They also provide higher testing throughput, sensitivity and specificity than the state-of-the-art non-adaptive Tapestry scheme. The number of pipetting operations is lower than state-of-the-art non-adaptive pooling schemes, and is higher than that for the Dorfmans scheme. The proposed schemes can work with substantially smaller group sizes than non-adaptive schemes and are simple to describe. Monte-Carlo simulations using the statistical model in the work of Ghosh et al. (Tapestry) show that 10 infected people in a population of size 961 can be identified with 70.86 tests on the average with a sensitivity of 99.50% and specificity of 99.62%. This is 13.5x, 4.24x, and 1.3x the testing throughput of individual testing, Dorfmans testing, and the Tapestry scheme, respectively.","Heidarzadeh, A.; Narayanan, K.

13228,Drawing transmission graphs for COVID-19 in the perspective of network science,"When we consider a probability distribution about how many COVID-19 infected people will transmit the disease, two points become important. First, there should be super-spreaders in these distributions/networks and secondly, the Pareto principle should be valid in these distributions/networks. When we accept that these two points are valid, the distribution of transmission becomes a discrete Pareto distribution, which is a kind of power law. Having such a transmission distribution, then we can simulate COVID-19 networks and find super-spreaders using the centricity measurements in these networks. In this research, in the first we transformed a transmission distribution of statistics and epidemiology into a transmission network of network science and secondly we try to determine who the super-spreaders are by using this network and eigenvalue centrality measure. We underline that determination of transmission probability distribution is a very important point in the analysis of the epidemic and determining the precautions to be taken.","Gursakal, N.; Batmaz, B.; Aktuna, G.",2020-08-14,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.08.11.20172908,1,Gamze Aktuna,"Hacettepe University, Public Health Institute",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.20172908v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.20172908v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1017/S0950268820002654

6286,The landscape of host genetic factors involved in infection to common viruses and SARS-CoV-2,"IntroductionHumans and viruses have co-evolved for millennia resulting in a complex host genetic architecture. Understanding the genetic mechanisms of immune response to viral infection provides insight into disease etiology and therapeutic opportunities.

MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive study including genome-wide and transcriptome-wide association analyses to identify genetic loci associated with immunoglobulin G antibody response to 28 antigens for 16 viruses using serological data from 7924 European ancestry participants in the UK Biobank cohort.

ResultsSignals in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region dominated the landscape of viral antibody response, with 40 independent loci and 14 independent classical alleles, 7 of which exhibited pleiotropic effects across viral families. We identified specific amino acid (AA) residues that are associated with seroreactivity, the strongest associations presented in a range of AA positions within DR{beta}i at positions 11, 13, 71, and 74 for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV), Human Herpes virus 7, (HHV7) and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV). Genome-wide association analyses discovered 7 novel genetic loci outside the HLA associated with viral antibody response (P<5.0x10-8), including FUT2 (19q13.33) for human polyomavirus BK (BKV), STING1 (5q31.2) for MCV, as well as CXCR5 (11q23.3) and TBKBP1 (17q21.32) for HHV7. Transcriptome-wide association analyses identified 114 genes associated with response to viral infection, 12 outside of the HLA region, including ECSCR: P=5.0*10-15 (MCV), NTN5: P=1.1x10-9 (BKV), and P2RY13: P=1.1x10-8 EBV nuclear antigen. We also demonstrated pleiotropy between viral response genes and complex diseases; from autoimmune disorders to cancer to neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions.

ConclusionsOur study confirms the importance of the HLA region in host response to viral infection and elucidates novel genetic determinants beyond the HLA that contribute to host-virus interaction.","Kachuri, L.; Francis, S.

19124,SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity in renal transplant and haemodialysis patients treated with convalescent plasma,"BackgroundWhen patients with chronic kidney disease are infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) they can face two specific problems: Virus-specific immune responses may be impaired and remdesivir, an antiviral drug described to shorten the time to recovery, is contraindicated. Antiviral treatment with convalescent plasma could be an alternative treatment option.

MethodsIn this case series we present two kidney transplant recipients and two patients dependent on haemodialysis who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and received convalescent plasma. Antibodies against the spike 1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 were determined sequentially by IgG ELISA and neutralization assay and specific T cell responses by interferon-gamma ELISpot.

ResultsPrior to treatment, in three patients antibodies were undetectable by ELISA (ratio < 1.1), corresponding to low neutralizing antibody titers ([&le;] 1:40). One patient was also negative to the ELISpot and two showed weak responses. After convalescent plasma treatment we observed an increase of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies (IgG ratio and neutralization titer) and of specific T cell responses. After intermittent clinical improvement one kidney transplant recipient again developed typical symptoms at day 12 after treatment and received a second cycle of convalescent plasma treatment. Altogether, three patients clinically improved and could be discharged from hospital. However, one multimorbid female in her early eighties deceased.

ConclusionsOur data suggest that the success of convalescent plasma therapy may only be temporary in patients with chronic kidney disease; which requires an adaptation of the treatment regimen. Close monitoring after treatment is needed for this patient group.","Lindemann, M.; Krawczyk, A.; Dolff, S.; Konik, M.; Rohn, H.; Platte, M.; Thuemmler, L.; Schwarzkopf, S.; Schipper, L.; Bormann, M.; Van De Sand, L.; Breyer, M.; Klump, H.; Knop, D.; Lenz, V.; Temme, C.; Dittmer, U.; Horn, P.

The mechanism of transmission is agent-to-agent contact, using parameters reported for Corona COVID-19 pandemic. The main goal of the ALPS simulation is analyze effects of preventive measures - imposition and lifting of lockdown norms - on the rates of infections, fatalities and recoveries. The model assumptions and choices represent a balance between competing demands of being realistic and being efficient for real-time inferences. The model provides quantification of gains in reducing casualties by imposition and maintenance of restrictive measures in place.","Srivastava, A.",2020-11-30,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.29.20084699,2,Anuj Srivastava,Florida State University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.20084699v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.20084699v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
15848,"Evaluation of the accuracy, ease of use and limit of detection of novel, rapid, antigen-detecting point-of-care diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2","BackgroundReliable point-of-care (POC) diagnostics not requiring laboratory infrastructure could be a game changer in the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the Global South. We assessed performance, limit of detection and ease-of-use of three antigen-detecting, rapid POC tests (Ag-RDT) for SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsThis prospective, multi-centre diagnostic accuracy study recruited participants suspected to have SARS-CoV-2 in Germany and the UK. Paired nasopharyngeal swabs (NP) or NP and/or oropharyngeal swabs (OP) were collected from participants (one for clinical RT-PCR and one for Ag-RDT). Performance of each of three Ag-RDTs was compared to RT-PCR overall, and according to predefined subcategories e.g. cycle threshold (CT)-value, days from symptoms onset, etc. In addition, limited verification of the analytical limit-of-detection (LOD) was determined. To understand the usability a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire and ease-of-use (EoU) assessment were performed.

ResultsBetween April 17th and August 25th, 2020, 2417 participants were enrolled, with 70 (3.0%) testing positive by RT-PCR. The best-performing test (SD Biosensor, Inc. STANDARD Q) was 76x6% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 62x8-86x4) sensitive and 99x3% (CI 98x6-99x6) specific. A sub-analysis showed all samples with RT-PCR CT-values <25 were detectable by STANDARD Q. The test was considered easy-to-use (SUS 86/100) and suitable for POC. Bioeasy and Coris showed specificity of 93x1% (CI 91x0%-94x8%) and 95x8% (CI 93x4%-97x4%), respectively, not meeting the predefined target of [&ge;]98%.

ConclusionThere is large variability in performance of Ag-RDT with SD Biosensor showing promise. Given the usability at POC, this test is likely to have impact despite imperfect sensitivity; however further research and modelling are needed.","Krueger, L.

MethodsWe examined Coronavirus Disease-19 incidence following school reopening in Florida.

ResultsWe found that counties teaching physically had 1.2-fold incidence increase in elementary schools and 1.3-fold increase in high schools, while counties teaching remotely had no increase.

ConclusionsOur results suggest that counties teaching physically could consider teaching remotely, especially in high school, until it is safe to teach physically.

What was knownSchools reopened in August-September 2020, with some teaching remotely, since the effect of physical reopening on COVID-19 infections is unclear.

What we addedcounties teaching physically had 1.2-fold incidence increase in elementary schools and 1.3-fold increase in high schools. This suggests that counties teaching physically could consider teaching remotely instead, especially at the high school level.","Miron, O.; Yu, K.-H.; Wilf-Miron, R.; Kohane, I.; Davidovitch, N.",2020-10-27,Pediatrics,10.1101/2020.10.24.20218321,1,Oren Miron,Ben Gurion University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.24.20218321v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.24.20218321v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
6664,Prediction of 2019-nCov in Italy based on PSO and inversion analysis,"Novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) has swept the world, and all of the world have been harmful. This article makes prediction and suggestions for the Italy. Up to March 11, 2020, 2019-nCov thoroughly broke out in Italy with over 10,000 confirmed cases notwithstanding the gradually block of the country since March 9, 2020. Estimation of possible infection population and prospective suggestion of handling spread based on exist data are of crucial importance. Considering of the biology parameters obtained based on Chinese clinical data in Wuhan, other scholars work and real spread feature of 2019-nCov in Italy, we built a more applicable model called SEIJR with log-normal distributed time delay to forecast the trend of spreading. Adopting Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), we estimated the early period average spreading velocity (0) and conducted inversion analysis of time point (T0) when the virus first hit the Italy. Based on fixed 0 and T0, we then obtained the average spreading velocity 1 after the lock by PSO. For the aim of offering expeditious advice, we generated the prediction trends with different  which we considered would be helpful in addressing the infection. Not only solved the complex, nondifferentiable equation of epidemic model, our research also performs well in inversion analysis based on PSO which conveys informative outcomes for further discussion on precatious action. To conclude, the first day of spread is around February 1, 2020 with the early period average spreading velocity 0=0.330 which is higher than most cities in China except Wuhan. After locking the country and attaching great attention to public precaution, the 1 sharply descended to 0.278, indicting the effectiveness of these measures. Furthermore, in order to cope the disease before mid-April, take actions to control the under 0.25 is necessary.

20072,Modelling COVID -19 Transmission in a Hemodialysis Centre Using Simulation Generated Contacts Matrices,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly threatening to the patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on intermittent hemodialysis and their care providers. Hemodialysis patients who receive life-sustaining medical therapy in healthcare settings, face unique challenges as they need to be at a dialysis unit three or more times a week, where they are confined to specific settings and tended to by dialysis nurses and staff with physical interaction and in close proximity. Despite the importance and critical situation of the dialysis units, modelling studies of the SARS-CoV-2 spread in these settings are very limited. In this paper, we have used a combination of discrete event and agent-based simulation models, to study the operations of a typical large dialysis unit and generate contact matrices to examine outbreak scenarios. We present the details of the contact matrix generation process and demonstrate how the simulation calculates a micro-scale contact matrix comprising the number and duration of contacts at a micro-scale time step. We have used the contacts matrix in an agent-based model to predict disease transmission under different scenarios. The results show that micro-simulation can be used to estimate contact matrices, which can be used effectively for disease modelling in dialysis and similar settings.","Tofighi, M.; Asgary, A.; Merchant, A.

6543,"Severe obesity is associated with higher in-hospital mortality in a cohort of patientswith COVID-19 in the Bronx, New York","Background & AimsNew York is the current epicenter of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The underrepresented minorities, where the prevalence of obesity is higher, appear to be affected disproportionally. Our objectives were to assess the characteristics and early outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Bronx and investigate whether obesity is associated with worse outcomes.

MethodsThis retrospective study included the first 200 patients admitted to a tertiary medical center with COVID-19. The electronic medical records were reviewed at least three weeks after admission. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality.

Results200 patients were included (female sex: 102, African American: 102). The median BMI was 30 kg/m2. The median age was 64 years. Hypertension (76%), hyperlipemia (46.2%), and diabetes (39.5%) were the three most common comorbidities. Fever (86%), cough (76.5%), and dyspnea (68%) were the three most common symptoms. 24% died during hospitalization (BMI <25 kg/m2: 31.6%, BMI 25-34 kg/m2: 17.2%, BMI[&ge;]35 kg/m2: 34.8%, p= 0.03). The multivariate analysis for mortality, demonstrates that BMI[&ge;]35 kg/m2 (OR: 3.78; 95% CI: 1.45 - 9.83; p=0.006), male sex (OR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.25 - 5.98; p=0.011) and increasing age (OR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.13 - 2.63; p=0.011) were independently associated with higher in hospital mortality. Similar results were obtained for the outcomes of increasing oxygen requirement and intubation.

ConclusionsIn this cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a minority-predominant population, severe obesity, increasing age, and male sex were associated with higher in-hospital mortality and in general worse in-hospital outcomes.","Palaiodimos, L.; Kokkinidis, D.
