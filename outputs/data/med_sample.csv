9892,Deregulated cellular circuits driving immunoglobulins and complement consumption associate with the severity of COVID-19,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 infection causes an abrupt response by the host immune system, which is largely responsible for the pathogenesis and outcome of COVID-19. We aimed to investigate which specific responses from either cellular or humoral immunity associate to severity and progression of COVID-19.

MethodsA cohort of 276 patients classified in mild, moderate and severe, was studied. Peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations were quantified by flow cytometry, and immunoglobulins and complement proteins by nephelometry.

ResultsAt admission, dramatic lymphopenia of T, B and NK cells associated to severity. However, only the proportion of B cells increased, while T and NK cells appeared unaffected. Accordingly, the number of plasma cells and circulating follicular helper T cells (cTfh) increased, but levels of IgM, IgA and IgG were unaffected. When degrees of severity were considered, IgG was lower in severe patients, suggesting an IgG consumption by complement activation or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Activated CD56-CD16+ NK-cells, which mediate ADCC, were increased. Regarding complement, C3 and C4 protein levels were higher in mild and moderate, but not in severe patients, compared to healthy donors. Moreover, IgG and C4 decreased from day 0 to day 10 in patients who were hospitalized for more than two weeks, but not in patients who were discharged earlier.

ConclusionOur study provides important clues to understand the immune response observed in COVID-19 patients, which is probably related to viral clearance, but also underlies its pathogenesis and severity. This study associates for the first time COVID-19 severity with an imbalanced humoral immune response characterized by excessive consumption of IgG and C4, identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention.","Marcos-Jimenez, A.; Sanchez-Alonso, S.; Alcaraz-Serna, A.; Esparcia, L.; Lopez-Sanz, C.; Sampedro-Nunez, M.; Mateu-Albero, T.; Sanchez-Cerrillo, I.; Martinez-Fleta, P.; Gabrie, L.; Del Campo, L.; Lopez-Trascasa, M.; Martin-Gayo, E.; Calzada, M.; Castaneda, S.; De La Fuente, H.; Gonzalez-Alvaro, I.; Sanchez-Madrid, F.; Munoz-Calleja, C.; Alfranca, A.",2020-06-17,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.15.20131706,1,Cecilia Munoz-Calleja,"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.20131706v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.20131706v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
2754,Spatial Visualization of Cluster-Specific COVID-19 Transmission Network in South Korea During the Early Epidemic Phase,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been rapidly spreading throughout China and other countries including South Korea. As of March 12, 2020, a total number of 7,869 cases and 66 deaths had been documented in South Korea. Although the first confirmed case in South Korea was identified on January 20, 2020, the number of confirmed cases showed a rapid growth on February 19, 2020 with a total number of 1,261 cases with 12 deaths based on the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).

MethodUsing the data of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea that are publicly available from the KCDC, this paper aims to create spatial visualizations of COVID-19 transmission between January 20, 2020 and February 19, 2020.

ResultsUsing spatial visualization, this paper identified two early transmission clusters in South Korea (Daegu cluster and capital area cluster). Using a degree-weighted centrality measure, this paper proposes potential super-spreaders of the virus in the visualized clusters.

ConclusionCompared to various epidemiological measures such as the basic reproduction number, spatial visualizations of the cluster-specific transmission networks and the proposed centrality measure may be more useful to characterize super-spreaders and the spread of the virus especially in the early epidemic phase.","Park, J.

9226,"Clinical evaluation of self-collected saliva by RT-qPCR, direct RT-qPCR, RT-LAMP, and a rapid antigen test to diagnose COVID-19","BackgroundThe clinical performance of six molecular diagnostic tests and a rapid antigen test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were clinically evaluated for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in self-collected saliva.

MethodsSaliva samples from 103 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (15 asymptomatic and 88 symptomatic) were collected on the day of hospital admission. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva was detected using a quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) laboratory-developed tes (LDT), a cobas SARS-CoV-2 high-throughput system, three direct RT-qPCR kits, and reverse-transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). Viral antigen was detected by a rapid antigen immunochromatographic assay.

ResultsOf the 103 samples, viral RNA was detected in 50.5-81.6% of the specimens by molecular diagnostic tests and an antigen was detected in 11.7% of the specimens by the rapid antigen test. Viral RNA was detected at a significantly higher percentage (65.6-93.4%) in specimens collected within 9 d of symptom onset compared to that of specimens collected after at least 10 d of symptom onset (22.2-66.7%) and that of asymptomatic patients (40.0-66.7%). Viral RNA was more frequently detected in saliva from males than females.

ConclusionsSelf-collected saliva is an alternative specimen diagnosing COVID-19. LDT RT-qPCR, cobas SARS-CoV-2 high-throughput system, direct RT-qPCR except for one commercial kit, and RT-LAMP showed sufficient sensitivity in clinical use to be selectively used according to clinical settings and facilities. The rapid antigen test alone is not recommended for initial COVID-19 diagnosis because of its low sensitivity.

Key pointsSix molecular diagnostic tests showed equivalent and sufficient sensitivity in clinical use in diagnosing COVID-19 in self-collected saliva samples. However, a rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen test alone is not recommended for use without further study.","Ikeda, M.; Imai, K.; Tabata, S.; Miyoshi, K.; Mizuno, T.; Murahara, N.; Horiuchi, M.; Kato, K.; Imoto, Y.; Iwata, M.; Mimura, S.; Ito, T.; Tamura, K.; Kato, Y.",2020-06-08,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.06.20124123,1,Kazuo Imai,Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.06.20124123v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.06.20124123v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1128/jcm.01438-20
8707,Association between NSAIDs use and adverse clinical outcomes among adults hospitalised with COVID-19 in South Korea: A nationwide study,"BACKGROUNDNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may exacerbate COVID-19 and worsen associated outcomes by upregulating the enzyme that SARS-CoV-2 binds to enter cells. However, to our knowledge, no study has examined the association between NSAID use and the risk of COVID-19-related outcomes among hospitalised patients.

METHODSWe conducted a population-based cohort study using South Koreas nationwide healthcare database, which contains data of all subjects who received a test for COVID-19 (n=69,793) as of April 8, 2020. We identified a cohort of adults hospitalised with COVID-19, where cohort entry was the date of hospitalisation. NSAIDs users were those prescribed NSAIDs in the 7 days before and including the date of cohort entry and non-users were those not prescribed NSAIDs during this period. Our primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital death, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation use, and sepsis; our secondary outcome was cardiovascular or renal complications. We conducted logistic regression analysis to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using inverse probability of treatment weighting to minimize potential confounding.

FINDINGSOf 1,824 adults hospitalised with COVID-19 (mean age 490 years, standard deviation 19 0 years; female 59%), 354 were NSAIDs users and 1,470 were non-users. Compared with non-use, NSAIDs use was associated with increased risks of the primary composite outcome (OR 1 65, 95% CI 1-21-2-24) and of cardiovascular or renal complications (OR 187, 95% CI 1-25-2-80). Our main findings remained consistent when we extended the exposure ascertainment window to include the first three days of hospitalisation (OR 187, 95% CI 1 06-3 29).

INTERPRETATIONUse of NSAIDs, compared with non-use, is associated with worse outcomes among hospitalised COVID-19 patients. While awaiting the results of confirmatory studies, we suggest NSAIDs be used with caution among patients with COVID-19 as the harms associated with their use may outweigh their benefits in this population.

10454,Impact of public health interventions on the COVID-19 epidemic: a stochastic model based on data from an African island,"A stochastic model was created to simulate the impact of various healthcare measures on the COVID-19 epidemic. Travel restrictions and point of entry or exit screening help to delay the onset of the outbreak by a few weeks. Population surveillance is critical to detect the start of community transmission early and to avoid a surge in cases. Contact reduction and contact tracing are key interventions that can help to control the outbreak. To promptly curb the number of new cases, countries should diagnose patients using a highly sensitive test.","Nuckchady, D.",2020-06-26,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.22.20134130,1,Dooshanveer Nuckchady,Dr. A.

18253,Evaluation of the Panbio rapid antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 in primary health care centers and test sites.,"BackgroundRapid antigen tests (Ag-RDT) are emerging as new diagnostic tools for COVID-19 and real-world evaluations are needed to establish their performance characteristics.

Main objectiveTo evaluate the accuracy of the Panbio Ag-RDT at primary health care (PHC) centers and test sites in symptomatic patients and close contacts, using the Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test as the gold standard.

MethodsThis was a prospective diagnostic study conducted in four PHC centers and two test sites in Mallorca, Spain. Consecutive patients older than 18 years, attending the sites for RT-PCR testing either for suggestive symptoms of infection or a close contact, were included. Two nasopharyngeal samples were collected, one for RT-PCR and the other was processed on-site using the Panbio rapid antigen test kit for SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated using RT-PCR as the reference, and the predictive values using the pretest probability results for each analyzed group.

ResultsA total of 1369 participants were included; mean age 42.5 {+/-} 14.9 years and 54.3% women. The overall prevalence was 10.2%. Most participants (70.6%) presented within 5 days of the onset of symptoms or close contact, and more than 70% had high viral loads. The overall sensitivity was of 71.4% (95% CI: 63.1%, 78.7%), the specificity of 99.8% (95% CI: 99.4%, 99.9%), the positive predictive value of 98.0% (95% CI: 93.0%, 99.7%) and a negative predictive value of 96.8% (95% CI: 95.7%, 97.7%). The sensitivity was higher in symptomatic patients, in those arriving within 5 days since symptom onset and in those with high viral load.

ConclusionAg-RDT had relatively good performance characteristics in suspected symptomatic patients within five days since the onset of symptoms. However, our results concludes that a negative Ag-RDT in these settings must be considered as presumptive.","Bulilete, O.; Lorente, P.; Leiva, A.; Carandell, E.; Oliver, A.; Rojo, E.; Pericas, P.; Llobera, J.; Covid-19 Primary Care Research Group,  ",2020-11-16,Primary Care Research,10.1101/2020.11.13.20231316,1,Alfonso Leiva,"Primary Health Care Research Unit, Balearic Public Health Service, Mallorca, Spain",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.13.20231316v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.13.20231316v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
8386,Monitoring and forecasting the number of reported and unreported cases of the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil using Particle Filter,"In this paper, we combine algorithm of Liu & West for the Particle Filter (PF) with SIRU-type epidemic model to monitor and forecast cases of Covid-19 in Brazil from February up to September. We filter the number of cumulative reported cases and estimate model parameters and more importantly unreported infectious cases (asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious individuals). The parameters under study are related to the attenuation factor of the transmission rate and the fraction of asymptomatic infectious becoming reported as symptomatic infectious. Initially, the problem is analysed through Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based simulations to provide initial guesses, which are then refined by means of PF simulations. Subsequently, two additional steps are performed to verify the capability of the adjusted model to predict and forecast new cases. According to the results, the pandemic peak is expected to take place in mid-June 2020 with about 25,000 news cases per day. As medical and hospital resources are limited, this result shows that public health interventions are essential and should not be relaxed prematurely, so that the coronavirus pandemic is controlled and conditions are available for the treatment of the most severe cases.","Dutra, J.

24257,Vaccine effectiveness of the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 against SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents of Long-Term Care Facilities (VIVALDI study),"BackgroundThe effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in frail older adults living in Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) is uncertain. We estimated protective effects of the first dose of ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 vaccines against infection in this population.

MethodsCohort study comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated LTCF residents in England, undergoing routine asymptomatic testing (8 December 2020 - 15 March 2021). We estimated the relative hazard of PCR-positive infection using Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusting for age, sex, prior infection, local SARS-CoV-2 incidence, LTCF bed capacity, and clustering by LTCF.

ResultsOf 10,412 residents (median age 86 years) from 310 LTCFs, 9,160 were vaccinated with either ChAdOx1 (6,138; 67%) or BNT162b2 (3,022; 33%) vaccines. A total of 670,628 person days and 1,335 PCR-positive infections were included. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for PCR-positive infection relative to unvaccinated residents declined from 28 days following the first vaccine dose to 0{middle dot}44 (0{middle dot}24, 0{middle dot}81) at 28-34 days and 0{middle dot}38 (0{middle dot}19, 0{middle dot}77) at 35-48 days. Similar effect sizes were seen for ChAdOx1 (aHR 0{middle dot}32 [0{middle dot}15-0{middle dot}66] and BNT162b2 (aHR 0{middle dot}35 [0{middle dot}17, 0{middle dot}71]) vaccines at 35-48 days. Mean PCR cycle threshold values were higher, implying lower infectivity, for infections [&ge;]28 days post-vaccination compared with those prior to vaccination (31{middle dot}3 vs 26{middle dot}6, p<0{middle dot}001).

InterpretationThe first dose of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines was associated with substantially reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection risk in LTCF residents from 4 weeks to at least 7 weeks.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe conducted a systematic search for studies which evaluated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine effectiveness in residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) published between 01/01/2020 and 11/03/2021. We used variations of search terms for """"COVID-19"""" AND """"vaccine effectiveness"""" OR """"vaccine efficacy"""" AND """"care homes"""" OR """"long term care facilities"""" OR """"older people"""" on Ovid MEDLINE and MedRxiv. We identified one pre-print article regarding LTCFs in Denmark, which reported that a single dose of BNT162b was ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents, however, participants received the second vaccine dose 24 days following the first dose on average, which is likely to be too soon to capture the protective effects of a single vaccine dose. Additionally, we identified two pre-print reports of studies evaluating vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection and hospitalisation amongst older adults in the community. The first of these found 81% vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-related hospitalisation at 28-34 days following a single dose of BNT162b or ChAdOx1 in [&ge;]80-year-olds. The second of these found vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection of 60% at 28-34 days and 73% at 35+ days following a single dose of ChAdOx1 in [&ge;]70-year-olds. No studies were identified that focused on the effectiveness of a single vaccine dose against infection amongst LTCF residents at more than 4 weeks post-vaccination, a particularly important question in the context of the UK policy decision to extend the dose interval beyond 3 weeks.

Added value of this studyWe conducted a prospective cohort study of 10,412 residents aged [&ge;]65 years, from 310 LTCFs across England, to investigate the protective effect of the first dose of the ChAdOx1 and BNT162b vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection in frail older adults. We retrieved results from routine monthly PCR testing, as well as outbreak and clinical testing for SARS-CoV-2, thereby capturing data on asymptomatic as well as symptomatic infections, which we linked to vaccination records. We estimated vaccine effectiveness to be 56% (19-76%) at 28-34 days, and 62% (23-81%) at 35-48 days following a single dose of ChAdOx1 or BNT162. Our findings suggest that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection is substantially reduced from 28 days following the first dose of either vaccine and that this effect is maintained for at least 7 weeks, with similar protection offered by both vaccine types. We also found that PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values, which are negatively associated with the ability to isolate virus, were significantly higher in infections occurring at [&ge;] 28days post vaccination compared to those occurring in the unvaccinated period, suggesting that vaccination may reduce onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in breakthrough infections. To the best of our knowledge, our findings constitute the first real-world evidence on vaccine effectiveness against infection for ChAdOx1, in any age group. We can also infer that both vaccines are effective against the B.1.1.7 variant, because our analysis period coincided with the rapid emergence of B.1.1.7 in England during the second wave of the pandemic.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur findings add to the growing body of evidence on the protective effect of the BNT162b vaccines in residents of LTCFs and demonstrate the effectiveness of ChAdOx1 in this vulnerable population. Evaluating single-dose vaccine efficacy has become increasingly important in light of extended dosing intervals that have been implemented in order to maximise vaccine coverage across high-risk groups. Further work is required to evaluate the effectiveness of the first vaccine dose after 8-12 weeks, as well as following the second dose, and to evaluate the long-term impact of vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 infection, transmission and mortality in LTCFs. This will inform policy decisions regarding the ongoing need for disease control measures in LTCF such as visitor restrictions, which continue to have a detrimental impact on the wellbeing of residents, their relatives, and staff.

13459,"Water, Sanitation, Hygiene (WASH) or others? - a global analysis on determinants of Covid-19 pandemic","Socioeconomic achievement of WASH (access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene) services are being acknowledged as anticipatory actors, indispensable in safeguarding health during this Covid-19 pandemic. However, on a global scale, it is currently not clear whether deprivation or non-obtainability of which of the various WASH services are closely related to Covid-19 dynamics and up to which degree. We have analysed data (March - June 2020) related to five Covid-19 indicators for most of the countries in the world with indicators of safe water, sanitation and hygiene to understand this. We have found a strong positive correlation between lesser effects of Covid-19 and better access to safe water, sanitation as well as hygiene throughout this time for most of the indicators. However, some indicators show the opposite nature of the relationship, for which we have given probable explanation accordingly. The hypothesis of an inversely proportional association between Covid-19 and poor WASH facilities on a global scale is confirmed in this study. We propose that this study should be perceived as an expanded comprehensive view on the complexities of WaSH-Covid19 interrelationships, which could help to shape an agenda for research into some unanswered questions.

18452,Social patterning and stability of intention to accept a COVID-19 vaccine in Scotland: Will those most at risk accept a vaccine?,"Vaccination is central to controlling COVID-19. Its success relies on having safe and effective vaccines and also on high levels of uptake by the public over time. Addressing questions of population-level acceptability, stability of acceptance and sub-population variation in acceptability are imperative. Using a prospective design, a repeated measures two-wave online survey was conducted to assess key sociodemographic variables and intention to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. The first survey (time 1) was completed by 3436 people during the period of national lockdown in Scotland and the second survey (n = 2016) was completed two months later (time 2) when restrictions had been eased. At time one, 74% reported being willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Logistic regression analyses showed that there were clear sociodemographic differences in intention to accept a vaccine for COVID-19 with intention being higher in participants of white ethnicity in comparison to Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) groups, and in those with higher income levels and higher education levels. Intention was also higher in those who were  shielding due to underlying medical conditions.

5025,Analysis of SteraMist ionized hydrogen peroxide technology in the sterilization of N95 respirators and other PPE: a quality improvement study,"ObjectiveThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers, including filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) such as N95 masks. These masks are normally intended for single use, but their sterilization and subsequent reuse could substantially mitigate a world-wide shortage.

DesignQuality assurance.

SettingA sealed environment chamber installed in the animal facility of an academic medical center.

InterventionsOne to five sterilization cycles using ionized hydrogen peroxide (iHP), generated by SteraMist(R) equipment (TOMI; Frederick, MD).

Main outcome measuresPersonal protective equipment, including five N95 mask models from three manufacturers, were evaluated for efficacy of sterilization following iHP treatment (measured with bacterial spores in standard biological indicator assemblies). Additionally, N95 masks were assessed for their ability to efficiently filter particles down to 0.3{micro}m and for their ability to form an airtight seal using a quantitative fit test. Filtration efficiency was measured using ambient particulate matter at a university lab and an aerosolized NaCl challenge at a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) pre-certification laboratory.

ResultsThe data demonstrate that N95 masks sterilized using SteraMist iHP technology retain function up to five cycles, the maximum number tested to date. Some but not all PPE could also be sterilized using an iHP environmental chamber, but pre-treatment with a handheld iHP generator was required for semi-enclosed surfaces such as respirator hoses.

ConclusionsA typical iHP environment chamber with a volume of ~80 m3 can treat ~7000 masks per day, as well as other items of PPE, making this an effective approach for a busy medical center.","Cramer, A.; Plana, D.; Yang, H.

To assess changes in immunoglobulin (Ig) and neutralising antibodies (nAbs) in exposed participants.

SettingTwo acute National Health Service (NHS) hospitals within the East Midlands region of England.

BackgroundThe UK has been one of the most severely affected countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Transmission from healthcare workers to the wider community is a potential major vector for spread of SARS-CoV-2 which is not well described in the current literature.

MethodsHealthcare workers (HCW) were recruited from two Hospitals within the East Midlands of England and underwent serial blood sampling for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (both nucleocapsid and spike protein for IgG, IgM and IgA) between 20 April and 30 July 2020, with the presence of neutralising antibodies (nAbs) assessed for positive participants. Cohabitees of the volunteers were invited to attend testing in July -August 2020 and underwent identical serological testing as the HCWs.

Results633 healthcare professionals were recruited. 178 household contacts of 137 professionals volunteered for the study. 18% of healthcare professionals (115 out of 633) tested as seropositive during the study period, compared to an estimated seroprevalence of 7% within the general population. The rate of symptomatic COVID-19 was 27.5% compared to an asymptomatic rate of 15.1%. Rates of positivity declined across the study period for all immunoglobulins (overall positivity from 16.7% to 6.9%).

7.2% of the cohabitees tested as seropositive. 58 cohabitees lived with a serologically positive HCW; this group had a seropositive rate of 15.5%, compared to 2.5% of cohabitees without a seropositive HCW, a six-fold increase in risk (Odds ratio 7.16 95% CI 1.86 to 27.59), p = 0.0025). Given the observed decay rates and data from Public Health England, we estimate that the proportion of seropositive cohabitees living with a seropositive HCW at the height of the first wave could have been as high as 44%.

110 out of 115 (95.7%) HCWs and 12 out of 13 (92.3%) cohabitees who tested positive developed detectable nAbs. 56.5% (65 out of 115) of SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs developed a neutralising titre with an IC50[&ge;]1/300; no cohabitee achieved this level..

ConclusionsTransmission of SARS-CoV-2 between healthcare professionals and their home contacts appears to be a significant factor of viral transmission, but, even accounting for the decline in seropositivity over time, less than 44% of adult cohabitees of seropositive healthcare workers became seropositive. Routine screening and priority vaccination of both healthcare professionals and their close contacts should be implemented to reduce viral transmission from hospitals to the community.

SUMMARY BOXESO_ST_ABSSection 1: What is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSO_LIHealthcare workers (HCWs) have increased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the general population due, at least in part, to high levels of occupational exposure.
C_LIO_LIIgA, IgM and IgG are detectable for most patients after 11 days post SARS-CoV-2 infection but all decline in the weeks following SAR-CoV-2 exposure.
C_LIO_LIRates of transmission to healthcare workers, and therefore subsequent transmission to their close contacts, may be reduced with effective PPE.
C_LI

Section 2: What this study addsO_LIThe amount of neutralising antibodies formed may be dependent on IgG response as it is much lower among seropositive cohabitees than seropositive healthcare workers.
C_LIO_LINHS Healthcare workers had a far greater seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the general population.
C_LIO_LICohabitees of positive healthcare workers have a 6-fold increased risk of developing serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the general population.
C_LIO_LIDespite this increased risk, transmission at home is less than 50% even from highly exposed healthcare workers, but remains an important potential vector of transmission from hospitals to the wider community.

Research into contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for articles published between January 1 2020 and January 27, 2021 with the terms """"Covid-19"""", """"healthcare workers"""", and """"transmission"""" """"home {NOT nursing} or household"""". We did not restrict our search by language or type of publication. We identified 38 studies of which only one assessed the prevalence among HCW households using Canadian national databases. Our PubMed search yielded only one serological study within the German Healthcare system, which suggested very low transmission from healthcare workers to their close cohabitees.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the largest longitudinal serological cohort study assessing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection from the UK healthcare environment to the home (n = 633 healthcare workers, 178 cohabitees). Our findings showed that serological evidence within the HCW was high with 18% of healthcare professionals (115 out of 633) tested as seropositive during the study period, compared to an estimated seroprevalence of 7% within the general population. A cohabitee of a seropositive HCW had a six-fold increase of being seropositive themselves compared to a baseline rate of 2.5%. Despite this increased risk, transmission at home is less than 50% even from highly exposed healthcare workers, but remains an important potential vector of transmission from hospitals to the wider community. Rates of positivity declined across the study period for all immunoglobulins (overall positivity from 16.7% to 6.9%). Given the observed decay rates and data from Public Health England, we estimate that the proportion of seropositive cohabitees living with a seropositive HCW at the height of the first wave could have been as high as 44%.

Implications of all available evidenceUnderstanding the transmission during the first wave from the healthcare setting into the home and the extent of such transmissions is essential to understand containment strategies of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants or to understand viral transmission of future respiratory viruses. NHS workers appeared to be at an increased risk of contracting of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the HCWs of other nations; we hypothesise that this may be related to a scarcity of appropriate personal protective equipment during the initial wave of SARS-CoV-2. Healthcare workers (HCWs) have increased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the general population. An infected HCW, whether symptomatic or not, appears to be a significant bridge for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to their close home contacts.","Craxford, S.; Nightingale, J.; Ikram, A.; Marson, B.

3824,On predicting the novel COVID-19 human infections by using Infectious Disease modelling method in the Indian State of Tamil Nadu during 2020,"Since the introduction of the novel Corona Virus (The COVID-19) to the Chinese city Wuhan in the Hubei province during the late December 2019, the effectiveness of the deadly disease, its human infection, spreading severity and the mortality rate of the infection has been an issue of debate. The outbreak of the virus along the time has become a massive threat to the global public health security and has been declared as a pandemic. Accounting the radical number of increases in the infected cases and the death due to COVID-19 infections around the globe, there is a need to predict the infections among the people by making proper optimization and using various Infectious Disease modelling (IDM) methods, in order to challenge the outcome. In comparison with previous diseases like SARS and Ebola viruses, the new corona virus (COVID-19) infections are infectious during the incubation period. In addition to that, naturally produced droplets from humans (e.g. droplets produced by breathing, talking, sneezing, coughing) and Person-to-person contact transmission are reported to be the foremost ways of transmission of novel corona virus. By considering the above two factors, a modified SEIR (Susceptibility-Exposure-Infection-Recovery) method have been used for predicting the spread of the infections in the state of Tamil Nadu which is located in the southern part of India. Further, we have utilized the current surveillance data from Health and Family Welfare Department - Government of Tamil Nadu to accurately predict the spreading trend of the infection on a state level.","Ayubali, A.

24154,"Characterizing the disproportionate burden of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern among essential workers in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada","ImportanceThe emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VOC) across North America has been associated with concerns of increased COVID-19 transmission. Characterizing the distribution of VOCs can inform development of policies and programs to address the prevention needs of disproportionately affected communities.

ObjectiveWe compared per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases (overall and VOC) from February 3, 2021 to March 10, 2021, across neighborhoods in the health regions of Toronto and Peel, Ontario, by proportion of the population working in essential services and income.

DesignDescriptive epidemiological analysis, integrating COVID-19 surveillance and census data. Per-capita daily epidemic curves were generated using 7-days rolling averages for cases and deaths. Cumulative per-capita rates were determined using census-reported population of each neighbourhood.

SettingThe study setting was the city of Toronto and the region of Peel (the City of Brampton, Mississauga, and Caledon), Canadas largest cities with a combined population of 4.3 million. This area of Canada has had one of the highest incident rates of COVID-19 throughout the pandemic.

ParticipantsWe used person-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 community cases (N=22,478) and census data for neighborhood-level attributes.

ExposuresWe stratified neighbourhoods, i.e., dissemination areas which represent geographic areas of approximately 400-700 individuals, into tertiles by ranking the proportion of population in each neighbourhood working in essential services (health, trades, transport, equipment, manufacturing, utilities, sales, services, agriculture); and the per-person equivalent household income.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)The primary outcomes were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases overall and VOC positives by neighbourhood.

ResultsDuring the study period, VOC cases emerged faster in groups with lowest income (growth rate 43.8%, 34.6% and 21.6% by income tertile from lowest to highest), and most essential work (growth rate 18.4%, 30.8% and 50.8% by tertile from lowest tertile of essential workers to highest tertile of essential workers).

Conclusions and RelevanceThe recent introduction of VOC in a large urban area has disproportionately affected neighbourhoods with the most essential workers and lowest income levels. Notably, this is consistent with the increased burden of non-VOC COVID-19 cases suggesting shared risk factors. To date, restrictive public health strategies have been of limited impact in these communities suggesting the need for complementary and well-specified supportive strategies to address disparities and overall incidence of both VOC and non-VOC COVID-19.","Chagla, Z.; Ma, H.; Sander, B.; Baral, S.; Mishra, S.",2021-03-26,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.03.22.21254127,1,Zain Chagla,McMaster University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.22.21254127v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.22.21254127v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
13662,"SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection in pregnant women: characterization of symptoms and syndromes predictive of disease and severity through real-time, remote participatory epidemiology.","BackgroundFrom the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, pregnant women have been considered at greater risk of severe morbidity and mortality. However, data on hospitalized pregnant women show that the symptom profile and risk factors for severe disease are similar to those among women who are not pregnant, although preterm birth, Cesarean delivery, and stillbirth may be more frequent and vertical transmission is possible. Limited data are available for the cohort of pregnant women that gave rise to these hospitalized cases, hindering our ability to quantify risk of COVID-19 sequelae for pregnant women in the community.

ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that pregnant women in community differ in their COVID-19 symptoms profile and disease severity compared to non-pregnant women. This was assessed in two community-based cohorts of women aged 18-44 years in the United Kingdom, Sweden and the United States of America.

Study designThis observational study used prospectively collected longitudinal (smartphone application interface) and cross-sectional (web-based survey) data. Participants in the discovery cohort were drawn from 400,750 UK, Sweden and US women (79 pregnant who tested positive) who self-reported symptoms and events longitudinally via their smartphone, and a replication cohort drawn from 1,344,966 USA women (162 pregnant who tested positive) cross-sectional self-reports samples from the social media active user base. The study compared frequencies of symptoms and events, including self-reported SARS-CoV-2 testing and differences between pregnant and non-pregnant women who were hospitalized and those who recovered in the community. Multivariable regression was used to investigate disease severity and comorbidity effects.

ResultsPregnant and non-pregnant women positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection drawn from these community cohorts were not different with respect to COVID-19-related severity. Pregnant women were more likely to have received SARS-CoV-2 testing than non-pregnant, despite reporting fewer clinical symptoms. Pre-existing lung disease was most closely associated with the severity of symptoms in pregnant hospitalized women. Heart and kidney diseases and diabetes were additional factors of increased risk. The most frequent symptoms among all non-hospitalized women were anosmia [63% in pregnant, 92% in non-pregnant] and headache [72%, 62%]. Cardiopulmonary symptoms, including persistent cough [80%] and chest pain [73%], were more frequent among pregnant women who were hospitalized. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea and vomiting, were different among pregnant and non-pregnant women who developed severe outcomes.

ConclusionsAlthough pregnancy is widely considered a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes, and was associated with higher propensity for testing, the profile of symptom characteristics and severity in our community-based cohorts were comparable to those observed among non-pregnant women, except for the gastrointestinal symptoms. Consistent with observations in non-pregnant populations, comorbidities such as lung disease and diabetes were associated with an increased risk of more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Pregnant women with pre-existing conditions require careful monitoring for the evolution of their symptoms during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Molteni, E.; Astley, C. M.; Ma, W.; Sudre, C. H.; Magee, L.

16825,Correlation of COVID-19 Mortality with Clinical Parameters in an Urban and Suburban Nursing Home Population,"Importance and ObjectiveCOVID-19 has a high mortality rate amongst nursing home populations (26.4% nationally and 28.3% in New Jersey). Identification of factors influencing mortality in COVID-19 positive nursing home populations may help direct physicians towards appropriate glycemic, blood pressure, weight, kidney function, lipid, thyroid, and hematologic management to reduce COVID-19 mortality.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsRetrospective cross-sectional study of patients in two nursing home facilities (one urban, one suburban) from 3/16/2020 to 7/13/2020 with positive COVID-19 PCR assays. Age, race, sex, lipids, hematologic parameters, body mass index, blood pressure, thyroid function, albumin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and hemoglobin A1c were correlated with COVID-19 mortality by chi-squared analysis.

Main Outcome and Results56 patients met the inclusion criteria for the study. Mortality was 14.3% while the New Jersey nursing home average mortality rate was 28.3% as of August 2020. Our patient cohort had a 49.5% reduction in mortality compared to the state average.

In our overall cohort, none of the clinical parameters correlated with COVID-19 mortality using chi-squared analysis. In the 56 patient cohort, average clinical and laboratory findings were 74.0 years, 62.5% female, 28.5% uncontrolled hypertension, BMI 25.6, hemoglobin A1c 6.4, TSH 2.4, vitamin B12 568.3, folate 12.4, iron 47.8, total iron binding capacity 271.8, hemoglobin 11.6, albumin 3.5, triglycerides 100.3, total cholesterol 133.5, HDL 40.9, and BUN to Creatinine ratio 22.2:1. Logistic multivariate regression analyses failed to demonstrate clinically significant correlation with COVID-19 mortality.

In the urban nursing home, BUN to creatinine ratio exceeding 20:1 was the only factor that showed statistical significance to COVID-19 mortality (p = 0.03). In the suburban nursing home, age over 80 was the only clinical factor demonstrating statistical significance to COVID-19 mortality (p = 0.003).

Conclusions and RelevanceIn our COVID-19 positive nursing home patients, no one parameter was clinically significant in the overall 56-patient cohort; however, mortality in our population was 14.3% compared to New Jerseys 28.3%, a 49.5% reduction in mortality. Rigorous control of the aforementioned clinical parameters may have contributed to this reduction in mortality. Further research requires analysis of more nursing home patients to determine whether rigorous control of clinical parameters decreases mortality from COVID-19.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat clinical parameters lead to a lower mortality rate in nursing home patients with COVID-19?

FindingsIn this cross-sectional analysis of 56 SARS-CoV-2 positive New Jersey nursing home residents from March to July 2020, controlling hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, hematologic and lipid panels to recommended levels yielded a mortality rate of 14.3%, a 49.5% reduction from the 28.3% mortality rate of COVID-19 in New Jersey nursing homes.

MeaningMaintaining rigorous control of clinical parameters in nursing home populations may account for a decreased mortality rate of COVID-19.","Kirby, R. S.; Kirby, J.

7049,Chest Computed Tomography Findings in Asymptomatic Patients with COVID-19,"BackgroundLittle is known about the damage to the respiratory system in asymptomatic patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

ObjectiveHerein, we evaluated the findings of chest computed tomography (CT) and radiography in patients with COVID-19 who were asymptomatic.

MethodsWe retrospectively investigated patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 but who did not show any symptoms. Among the 139 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized, 10 (7.2%) were asymptomatic. Their chest CT and radiographic findings were analyzed.

ResultsIn the results, all patients (100%) had ground glass opacity (GGO) on chest CT. Further, the GGO lesions were predominantly distributed peripherally and posteriorly in all patients. In 9 (90%) patients, the GGO lesions were combined with reticular opacity. Air-bronchogram due to bronchiolectasis surrounded by GGO was observed in 8 patients (80%). Additionally, the lung lesions were dominant on the right side in all patients.

ConclusionsIn conclusion, considering our results that the lung is affected in asymptomatic patients, it will be necessary to extend the indications of COVID-19 testing for effective management of COVID-19 during the pandemic.","Chang, M.

6945,Modelling the evolution of COVID-19 in high-incidence European countries and regions: estimated number of infections and impact of past and future intervention measures,"A previously developed mechanistic model of COVID-19 transmission has been adapted and applied here to study the evolution of the disease and the effect of intervention measures in some European countries and territories where the disease had major impact. A clear impact of the major intervention measures on the reproduction number (Rt) has been found in all studied countries and territories, as already suggested by the drop in the number of deaths over time. Interestingly, the impact of such major intervention measures seems to be the same in most of these countries. The model has also provided realistic estimates of the total number of infections, active cases and future outcome. While the predictive capabilities of the model are much more uncertain before the peak of the outbreak, we could still reliably predict the evolution of the disease after a major intervention by assuming the afterwards reproduction number from current study. More challenging is to foresee the long-term impact of softer intervention measures, but this model can estimate the outcome of different scenarios and help planning changes in the implementation of control measures in a given country or region.","Fernandez-Recio, J.",2020-05-19,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.09.20096735,2,Juan Fernandez-Recio,ICVV-CSIC,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.09.20096735v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.09.20096735v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.3390/jcm9061825
24259,Molecular beacons allow specific RT-LAMP detection of B.1.1.7 variant SARS-CoV-2,"Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, several SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants of concern have appeared and spread throughout the world. Detection and identification of these variants is important to understanding and controlling their rapid spread. Current detection methods for a particularly concerning variant, B.1.1.7, require expensive qPCR machines and depend on the absence of a signal rather than a positive indicator of variant presence. Here we report an assay using a pair of molecular beacons paired with reverse transcription loop mediated amplification to allow isothermal amplification from saliva to specifically detect B.1.1.7 and other variants which contain a characteristic deletion in the gene encoding the viral spike protein. This assay is specific, affordable and allows multiplexing with other SARS-CoV-2 LAMP primer sets.","Sherrill-Mix, S.; Van Duyne, G. D.; Bushman, F.

24461,Estimating the asymptomatic proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population: Analysis of a nationwide serosurvey in the Netherlands,"BackgroundThe proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive persons who are asymptomatic - and whether this proportion is age-dependent - are still open research questions. Because an unknown proportion of reported symptoms among SARS-CoV-2 positives will be attributable to another infection or affliction, the observed, or  crude proportion without symptoms may underestimate the proportion of persons without symptoms that are caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsBased on a large population-based serological study comprising test results on seropositivity and self-reported symptom history conducted in April/May 2020 in the Netherlands (n=3147), we estimated the proportion of reported symptoms among those persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 that is attributable to this infection, where the set of relevant symptoms fulfills the ECDC case definition of COVID-19, using inferential methods for the attributable risk (AR). Generalised additive regression modelling was used to estimate the age-dependent relative risk (RR) of reported symptoms, and the AR and asymptomatic proportion (AP) were calculated from the fitted RR.

ResultsUsing age-aggregated data, the estimated AP was 70% (95% CI: 65-77%). The estimated AP decreased with age, from 80% (95% CI: 67-100%) for the <20 years age-group, to 55% (95% CI: 48-68%) for the 70+ years age-group.

ConclusionWhereas the  crude AP represents a lower bound for the proportion of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 without COVID-19 symptoms, the AP as estimated via an attributable risk approach represents an upper bound. Age-specific AP estimates can inform the implementation of public health actions such as targetted virological testing and therefore enhance containment strategies.","Mcdonald, S.

We find that the initial spread is characterized by a doubling time of about 5 days. We implement a model to forecast the future spread under different scenarios. The model predicts that, if significant containment measures are not taken, a large fraction of the population will be infected with COVID-19, with the peak of the epidemic expected at the end of May and intensive care units having largely exceeded capacity. We analyzed scenarios implementing strong containment measures, similar to those imposed in Europe. The model predicts that an immediate implementation of strong containment measures (on the 19th of April) will significantly reduce the death count. We assess the negative consequences of these measures being implemented with a delay, or not being sufficiently stringent.","Pigolotti, S.; Chiuchiu, D.; Villa Martin, P.; Bhat, D.",2020-04-22,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.20.20071977,1,Simone Pigolotti,Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.20071977v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.20071977v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
19741,Risk of Stress/Depression and Functional Impairment in Denmark Immediately Following a COVID-19 Shutdown,"BackgroundThis study aimed to investigate the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown (March-April 2020) on risk for stress/depression and functional impairment in a representative sample of adult individuals in Denmark, and whether the impact of lockdown was heterogeneous across living situation.

MethodsUsing a representative, randomly drawn sample from the complete Danish adult population interviewed in March 2 to April 13, 2020 (n=2,836) and again in July 2020 (n=1,526, 54% retention rate), we study how the imposed lockdown announced March 11 following the onset of the first Danish wave of COVID-19 infections affected mental wellbeing. We use the World Health Organization Five Well-being Index (WHO-5) and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) to capture wellbeing and functioning. Using covariate adjusted ordinary least squares linear probability models and exploiting variation in the timing of responses occurring just before and just after the introduction of lockdown, we compare respondents before lockdown to respondents that answered during lockdown, as well to answers in re-interviews in July.

ResultsWe find reduced depressive symptoms among adults immediately after the shutdown, concentrated in adults with children living at home. Measures of functional impairment also decline immediately after the March shutdown among adults with children living at home. Impairment intensified for the entire sample between March and July, but depressive symptoms remained at lower rate in July.

ConclusionsFindings in Denmark indicate that living with children at home may have, in the short term, buffered the potential mental health sequelae of the COVID-19 shutdown.","Andersen, L.

4765,Estimating COVID-19 outbreak risk through air travel,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly across the globe during the first several months of 2020, resulting in a pandemic. Substantial, non-discriminatory limitations have been imposed on air travel to inhibit further spread of the virus. However, as disease prevalence and incidence decreases, more specific control measures will be sought so that commercial air travel can operate yet not impose a high threat of COVID-19 resurgence. We considered the risk posed by different locations to initiate a resurgence of COVID-19 at such times.

MethodsWe use modelled global air travel data for October (just before a second wave of COVID-19 might be expected) and population density to analyse the risk posed by 1364 airports to initiate a COVID-19 outbreak. We use a probabilistic, branching-process based approach that considers the volume of air travelers between airports and the R0 of each location, scaled by population density. This exercise is performed globally as well as specifically for two potentially vulnerable locations: Africa and India.

ResultsWe show that globally, many of the airports posing the highest risk are in China and India. An outbreak of COVID-19 in Africa is most likely to originate in a passenger travelling from Europe. On the other hand, the highest risk to India is from domestic travellers. Our results are robust to changes in the underlying epidemiological assumptions.

ConclusionsVariation in flight volumes and destinations creates a non-uniform distribution of the risk different airports pose to resurgence of a COVID-19 outbreak. We suggest the method presented here as a tool for the estimation of this risk. Our method can be used to inform efficient allocation of resources, such as tests identifying infected passengers, so that they could be differentially deployed in various locations.","Daon, Y.; Thompson, R.

5727,"Estimates of the ongoing need for social distancing and control measures post-""""lockdown"""" from trajectories of COVID-19 cases and mortality.","By 29th April 2020, COVID-19 had caused more than 3 million cases across more than 200 countries. And most countries with significant outbreaks had introduced social distancing or """"lockdown"""" measures to reduce viral transmission. So the key question now is when, how, and to what extent, these measures can be lifted.

By fitting regression models to publically available data on daily numbers of newly-confirmed cases and mortality, trajectories, doubling times and reproduction number (R0) were estimated both before and under the control measures. These data ran up to 29th April 2020, and covered 73 countries that had provided sufficient data for modelling.

The estimates of R0, before lockdown, based on these data were broadly consistent with those previously published at between 2.0 and 3.7 in the countries with the largest number of cases available for analysis (USA, Italy, Spain, France and UK). There was little evidence to suggest that the restrictions had reduced R far below 1 in many places, with France having the most rapid reductions - R0 0.77 (95%CI 0.68-0.87), based on cases and 0.78 (95%CI 0.68-0.88) based on mortality.

Intermittent lockdown has been proposed as a means of controlling the outbreak while allowing periods of increase freedom and economic activity. These data suggest that few countries could have even one week per month unrestricted without seeing resurgence of the epidemic. Similarly, restoring 20% of the activity that has been prevented by the lockdowns looks difficult to reconcile with preventing the resurgence of the disease in most countries.","Lonergan, M.; Chalmers, J.",2020-05-05,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.26.20080994,2,Mike Lonergan,University of Dundee,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.20080994v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.20080994v2.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1183/13993003.01483-2020
25143,Identification of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in seroprevalence studies among vaccinated populations,"ImportanceIdentification of SARS-CoV-2 infection via antibody assays is important for monitoring natural infection rates. Most antibody assays cannot distinguish natural infection from vaccination.

ObjectiveTo assess the accuracy of a nucleocapsid-containing assay in identifying natural infection among vaccinated individuals.

DesignA longitudinal cohort comprised of healthcare workers (HCW) in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area was enrolled. Two rounds of seroprevalence studies separated by one month were conducted from 11/2020-1/2021. Capillary blood from round 1 and 2 was tested for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins with a qualitative chemiluminescent ELISA (spike-only assay). In a subsample of participants (n=82) at round 2, a second assay was performed that measured IgGs reactive to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (nucleocapsid-containing assay). Round 1 biospecimen collections occurred prior to vaccination in all participants. Vaccination status at round 2 was determined via self-report.

SettingThe Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota metropolitan area.

ParticipantsHCW age 18-80 years.

ExposuresRound 1 recent SARS-CoV-2 infection assessed via a spike-only assay and participant self-report.

OutcomesRound 2 SARS-CoV-2 infection assessed via the nucleocapsid-containing assay. Area under the curve (AUC) was computed to determine the discriminatory ability of round 2 IgG reactivity to nucleocapsid for identification of recent infection determined during round 1

ResultsParticipants had a mean age of 40 (range=23-66) years, 83% were female, 46% reported vaccination prior to the round 2 testing. Round 1 seroprevalence was 9.5%. Among those not recently infected, when comparing vaccinated vs. unvaccinated individuals, elevated levels of spike 1 (p<0.001) and spike 2 (p=0.01) were observed while nucleocapsid levels were not statistically significantly different (p=0.90). Among all participants, nucleocapsid response predicted recent infection with an AUC(95%CI) of 0.93(0.88,0.99). Among individuals vaccinated >10 days prior to antibody testing, the specificity of the nucleocapsid-containing assay was 92% and while the specificity of the spike-only assay was 0%.

Conclusions and RelevanceAn IgG assay identifying reactivity to nucleocapsid protein is an accurate predictor of natural infection among vaccinated individuals while a spike-only assay performed poorly. In the era of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, seroprevalence studies monitoring natural infection will require assays that do not rely on spike-protein response alone.","Demmer, R.

Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort in HCWs who had a high-risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected subject without PPE. Daily symptoms were self-reported for 30 days, nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR were performed at inclusion and at days 3, 5, 7 and 12, SARS-CoV-2 serology was assessed at inclusion and at day 30. Confirmed infection was defined by positive RT-PCR or seroconversion, and possible infection by one general and one specific symptom for two consecutive days. Results: Between February 5th and May 30th, 2020, 154 HCWs were enrolled within 14 days following one high-risk exposure to either a hospital patient (70/154; 46.1%) and/or a colleague (95/154; 62.5%). At day 30, 25.0% had a confirmed infection (37/148; 95%CI, 18.4%; 32.9%), and 43.9% (65/148; 95%CI, 35.9%; 52.3%) had a confirmed or possible infection. Factors independently associated with confirmed or possible SARS-CoV-2 infection were being a pharmacist or administrative assistant rather than being from medical staff (adjusted OR (aOR)=3.8, CI95%=1.3;11.2, p=0.01), and exposure to a SARS-CoV-2-infected patient rather than exposure to a SARS-CoV-2-infected colleague (aOR=2.6, CI95%=1.2;5.9, p=0.02). Among the 26 HCWs with a SARS-CoV-2-positive nasopharyngeal swab, 7 (26.9%) had no symptom at the time of the RT-PCR positivity. Conclusions: The proportion of HCWs with confirmed or possible SARS-CoV-2 infection was high. There were less occurrences of high-risk exposure with patients than with colleagues, but those were associated with an increased risk of infection.","Tubiana, S.; Burdet, C.; Houhou, N.; Thy, M.; Manchon, P.; Blanquart, F.; Charpentier, C.; Guedj, J.; Alavoine, L.; Behillil, S.; Leclercq, A.; Lucet, J.-C.; Yazdanpanah, Y.; Attia, M.; Demeret, C.; Rose, T.; Bielicki, J.

20646,The Conundrum of Giglio Island: unraveling the dynamics of an apparent resistance to COVID-19. A descriptive study,"ObjectivesDespite an extensive risk of exposure to COVID-19, the residents of Giglio Island, Italy, did not develop any symptom of SARS-CoV-2. The present study aims to characterize the nature of exposure and to describe the local population dynamics underlying its apparent resistance to COVID-19.

MethodsWe conducted seroprevalence screening from April 29 to May 3, 2020 across the three main settlements on the island. We invited the adult resident population, present on the island to undergo testing by rapid serologic assay and to provide a sample of saliva for molecular validation. We monitored the participation through the official municipality residents list. Serologic testing was performed using a COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test while molecular analyses were carried out by Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene).

ResultsA total of 634 residents out of 748 (84.8%) present at the time, and 89 non-residents underwent serological testing. 364 males and 359 females with a median age of 58.5 years. The serological screening identified one positive, asymptomatic subject. The Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests did not yield any positive result.

ConclusionDespite extensive exposure to SARS-CoV-2, only one new asymptomatic infection occurred in this population. This may be due to unknown protective factors or chance. On the basis of this first descriptive study, using its population as a reference model, further investigations will be conducted to characterize the summer period exposure and to test the advanced hypotheses, focusing on the evaluation of a possible cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 from exposure to endemic viruses.","Bognanni, A.; Schiaffino, A.; Pimpinelli, F.; Donzelli, S.; Celesti, I.; Strano, S.; Solari, E.; Schiaffino, G.; Solari, G.; Solari, D.; Delbue, S.; Rigoni, M.; Nollo, G.; Muti, G.; Muti Schunemann, G.; Schunemann, H.; Blandino, G.; Morrone, A.; Muti, P.",2021-01-09,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.01.08.20248948,1,Paola Muti,"McMaster University, Universita degli Studi di Milano",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.08.20248948v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.08.20248948v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.csbj.2021.02.008
25327,Why Women Choose At-Home Abortion via Teleconsultation in France?: A Mixed-Method Study on Drivers of Telemedicine Abortion,"ObjectivesIn face of the COVID-19 health emergency, France has allowed medical abortions to be performed by teleconsultation until 9 weeks of gestation. In an attempt to understand the demand and main drivers of telemedicine abortion, we analysed the requests that Women on Web (WoW), an online telemedicine abortion service operating worldwide, received from France throughout 2020.

MethodsWe conducted a parallel convergent mixed-method study among 809 consultations received from France at WoW between 1 January and 31 December 2020. We performed a cross-sectional study of data obtained from the WoW consultation survey and a manifest content analysis of anonymised email correspondence of 140 women consulting with WoW helpdesk from France.

ResultsWe found that women encounter macro-level, individual-level, and provider-level constraints while trying to access abortion in France. The preferences and needs over secrecy (46.2%), privacy (38.3%), and comfort (34.9%) are among the most frequent reasons for women from France to choose telemedicine abortion through WoW. The COVID-19 pandemic seems to be an important driver for resorting to telemedicine (30.6%). The lockdowns seem to have had an impact on the number of consultations received at WoW from France, increasing from 60 in March to 128 in April during the first lockdown and from 54 in October to 80 in November during the second lockdown.

ConclusionsThe demand for at-home medical abortion via teleconsultation increased in France during the lockdowns. However, drivers of telemedicine abortion are multi-dimensional and go beyond the conditions unique to the pandemic. Given the various constraints women continue to encounter in accessing safe abortion, telemedicine can help meet womens preferences and needs for secrecy, privacy and comfort, while facilitating improved access to and enabling more person-centred abortion care.

19453,Social Media Insights Into US Mental Health Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic. A Longitudinal Twitter Analysis (JANUARY-APRIL 2020),"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented mitigation efforts that disrupted the daily lives of millions. Beyond the general health repercussions of the pandemic itself, these measures also present a significant challenge to the worlds mental health and healthcare systems. Considering traditional survey methods are time-consuming and expensive, we need timely and proactive data sources to respond to the rapidly evolving effects of health policy on our populations mental health. Significant pluralities of the US population now use social media platforms, such as Twitter, to express the most minute details of their daily lives and social relations. This behavior is expected to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, rendering social media data a rich field from which to understand personal wellbeing.

PurposeBroadly, this study answers three research questions: RQ1: What themes emerge from a corpus of US tweets about COVID-19?; RQ2: To what extent does social media use increase during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic?; and RQ3: Does sentiment change in response to the COVID-19 pandemic?

MethodsWe analyzed 86,581,237 public domain English-language US tweets collected from an open-access public repository in three steps1. First, we characterized the evolution of hashtags over time using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling. Second, we increased the granularity of this analysis by downloading Twitter timelines of a large cohort of individuals (n = 354,738) in 20 major US cities to assess changes in social media use. Finally, using this timeline data, we examined collective shifts in public mood in relation to evolving pandemic news cycles by analyzing the average daily sentiment of all timeline tweets with the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) sentiment tool2.

ResultsLDA topics generated in the early months of the dataset corresponded to major COVID-19 specific events. However, as state and municipal governments began issuing stay-at-home orders, latent themes shifted towards US-related lifestyle changes rather than global pandemic-related events. Social media volume also increased significantly, peaking during stay-at-home mandates. Finally, VADER sentiment analysis sentiment scores of user timelines were initially high and stable, but decreased significantly, and continuously, by late March.

Discussion & ConclusionOur findings underscore the negative effects of the pandemic on overall population sentiment. Increased usage rates suggest that, for some, social media may be a coping mechanism to combat feelings of isolation related to long-term social distancing. However, in light of the documented negative effect of heavy social media usage on mental health, for many social media may further exacerbate negative feelings in the long-term. Thus, considering the overburdened US mental healthcare structure, these findings have important implications for ongoing mitigation efforts.","Valdez, D.; Ten Thij, M.; Bathina, K. C.; Rutter, L.

19521,SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 hospitalised patients in Switzerland: a prospective cohort profile,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, which emerged in China in late 2019, rapidly spread across the world causing several million victims in 213 countries. Switzerland was severely hit by the virus, with 43000 confirmed cases as of September 1st, 2020.

AimIn cooperation with the Federal Office of Public Health, we set up a surveillance database in February 2020 to monitor hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in addition to their mandatory reporting system.

MethodsPatients hospitalised for more than 24 hours with a positive PCR test, from 20 Swiss hospitals, are included. Data collection follows a custom Case Report Form based on WHO recommendations and adapted to local needs. Nosocomial infections were defined as infections for which the onset of symptoms started more than 5 days after the patients admission date.

ResultsAs of September 1st, 2020, 3645 patients were included. Most patients were male (2168 - 59.5%),and aged between 50 and 89 years (2778 - 76.2%), with a median age of 68 (IQR 54-79). Community infections dominated with 3249 (89.0%) reports. Comorbidities were frequently reported: hypertension (1481 - 61.7%), cardiovascular diseases (948 - 39.5%), and diabetes (660 - 27.5%) being the most frequent in adults; respiratory diseases and asthma (4 -21.1%), haematological and oncological diseases (3 - 15.8%) being the most frequent in children. Complications occurred in 2679 (73.4%) episodes, mostly for respiratory diseases (2470 - 93.2% in adults, 16 - 55.2% in children), renal (681 - 25.7%) and cardiac (631 - 23.8%) complication for adults. The second and third most frequent complications in children affected the digestive system and the liver (7 - 24.1%). A targeted treatment was given in 1299 (35.6%) episodes, mostly with hydroxychloroquine (989 - 76.1%). Intensive care units stays were reported in 578 (15.8%) episodes. 527 (14.5%) deaths were registered, all among adults.

ConclusionThe surveillance system has been successfully initiated and provides a very representative set of data for Switzerland. We therefore consider it to be a valuable addition to the existing mandatory reporting, providing more precise information on the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical course of these cases.","Thiabaud, A.; Iten, A.; Balmelli, C.; Senn, L.; Troillet, N.; Widmer, A.; Flury, D.; Schreiber, P.

12844,"COVID-19 pandemic in Djibouti: epidemiology and the response strategy followed to contain the virus during the first two months, 17 March to 16 May 2020","BackgroundFirst cases of COVID-19 were reported from Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and it progressed rapidly. On 30 January, WHO declared the new disease as a PHEIC, then as a Pandemic on 11 March. By mid-March, the virus spread widely; Djibouti was not spared and was hit by the pandemic with the first case detected on 17 March. Djibouti worked with WHO and other partners to develop a preparedness and response plan, and implemented a series of intervention measures. MoH together with its civilian and military partners, closely followed WHO recommended strategy based on four pillars: testing, isolating, early case management, and contact tracing. From 17 March to 16 May, Djibouti performed the highest per capita tests in Africa and isolated, treated and traced the contacts of each positive case, which allowed for a rapid control of the epidemic.

MethodsCOVID-19 data included in this study was collected through MoH Djibouti during the period from 17 March to 16 May 2020.

ResultsA total of 1,401 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were included in the study with 4 related deaths (CFR: 0.3%) and an attack rate of 0.15%. Males represented (68.4%) of the cases, with the age group 31-45 years old (34.2%) as the most affected. Djibouti conducted 17,532 tests, and was considered as a champion for COVID-19 testing in Africa with 18.2 tests per 1000 habitant. All positive cases were isolated, treated and had their contacts traced, which led to early and proactive diagnosis of cases and in turn yielded up to 95-98% asymptomatic cases. Recoveries reached 69% of the infected cases with R0 (0.91). The virus was detected in 4 regions in the country, with the highest percentage in the capital (83%).

ConclusionDjibouti responded to COVID-19 pandemic following an efficient and effective strategy, using a strong collaboration between civilian and military health assets that increased the response capacities of the country. Partnership, coordination, solidarity, proactivity and commitment were the pillars to confront COVID-19 pandemic.","Elhakim, M.; Tourab, S.

17568,"The challenges of caring for people dying from COVID-19: a multinational,observational study of palliative and hospice services (CovPall)","BackgroundSystematic data on the care of people dying with COVID-19 are scarce. We studied the response of and challenges for palliative care services during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsWe surveyed palliative care and hospice services, contacted via relevant organisations. Multivariable logistic regression identified associations with key challenges. Content analysis explored free text.

Findings458 services responded; 277 UK, 85 rest of Europe, 95 rest of the world (1 country unreported); 81% cared for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, 77% had staff with suspected or confirmed COVID-19; 48% reported shortages of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), 40% staff shortages, 24% medicines shortages, 14% shortages of other equipment. Services provided direct care and education in symptom management and communication; 91% changed how they worked. Care often shifted to increased community and hospital care, with fewer admissions to inpatient palliative care units. Factors associated with increased odds of PPE shortages were: charity rather than public management (OR 3{middle dot}07, 95% CI 1{middle dot}81-5{middle dot}20), inpatient palliative care unit rather than other setting (OR 2{middle dot}34, 95% CI 1{middle dot}46-3{middle dot}75). Being outside the UK was associated with lower odds of staff shortages (OR 0{middle dot}44, 95% CI 0{middle dot}26-0{middle dot}76). Staff described increased workload, concerns for their colleagues who were ill, whilst expending time struggling to get essential equipment and medicines, perceiving they were not a front-line service.

InterpretationAcross all settings palliative care services were often overwhelmed, yet felt ignored in the COVID-19 response. Palliative care needs better integration with health care systems when planning and responding to future epidemics/pandemics.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSystematic data on the response of palliative care services during COVID-19 are lacking. A search of PubMed on 27 August 2020 (start date: 01 December 2019) using keywords (palliative care OR end of life care OR hospice) and (COVID-19 OR coronavirus) and (multinational OR international) identified no studies that reported multinational or international data; there were 79 articles, mostly opinion pieces, single centre case studies or reports. A search for systematic reviews about palliative care and hospice services during pandemics of PubMed, with the same time periods and the keywords (palliative care OR end of life care OR hospice) and (COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2) and (systematic review OR meta-analysis), identified one systematic review by Etkind et al, which underpinned this research and shares two senior authors (Higginson, Sleeman). Of 3094 articles identified, 10 studies, all observational, considered the palliative care response in pandemics. Studies were from single units or countries: West Africa, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, the U.S. (a simulation), and Italy (the only one considering COVID-19). The review concluded hospice and palliative care services are essential in the response to COVID-19 but systematic data are urgently needed to inform how to improve care for those who are likely to die, and/or have severe symptoms.

Added value of this studyWe found a high response by palliative care services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Services cared for a surge in patients dying from and with severe symptoms due to COVID-19 in three main categories: patients with underlying conditions and/or multimorbid disease not previously known to palliative care (70% of services), patients already known to palliative care services (47% of services), and patients, previously healthy, now dying from COVID-19 (37% of services). More than three quarters of services reported having staff with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. We found high levels of shortages of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), staff, medicines and other equipment, with different effects according to service management, care settings and world regions. Mitigating these challenges was extremely time consuming, limiting the palliative care response.

Implications of all the available evidenceDespite actively supporting dying patients, those with severe symptoms, their families/carers, and supporting other clinicians, palliative care professionals felt ignored by national health systems during the COVID-19 pandemic.

12499,"Rapid, sensitive and specific SARS coronavirus-2 detection: a multi-center comparison between standard qRT-PCR and CRISPR based DETECTR.","Recent advances in CRISPR-based diagnostics suggest that DETECTR, a combination of isothermal reverse transcriptase loop mediated amplification (RT-LAMP) and subsequent Cas12 bystander nuclease activation by amplicon targeting ribonucleoprotein complexes, could be a faster and cheaper alternative to qRT-PCR without sacrificing sensitivity/specificity. Here we compare qRT-PCR with DETECTR to diagnose COVID-19 on 378 patient samples and report a 95% reproducibility. Patient sample dilution assays suggest a higher analytical sensitivity of DETECTR compared to qRT-PCR, however, this was not confirmed in a large patient cohort. The data showed that both techniques are equally sensitive in detecting SARS-CoV-2 providing an added value of DETECTR to the currently used qRT-PCR platforms. For DETECTR, different gRNAs can be used simultaneously to obviate negative results due to mutations in N-gene. Lateral flow strips, suitable as a point of care test (POCT), showed a 100% correlation to the high-throughput DETECTR assay. Importantly, DETECTR was 100% specific for SARS-CoV-2 and did not detect other human coronaviruses. As there is no need for specialized equipment, DETECTR could be rapidly implemented as a complementary technically independent approach to qRT-PCR thereby increasing the testing capacity of medical microbiological laboratories and relieving the existent PCR-platforms for routine non-SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing.","Brandsma, E.; Verhagen, H.

A national convenience sample of volunteers aged 18 or older was assessed between 13th April and 2nd June 2020. Flu vaccine rates were calculated for all classes of age. The association between the independent variables and the flu vaccine was assessed by applying a multivariable binary logistic regression model. Of the 198,822 respondents 41,818 (21.0%) reported to have received a flu vaccination shot during the last influenza season. In particular, 15,009 (53.4%) subjects aged 65 years or older received a flu vaccination shot.

20912,Modeling the impact of racial and ethnic disparities on COVID-19 epidemic dynamics,"The impact of variable infection risk by race and ethnicity on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread is largely unknown. Here, we fit structured compartmental models to seroprevalence data from New York State and analyze how herd immunity thresholds (HITs), final sizes, and epidemic risk changes across groups. A simple model where interactions occur proportionally to contact rates reduced the HIT, but more realistic models of preferential mixing within groups increased the threshold toward the value observed in homogeneous populations. Across all models, the burden of infection fell disproportionately on minority populations: in a model fit to Long Island serosurvey and census data, 81% of Hispanics or Latinos were infected when the HIT was reached compared to 34% of non-Hispanic whites. Our findings, which are meant to be illustrative and not best estimates, demonstrate how racial and ethnic disparities can impact epidemic trajectories and result in unequal distributions of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ma, K.

20071,The first wave of the Spanish COVID-19 epidemic was associated with early introductions and fast spread of a dominating genetic variant,"The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the world since the beginning of 2020. Spain is among the European countries with the highest incidence of the disease during the first pandemic wave. We established a multidisciplinar consortium to monitor and study the evolution of the epidemic, with the aim of contributing to decision making and stopping rapid spreading across the country. We present the results for 2170 sequences from the first wave of the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic in Spain and representing 12% of diagnosed cases until 14th March. This effort allows us to document at least 500 initial introductions, between early February-March from multiple international sources. Importantly, we document the early raise of two dominant genetic variants in Spain (Spanish Epidemic Clades), named SEC7 and SEC8, likely amplified by superspreading events. In sharp contrast to other non-Asian countries those two variants were closely related to the initial variants of SARS-CoV-2 described in Asia and represented 40% of the genome sequences analyzed. The two dominant SECs were widely spread across the country compared to other genetic variants with SEC8 reaching a 60% prevalence just before the lockdown. Employing Bayesian phylodynamic analysis, we inferred a reduction in the effective reproductive number of these two SECs from around 2.5 to below 0.5 after the implementation of strict public-health interventions in mid March. The effects of lockdown on the genetic variants of the virus are reflected in the general replacement of preexisting SECs by a new variant at the beginning of the summer season. Our results reveal a significant difference in the genetic makeup of the epidemic in Spain and support the effectiveness of lockdown measures in controlling virus spread even for the most successful genetic variants. Finally, earlier control of SEC7 and particularly SEC8 might have reduced the incidence and impact of COVID-19 in our country.","Lopez, M.

9822,Covid-19 in Chile. The experience of a Regional reference Center. Preliminary report,"During the first pandemic wave Covid-19 reached Latin America cities.

AimTo report clinical features and outcomes associated to Covid-19 in a group of patients admitted during the first wave in a regional reference Center in southern Chile designated to severe and critical cases.

MethodsCases were identified by a compatible clinical picture associated to positive RT-PCR or serological testing. A standard protocol was applied.

Results21 adult patients (20 diagnosed by PCR, one by serology) were admitted between epidemiological weeks 13 to 20, involving 8.8% of total regional cases. Hospitalization occurred at a median of 11 days after symptoms onset. Patients [&ge;]60 years old predominated (57.1%). Hypertension (61.9%), obesity (57.1%) and diabetes mellitus 2 (38.1%) were prevalent but 19% had no comorbid conditions nor were elderly. Two cases involved second-trimester pregnant women. Positive IgM or IgM/IgG results obtained by rapid serological testing were limited (19% at 1st week; 42.9% at 2nd week). Nine patients (42.9%, critical group) were transferred to ICU and connected to mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. By univariate analysis admission to ICU was significantly associated to tachypnea and higher plasmatic LDH values. One pregnant woman required urgent cesarean section given birth to a premature neonate without vertical transmission. Two patients died (in-hospital mortality 9.5%) and length of stay was [&ge;] 14 days in 57.9% of patients.

ConclusionIn our regional Center, Covid 19 was associated to known risk factors, had a prolonged stay and in-hospital mortality.

12892,Waves of COVID-19 pandemic. Detection and SIR simulations,"BackgroundUnfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic is still far from stabilizing. Of particular concern is the sharp increase in the number of diseases in June-July 2020. The causes and consequences of this sharp increase in the number of cases are still waiting for their researchers, but there is already an urgent need to assess the possible duration of the pandemic, the expected number of patients and deaths. The resumption of international passenger traffic needs the information for deciding which countries citizens are welcome guests. Correct simulation of the infectious disease dynamics needs complicated mathematical models and many efforts for unknown parameters identification. Constant changes in the pandemic conditions (in particular, the peculiarities of quarantine and its violation, situations with testing and isolation of patients) cause various epidemic waves, lead to changes in the parameter values of the mathematical models.

ObjectiveIn this article, pandemic waves in Ukraine and in the world will be detected, calculated and discussed. The estimations for hidden periods, epidemic durations and final numbers of cases will be presented. The probabilities of meeting a person spreading the infection and reproduction numbers will be calculated for different countries and regions.

MethodsWe propose a simple method for the epidemic waves detection based on the differentiation of the smoothed number of cases. We use the known SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model for the dynamics of the epidemic waves. The known exact solution of the SIR differential equations and statistical approach were modified and used.

ResultsThe optimal values of the SIR model parameters were identified for four waves of pandemic dynamics in Ukraine and five waves in the world. The number of cases and the number of patients spreading the infection versus time were calculated. In particular, the pandemic probably began in August 2019. If current trends continue, the end of the pandemic should be expected no earlier than in March 2021 both in Ukraine and in the world, the global number of cases will exceed 20 million. The probabilities of meeting a person spreading the infection and reproduction numbers were calculated for different countries and regions.

ConclusionsThe SIR model and statistical approach to the parameter identification are helpful to make some reliable estimations of the epidemic waves. The number of persons spreading the infection versus time was calculated during all the epidemic waves. The obtained information will be useful to regulate the quarantine activities, to predict the medical and economic consequences of the pandemic and to decide which countries citizens are welcome guests.","Nesteruk, I.",2020-08-04,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.03.20167098,1,Igor Nesteruk,Institute of Hydromechanics National Academy of sciences of Ukraine,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.03.20167098v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.03.20167098v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
5632,Estimating COVID-19 Prevalence in the United States: A Sample Selection Model Approach,"BackgroundPublic health efforts to determine population infection rates from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been hampered by limitations in testing capabilities and the large shares of mild and asymptomatic cases. We developed a methodology that corrects observed positive test rates for non-random sampling to estimate population infection rates across U.S. states from March 31 to April 7.

MethodsWe adapted a sample selection model that corrects for non-random testing to estimate population infection rates. The methodology compares how the observed positive case rate vary with changes in the size of the tested population, and applies this gradient to infer total population infection rates. Model identification requires that variation in testing rates be uncorrelated with changes in underlying disease prevalence. To this end, we relied on data on day-to-day changes in completed tests across U.S. states for the period March 31 to April 7, which were primarily influenced by immediate supply-side constraints. We used this methodology to construct predicted infection rates across each state over the sample period. We also assessed the sensitivity of the results to controls for state-specific daily trends in infection rates.

ResultsThe median population infection rate over the period March 31 to April 7 was 0.9% (IQR 0.64 1.77). The three states with the highest prevalence over the sample period were New York (8.5%), New Jersey (7.6%), and Louisiana (6.7%). Estimates from mod-els that control for state-specific daily trends in infection rates were virtually identical to the baseline findings. The estimates imply a nationwide average of 12 population infections per diagnosed case. We found a negative bivariate relationship (corr. = -0.51) between total per capita state testing and the ratio of population infections per diagnosed case.

InterpretationThe effectiveness of the public health response to the coronavirus pandemic will depend on timely information on infection rates across different regions. With increasingly available high frequency data on COVID-19 testing, our methodology could be used to estimate population infection rates for a range of countries and subnational districts. In the United States, we found widespread undiagnosed COVID-19 infection. Expansion of rapid diagnostic and serological testing will be critical in preventing recurrent unobserved community transmission and identifying the large numbers individuals who may have some level of viral immunity.

DesignCross-sectional observational study.

SettingUK-based primary and secondary care.

ParticipantsHCWs aged [&ge;]18 years working between 1 February and 25 May 2020.

Main outcome measuresA composite endpoint of laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, or self-isolation or hospitalisation due to suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

ResultsOf 6152 eligible responses, the composite endpoint was present in 1806 (29.4%) HCWs, of whom 49 (0.8%) were hospitalised, 459 (7.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 1776 (28.9%) reported self-isolation. The strongest risk factor associated with the presence of the primary composite endpoint was increasing frequency of contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases without adequate personal protective equipment (PPE): """"Never"""" (reference), """"Rarely"""" (adjusted odds ratio 1.06, (95% confidence interval: 0.87 to 1.29)), """"Sometimes"""" (1.7 (1.37 to 2.10)), """"Often"""" (1.84 (1.28 to 2.63)), """"Always"""" (2.93, (1.75 to 5.06)). Additionally, several comorbidities (cancer, respiratory disease, and obesity); working in a  doctors role; using public transportation for work; regular contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients; and lack of PPE were also associated with the presence of the primary endpoint. 1382 (22.5%) HCWs reported lacking access to PPE items while having clinical contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases. Overall, between 11,870 and 21,158 days of self-isolation were required by the cohort, equalling approximately 71 to 127 working days lost per 1000 working days.

ConclusionsSuspected or confirmed COVID-19 was more common in HCWs than in the general population. Risk factors included inadequate PPE, which was reported by nearly a quarter of HCWs. Governments and policymakers must ensure adequate PPE is available as well as developing strategies to mitigate risk for high-risk HCWs during future COVID-19 waves.","Kua, J.; Patel, R.; Nurmi, E.; Tian, S.; Gill, H.; Moorley, C.; Wong, D.

2333,The effect of human mobility and control measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in China,"The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has expanded rapidly throughout China. Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China have substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.","Kraemer, M. U.

18715,"Mobile outreach testing for COVID-19 in twenty homeless shelters in Toronto, Canada","BackgroundIt is unclear what the best strategy is for detecting COVID-19 among homeless shelter residents and what individual factors are associated with positivity.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective chart audit obtaining repeated cross-sectional data from outreach testing done at homeless shelters between April 1st and July 31st, 2020 in Toronto, Canada. We compared the positivity rate for shelters tested because of an outbreak (at least one known case) versus surveillance (no known cases). A patient-level analysis examined differences in demographic, health, and behavioural characteristics of residents who did and did not test positive for COVID-19.

FindingsOne thousand nasopharyngeal swabs were done on 872 unique residents at 20 shelter locations. Among the 504 tests done in outbreak settings, 69 (14%) were positive and 1 (0.2%) was indeterminate. Among the 496 tests done for surveillance, 11 (2%) were positive and none were indeterminate. Shelter residents who tested positive were significantly less likely to have a health insurance card (54% vs 72%, p=0.03) or have visited another shelter in the last 14 days (0% vs 18%, p<0.01) compared to those who tested negative; There was no association between COVID-19 positivity and medical history (p=0.40) or symptoms (p=0.43).

InterpretationOur findings support testing of asymptomatic shelter residents for COVID-19 when a positive case is identified at the same shelter but suggest limited utility of testing all shelter residents in the absence of a known case. Visiting another shelter in the last 14 days is associated with a decreased risk of COVID-19 positivity.","Kiran, T.; Craig-Neil, A.; Das, P.; Lockwood, J.; Wang, R.; Nathanielsz, N.; Rosenthal, E.; Snider, C.; Hwang, S.",2020-11-24,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.11.23.20235465,1,Tara Kiran,St. Michael\'s Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.23.20235465v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.23.20235465v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
15149,The impact of COVID-19 in diabetic kidney disease and chronic kidney disease: A population-based study,"BackgroundThe spectrum of pre-existing renal disease is known as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes. However, little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on patients with diabetic nephropathy in comparison to patients with chronic kidney disease.

MethodsWe used the Mexican Open Registry of COVID-19 patients 11 to analyze anonymized records of those who had symptoms related to COVID-19 to analyze the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 pneumonia, admission, intubation, Intensive Care Unit admission and mortality. Robust Poisson regression was used to relate sex and age to each of the six outcomes and find adjusted prevalences and adjusted prevalence ratios. Also, binomial regression models were performed for those outcomes that had significant results to generate probability plots to perform a fine analysis of the results obtained along age as a continuous variable.

ResultsThe adjusted prevalence analysis revealed that that there was a a 87.9% excess probability of developing COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with diabetic nephropathy, a 5% excess probability of being admitted, a 101.7% excess probability of intubation and a 20.8% excess probability of a fatal outcome due to COVID-19 pneumonia in comparison to CKD patients (p< 0.01).

ConclusionsPatients with diabetic nephropathy had nearly a twofold rate of COVID-19 pneumonia, a higher probability of admission, a twofold probability of intubation and a higher chance of death once admitted compared to patients with chronic kidney disease alone. Also, both diseases had higher COVID-19 pneumonia rates, intubation rates and case-fatality rates compared to the overall population.","Leon-Abarca, J. A.; Memon, R.

21618,The mobility gap: estimating mobility levels required to control Canada's winter COVID-19 surge,"BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions remain a primary means of suppressing COVID-19 until vaccination coverage is sufficient to achieve herd immunity. We used anonymized smartphone mobility measures in seven Canadian provinces to quantify the mobility level needed to suppress COVID-19 (mobility threshold), and the difference relative to current mobility levels (mobility gap).

MethodsWe conducted a longitudinal study of weekly COVID-19 incidence from March 15, 2020 to January 16, 2021, among provinces with 20 COVID-19 cases in at least 10 weeks. The outcome was weekly growth rate defined as the ratio of current cases compared to the previous week. We examined the effects of average time spent outside the home (non-residential mobility) in the prior three weeks using a lognormal regression model accounting for province, season, and mean temperature. We calculated the COVID-19 mobility threshold and gap.

ResultsAcross the 44-week study period, a total of 704,294 persons were infected with COVID-19. Non-residential mobility dropped rapidly in the spring and reached a median of 36% (IQR: 31,40) in April 2020. After adjustment, each 5% increase in non-residential mobility was associated with a 9% increase in the COVID-19 weekly growth rate (ratio=1.09, 95%CI: 1.07,1.12). The mobility gap increased through the fall months, which was associated with increasing case growth.

InterpretationMobility strongly and consistently predicts weekly case growth, and low levels of mobility are needed to control COVID-19 through winter 2021. Mobility measures from anonymized smartphone data can be used to guide the provincial and regional implementation and loosening of physical distancing measures.","Brown, K. A.; Soucy, J.-P.

24033,Development of a COVID-19 Application Ontology for the ACT Network,"Clinical data networks that leverage large volumes of data in electronic health records (EHRs) are significant resources for research on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Data harmonization is a key challenge in seamless use of multisite EHRs for COVID-19 research. We developed a COVID-19 application ontology in the national Accrual to Clinical Trials (ACT) network that enables harmonization of data elements that that are critical to COVID-19 research. The ontology contains over 50,000 concepts in the domains of diagnosis, procedures, medications, and laboratory tests. In particular, it has computational phenotypes to characterize the course of illness and outcomes, derived terms, and harmonized value sets for SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests. The ontology was deployed and validated on the ACT COVID-19 network that consists of nine academic health centers with data on 14.5M patients. This ontology, which is freely available to the entire research community on GitHub at https://github.com/shyamvis/ACT-COVID-Ontology, will be useful for harmonizing EHRs for COVID-19 research beyond the ACT network.","Visweswaran, S.; Samayamuthu, M.

12550,Eleven Routine Clinical Features Predict COVID-19 Severity,"Severity prediction of COVID-19 remains one of the major clinical challenges for the ongoing pandemic. Here, we have recruited a 144 COVID-19 patient cohort consisting of training, validation, and internal test sets, longitudinally recorded 124 routine clinical and laboratory parameters, and built a machine learning model to predict the disease progression based on measurements from the first 12 days since the disease onset when no patient became severe. A panel of 11 routine clinical factors, including oxygenation index, basophil counts, aspartate aminotransferase, gender, magnesium, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, platelet counts, activated partial thromboplastin time, oxygen saturation, body temperature and days after symptom onset, constructed a classifier for COVID-19 severity prediction, achieving accuracy of over 94%. Validation of the model in an independent cohort containing 25 patients achieved accuracy of 80%. The overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 0.70, 0.99, 0.93 and 0.93, respectively.

11859,Identifying organ dysfunction trajectory-based subphenotypes in critically ill patients with COVID-19,"RationaleCOVID-19-associated respiratory failure offers the unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the differential host response to a uniform pathogenic insult. Prior studies of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) have identified subphenotypes with differential outcomes. Understanding whether there are distinct subphenotypes of severe COVID-19 may offer insight into its pathophysiology.

ObjectivesTo identify and characterize distinct subphenotypes of COVID-19 critical illness defined by the post-intubation trajectory of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.

MethodsIntubated COVID-19 patients at two hospitals in New York city were leveraged as development and validation cohorts. Patients were grouped into mild, intermediate, and severe strata by their baseline post-intubation SOFA. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering was performed within each stratum to detect subphenotypes based on similarities amongst SOFA score trajectories evaluated by Dynamic Time Warping. Statistical tests defined trajectory subphenotype predictive markers.

Measurements and Main ResultsDistinct worsening and recovering subphenotypes were identified within each stratum, which had distinct 7-day post-intubation SOFA progression trends. Patients in the worsening suphenotypes had a higher mortality than those in the recovering subphenotypes within each stratum (mild stratum, 29.7% vs. 10.3%, p=0.033; intermediate stratum, 29.3% vs. 8.0%, p=0.002; severe stratum, 53.7% vs. 22.2%, p<0.001). Worsening and recovering subphenotypes were replicated in the validation cohort. Routine laboratory tests, vital signs, and respiratory variables rather than demographics and comorbidities were predictive of the worsening and recovering subphenotypes.

ConclusionsThere are clear worsening and recovering subphenotypes of COVID-19 respiratory failure after intubation, which are more predictive of outcomes than baseline severity of illness. Organ dysfunction trajectory may be well suited as a surrogate for research in COVID-19 respiratory failure.

At a Glance CommentaryO_ST_ABSScientific Knowledge on the SubjectC_ST_ABSCOVID-19 associated respiratory failure leads to a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. It is clear that there is heterogeneity in the viral-induced host response leading to differential outcomes, even amongst those treated with mechanical ventilation. There are many studies of COVID-19 disease which use intubation status as an outcome or an inclusion criterion. However, there is less understanding of the post intubation course in COVID-19.

What This Study Adds to the FieldWe have developed and validated a novel subphenotyping model based on post-intubation organ dysfunction trajectory in COVID-19 patients. Specifically, we identified clear worsening and recovering organ dysfunction trajectory subphenotypes, which are more predictive of outcomes than illness severity at baseline. Dynamic inflammatory markers and ventilator variables rather than baseline severity of illness, demographics and comorbidities differentiate the worsening and recovering subphenotypes. Trajectory subphenotypes offer a potential road map for understanding the evolution of critical illness in COVID-19.","Su, C.; Xu, Z.; Hoffman, K.; Goyal, P.; Safford, M.

18595,Antibody persistency and trend post-SARS-CoV-2 infection at eight months,"An improved understanding of the immunity offered by the antibodies developed against SARS-CoV-2 is critical for the development of diagnostic tests and vaccines. Our study aimed at the longitudinal analysis of antibody presence, persistence and its trend over a period of eight months in a group of COVID-19 recovered patients who tested positive by real-time quantitative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in the period between the 18th and 30th of March, 2020. The subjects were divided into two groups based on disease severity: mild and moderately-severe. The MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV lgM/lgG chemiluminescent analytical system (CLIA) assay was used to analyse the antibody titres. Robust IgG antibody persistency was demonstrated in 76.7 % of the subjects (23 out of 30) at eight months post-infection. The results of this study highlight an important point in terms of the association between humoral immune response and disease severity. Patients who might have experienced a relatively moderate-severe infection may develop a robust immunity that could persist for a longer duration.","Dehgani-Mobaraki, P.; Kamber Zaidi, A.; Porreca, A.; Floridi, A.; Floridi, E.",2020-11-29,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.11.21.20236117,2,Puya Dehgani-Mobaraki,"Associazione Naso Sano, Italy",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.21.20236117v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.21.20236117v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA

4543,Importance of untested infectious individuals for the suppression of COVID-19 epidemics,"The impact of the extent of testing infectious individuals on suppression of COVID-19 is illustrated from the early stages of outbreaks in Germany, the Hubei province of China, Italy, Spain and the UK. The predicted percentage of untested infected individuals depends on the specific outbreak but we found that they typically represent 50% to 80% of the infected individuals. Even when unreported cases are taken into account, we estimate that less than 8% of the population would have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by 09/04/2020 in the analysed outbreaks. These levels are far below the 70-85% needed to ensure herd immunity and would predict a resurgence of infection if ongoing lockdowns in the outbreaks are fully lifted. We propose that partially lifted lockdowns together with early and thorough testing allowing for quick isolation of both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases could lead to suppression of secondary waves of COVID-19 epidemics.","Perez-Reche, F.

14579,Decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA viruses from N95 level meltblown polypropylene fabric using heat under different humidities,"In March of 2020, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The pandemic led to a shortage of N95-grade filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), especially for protection of healthcare professionals against airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We and others have previously reported promising decontamination methods that may be applied to the recycling and reuse of FFRs. In this study we tested disinfection of three viruses including SARS-CoV-2, dried on a piece of meltblown fabric, the principal component responsible for filtering of fine particles in N95-level FFRs, under a range of temperatures (60-95{degrees}C) at ambient or 100% relative humidity (RH) in conjunction with filtration efficiency testing. We found that heat treatments of 75{degrees}C for 30 min or 85{degrees}C for 20 min at 100% RH resulted in efficient decontamination from the fabric of SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), and another enveloped RNA virus, chikungunya virus vaccine strain 181 (CHIKV-181), without lowering the meltblown fabrics filtration efficiency.","Campos, R.

14259,Beneficial Effect of Corticosteroids in Preventing Mortality in Patients Receiving Tocilizumab to Treat Severe COVID-19 Illness,"IntroductionOn the basis of the preliminary report from the RECOVERY trial, the use of dexamethasone or alternative corticosteroids (CS) is currently recommended in severe COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen. However, last updated recommendations have not taken a position either for or against the use of other immunomodulators such as tocilizumab (TCZ), with or without CS, since results are still limited.

MethodsFrom March 17 to April 7, 2020, a real-world observational retrospective analysis was conducted at our 750-bed university hospital to study the characteristics and risk factors for mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 treated with TCZ +/-CS, in addition to standard of care (SOC). Data were obtained from routine clinical practice, stored in electronic medical records. The main outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality.

ResultsA total of 1,092 COVID-19 patients were admitted during the study period. Of them, 186 (17%) were treated with TCZ, of which 129 (87.8%) in combination with CS. Of the total 186, 155 (83.3 %) patients were receiving non-invasive ventilation when TCZ +/-CS was initiated. Mean time from symptoms onset and hospital admission to TCZ use was 12 ({+/-} 4.3) and 4.3 days ({+/-} 3.4), respectively. Overall, 147 (79%) survived and 39 (21%) died. By multivariate analysis, mortality was associated with older age (HR=1.09, p<0.001), chronic heart failure (HR=4.4, p=0.003), and chronic liver disease (HR=4.69, p=0.004). The use of CS, in combination with TCZ, was the main protective factor against mortality (HR=0.26, p<0.001) in such severe COVID-19 patients receiving TCZ. No serious superinfections were observed after a 30-day follow-up.

ConclusionsIn severe COVID-19 patients receiving TCZ due to systemic host-immune inflammatory response syndrome, the use of CS in addition to TCZ therapy, showed beneficial effect in preventing in-hospital mortality.","Rubio-Rivas, M.; Ronda, M.; Padulles, A.; Mitjavila, F.; Riera-Mestre, A.; Garcia-Forero, C.; Iriarte, A.; Mora, J.

10972,Assessing the burden of COVID-19 amongst healthcare workers in Mexico City: A data-driven call to action,"BACKGROUNDHealth-care workers (HCWs) have increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Information about the prevalence and risk factors for adverse outcomes in HCWs is scarce in Mexico. Here, we aimed to explore prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, symptoms, and risk factors associated with adverse outcomes in HCWs in Mexico City.

METHODSWe explored data collected by the National Epidemiological Surveillance System in Mexico City. All cases underwent real-time RT-PCR test. We explored outcomes related to severe COVID-19 in HCWs and the diagnostic performance of symptoms to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs.

RESULTSAs of July 2nd, 2020, 34,263 HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 10,925 were confirmed (31.9%). Overall, 4,200 were nurses (38.4%), 3,244 physicians (29.7%), 126 dentists (1.15%) and 3,355 laboratory personnel and other HCWs (30.7%). After follow-up, 992 HCWs required hospitalization (9.08%), 206 developed severe outcomes (1.89%), and 90 required mechanical-ventilatory support (0.82%). Lethality was recorded in 224 (2.05%) cases. Symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were fever, cough, malaise, shivering, myalgias at evaluation but neither had significant predictive value. We also identified 333 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections (3.05%). Older HCWs with chronic non-communicable diseases, pregnancy, and severe respiratory symptoms were associated with higher risk for adverse outcomes. Physicians had higher risk for hospitalization and for severe outcome compared with nurses and other HCWs.

CONCLUSIONSWe report a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs in Mexico City. No symptomatology can accurately discern HCWs with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Particular attention should focus on HCWs with risk factors to prevent adverse outcomes and reduce infection risk.","Antonio-Villa, N. E.; Bello-Chavolla, O.

24276,Individual social contact data reflected SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics during the first wave in Germany better than population mobility data - an analysis based on the COVIMOD study,"BackgroundThe effect of contact reduction measures on infectious disease transmission can only be assessed indirectly and with considerable delay. However, individual social contact data and population mobility data can offer near real-time proxy information.

AimTo compare social contact data and population mobility data with respect to their ability to predict transmission dynamics during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Germany.

MethodsWe quantified the change in social contact patterns derived from self-reported contact survey data collected by the German COVIMOD study from 04/2020-06/2020 (compared to the pre-pandemic period), and estimated the percentage mean reduction in the effective reproduction number R(t) over time. We compared these results to the ones based on R(t) estimates from open-source mobility data and to R(t) values provided by the German Public Health Institute.

ResultsWe observed the largest reduction in social contacts (90%, compared to pre-pandemic data) in late April corresponding to the strictest contacts reduction measures. Thereafter, the reduction in contacts dropped continuously to a minimum of 73% in late June. R(t) estimates based on social contacts underestimated measured R(t) values slightly in the time of strictest contact reduction measures but predicted R(t) well thereafter. R(t) estimates based on mobility data overestimated R(t) considerably throughout the study.

ConclusionsR(t) prediction accuracy based on contact survey data was superior to the one based on population mobility data, indicating that measuring changes in mobility alone is not sufficient for understanding changes in transmission dynamics triggered by public health measures.","Tomori, D.

7209,Transmission of aerosols through pristine and reprocessed N95 respirators,"During the Covid-19 pandemic, pristine and reprocessed N95 respirators are crucial equipment towards limiting nosocomial infections. The NIOSH test certifying the N95 rating, however, poorly simulates aerosols in healthcare settings, limiting our understanding of the exposure risk for healthcare workers wearing these masks, especially reprocessed ones. We used experimental conditions that simulated the sizes, densities and airflow properties of infectious aerosols in healthcare settings. We analyzed the penetration and leakage of aerosols through pristine and reprocessed N95 respirators. Seven reprocessing methods were investigated.

12614,Incidence and outcomes of healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections: significance of delayed diagnosis and correlation with staff absence,"BackgroundThe sudden increase in COVID-19 admissions in hospitals during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic of 2020 has led to onward transmissions among vulnerable inpatients.

AimsThis study was performed to evaluate the prevalence and clinical outcomes of Healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections (HA-COVID-19) during the 2020 epidemic and study factors which may promote or correlate with its incidence and transmission in a London Teaching Hospital Trust.

MethodsElectronic laboratory, patient and staff self-reported sickness records were interrogated for the period 1st March to 18th April 2020. HA-COVID-19 was defined as symptom onset >14d of admission. Test performance of a single combined throat and nose swab (CTNS) for patient placement and the effect of delayed RNA positivity (DRP, defined as >48h delay) on patient outcomes was evaluated. The incidence of staff self-reported COVID-19 sickness absence, hospital bed occupancy, community incidence and DRP was compared HA-COVID-19. The incidence of other significant hospital-acquired bacterial infections (OHAI) was compared to previous years.

Results58 HA-COVID-19 (7.1%) cases were identified. As compared to community-acquired cases, significant differences were observed in age (p=0.018), ethnicity (p<0.001) and comorbidity burden (p<0.001) but not in 30d mortality. CTNS negative predictive value was 60.3%. DRP was associated with greater mortality (p=0.034) and 34.5% HA-COVID-19 cases could be traced to delayed diagnosis in CA-COVID-19. Incidence of HA-COVID-19 correlated positively with DRP (R=0.7108) and staff sickness absence (R=0.7815). OHAI rates were similar to previous 2 years.

ConclusionEarly diagnosis and isolation of COVID-19 would help reduce transmission. A single CTNS has limited value in segregating patients into positive and negative pathways.","Khonyongwa, K.; Taori, S. K.; Soares, A.; Desai, N.; Sudhanva, M.; Bernal, W.; Schelenz, S.; Curran, L.

8964,"County-Level Proportions of Black and Hispanic populations, and Socioeconomic Characteristics in Association with Confirmed COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in the United States","ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to investigate potential county-level disparities among racial/ethnic and economic groups in COVID-19 burden which was measured using confirmed cases and deaths in 100,000 population.

DesignSecondary data analysis using county-level data for 3,142 US counties was conducted in 2020. Hierarchical linear regression and concentration curve analyses were performed. The association of COVID-19 cases and deaths was examined separately by sociodemographic and economic characteristics of the county population. American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates (2014-2018), Area Health Resources File (AHRF) 2018-2019, and 2020 COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins University were used in this study.

ResultsAfter adjusting for covariates, US counties with a higher proportion of black population, and a higher proportion of adults with less than high school diploma had disproportionately higher COVID-19 cases and deaths ({beta}>0, p<0.05). A higher proportion of the Hispanic population was associated with higher confirmed cases ({beta}= 1.03, 95% CI= 0.57-1.5), and higher housing cost to household income ratio was associated with higher deaths ({beta}= 3.74, 95% CI= 2.14-5.37). This observed disparities can potentially aggravate the existing health disparities among these population groups.

ConclusionsIdentification of disproportionately impacted population groups can pave the way towards narrowing the disparity gaps and guide policymakers and stakeholders in designing and implementing population group-specific interventions to mitigate the negative consequences of COVID-19 pandemic.","Khanijahani, A.",2020-06-05,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.06.03.20120667,1,Ahmad Khanijahani,Duquesne University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.20120667v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.20120667v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1080/13557858.2020.1853067
20780,Lessons learnt from the use of compartmental models over the COVID-19 induced lockdown in France,"BackgroundCompartmental models help making public health decisions. They were used during the COVID-19 outbreak to estimate the reproduction numbers and predict the number of hospital beds required. This study examined the ability of closely related compartmental models to reflect equivalent epidemic dynamics.

MethodsThe study considered three independently designed compartmental models that described the COVID-19 outbreak in France. Model compartments and parameters were expressed in a common framework and models were calibrated using the same hospitalization data from two official public databases. The calibration procedure was repeated over three different periods to compare model abilities to: i) fit over the whole lockdown; ii) predict the course of the epidemic during the lockdown; and, iii) provide profiles to predict hospitalization prevalence after lockdown. The study considered national and regional coverages.

ResultsThe three models were all flexible enough to match real hospitalization data during the lockdown, but the numbers of cases in the other compartments differed. The three models failed to predict reliably the number of hospitalizations after the fitting periods at national as at regional scales. At the national scale, an improved calibration led to epidemic course profiles that reflected hospitalization dynamics and reproduction numbers that were coherent with official and literature estimates.

ConclusionThis study shows that prevalence data are needed to further refine the calibration and make a selection between still divergent models. This underlines strongly the need for repeated prevalence studies on representative population samples.","Gauchon, R.; Ponthus, N.; Pothier, C.; Rigotti, C.; Volpert, V.; Derrode, S.; Bertoglio, J.-P.; Bienvenue, A.; Goffard, P.-O.; Eyraud-Loisel, A.; Pageaud, S.; Iwaz, J.; Loisel, S.; Roy, P.",2021-03-01,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.01.11.21249565,3,Romain Gauchon,Lyon 1 university,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.11.21249565v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.11.21249565v3.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

22819,Prophylaxis for covid-19: living systematic review and network meta-analysis,"ObjectiveTo determine and compare the effects of drug prophylaxis on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19).

DesignLiving systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Data sourcesWHO covid-19 database, a comprehensive multilingual source of global covid-19 literature to 19 January 2021, and six additional Chinese databases to 20 January 2021.

Study selectionRandomized trials in which people at risk of covid-19 were randomized to drug prophylaxis or no prophylaxis (standard care or placebo). Pairs of reviewers independently screened potentially eligible articles.

MethodsAfter duplicate data abstraction, we conducted random-effects bayesian network meta-analysis. We assessed risk of bias of the included studies using a modification of the Cochrane risk of bias 2.0 tool and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) approach.

ResultsThe first iteration of this living network meta-analysis includes nine randomized trials - six addressing hydroxychloroquine (6,059 participants), one addressing ivermectin combined with iota-carrageenan (234 participants) and two addressing ivermectin alone (540 participants), all compared to standard care or placebo. Hydroxychloroquine has no important effect on admission to hospital (risk difference (RD) 1 fewer per 1,000, 95% credible interval (CrI) 3 fewer to 4 more, high certainty) or mortality (RD 1 fewer per 1,000, 95% CrI 2 fewer to 3 more, high certainty). Hydroxychloroquine probably has no important effect on laboratory-confirmed infection (RD 2 more per 1,000, 95% CrI 18 fewer to 28 more, moderate certainty), probably increases adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation (RD 19 more per 1,000, 95% CrI 1 fewer to 70 more, moderate certainty) and may have no important effect on suspected, probable or laboratory-confirmed infection (RD 15 fewer per 1,000, 95% CrI 64 fewer to 41 more, low certainty). Due to serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision - and thus very low certainty evidence, the effects of ivermectin combined with iota-carrageenan on laboratory-confirmed infection (RD 52 fewer per 1,000, 95% CrI 58 fewer to 37 fewer), and ivermectin alone on laboratory-confirmed infection (RD 50 fewer per 1,000, 95% CrI 59 fewer to 16 fewer) and suspected, probable or laboratory-confirmed infection (RD 159 fewer per 1,000, 95% CrI 165 fewer to 144 fewer) remain uncertain.

ConclusionHydroxychloroquine prophylaxis does not have an important effect on hospital admission and mortality, probably increases adverse effects, and probably does not have an important effect on laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because of serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision, we are highly uncertain whether ivermectin combined with iota-carrageenan and ivermectin alone reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

20674,"Efficacy of propolis as an adjunct treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients: a randomized, controlled clinical trial","Among candidate treatment options for COVID-19, propolis, produced by honey bees from bioactive plant exudates, has shown potential against viral targets and has demonstrated immunoregulatory properties. We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label, single center trial, with a standardized propolis product (EPP-AF) on hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients. Patients received standard care plus propolis at an oral dose of 400mg/day (n=40) or 800mg/day (n=42) for seven days, or standard care alone (n=42). Standard care included all necessary interventions, as determined by the attending physician. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement defined as the length of hospital stay or oxygen therapy dependency. Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury and need for intensive care or vasoactive drugs. Time in the hospital after intervention was significantly shortened in both propolis groups compared to the controls; median 7 days with 400mg/day and 6 days with 800mg/day, versus 12 days for standard care alone. Propolis did not significantly affect the need for oxygen supplementation. With the higher dose, significantly fewer patients developed acute kidney injury than in the controls (2 versus 10 of 42 patients). Propolis as an adjunct treatment was safe and reduced hospitalization time. The registration number for this clinical trial is: NCT04480593 (20/07/2020).","Silveira, M. A. D.; De Jong, D.; Galvao, E.

4528,Automated and semi-automated contact tracing: Protocol for a rapid review of available evidence and current challenges to inform the control of COVID-19,"IntroductionTraditional approaches to case-finding, case isolation, and contact tracing methods have so far proved insufficient on their own to prevent the development of local epidemics of COVID-19 in many high-income countries despite relatively advanced public health systems. As a result, many governments have resorted to widespread social distancing measures and mass quarantines ( lock-downs) to reduce transmission and to prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. However, such measures impose heavy human and societal costs. Automated or semi-automated digital contact tracing, in conjunction with scaled-up community testing, has been proposed as a key part of exit strategies from lockdowns. However, the effectiveness of these approaches to contact tracing is unclear, and to be effective, trusted, and widely adopted such technology must overcome several challenges.

Methods and analysisWe will perform a rapid systematic review to assess the effectiveness of automated and semi-automated digital tools for contact tracing, and identify key considerations for successful implementation, to inform the control of COVID-19. We will search PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO Medical COVID information portal, OVID Global Health, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, BioRxiv, and arXiv for peer-reviewed and pre-print papers on automated or semi-automated digital tools for contact tracing of COVID-19, another respiratory disease with pandemic potential (limited to SARS, MERS, or pandemic influenza), or Ebola, in human populations. Studies will be eligible if published in English between 1 January 2000 and 14 April 2020. We will synthesise study findings narratively and will consider meta-analysis if [&ge;] 3 suitable studies with comparable interventions and outcomes are available.

18850,Alcohol Consumption is Associated with Poor Prognosis in Obese Patients with COVID-19: a Mendelian Randomization Study using UK Biobank,"BackgroundAcute and chronic alcohol abuse have adverse impacts on both the innate and adaptive immune response, which may result in reduced resistance to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and promote the progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, there are no large population-based data evaluating potential causal associations between alcohol consumption and COVID-19.

MethodWe conducted a Mendelian randomization study using data from UK Biobank to explore the association between alcohol consumption and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and serious clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. A total of 12,937 participants aged 50-83 who tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 16 March to 27 July 2020 (12.1% tested positive) were included in the analysis. The exposure factor was alcohol consumption. Main outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 positivity and death in COVID-19 patients. We generated weighted and unweighted allele scores using three genetic variants (rs1229984, rs1260326, and rs13107325) and applied the allele scores as the instrumental variables to assess the effect of alcohol consumption on outcomes. Analyses were conducted separately for white participates with and without obesity.

ResultsOf the 12,937 participants, 4,496 were never or infrequent drinkers and 8,441 were frequent drinkers. (including 1,156 light drinkers, 3,795 moderate drinkers, and 3,490 heavy drinkers). Both logistic regression and Mendelian randomization analyses found no evidence that alcohol consumption was associated with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in participants either with (OR=0.963, 95%CI 0.800-1.159; q =1.000) or without obesity (OR=0.891, 95%CI 0.755-1.053; q =.319). However, frequent drinking (HR=1.565, 95%CI 1.012-2.419; q =.079), especially heavy drinking (HR=2.071, 95%CI 1.235-3.472; q =.054), was associated with higher risk of death in patients with obesity and COVID-19, but not in patients without obesity. Notably, the risk of death in frequent drinkers with obesity increased slightly with the average amount of alcohol consumed weekly (HR=1.480, 95%CI 1.059-2.069; q =.099).

ConclusionsOur findings suggested alcohol consumption may had adverse effects on the progression of COVID-19 in white participants with obesity, but was not associate with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Fan, X.; Liu, Z.; Poulsen, K.

One key aspect to transition safely out of lockdown is to continuously test the population for infected subjects. Currently, detection is performed at points of care using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR), and requires dedicated professionals and equipment. Here, we developed a protocol based on Reverse Transcribed Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) for detection of SARS-CoV-2. This protocol is applied directly on SARS-CoV-2 nose and throat swabs, with no RNA purification step required. We tested this protocol on over 180 suspected patients, and compared its results to the standard method. We further succeeded to apply the protocol on self-sampled saliva from confirmed cases.

5219,Optimal strategies for quarantine stopping in France. General expected patterns of strategies focusing on contact between age groups,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have implemented a complete lockdown of their population that may not be sustainable for long. To identify the best strategy to replace this full lockdown, sophisticated models that rely on mobility data have been developed. In this study, using the example of France as a case-study, we develop a simple model considering contacts between age classes to derive the general impact of partial lockdown strategies targeted at specific age groups. We found that epidemic suppression can only be achieved by targeting isolation of young and middle age groups with high efficiency. All other strategies tested result in a flatter epidemic curve, with outcomes in (e.g. mortality and health system over-capacity) dependent of the age groups targeted and the isolation efficiency. Targeting only the elderly can decrease the expected mortality burden, but in proportions lower than more integrative strategies involving several age groups. While not aiming to provide quantitative forecasts, our study shows the benefits and constraints of different partial lockdown strategies, which could help guide decision-making.","Roche, B.; Garchitorena, A.; Roiz, D.",2020-04-24,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.21.20073932,1,Benjamin Roche,IRD,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.21.20073932v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.21.20073932v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

Towards this goal, we report a simple, sensitive and rapid method to detect the virus using a targeted mass spectrometric approach, which can directly detect the presence of virus from naso-oropharyngeal swabs. Using a multiple reaction monitoring we can detect the presence of two peptides specific to SARS-CoV-2 in a 2.3 minute gradient run with 100% specificity and 90.4 % sensitivity when compared to RT-PCR. Importantly, we further show that these peptides could be detected even in the patients who have recovered from the symptoms and have tested negative for the virus by RT-PCR highlighting the sensitivity of the technique. This method has the translational potential of in terms of the rapid diagnostics of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 and can augment current methods available for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.","Singh, P.; Chakraborty, R.; Marwal, R.; V S, R.; Bhaskar, A.

ResultsEight studies, with a total of 1229 patients, were included. The frequency of myocardial injury was 16% (95% CI: 9% - 27%). The heterogeneity among studies was high (93%). Conclusions: Myocardial injury may occur in patients with COVID-19, with a frequency of 16% among current studies. Continuous research is needed to update these findings, as the pandemic evolves, and to define the implications of myocardial injury in the context of this infection.","De Lorenzo, A.; Kasal, D.; Tura, B.; Lamas, C.; Rey, H.",2020-05-22,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.18.20105866,1,Andrea De Lorenzo,Instituto Nacional de Cardiologia,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.18.20105866v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.18.20105866v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
14575,Single-strand RPA for rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA,"We report the single-strand Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (ssRPA) method, which merges the fast, isothermal amplification of RPA with subsequent rapid conversion of the double-strand DNA amplicon to single strands, and hence enables facile hybridization-based, high-specificity readout. We demonstrate the utility of ssRPA for sensitive and rapid (4 copies per 50 {micro}L reaction within 10 min, or 8 copies within 8 min) visual detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA spiked samples, as well as clinical saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs in VTM or water, on lateral flow devices. The ssRPA method promises rapid, sensitive, and accessible RNA detection to facilitate mass testing in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kim, Y.; Yaseen, A. B.; Kishi, J. Y.; Hong, F.; Saka, S.

11588,Size Dependent Particle Removal Efficiency and Pressure Drop of a Dust Cleaning Material For Use as Facemask Filters for Protection during COVID-19,"COVID-19 pandemic has caused a severe demand for facemasks, and this has resulted in the use of those made from alternate media. As SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily due to airborne droplets, it is critical to verify the filtration efficiency of these alternate media based facemasks. While several media are being tested and used, commercially available dust cleaners have shown reasonable filtration efficiency. This may also be due to the potential electrostatic charge on the surface which enhances capture of the fine particles. In this manuscript, we report the size dependent filtration efficiency studied systematically in a filter holder-based system as 47 mm punches; and test results on a mannequin that was 3D printed wearing a bandana mask that was placed in a chamber.","Dhanraj, D.; Choudhary, S.; Raven, P.; Biswas, P.",2020-07-15,Occupational And Environmental Health,10.1101/2020.07.13.20151985,1,Pratim Biswas,Washington University in Saint Louis,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20151985v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20151985v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA

We investigate how the geographical distance of working adults to the epicenter of Wuhan predicts their burnout. Preliminary results of a survey of 308 working adults in 53 cities showed working adults distance to the epicenter of Wuhan had an inverted U-shaped relationship with their burnout. Such results help to identify regions where people would need more psychiatric assistance, carrying direct implications to healthcare practitioners and policymakers.","Zhang, S.

6969,"Early Safety Indicators of COVID-19 ConvalescentPlasma in 5,000 Patients","BackgroundConvalescent plasma is the only antibody based therapy currently available for COVID-19 patients. It has robust historical precedence and sound biological plausibility. Although promising, convalescent plasma has not yet been shown to be safe as a treatment for COVID-19.

MethodsThus, we analyzed key safety metrics after transfusion of ABO-compatible human COVID-19 convalescent plasma in 5,000 hospitalized adults with severe or life-threatening COVID-19, with 66% in the intensive care unit, as part of the US FDA Expanded Access Program for COVID-19 convalescent plasma.

ResultsThe incidence of all serious adverse events (SAEs) in the first four hours after transfusion was <1%, including mortality rate (0.3%). Of the 36 reported SAEs, there were 25 reported incidences of related SAEs, including mortality (n=4), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO; n=7), transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI; n=11), and severe allergic transfusion reactions (n=3). However, only 2 (of 36) SAEs were judged as definitely related to the convalescent plasma transfusion by the treating physician. The seven-day mortality rate was 14.9%.

ConclusionGiven the deadly nature of COVID-19 and the large population of critically-ill patients included in these analyses, the mortality rate does not appear excessive. These early indicators suggest that transfusion of convalescent plasma is safe in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

13654,Multi-organ Proteomic Landscape of COVID-19 Autopsies,"The molecular pathology of multi-organ injuries in COVID-19 patients remains unclear, preventing effective therapeutics development. Here, we report an in-depth multi-organ proteomic landscape of COVID-19 patient autopsy samples. By integrative analysis of proteomes of seven organs, namely lung, spleen, liver, heart, kidney, thyroid and testis, we characterized 11,394 proteins, in which 5336 were perturbed in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Our data showed that CTSL, rather than ACE2, was significantly upregulated in the lung from COVID-19 patients. Dysregulation of protein translation, glucose metabolism, fatty acid metabolism was detected in multiple organs. Our data suggested upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, hyperinflammation might be triggered which in turn induces damage of gas exchange barrier in the lung, leading to hypoxia, angiogenesis, coagulation and fibrosis in the lung, kidney, spleen, liver, heart and thyroid. Evidence for testicular injuries included reduced Leydig cells, suppressed cholesterol biosynthesis and sperm mobility. In summary, this study depicts the multi-organ proteomic landscape of COVID-19 autopsies, and uncovered dysregulated proteins and biological processes, offering novel therapeutic clues.

9808,Seroprevalence against COVID-19 and follow-up of suspected cases in primary health care in Spain,"BackgroundDuring the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic little information has been available about patients with mild or moderate symptoms attended and followed in the primary care setting, most of whom had an unknown status for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

ObjectivesWe aim to measure the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community sample of asymptomatic individuals and among symptomatic patients (without confirmed diagnosis) followed in a primary care setting.

As a secondary objective, we estimated the proportions of symptomatic patients seeing at an emergency department (ED), hospitalized or dying, and identified the most important clinical symptoms associated with a positive infection.

MethodsFrom April 21 to April 24 2020, we selected a random sample of 600 individuals stratified by age groups, from a total population of 19,899 individuals from a community area in Barcelona (study population 1). From April 29 to May 5 2020, we also invited all the patients that had been followed by general practitioners (GPs) (study population 2).

We used for both populations COVID-19 Rapid lateral flow immunoassay which qualitatively assesses the presence of patient-generated IgG and IgM in approximately 10-15 minutes.

The prevalence (95% confidence intervals [CI]) of infection (past and current) was defined as the proportion of individuals with antibody seropositivity. Odds ratios (ORs) for a positive test result were estimated using logistic regression analysis.

ResultsThree hundred and eleven asymptomatic individuals from the randomly selected sample accepted to participate in the study. The overall mean age was 43.7 years (SD 21.79, range 1-94) and 55% were women. Seventeen individuals were seropositive for IgM and/or IgG, resulting an overall prevalence of 5,47% (95% CI, 3.44-8.58).

Six-hundred and thirty-four symptomatic patients were followed by GPs. The overall mean age was 46.97 years (SD 20.05, range 0-92) and 57.73% were women. Of these, 244 patients (38.49%) were seropositive for IgM and/or IgG.

During the follow-up period, 27.13% of symptomatic patients attended the ED, 11.83% were hospitalized and about 2% died.

Results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the OR for a positive test was significantly increased in patients who had fever (>38{degrees}C), ageusia and contact with a patient diagnosed with COVID-19.

ConclusionsThe seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic individuals in the general population was lower than expected.

Approximately 40% of the symptomatic patients followed by GPs during the peak months of the pandemic in Barcelona, were positive. Fever (>38{degrees}C), anosmia, ageusia and contact with a patient diagnosed with COVID-19 were associated with a positive test result.","Brotons, C.; Serrano, J.; Fernandez, D.; Garcia-Ramos, C.; Ichazo, B.; Lemaire, J.; Montenegro, P.; Moral, I.; Perez- Wienese, R.; Pitarch, M.; Puig, M.; Vilella, M.

12944,Evaluating the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions for SARS-CoV-2 on a global scale,"In the absence of a viable pharmaceutical intervention for SARS-CoV-2, governments have implemented a range of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to curb the spread of infection of the virus and the disease caused by the virus, now known as COVID-19. Given the associated social and economic costs, it is critical to enumerate the individual impacts of NPIs to aid in decision-making moving forward. We used globally reported SARS-CoV-2 cases to fit a Bayesian model framework to estimate transmission associated with NPIs in 26 countries and 34 US states. Using a mixed effects model with country level random effects, we compared the relative impact of other NPIs to national-level household confinement measures and evaluated the impact of NPIs on the global trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic over time. We observed heterogeneous impacts of the easing of restrictions and estimated an overall reduction in infection of 23% (95% CI: 18-27%) associated with household confinement, 10% (95% CI: 1-18%) with limits on gatherings, 12% (95% CI: 5-19%) with school closures and 17% (95% CI: 6-28%) with mask policies. We estimated a 12% (95% CI: 9-15%) reduction in transmission associated with NPIs overall. The implementation of NPIs have substantially reduced acceleration of COVID-19. At this early time point, we cannot determine the impact of the easing of restrictions and there is a need for continual assessment of context specific effectiveness of NPIs as more data become available.","Esra, R.

7332,Estimating the true (population) infection rate for COVID-19: A Backcasting Approach with Monte Carlo Methods,"Differences in COVID-19 testing and tracing across countries, as well as changes in testing within each country overtime, make it difficult to estimate the true (population) infection rate based on the confirmed number of cases obtained through RNA viral testing. We applied a backcasting approach, coupled with Monte Carlo methods, to estimate a distribution for the true (population) cumulative number of infections (infected and recovered) for 15 countries where reliable data are available. We find a positive relationship between the testing rate per 1,000 people and the implied true detection rate of COVID-19, and a negative relationship between the proportion who test positive and the implied true detection rate. Our estimates suggest that the true number of people infected across our sample of 15 developed countries is 18.2 (5-95% CI: 11.9-39.0) times greater than the reported number of cases. In individual countries, the true number of cases exceeds the reported figure by factors that range from 1.7 (5-95% CI: 1.1-3.6) for Australia to 35.6 (5-95% CI: 23.2-76.3) for Belgium.","Phipps, S.

4420,The effect of Arbidol Hydrochloride on reducing mortality of Covid-19 patients: a retrospective study of real world date from three hospitals in Wuhan,"BACKGROUNDThe worldwide COVID-19 pandemic is increasing exponentially and demands an effective and promising therapy at most emergency.

METHODSWe have assembled a cohort consisting 504 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Detailed information on patients characteristics and antiviral medication use during their stay at designated hospitals along with their pre and post treatment results were collected. The study objective is to evaluate the treatment efficacy of Arbidol, together with the concurrent drugs Oseltamivir and Lopinavir/Ritonavir on mortality and lesion absorption based on chest CT scan.

FINDINGSThe overall mortality rate was 15.67% in the cohort. The older age, lower SpO2 level, larger lesion, early admission date, and the presence of pre-existing conditions were associated with higher mortality. After adjusting for the patients age, sex, pre-existing condition, SpO2, lesion size, admission date, hospital, and concurrent antiviral drug use, Arbidol was found promising and associated with reduced mortality. The OR for Arbidol is 0{middle dot}183 (95% CI, 0{middle dot}075 to 0{middle dot}446; P<0{middle dot}001).

14572,Perturbations in the mononuclear phagocyte landscape associated with COVID-19 disease severity,"Monocytes and dendritic cells are crucial mediators of innate and adaptive immune responses during viral infection, but misdirected responses by these cells might contribute to immunopathology. A comprehensive map of the mononuclear phagocyte (MNP) landscape during SARS-CoV-2 infection and concomitant COVID-19 disease is lacking. We performed 25-color flow cytometry-analysis focusing on MNP lineages in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. While redistribution of monocytes towards intermediate subset and decrease in circulating DCs occurred in response to infection, severe disease associated with appearance of Mo-MDSC-like cells and a higher frequency of pre-DC2. Furthermore, phenotypic alterations in MNPs, and their late precursors, were cell-lineage specific and in select cases associated with severe disease. Finally, unsupervised analysis revealed that the MNP profile, alone, could identify a cluster of COVID-19 non-survivors. This study provides a reference for the MNP response to clinical SARS-CoV-2 infection and unravel myeloid dysregulation associated with severe COVID-19.","Kvedaraite, E.; Hertwig, L.; Sinha, I.; Ponzetta, A.; Hed Myrberg, I.; Lourda, M.; Dzidic, M.; Akber, M.; Klingstrom, J.; Folkesson, E.; Muvva, R.; Chen, P.; Brighenti, S.; Norrby-Teglund, A.; Eriksson, L.

21589,Neighbourhood-level risk factors of COVID-19 incidence and mortality,"BackgroundRacialized and low income communities face disproportionally high rates of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection and death. However, data on inequities in COVID-19 across granular categories of socio-demographic characteristics is more sparse.

MethodsNeighbourhood-level counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Ontario, Canada recorded as of July 28th, 2020 were extracted from provincial and local reportable infectious disease surveillance systems. Associations between COVID-19 incidence and mortality and 18 neighbourhood-level measures of immigration, race, housing and socio-economic characteristics were estimated with Poisson generalized linear mixed models. Housing characteristic variables were subsequently added to models to explore if housing may have a confounding influence on the relationships between immigration, race, and socio-economic status and COVID-19 incidence.

ResultsThere were large inequities in COVID-19 incidence and mortality across the socio-demographic variables examined. Neighbourhoods having a higher proportion immigrants, racialized populations, large households and low socio-economic status were associated with COVID-19 risk. Adjusting for housing characteristics, especially unsuitably crowded housing, attenuated COVID-19 risks. However persistent risk remained for neighbourhoods having high proportions of immigrants, racialized populations, and proportion of Black, Latin American, and South Asian residents.

ConclusionsSocio-demographic factors account for some of the neighbourhood-level differences in COVID-19 across Ontario. Housing characteristics account for a portion, but not all, of the excess burden of COVID-19 experienced by immigrant, racialized, low income and low education populations.","Van Ingen, T.; Brown, K.

21103,Modelling pooling strategies for SARS-CoV-2 testing in a university setting,"Pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are important elements in the Covid-19 pandemic, and until vaccines are made widely available there remains a reliance on testing to manage the spread of the disease, alongside non-pharmaceutical interventions such as measures to reduce close social interactions. In the UK, many universities opened for blended learning for the 2020-2021 academic year, with a mixture of face to face and online teaching. In this study we present a simulation framework to evaluate the effectiveness of different asymptomatic testing strategies within a university setting, across a range of transmission scenarios. We show that when positive cases are clustered by known social structures, such as student households, the pooling of samples by these social structures can substantially reduce the total cost of conducting RT-qPCR tests. We also note that routine recording of quantitative RT-qPCR results would facilitate future modelling studies.","Hemani, G.; Thomas, A. C.; Walker, J.

13221,Telmisartan for treatment of Covid-19 patients: an open randomized clinical trial. Preliminary report.,"BackgroundCovid-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is associated with significant respiratory-related morbidity and mortality. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been postulated as tentative pharmacological agents to treat Covid-19-induced lung inflammation.

Trial designThis trial is a parallel group, randomized, two arm, open label, multicenter superiority trial with 1:1 allocation ratio.

MethodsParticipants included patients who were 18 years of age or older and who had been hospitalized with confirmed Covid-19 with 4 or fewer days since symptom onset. Exclusion criteria included intensive care unit admission prior to randomization and use of angiotensin receptor blocker or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors at admission. Participants in the treatment arm received telmisartan 80 mg bid during 14 days plus standard care. Participants in the control arm received standard care alone.

Primary outcome was to achieve significant reductions in plasma levels of C-reactive protein in telmisartan treated Covid-19 patients at day 5 and 8 after randomization. Key secondary outcomes included time to discharge evaluated at 15 days after randomization and admission to ICU and death at 15-and 30-days post randomization. We present here a preliminary report.

ResultsA total of 78 patients were included in the interim analysis, 40 in the telmisartan and 38 in the control groups. CRP levels at day 5 in the control group were 51.1 {+/-} 44.8 mg/L (mean {+/-} SD; n=28) and in the telmisartan group were 24.2 {+/-} 31.4 mg/L (mean {+/-} SD; n=32, p<0.05). At day 8, CRP levels were 41.6 {+/-} 47.6 mg/L (mean {+/-} SD; n=16) and 9.0 {+/-} 10.0 mg/L (mean {+/-} SD; n=13, p < 0.05) in the control and telmisartan groups, respectively. Also, analysis of time to discharge by Kaplan-Meier method showed that telmisartan treated patients had statistically significant lower time to discharge (median time to discharge control group=15 days; telmisartan group=9 days). No differences were observed for ICU admission or death. No significant adverse events related to telmisartan were reported.

ConclusionsIn the present preliminary report, despite the small number of patients studied, ARB telmisartan, a well-known inexpensive safe antihypertensive drug, administered in high doses, demonstrates anti-inflammatory effects and improved morbidity in hospitalized patients infected with SARS -CoV-2, providing support for its use in this serious pandemia (NCT04355936).","Duarte, M.; Pelorosso, F.

8206,Preliminary analysis of scRNA sequencing of children's lung tissues excludes the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry related genes as the key reason for the milder syndromes of COVID-19 in children,"To explore whether the expression levels of viral-entry associated genes might contribute to the milder symptoms in children, we analyzed the expression of these genes in both children and adults lung tissues by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Both scRNA-seq and IHC analyses showed comparable levels of the key genes for SARS-CoV-2 entry in children and adults, including ACE2, TMPRSS2 and FURIN, suggesting that instead of lower virus intrusion rate, other factors are more likely to be the key reasons for the milder symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infected children.","Tao, Y.; Yang, R.; Wen, C.; Fan, J.; Ma, J.; He, Q.; Zhao, Z.; Song, X.; Chen, H.; Shi, G.; Yin, M.; Fang, N.; Zhang, H.; Chen, H.; Mo, X.",2020-09-29,Respiratory Medicine,10.1101/2020.05.25.20110890,2,Xi Mo,"The Laboratory of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Pediatric Translational Medicine Institute, Shanghai Children\'s Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University ",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.25.20110890v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.25.20110890v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

9162,Cumulative Active and Recovery Rates Based Criterion for Gradual Lockdown Exit: A Global Observation of SARS Cov-2 Management,"On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared SARS-CoV-2 pandemic; and at present there are over 6 million cases across the globe. Based on the interim guidelines of WHO, most of the countries opted for social distancing with lockdown as the only way to control the pandemic. This led to  Manufacturing shut down, which acted as a spanner in the wheel for international supply chain leading to pressure on governments to review the protocols of the lockdown. We studied epidemiological parameters for 18 countries and obtained crossover time point referring to cumulative case active and case recovery rates and the time point for the peak positive confirmation rate in a time window of 92 days; and linked with the respective governmental decisions. For countries awaiting crossover, time series non-linear models could be used for predicting the crossover point. A sample study was carried out for India. The median time for reaching crossover for 12 countries was 37 days, while peak positive confirmation rate was 30 days after their first intervention. These countries enforced strict lockdown regulations and have shown constant improvement in their recovery rate even after crossover time point. A phase wise relaxation of lockdown is evident after crossover point in most of these countries. The crossover time point with the subsequent increasing recovery rate can be a strategy for lockdown relaxation as evident from the experiences of few countries. Also, we propose a criterion based on 28 cumulative recovery and fatality rate for micro-management of lockdown.","Raje, D. V.; Bajaj, A.; Chakraborty, M.; Purohit, H.

15754,Dynamic Modeling of Reported Covid-19 Cases and Deaths with Continuously Varying Case Fatality and Transmission Rate Functions,"In this paper, we propose an enhanced SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Death) model with time varying case fatality and transmission rates for confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19. We show that when case fatalities and transmission rates are represented by simple Sigmoid functions, historical cases and fatalities can be fit with a relative-root-mean-squared-error accuracy on the order of 2% for most American states over the period from initial cases to July 28 (2020). We find that the model is most accurate for states that so far had not shown signs of multiple waves of the disease (such as New York), and least accurate for states where transmission rates increased after initially declining (such as Hawaii). For such states, we propose an alternate multi-phase model. Both the base model and multi-phase model provide a way to explain historical reported cases and deaths with a small set of parameters, which in the future can enable analyses of uncertainty and variations in disease progression across regions.","Lyu, M.; Hall, R.",2020-09-27,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.09.25.20201905,1,Mingdong Lyu,"Epstein Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Southern California",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.25.20201905v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.25.20201905v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
16906,Percentage HScore confirms low incidence of secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in hospitalised COVID-19 patients,"ObjectiveIt has been assumed that a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients show evidence of hyperinflammation of which secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) is the most severe manifestation. To facilitate diagnosis of sHLH the HScore has been developed and validated. We set out to examine the prevalence of sHLH-like hyperinflammation in COVID-19.

MethodsWe retrospectively examined HScore parameters in 626 COVID-19 cases admitted to our institute of which 567 were suitable for analysis and compared these to a cohort of confirmed infection associated sHLH cases. To account for missing data, we calculated the maximum possible HScore of the recorded parameters (%HScore).

ResultsEarly measurement of HScore parameters (day -1 to 4 from diagnosis) strongly predicted the %HScore over the course of the admission (p <0.0001). The retrospective cohort of sHLH showed significantly higher %HScores as compared to COVID-19 (median 73.47 vs 18.13 respectively, p <0.0001). The overall prevalence of individuals with an 80% probability of sHLH in our COVID-19 cohort was 1.59% on admission and only rose to 4.05% during the whole disease course. In the small cohort with scores suggestive of sHLH, there was no excess mortality compared with the whole cohort. %HScores were higher in younger patients (p<0.0001) and did not reliably predict outcome at any cut-off value (AUROC 0.533, p=0.211; OR 0.99).

ConclusionSurprisingly, these findings show that sHLH-type hyperinflammation is not prevalent in COVID-19, and %HScores do not predict outcome. Therefore, new algorithms are required to optimise case selection for clinical trials of targeted anti-inflammatory interventions.","Ardern-Jones, M. R.; Stammers, M.; Phan, H. T.

12890,Evaluation of Serological SARS-CoV-2 Lateral Flow Assays for Rapid Point of Care Testing,"BackgroundRapid point-of-care tests (POCTs) for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies vary in performance. A critical need exists to perform head-to-head comparison of these assays.

MethodsPerformance of fifteen different lateral flow POCTs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was performed on a well characterized set of 100 samples. Of these, 40 samples from known SARS-CoV-2-infected, convalescent individuals (average of 45 days post symptom onset) were used to assess sensitivity. Sixty samples from the pre-pandemic era (negative control), that were known to have been infected with other respiratory viruses (rhinoviruses A, B, C and/or coronavirus 229E, HKU1, NL63 OC43) were used to assess specificity. The timing of seroconversion was assessed on five POCTs on a panel of 272 longitudinal samples from 47 patients of known time since symptom onset.

ResultsFor the assays that were evaluated, the sensitivity and specificity for any reactive band ranged from 55%-97% and 78%-100%, respectively. When assessing the performance of the IgM and the IgG bands alone, sensitivity and specificity ranged from 0%-88% and 80%-100% for IgM and 25%-95% and 90%-100% for IgG. Longitudinal testing revealed that median time post symptom onset to a positive result was 7 days (IQR 5.4, 9.8) for IgM and 8.2 days (IQR 6.3 to 11.3).

ConclusionThe testing performance varied widely among POCTs with most variation related to the sensitivity of the assays. The IgM band was most likely to misclassify pre-pandemic samples. The appearance of IgM and IgG bands occurred almost simultaneously.","Conklin, S. E.; Martin, K.; Manabe, Y. C.; Schmidt, H. A.; Keruly, M.; Klock, E.; Kirby, C. S.; Baker, O. R.; Fernandez, R.

4350,"Clinical characteristics of 34 COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU in Hangzhou, China","IntroductionThe purpose of the study was to summarize the clinical and laboratory characteristics of the coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted to intensive care unit.

MethodsWe tracked the data until March 5, 2020. The cases in our cohort were divided into cases only received noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and cases required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The characteristics between the two groups were compared.

Results34 cases were included in the study. The complications rate (including, acute liver injury, acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury) were higher in IMV cases. Lymphocytopenia and neutrophilia occurred in most cases in both groups on the admission day, however, lymphocyte levels dropped progressively and more severe lymphopenia occurred in IMV group. Increased amounts of plasma IL-6 and IL-10 were found in both groups on the admission day, the progressive decrease of which occurred in NIV cases rather than IMV cases, and the levels were higher in IMV cases during hospitalization.

ConclusionsLymphocytopenia, neutrophilia, and increase of IL-6 and IL-10 occurred in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in ICU, however, the dynamics of those were significantly different in IMV cases and NIV cases during hospitalization.","Zheng, Y.; Sun, L.; Xu, M.; Pan, J.; Zhang, Y.; Fang, X.; Fang, Q.; Cai, H.",2020-04-15,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.12.20062604,1,Hongliu Cai,"The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.12.20062604v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.12.20062604v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1631/jzus.b2000174
7829,COVID-19 pandemic brings a sedentary lifestyle: a cross-sectional and longitudinal study,"ObjectivesThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to pose profound challenges on society. Governments around the world have managed to mitigate its spread through strategies including social distancing; however, this may result in the adoption of sedentary lifestyle. This study aimed to investigate: 1) physical activity (PA) levels, sedentary behavior (SB) and sleep among young adults during COVID-19 epidemic, and 2) the change in these behaviors before and during the pandemic.

MethodsA total of 631 young adults (38.8% males) participated in the cross-sectional study and completed an online survey that included five components: general information, COVID-19 related issues, PA, SB, and sleep. For longitudinal study, PA, SB, and sleep data collected from 70 participants before and during COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed.

ResultsParticipants reported engaging in low PA, high SB and long sleep duration during COVID-19 pandemic. Females had greater concern for COVID-19 related issues and engaged in more prevention strategies than males. Moreover, a significant decline in PA while increase in both times spent in SB and sleep were determined after COVID-19 outbreak.

ConclusionThe results of this study demonstrated a sedentary lifestyle in young adults in responses to social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, which will assist health policy makers and practitioners in the development of population specific health education and behavior interventions during this pandemic and for other future events.

19522,Risk of adverse outcomes with COVID-19 in the Republic of Ireland,"AimsTo compare the risk of adverse outcomes (i.e. hospital/intensive care admission, death) in population sub-groups during two periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland.

MethodsWe analysed routinely-collected, publicly-available data on 67,900 people with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection between 29th Feb to 14th Nov 2020. This period encompassed two waves of infection and two corresponding national lockdowns. For two observational periods covering each wave (W1, W2), each ending 17-19 days before implementation of high-level national restrictions, we segmented the population based on age and underlying clinical conditions.

ResultsThe prevalence of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 was 1.4%. The risk of admission to hospital, admission to intensive care, and death was 7.2%, 0.9%, and 2.5%, respectively. Compared to younger confirmed cases, those aged [&ge;]65 y had increased risk of hospital admission (RR 5.61), ICU admission (RR 3.56), and death (RR 60.8). W2 was associated with more cases and fewer adverse events than W1. The risk of all adverse outcomes was reduced in W2 than in W1.

ConclusionsOngoing responses should consider the variation in risk of adverse outcomes between specific sub-groups.

24595,"High SARS-CoV-2 attack rates following exposure during singing events in the Netherlands, September-October 2020","Previous reports indicate that there may be an increased risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission during singing events. We describe SARS-CoV-2 transmission in six singing events from September-October 2020, across the Netherlands, with attack rates from 25-74%. We investigated potential routes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission for each event. Events included 9-21 persons, aged 20-79 years. SARS-CoV-2 transmission likely took place during five out of six events; a possible index case could be identified in four out of five clusters. Limited sequencing data was available, hampering interpretation of results. Indirect contact and droplet transmission (<1.5m) may have caused some cases, but are unlikely to explain the high attack rates. The previously published AirCoV2 model indicated that airborne transmission (via infectious droplets/ aerosols over longer distances (>1.5m)) due to singing is possible in case of supershedder presence ([&ge;]1010 RNA copies/mL). Also, airflow expelling respiratory droplets over longer distances (>1.5m) may have influenced transmission. In conclusion, a combination of transmission routes probably caused these five clusters. Proportions attributable to each route cannot be deduced. It is possible that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 due to singing (partly) led to the high attack rates observed in these clusters.","Shah, A. A.; Dusseldorp, F.; Veldhuijzen, I.

13708,"ESTIMATING CUMULATIVE COVID-19 INFECTIONS BY A NOVEL """"PANDEMIC RATE EQUATION""""","A fundamental problem dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic has been to estimate the rate of infection, since so many cases are asymptomatic and contagious just for a few weeks. For example, in the US, estimate the proportion P(t) = N/330 where N is the US total who have ever been infected (in millions)at time t (months, t = 0 being March 20). This is important for decisions on social restrictions, and allocation of medical resources, etc. However, the demand for extensive testing has not produced good estimates. In the US, the CDC has used the blood supply to sample for anti-bodies. Anti-bodies do not tell the whole picture, according to the Karolinska Instituet [2], many post infection cases show T-cell immunity, but no anti-bodies. We introduce a method based on a difference-differential equation (dde) for P(t). We emphasize that this is just for the present, with no prediction on how the pandemic will evolve. The dde uses only x = x (s), which is the number/million testing positive, and y = y (s), the number/million who have been tested for all time 0[&le;] s [&le;] t (months), with no assumptions on the dynamics of the pandemic. However, we need two parameters. First,{rho} , the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infected cases. Second,{tau} , the period of active infection when the virus can be detected. Both are random variables with distribution which can be estimated. For fixed{rho} , we prove uniform bounds O_FD O_INLINEFIG[Formula 1]C_INLINEFIGM_FD(1)C_FD are best possible, with range depending on{tau} .

7357,Agent-Based Simulation for Evaluation of Contact-Tracing Policies Against the Spread of SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundMany countries have already gone through several infection waves and mostly managed to successfully stop the exponential spread of SARS-CoV-2 through bundles of restrictive measures. Still, the danger of further waves of infections is omnipresent and it is apparent that every containment policy must be carefully evaluated and possibly replaced by a different, less restrictive policy, before it can be lifted. Tracing of contacts and consequential breaking of infection chains is a promising strategy to help containing the disease, although its precise impact on the epidemic is unknown.

ObjectiveIn this work we aim to quantify the impact of tracing on the containment of the disease and investigate the dynamic effects involved.

DesignWe developed an agent-based model that validly depicts the spread of the disease and allows for exploratory analysis of containment policies. We apply this model to quantify the impact of divverent variants of contact tracing in Austria and to derive general conclusions on contract tracing.

ResultsThe study displays that strict tracing can supplement up to 5% reduction of infectivity and that household quarantine comes at the smallest price regarding preventively quarantined people.

LimitationsThe results are limited by the validity of the modeling assumptions, model parameter estimates, and the quality of the parametrization data.

ConclusionsThe study shows that tracing is indeed an efficient measure to keep case numbers low but comes at a high price if the disease is not well contained. Therefore, contact tracing must be executed strictly and adherence within the population must be held up to prevent uncontrolled outbreaks of the disease.","Bicher, M.

23060,Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) Opportunities on Health Education (HE) during of mandatory social isolation context,"BackgroundRoutine care for prevention and health promotion has reduced significantly due to the Covid-19 pandemic and mandatory social isolation measures. In this context, it is necessary to identify and describe Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that provide opportunities for health education, promotion, and prevention aimed at the general population. The study is a systematic review of MOOCs on health education, health promotion, and prevention for the general population in a pandemic context.

MethodsWe developed a search for MOOC courses aimed at the general population on health education, health promotion, and prevention in different MOOC available platforms. We executed a descriptive analysis of the main characteristics of the selected MOOCs.

ResultsThere were 117 MOOCs chosen on Health education, promotion, and prevention for the general population. Coursera (40.3%) was the platform that offered the highest quantity of MOOCs; more than half of MOOCs language was in English (52.9%). The median duration time in hours of the selected MOOCs was 11 (IR 6-15). The predominant themes were """"Health promotion"""" (43%) and """"Food and nutrition"""" (31%), and the origin was mainly from Europe (37.8%).

ConclusionsMOOCs offerings in Health Education (HE) is diverse, predominantly in English, of European origin, and in health promotion issues. This study opens an opportunity to multiply initiatives in different territories, considering other languages and topics more akin to each territorial reality, allowing it to be a more equitable learning opportunity in times of pandemic and compulsory social isolation.

Since ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, when nifedipine is combined with ritonavir-containing antiviral drugs, there is a potential risk of drug-drug interaction. This study aimed to provide guidance on nifedipine treatment during and after co-administration with ritonavir-containing regimens using a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) analysis.

MethodsA PBPK/PD model was developed for nifedipine by the software of Simcyp(R), and the model was verified using published data. The effects of ritonavir on nifedipine exposures and systolic blood pressure were assessed for instant-release, sustained-release and controlled-release formulations. Moreover, various nifedipine regimens were investigated when co-administrated with and withdrawing ritonavir.

ResultsPBPK/PD models for three formulations of nifedipine were successfully established. The model predicted pharmacokinetic profiles of nifedipine were comparable to the published data. Ratios of predicted versus observed AUCDDI/AUCNifedipine of nifedipine were within 0.70- to 1.83-fold. Model simulations showed that the inhibitory effect of ritonavir on CYP3A4 increased the Cmax of nifedipine by 9.82-34.35 times and the AUC24h by 44.94-50.77 times at steady state. Moreover, nifedipine dose reduced to 1/16 of the regular dose during ritonavir co-administration could lead to severe hypotension.

ConclusionsRitonavir had a pronounced influence on the pharmacokinetics and antihypertensive effect of nifedipine. It is not recommended for patients to take nifedipine and ritonavir-containing regimens simultaneously.","Niu, W.-J.; Li, S.-Z.; Jin, S.-S.; Lin, X.-Y.; Zhang, M.-W.; Cai, W.-M.; Zhong, M.-K.; Xiang, X.-Q.; Jiao, Z.",2020-05-26,Pharmacology And Therapeutics,10.1101/2020.05.19.20106658,1,Zheng Jiao,"Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20106658v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20106658v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
4942,Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic: An Overview of Systematic Reviews,"BackgroundNavigating the rapidly growing body of scientific literature on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is challenging and ongoing critical appraisal of this output is essential. We aimed to collate and summarize all published systematic reviews on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

MethodsNine databases (Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Sciences, PDQ-Evidence, WHOs Global Research, LILACS and Epistemonikos) were searched from December 1, 2019 to March 24, 2020. Systematic reviews analyzing primary studies of COVID-19 were included. Two authors independently undertook screening, selection, extraction (data on clinical symptoms, prevalence, pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, diagnostic test assessment, laboratory and radiological findings) and quality assessment (AMSTAR 2). Meta-analysis on prevalence of clinical outcomes was performed.

ResultsEighteen systematic reviews were included; one was empty. Using AMSTAR 2, confidence in the results of 13 reviews was rated as """"critically low"""", one as """"low"""", one as """"moderate"""" and two as """"high"""". Symptoms of COVID-19 were (range values of point estimates): fever (82-95%), cough with or without sputum (58-72%), dyspnea (26-59%), myalgia or muscle fatigue (29-51%), sore throat (10-13%), headache (8- 12%) and gastrointestinal complaints (5-9%). Severe symptoms were more common in men. Elevated C-reactive protein (associated with lymphocytopenia) and lactate dehydrogenase, and slightly elevated aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, were commonly described. Thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of procalcitonin and cardiac troponin I were associated with severe disease. Chest imaging described a frequent pattern of uni- or bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity. Only one review investigated the impact of medication (chloroquine) but found no verifiable clinical data. All-cause mortality ranged from 0.3% to 14%.

ConclusionsConfidence in the results of most reviews was """"critically low"""". Future studies and systematic reviews should adhere to established methodologies. The majority of included systematic reviews were hampered by imprecise search strategy and no previous protocol submission.

2549,Heat inactivation of serum interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2,"The detection of serum antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is emerging as a new tool for the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis. Since many coronaviruses are sensitive to heat, heating inactivation of samples at 56 {degrees}C prior to testing is considered a possible method to reduce the risk of transmission, but the effect of heating on the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is still unclear. By comparing the levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation of serum at 56 {degrees}C for 30 minutes using a quantitative fluorescence immunochromatographic assay, we shown that heat inactivation significantly interferes with the levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The IgM levels of all the 34 serum samples (100%) from COVID-19 patients decreased by an average level of 53.56%. The IgG levels were decreased in 22 of 34 samples (64.71%) by an average level of 49.54%. Similar changes can also be observed in the non-COVID-19 diseases group (n=9). Of note, 44.12% of the detected IgM levels were dropped below the cut-off value after heating, suggesting heat inactivation can lead to false-negative results of these samples. Our results indicate that heat inactivation of serum at 56 {degrees}C for 30 minutes interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Heat inactivation prior to immunoanalysis is not recommended and the possibility of false-negative results should be considered if the sample was pre-inactivated by heating.","Hu, X.; An, T.; Situ, B.; Hu, Y.; Ou, Z.; Li, Q.; He, X.; Zhang, Y.; Tian, P.; Sun, D.; Rui, Y.; Wang, Q.; Ding, D.; Zheng, L.",2020-03-16,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.12.20034231,1,Lei Zheng,"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University.

22441,Associations of Race/Ethnicity and Other Demographic and Socioeconomic Factors with Vaccine Initiation and Intention During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States,"BackgroundTo date, there has been limited data available to understand the associations between race/ethnicity and socioeconomic and related characteristics with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine initiation and planned vaccination in the United States.

MethodsTo better characterize COVID-19 vaccinations nationally, we leveraged large cross-sectional surveys conducted between January and March 2021 with relatively complete race/ethnicity and socioeconomic data and nationally-representative of U.S. households to estimate trends in levels of COVID-19 vaccine initiation and vaccine intention. We further used survey data from January and March 2021 in adults aged 18-85 years to analyze the associations between race/ethnicity, education, pre-pandemic household income, and financial hardship during the pandemic and the adjusted odds of: 1) receipt of [&ge;]1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine; and 2) among those unvaccinated, the definite intention to receive a vaccine, controlling for other demographic and socioeconomic factors.

ResultsWe observed persistent disparities in vaccine initiation for non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic multiracial persons, and in vaccine intention for Blacks and multiracial persons, compared to non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Asians. In late March 2021, the prevalence estimates of Hispanics and Blacks receiving a vaccine were 12 percentage points and 8 percentage points lower than for Whites, respectively. Moreover, both education and income levels exhibited positive dose-response relationships with vaccine initiation (P for trend[&le;]01 and <.001, respectively). Substantial financial hardship was linked to 35-44% lower odds of vaccination (P<.001). The most common reasons for vaccine hesitancy were concerns about side effects and safety, with evidence of higher levels of concerns about vaccine safety among Blacks vs. Whites.

ConclusionsIn this large, nationally-representative study with relatively complete race/ethnicity and socioeconomic data, we find that being Black non-Hispanic and having the least education and income were each independently associated with a markedly lower likelihood of definitely planning to get vaccinated or having been vaccinated. In the ensuing months of the pandemic, addressing the persevering racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities in vaccination due to differential access and vaccine hesitancy is essential to mitigate the pandemics higher risks of infection and adverse health outcomes in Hispanic, Black, and socioeconomically-disadvantaged communities.","Kim, D.",2021-04-14,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.02.16.21251769,2,Daniel Kim,Northeastern University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.16.21251769v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.16.21251769v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
20503,The Effect of Frames on COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy,"In order to control the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19, it will be important to develop a communication strategy to counteract """"vaccine hesitancy"""". This paper reports the results of a survey experiment testing the impacts of several types of message content: the safety and efficacy of the vaccine itself, the likelihood that others will take the vaccine, and the possible role of politics in promoting the vaccine. In an original survey of 1123 American M-Turk respondents, we provided six different information conditions suggesting the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, the lack of safety/efficacy of the vaccine, the suggestion that most others would take the vaccine, the suggestion that most others would not take the vaccine, the suggestion that the vaccine is being promoted to gain greater control over individual freedom, and the suggestion that it is being rushed for political motivations. We compared the responses for those in the treatment groups with a control group who received no additional information. In comparison to the control group, those who received information about the safety/efficacy of the vaccine were more likely to report that they would take the vaccine, those who received information that others were reluctant to take the vaccine were more likely to report that they themselves would not take it, that other Americans would not take it, and that it was not important to get the vaccine, and those who received information about political influences on vaccine development expressed hesitancy to take it. Communication of effective messages about the vaccine will be essential for public health agencies that seek to promote vaccine take-up.","Palm, R.; Bolsen, T.; Kingsland, J.",2021-01-06,Health Policy,10.1101/2021.01.04.21249241,1,Risa Palm,Georgia State University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.04.21249241v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.04.21249241v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

The similarities and differences between the two countries healthcare systems have made cross-national comparisons an important source of insight into the strengths and weaknesses of their respective health systems (1). During the COVID-19 pandemic, both COVID-19 cases and deaths per capita have been higher in the United States than in Canada, while decline in gross domestic product has been 2.1% greater in Canada than in the U.S. (2). Greater economic losses in Canada may reflect more aggressive use of non-pharmaceutical measures such as business and school closures to reduce disease transmission. Per capita attack rates and deaths seen in the United States represent a counterfactual, which Canada might have experienced with less aggressive disease control measures.","Fisman, D.; Tuite, A.",2021-03-26,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.03.23.21253873,1,David Fisman,University of Toronto,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.23.21253873v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.23.21253873v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

MethodsThe study population included the 14,000 members of Leumit Health Services who were tested for COVID-19 infection from February 1st to April 30th 2020, and who had at least one previous blood test for plasma 25(OH)D level. """"Suboptimal"""" or """"low"""" plasma 25(OH)D level was defined as plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D, or 25(OH)D, concentration below 30 ng/mL.

ResultsOf 7,807 individuals, 782 (10.1%) were COVID-19-positive, and 7,025 (89.9%) COVID-19-negative. The mean plasma vitamin D level was significantly lower among those who tested positive than negative for COVID-19 [19.00 ng/mL (95% confidence interval [CI] 18.41-19.59) vs. 20.55 (95% CI 20.32-20.78)]. Univariate analysis demonstrated an association between low plasma 25(OH)D level and increased likelihood of COVID-19 infection [crude odds ratio (OR) of 1.58 (95% CI 1.24-2.01, p<0.001)], and of hospitalization due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus [crude OR of 2.09 (95% CI 1.01-4.30, p<0.05)]. In multivariate analyses that controlled for demographic variables, and psychiatric and somatic disorders, the adjusted OR of COVID-19 infection [1.45 (95% CI 1.08-1.95, p<0.001)], and of hospitalization due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus [1.95 (95% CI 0.98-4.845, p=0.061)] were preserved. In the multivariate analyses, age over 50 years, male gender and low-medium socioeconomic status were also positively associated with the risk of COVID-19 infection; age over 50 years was positively associated with the likelihood of hospitalization due to COVID-19.

14612,Adjusted Dynamics of COVID-19 Pandemic due to Herd Immunity in Bangladesh,"Amid growing debate between scientists and policymakers on the trade-off between public safety and reviving economy during the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Bangladesh decided to relax the countrywide lockdown restrictions from the beginning of June 2020. Instead, the Ministry of Public Affairs officials have declared some parts of the capital city and a few other districts as red zones or high-risk areas based on the number of people infected in the late June 2020. Nonetheless, the COVID-19 infection rate had been increasing in almost every other part of the country. Ironically, rather than ensuring rapid tests and isolation of COVID-19 patients, from the beginning of July 2020, the Directorate General of Health Services restrained the maximum number of tests per laboratory. Thus, the health experts have raised the question of whether the government is heading toward achieving herd immunity instead of containing the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, the dynamics of the pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh are analyzed with the SIRD model. We demonstrate that the herd immunity threshold can be reduced to 31% than that of 60% by considering age group cluster analysis resulting in a total of 53.0 million susceptible populations. With the data of Covid-19 cases till July 22, 2020, the time-varying reproduction numbers are used to explain the nature of the pandemic. Based on the estimations of active, severe, and critical cases, we discuss a set of policy recommendations to improve the current pandemic control methods in Bangladesh.","Hoque, E.; Islam, M.

7206,Quantitative Analysis of the Effectiveness of Public Health Measures on COVID-19 Transmission,"Although COVID-19 has spread almost all over the world, social isolation is still a controversial public health policy and governments of many countries still doubt its level of effectiveness. This situation can create deadlocks in places where there is a discrepancy among municipal, state and federal policies. The exponential increase of the number of infectious people and deaths in the last days shows that the COVID-19 epidemics is still at its early stage in Brazil and such political disarray can lead to very serious results. In this work, we study the COVID-19 epidemics in Brazilian cities using early-time approximations of the SIR model in networks. Different from other works, the underlying network is constructed by feeding real-world data on local COVID-19 cases reported by Brazilian cities to a regularized vector autoregressive model, which estimates directional COVID-19 transmission channels (links) of every pair of cities (vertices) using spectral network analysis. Our results reveal that social isolation and, especially, the use of masks can effectively reduce the transmission rate of COVID-19 in Brazil. We also build counterfactual scenarios to measure the human impact of these public health measures in terms of reducing the number of COVID-19 cases at the epidemics peak. We find that the efficiency of social isolation and of using of masks differs significantly across cities. For instance, we find that they would potentially decrease the COVID-19 epidemics peak in Sao Paulo (SP) and Brasilia (DF) by 15% and 25%, respectively. We hope our study can support the design of further public health measures.","Silva, T.

Whether antibodies are important for the adaptive immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection needs to be determined. Here, 26 cases of COVID-19 in Jinan, China, were examined and shown to be mild or with common clinical symptoms and no cases of severe symptoms were found among these patients. A striking feature of some patients is that SARS-CoV-2 could exist in patients who have virus-specific IgG antibodies for a very long period, with two cases for up to 50 days. One COVID-19 patient who did not produce any SARS-CoV-2-bound IgG successfully cleared SARS-CoV-2 after 46 days of illness, revealing that without antibody-mediated adaptive immunity, innate immunity may still be powerful enough to eliminate SARS-CoV-2. Overall, this report may provide a basis for further analysis of both innate and adaptive immunity in SARS-CoV-2 clearance, especially in non-severe cases.

10844,Social-distancing effectiveness tracking of the COVID-19 hotspot Stockholm,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 outbreak in Stockholm, Sweden, is characterized by a near-absence of governmental interventions and high fatalities in the care home population. This study analyses the outbreak and the social-distancing effectiveness timeline in the general population and the care homes.

MethodsA novel distributed-compartmental, time-variant epidemiological model was designed specifically for COVID-19 transmission characteristics, featuring a/pre/symptomatic transmission, a non-linear hospital model, a weakly-coupled sub-model for the care-home population, and parametrized continuous social-distancing functions. The model parameters and the social-distancing timelines are determined by randomization and Monte-Carlo simulations analysing real-world data.

FindingsDespite a high initial reproduction number (3{middle dot}29) and the near-absence of governmental interventions, the model quantitated that the transmission rate in the general population was suppressed by 73%, and in the care homes by 79%. The measures in the care homes took effect 4{middle dot}8 days delayed; and if applied 4 or 8 days earlier, the fatalities could have been reduced by 63{middle dot}2% or 89{middle dot}9%. The infected population is estimated to 16{middle dot}2% (June 10). An expected underestimation of population immunity by antibody studies is confirmed. The infection fatality ratio extrapolates to 0{middle dot}61% (peak: 1{middle dot}34%). The model indicates a seasonal effect which effectively suppressed a new rise. An analysed large-scale public event had no large influence. The asymptomatic ratio was determined to 35%.

InterpretationThe proposed model and methods have proven to analyse a COVID-19 outbreak and to re-construct the social-distancing behaviour with unprecedented accuracy, confirming even minor details indicated by mobility-data analysis, and are applicable to other regions and other emerging infectious diseases of similar transmission characteristics. The self-regulation of the population in Stockholm, influenced by advices by the authorities, was able to suppress a COVID-19 outbreak to a level far beyond that the stringency index of governmental interventions suggests. Proper timing of effective measures in the care homes is important to reduce fatalities.","Oberhammer, J.",2020-07-02,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.30.20143487,2,Joachim Oberhammer,KTH Royal Institute of Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.20143487v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.20143487v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
11249,Predictive Analysis for COVID-19 Spread in India by Adaptive Compartmental Model,"The role of mathematical modelling in predicting spread of an epidemic is of vital importance. The purpose of present study is to develop and apply a computational tool for predicting evolution of different epidemiological variables for COVID-19 in India. We propose a dynamic SIRD (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead) and SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead) model for this purpose. In the dynamic model, time dependent infection rate is assumed for estimating evolution of different variables of the model. Parameter estimation of the model is the first step of the analysis which is performed by least square optimization of priori data. In the second step of the analysis, simulation is carried out by using evaluated parameters for prediction of the outbreak. The computational model has been validated against real data for COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. Time to reach peak, peak infected cases and total reported cases were compared with actual data and found to be in very good agreement. Next the model is applied for the case of India and various Indian states to predict different epidemiological parameters. Priori data was taken from the beginning of nation-wide lockdown on 24 March to 6 July. It was found that peak of the outbreak may reach in the month of August-September with maximum 4-5 lakhs active cases at peak. Total number of reported cases all over India would be in between three to five millions. State wise, Maharashtra, Tamilnadu and Delhi would be worst affected.","Singh, S.

23251,SARS-CoV-2-specific T Cell Memory is Sustained in COVID-19 Convalescents for 8 Months with Successful Development of Stem Cell-like Memory T Cells,"Memory T cells contribute to rapid viral clearance during re-infection, but the longevity and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells remain unclear. We conducted direct ex vivo assays to evaluate SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in COVID-19 convalescents up to 254 days post-symptom onset (DPSO). Here, we report that memory T cell responses were maintained during the study period. In particular, we observed sustained polyfunctionality and proliferation capacity of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Among SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells detected by activation-induced markers, the proportion of stem cell-like memory T (TSCM) cells increased, peaking at approximately 120 DPSO. Development of TSCM cells was confirmed by SARS-CoV-2-specific MHC-I multimer staining. Considering the self-renewal capacity and multipotency of TSCM cells, our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are long-lasting after recovery from COVID-19.

14041,Serum lipid profile changes and their clinical diagnostic significance in COVID-19 Mexican Patients,"BackgroundCOVID-19 has been recognized as an emerging and rapidly evolving health condition. For this reason, efforts to determine changes in laboratory parameters of COVID-19 patients as biomarkers are urgent. Lipids are essential components of the human body, and their modulation has been observed implicated in some viral infections.

MethodsTo evaluate the clinical diagnosis utility of the lipid profile changes in Mexican COVID-19 patients, the lipid profile of one hundred two COVID-19 positive patients from three hospitals in Culiacan, Sinaloa in northwest Mexico, was analyzed. ROC curves and binary logistic regression analysis were used as a predictive model to determine their clinical diagnostic utility.

ResultsSignificant changes in the serum lipid profile of patients with COVID-19, such as low levels of cholesterol, LDL, and HDL, while high triglycerides and VLDL were observed. The same abnormalities in the lipid profile among non-critical and critical COVID-19 patients were detected. The predictive model analysis suggests that cholesterol and LDL have AUC values of 0.710 and 0.769, respectively, for COVID-19 (p= 0.0002 and p= <0.0001), and LDL low levels might be a risk factor for critical COVID-19 (OR= 2.07, 95% IC: 1.18 to 3.63; p= 0.01).

ConclusionOur findings suggest that low cholesterol and LDL levels could be considered an acceptable predictor for COVID-19, and low levels of LDL might be a risk factor for critical COVID-19 patients.","Osuna-Ramos, J.

23522,Differential Impacts of COVID-19 Lockdowns on PM2.5 across the United States,"The COVID-19 pandemic has induced large-scale social, economic, and behavioral changes, presenting a unique opportunity to study how air pollution is affected by unprecedented societal shifts. At each of 455 PM2.5 monitoring sites across the United States, we conduct a causal inference analysis to determine the impacts of COVID-19 interventions and behavioral changes (""""lockdowns"""") on PM2.5 concentrations. Our approach allows for rigorous confounding adjustment and provides highly spatio-temporally resolved effect estimates. We find that, with the exception of the Southwest, most of the US experienced increases in PM2.5 during lockdown, compared to the concentrations expected under business-as-usual. To investigate possible drivers of this phenomenon, we use regression to characterize the relationship of many environmental, geographical, meteorological, mobility, and socioeconomic factors with the lockdown-attributable changes in PM2.5. Our findings have immense environmental policy relevance, suggesting that large-scale mobility and economic activity reductions may be insufficient to substantially and uniformly reduce PM2.5.","Chen, K.

5162,A simulation of a COVID-19 epidemic based on a deterministic SEIR model,"An epidemic disease caused by a new coronavirus has spread in Northern Italy with a strong contagion rate. We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 24, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and uncertainty of the different parameters, namely, the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time, the number of initially exposed individuals and infected people, the incubation and infectious periods and the fatality rate.

First, we perform an analysis of the results of the model, by varying the parameters and initial conditions (in order the epidemic to start, there should be at least one exposed or one infectious human). Then, we consider the Lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (April 28, 2020) and constraint the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (March 31) approximately, when there is a rapid decrease, with a reproduction ratio R0 = 3 initially, 1.36 at day 22 and 0.78 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is almost 15325 casualties, with 2.64 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit of the dead individuals is 4.25 days and the infectious period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57 %, and 2.36 % if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initially exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47 %. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infectious periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 versus 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 % versus 0.57 %), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Other choices of the set of parameters also provide a good fit of the data, but some of the results may not be realistic. Therefore, an accurate determination of the fatality rate and characteristics of the epidemic is subject to the knowledge of precise bounds of the parameters.

Besides the specific example, the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation measures, social distancing and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic. Hence, the importance to quantify the process to verify the effectiveness of the lockdown.","Carcione, J.

7797,A Rapid Review and Meta-Analysis of the Asymptomatic Proportion of PCR-Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Community Settings,"BackgroundUp to 80% of active SARS-CoV-2 infections are proposed to be asymptomatic based on cross-sectional studies. However, accurate estimates of the asymptomatic proportion require systematic detection and follow-up to differentiate between truly asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases. We conducted a rapid review and meta-analysis of current evidence regarding the asymptomatic proportion of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections based on methodologically-appropriate studies in community settings.

MethodsWe searched Medline and EMBASE for peer-reviewed articles, and BioRxiv and MedRxiv for pre-prints published prior to 05/05/2020. We included studies based in community settings that involved systematic PCR testing on participants and follow-up symptom monitoring regardless of symptom status. We extracted data on study characteristics, frequencies of PCR-confirmed infections by symptom status, and (if available) cycle threshold values and/or duration of viral shedding by symptom status. We computed estimates of the asymptomatic proportion and 95% confidence intervals for each study and overall using random effect meta-analysis.

FindingsWe screened 270 studies and included 6. The pooled estimate for the asymptomatic proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections was 11% (95% CI 4%-18%). Estimates of baseline viral load appeared to be similar for asymptomatic and symptomatic cases based on available data in three studies, though detailed reporting of cycle threshold values and natural history of viral shedding by symptom status was limited.

InterpretationThe asymptomatic proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections is relatively low when estimated from methodologically-appropriate studies. Further investigation into the degree and duration of infectiousness for asymptomatic infections is warranted.

23944,Determinants of COVID-19 outcomes: A systematic review.,"BackgroundThe current pandemic, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has claimed over a million lives worldwide in a year, warranting the need for more research into the wider determinants of COVID-19 outcomes to support evidence-based policies.

ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate what factors determined the mortality and length of hospitalisation in individuals with COVID-19.

Data SourceThis is a systematic review with data from four electronic databases: Scopus, Google Scholar, CINAHL and Web of Science.

Eligibility CriteriaStudies were included in this review if they explored determinants of COVID-19 mortality or length of hospitalisation, were written in the English Language, and had available full-text.

Study appraisal and data synthesisThe authors assessed the quality of the included studies with the Newcastle{square}Ottawa Scale and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality checklist, depending on their study design. Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed with risk of bias assessment tool for non-randomised studies. A narrative synthesis of the evidence was carried out. The review methods were informed by the Joana Briggs Institute guideline for systematic reviews.

ResultsThe review included 22 studies from nine countries, with participants totalling 239,830. The included studies quality was moderate to high. The identified determinants were categorised into demographic, biological, socioeconomic and lifestyle risk factors, based on the Dahlgren and Whitehead determinant of health model. Increasing age (ORs 1.04-20.6, 95%CIs 1.01-22.68) was the common demographic determinant of COVID-19 mortality while living with diabetes (ORs 0.50-3.2, 95%CIs -0.2-0.74) was one of the most common biological determinants of COVID-19 length of hospitalisation.

Review limitationMeta-analysis was not conducted because of included studies heterogeneity.

ConclusionCOVID-19 outcomes are predicted by multiple determinants, with increasing age and living with diabetes being the most common risk factors. Population-level policies that prioritise interventions for the elderly population and the people living with diabetes may help mitigate the outbreaks impact.

8412,New models of transmission of COVID-19 with time under the influence of meteorological determinants,"ObjectivesThis work aimed at modeling the progressions of COVID-19 cases in time in relation to meteorological factors in large cities of Brazil, Italy, Spain, and USA, and finding the viability of SARS-CoV-2 virus in different weather conditions based on models.

MethodsNew models constructed showing the relationship of the I' (the number of infected individuals divided by the total population of a city) with the independent variables -time, temperature, relative humidity, and wind velocity. The regression models fitting in the data were statistically validated by: 1) plot of observed and predicted response; 2) standardized residual plots showing the characteristics of errors; 3) adjusted [Formula] value; 4) the p value for the parameters associated with the various independent variables; and 5) the predictive power of the model beyond data points.

ResultsModels indicate that 1) the transmission of COVID-19 could be relatively high either for elevated temperatures with lower relative humidity or for lower temperatures with higher relative humidity conditions; 2) disease transmission is expected to be reduced more with higher wind velocity; 3) the rate of increase in the number of COVID-19 cases increases in one model with a constant rate and in the other two with varying rates in time. These transmission features seem to have connections with the structural components of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Under suitable meteorological conditions, the partial natural disappearance of COVID-19 pandemic could be possible.

ConclusionNew models for I' may be considered to understand the viability of the virus in the environment and future transmission of COVID-19.","Adhikari, A.; Ghosh, S.; Sen, M.

12113,Rhythmic components of COVID-19 daily cases in various countries,"Not only does COVID-19 pandemic encourage scientists to look for remedies and treatment schemes, but also identify the drivers of pathogenicity and spread of the virus.

The scope of this research consisted in identifying recurrence patterns and comparing the number of daily cases between various countries. Data for countries where at least 500 daily cases were recorded at least once (17 in Europe, 3 in North America, 7 in South America, 3 in Central America, 17 in Asia and 3 in Africa).

According to our evaluation, the dynamics recorded for 25 countries includes a 7-day statistically significant component. This statistically significant weekly component has been identified in 76% of the countries examined in Europe, 66% in North America, 71% in South America, and 18% in Asia. The range of this rhythmic component is low at the growth stage and increases at the stabilization and decrease stages.

The weekly phases feature shifting peaks depending on the country. In some cases, the phases shift, i.e. they are not limited strictly to certain days of the week. Due to range and phase variation, its explanation cannot be limited to strictly medical and social factors. In some cases, national incidence dynamics includes 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10-day periods.

5451,A demographic scaling model for estimating the total number of COVID-19 infections,"Understanding how widely COVID-19 has spread is critical for examining the pandemics progression. Despite efforts to carefully monitor the pandemic, the number of confirmed cases may underestimate the total number of infections. We introduce a demographic scaling model to estimate COVID-19 infections using an broadly applicable approach that is based on minimal data requirements: COVID-19 related deaths, infection fatality rates (IFRs), and life tables. As many countries lack reliable estimates of age-specific IFRs, we scale IFRs between countries using remaining life expectancy as a marker to account for differences in age structures, health conditions, and medical services. Across 10 countries with most COVID-19 deaths as of May 13, 2020, the number of infections is estimated to be four [95% prediction interval: 2-11] times higher than the number of confirmed cases. Cross-country variation is high. The estimated number of infections is 1.4 million (six times the number of confirmed cases) for Italy; 3.1 million (2.2 times the number of confirmed cases) for the U.S.; and 1.8 times the number of confirmed cases for Germany, where testing has been comparatively extensive. Our prevalence estimates, however, are markedly lower than most others based on local seroprevalence studies. We introduce formulas for quantifying the bias that is required in our data on deaths in order to reproduce estimates published elsewhere. This bias analysis shows that either COVID-19 deaths are severely underestimated, by a factor of two or more; or alternatively, the seroprevalence based results are overestimates and not representative for the total population.","Bohk-Ewald, C.; Dudel, C.; Myrskyla, M.",2020-05-26,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.04.23.20077719,3,Christina Bohk-Ewald,University of Helsinki,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.23.20077719v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.23.20077719v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1093/ije/dyaa198

Due to a paucity of robust evidence, we sought to assess the presenting characteristics of patients with Covid-19 and investigate factors associated with death.

MethodsRetrospective analysis of adults admitted with Covid-19 to Royal Oldham Hospital, UK. Logistic regression modelling was utilised to explore factors predicting death.

Results470 patients were admitted, of whom 169 (36%) died. The median age was 71 years (IQR 57-82), and 255 (54.3%) were men. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (n=218, 46.4%), diabetes (n=143, 30.4%) and chronic neurological disease (n=123, 26.1%). The most frequent complications were acute kidney injury (n=157, 33.4%) and myocardial injury (n=21, 4.5%).

22453,The Effect of NFL and NCAA Football Games on the Spread of COVID-19 in the United States: An Empirical Analysis,"ImportanceIn 2020 and early 2021, the National Football League (NFL) and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) had opted to host games in stadiums across the country. The in-person attendance of games has varied with time and from county to county. There is currently no evidence on whether limited in-person attendance of games has caused a substantial increase in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.

ObjectiveTo assess whether NFL and NCAA football games with limited in-person attendance have contributed to a substantial increase in COVID-19 cases in the counties they were held.

DesignIn this time-series cross-sectional study, we matched every county hosting game(s) with in-person attendance (treated) in 2020 and 2021 with a county that has an identical game history for up to 14 days (control). We employed a standard matching method to further refine this matched set so that the treated and matched control counties have similar population size, non-pharmaceutical intervention(s) in place, and COVID-19 trends. We assessed the effect of hosting games with in-person attendance using a difference-in-difference estimator.

SettingU.S. counties.

ParticipantsU.S. counties hosting NFL and/or NCAA games.

ExposureHosting NFL and/or NCAA games.

Main outcomes and measuresEstimating the impact of NFL and NCAA games with in-person attendance on new, reported COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents at the county-level up to 14 days post-game.

ResultsThe matching algorithm returned 361 matching sets of counties. The effect of in-person attendance at NFL and NCAA games on community COVID-19 spread is not significant as it did not surpass 5 new daily cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 residents on average.

Conclusions and relevanceThis time-series, cross-sectional matching study with a difference-in-differences design did not find an increase in COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents in the counties where NFL and NCAA games were held with in-person attendance. Our study suggests that NFL and NCAA football games hosted with limited in-person attendance do not cause a significant increase in local COVID-19 cases.

16346,Modelling testing and response strategies for COVID-19 outbreaks in remote Australian Aboriginal communities,"BackgroundRemote Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have potential to be severely impacted by COVID-19, with multiple factors predisposing to increased transmission and disease severity. Our modelling aims to inform optimal public health responses.

MethodsAn individual-based simulation model represented communities ranging from 100 to 3,500 people, comprised of large interconnected households. A range of strategies for case finding, quarantining of contacts, testing, and lockdown were examined, following the silent introduction of a case.

ResultsMultiple secondary infections are likely present by the time the first case is identified. Quarantine of close contacts, defined by extended household membership, can reduce peak infection prevalence from 60-70% to around 10%, but subsequent waves may occur when community mixing resumes. Exit testing significantly reduces ongoing transmission.

Concurrent lockdown of non-quarantined households for 14 days is highly effective for epidemic control and reduces overall testing requirements; peak prevalence of the initial outbreak can be constrained to less than 5%, and the final community attack rate to less than 10% in modelled scenarios. Lockdown also mitigates the effect of a delay in the initial response. Compliance with lockdown must be at least 80-90%, however, or epidemic control will be lost.

ConclusionsA SARS-CoV-2 outbreak will spread rapidly in remote communities.

7368,COVID-19 management in a UK NHS Foundation Trust with a High Consequence Infectious Diseases centre: a detailed descriptive analysis,"BackgroundRecent large national and international cohorts describe the baseline characteristics and outcome of hospitalised patients with COVID-19, however there is little granularity to these reports. We aimed to provide a detailed description of a UK COVID-19 cohort, focusing on clinical decisions and patient journeys.

MethodsWe retrospectively analysed the management and 28-day outcomes of 316 consecutive adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a large NHS Foundation Trust with a tertiary High Consequence Infectious Diseases centre in the North of England.

FindingsMost patients were elderly (median age 75) with multiple comorbidities. One quarter were admitted from residential or nursing care. Symptoms were consistent with COVID-19, with cough, fever and/or breathlessness in 90.5% of patients. Two thirds of patients had severe disease on admission. Mortality was 81/291 (27.8%). Most deaths were anticipated; decisions to initiate respiratory support were individualised after consideration of patient wishes, premorbid frailty and comorbidities, with specialist palliative care input where appropriate. 22/291 (7.6%) patients were intubated and 11/22 (50%) survived beyond discharge. Multiple logistic regression identified age as the most significant risk factor for death (OR 1.09 [95% CI 1.06 - 1.12] per year increase, p < 0.001).

InterpretationThese findings provide important clinical context to outcome data. Deaths were anticipated, occurring in patients with advance decisions on ceilings of treatment. Age was the most significant risk factor for death, confirming that demographic factors in the population are a major influence on hospital mortality rates.

24629,Tryptophan and arginine metabolism is significantly altered at the time of admission in hospital for severe COVID-19 patients: findings from longitudinal targeted metabolomics analysis,"The heterogeneity in severity and outcome of COVID-19 cases points out the urgent need for early molecular characterization of patients followed by risk-stratified care. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the fluctuations of serum metabolomic profiles of COVID-19 patients with severe illness during the different disease stages in a longitudinal manner. We demonstrate a distinct metabolomic signature in serum samples of 32 hospitalized patients at the acute phase compared to the recovery period, suggesting the tryptophan (tryptophan, kynurenine, and 3-hydroxy-DL-kynurenine) and arginine (citrulline and ornithine) metabolism as contributing pathways in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 with a potential link to the clinical severity of the disease. In addition, we provide evidence for glutamine metabolism in M2 macrophages as a complementary process and contribution of phenylalanine and tyrosine in the molecular mechanisms underlying the severe course of the infection. In conclusion, our results provide several functional metabolic markers for disease progression and severe outcome with potential clinical application.

ImportanceAlthough the host defense mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2 infection are still poorly described, they are of central importance in shaping the course of the disease and the possible outcome. Metabolomic profiling may complement the lacking knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying clinical manifestations and pathogenesis of COVID-19. Moreover, early identification of metabolomics{square}based biomarker signatures is proved to serve as an effective approach for the prediction of disease outcome. Here we provide the list of metabolites describing the severe, acute phase of the infection and bring the evidence of crucial metabolic pathways linked to aggressive immune responses. Finally, we suggest metabolomic phenotyping as a promising method for developing personalized care strategies in COVID-19 patients.","Ansone, L.; Ustinova, M.; Terentjeva, A.; Perkons, I.; Birzniece, L.; Rovite, V.; Rozentale, B.; Viksna, L.; Kolesova, O.; Klavins, K.; Klovins, J.",2021-04-06,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.03.31.21254699,1,Janis Klovins,Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.31.21254699v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.31.21254699v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA

A total of 225 serum/plasma specimens from 120 acute or convalescent COVID-19 individuals were included. Overall, IgG/IgA-FCI yielded the highest number of positives (n=179), followed by IgA-FCI (n=177), Roche ECLIA (n=175), IgG-FCI (n=172) and Diasorin CLIA (n=154). Positive percent agreement between FCI and compared immunoassays was highest for Roche ECLIA, ranging from 96.1% (IgG/IgA-FCI) to 97.7% (IgG-FCI), whereas negative percent agreement was higher between FCI and Diasosin CLIA, regardless of antibody isotype. A strong correlation (Rho:0.6-0.8) was found between IgG-FCI or IgA-FCI levels and antibodies quantified by Roche ECLIA and Diasorin CLIA. The trajectory of antibody levels delineated by the different immunoassays in 22 of patients with sequential specimens ([&ge;]3) was frequently discordant, with the exception of IgG and IgA determined by FCI assay and to a lesser extent antibodies quantified by Roche ECLIA and Diasorin CLIA.

15195,COVID-19 epidemic severity is associated with timing of non-pharmaceutical interventions,"Background: Unprecedented public health interventions including travel restrictions and national lockdowns have been implemented to stem the COVID-19 epidemic, but the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions is still debated. International comparisons are hampered by highly variable conditions under which epidemics spread and differences in the timing and scale of interventions. Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented. Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic growth in different settings. Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size. Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to interventions was not associated with epidemic severity, indicating that many locations experienced long periods of cryptic transmission. Interpretation: Locations where strong non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented earlier experienced much less severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality during the period of study.","Ragonnet-Cronin, M.; Boyd, O.; Geidelberg, L.; Jorgensen, D.; Nascimento, F.

18687,Evidence of the effectiveness of travel-related measures during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid systematic review,"ObjectiveTo review evidence of the effectiveness of travel measures implemented during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to recommend change on how evidence is incorporated in the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR).

DesignWe used an abbreviated preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis protocol (PRISMA-P) and a search strategy aimed to identify studies that investigated the effectiveness of travel-related measures (advice, entry and exit screening, medical examination or vaccination requirements, isolation or quarantine, the refusal of entry, and entry restrictions), pre-printed or published by June 1, 2020.

ResultsWe identified 29 studies, of which 26 were modelled (vs. observational). Thirteen studies investigated international measures while 17 investigated domestic measures (one investigated both), including suspended transportation (24 studies), border restrictions (21), and screening (5). There was a high level of agreement that the adoption of travel measures led to important changes in the dynamics of the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most of the identified studies investigated the initial export of cases out of Wuhan, which was found to be highly effective, but few studies investigated the effectiveness of measures implemented in other contexts. Early implementation was identified as a determinant of effectiveness. Most studies of international travel measures failed to account for domestic travel measures, and thus likely led to biased estimates. Poor data and other factors contributed to the low quality of the studies identified.

ConclusionTravel measures, especially those implemented in Wuhan, played a key role in shaping the early transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the effectiveness of these measures was short-lived. There is an urgent need to address important evidence gaps, but also a need to review the way in which evidence is incorporated in the IHR in the early phases of a novel infectious disease outbreak.

What is already known on this subject?O_LIPrevious reviews of the evidence from outbreaks of influenza and other infectious disease have generally found that there is limited evidence that travel-measures are effective at containing outbreaks.
C_LIO_LIHowever, it is unclear if the lessons from other infectious disease outbreaks would be relevant in the context of COVID-19.
C_LIO_LIBased on evidence at the time, WHO did not recommend any travel restrictions when it declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
C_LI

What does this study add?O_LIThis study rapidly reviews the evidence on the effectiveness of travel measures implemented in the early phase of the pandemic on epidemiological countries.
C_LIO_LIThe study investigated both international and domestic travel measures and a wide range of travel measures.
C_LIO_LIThe study finds that the domestic travel measures implemented in Wuhan were effective at reducing the importation of cases internationally and within China. The study also finds that travel measures are more effective when implemented earlier in the outbreak.
C_LIO_LIThe findings generate recommendations on how to incorporate evidence into the International Health Regulations and highlights important research gaps that remain.
C_LI

How might this affect future outbreaks?O_LIThe findings of this study suggest the need to decouple recommendations of travel measures from the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern.
C_LIO_LIHighlights the need to evaluate the potential effectiveness of travel measures for each outbreak, and not just assume effectiveness based on past outbreak scnearios.

In severe COVID-19 illness, there is significant up-regulation of complement and coagulation pathway, and negative correlation between NETosis and respiratory function (oxygen saturation). Interestingly, there is an early spike in the level of IL-6 gene expression in severe illness compared to moderate illness. With passing days post-onset, the level of IL-6 expression in severe illness approaches that in moderate illness. The data are consistent with IL-6 acting as a driver of NETosis in the early phase of severe COVID-19 illness, that results in a vicious cycle of NETosis-complement/coagulation-respiratory dysfunction. This has important consequence for timing of rational therapy with anti-IL-6 and NETosis inhibitors in severe COVID-19 illness.","Mukhopadhyay, S.; Sinha, S.; Mohapatra, S.

6645,Correlations of Mobility and Covid-19 Transmission in Global Data,"Assessing the contribution of mobility declines to the control of Covid-19 diffusion is an urgent challenge of global import. We analyze the temporal correlation between transmission rates and societal mobility levels using daily mobility data from Google and Apple in an international panel of 99 countries and a panel of all states in the United States. Reduced form regression estimates that flexibly control for time trends suggest that a 10 percentage point reduction in mobility is associated with a 0.04-0.07 reduction in the value of the effective reproduction number, R(t), depending on geographical region and modelling choice. According to these estimates, to avoid the critical value of R = 1, easing mobility restrictions may have to be limited or delayed until other non-mobility related preventative measures reduce R to a level of approximately 0.7 in Europe, 0.75 in Asia, and 0.8 in the United States. Given gaps in data availability and inference challenges, these estimates should be interpreted with caution.","Bergman, N.

13873,"Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), a novel biomarker to predict the severity of COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis","BackgroundPlatelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), a novel inflammatory marker, has been suggested to be able to predict the severity of COVID-19 patients. This systematic review aims to evaluate the association between PLR levels on admission and the severity of COVID-19 patients.

MethodsA systematic literature search was done on 23 July 2020 to identify peer-reviewed studies across four different databases (Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Library), preprints from two databases (MedRxiv and SSRN), and grey literature from two databases (WHO COVID-19 Global Research Database and Center for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article). Research articles comparing the PLR value on admission in adult patients with COVID-19 with varying degrees of severity were included in the analysis. The following keywords were used for the search: """"COVID-19"""", """"PLR"""", """"severity"""", and """"mortality"""". The inverse variance method was used to calculate the pooled effect standardized mean difference (SMD) along with its 95% confidence interval (CI).

ResultsA total of seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, six of which were conducted in China. From a total of 998 participants included, 316 (31.7%) had severe diseases; and those in the severe group were generally older and had underlying diseases compared to the non-severe group. In comparison to non-severe patients, the meta-analysis showed that severe COVID-19 patients had higher PLR levels on admission (SMD 0.68; 95%CI 0.43-0.93; I2 =58%).

ConclusionHigh PLR levels on admission were associated with severe COVID-19 cases. Therefore, on-admission PLR level is a novel, cost-effective, and readily available biomarker with a promising prognostic role for determining the severity of COVID-19 patients.","Simadibrata, D.

We aimed to evaluate the safety and effects of UVA therapy administered by a novel device via endotracheal tube in critically ill subjects with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsFive newly intubated mechanically ventilated adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an endotracheal tube size 7.5mm or greater, were treated with UVA for 20 minutes daily for 5 days, and followed for 30 days.

ResultsFive subjects were enrolled (mean age 56.6yrs, 3 male). At baseline, all subjects scored 9/10 on the WHO clinical severity scale (10=death) with predicted mortality ranging from 21 to 95%. Average log changes in endotracheal viral load from baseline to day 5 and day 6 were -2.41 (range -1.16 to -4.54; Friedman P=0.002) and -3.20 (range -1.20 to -6.77; Friedman P<0.001), respectively. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events. One subject died 17 days after enrollment due to intracranial hemorrhagic complications of anticoagulation while receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The remaining subjects clinically improved and scored 2, 4, 5, and 7 on the WHO scale at day 30. In these subjects, the slope of viral load reduction during UVA treatment correlated with the slope of improvement in clinical WHO severity score over time (Spearman rho=1, P<0.001).

ConclusionIn this first-in-human study, endotracheal UVA therapy under specific and monitored settings, was safe with a significant reduction in respiratory SARS-CoV-2 viral burden over the treatment period.

These drugs have warning labels for use in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Analysis of whole-genome sequence data of 458 individuals from sub-Saharan Africa showed significant G6PD variation across the continent. We identified nine variants, of which four are potentially deleterious to G6PD function, and one (rs1050828) that is known to cause G6PD deficiency. We supplemented data for the rs1050828 variant with genotype array data from over 11,000 Africans. Although this variant is common in Africans overall, large allele frequency differences exist between sub-populations. African sub-populations in the same country can show significant differences in allele frequency (e.g. 16.0% in Tsonga vs 0.8% in Xhosa, both in South Africa, p = 2.4 x 10-3). The high prevalence of variants in the G6PD gene found in this analysis suggests that it may be a significant interaction factor in clinical trials of chloroquine and hydrochloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 in Africans.","Da Rocha, J.; Othman, H.; Tiemessen, C.

For precise policy making, accurate and efficient forecasts of confirmed cases and death counts are important. In this work, we used five different univariate time series models including; Autoregressive (AR), Moving Average (MA), Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA), Nonparametric Autoregressive (NPAR) and Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) models for forecasting confirmed, death and recovered cases. These models were applied to Pakistan COVID-19 data, covering the period from 10, March to 3, July 2020. To evaluate models accuracy, computed two standard mean errors such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The findings show that the time series models are useful in predicting COVID-19 confirmed, deaths and recovered cases. Furthermore, MA model outperformed the rest of all models for confirmed and deaths counts prediction, while ARMA is second best model. The SES model seems superior to other models for prediction of recovered counts, however MA is competitive. On the basis of best selected models, we forecast form 4th July to 14th August, 2020, which will be helpful for decision making of public health and other sectors of Pakistan.","Iftikhar, H.; Iftikhar, M.",2020-09-22,Health Policy,10.1101/2020.09.20.20198150,1,Hasnain Iftikhar,"Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Pakistan",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.20.20198150v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.20.20198150v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA

7358,Stepping out of lockdown should start with school re-openings while maintaining distancing measures. Insights from mixing matrices and mathematical models.,"Australia is one of a few countries which has managed to control COVID-19 epidemic before a major epidemic took place. Currently with just under 7000 cases and 100 deaths, Australia is seeing less than 20 new cases per day. This is a positive outcome but makes estimation of current effective reproduction numbers difficult to estimate. Australia, like much of the world is poised to step out of lockdown and looking at which measures to relax first.

We use age-based contact matrices, calibrated to Chinese data on reproduction numbers and difference in infectiousness and susceptibility of children to generate next generation matrices (NGMs) for Australia. These matrices have a spectral radius of 2.49, which is hence our estimated basic reproduction number for Australia. The effective reproduction number (Reff) for Australia during the April/May lockdown period is estimated by other means to be around 0.8. We simulate the impact of lockdown on the NGM by first applying observations through Google Mobility Report for Australia at 3 locations: home (increased contacts by 18%), work (reduced contacts by 34%) and other (reduced contacts by 40%), and we reduce schools to 3% reflecting attendance rates during lockdown. Applying macro-distancing to the NGM leads to a spectral radius of 1.76. We estimate that the further reduction of the reproduction number to current levels of Reff = 0.8 is achieved by a micro-distancing factor of 0.26. That is, in a given location, people are 26% as likely as usual to have an effective contact with another person.

We apply both macro and micro-distancing to the NGMs to examine the impact of different exit strategies. We find that reopening schools is estimated to reduce Reff from 0.8 to 0.78. This is because increase in school contact is offset by decrease in home contact. The NGMs all estimate that adults aged 30-50 are responsible for the majority of transmission. We also find that micro-distancing is critically important to maintain Reff <1. There is considerable uncertainty in these estimates and a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is presented.","Mcbryde, E. S.; Trauer, J. M.; Adekunle, A.; Ragonnet, R.; Meehan, M.

18184,Low uptake of COVID-19 prevention behaviours and high socioeconomic impact of lockdown measures in South Asia: evidence from a large-scale multi-country surveillance programme,"BackgroundSouth Asia has become a major epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding South Asians awareness, attitudes and experiences of early measures for the prevention of COVID-19 is key to improving the effectiveness and mitigating the social and economic impacts of pandemic responses at a critical time for the Region.

MethodsWe assessed the knowledge, behaviours, health and socio-economic circumstances of 29,809 adult men and women, at 93 locations across four South Asian countries. Data were collected during the national lockdowns implemented from March to July 2020, and compared with data collected prior to the pandemic as part of an ongoing prospective surveillance initiative.

ResultsParticipants were 61% female, mean age 45.1 years. Almost half had one or more chronic disease, including diabetes (16%), hypertension (23%) or obesity (16%). Knowledge of the primary COVID-19 symptoms and transmission routes was high, but access to hygiene and personal protection resources was low (running water 63%, hand sanitisers 53%, paper tissues 48%). Key preventive measures were not widely adopted. Knowledge, access to, and uptake of COVID-19 prevention measures were low amongst people from disadvantaged socio-economic groups. Fifteen percent of people receiving treatment for chronic diseases reported loss of access to long-term medications; 40% reported symptoms suggestive of anxiety or depression. The prevalence of unemployment rose from 9.3% to 39.4% (P<0.001), and household income fell by 52% (P<0.001) during the lockdown. Younger people and those from less affluent socio-economic groups were most severely impacted. Sedentary time increased by 32% and inadequate fruit and vegetable intake increased by 10% (P<0.001 for both), while tobacco and alcohol consumption dropped by 41% and 80%, respectively (P<0.001), during the lockdown.

ConclusionsOur results identified important knowledge, access and uptake barriers to the prevention of COVID-19 in South Asia, and demonstrated major adverse impacts of the pandemic on chronic disease treatment, mental health, health-related behaviours, employment and household finances. We found important sociodemographic differences for impact, suggesting a widening of existing inequalities. Our findings underscore the need for immediate large-scale action to close gaps in knowledge and access to essential resources for prevention, along with measures to safeguard economic production and mitigate socio-economic impacts on the young and the poor.","Kusuma, D.; Pradeepa, R.; Khawaja, K.

23624,Predictive and Causal Analysis of No-Shows for Medical Exams During COVID-19: A Case Study of Breast Imaging in a Nationwide Israeli Health Organization,"""""No-shows"""", defined as missed appointments or late cancellations, is a central problem in healthcare systems. It has appeared to intensify during the COVID-19 pandemic and the nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as closures, taken to slow its spread. No-shows interfere with patients continuous care, lead to inefficient utilization of medical resources, and increase healthcare costs. We present a comprehensive analysis of no-shows for breast imaging appointments made during 2020 in a large medical network in Israel. We applied advanced machine learning methods to provide insights into novel and known predictors. Additionally, we employed causal inference methodology to infer the effect of closures on no-shows, after accounting for confounding biases, and demonstrate the superiority of adversarial balancing over inverse probability weighting in correcting these biases. Our results imply that a patients perceived risk of cancer and the COVID-19 time-based factors are major predictors. Further, we reveal that closures impact patients over 60, but not patients undergoing advanced diagnostic examinations.","Ozery-Flato, M.; Pinchasov, O.; Dabush-Kasa, M.; Hexter, E.; Chodick, G.; Guindy, M.; Rosen-Zvi, M.",2021-03-13,Health Informatics,10.1101/2021.03.12.21253358,1,Michal Ozery-Flato,IBM Research - Haifa,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.12.21253358v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.12.21253358v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
11945,Providing breastfeeding support during the COVID-19 pandemic: Concerns of mothers who contacted the Australian Breastfeeding Association,"Concerns of mothers seeking breastfeeding support during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the experiences of Australian Breastfeeding Association (ABA) volunteers who assisted them, were explored via an online survey. Surveys were completed 16th March to 18th of May 2020 and described the COVID-19 related concerns of 340 individuals. One hundred and thirty six mothers (64%) sought support to protect their infants by continuing breastfeeding, increasing milk supply, or restarting breastfeeding. Mothers were commonly stressed, isolated and needing reassurance. Thirty four (10%) raised concerns about COVID-19 and breastfeeding safety. One hundred and twenty nine (61%) informed volunteers they were unable to access face-to-face health services because of fear or unavailability. Most common breastfeeding concerns were related to insufficient milk or weight gain, painful breasts, relactation, and reducing supplemental milk. Volunteers reported mothers were worried stress had reduced milk supply, that milk supply concerns were exacerbated by the inability to weigh infants, and that seeking medical treatment was being delayed. ABA volunteers stated they felt supported and confident assisting mothers while also expressing distress at mothers situation. ABAs role in emergency response should be recognised and national planning for infant and young child feeding in emergencies, must be urgently developed, funded, and implemented.","Hull, N.; Kam, R.

11336,Neutralizing Antibody Responses in COVID-19 Convalescent Sera,"Passive transfer of antibodies from COVID-19 convalescent patients is being used as an experimental treatment for eligible patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections. The United States Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) guidelines for convalescent plasma recommends target antibody titers of 160. We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in sera from recovered COVID-19 patients using plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) at low (PRNT50) and high (PRNT90) stringency thresholds. We found that neutralizing activity increased with time post symptom onset (PSO), reaching a peak at 31-35 days PSO. At this point, the number of sera having neutralizing titers of at least 160 was [~]93% (PRNT50) and [~]54% (PRNT90). Sera with high SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels (>960 ELISA titers) showed maximal activity, but not all high titer sera contained neutralizing antibody at FDA recommended levels, particularly at high stringency. These results underscore the value of serum characterization for neutralization activity.","Lee, W. T.; Girardin, R. C.; Dupuis, A. P.; Kulas, K. E.; Payne, A. F.; Wong, S.

19207,Screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic individuals using the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test (Abbott) compared to RT-qPCR,"BackgroundAntigen-based point of care tests for identification of SARS-CoV-2 may markedly enhance effectiveness of population-based controlling strategies. Previous studies have demonstrated acceptable sensitivity and high specificity compared to RT-qPCR in symptomatic individuals, but test performance for asymptomatic individuals is unknown.

MethodsTest performance of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott) was compared to RT-qPCR in a longitudinal cohort study of asymptomatic football players and staff members of professional football clubs. Based on timing of symptoms and prior and subsequent test results, positive RT-qPCR tests were categorized as pre-symptomatic, early or late infection or persistent RNA shedding.

Findings2425 tests were performed in 824 individuals, of which 52 (6.3%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive based on RT-qPCR. There were 2406 paired sets from asymptomatic subjects for analysis. Sixteen Panbio tests were inconclusive, for which sensitivity analyses were performed (considering results as either positive or negative or being excluded). Sensitivity of Panbio ranged from 61.76% (95% CI 49.2-73.3) to 69.12% (95% CI: 56.7-79.8) and specificity from 99.53% (95% CI: 99.2-99.8) to 100% (95% CI: 99.8-100). Sensitivity of Panbio to detect subjects with pre-symptomatic/early infection (n= 42) ranged from 81.82% (95% CI: 67.3-91.8) to 90.91% (95% CI: 78.3-97.5) with specificity always above 99%.

InterpretationIn asymptomatic subjects the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test had sensitivity of 81.82% to 90.91% and specificity above 99% for identifying pre-symptomatic and early SARS-CoV-2 infection.

7244,A novel COVID-19 epidemiological model with explicit susceptible and asymptomatic isolation compartments reveals unexpected consequences of timing social distancing,"Motivated by the current COVID-19 epidemic, this work introduces an epidemiological model in which separate compartments are used for susceptible and asymptomatic """"socially distant"""" populations. Distancing directives are represented by rates of flow into these compartments, as well as by a reduction in contacts that lessens disease transmission. The dynamical behavior of this system is analyzed, under various different rate control strategies, and the sensitivity of the basic reproduction number to various parameters is studied. One of the striking features of this model is the existence of a critical implementation delay (""""CID"""") in issuing separation mandates: while a delay of about two weeks does not have an appreciable effect on the peak number of infections, issuing mandates even slightly after this critical time results in a far greater incidence of infection. Thus, there is a nontrivial but tight """"window of opportunity"""" for commencing social distancing in order to meet the capacity of healthcare resources. However, if one wants to also delay the timing of peak infections -so as to take advantage of potential new therapies and vaccines- action must be taken much faster than the CID. Different relaxation strategies are also simulated, with surprising results. Periodic relaxation policies suggest a schedule which may significantly inhibit peak infective load, but that this schedule is very sensitive to parameter values and the schedules frequency. Furthermore, we considered the impact of steadily reducing social distancing measures over time. We find that a too-sudden reopening of society may negate the progress achieved under initial distancing guidelines, but the negative effects can be mitigated if the relaxation strategy is carefully designed.","Gevertz, J.; Greene, J.; Hixahuary Sanchez Tapia, C.; Sontag, E.

10125,Estimating and explaining the spread of COVID-19 at the county level in the USA,"The basic reproduction number, R0, determines the rate of spread of a communicable disease and therefore gives fundamental information needed to plan public health interventions. Estimated R0 values are only useful, however, if they accurately predict the future potential rate of spread. Using mortality records, we estimated the rate of spread of COVID-19 among 160 counties and county-aggregates in the USA. Most of the high among-county variance in the rate of spread was explained by four factors: the timing of the county-level outbreak (partial R2 = 0.093), population size (partial R2 = 0.34), population density (partial R2 = 0.13), and spatial location (partial R2 = 0.42). Of these, the effect of timing is explained by early steps that people and governments took to reduce transmission, and population size is explained by the sample size of deaths that affects the statistical ability to estimate R0. For predictions of future spread, population density is important, likely because it scales the average contact rate among people. To generate support for a possible explanation for the importance of spatial location, we show that SARS-CoV-2 strains containing the G614 mutation to the spike gene are associated with higher rates of spread (P = 0.016). The high predictability of R0 based on population density and spatial location allowed us to extend estimates to all 3109 counties in the lower 48 States. The high variation of R0 among counties argues for public health policies that are enacted at the county level for controlling COVID-19.","Ives, A.

11837,Are we ready when COVID-19 vaccine is available? Study on nurses' vaccine hesitancy in Hong Kong,"IntroductionNurses are considered a trustworthy source of vaccine-related information to build public confidence in vaccination. This study estimated nurses influenza vaccine uptake and intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine when available, and examined the corresponding psychological antecedents.

MethodsA cross-sectional online survey among nurses was conducted during the main COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong between mid-March and late April 2020. Demographics, influenza vaccination, intention to have COVID-19 vaccine, the 5C vaccine hesitancy components (i.e., confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility), work stress and COVID-related work demands (i.e., insufficient supply of personal protective equipment, involvement in isolation rooms, and unfavorable attitudes towards workplace infection control policies) were reported.

ResultsThe influenza vaccination coverage and the proportion intending to take COVID-19 vaccine were 49% and 63%, respectively, among 1205 eligible nurses. Influenza vaccine uptake was associated with working in public hospitals and all 5C constructs, whereas stronger COVID-19 vaccination intention was associated with younger age, more confidence, less complacency and more collective responsibility towards the vaccine. COVID-19-related demands were associated with greater work stress, and hence stronger COVID-19 vaccination intention.

ConclusionVaccine uptake/intention was well predicted by the 5C constructs. With less work stress among nurses in the post-pandemic period, the intention to take COVID-19 vaccine will likely drop. The 5C constructs should be infused in vaccination campaigns. While a COVID-19 vaccine could be ready soon, communities are not ready to accept it. More research work is needed to boost the uptake.","Kwok, K. O.; Li, K. K.; Wei, W. I.; Tang, K. H.; Wong, S. Y. S.; Lee, S.

Of these, 300 were enrolled prior to, and 110 after, the initial detection and replacement of wild-type by the B.1.351 variant. All participants provided a supervised self-collected mid-turbinate (MT) and saliva (SA) swab, in addition to the standard HCW collected NP swab which were all tested by RT-PCR in an accredited diagnostic laboratory. Positive percent agreement to NP swab for SA swabs pre- and post-variant were 51.5% and 72.5% respectively while these values for MT swabs were 75.8% and 77.5%. The negative percent agreement for all swab types during all periods was >98%. The basis for this marked improvement of SA swabs as a diagnostic sample for B.1.351 virus is still being investigated.","Chu, C.

2059,"Public Exposure to Live Animals, Behavioural Change, and Support in Containment Measures in response to COVID-19 Outbreak: a population-based cross sectional survey in China","BackgroundIn response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we aimed to investigate behavioural change on exposure to live animals before and during the outbreak, and public support and confidence for governmental containment measures.

MethodsA population-based cross-sectional telephone survey via random dialing was conducted in Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases) between 1 and 10 February, 2020. 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai were randomly sampled. Differences of outcome measures were compared before and during the outbreak, and between two cities.

FindingsProportion of respondents visiting wet markets at usual was 23.3% (119/510) in Wuhan and 20.4% (102/501) in Shanghai. During the outbreak, it decreased to 3.1% (16) in Wuhan (p<0{middle dot}001), and 4.4% (22) in Shanghai (p<0{middle dot}001). Proportion of those consuming wild animal products declined from 10.2% (52) to 0.6% (3) in Wuhan (p<0{middle dot}001), and from 5.2% (26) to 0.8% (4) in Shanghai (p<0{middle dot}001). 79.0% (403) of respondents in Wuhan and 66.9% (335) of respondents in Shanghai supported permanent closure of wet markets (P<0.001). 95% and 92% of respondents supported banning wild animal trade and quarantining Wuhan, and 75% were confident towards containment measures. Females and the more educated were more supportive for the above containment measures.

InterpretationThe public responded quickly to the outbreak, and reduced exposure to live animals, especially in Wuhan. With high public support in containment measures, better regulation of wet markets and healthy diets should be promoted.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSOn February 19, 2020, we searched PubMed for papers published after January 1, 2020, containing the following terms: """"2019 nCoV"""" or """"COVID-19"""". We identified 179 studies, most of which are research on clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. To date there is no primary research to quantify public behavioural response and support in containment measures in response to the outbreak. Only four commentaries mentioned the influence of the outbreak on mental health. One commentary introduced the habit of consuming wild animal products in China. Another commentary briefly introduced isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment as public health measures in the outbreak. The Chinese government has introduced a series of strict containment measures, and societal acceptability of these measure is important for effective and sustained response. Evidence is urgently needed to help policy makers understand public response to the outbreak and support for the containment measures, but no evidence available to date.

Added value of this studyWe conducted a population-based cross-sectional telephone survey via random digital dialing in Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases) between 1 and 10 February, 2020. To date, this is the only few analyses on behavioural response to the outbreak and societal acceptability of governmental containment measures, which has been listed as the current priority of China CDC. We provide an assessment of behavioural change on exposure to live animals during the outbreak, by comparison before and during the outbreak, and between two cities with diverse exposure intensities to COVID-19. We also provide evidence on public support in governmental containment measures, including strict regulation on wet markets to reduce animal-to-human transmission and city quarantine to reduce human transmission.

Implications of all the available evidenceWe found that wild animal consumption was more prevalent in Wuhan (10.2%) than in Shanghai (5.2%). The public responded quickly to the outbreak, and significantly reduced exposure to live animals and stopped wild animal consumption, especially in Wuhan. They were very supportive of governmental containment measures.

7868,Acute Pulmonary Embolism in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19,"Since the discovery of the novel coronavirus (SARS-Co-V-2) in December 2019, multiple characteristics have been reported, as our understanding of this new disease unfolds. One such association is its tendency to cause thromboembolic events, particularly venous thromboembolism1,2. In a four-week period during the initial spread of COVID-19 at a 300 bed community hospital in western Massachusetts, 23 patients who were PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA required treatment in either the intensive care unit (ICU) or intermediate/step-down unit (SDU). All patients were treated with standard DVT prophylaxis from the time of admission, except for two patients who were on full anticoagulation for chronic atrial fibrillation. Of the 23 patients, 7 (30%) were diagnosed with acute, clinically significant, pulmonary embolism (PE). Four of the 7 manifested evidence of acute cor pulmonale, one of whom succumbed as a direct consequence of a massive PE. Other markers were reviewed in the 7 patients to identify trends that could allow for early suspicion of PE in COVID-19 patients. Although D-dimer tended to rise during the hospitalization relative to the control group, the results were inconsistent, and there were no other meaningful distinguishing features between the groups at the time of admission.","Manjunath, M.; Miranda, J.; Fraenkel, L.; Johansen, P.

16349,Role of high-dose exposure in transmission hot zones as a driver of SARS-CoV2 dynamics,"Epidemiological data on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the absence and presence of various non-pharmaceutical interventions indicate that the virus is not transmitted uniformly in the population. Transmission tends to be more effective in select settings that involve exposure to relatively high viral dose, such as in crowded indoor settings, assisted living facilities, prisons, or food processing plants. To explore the effect on infection dynamics, we describe a new mathematical model where transmission can occur (i) in the community at large, characterized by low dose exposure and mostly mild disease, and (ii) in so called transmission hot zones, characterized by high dose exposure that can be associated with more severe disease. Interestingly, we find that successful infection spread can hinge upon high-dose hot zone transmission, yet the majority of infections are predicted to occur in the community at large with mild disease. This gives rise to the prediction that targeted interventions that specifically reduce virus transmission in the hot zones (but not in the community at large) have the potential to suppress overall infection spread, including in the community at large. The model can further reconcile seemingly contradicting epidemiological observations. While in some locations like California, strict stay-home orders failed to significantly reduce infection prevalence, in other locations, such as New York and several European countries, stay-home orders lead to a pronounced fall in infection levels, which remained suppressed for some months after re-opening of society. Differences in hot zone transmission levels during and after social distancing interventions can account for these diverging infection patterns. These modeling results warrant further epidemiological investigations into the role of high dose hot zone transmission for the maintenance of SARS-CoV-2 spread.","Wodarz, D.; Komarova, N.

21050,"Emergence of a novel SARS-CoV-2 strain in Southern California, USA","Since October 2020, novel strains of SARS-CoV-2 including B.1.1.7, have been identified to be of global significance from an infection and surveillance perspective. While this strain (B.1.1.7) may play an important role in increased COVID rates in the UK, there are still no reported strains to account for the spike of cases in Los Angeles (LA) and California as a whole, which currently has some of the highest absolute and per-capita COVID transmission rates in the country. From the early days of the pandemic when LA only had a single viral genome uploaded onto GISAID we have been at the forefront of generating and analyzing the SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data from the LA region. We report a novel strain emerging in Southern California. Most current cases in the catchment population in LA fall into two distinct subclades: 1) 20G (24% of total) is the predominant subclade currently in the United States 2) a relatively novel strain in clade 20C, CAL.20C strain ([~]36% of total) is defined by five concurrent mutations. After an analysis of all of the publicly available data and a comparison to our recent sequences, we see a dramatic growth in the relative percentage of the CAL.20C strain beginning in November of 2020. The predominance of this strain coincides with the increased positivity rate seen in this region. Unlike 20G, this novel strain CAL.20C is defined by multiple mutations in the S protein, a characteristic it shares with both the UK and South African strains, both of which are of significant clinical and scientific interest","Zhang, W.; Davis, B.; Chen, S.

7021,Pre-existing Cardiovascular Disease in United States Population at High Risk for Severe COVID-19 Infection,"Article abstractO_ST_ABSBackground and PurposeC_ST_ABSThere is increasing recognition of a relatively high burden of pre-existing cardiovascular disease in Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected patients. We determined the burden of pre-existing cardiovascular disease in persons residing in United States (US) who are at risk for severe COVID-19 infection.

MethodsAge ([&ge;]60 years), presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, mellitus, hypertension, and/or malignancy were used to identify persons at risk for admission to intensive care unit, or invasive ventilation, or death with COVID-19 infection. Persons were classified as low risk (no risk factors), moderate risk (1 risk factor), and high risk (two or more risk factors present) using nationally representative sample of US adults from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2017-2018 survey.

ResultsAmong a total of 5856 participants, 2386 (40.7%) were considered low risk, 1325 (22.6%) moderate risk, and 2145 persons (36.6%) as high risk for severe COVID-19 infection. The proportion of patients who had pre-existing stroke increased from 0.6% to 10.5% in low risk patients to high risk patients (odds ratio [OR]19.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]11.6-34.3). The proportion of who had pre-existing myocardial infection (MI) increased from 0.4% to 10.4% in low risk patients to high risk patients (OR 30.6, 95% CI 15.7-59.8).

ConclusionsA large proportion of persons in US who are at risk for developing severe COVID-19 infection are expected to have pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Further studies need to identify whether targeted strategies towards cardiovascular diseases can reduce the mortality in COVID-19 infected patients.","Qureshi, A.

15494,A Brief Burnout Evaluation Scale (BBES) as a potential tool to prevent collapse of the health care task force during the COVID-19 pandemic,"IntroductionIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where overloaded health systems seem inevitable, there is a need for reliable, conceptually adequate, and easily applied measurement tools to identify health professionals at risk.

Objectiveto present the preliminary psychometric properties of a Brief Burnout Evaluation Scale (BBES) and its association with important outcomes, i.e., moderate to severe depression and suicidal ideation.

MethodsThe BBES has 4 Likert-type items and was tested as part of a cross-sectional study that included 401 medical students. Reliability analysis and validity studies were performed.

ResultsIn the parallel analysis, two factors were extracted, explaining 84.4% of the variance. The Cronbachs alpha was 0.78, showing high internal consistency. Considering a cut-off point of 12, the odds ratio for moderate to severe depression was 3.01 (CI 1.7-5.22; p<0.001) and for last month suicidal ideation 2.96 (CI 1.6-5.48).

ConclusionThe results suggest good psychometric characteristics for the BBES, thus reinforcing its utility as an assessment tool for evaluating the well-being or distress of health professionals. It carries with it the potential to implement early interventions and to prevent the descent into burnout so common today in the health care task force during the pandemic.","Bastos, T.

We include the timing of each states implementation of interventions including encouraging social distancing, closing schools, banning public events, and a lockdown / stay-at-home order. We assume fatalities are reported correctly and infer the number and timing of infections based on the infection fatality rate measured in populations that were tested universally for SARS-CoV-2. Underreporting of deaths would drive our estimates to be too low. Reporting of deaths on the wrong day could drive errors in either direction.

23065,An overview of the National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database: data quality and cohort analysis,"The National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database (NCCID) is a centralised database containing chest X-rays, chest Computed Tomography (CT) scans and cardiac Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) from patients across the UK, jointly established by NHSX, the British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI), Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust (RSNFT) and Faculty. The objective of the initiative is to support a better understanding of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) and development of machine learning (ML) technologies that will improve care for patients hospitalised with a severe COVID-19 infection. The NCCID is now accumulating data from 20 NHS Trusts and Health Boards across England and Wales, with a total contribution of approximately 25,000 imaging studies in the training set (at time of writing) and is actively being used as a research tool by several organisations. This paper introduces the training dataset, including a snapshot analysis performed by NHSX covering: the completeness of clinical data, the availability of image data for the various use-cases (diagnosis, prognosis and longitudinal risk) and potential model confounders within the imaging data. The aim is to inform both existing and potential data users of the NCCIDs suitability for developing diagnostic/prognostic models. In addition, a cohort analysis was performed to measure the representativeness of the NCCID to the wider COVID-19 affected population. Three major aspects were included: geographic, demographic and temporal coverage, revealing good alignment in some categories, e.g., sex and identifying areas for improvements to data collection methods, particularly with respect to geographic coverage.

Methods and findingsUsing data from national reporting of SARS-CoV-2 tested individuals, we estimated odds of hospitalization, intubation and death based on pre-existing non-communicable diseases and socioeconomic indicators. We found that obesity, diabetes and hypertension are positively associated with the 3 outcomes in a synergistic manner. The municipal poverty level is also positively associated with hospitalization and death.

ConclusionsMexicos response to COVID-19 is complicated by a synergistic double challenge: raging NCDs and extreme social inequity.

9977,The Endothelial Dysfunction and Pyroptosis Might Drive the SARS-CoV-2 Lung Injury to the Systemic Immunothrombosis,"ObjectiveEndothelial cells that are close to the alveolar-capillary exchange membranes can be activated by SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to cytokine release and macrophage activation syndrome. This could trigger endothelial dysfunction, pyroptosis, and immunothrombosis, which are the vascular changes commonly referred to as COVID-19 endotheliopathy. Thus, this study aimed to identify tissue biomarkers associated with endothelial activation/dysfunction and the pyroptosis pathway in the lung and myocardial samples of COVID-19 patients and to compare them to pandemic Influenza A virus H1N1 subtype - 2009 and Control cases.

Approach and ResultsPost-mortem lung (COVID-19 group=6 cases; H1N1 group=10 cases, and Control group=11 cases) and myocardial samples (COVID-19=2 cases and control=1 case) were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and the following monoclonal primary antibodies: anti-CD163, anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6), anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), anti-intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and anti-caspase-1. From the result, IL-6, TNF-alpha, ICAM-1, and caspase-1 showed higher tissue expression in the COVID-19 group than in the H1N1 and control groups.

ConclusionOur results demonstrated the presence of endotheliopathy and suggest the participation of the pyroptosis pathway in both the pulmonary and myocardial samples. These conditions might lead to systemic immunothrombotic events that could impair the efforts of clinical staff to avoid fatal outcomes. One of the goals of health professionals should be to identify the high-risk of immunothrombosis patients early to block endotheliopathy and its consequences.","Nagashima, S.; Mendes, M.

18301,Wastewater-based Epidemiology for Averting COVID-19 Outbreaks on The University of Arizona Campus,"The University of Arizona utilized wastewater-based epidemiology paired with clinical testing as a surveillance strategy to monitor COVID-19 prevalence in a dormitory community. Positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in wastewater led to prompt testing of all residents and the identification and isolation of three infected individuals which averted potential disease transmission.

TextWastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) utilizes concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage to monitor population-level COVID-19 infections (1-3). Currently, WBE is a promising indicator to support public health decisions (3,4). In this case study, WBE was used to detect a COVID-19 outbreak in a student dormitory (henceforth Dorm A) at the University of Arizona (UArizona).

The StudyUArizona incorporated wastewater surveillance as a potential early-warning tool for COVID-19 outbreaks on campus. Grab samples (1L) were collected from a sewer manhole specific to Dorm A, between August 18-31 to monitor SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. Upon positive detection of viral RNA in wastewater samples, clinical testing was conducted on every individual living in the dorm. UArizona performed two clinical testing modalities, antigen (1 hour turnaround) test via anterior nasal swab and RT-PCR (48-72 hour turnaround) via nasopharyngeal swab samples. Individuals were subject to clinical testing via two routes: Campus Health Services (CHS) if experiencing symptoms or Test All Test Smart (TATS) regardless of symptoms.

8457,Association of Poor Housing Conditions with COVID-19 Incidence and Mortality Across US Counties,"ObjectivePoor housing conditions have been linked with worse health outcomes and infectious spread in communities but its relationship with incidence and mortality of COVID-19 is unknown. Therefore, we undertook this study to determine the association between poor housing condition and COVID-19 incidence and mortality in US counties.

MethodsWe conducted cross-sectional analysis of county-level data from the US Centers for Disease Control, US Census Bureau and John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center for 3141 US counties. The exposure of interest was percentage of households with poor housing conditions (one or more of: overcrowding, high housing cost, incomplete kitchen facilities, or incomplete plumbing facilities). Outcomes were incidence rate ratios (IRR) and mortality rate ratios (MRR) of COVID-19 across US counties through 4/21/2020. Multilevel generalized linear modeling was utilized with adjustment for population density and county characteristics including demographics, income, education, prevalence of medical comorbidities, access to healthcare insurance and emergency rooms, and state-level COVID-19 test density.

ResultsAcross 3135 US counties, the mean percentage of households with poor housing conditions was 14.2% (range 2.7% to 60.2%). The mean (SD) incidence and mortality of COVID-19 were 255.68 (2877.03) cases and 13.90 (272.22) deaths per county, respectively. In the fully adjusted models, with each 5% increase in percent households with poor housing conditions, there was a 50% higher risk of COVID-19 incidence (IRR 1.50, 95% CI: 1.38 - 1.62) and a 42% higher risk of COVID-19 mortality (MRR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.25 - 1.61). Results remained similar using earlier timepoints (3/31/2020 and 4/10/2020).

Conclusions and RelevanceCounties with a higher percentage of households with poor housing had higher incidence of, and mortality associated with, COVID-19. These findings suggest targeted health policies to support individuals living in poor housing conditions should be considered in further efforts to mitigate adverse outcomes associated with COVID-19.","Ahmad, K.; Erqou, S.; Shah, N.; Nazir, U.; Morrison, A.; Choudhary, G.; Wu, W.-C.",2020-05-30,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.28.20116087,1,Wen-Chih Wu,Brown University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.20116087v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.20116087v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1371/journal.pone.0241327
9067,Understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being and virtual care for people living with dementia and care partners living in the community,"The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated public health measures that have impacted the provision of care for people living with dementia and their families. Additionally, the isolation that results from social distancing may be harming well-being for families, as formal and informal supports become less accessible. For those with living with dementia and experiencing agitation, social distancing may be even harder to maintain, or social distancing could potentially aggravate dementia-related neuropsychiatric symptoms. To understand the lived experience of social and physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada we remotely interviewed 21 participants who normally attend a dementia specialty clinic in Calgary, Alberta, during a period where essential businesses were closed and healthcare had abruptly transitioned to telemedicine. The impacts of the public health measures in response to the pandemic emerged in three main categories of experience: 1) personal; 2) health services; and 3) health status (of both person living with dementia and care partner). This in-depth understanding of the needs and experiences of the pandemic for people living with dementia suggests that innovative means are urgently needed to facilitate provision of remote medicine and also social interaction and integration.","Roach, P.; Zwiers, A.; Cox, E.; Fischer, K.; Charlton, A.; Josephson, C.

17679,Cell phone mobility data and manifold learning: Insights into population behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic,"As COVID-19 cases resurge in the United States, understanding the complex interplay between human behavior, disease transmission, and non-pharmaceutical interventions during the pandemic could provide valuable insights to focus future public health efforts. Cell-phone mobility data offers a modern measurement instrument to investigate human mobility and behavior at an unprecedented scale. We investigate mobility data collected, aggregated, and anonymized by SafeGraph Inc. which measures how populations at the census-block-group geographic scale stayed at home in California, Georgia, Texas, and Washington since the beginning of the pandemic. Using manifold learning techniques, we find patterns of mobility behavior that align with stay-at-home orders, correlate with socioeconomic factors, cluster geographically, and reveal sub-populations that likely migrated out of urban areas. The analysis and approach provides policy makers a framework for interpreting mobility data and behavior to inform actions aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19.","Levin, R.; Chao, D.

14937,Spatial and temporal trends in social vulnerability and COVID-19 incidence and death rates in the United States,"BackgroundEmerging evidence suggests that socially vulnerable communities are at higher risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks in the United States. However, no prior studies have examined temporal trends and differential effects of social vulnerability on COVID-19 incidence and death rates. The purpose of this study was to examine temporal trends among counties with high and low social vulnerability and to quantify disparities in these trends over time. We hypothesized that highly vulnerable counties would have higher incidence and death rates compared to less vulnerable counties and that this disparity would widen as the pandemic progressed.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective longitudinal analysis examining COVID-19 incidence and death rates from March 1 to August 31, 2020 for each county in the US. We obtained daily COVID-19 incident case and death data from USAFacts and the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering. We classified counties using the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a percentile-based measure from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in which higher scores represent more vulnerability. Using a Bayesian hierarchical negative binomial model, we estimated daily risk ratios (RRs) comparing counties in the first (lower) and fourth (upper) SVI quartiles. We adjusted for percentage of the county designated as rural, percentage in poor or fair health, percentage of adult smokers, county average daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5), percentage of primary care physicians per 100,000 residents, and the proportion tested for COVID-19 in the state.

ResultsIn unadjusted analyses, we found that for most of March 2020, counties in the upper SVI quartile had significantly fewer cases per 100,000 than lower SVI quartile counties. However, on March 30, we observed a """"crossover effect"""" in which the RR became significantly greater than 1.00 (RR = 1.10, 95% PI: 1.03, 1.18), indicating that the most vulnerable counties had, on average, higher COVID-19 incidence rates compared to least vulnerable counties. Upper SVI quartile counties had higher death rates on average starting on March 30 (RR = 1.17, 95% PI: 1.01,1.36). The death rate RR achieved a maximum value on July 29 (RR = 3.22, 95% PI: 2.91, 3.58), indicating that most vulnerable counties had, on average, 3.22 times more deaths per million than the least vulnerable counties. However, by late August, the lower quartile started to catch up to the upper quartile. In adjusted models, the RRs were attenuated for both incidence cases and deaths, indicating that the adjustment variables partially explained the associations. We also found positive associations between COVID-19 cases and deaths and percentage of the county designated as rural, percentage of resident in fair or poor health, and average daily PM2.5.

ConclusionsResults indicate that the impact of COVID-19 is not static but can migrate from less vulnerable counties to more vulnerable counties over time. This highlights the importance of protecting vulnerable populations as the pandemic unfolds.","Neelon, B.; Mutiso, F.; Mueller, N. T.; Pearce, J. L.; Benjamin-Neelon, S.

18312,Nasopharyngeal Panbio COVID-19 antigen performed at point-of-care has a high sensitivity in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with higher risk for transmission and older age,"BackgroundPerformance of point-of-care tests in clinical practice remains undetermined. We aimed to evaluate the performance of the nasopharyngeal Panbio COVID-19 antigen Rapid Test Device in real-life conditions in different clinical scenarios.

MethodProspective study conducted in three primary care centers (PCC) and an emergency department. The antigen test was performed at point-of-care in nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs, and in saliva. Positive and negative percent agreement (PPA, NPA) were calculated with the RT-PCR assay as reference standard.

ResultsOf 913 patients included, 296 (32.3%) were asymptomatic and 690 (75.6%) came from the PCC. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 913, nasal swabs from 659, and saliva from 611 patients. RT-PCR was positive in 196 (21.5%) nasopharyngeal samples (NPS). Overall PPA (95% CI) in NPS was 60.5% (53.3-67.4), and it was lower in nasal swabs (44.7%) and saliva (23.1%). Test performance in NPS was largely dependent on the cycle threshold (Ct) in RT-PCR, with PPA>90% for Ct[&le;]25 and [&ge;]80% for Ct<30. In symptomatic patients, the PPA was 95% for Ct[&le;]25; [&ge;]85% for Ct<30, and 89% for the symptom triad of fever, cough and malaise. Performance was also dependent on age, with PPA of 100% in symptomatic patients >50 years with Ct<25. In asymptomatic patients, the PPA was 86% for Ct<25. In all cases, NPA was 100%.

ConclusionThe nasopharyngeal Panbio COVID-19 antigen test performed at point-of-care is highly sensitive in symptomatic patients, particularly with Ct<30 and older age. The test was useful to identify asymptomatic patients with lower Ct values and therefore with contagious risk.

Key pointsThe nasopharyngeal Panbio-COVID-19 antigen test performed in real-life conditions at point-of-care is highly sensitive in symptomatic patients, particularly with Ct<30 and older age.

21908,SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses are lower in children and increase with age and time after infection,"SARS-CoV-2 infection of children leads to a mild illness and the immunological differences with adults remains unclear. We quantified the SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses in adults and children (<13 years of age) with RT-PCR confirmed asymptomatic and symptomatic infection for long-term memory, phenotype and polyfunctional cytokines. Acute and memory CD4+ T cell responses to structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins significantly increased with age, whilst CD8+ T cell responses increased with time post infection. Infected children had significantly lower CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 structural and ORF1ab proteins compared to infected adults. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses were comparable in magnitude to uninfected negative adult controls. In infected adults CD4+ T cell specificity was skewed towards structural peptides, whilst children had increased contribution of ORF1ab responses. This may reflect differing T cell compartmentalisation for antigen processing during antigen exposure or lower recruitment of memory populations. T cell polyfunctional cytokine production was comparable between children and adults, but children had a lower proportion of SARS-CoV-2 CD4+ T cell effector memory. Compared to adults, children had significantly lower levels of antibodies to {beta}-coronaviruses, indicating differing baseline immunity. Total T follicular helper responses was increased in children during acute infection indicating rapid co-ordination of the T and B cell responses. However total monocyte responses were reduced in children which may be reflective of differing levels of inflammation between children and adults. Therefore, reduced prior {beta}-coronavirus immunity and reduced activation and recruitment of de novo responses in children may drive milder COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Cohen, C. A.; Li, A.

8818,Evaluation of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2: Implications for serology testing in a low-prevalence setting,"BackgroundRobust serological assays are essential for long-term control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many recently released point-of-care (PoCT) serological assays have been distributed with little pre-market validation.

MethodsPerformance characteristics for five PoCT lateral flow devices approved for use in Australia were compared to a commercial enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) and a recently described novel surrogate virus neutralisation test (sVNT).

ResultsSensitivities for PoCT ranged from 51.8% (95% CI 43.1 to 60.4%) to 67.9% (95% CI 59.4-75.6%), and specificities from 95.6% (95% CI 89.2-98.8%) to 100.0% (95% CI 96.1-100.0%). Overall ELISA sensitivity for either IgA or IgG detection was 67.9% (95% CI 59.4-75.6), increasing to 93.8% (95% CI 85.0-98.3%) for samples > 14 days post symptom onset. Overall, sVNT sensitivity was 60.9% (95% CI 53.2-68.4%), rising to 91.2%% (95% CI 81.8-96.7%) for samples collected > 14 days post-symptom onset, with a specificity 94.4% (95% CI 89.2-97.5%),

ConclusionPerformance characteristics for COVID-19 serological assays were generally lower than those reported by manufacturers. Timing of specimen collection relative to onset of illness or infection is crucial in the reporting of performance characteristics for COVID-19 serological assays. The optimal algorithm for implementing serological testing for COVID-19 remains to be determined, particularly in low-prevalence settings.","Bond, K.; Nicholson, S.; Lim, S.; Karapanagiotidis, T.; Williams, E.; Johnston, D.; Hoang, T.; Sia, C.; Purcell, D.; Lewin, S.; Catton, M.; Howden, B.

19649,Predicting the Peak and COVID-19 trend in six high incidence countries: A study based on Modified SEIRD model,"The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has claimed the lives of almost a million people across the globe and this trend continues to rise rapidly day by day. The fear of getting infected by Corona virus is affecting the people emotionally, psychologically and mentally. They are not able to work to their full capacity and are also worried about the well beings of their near and dear ones. The National governments have taken up several measures like lockdowns, closing of educational institutions, and work from home for employees of companies wherever feasible. Governments are also advising people to take precautions like not to go out if not necessary, use of mask and keep a distance of appx. 6 ft. if you need to go out as the virus spreads from human to human in close proximity. These measures have helped to limit the spread of this virus in the past few months. However, due to rapid increase in the daily confirmed cases, it is becoming tougher for the governments to provide facilities like testing kits, hospitalization facilities, oxygen cylinders etc. to the infected persons. Thus, there is an urgent need to accurately estimate the number of cases in coming future that can help governments in acquiring the required resources. Further, to handle the economic distress caused by this virus, long-term planning is equally important. Focusing on these two aspects, this paper proposes to use the Modified SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Deceased) model to predict the peak and spread trend of COVID-19 in six countries namely USA, India, Brazil, Russia, Peru and Colombia having the highest number of confirmed cases. As in COVID-19, even infected asymptomatic persons can spread the infection, the chosen model is well suited as exposed compartment of SEIRD model includes asymptomatic exposed individuals which are infectious. Epidemiological data till 9th September 2020 has been utilised to perform short-term predictions till 31st December 2020. Long-term predictions have been computed till 31st December 2023, to estimate the end of the virus in the above-mentioned six nations. Small values of MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) have been obtained for the models fitted to reported data for all the countries. Student t-test has been used for accepting the predictions of the Modified SEIRD model based on the reported data.","Bedi, P. P.; Dhiman, M. S.; Gupta, M. N.; Jindal, D. V.; Gole, M.

5291,Clinical evaluation of an immunochromatographic IgM/IgG antibody assay and chest computed tomography for the diagnosis of COVID-19,"BackgroundWe evaluated the clinical performance of an immunochromatographic (IC) IgM/IgG antibody assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) and chest computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

MethodsWe examined 139 serum specimens collected from 112 patients with COVID-19 and 48 serum specimens collected from 48 non-COVID-19 patients. The presence of IgM/IgG antibody for SARS-CoV2 was determined using the One Step Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG Antibody Test. Chest CT was performed in COVID-19 patients on admission.

FindingsOf the139 COVID-19 serum specimens, IgM was detected in 27.8%, 48.0%, and 95.8% of the specimens collected within 1 week, 1-2 weeks, and >2 weeks after symptom onset and IgG was detected in 3.3%, 8.0%, and 62.5%, respectively. Among the 48 non-COVID-19 serum specimens, 1 generated a false-positive result for IgM. Thirty-eight of the 112 COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, of whom 15 were positive for IgM, and 74 were symptomatic, of whom 22 were positive for IgM and 7 were positive for IgG. The diagnostic sensitivity of CT scan alone and in combination with the IC assay was 57.9 % (22/38) and 68.4% (26/38) for the asymptomatic patients and 74.3% (55/74) and 82.4% (61/74) for the symptomatic patients, respectively.

ConclusionThe IC assay had low sensitivity during the early phase of infection, and thus IC assay alone is not recommended for initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19. If RT-qPCR is not available, the combination of chest CT and IC assay may be useful for diagnosing COVID-19.","Imai, K.; Tabata, S.; Ikeda, M.; Noguchi, S.; Kitagawa, Y.; Matuoka, M.; Miyoshi, K.; Tarumoto, N.; Sakai, J.; Ito, T.; Maesaki, S.; Tamura, K.; Maeda, T.",2020-04-27,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.22.20075564,1,Kazuo Imai,Saitama Medical University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20075564v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20075564v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104393
23664,Monitoring the rise of the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 in Tenerife (Spain) since mid-December 2020,"Starting in December 2020, a sharp increase of COVID-19 cases occurred in Tenerife compared to the rest of the Canary Islands (Spain). Because of the direct touristic connections between Tenerife and the UK, and the rapid transmission and dominance of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant of concern (VOC-202012/01) by the end of November 2020 in South England, here we measured the proportion of B.1.1.7 cases occurring between the 18th of December 2020 and the 25th of February 2021. Out of the 2,091 COVID-19 positive nasopharyngeal swab samples assessed, 226 showed a spike gene target failure (SGTF). Subsequent viral genome sequencing further confirmed that 93.2% of them corresponded to the B.1.1.7 lineage. Furthermore, a rapid increase in the proportion of SGTF variants was detected in up to 10.7% of positive cases during the Christmas season despite stricter measures for containing the transmission were imposed in Tenerife in the period. These results support the local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage in Tenerife since late December 2020 although it is not yet dominant.","Alcoba-Florez, J.; Lorenzo-Salazar, J.

6262,"Effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on Maternal, Perinatal and Neonatal Outcomes: a Systematic Review of 266 Pregnancies","ObjectiveTo perform a systematic review of available published literature on pregnancies affected by COVID-19 to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes.

MethodsWe performed a systematic review to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy, perinatal and neonatal outcomes. We conducted a comprehensive literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database and Wan Fang Data until April 20, 2020 (studies were identified through PubMed alert after April 20, 2020). For the research strategy, combinations of the following keywords and MeSH terms were used: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019, pregnancy, gestation, maternal, mothers, vertical transmission, maternal-fetal transmission, intrauterine transmission, neonates, infant, delivery. Eligibility criteria included laboratory-confirmed and/or clinically diagnosed COVID-19, patient was pregnant on admission, availability of clinical characteristics, including maternal, perinatal or neonatal outcomes. Exclusion criteria were unpublished reports, unspecified date and location of the study or suspicion of duplicate reporting, and unreported maternal or perinatal outcomes. No language restrictions were applied.

ResultsWe identified several case-reports and case-series but only 19 studies, including a total of 266 pregnant women with COVID-19, met eligibility criteria and were finally included in the review. In the combined data from seven case-series, the maternal age ranged from 20 to 41 years and the gestational age on admission ranged from 5 to 41 weeks. The most common symptoms at presentation were fever, cough, dyspnea/shortness of breath and fatigue. The rate of severe pneumonia was relatively low, with the majority of the cases requiring intensive care unit admission. Almost all cases from the case-series had positive computer tomography chest findings. There were six and 22 cases that had nucleic-acid testing in vaginal mucus and breast milk samples, respectively, which were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Only a few cases had spontaneous miscarriage or abortion. 177 cases had delivered, of which the majority by Cesarean section. The gestational age at delivery ranged from 28 to 41 weeks. Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes ranged from 7 to 10 and 8 to 10, respectively. A few neonates had birthweight less than 2500 grams and over one-third of cases were transferred to neonatal intensive care unit. There was one case each of neonatal asphyxia and neonatal death. There were 113 neonates that had nucleic-acid testing in throat swab, which was negative for SARS-CoV-2. From the case-reports, two maternal deaths among pregnant women with COVID-19 were reported.

ConclusionsThe clinical characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 are similar to those of nonpregnant adults with COVID-19. Currently, there is no evidence that pregnant women with COVID-19 are more prone to develop severe pneumonia, in comparison to nonpregnant patients. The subject of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial and more data is needed to investigate this possibility. Most importantly, in order to collect meaningful pregnancy and perinatal outcome data, we urge researchers and investigators to reference previously published cases in their publications and to record such reporting when the data of a case is being entered into a registry or several registries.

ContributionO_ST_ABSWhat are the novel findings of this work?C_ST_ABSAmongst a few cases from the case-series that had qRT-PCR testing in vaginal mucus and breast milks, the results were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, some of the cases from the case-series had qRT-PCR testing in amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab and neonatal feces, and the results were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Amongst the case-reports, there were two maternal deaths and two neonates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at 16 / 24 hours of life.

What are the clinical implications of this work?The subject of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial and more data is needed to investigate this possibility. In order to collect meaningful pregnancy and perinatal outcome data, we urge researchers and investigators to reference previously published cases in their publications and to record such reporting when the data of a case is being entered into a registry or several registries.","Juan, J.; Gil, M.

A case control series of 17 confirmed COVID-19 mechanically ventilated patients in prone or supine positioning was collected: 10 patients received two doses of almitrine (4 and 12 mcg/kg/min) at 30-45 min interval each, and were compared to 7 """"control"""" COVID-matched patients conventionally treated. The end-point was the reduction of intra-pulmonary shunt increasing the PaO2 and ScvO2.

Results Patients were male (59%) with median (25th, 75th percentiles) age of 70 (54-78) years and a BMI of 29 (23-34). At stable mechanical ventilatory settings, PaO2 (mmHg) at FiO2 1 (135 (85, 195) to 214 (121, 275); p = 0.06) tended to increase with almitrine. This difference was significant when the best PaO2 between the 2 doses was used: 215 (123,294) vs baseline (p = 0.01). A concomitant increase in ScvO2 occurred ((73 (72, 76) to 82 (80, 87); p = 0.02). Eight over 10 almitrine-treated patients increased their PaO2, with no clear dose-effect. During the same time, the controls did not change PaO2.

In conclusion, in early COVID-19 with severe hypoxemia, almitrine infusion is associated with improved oxygenation in prone or supine positioning. This pharmacological intervention may offer an alternative and/or an additional effect to proning and might delay or avoid more demanding modalities such as ECMO.","Losser, M.

10222,A link between inflammatory biomarkers and lung ultrasound observations in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Lung ultrasound (LUS) has shown to correlate well with the findings obtained by chest computed tomography (CT) in acute-phase COVID-19. Although there is a significant correlation between blood biomarkers and CT radiological findings, a potential correlation between biochemical parameters and LUS images is still unknown. Our purpose was to evaluate a potential association between lung lesions visualised by LUS and blood biomarkers as well as the ability to predict mortality from two different lung ultrasound scoring systems (LUSS). We performed a retrospective observational study on 45 patients aged >70 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection who required hospitalisation. LUS was carried out at admission and on day 7, when the clinical course was favourable or earlier in case of worsening. Disease severity was scored by means of LUSS in 8 (LUSS8) and in 12 (LUSS12) quadrants. LUS and blood draw for inflammatory marker analysis were performed at the same time. The correlation between biochemical parameters and either LUSS score was significant for ferritin levels. It was 0.486 (p=0.001) for LUSS8 and 0.458 (p=0.002) for LUSS12. Using a threshold score of 15 with LUSS12 predicted mortality in 86.7% of cases (ORcrude 31, CI 95% 4.79-200.51). Applying a threshold of 10 with LUSS8 predicted mortality in 88.9% (ORcrude 69.75, CI 95% 6.90-705.20). There is a correlation between ferritin levels and LUSS. The prognostic capacity of LUSS12 does not surpass that of LUSS8.

6302,On the progression of COVID19 in Portugal: A comparative analysis of active cases using non-linear regression,"Portugal has been portrayed as a relatively successful case in the control of the COVID-19s March 2020 outbreak in Europe due to the timely confinement measures taken. As other European Union member states, Portugal is now preparing the phased loosening of the confinement measures, starting in the beginning of May. Even so, the current data, albeit showing at least a reduction in infection rates, renders difficult to forecast scenarios in the imminent future. Using South Korea data as scaffold, which is becoming a paradigmatic case of recovery following a high number of infected people, we fitted Portuguese data to biphasic models using non-linear regression and compared the two countries. The results, which suggest good fit, show that recovery in Portugal can be much slower than anticipated, with a very high percentage of active cases (over 50%) remaining still active even months after the projected end of mitigation measures. This, together with the unknown number of asymptomatic carriers, may increase the risk of a much slower recovery if not of new outbreaks. Europe and elsewhere must consider this contingency when planning the relief of containment measures.","Milhinhos, A.; Costa, P. M.",2020-05-06,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.02.20088856,1,Pedro M.

20700,"Vulnerabilities in child wellbeing among primary school children: a cross-sectional study in Bradford, UK","ObjectiveTo describe the prevalence of factors related to wellbeing among primary school children in a deprived multi-ethnic community.

Design and participantsCross-sectional survey of 15,641 children aged 7-10 years in Born in Bradfords Primary School Years study: whole-classroom samples in 89 Bradford primary schools between 2016 and 2019.

Main outcome measuresPrevalence estimates by ethnicity (%, 95% CI) of single and multiple vulnerabilities in child wellbeing within and across four domains (home, family, relationships; material resources; friends and school; subjective wellbeing).

ResultsOnly 10% of children have no vulnerabilities in any domain of wellbeing; 10% have one or more vulnerabilities in all four domains. The highest prevalence estimates were for being bullied some or all of the time (52.7%, 51.9 to 53.4%), keeping worries to oneself (31.2%, 30.5 to 31.9%), having no park near home (30.8%, 30.1 to 31.5%) and worrying all the time about how much money their family has (26.3%, 25.6 to 27%).

Boys were consistently significantly more likely than girls to report all of the vulnerabilities in the Home, Family and Family Relationships domain, and the majority of indicators in the other domains, and in all domains except Friends and School, boys were significantly more likely to have at least one vulnerability. Girls were significantly more likely to report not having many friends (16.7%, 95% CI: 15.9 to 17.6% vs. 12.5%, 95% CI: 11.8 to 13.2%), being bullied some or all of the time (55.8%, 95% CI: 54.7 to 56.9% vs. 49.7%, 95% CI: 48.6 to 50.8%) and feeling left out all the time (12.1%, 95% CI: 11.4 to 12.8%) vs. 10.3%, 95% CI: 9.7 to 11.0%).

Variations in vulnerabilities by ethnicity were complex, with children in Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic groups sometimes reporting more vulnerabilities and sometimes fewer than White British children. For example, compared to children of Pakistani heritage, White British children were more likely to say that their family never gets along well (6.3%,5.6 to 7.1% vs. 4.1%,3.6 to 4.6%) and to have no access to the internet at home (22.3%,21 to 23.6% vs. 18%,17 to 18.9%). Children with Pakistani heritage were more likely than White British children to say they had no park near their home where they can play with friends (32.7%,31.6 to 33.9% vs. 29.9%,28.6 to 31.3%), to report not having three meals a day (17.9%,16.9 to 18.8% vs. 11.9%,10.9 to 12.9%) and to worry all the time about how much money their families have (29.3%,28.2 to 30.3%) vs. 21.6%,20.4 to 22.9%). Gypsy/Irish Traveller children were less likely than White British children to say they were bullied some or all of the time (42.2%,35.4 to 49.4% vs. 53.8%,52.3 to 55.3%), but more likely to say they were mean to others all the time (9.9%,6.3 to 15.2% vs. 4%,3.5 to 4.7%) and can never work out what to do when things are hard (15.2%,10.6 to 21.2% vs. 9%, 8.2 to 9.9%).

We considered six vulnerabilities to be of particular concern during the current Covid-19 pandemic and associated national and local lockdowns: family never gets along well together; no garden where child can play; no nearby park where they can play; not having 3 meals a day; no internet at home; worried about money all the time. Pre-pandemic, 37.4% (36.6 to 38.3%) of Bradford children had one of these vulnerabilities and a further 29.6% (28.9 to 30.4%) had more than one.

ConclusionsAlthough most primary school children aged 7-10 in our study have good levels of wellbeing on most indicators across multiple domains, fewer than 10% have no vulnerabilities at all, a worrying 10% have at least one vulnerability in all the four domains we studied and two thirds have vulnerabilities of concern during the Covid-19 lockdowns.","Pickett, K.

We conducted a cross-sectional study assaying the IgG and IgM antibodies in 1331 individuals with ocular diseases by using a magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay kit, during the period from February 2020 to May 2020. In our study, the seroposivity in total ocular disease patients was 0.83% (11/1331). The patients with different ocular diseases including xerophthalmia, keratitis, conjunctival cyst, cataract, glaucoma, refractive error, strabismus and others had seroposivity of 2.94%, 12.5%, 25%, 4.41%, 2.63%, 1.6%, 2.22% and 0%, respectively. Among that, two ocular surface disease groups (keratitis and conjunctival cyst) had higher seroprevalence compared with others. All the participants were reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction negative for SARS-CoV-2 from throat swabs. Our study evaluated the seroprevalence in patients with different ocular diseases, which will help us understand the relationship between ocular disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the serological test for the presence of IgM and/or IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 might provide accurate estimate of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with ocular diseases.","Li, S.; Qiu, Y.; Tang, L.; Wang, Z.; Cao, W.; Sun, X.",2020-11-19,Ophthalmology,10.1101/2020.09.22.20198465,2,Wenjun Cao,fudan university,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.22.20198465v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.22.20198465v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
14508,Maximizing and evaluating the impact of test-trace-isolate programs,"September 2, 2020

BackgroundTest-trace-isolate programs are an essential part of COVID-19 control that offer a more targeted approach than many other non-pharmaceutical interventions. Effective use of such programs requires methods to estimate their current and anticipated impact.

Methods and FindingsWe present a mathematical modeling framework to evaluate the expected reductions in the reproductive number, R, from test-trace-isolate programs. This framework is implemented in a publicly available R package and an online application. We evaluated the effects of case detection, speed of isolation, contact tracing completeness and speed of quarantine using parameters consistent with COVID-19 transmission (R0 = 2.5, generation time 6.5 days). We show that R is most sensitive to changes to the proportion of infections detected in almost all scenarios, and other metrics have a reduced impact when case detection levels are low (< 30%). Although test-trace-isolate programs can contribute substantially to reducing R, exceptional performance across all metrics is needed to bring R below one through test-trace-isolate alone, highlighting the need for comprehensive control strategies. Formally framing the dynamical process also indicates that metrics used to evaluate performance of test-trace-isolate, such as the proportion of identified infections among traced contacts, may be misleading. While estimates of program performance are sensitive to assumptions about COVID-19 natural history, our qualitative findings are robust across numerous sensitivity analyses.

ConclusionsEffective test-trace-isolate programs first need to be strong in the """"test"""" component, as case detection underlies all other program activities. Even moderately effective test-trace-isolate programs are an important tool for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, and can alleviate the need for more restrictive social distancing measures.","Grantz, K.

15136,Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio on admission to predict the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients: a meta-analysis,"The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), an inflammatory marker, was suggested to be predictive of severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients, thus allowing early risk stratification. In this study, we investigated whether NLR levels on admission could predict the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients. A literature search was conducted on 23 July 2020 to retrieve all published articles, including grey literature and preprints, investigating the association between on-admission NLR values and severity or mortality in COVID-19 patients. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). A meta-analysis was performed to determine the overall standardized mean difference (SMD) in NLR values and the pooled risk ratio (RR) for severity and mortality with the 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI). Meta-regression analysis was done to identify potential confounders. A total of 38 articles, including 5699 patients with severity outcomes and 6033 patients with mortality outcomes, were included. The meta-analysis showed that severe and non-survivors of COVID-19 had higher on-admission NLR levels than non-severe and survivors (SMD 0.88; 95%CI 0.72-1.04; I2=75% and 1.68; 95%CI 0.98-2.39; I2=99%, respectively). Regardless of the different NLR cut-off values, the pooled mortality RR in patients with elevated vs. normal NLR levels was 2.75 (95%CI 0.97-7.72). Meta-regression analysis showed that the association between NLR levels on admission and COVID-19 severity and mortality was unaffected by age (p=0.236; p=0.213, respectively). High NLR levels on admission were associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality. Further studies need to focus on determining the optimal cut-off value for NLR before clinical use.

11448,COVID-19 causing HELLP-like syndrome in pregnancy and role of angiogenic factors for differential diagnosis,"ImportanceThe clinical presentation of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome is one of the more severe forms of preeclampsia. COVID-19 infection exhibits signs that are shared with preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome, which may lead to needless interventions and iatrogenic preterm delivery.

ObjectiveWe evaluated the prevalence of HELLP-like signs in pregnant women admitted for COVID-19 and the value of angiogenic factors to rule out preeclampsia.

Methodsa consecutive series of 27 pregnant women beyond 20 weeks of gestation, with symptomatic COVID-19. Clinical and analytical features were recorded and those cases with signs of HELLP syndrome were tested for sFlt-1/PlGF ratio.

ResultsSeven patients (25.9%) presented at least one sign of suspected HELLP syndrome, of which 2 (7.4%) were diagnosed clinically with PE because of hypertension and high transaminases and 5 (18.5%) had only elevated transaminases. sFlt-1/PlGF ratio was normal in 6 of 7.

ConclusionSymptomatic COVID-19 may simulate severe preeclampsia in pregnancy. Angiogenic factors may be essential to avoid false diagnosis and needless interventions.

KEY-POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDo pregnant women with symptomatic COVID-19 infection exhibit signs shared with preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome? Are these conditions ruled out by the measurement of angiogenic factors?

FindingsIn series of 27 pregnancies with symptomatic COVID-19 infection, 7 presented at least one sign of suspected HELLP syndrome. In 6 of them, the level of angiogenic factors ruled out preeclampsia.

19812,"SIREN protocol: Impact of detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 on the subsequent incidence of COVID-19 in 100,000 healthcare workers: do antibody positive healthcare workers have less reinfection than antibody negative healthcare workers?","BackgroundThe overall risk of reinfection in individuals who have previously had COVID-19 is unknown. To determine if prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (as determined by at least one positive commercial antibody test performed in a laboratory) in healthcare workers confers future immunity to reinfection, we are undertaking a large-scale prospective longitudinal cohort study of healthcare staff across the United Kingdom.

MethodsPopulation and Setting: staff members of healthcare organisations working in hospitals in the UK

At recruitment, participants will have their serum tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 at baseline and using these results will be initially allocated to either antibody positive or antibody negative cohorts. Participants will undergo antibody and viral RNA testing at 1-4 weekly intervals throughout the study period, and based on these results may move between cohorts. Any results from testing undertaken for other reasons (e.g. symptoms, contact tracing etc.) or prior to study entry will also be included. Individuals will complete enrolment and fortnightly questionnaires on exposures and symptoms. Follow-up will be for at least 12 months from study entry.

OutcomeThe primary outcome of interest is a reinfection with SARS -CoV-2 during the study period. Secondary outcomes will include incidence and prevalence (both RNA and antibody) of SARS-CoV-2, viral genomics, viral culture, symptom history and antibody/neutralising antibody titres.

ConclusionThis large study will help us to understand the impact of the presence of antibodies on the risk of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2; the results will have substantial implications in terms of national and international policy, as well as for risk management of contacts of COVID-19 cases.

17825,Phase 1 trial of a Candidate Recombinant Virus-Like Particle Vaccine for Covid-19 Disease Produced in Plants,"Longer AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThe stabilized prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is produced by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. The trimeric spike glycoproteins are displayed at the surface of self-assembling Virus-Like-Particles that mimic the shape and the size of the virus. The candidate vaccine (CoVLP) administered alone or with AS03 or CpG1018 adjuvants was evaluated in a Phase 1 trial in healthy adults. (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT04450004)

MethodsThe study was a randomized, partially-blinded, prime-boost 21 days apart, dose-escalation Phase 1 study intended to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of CoVLP at three dose levels (3.75 {micro}g, 7.5 {micro}g, and 15 {micro}g) unadjuvanted or adjuvanted with either CpG 1018 or AS03 in 180 SARS-CoV-2 seronegative healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age. Enrollment was staggered for dose-escalation. At each dose level, the vaccine was initially administered to a small number of subjects. Vaccination of the remaining subjects at the same dose level and the next higher vaccine dose level was administered with approval of an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). The same procedure was followed for the second vaccine administration. Monitoring of safety signals was performed throughout the study with pre-determined pausing/stopping rules if there was clear evidence of harmful effects such as severe adverse events (AEs) related to the treatment. The primary endpoints were the safety and tolerability of the vaccine after each dose and the immunogenicity as assessed by neutralizing antibody responses assessed using a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudovirion assay and interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) ELISpot assays at Days 0, 21 and 42. Secondary endpoints were anti-spike antibody responses by ELISA and neutralizing antibodies measured by live virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) assay at Days 0, 21 and 42 and immunogenicity with additional safety and immunogenicity endpoints planned for 6-months following the last vaccination. The anti-spike and neutralizing antibody responses were compared with 23 convalescent serum samples from symptomatic Covid-19 patients. We performed a primary analysis at day 42.

ResultsA total of 180 subjects (102 females: 78 males: average 34.3 years) were recruited to the study and interim safety and immunogenicity data up to day 42 after the first dose are reported here. There was no obvious CoVLP dose effect in safety outcomes for any of the formulations tested and all formulations were generally well-tolerated. Most solicited local and systemic AEs were mild-moderate and transient. Reactogenicity was increased in all adjuvanted formulations and was generally highest in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. Local and systemic adverse events were reported with similar frequency after the first and second doses in subjects who received either CoVLP alone or CoVLP+CpG1018 but increased in both frequency and severity after the second dose in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. CoVLP alone only elicited a weak total anti-spike IgG response at the highest dose level and little-to-no neutralization antibody response, even after the second dose. Cellular responses in the CoVLP alone groups (IFN{gamma} and IL-4) were detectable after the second dose but were still only marginally above background levels. The addition of either adjuvant substantially increased both antibody and cellular responses at most CoVLP dose levels and changes were most pronounced after the second dose. However, a substantial neutralizing antibody response after the first dose was only seen in all CoVLP+AS03 groups. After the second dose, both total anti-spike IgG and neutralizing antibody titers in the CoVLP+AS03 groups were higher than those in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups. The antibody titers achieved were either similar to (CoVLP+CpG1018) or at least 10-times higher (CoVLP+AS03) than those seen in convalescent plasma. Administration of CoVLP with either adjuvant also significantly increased the cellular responses. After 2 doses, both IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 responses were significantly increased in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups. In the CoVLP+AS03 groups, significant increases in the cellular responses were observed after the first dose while IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 increased further in both magnitude and number of subjects responding after the second dose. Again, the cellular responses in the CoVLP+AS03 groups were higher than those seen in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups.

ConclusionThese data demonstrate that CoVLP administered with either CpG1018 or AS03 has a safety profile similar to other candidate vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. When administered with either AS03 or CpG1018, several of the CoVLP dose levels elicited strong humoral and T cell responses after the second dose. When administered with AS03, even the 3.75 g CoVLP dose elicited neutralizing antibody titers that were [~]10-times higher than those observed in individuals recovering from Covid-19 as well as consistent and balanced IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 responses. Although many CoVLP formulations were immunogenic, in the absence of established correlates of protection and given the advantages of dose-sparing in the context of the on-going pandemic, these findings suggest that CoVLP (3.75 g)+AS03 has a good benefit/risk ratio and support the transition of this formulation to studies in expanded populations and to efficacy evaluations

This candidate vaccine (CoVLP) was evaluated in healthy adults 18-55 years of age alone or with AS03 or CpG1018 (NCT04450004).

MethodsThis randomized, partially-blinded, two-dose, dose-escalation study assessed CoVLP (3.75, 7.5 or 15 {micro}g/dose) administered intramuscularly alone or with CpG1018 or AS03 in SARS-CoV-2 seronegative adults (18-55 years). Primary endpoints of safety and immunogenicity are reported to day 42. Neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) were assessed using a VSV pseudovirus assay and cellular responses by ELISpot (IFN{gamma}, IL-4).

Results180 subjects (avg.34.3yrs) were recruited. All formulations were well-tolerated but adjuvants increased reactogenicity. Adverse events were highest in the CoVLP+AS03 groups and increased in frequency/severity after dose two. CoVLP alone elicited weak humoral responses but modest cellular responses were detectable after dose two. Both adjuvants increased immunogenicity significantly, particularly after dose two. A significant NtAb response after dose one was only seen in CoVLP+AS03 groups. The vaccine dose had little impact on levels of NtAb responses achieved in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. Both adjuvants also increased IFN{gamma} and IL-4 responses but these cellular responses also tended to be highest in the AS03-adjuvanted groups.

ConclusionCoVLP {+/-} adjuvants was well-tolerated. Several adjuvanted formulations elicited strong humoral and T cell responses after dose 2. Even at the lowest CoVLP+AS03 dose, NtAb titers were [~]10-times higher than in convalescent serum with a balanced IFN{gamma} and IL-4 response. These findings support the transition of CoVLP (3.75g+AS03) to further clinical evaluation.

Research In ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was recognized as the causative agent of COVID-19 in early 2020. Since that time, >150 candidate vaccines are reported to be under development of which 47 have entered clinical trials (https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines accessed Nov 4, 2020). No vaccine to prevent COVID-19 has been licensed yet for either emergency or general use in North America or Europe. We searched PubMed for research articles published between July 2019 and November 4, 2020, using the terms """"SARS-CoV-2"""", """"vaccine"""", """"clinical trial"""" OR """"human"""", AND """"phase"""". The same terms were used to search ClinTrials.gov. No language restrictions were applied. We identified 10 peer-reviewed studies, describing phase 1 or 1/2 trials using a range of novel (eg: RNA, DNA, non-replicating virus vectored) and more traditional vaccine approaches (eg: inactivated virus or recombinant protein {+/-} adjuvants). None of these candidate vaccines was produced in plants. These reports demonstrate that several different vaccination strategies (typically delivered in two doses 14-28 days apart) are capable of eliciting neutralizing antibody responses. In several cases, vaccine-induced cellular responses against SARS-COV-2 antigens - predominantly the spike (S) protein - can also be demonstrated. Although local and systemic adverse events following vaccination have varied between reports, the trials published to date suggest that each of these candidate vaccines is well-tolerated in the context of an evolving pandemic.

Added value of this studyWe report the results of the first clinical study of CoVLP, a virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine that is produced by transient transfection of Nicotiana benthamiana plants. These VLPs spontaneously assemble at the plant cell membrane and display SARS-COV-2 trimers of stabilized pre-fusion S protein on their surface. The vaccine was administered as two intramuscular doses 21 days apart at three dose levels (S protein content 3.75, 7,5 or 15g) alone or adjuvanted with either CpG1018 or AS03. All formulations were well-tolerated although both adjuvants increased reactogenicity. Humoral (anti-S IgG and neutralizing antibodies) as well as cellular responses (IFNg and IL4 ELISpots) were detectable in almost all subjects who received adjuvanted formulations 21 days after the second dose at all COVLP dose levels. Both antibody and cellular responses were highest in subjects who received AS03-adjuvanted formulations. Even at the lowest dose level (3.75g), the neutralizing antibody titers 21 days after the second dose in subjects who received the AS03-afdjuvanted vaccine were 10-50-fold higher than those seen in subjects recovering from COVID-19 infection.

Implications of all the available evidenceEffective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed to reduce the burden of disease and contribute to ending the global pandemic. Although no immune correlates for SARS-CoV-2 have been defined, it is likely that both arms of the immune system contribute to protection. After two doses of CoVLP (3.75g+AS03), strong humoral and cellular responses were induced supporting the further clinical development of this vaccine.","Ward, B.

7687,The Hybrid Forecasting Method SVR-ESAR forCovid-19,"We know that SARS-Cov2 produces the new COVID-19 disease, which is one of the most dangerous pandemics of modern times. This pandemic has critical health and economic consequences, and even the health services of the large, powerful nations may be saturated. Thus, forecasting the number of infected persons in any country is essential for controlling the situation. In the literature, different forecasting methods have been published, attempting to solve the problem. However, a simple and accurate forecasting method is required for its implementation in any part of the world. This paper presents a precise and straightforward forecasting method named SVR-ESAR (Support Vector regression hybridized with the classical Exponential smoothing and ARIMA). We applied this method to the infected time series in four scenarios, which we have taken for the Github repository: the Whole World, China, the US, and Mexico. We compared our results with those of the literature showing the proposed method has the best accuracy.","Frausto-Solis, J.; Olvera Vazquez, J. E.; Gonzalez-Barbosa, J.

13855,Dynamic causal modeling of the COVID-19 pandemic in northern Italy predicts possible scenarios for the second wave,"The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked an intense debate about the factors underlying the dynamics of the outbreak. Mitigating virus spread could benefit from reliable predictive models that inform effective social and healthcare strategies. Crucially, the predictive validity of these models depends upon incorporating behavioral and social responses to infection that underwrite ongoing social and healthcare strategies. Formally, the problem at hand is not unlike the one faced in neuroscience when modelling brain dynamics in terms of the activity of a neural network: the recent COVID-19 pandemic develops in epicenters (e.g. cities or regions) and diffuses through transmission channels (e.g., population fluxes). Indeed, the analytic framework known as """"Dynamic Causal Modeling"""" (DCM) has recently been applied to the COVID-19 pandemic, shedding new light on the mechanisms and latent factors driving its evolution. The DCM approach rests on a time-series generative model that provides -- through Bayesian model inversion and inference -- estimates of the factors underlying the progression of the pandemic. We have applied DCM to data from northern Italian regions, which were the first areas in Europe to contend with the COVID-19 outbreak. We used official data on the number of daily confirmed cases, recovered cases, deaths and performed tests. The model -- parameterized using data from the first months of the pandemic phase -- was able to accurately predict its subsequent evolution (including social mobility, as assessed through GPS monitoring, and seroprevalence, as assessed through serologic testing) and revealed the potential factors underlying regional heterogeneity. Importantly, the model predicts that a second wave could arise due to a loss of effective immunity after about 7 months. This second wave was predicted to be substantially worse if outbreaks are not promptly isolated and contained. In short, dynamic causal modelling appears to be a reliable tool to shape and predict the spread of the COVID-19, and to identify the containment and control strategies that could efficiently counteract its second wave, until effective vaccines become available.","Gandolfi, D.; Pagnoni, G.; Filippini, T.; Goffi, A.; Vinceti, M.; D'angelo, E.

22684,"Factors Associated with Timely Test Seeking, Test Turnaround, and Public Reporting of COVID-19: a retrospective analysis in Ontario, Canada","BackgroundMinimizing delays in disease identification and reporting improves the timeliness of surveillance data, and can reduce transmission of COVID-19. Our study investigates factors associated with timely testing and reporting of COVID-19 during the first pandemic wave in one province of Canada.

MethodsWe identified all persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection residing in private households across the largest province of Canada, Ontario from the date of the first confirmed case in Ontario (January 25) to July 19, 2020. Our primary outcomes consisted of: (1) specimen collection within 1 day of symptom onset (test seeking), (2) test result reported to local public health within 1 day of specimen collection (test turnaround), and (3) entry of case data into the provincial database within 1 day of reporting test results (reporting). We examined 14 covariates including eight case characteristics, and six neighborhood characteristics. In addition to descriptive measures, logistic regression models were fitted. Unadjusted models included the covariate alone, while adjusted models included age, gender, month, and region.

FindingsAmong 27,198 COVID-19 cases from January 25 2020 to July 19 2020, 28{middle dot}7% had timely test seeking, 40{middle dot}2% had timely test turnaround, and 75{middle dot}5% had timely reporting. Male gender had lower odds of timely test seeking (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0{middle dot}79 [95% CI: 0{middle dot}74-0{middle dot}85]) compared to females. Healthcare worker status (aOR 2{middle dot}77 [95% CI: 2{middle dot}52-3{middle dot}05] compared to non-healthcare workers), and age [&ge;]80 years (aOR 1{middle dot}59 [95% CI: 1{middle dot}33-1{middle dot}91] compared to 40-59 year olds) were associated with timely test seeking. Specimen collection on Fridays and Saturdays (aOR 0{middle dot}88 [95% CI: 0{middle dot}79-0{middle dot}98], aOR 0{middle dot}83 [95% CI: 0{middle dot}74-0{middle dot}92] respectively, compared to Wednesdays) had lower odds of timely test turnaround. Urban areas (aOR 1{middle dot}55 [95% CI: 1{middle dot}41-1{middle dot}70] compared to rural areas) were associated with timely test turnaround. Urban areas (aOR 0{middle dot}79 [95% CI: 0{middle dot}70-0{middle dot}89] compared to rural areas) were less likely to have timely reporting.

InterpretationIndividual, neighborhood, and administrative factors are associated with timely testing and reporting of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These findings present considerations for developing targeted strategies to minimize delays and improve timely testing and reporting of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

FundingThis study was funded by Public Health Ontario.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed and medRxiv up to November 30 2020 to identify studies examining the impact of delays in the disease reporting process on the public health response to COVID-19. We used the search terms (""""2019-nCoV"""" OR """"COVID-19"""" OR """"SARS-CoV-2"""") AND (""""delays"""" OR """"timely"""" OR """"reporting"""" OR """"test"""" OR """"turnaround""""), and reviewed reference lists of any relevant articles in the original search. Numerous modeling studies have highlighted the importance of timely testing and reporting to effectively control the spread of COVID-19. Additional studies have also identified delays of only 1 day in testing were associated with increased risk of secondary transmission within households. However no study has described the multiple delays in the disease reporting process of COVID-19 and examined factors associated with timely disease reporting using a large population cohort.

Added value of this studyOur study described timely test seeking, test turnaround, and reporting for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ontario, Canada and identified associated individual, neighbourhood, and administrative factors. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to describe detailed delays in the disease reporting process of COVID-19 and identified associated factors using a large population cohort.

Implications of all the available evidenceNumerous individual, neighborhood, and administrative characteristics are associated with timely testing and reporting of COVID-19. These identified factors may be used to develop strategies such as broadened test access, prioritization of vulnerable populations, and increased testing capacity to reduce delays in testing and reporting and improve the effectiveness of public health response to COVID-19.","Joh, E.; Buchan, S.

8209,COVID-19 impact on consecutive neurological patients admitted to the emergency department,"ObjectiveAim of this study was to analyse the impact of COVID-19 on clinical and laboratory findings and outcome of neurological patients consecutively admitted to the emergency department (ED) of a tertiary hub center.

MethodsAll adult patients consecutively admitted to the ED for neurological manifestations from February 20th through April 30th 2020 at Spedali Civili of Brescia entered the study. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were extracted from medical records and compared between patients with and without COVID-19.

ResultsOut of 505 consecutively patients evaluated at ED with neurological symptoms, 147 (29.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. These patients displayed at triage higher values of CRP, AST, ALT, and fibrinogen but not lymphopenia (p<0.05). They were older (73.1 {+/-} 12.4 vs 65.1 {+/-} 18.9 years, p=0.001) had higher frequency of stroke (34.7% vs 29.3%), encephalitis/meningitis (9.5% vs 1.9%) and delirium (16.3% vs 5.0%). Compared to patients without COVID, they were more frequently hospitalized (91.2% vs 69.3%, p<0.0001) and showed higher mortality rates (29.7% vs 1.8%, p<0.0.001) and discharge disability, independently from age.

ConclusionsCOVID-19 impacts on clinical presentation of neurological disorders, with higher frequency of stroke, encephalitis and delirium, and was strongly associated with increased hospitalisation, mortality and disability.","Pilotto, A.; Benussi, A.; Libri, I.; Masciocchi, S.; Poli, L.; Premi, E.; Alberici, A.; Baldelli, E.; Bonacina, S.; Brambilla, L.; Benini, M.; Caratozzolo, S.; Cortinovis, M.; Costa, A.; Cotti Piccinelli, S.; Cottini, E.; Cristillo, V.; Delrio, I.; Filosto, M.; Gamba, M.; Gazzina, S.; Gilberti, N.; Gipponi, S.; Giunta, M.; Imarisio, A.; Liberini, P.; Locatelli, M.; Schiano Di Cola, F.; Rao, R.; Risi, B.; Rozzini, L.; Scalvini, A.; Vergani, V.; Volonghi, I.; Zoppi, N.; Borroni, B.; Magoni, M.; Leonardi, M.; Zanusso, G.; Ferrari, S.; Mariotto, S.; Pezzini, A.; Gasparotti, R.; Paolillo, C.; Padov",2020-05-26,Neurology,10.1101/2020.05.23.20110650,1,Alessandro Padovani,University of Brescia,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.23.20110650v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.23.20110650v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1136/jnnp-2020-323929
2457,Effects of Chinese strategies for controlling the diffusion and deterioration of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in China,"BackgroundIn December 2019, an outbreak of new type of coronavirus named COVID-19 occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. In a very short time, this virus spread rapidly over China, greatly threatening public health and economic development. The Chinese government acted quickly and implemented a series of strategies to prevent diffusion of this disease. We therefore sought to evaluate the effects of these Chinese strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19.

MethodsFrom the data of cumulative confirmed cases from provincial Health Commission websites of China, we performed model fitting and calculated the growth speed of cumulative confirmed patients. We further analyzed the time when this growth speed, the rate of the number of new cases, reached its maximum (Speedmax). Comparing different times to Speedmax of different areas in China, we calculated the dates at which the growth speed began to decline in different areas. Also, The number of plateaus were analyzed.

ResultsThe quartic model showed the best fit. For almost all areas in mainland China, the speed of infections reached Speedmax and began to decline within 14 days; exceptions were Hebei, Heilongjiang, Hainan, Guizhou, and Hubei. The number of plateaus was significantly correlated with the emigration index. However, the distance from other areas to Hubei and the number of plateaus had little influence on when a province or area arrived at Speedmax. Once strict intervention strategies were implemented, diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 were inhibited quickly and effectively over China.

ConclusionOur study suggests that Chinese strategies are highly effective on controlling the diffusion and deterioration of the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia. These strategies supply experience and guidelines for other countries to control the COVID-19 epidemic.","Wang, X.; Tian, W.; Lv, X.; Shi, Y.; Zhou, X.; Yu, W.; Su, D.; Tian, J.",2020-03-12,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.10.20032755,1,Jie Tian,"Department of Anesthesiology, Renji Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.20032755v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.20032755v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
23210,Predictive Capacity of COVID-19 Test Positivity Rate,"COVID-19 infections can spread silently, due to the simultaneous presence of significant numbers of both critical and asymptomatic to mild cases. While for the former reliable data are available (in the form of number of hospitalization and/or beds in intensive care units), this is not the case of the latter. Hence, analytical tools designed to generate reliable forecast and future scenarios, should be implemented to help decision makers planning ahead (e.g. medical structures and equipment). Previous work of one of the authors shows that an alternative formulation of the Test Positivity Rate (TPR), i.e. the proportion of the number of persons tested positive in a given day, exhibits a strong correlation with the number of patients admitted in hospital and intensive care units. In this paper, we investigate the lagged correlation structure between the newly defined TPR and the hospitalized people time series, exploiting a rigorous statistical model, the Seasonal Auto Regressive Moving Average (SARIMA). The rigorous analytical framework chosen, i.e. the stochastic processes theory, allowed for a reliable forecasting about 12 days ahead, of those quantities. The proposed approach would also allow decision makers to forecast the number of beds in hospitals and intensive care units needed 12 days ahead. The obtained results show that a standardized TPR index is a valuable metric to monitor the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic. The index can be computed on daily basis and it is probably one of the best forecasting tools available today for predicting hospital and intensive care units overload, being an optimal compromise between simplicity of calculation and accuracy.","Fenga, L.; Gaspari, M.",2021-03-10,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.03.04.21252897,2,Mauro Gaspari,University of Bologna,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.04.21252897v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.04.21252897v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.3390/s21072435

13632,Colorimetric Test for Fast Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Nasal and Throat Swabs,"Mass testing is fundamental to face the pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 discovered at the end of 2019. To this aim, it is necessary to establish reliable, fast and cheap tools to detect viral particles in biological material so to identify the people capable to spread the infection. We demonstrate that a colorimetric biosensor based on gold nanoparticle (AuNP) interaction induced by SARS-CoV-2 lends itself as an outstanding tool for detecting viral particles in nasal and throat swabs. The extinction spectrum of a colloidal solution of multiple viral-target gold nanoparticles - AuNPs functionalized with antibodies targeting three surface proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (spike, envelope and membrane) - is redshifted in few minutes when mixed to a solution containing the viral particle. The optical density of the mixed solution measured at 560 nm was compared to the threshold cycle (Ct) of a Real Time-PCR (gold standard for detecting the presence of viruses) finding that the colorimetric method is able to detect very low viral load with a detection limit approaching that of RT-PCR. Since the method is sensitive to the infecting viral particle rather than to its RNA, the achievements reported here open new perspective not only in the context of the current and possible future pandemics, but also in microbiology as the biosensor proves itself to be a powerful though simple tool for measuring the viral particle concentration.","Della Ventura, B.; Cennamo, M.; Minopoli, A.; Campanile, R.; Bolletti Censi, S.; Terracciano, D.; Portella, G.; Velotta, R.",2020-08-18,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.15.20175489,1,Raffaele Velotta,"University of Naples \""""Federico II\""""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20175489v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20175489v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1021/acssensors.0c01742
18873,"Are psychiatric disorders risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity? a two-sample, bidirectional, univariable and multivariable Mendelian Randomization study","Observational studies have suggested bidirectional associations between psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 phenotypes, but results of such studies are inconsistent. Mendelian Randomization (MR) may overcome limitations of observational studies, e.g. unmeasured confounding and uncertainties about cause and effect. We aimed to elucidate associations between neuropsychiatric disorders and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. To that end, we applied a two-sample, bidirectional, univariable and multivariable MR design to genetic data from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of neuropsychiatric disorders and COVID-19 phenotypes (released on 20 Oct. 2020). In single-variable Generalized Summary MR analysis the most significant and only Bonferroni-corrected significant result was found for genetic liability to BIP-SCZ (a combined GWAS of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia as cases vs. controls) increasing risk of COVID-19 (OR = 1.17, 95% CI, 1.06-1.28). However, we found a significant, positive genetic correlation between BIP-SCZ and COVID-19 of 0.295 and could not confirm causal or horizontally pleiotropic effects using another method. No genetic liabilities to COVID-19 phenotypes increased risk of (neuro)psychiatric disorders. In multivariable MR using both neuropsychiatric and a range of other phenotypes, only genetic instruments of BMI remained causally associated with COVID-19. All sensitivity analyses confirmed the results. In conclusion, while genetic liability to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia combined slightly increased COVID-19 susceptibility in one univariable analysis, other MR and multivariable analyses could only confirm genetic underpinnings of BMI to be causally implicated in COVID-19 susceptibility. Thus, using MR we found no consistent proof of genetic liabilities to (neuro)psychiatric disorders contributing to COVID-19 liability or vice versa, which is in line with at least two observational studies. Previously reported positive associations between psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 by others may have resulted from statistical models incompletely capturing BMI as a continuous covariate.","Luykx, J.; Lin, B.",2021-03-10,Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology,10.1101/2020.11.29.20240481,2,Jurjen Luykx,UMCU,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.29.20240481v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.29.20240481v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
24422,A RANDOMIZED TRIAL - INTENSIVE TREATMENT BASED IN IVERMECTIN AND IOTA-CARRAGEENAN AS PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS FOR COVID- 19 IN HEALTHCARE AGENTS,"Key PointO_ST_ABSIMPORTANCEC_ST_ABSThe emergency of COVID-19 requires the implementation of urgent strategies to prevent the spread of the disease, mainly in health personnel, who are the most exposed and has the highest risk of becoming infected with the SARS-COV-2. Drug repurposing is a pragmatic strategy, a faster and cheaper option, compared to the new drug development that has proven successful for many drugs and can be a key tool in emergency situations such as the current one that requires quick action. In addition, considering the limited access to vaccines for developing countries, preventive use of ivermectin can be a palliative that minimizes the risks of infection.

OBJECTIVETo evaluate the protective effect of the combination Ivermectin / Iota-Carrageenan (IVER/IOTACRC), intensive treatment with repeated administration in oral- and nasal-spray, respectively, as a prophylaxis treatment prior to exposure to SARS-CoV-2, in health personnel at Public Healthcare Centers.

PARTICIPANTS, DESIGN AND SETTINGRandomized controlled 1-1 clinical trial in Personal Health, n = 234. The subjects were divided into experimental (EG: n=117; 39.6 {+/-} 9.4 years old, 65F) and control groups (CG: n=117; 38.4 {+/-} 7.4 years old, 61F). The EG received Ivermectin orally 2 tablets of 6 mg = 12 mg every 7 days, and Iota-Carrageenan 6 sprays per day for 4 weeks. All participants were evaluated by physical examination COVID-19 diagnosed with negative RT-PCR at the beginning, final, and follow-up of the protocol. Differences between the variables were determined using the Chi-square test. The proportion test almost contagious subject and the contagion risk (Odds Ratio) were calculated using software STATA. The level of statistical significance was reached when p-Value < 0.05.

RESULTThe number of subjects who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in EG was lower, only 4 of 117 (3.4%) than subjects in CG: 25 of 117 (21.4%) (P-Value = 1.10-5). Nineteen patients had mild symptoms, 4 were in EG whereas, 15 were in CG (p-Value = 0.001). Seven subjects were moderate, and 3 with severe diagnostics, all them in CG. The probability (Odds Ratio) of becoming ill with COVID-19 was significantly lower in EG with values of 0.13, 95% 0.03 to 0.40; p-Value = 1.10-4, this value (<1) indicates a protective effect of the IVER/IOTACRC in the EG. Logistic regression test demonstrated that treatment was effective to prevent COVID-19 (Odds Ratio 0.11, 95% 0.03 to 0.33; p-Value = 1.10-4). We also found that when increase the age, decrease contagious risk (Odds Ratio 0, 93, 95% 0.88 to 0.98, p-Value= 0, 02). On the other hand, the probability of contracting COVID-19 was dependent on the patients preexisting comorbidity (Odds Ratio 5.58, 95% 2.20 to 14.16, p-Value = 1.10-5). The other variables sex and designation were independent.

CONCLUSIONThe intensive preventive treatment (short-term) with IVER/IOTACRC was able to reduce the number of health workers infected with COVID-19. This treatment had also effect in preventing the severity of the disease, since all patients treated were mild. We propose a new therapeutic alternative for prevention and short-term intervention scheme (intensive) that is of benefit of the health worker in this pandemic accelerated time. This intervention did not produce lack of adherence to treatment or adverse effects.

22346,Excess Mortality in Suicide caused by COVID-19 in Japan,"BackgroundCountermeasures against COVID-19 outbreak such as lockdown and voluntary restrictions against going out adversely affect human stress and economic activity. Particularly, this stress might lead to suicide.

ObjectWe examined excess mortality attributable to suicide caused by COVID-19.

MethodWe applied the NIID model to suicide deaths from October 2009 through November, 2020 for the whole of Japan for both genders. Effects of the great earthquake that struck in eastern Japan on March 11, 2011 were incorporated into the estimation model.

ResultsSignificant excess mortality in suicide was found between July and November in 2020 for both genders. It was greater among females than among males. In total, 1599 excess cases of mortality were identified.

Discussion and ConclusionExcess mortality during the four months was more than two times greater than the number of COVID-19 deaths confirmed by PCR testing. Countermeasures against COVID-19 should be chosen carefully in light of suicide effects.","Kurita, J.; Sugishita, Y.; Sugawara, T.; Ohkusa, Y.",2021-04-12,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.02.13.21251670,3,Junko Kurita,"Tokiwa University, Ibaraki, Japan",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.13.21251670v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.13.21251670v3.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

DesignSingle-centre, evaluator-blinded, two-arm, parallel design, randomized controlled clinical trial.

ParticipantsModerate and severe COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory syndrome.

InterventionUSWD for 10 minutes twice daily for 12 consecutive days along with standard medical treatment (USWD group, n = 25), versus standard medical treatment alone (control group, n = 25).

Outcome measuresThe primary outcomes were the duration of recovery and negative conversion rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on days 7, 14, 21, and 28. Secondary outcomes included clinical status (seven-category ordinal and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) scores), computed tomography (CT), routine blood tests, and adverse events.

ResultsTime to clinical recovery (USWD 36.84{+/-}9.93 vs. control 43.56{+/-}12.15, P = 0.037) was significantly shortened with a between-group difference of 6.72 days. Clinical status was improved with significant between-group differences on day 28 (SIRS, P = 0.011; seven-category scale, P = 0.003). The rate of RNA negative conversion at days 7 (P = 0.066), 14 (P = 0.239), 21 (P = 0.269), and 28 (P = 0.490) was statistically insignificant. Moreover, insignificant differences were observed in the artificial intelligence-assisted CT analysis. No treatment-associated adverse events or worsening of pulmonary fibrosis were observed.

ConclusionUSWD, as adjunctive therapy, shortened the recovery course and improved clinical status of patients with COVID-19 without aggravating pulmonary fibrosis. the findings are limited due to the small sample size and early termination.

24947,Immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine in Dialysis,"BackgroundPatients receiving maintenance dialysis represent a high risk, immune-compromised population with 15-25% COVID mortality rate who were unrepresented in clinical trials evaluated for mRNA vaccines emergency use authorization.

MethodAll patients receiving maintenance dialysis that received two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines with antibody test results drawn [&ge;]14 days after the second dose, as documented in the electronic health record through March 18, 2021 were included. We report seroresponse based on levels of immunoglobulin-G against the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen (seropositive [&ge;]2) using FDA-approved semi-quantitative chemiluminescent assay (ADVIA Centaur(R) XP/XPT COV2G).

ResultsAmong 186 dialysis patients from 32 clinics in 8 states tested 23{+/-}8 days after receiving 2 vaccine doses, mean age was 68{+/-}12 years, with 47% women, 21% Black, 26% residents in long-term care facilities and 97% undergoing in-center hemodialysis. Overall seropositive rate was 165/186 (88.7%) with 70% at maximum titer and with no significant difference in seropositivity between BNT162b2/Pfizer (N=148) and mRNA-1273/Moderna (N=18) vaccines (88.1% vs. 94.4%, p=0.42). Among patients with COVID-19 history, seropositive rate was 38/38 (100%) with 97% at maximum titer.

ConclusionMost patients receiving maintenance dialysis were seropositive after two doses of BNT162b2/Pfizer or mRNA-1273/Moderna vaccine. Early evidence suggests that vaccinated dialysis patients with prior COVID-19 develop robust antibody response. These results support an equitable and aggressive vaccination strategy for eligible dialysis patients, regardless of age, sex, race, ethnicity, or disability, to prevent the extremely high morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 in this high risk population.

SignificanceIn this retrospective observational evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine response defined by detectable levels of immunoglobulin-G against the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen of [&ge;]2 in serum of patients receiving maintenance dialysis, 165/186 (88.7%) were found to be seropositive (with 70% at maximum titer) at least 14 days after completing the second dose. No significant differences were observed by race or other subgroup or by vaccine manufacturer. Therefore, an equitable and aggressive vaccination strategy for all eligible maintenance dialysis patients, regardless of age, sex, race, ethnicity, or disability, is warranted to prevent the extremely high morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 in this high risk population.","Lacson, E.; Argyropoulos, C.

3547,Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus in semen and testicular biopsy specimen of COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundAs of March 11, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared as a pandemic. Expending our understanding of the transmission routes of the viral infection is crucial in controlling the outbreak. It is unclear whether the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) can directly infect the testes or male genital tract and be sexually transmitted from males.

MethodsFrom January 31 to March 14, 2020, 12 patients in recovery and one patient died of COVID-19 were included in this descriptive study. The clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, chest CT scans and outcome data were recorded. To examine whether there is sexual transmission from male, we employed realtime polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect 2019-nCov in semen or testicular biopsy specimen.

FindingsThe age range of the 12 patients in recovery was 22-38 years. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia. As of March 14, 2020, ten patients discharged from the hospital while the rest 2 had developed into recovery stage. All of the 12 patients in recovery tested negative for 2019-nCoV RNA in semen samples. Another patient aged 67 died in March 10, 2020, whose tissue sample via testicular biopsy was also tested negative for viral RNA.

ConclusionNo positive RT-PCR result was found in the semen or testicular biopsy specimen. The results from this study show no evidence of sexual transmission of 2019-nCov from males.","Song, C.; Wang, Y.; Li, W.; Hu, B.; Chen, G.; Xia, P.; Wang, W.; Li, C.; Hu, Z.; Yang, X.; Yao, B.; Liu, Y.",2020-04-10,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.31.20042333,2,Xiaoyu Yang,JiangSu Province Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20042333v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20042333v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
14268,"Positive association of Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers, not Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors, with an increased vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients hospitalized for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia","BackgroundAngiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) type 2 is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 for entry into lungs cells. Because ACE-2 may be modulated by ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), there is concern that patients treated with ACEIs and ARBs are at higher risk for COVID-19 infection.

AimThis study sought to analyze the association of COVID-19 with previous treatment with ACEI and ARB.

MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed 684 consecutive patients hospitalized for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia and tested by PCR. Patients were split into 2 groups, whether (group 1, n=484) or not (group 2, n=250) COVID-19 was confirmed. Multivariate adjusted comparisons included a propensity score analysis.

ResultsAge was 63.6{+/-}18.7 years, and 302(44%) were female. Hypertension was present in 42.6% and 38.4% patients of group 1 and 2, respectively (P=0.28). A treatment with ARBs (20.7% versus 12.0%, respectively, OR 1.92, 95% confidence interval [1.23-2.98], p=0.004) was more frequent in patients of group 1 than in group 2. No difference was found for treatment with ACEIs (12.7% vs 15.7%, respectively, OR 0.81 [0.52-1.26], p=0.35). Propensity score matched multivariate logistic regression confirmed a significant association between COVID-19 and a previous treatment with ARBs (adjusted OR 2.18 [1.29-3.67], p=0.004). Significant interaction between ARBs and ACEIs for the risk of COVID-19 was observed in patients aged>60, women, and hypertensive patients.

ConclusionThis study suggests that ACEIs and ARBs are not similarly associated with the COVID-19. In this retrospective series, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia received more frequently a previous treatment with ARBs, than patients without COVID-19.","Georges, J.-L.; Floriane Gilles, F.; Cochet, H.; Bertrand, A.; De Tournemire, M.; Monguillon, V.; Pasqualini, M.; Prevot, A.; Roger, G.; Saba, J.; Soltani, J.; Koukabi-Fradelizi, M.; Beressi, J.

3203,A modified SEIR model to predict the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain and Italy: simulating control scenarios and multi-scale epidemics,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWAfter the spread of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic out of China, evolution in the pandemic worldwide shows dramatic differences among countries. In Europe, the situation of Italy first and later Spain has generated great concern, and despite other countries show better prospects, large uncertainties yet remain on the future evolution and the efficacy of containment, mitigation or attack strategies. Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we also incorporate effects of varying proportions of containment. We fit data to quarantined populations in order to account for the uncertainties in case reporting and study the scenario projections for the 17 individual regions (CCAA). Results indicate that with data for March 23, the epidemics follows an evolution similar to the isolation of 1, 5 percent of the population and if there were no effects of intervention actions it might reach a maximum over 1.4M infected around April27. The effect on the epidemics of the ongoing partial confinement measures is yet unknown (an update of results with data until March 31st is included), but increasing the isolation around ten times more could drastically reduce the peak to over 100k cases by early April, while each day of delay in taking this hard containment scenario represents an 90 percent increase of the infected population at the peak. Dynamics at the sub aggregated levels of CCAA show epidemics at the different levels of progression with the most worrying situation in Madrid an Catalonia. Increasing alpha values up to 10 times, in addition to a drastic reduction in clinical cases, would also more than halve the number of deaths. Updates for March 31st simulations indicate a substantial reduction in burden is underway. A similar approach conducted for Italy pre- and post-interventions also begins to suggest substantial reduction in both infected and deaths has been achieved, showing the efficacy of drastic social distancing interventions.","Lopez, L.

19045,Real-life evaluation of a rapid antigen test (Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device) for SARS-CoV-2 detection in asymptomatic close contacts of COVID-19 patients,"ObjectivesThere is limited information on the performance of rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests to identify SARS-CoV-2-infected asymptomatic individuals. In this field study, we evaluated the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (Abbott Diagnostics, Jena, Germany) for the purpose.

MethodsA total of 634 individuals (355 female; median age, 37 years; range, 9-87) were enrolled. Household (n=338) contacts were tested at a median of 2 days (range, 1-7) after diagnosis of the index case and non-household contacts (n=296) at a median of 6 days (range, 1-7) after exposure. RAD testing was carried out at the point of care. The RT-PCR test used was the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA).

ResultsIn total, 79 individuals (12.4%) tested positive by RT-PCR, of whom 38 (48.1%) yielded positive RAD results. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the RAD test was 48.1% (95% CI: 37.4-58.9) and 100% (95% CI: 99.3-100), respectively. Sensitivity was higher in household (50.8%; 95% CI: 38.9-62.5) than in non-household (35.7%; 95% CI:16.3-61.2%) contacts. Individuals testing positive by RAD test were more likely (P<0.001) to become symptomatic than their negative counterparts.

ConclusionThe Panbio test displays low sensitivity in asymptomatic close contacts of COVID-19 patients, particularly in non-household contacts. Nonetheless, establishing the optimal timing for upper respiratory tract collection in this group seems imperative to pinpoint test sensitivity.","Torres, I.; Poujois, S.; Albert, E.; Colomina, J.; Navarro, D.",2020-12-02,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.12.01.20241562,1,David Navarro,"Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.01.20241562v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.01.20241562v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.cmi.2020.12.022
9365,Sex differences in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 that underlie disease outcomes,"A growing body of evidence indicates sex differences in the clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1-4. However, whether immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 differ between sexes, and whether such differences explain male susceptibility to COVID-19, is currently unknown. In this study, we examined sex differences in viral loads, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody titers, plasma cytokines, as well as blood cell phenotyping in COVID-19 patients. By focusing our analysis on patients with mild to moderate disease who had not received immunomodulatory medications, our results revealed that male patients had higher plasma levels of innate immune cytokines and chemokines including IL-8, IL-18, and CCL5, along with more robust induction of non-classical monocytes. In contrast, female patients mounted significantly more robust T cell activation than male patients during SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was sustained in old age. Importantly, we found that a poor T cell response negatively correlated with patients age and was predictive of worse disease outcome in male patients, but not in female patients. Conversely, higher innate immune cytokines in female patients associated with worse disease progression, but not in male patients. These findings reveal a possible explanation underlying observed sex biases in COVID-19, and provide important basis for the development of sex-based approach to the treatment and care of men and women with COVID-19.","Takahashi, T.; Wong, P.; Ellingson, M.; Lucas, C.; Klein, J.; Israelow, B.; Silva, J.; Oh, J.; Mao, T.; Tokuyama, M.; Lu, P.; Venkataraman, A.; Park, A.; Liu, F.; Meir, A.; Sun, J.; Wang, E.; Wyllie, A.

25298,Measuring Oxygen Access: lessons from health facility assessments in Nigeria,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted global oxygen system deficiencies and revealed gaps in how we understand and measure """"oxygen access"""". We present a case study on oxygen access from 58 health facilities in Lagos state, Nigeria. We found large differences in oxygen access between facilities (primary vs secondary, government vs private) and describe four key domains to consider when measuring oxygen access.

Use8/58 (14%) of facilities had a functional pulse oximeter for detecting hypoxaemia (low blood oxygen level) and guiding oxygen care. Oximeters were typically located in outpatient clinics (12/27, 44%), paediatric ward (6/27, 22%), or operating theatre (4/27, 15%), not suitable for children, and infrequently used.

Availability34/58 (59%) facilities had a functional source of oxygen available on the day of inspection, of which 31 (91%) facilities had it available in a single ward area, typically the operating theatre or maternity ward.

CostOxygen was free to patients at primary health centres, when available, but expensive in hospitals and private facilities, with the median cost for 2 days oxygen 13000 ($36 USD) and 27500 ($77 USD) naira, respectively.

Patient accessNo facilities were adequately equipped to meet minimum oxygen demands for patients. We were unable to determine the proportion of hypoxaemic patients who received oxygen therapy with available data.

We highlight the importance of a multi-faceted approach to measuring oxygen access that assesses access at the point-of-care, and ideally at the patient-level. We propose standard metrics to report oxygen access and describe how these can be integrated into routine health information systems and existing health facility assessment tools.

SUMMARY BOXO_LIOxygen access is poorly understood and the most commonly used metrics (e.g. presence of an oxygen source) do not correlate well with actual access to patients.
C_LIO_LIPulse oximetry use is a critical indicator for the quality of oxygen services and may be a reasonable reflection of oxygen coverage to patients with hypoxaemia.
C_LIO_LIOxygen, and pulse oximeter, availability must be assessed at the point-of-care in all major service delivery areas, as intra-facility oxygen distribution is highly inequitable.
C_LIO_LIMinimum functional requirements for oxygen sources must be assessed, as many oxygen concentrators and cylinders may be present without being in working order.

23588,Mean Vitamin D levels in 19 European Countries & COVID-19 Mortality over 10 months,"ObjectivesReports early in the epidemic linking low mean national Vitamin D level with increased COVID-19 death, and until recently little research on the impact of Vitamin D deficiency on severity of COVID-19, led to this update of the initial report studying mortality up to the end of January 2021.

Methods, Design and SettingCoronavirus pandemic data for 19 European countries were downloaded from Our World in Data, which was last updated on January 24, 2021. Data from March 21, 2020 to January 22, 2021 were included in the statistical analysis. Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean data were collected by literature review. Poisson mixed-effect model was used to model the data.

ResultsEuropean countries with Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean less than or equal to 50 have higher COVID-19 death rates as compared with European countries with Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean greater than 50, relative risk of 2.155 (95% CI: 1.068 - 4.347, p-value = 0.032). A statistically significant negative moderate Spearman rank correlation was observed between Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean and the number of COVID-19 deaths for each 14-day period during the COVID-19 pandemic time period.

ConclusionsThe observation of the significantly lower COVID-19 mortality rates in countries with lowest annual sun exposure but highest mean Vitamin-D (25)-HD levels provides support for more awareness and possible use of food fortification. The need to consider re-configuring vaccine strategy due to emergence of large number of COVID-19 variants and studies identifying poor responders to Vaccine provides an opportunity to undertake therapeutic randomized control trials to confirm these observations.

Strengths of this studyLarge number of different European populations studied with different policies of food fortification and different population Vitamin D levels

Ten months of longitudinal study during rise and fall and rise again of the epidemic

Limitations of this studyBased on population Vitamin D levels published before the beginning of the pandemic. Though there hasnt been a pan-European national/international health education initiative about Vitamin D and COVID-19 infection, it has been well covered in the media and could have resulted in changes, though probably minor, at the national level. Because there have been many differences in response to the pandemic in these countries, there could be other factors involved as well","Ahmad, A.; Heumann, C.; Ali, R.; Oliver, T.",2021-03-12,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.03.11.21253361,1,Tim Oliver,Barts Cancer Institute,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.11.21253361v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.11.21253361v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
12199,What factors influence symptom reporting during an emerging infectious disease outbreak? A rapid review of the evidence,"IntroductionDuring any emerging infectious disease outbreak, people with symptoms of the illness are often asked to report their symptoms to the health service in a timely manner, to facilitate contact tracing. Numerous factors may influence an individuals willingness to report these symptoms. Understanding these factors has become urgent during the COVID-19 pandemic.

ObjectiveTo determine which factors influence symptom reporting during an emerging infectious disease outbreak.

MethodsWe conducted a rapid review of the evidence. We included papers based on primary research; published in a peer-reviewed journal; written in English; included factors associated with symptom reporting or accessing healthcare; and related to a major public health incident involving an infectious disease outbreak.

Main resultsFive themes were identified as facilitators of symptom reporting or accessing healthcare: accurate and informative communication; symptom severity; concern about exposure; ease of access; and relationship with the healthcare provider. Seven themes were identified as barriers of symptom reporting or accessing healthcare: lack of knowledge; fear; stigmatization; invasion of privacy; low concern about symptoms; economics; and practicalities of attending a healthcare facility.

Discussion & ConclusionIf contract tracing services are to be effective, members of the public need to have the capability, opportunity and motivation to use them. The themes identified should be used to evaluate the information provided to the public about such a service, the routes of access, and the underlying policies relating to the service, in order to ensure that as many people as possible with relevant symptoms will make contact.","Carter, P.; Megnin-Viggars, O.; Rubin, G.

19846,COVID19 is a seasonal climate-driven disease across both hemispheres,"The role of climate in the population dynamics of COVID-19 remains poorly understood, and a true seasonal signature has remained elusive. Data from both hemispheres and the second wave provide opportunities to further examine climatic drivers. With a statistical method designed to detect transitory associations, we show consistent negative effects of temperature and absolute humidity at large spatial scales. At finer spatial resolutions we substantiate these connections during the seasonal rise and fall of COVID-19. Strong disease responses are identified between 12-18{degrees}C for Temperature and 4-12 g/m3 for Absolute Humidity. These results classify COVID-19 as a seasonal low-temperature infection, and point to the airborne pathway as an important contribution to transmission for SARS-CoV-2, with implications for control measures we discuss.","Fontal, A.; Bouma, M.

20364,Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Lineage B.1.1.7 in England: Insights from linking epidemiological and genetic data,"The SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, now designated Variant of Concern 202012/01 (VOC) by Public Health England, originated in the UK in late Summer to early Autumn 2020. We examine epidemiological evidence for this VOC having a transmission advantage from several perspectives. First, whole genome sequence data collected from community-based diagnostic testing provides an indication of changing prevalence of different genetic variants through time. Phylodynamic modelling additionally indicates that genetic diversity of this lineage has changed in a manner consistent with exponential growth. Second, we find that changes in VOC frequency inferred from genetic data correspond closely to changes inferred by S-gene target failures (SGTF) in community-based diagnostic PCR testing. Third, we examine growth trends in SGTF and non-SGTF case numbers at local area level across England, and show that the VOC has higher transmissibility than non-VOC lineages, even if the VOC has a different latent period or generation time. Available SGTF data indicate a shift in the age composition of reported cases, with a larger share of under 20 year olds among reported VOC than non-VOC cases.

Fourth, we assess the association of VOC frequency with independent estimates of the overall SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number through time. Finally, we fit a semi-mechanistic model directly to local VOC and non-VOC case incidence to estimate the reproduction numbers over time for each. There is a consensus among all analyses that the VOC has a substantial transmission advantage, with the estimated difference in reproduction numbers between VOC and non-VOC ranging between 0.4 and 0.7, and the ratio of reproduction numbers varying between 1.4 and 1.8. We note that these estimates of transmission advantage apply to a period where high levels of social distancing were in place in England; extrapolation to other transmission contexts therefore requires caution.","Volz, E.; Mishra, S.; Chand, M.; Barrett, J.

21917,Exponential increase in neutralizing and spike specific antibodies following vaccination of COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors,"BackgroundWith the recent approval of COVID-19 vaccines, recovered COVID-19 subjects who are vaccinated may be ideal candidates to donate COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP).

Case SeriesThree recovered COVID-19 patients were screened to donate CCP. All had molecularly confirmed COVID-19, and all were antibody positive by chemiluminescence immunoassay (DiaSorin) prior to vaccination. All were tested again for antibodies 11 to 21 days after they received the first dose of the vaccine (Pfizer). All showed dramatic increases ([~]50 fold) in spike-specific antibody levels and had at least a 20-fold increase in the IC50 neutralizing antibody titer based on plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT). The spike-specific antibody levels following vaccination were significantly higher than those seen in any non-vaccinated COVID-19 subjects tested to date at our facility.

ConclusionSpike-specific and neutralizing antibodies demonstrated dramatic increases following a single vaccination post COVID-19 infection which significantly exceeded values seen with COVID-19 infection alone. Recovered COVID-19 subjects who are vaccinated may make ideal candidates for CCP donation.","Vickers, M.; Sariol, A.; Leon, J.; Ehlers, A.; Locher, A.; Dubay, K.; Collins, L.; Voss, D.; Odle, A.; Holida, M.; Merrill, A.; Perlman, S.; Knudson, M.",2021-02-05,Allergy And Immunology,10.1101/2021.02.02.21250836,1,Mike Knudson,Universtiy of Iowa,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.02.21250836v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.02.21250836v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
9260,Changing patterns of mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic: population-based modelling to understand palliative care implications,"BackgroundCOVID-19 has directly and indirectly caused high mortality worldwide.

AimTo explore patterns of mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic and implications for palliative care provision, planning, and research.

DesignDescriptive analysis and population-based modelling of routine data.

Participants and settingAll deaths registered in England and Wales between 7th March and 15th May 2020. We described the following mortality categories by age, gender and place of death: 1) baseline deaths (deaths that would typically occur in a given period) 2) COVID-19 deaths 3) additional deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19. We estimated the proportion of COVID-19 deaths among people who would be in their last year of life in the absence of the pandemic, using simple modelling with explicit assumptions.

ResultsDuring the first 10 weeks of the pandemic there were 101,615 baseline deaths, 41,105 COVID-19 deaths and 14,520 additional deaths. Deaths in care homes increased by 220% compared to home and hospital deaths which increased by 77% and 90%. Hospice deaths fell by 20%. Additional deaths were among older people (86% aged [&ge;]75 years), and most occurred in care homes (56%) and at home (43%). We estimate that 44% (38% to 50%) of COVID-19 deaths occurred among people who would have been in their last year of life in the absence of the pandemic.

ConclusionsHealthcare systems must ensure availability of palliative care to support people with severe COVID-19 in community and hospital settings. Integrated models of palliative care in care homes are urgently needed.

4550,Impact of lockdown on COVID-19 epidemic in Ile-de-France and possible exit strategies,"BackgroundMore than half of the global population is under strict forms of social distancing. Estimating the expected impact of lockdown and exit strategies is critical to inform decision makers on the management of the COVID-19 health crisis.

MethodsWe use a stochastic age-structured transmission model integrating data on age profile and social contacts in Ile-de-France to (i) assess the epidemic in the region, (ii) evaluate the impact of lockdown, and (iii) propose possible exit strategies and estimate their effectiveness. The model is calibrated to hospital admission data before lockdown. Interventions are modeled by reconstructing the associated changes in the contact matrices and informed by mobility reductions during lockdown evaluated from mobile phone data. Different types and durations of social distancing are simulated, including progressive and targeted strategies, with large-scale testing.

ResultsWe estimate the reproductive number at 3.18 [3.09, 3.24] (95% confidence interval) prior to lockdown and at 0.68 [0.66, 0.69] during lockdown, thanks to an 81% reduction of the average number of contacts. Model predictions capture the disease dynamics during lockdown, showing the epidemic curve reaching ICU system capacity, largely strengthened during the emergency, and slowly decreasing. Results suggest that physical contacts outside households were largely avoided during lockdown. Lifting the lockdown with no exit strategy would lead to a second wave overwhelming the healthcare system, if conditions return to normal. Extensive case-finding and isolation are required for social distancing strategies to gradually relax lockdown constraints.

ConclusionsAs France experiences the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in lockdown, intensive forms of social distancing are required in the upcoming months due to the currently low population immunity. Extensive case-finding and isolation would allow the partial release of the socio-economic pressure caused by extreme measures, while avoiding healthcare demand exceeding capacity. Response planning needs to urgently prioritize the logistics and capacity for these interventions.","Di Domenico, L.; Pullano, G.; Sabbatini, C.

23493,COVID-19: Optimal Allocation of Ventilator Supply under Uncertainty and Risk,"This study presents a new risk-averse multi-stage stochastic epidemics-ventilator-logistics compartmental model to address the resource allocation challenges of mitigating COVID-19. This epidemiological logistics model involves the uncertainty of untested asymptomatic infections and incorporates short-term human migration. Disease transmission is also forecasted through a new formulation of transmission rates that evolve over space and time with respect to various non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and lockdown. The proposed multi-stage stochastic model overviews different scenarios on the number of asymptomatic individuals while optimizing the distribution of resources, such as ventilators, to minimize the total expected number of newly infected and deceased people. The Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is also incorporated into the multi-stage mean-risk model to allow for a trade-off between the weighted expected loss due to the outbreak and the expected risks associated with experiencing disastrous pandemic scenarios. We apply our multi-stage mean-risk epidemics-ventilator-logistics model to the case of controlling the COVID-19 in highly-impacted counties of New York and New Jersey. We calibrate, validate, and test our model using actual infection, population, and migration data. The results indicate that short-term migration influences the transmission of the disease significantly. The optimal number of ventilators allocated to each region depends on various factors, including the number of initial infections, disease transmission rates, initial ICU capacity, the population of a geographical location, and the availability of ventilator supply. Our data-driven modeling framework can be adapted to study the disease transmission dynamics and logistics of other similar epidemics and pandemics.","Yin, X.; Buyuktahtakin, I. E.; Patel, B.

3270,Prognostic factors for COVID-19 pneumonia progression to severe symptom based on the earlier clinical features: a retrospective analysis,"Approximately 15-20% of COVID-19 patients will develop severe pneumonia, about 10 % of which will die if not properly managed. Earlier discrimination of the potential severe patients basing on routine clinical and laboratory changes and commencement of prophylactical management will not only save their lives but also mitigate the otherwise overwhelmed health care burden. In this retrospective investigation, the clinical and laboratory features were collected from 125 COVID-19 patients, who were classified into mild (93 cases) or severe (32 cases) groups according to their clinical outcomes after 3 to 7-days post-admission. The subsequent analysis with single-factor and multivariate logistic regression methods indicated that 17 factors on admission differed significantly between mild and severe groups, but that only comorbid with underlying diseases, increased respiratory rate (>24/min), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP >10mg/liter), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH >250U/liter), were independently associated with the later disease development. Finally, we evaluated their prognostic values with the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis and found that the above four factors could not confidently predict the occurrence of severe pneumonia individually, but that a combination of fast respiratory rate and elevated LDH significantly increased the predictive confidence (AUC= 0.944, sensitivity= 0.941, and specificity= 0.902). A combination consisting of 3- or 4-factors could further increase the prognostic value. Additionally, measurable serum viral RNA post-admission independently predicted the severe illness occurrence. In conclusion, a combination of general clinical characteristics and laboratory tests could provide high confident prognostic value for identifying potential severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients.

SummaryWith our successful experience of treating COVID-19 patients, we retrospectively found that routine clinical features could reliably predict severe pneumonia development, thus provide quick and affordable references for physicians to save the otherwise fatal patients with the limited medical resource.","Huang, H.; Cai, S.; Li, Y.; Li, Y.; Fan, Y.; Li, L.; Lei, C.; Tang, X.; Hu, F.; Li, F.; Deng, X.",2020-03-30,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.28.20045989,1,Feng Li,Guangzhou Eighth People\'s Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20045989v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20045989v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3389/fmed.2020.557453
9350,"Exploring the correlation between COVID-19 fatalities and poor WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) services","Access to safe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) services have been recognized as a highly precautionary measure essential to protecting human health during this COVID-19 outbreak. However, it is currently unknown whether poor or non-availability of these services are also closely related to COVID-19 fatalities. We analysed the latest data on COVID-19 fatality rates in Sub Saharan Africa with indicators of safe water and sanitation governance to test this hypothesis. We found a strong correlation between a higher case fatality rate and poorer access to safe drinking water as well as safe sanitation. The Pearson correlation is stronger for access to safe sanitation (-0.30) compared to access to safe drinking water (-0.20). The Chad, Niger and Sierra Leone were amongst the countries with the highest fatality rates (>6.0) and also had particularly poor access to safe drinking water (<34%) and safe sanitation (<22%). The hypothesis of an association between COVID-19 fatalities and poor access to water and sanitation was confirmed by this study. However, our analysis does not establish causality. Given the increase spread of COVID-19 and related deaths, this analysis serves as an important reminder that safe water and sanitation services are key for public health interventions and highlights the need to prioritise this sector in all economies.","Amankwaa, G.; Fischer, C.",2020-06-09,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.06.08.20125864,1,Godfred Amankwaa,University of Manchester,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.08.20125864v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.08.20125864v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA

Mathematical modeling of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) of COVID-19 in Kenya is presented. An SEIR compartment model is considered with additional compartments of hospitalized population whose condition is severe or critical and also the fatalities compartment. The basic reproduction number (R0) is computed by next generation matrix approach and later expressed as a time-dependent function so as to incorporate the NPIs into the model. The resulting system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are solved using fourth-order and fifth-order Runge-Kutta methods. Different intervention scenarios are considered and results show that, implementation of closure of education insitutions, curfew and partial lockdown yield predicted delayed peaks of the overall infections, severe cases and fatalities and subsequently containement of the pandemic in the country.","Gathungu, D.

22398,The rise of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in Israel intensifies the role of surveillance and vaccination in elderly,"Since the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic various generic variants have been described. Of specific interest is a new variant, which was observed in England during December 2020 and is now termed B.1.1.7. This variant is now associated with increased infectivity and therefore its spread within the community is of great importance. The Israeli government established three noteworthy programs namely, mass PCR testing, focused protection of the elderly and more recently an unparalleled prioritized vaccination program. In this study we analyzed primary data of >300,000 RT-PCR samples collected throughout December 6th 2020 until February 10th 2021 in the general community and nursing homes. We identified that within a period of six weeks, the B.1.1.7 variant was capable of out competing the wildtype SARS-CoV-2 strain to become the main strain. Furthermore, we show that the transmission of B.1.1.7 in the 60+ population reached a near complete halt, due to an ongoing surveillance testing program in nursing homes and the vaccination program of Israel. Thus, proactive protection programs such as routine surveillance and monitoring of populations at risk combined with prioritized vaccination, is achievable and will result in a reduction of severe illness and subsequent death.","Munitz, A.; Yechezkel, M.; Dickstein, Y.; Yamin, D.; Gerlic, M.",2021-02-19,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.02.16.21251819,1,Motti Gerlic,"Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 6997801 Israel",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.16.21251819v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.16.21251819v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.xcrm.2021.100264
17855,What support do frontline workers want? A qualitative study of health and social care workers experiences and views of psychosocial support during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has placed a significant burden on the mental health and wellbeing of frontline health and social care workers. The need to support frontline staff has been recognised. However, there is to date little research specifically on how best to support the mental health needs of frontline workers, and none on their own experiences and views about what might be most helpful.

AimsWe set out to redress this research gap by qualitatively exploring UK frontline health and social care workers own experiences and views of psychosocial support during the pandemic.

MethodFrontline health and social care workers were recruited purposively through social media and by snowball sampling via healthcare colleagues. Workers who volunteered to take part in the study were interviewed remotely following a semi-structured interview guide. Transcripts of the interviews were analysed by the research team following the principles of Reflexive Thematic Analysis.

ResultsWe conducted 25 interviews with frontline workers from a variety of professional groups working in health and social care settings across the UK. Themes derived from our analysis showed that workers experiences and views about psychosocial support were complex. Peer support was many workers first line of support but could also be experienced as a burden. Workers were ambivalent about support shown by organisations, media and the public. Whilst workers valued psychological support services, there were many disparities in provision and barriers to access.

ConclusionsThe results of this study show that frontline health and social care workers are likely to need a flexible system of support including peer, organisational and professional support.

22614,The Association of Opening K-12 Schools and Colleges with the Spread of COVID-19 in the United States: County-Level Panel Data Analysis,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThis paper empirically examines how the opening of K-12 schools and colleges is associated with the spread of COVID-19 using county-level panel data in the United States. Using data on foot traffic and K-12 school opening plans, we analyze how an increase in visits to schools and opening schools with different teaching methods (in-person, hybrid, and remote) is related to the 2-weeks forward growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Our debiased panel data regression analysis with a set of county dummies, interactions of state and week dummies, and other controls shows that an increase in visits to both K-12 schools and colleges is associated with a subsequent increase in case growth rates. The estimates indicate that fully opening K-12 schools with in-person learning is associated with a 5 (SE = 2) percentage points increase in the growth rate of cases. We also find that the positive association of K-12 school visits or in-person school openings with case growth is stronger for counties that do not require staff to wear masks at schools. These results have a causal interpretation in a structural model with unobserved county and time confounders. Sensitivity analysis shows that the baseline results are robust to timing assumptions and alternative specifications.","Chernozhukov, V.; Kasahara, H.; Schrimpf, P.",2021-02-23,Health Economics,10.1101/2021.02.20.21252131,1,Hiroyuki Kasahara,University of British Columbia,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.20.21252131v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.20.21252131v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
15329,The impact of vital signs on the death of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Assessing the impact of vital signs (blood pressure, body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) on the death of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia would provide a simple and convenient method for the monitoring of subsequent illness, and therefore, in some degree reduce treatment costs and increase the cure rate clinically. Methods: Six databases were retrieved. The software R 3.6.2 was used for meta-analysis of the included literature. Results: 12 studies were included, which comprise 8996 patients affected with COVID-19 infection. The meta-analysis study found that blood pressure (MAP, SBP and DBP), heart rate, respiration rate and SpO2 are the risk factors for disease progression in patients with COVID-19. Among them, the increase in MAP and the decrease in SpO2 have the greatest impact on the death of patients with COVID-19 [MAP: MD = 5.66, 95% CI (0.34, 10.98), SpO2: MD = -5.87, 95% CI (-9.17, -2.57), P = 0.0005]. However, comparing the body temperature of the death group and the survival group found that the body temperature was not statistically significant between the two groups [body temperature: MD = 0.21, 95% CI (-0.01, 0.43), P = 0.0661]. Conclusion: The increase in MAP, heart rate and respiratory rate, as well as the decrease in SBP, DBP and SpO2 are all independent risk factors for death in patients with COVID-19. These factors are simple and easy to monitor, and individualized treatment can be given to patients in time, reducing the mortality rate and improving treatment efficiency.","Du, M.; Zhao, J.; Yin, X.; Zhang, N.; Zheng, G.",2020-09-18,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.09.17.20196709,1,Xiaochun Yin,"School of public health, Gansu university of Chinese medicine, Gansu Lanzhou 730000, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.17.20196709v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.17.20196709v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
17916,Seasonal human coronavirus antibodies are boosted upon SARS-CoV-2 infection but not associated with protection,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread within the human population. Although SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, most humans had been previously exposed to other antigenically distinct common seasonal human coronaviruses (hCoVs) before the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we quantified levels of SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies and hCoV-reactive antibodies in serum samples collected from 204 humans before the COVID-19 pandemic. We then quantified pre-pandemic antibody levels in serum from a separate cohort of 252 individuals who became PCR-confirmed infected with SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we longitudinally measured hCoV and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the serum of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Our studies indicate that most individuals possessed hCoV-reactive antibodies before the COVID-19 pandemic. We determined that [~]23% of these individuals possessed non-neutralizing antibodies that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins. These antibodies were not associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2 infections or hospitalizations, but paradoxically these hCoV cross-reactive antibodies were boosted upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Anderson, E.

19290,Lipid storm within the lungs of severe COVID-19 patients: Extensive levels of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase-derived inflammatory metabolites.,"BACKGROUNDSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the infectious agent responsible for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While SARS-CoV-2 infections are often benign, there are also severe COVID-19 cases, characterized by severe bilobar pneumonia that can decompensate to an acute respiratory distress syndrome, notably characterized by increased inflammation and a cytokine storm. While there is no cure against severe COVID-19 cases, some treatments significantly decrease the severity of the disease, notably aspirin and dexamethasone, which both directly or indirectly target the biosynthesis (and effects) of numerous bioactive lipids.

OBJECTIVEOur working hypothesis was that severe COVID-19 cases necessitating mechanical ventilation were characterized by increased bioactive lipid levels modulating lung inflammation. We thus quantitated several lung bioactive lipids using liquid chromatography combined to tandem mass spectrometry.

RESULTSWe performed an exhaustive assessment of the lipid content of bronchoalveolar lavages from 25 healthy controls and 33 COVID-19 patients necessitating mechanical ventilation. Severe COVID-19 patients were characterized by increased fatty acid levels as well as an accompanying inflammatory lipid storm. As such, most quantified bioactive lipids were heavily increased. There was a predominance of cyclooxygenase metabolites, notably TXB2 >> PGE2 [~] 12-HHTrE > PGD2. Leukotrienes were also increased, notably LTB4, 20-COOH-LTB4, LTE4, and eoxin E4. 15-lipoxygenase metabolites derived from linoleic, arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids were also increased. Finally, yet importantly, specialized pro-resolving mediators, notably lipoxin A4 and the D-series resolvins, were also found at important levels, underscoring that the lipid storm occurring in severe SARS-CoV-2 infections involves pro- and anti-inflammatory lipids.

CONCLUSIONSOur data unmask the important lipid storm occurring in the lungs of patients afflicted with severe COVID-19. We discuss which clinically available drugs could be helpful at modulating the lipidome we observed in the hope of minimizing the deleterious effects of pro-inflammatory lipids and enhancing the effects of anti-inflammatory and/or pro-resolving lipids.","Archambault, A.-S.; Zaid, Y.; Rakotoarivelo, V.; Dore, E.; Dubuc, I.; Martin, C.; Amar, Y.; Cheikh, A.; Fares, H.; El Hassani, A.; Tijani, Y.; Laviolette, M.; Boilard, E.; Flamand, L.; Flamand, N.",2020-12-07,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.12.04.20242115,1,Nicolas Flamand,"Centre de recherche de l\'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Quebec - Universite Laval, Faculty of medicine, Quebec City, Canada",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.04.20242115v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.04.20242115v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
17943,A shorter symptom-onset to remdesivir treatment (SORT) interval is associated with a lower mortality in moderate-to-severe COVID-19: A real-world analysis,"BackgroundRemdesivir is the current recommended anti-viral treatment in moderate-to-severe COVID-19. However, data on several aspects of its use such as impact of timing of therapy, efficacy, and safety in this severity category are limited. The current study aimed to evaluate the impact of timing of remdesivir initiation (symptom-onset to remdesivir treatment [SORT] interval) on in-hospital all-cause mortality in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19.

MethodsThis retrospective study was conducted between June 25, 2020 and October 3, 2020, at a tertiary care dedicated COVID center in India. Consecutive patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 (moderate: SpO2 <94%; severe: SpO2 <90%) were included. Data were collected from the health records of the hospital. Remdesivir was administered along with other standard medications as per protocol. The main outcome was the impact of SORT interval on in-hospital all-cause mortality. Subgroups were formed based on SORT interval. Other measures analyzed included overall in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, and safety.

ResultsOf 350 patients treated with remdesivir, 346 were included for the final analysis (males: 270 [78.0%]; median [range] age: 60 [24-94] years). Overall, 243 (70.2%) patients had [&ge;]1 comorbidity; 109 (31.5%) patients had moderate disease, 237 (68.5%) had severe disease, and 50 (14.5%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Of the 346 patients, 76 (22.0%) patients died (moderate: 3 [2.8%], severe: 73 [30.8%]). In the subset of mechanically ventilated patients, 43 (86.0%) died. All-cause mortality was significantly lower in patients with SORT interval [&le;]9 days (n = 260) compared with those with SORT interval >9 days (n = 86; 18.1% vs 33.7%; P = .004). The odds of death were significantly lower in patients with SORT interval [&le;]9 days vs >9 days (odds ratio = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.25-0.76; P = .004). Adverse events (transaminitis [&ge;]5 times upper limit of normal or estimated glomerular filtration rate <30ml/min) leading to drug discontinuation were seen in 4 (1.1%) patients.

ConclusionIn this large series of moderate-to-severe COVID-19, initiation of remdesivir [&le;]9 days from symptom-onset was associated with a significant mortality benefit. These findings indicate a treatment window and reinforce the need for earlier remdesivir initiation in moderate-to-severe COVID-19 infection.","Mehta, R.

We used EpiEstim R package to investigate the time-varying reproduction numbers of the COVID-19 in the four most affected regions in South Korea: Seoul, Gyeonggi Province, Gyeongbuk Province, and Daegu. At the regional level, Seoul and Gyeonggi Province have experienced two waves with the first major peak of COVID-19 in early March, followed by the second wave in the first two weeks of June, with reproduction numbers in early May greater than 3.0.

Gyeongbuk Province and Daegu are yet to experience a second wave of the disease, where the mean reproduction number reached values as high as 3.5-4.4.

7054,Triage tool for suspected COVID-19 patients in the emergency room: AIFELL score,"Clinical prediction scores support the assessment of patients in the emergency setting to determine the need for further diagnostic and therapeutic steps. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, physicians in emergency rooms (ER) of many hospitals have a considerably higher patient load and need to decide within a short time frame whom to hospitalize. Based on our clinical experiences in dealing with COVID-19 patients at the University Hospital Zurich, we created a triage score with the acronym AIFELL consisting of clinical, radiological and laboratory findings.

The score was then evaluated in a retrospective analysis of 122 consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19 from March until mid-April 2020. Descriptive statistics, Students t-test, ANOVA and Scheffes post hoc analysis confirmed the diagnostic power of the score. The results suggest that the AIFELL score has potential as a triage tool in the ER setting intended to select probable COVID-19 cases for hospitalization in spontaneously presenting or referred patients with acute respiratory symptoms.","Levenfus, I.; Ullmann, E.; Battegay, E.; Schuurmans, M.

9584,Comorbidity and Sociodemographic determinants in COVID-19 Mortality in an US Urban Healthcare System,"BackgroundNew York City is the US epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Early international data indicated that comorbidity contributes significantly to poor prognosis and fatality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. It is not known to what degree medical comorbidity and sociodemographic determinants impact COVID-19 mortality in the US.

MethodsEvaluation of de-identified electronic health records of 7,592 COVID-19 patients confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 lab tests in New York City. Medical comorbidites and outcome of mortality, and other covariates, including clinical, sociodemographic, and medication measures were assessed by bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models.

ResultsOf common comorbid conditions (hypertension, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, obesity, diabetes, HIV, cancer), when adjusted for covariates, chronic kidney disease remained significantly associated with increased odds of mortality. Patients who had more than one comorbidities, former smokers, treated with Azithromycin without Hydroxychloroquine, reside within the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens Higher had higher odds of death.

ConclusionsIncreasing numbers of comorbid factors increase COVID-19 mortality, but several clinical and sociodemographic factors can mitigate risk. Continued evaluation of COVID-19 in large diverse populations is important to characterize individuals at risk and improve clinical outcomes.","Wang, A.-L.; Zhong, X.; Hurd, Y.",2020-06-12,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.11.20128926,1,An-Li Wang,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT Mount Sinai,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.11.20128926v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.11.20128926v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
4257,"COVID-19 pandemics modeling with SEIR(+CAQH), social distancing, and age stratification. The effect of vertical confinement and release in Brazil.","The ongoing COVID-19 epidemics poses a particular challenge to low and middle income countries, making some of them consider the strategy of """"vertical confinement"""". In this strategy, contact is reduced only to specific groups (like age groups) that are at increased risk of severe disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aim to assess the feasibility of this scenario as an exit strategy for the current lockdown in terms of its ability to keep the number of cases under the health care system capacity. We developed a modified SEIR model, including confinement, asymptomatic transmission, quarantine and hospitalization. The population is subdivided into 9 age groups, resulting in a system of 72 coupled nonlinear differential equations. The rate of transmission is dynamic and derived from the observed delayed fatality rate; the parameters of the epidemics are derived with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We used Brazil as an example of middle income country, but the results are easily generalizable to other countries considering a similar strategy. We find that starting from 60% horizontal confinement, an exit strategy on May 1st of confinement of individuals older than 60 years old and full release of the younger population results in 400 000 hospitalizations, 50 000 ICU cases, and 120 000 deaths in the 50-60 years old age group alone. The health care system avoids collapse if the 50-60 years old are also confined, but our model assumes an idealized lockdown where the confined are perfectly insulated from contamination, so our numbers are a conservative lower bound. Our results discourage confinement by age as an exit strategy.","Lyra, W.; Do Nascimento, J. D.; Belkhiria, J.; De Almeida, L.; Chrispim, P.

22544,Patient prioritisation methods to shorten waiting times for elective surgery: a systematic review of how to improve access to surgery,"BackgroundConcern about long waiting times for elective surgeries is not a recent phenomenon, but it has been heightened by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated measures. One way to alleviate the problem might be to use prioritisation methods for patients on the waiting list and a wide range of research is available on such methods. However, significant variations and inconsistencies have been reported in prioritisation protocols from various specialties, institutions, and health systems. To bridge the evidence gap in existing literature, this comprehensive systematic review will synthesise global evidence on policy strategies with a unique insight to patient prioritisation methods to reduce waiting times for elective surgeries. This will provide evidence that might help with the tremendous burden of surgical disease that is now apparent in many countries because of operations that were delayed or cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and inform policy for sustainable healthcare management systems.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, with our most recent searches in January 2020. Articles published after 2013 on major elective surgery lists of adult patients were eligible, but cancer and cancer-related surgeries were excluded. Both randomised and non-randomised studies were eligible and the quality of studies was assessed with ROBINS-I and CASP tools. We registered the review in PROSPERO (CRD42019158455) and reported it in accordance with the PRISMA statement.

ResultsThe electronic search in five bibliographic databases yielded 7543 records (PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Cochrane) and 17 eligible articles were identified in the screening. There were four quasi-experimental studies, 11 observational studies and two systematic reviews. These demonstrated moderate to low risk of bias in their research methods. Three studies tested generic approaches using common prioritisation systems for all elective surgeries in common. The other studies assessed specific prioritisation approaches for re-ordering the waiting list for a particular surgical specialty.

ConclusionsExplicit prioritisation tools with a standardised scoring system based on clear evidence-based criteria are likely to reduce waiting times and improve equitable access to health care. Multiple attributes need to be considered in defining a fair prioritisation system to overcome limitations with local variations and discriminations. Collating evidence from a diverse body of research provides a single framework to improve the quality and efficiency of elective surgical care provision in a variety of health settings. Universal prioritisation tools with vertical and horizontal equity would help with re-ordering patients on waiting lists for elective surgery and reduce waiting times.","Rathnayake, D.; Clarke, M.; Jayasinghe, V.",2021-02-21,Health Systems And Quality Improvement,10.1101/2021.02.18.21252033,1,Dimuthu Rathnayake,Queen\'s University Belfast,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.18.21252033v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.18.21252033v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

5397,"Performing risk stratification for COVID-19 when individual level data is not available, the experience of a large healthcare organization","With the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is an urgent need for risk stratification tools to support prevention and treatment decisions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) listed several criteria that define high-risk individuals, but multivariable prediction models may allow for a more accurate and granular risk evaluation. In the early days of the pandemic, when individual level data required for training prediction models was not available, a large healthcare organization developed a prediction model for supporting its COVID-19 policy using a hybrid strategy. The model was constructed on a baseline predictor to rank patients according to their risk for severe respiratory infection or sepsis (trained using over one-million patient records) and was then post-processed to calibrate the predictions to reported COVID-19 case fatality rates. Since its deployment in mid-March, this predictor was integrated into many decision-processes in the organization that involved allocating limited resources. With the accumulation of enough COVID-19 patients, the predictor was validated for its accuracy in predicting COVID-19 mortality among all COVID-19 cases in the organization (3,176, 3.1% death rate). The predictor was found to have good discrimination, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve of 0.942. Calibration was also good, with a marked improvement compared to the calibration of the baseline model when evaluated for the COVID-19 mortality outcome. While the CDC criteria identify 41% of the population as high-risk with a resulting sensitivity of 97%, a 5% absolute risk cutoff by the model tags only 14% to be at high-risk while still achieving a sensitivity of 90%. To summarize, we found that even in the midst of a pandemic, shrouded in epidemiologic """"fog of war"""" and with no individual level data, it was possible to provide a useful predictor with good discrimination and calibration.","Barda, N.; Riesel, D.; Akriv, A.; Levi, J.; Finkel, U.; Yona, G.; Greenfeld, D.; Sheiba, S.; Somer, J.; Bachmat, E.; Rothblum, G.

25248,The Mental Health Under the COVID-19 Crisis in Africa: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"ObjectiveIn this paper, we aim to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence rates of mental health symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia among the major populations during the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa.

DesignA systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesWe search and include articles using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and medRxiv databases between Feb 202 and Feb 6th, 2021.

Eligibility criteria and data analysisThe meta-analysis targets the prevalence rates of mental health symptoms of major populations including frontline/general healthcare workers (HCWs), the general adult population, and medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa. To estimate the prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, and insomnia, we pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses.

ResultsIn this meta-analysis, we identify and include 28 studies and 32 independent samples from 12 countries with a total of 15,072 participants in Africa. Ethiopia (7) and Egypt (6) had the largest number of studies. While many countries including, but not limited to, Algeria, Kenya, and Ghana had a high number of COVID-19 cases, as many as three quarters of African countries have no studies. The pooled prevalence of anxiety in 27 studies was 37% (95%CI: 31-43%, I2 = 99.0%) and that of depression in 24 studies was 45% (95%CI: 36-51%, I2 = 99.5%) and that of insomnia in 9 studies was 28% (95%CI: 20-41%, I2 = 99.2%). The pooled prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in North Africa (44%, 55%, and 31%, respectively) are higher than the rates in Sub-Saharan Africa (31%, 30%, and 24%, respectively). Our analysis indicated high heterogeneity and varying prevalence rates of mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa.

DiscussionWe discuss our findings that a) a scarcity of studies in several African countries with a high number of COVID-19 cases, b) high heterogeneity among the studies, c) the extent of prevalence of mental health symptoms in Africa to be high, and d) the pattern of mental health symptoms in Africa differs from elsewhere, i.e., more African adults suffer from depression rather than anxiety and insomnia during COVID 19 compared to adult population in other countries or regions. Hence, our findings carry crucial implications for healthcare organizations and future research to enable evidence-based medicine in Africa. Our findings also call for increased scholarly attention on Africa, the least studied continent with a limited amount of research on mental health symptoms under the COVID 19 pandemic.

7136,Differential Redistribution of Activated Monocyte and Dendritic Cell Subsets to the Lung Associates with Severity of COVID-19,"The SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the pandemic COVID-19 in infected individuals, who can either exhibit mild symptoms or progress towards a life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is known that exacerbated inflammation and dysregulated immune responses involving T and myeloid cells occur in COVID-19 patients with severe clinical progression. However, the differential contribution of specific subsets of dendritic cells and monocytes to ARDS is still poorly understood. In addition, the role of CD8+ T cells present in the lung of COVID-19 patients and relevant for viral control has not been characterized. With the aim to improve the knowledge in this area, we developed a cross-sectional study, in which we have studied the frequencies and activation profiles of dendritic cells and monocytes present in the blood of COVID-19 patients with different clinical severity in comparison with healthy control individuals. Furthermore, these subpopulations and their association with antiviral effector CD8+ T cell subsets were also characterized in lung infiltrates from critical COVID-19 patients. Collectively, our results suggest that inflammatory transitional and non-classical monocytes preferentially migrate from blood to lungs in patients with severe COVID-19. CD1c+ conventional dendritic cells also followed this pattern, whereas CD141+ conventional and CD123hi plasmacytoid dendritic cells were depleted from blood but were absent in the lungs. Thus, this study increases the knowledge on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease and could be useful for the design of therapeutic strategies to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection.

4349,Time-Varying COVID-19 Reproduction Number in the United States,"The basic reproduction number is the average number of people to whom an infected person transmits the infection when virtually all individuals in a population are susceptible. We sought to calculate the current reproduction number for COVID-19 for each state in the United States. For the entire United States, the time-varying reproduction number declined from 4.02 to 1.51 between March 17 and April 1, 2020. We also found that the time-varying reproduction number for COVID-19 has declined in most states over the same two week period which suggests that social isolation measures may be having a beneficial effect.","Gunzler, D.; Sehgal, A.

2151,A simple ecological model captures the transmission pattern of the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak in China,"The rapid spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), initially reported in the city of Wuhan in China, and quickly transmitted to the entire nation and beyond, has become an international public health emergency. Estimating the final number of infection cases and the turning point (time with the fastest spreading rate) is crucial to assessing and improving the national and international control measures currently being applied. In this paper we develop a simple model based on infectious growth with a time-varying infection rate, and estimate the final number of infections and the turning point using data updated daily from 3 February 2020, when China escalated its initial public health measures, to 10 February. Our model provides an extremely good fit to the existing data and therefore a reasonable estimate of the time-varying infection rate that has largely captured the transmission pattern of this epidemic outbreak. Our estimation suggests that (i) the final number of infections in China could reach 78,000 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 88,880; (ii) the turning point of the fastest spread was on the 4th or the 5th of February; and (iii) the projected period for the end of the outbreak (i.e., when 95% of the final predicted number of infection is reached) will be the 24th of February, with an upper 95% confidence limit on the 19th of March. This suggests that the current control measures in China are excellent, and more than sufficient to contain the spread of this highly infectious novel coronavirus, and that the application of such measures could be considered internationally for the global control of this outbreak.","Zhang, F.; Zhang, J.; Cao, M.; Hui, C.",2020-02-29,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.02.27.20028928,1,Feng Zhang,Anhui University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028928v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028928v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
14908,Exhaled CO2 as COVID-19 infection risk proxy for different indoor environments and activities,"CO2 is co-exhaled with aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2 by COVID-19 infected people and can be used as a proxy of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations indoors. Indoor CO2 measurements by low-cost sensors hold promise for mass monitoring of indoor aerosol transmission risk for COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases. We derive analytical expressions of CO2-based risk proxies and apply them to various typical indoor environments. The relative infection risk in a given environment scales with excess CO2 level, and thus keeping CO2 as low as feasible in a space allows optimizing the protection provided by ventilation. We show that the CO2 level corresponding to a given absolute infection risk varies by over 2 orders of magnitude for different environments and activities. Although large uncertainties, mainly from virus exhalation rates, are still associated with infection risk estimates, our study provides more specific and practical recommendations for low-cost CO2-based indoor infection risk monitoring.

4045,"Know Your Epidemic, Know Your Response: Covid-19 in the United States","We document that during the week of March 10-16, the Covid-19 pandemic fundamentally affected the perceptions of U.S. residents about the health risks and socioeconomic consequences entailed by the pandemic. During this week, it seems, """"everything changed."""" Not only did the pandemic progress rapidly across the United States, but U.S. residents started to realize that the threat was real: increasing Covid-19 caseloads heightened perceptions of infection risks and excess mortality risks, concerns about the economic implications increased substantially, and behavioral responses became widespread as the pandemic expanded rapidly in the U.S. In early to mid-March 2020, average perceptions about the coronavirus infection risks are broadly consistent with projections about the pandemic, while expectations about dying conditional on infection and expectations about Covid-19-related excess mortality during the next months are possibly too pessimistic. However, some aspects of Covid-19 perceptions are disconcerting from the perspective of implementing and sustaining an effective societal response to the pandemic. For instance, the education gradient in expected infection risks entails the possibility of having different perceptions of the reality of the pandemic between people with and without a college education, potentially resulting in two different levels of behavioral and policy-responses across individuals and regions. Unless addressed by effective health communication that reaches individuals across all social strata, some of the misperceptions about Covid-19 epidemic raise concerns about the ability of the United States to implement and sustain the widespread and harsh policies that are required to curtail the pandemic. Our analyses also reveal perceptions of becoming infected with the virus, and dying from Covid-19, were driven upwards by a rapidly increasing national caseload, and perceptions of the economic consequences and the adaptation of social distancing were affected by both national and state-level cases.","Ciancio, A.; Kämpfen, F.; Kohler, I.

24717,Effect of Tocilizumab on ventilator free days composite outcome in SARS-CoV-2 patients. A retrospective competing risk analysis.,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrates a wide range of severity, the more severe cases demonstrate a cytokine storm with elevated serum interleukin-6, hence IL-6 receptor antibody Tocilizumab was tried for the management of severe cases.

ObjectivesThe effect of Tocilizumab treatment on the composite outcome of ventilator free days, among critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients.

MethodRetrospective observational propensity score matching study, comparing mechanically ventilated patients upon ICU admission who received Tocilizumab to a control group. Utilizing competing risk analysis method, and reporting sub-distributional hazard ratio of a composite outcome of ventilator free days at day 28.

Results29 patients in the intervention group were compared to 29 patients in the control group. Matched groups were similar at base line. The primary outcome of ventilator free days was higher in the intervention group (SHR 2.7, 95% CI: 1.2 - 6.3; p = 0.02), crude ICU mortality rate was not different between Tocilizumab and control groups (37.9% versus 62% respectively, p = 0.1), actual ventilator free days were significantly longer in Tocilizumab group (mean difference 4.7 days, 95% CI 1.1 - 8.3; p = 0.02). Sensitivity analysis by Cox regression showed a significantly lower hazard ratio of death in Tocilizumab group (HR 0.49, 95% CI: 0.25 - 0.97; p = 0.04). While there was no difference in grown positive cultures among groups (55.2% in Tocilizumab group versus 34.5% in the control, 95% CI of difference: -7.11% to 54.4%; p = 0.1).

ConclusionTocilizumab may improve the composite outcome of ventilator free days at day 28 among mechanically ventilated SARS-CoV-2 patients, it is associated with significantly longer actual ventilator free days, and insignificantly lower mortality and superinfection.","Mady, A.

22030,Modelling the impact of contact tracing of symptomatic individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic,"OBJECTIVESWith declining numbers of COVID-19 cases in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, social distancing measures were gradually being lifted. The risk of an increase in the number of cases, however, cannot be overlooked. Even with the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as restrictions on mass gatherings, wearing masks, and complete or partial closure of schools, other public health measures may help to control the epidemic. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the contact tracing of symptomatic individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic regardless of the use of diagnostic testing.

METHODSWe developed a mathematical model that includes isolation of symptomatic individuals and tracing of contacts to assess the effects of the contact tracing of symptomatic individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic in the State of Sao Paulo.

RESULTSFor a selection efficacy (proportion of isolated contacts who are infected) of 80%, cases and deaths may be reduced by 80% after 60 days when 5000 symptomatic individuals are isolated per day, each of them together with 10 contacts. On the other hand, for a selection efficacy of 20%, the number of cases and deaths may be reduced by approximately 40% and 50%, respectively, compared with the scenario in which no contact tracing strategy is performed.

CONCLUSIONContact tracing of symptomatic individuals may be a potential alternative strategy when the number of diagnostic tests available is not sufficient for a massive testing strategy.","Amaku, M.; Covas, D.

25706,Objective and Subjective COVID-19 Vaccine Reactogenicity by Age and Vaccine Manufacturer,"Several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been granted emergency use authorization from the United States Food and Drug Administration and similar regulatory bodies abroad to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. While these vaccines have been shown to be extremely safe, transient side-effects lasting 24-48 hours post-vaccination have been reported. Here we conducted a retrospective analysis of 50977 subscribers to the WHOOP platform (33119 males, 17858 females; total of 65686 unique responses) who received either the AstraZeneca (AZ, n=2093), Janssen/Johnson & Johnson (J&J&J, n=3888), Moderna (n=23776; M1, 14553 first dose; M2, 9223 second dose), or Pfizer/BioNTech (n=35929; P&B1, 22387 first dose; P&B2, 13542 second dose) vaccines using data collected through April 14, 2021. Subjective reactogenicity was assessed using self-reported surveys. Results from these surveys indicated that the odds of self-reporting an adverse event after vaccination depend on gender, age, and manufacturer. Objectively measured cardiovascular (resting heart rate, RHR; heart rate variability, HRV) and sleep (total sleep duration, % light sleep, and % restorative sleep [a combination of REM and slow wave sleep]) metrics were assessed using a wrist-worn biometric device (Whoop Inc, Boston, MA, USA) and compared to the same day of the week, one week prior. Data are presented as a percent change from baseline {+/-} 95% confidence intervals. On the night after vaccination, RHR was higher (AZ: 13.5{+/-}0.76%; J&J&J: 16.5{+/-}0.64%; M1: 2.86{+/-}0.19%; M2: 9.3{+/-}0.53%; P&B1: 1.18{+/-}0.14%; P&B2: 13.5{+/-}0.36%) and HRV (AZ: -21.8{+/-}1.47%; J&J&J: - 25.6{+/-}1.15%; M1: -4.8{+/-}055%; M2: -19.9{+/-}1.33%; P&B1: -1.7{+/-}0.45%; P&B2: 8.60{+/-}1.10%) was lower than baseline levels. As for sleep metrics, total sleep was lower after the AZ and J&J&J vaccines (AZ: -3.7{+/-}0.98%; J&J&J: -3.8{+/-}0.80%; M1: 0.94{+/-}0.32%; M2: 0.14{+/-}0.80%; P&B1: 1.10{+/-}0.25%; P&B2: 0.35{+/-}0.63%); for AZ, J&J&J and the second dose of Moderna and P&B, a greater percentage of sleep post-vaccination came from light sleep (AZ: 9.24{+/-}1.22%; J&J&J: 13.8{+/-}1.02%; M1: 1.73{+/-}0.40%; M2: 8.02{+/-}0.99%; P&B1: 0.44{+/-}0.31%; P&B2: 2.54{+/-}0.74%) and a lower percentage from restorative sleep (AZ: -9.21{+/-}1.27%; J&J&J: -12.6{+/-}1.00%; M1: 0.16{+/-}0.43%; M2: -8.31{+/-}1.05%; P&B1: 1.27{+/-}0.34%; P&B2: -1.36{+/-}0.83%) than the week prior. Across all objective metrics measured, there were general trends that indicated an attenuated response in older populations and a larger response after the second dose for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines (AstraZeneca second dose not analyzed). Importantly, the effects of the vaccines on cardiovascular and sleep measures were transient and returned to baseline by the second night following vaccination (P > 0.05 or absolute Cohens d < 0.25). In summary, these results confirm the previously observed subjective symptomatology trends, and for the first time show that objectively measured cardiovascular and sleep parameters are altered the night after vaccination. Moreover, these results suggest that the response may be different between vaccine manufacturers and may be modified by age and larger after the second dose. This information can be used to inform policy makers and employers considering offering paid time off for vaccination, as well as individuals planning their commitments post-vaccination.","Presby, D.; Capodilupo, E.",2021-04-30,Allergy And Immunology,10.1101/2021.04.29.21256255,1,David Presby,WHOOP Inc,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.29.21256255v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.29.21256255v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
18961,On the anti-correlation between COVID-19 infection rate and natural UV light in the UK,"While it is well established that the rate of COVID-19 infections can be suppressed by social distancing, environmental effects may also affect the infection rate. Here we consider the hypothesis that natural Ultra-Violet (UV) light (UVA and UVB) is reducing COVID-19 infections by enhancing human immunity through vitamin-D and/or by suppressing the virus itself. We focus on the United Kingdom (UK), by examining daily COVID-19 infections (F) and UV Index (UVI) data over the period March to October 2020. We find an intriguing empirical anti-correlation between log10(F) and log10(UVI) with a correlation coefficient of -0.933 over the period from 11 May (when the first UK lockdown ended) to 28 October 2020. The anticorrelation may reflect causation with other factors which are correlated with the UVI. Either way, UVI should be included in modelling the pattern of COVID-19 infections and deaths. We started quantifying such correlations in other countries and regions.","Blum, A.; Nicolaou, C.; Henghes, B.; Lahav, O.",2020-11-30,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.11.28.20240242,1,Ofer Lahav,UCL,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.28.20240242v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.28.20240242v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
12817,Low-Cost Enhancement of Facial Mask Filtration to Prevent Transmission of COVID-19,"The use of face masks is recommended worldwide to reduce the spread of COVID-19. A plethora of facial coverings and respirators, both commercial and homemade, pervade the market, but the true filtration capabilities of many homemade measures against the virus are unclear and continue to be unexplored. In this work, we compare the efficacy of the following masks in keeping out particulate matter below 2.5 microns: N95 respirators, surgical masks, cloth masks, cloth masks with activated carbon air filters, cloth masks with HVAC air filters, lightly starch-enhanced cloth masks, and heavily-starched cloth masks. The experiments utilize an inhalation system and aerosol chamber to simulate a masked individual respiring aerosolized air. COVID-19 disproportionately affects people in low-income communities, who often lack the resources to acquire appropriate personal protective equipment and tend to lack the flexibility to shelter in place due to their public-facing occupations. This work tests low-cost enhancements to homemade masks to assist these communities in making better masks to reduce viral transmission. Experimental results demonstrate that the filtration efficacy of cloth masks with either a light or heavy starch can approach the performance of much costlier masks. This discovery supports the idea of low-cost enhancements to reduce transmission and protect individuals from contracting COVID-19.","Bhimaraju, H.; Nag, N.; Jain, R.",2020-08-04,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.08.01.20166637,1,Nitish Nag,"University of California, Irvine",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.01.20166637v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.01.20166637v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.15406/bbij.2020.09.00316
9031,Comparison of epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Vietnam,"BackgroundThere are limited data on COVID-19 patients in Vietnam. The paper examined and compared epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Vietnam

MethodThe data was obtained using publicly available information from the official website of Vietnam Ministry of Health covering a period of 01/23/2020 to 05/27/2020. T-test, Chi-square test and Fishers Exact test were utilized to compare characteristics of COVID-19 patients between under-treatment and discharge groups and between overseas and non-overseas travel groups.

ResultsVietnam had a total of 327 cases of COVID-19 as of May 27, 2020. The median age of patients was 30 years (ranging from 3 months to 88 years). About 68% of patients (n=223) had acquired the disease from overseas while 32% were infected from local transmission. Among those infected from local transmission, 66% were women. Men were more likely than women to be infected with COVID-19 from overseas (p<0.001). Younger patients were significantly associated with international travel (p=.001). While patients in the South reported highest levels of overseas travel history (77.9%), those (100%) in the Central reported the highest level of being discharged (p<0.001). Women (54.7%) had a higher rate of discharge compared to men (45.3%) [p <0.001]. Nearly 86% have recovered and discharged from hospitals. There has been no reported fatality.

ConclusionsA majority of COVID-19 cases in Vietnam were acquired overseas. A significantly higher number of women than men were infected inside the country calling for further research about gender disparities in the fight against COVID-19 in Vietnam.","Ha, T.

17472,High performances of a novel antigen detection test on nasopharyngeal specimens for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis: a prospective study,"IntroductionThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has become a major public health issue worldwide. Developing and evaluating rapid and easy-to-perform diagnostic tests is an absolute priority. The current study was designed to assess diagnostic performances of an antigen-based rapid detection test (COVID-VIRO(R)) in a real-life setting.

MethodsTwo nasopharyngeal specimens of symptomatic or asymptomatic adult patients hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Department or voluntarily accessing the COVID-19 Screening Department of the Regional Hospital of Orleans, France, were concurrently collected. COVID VIRO(R) diagnostic specificity and sensitivity were assessed in comparison to real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results. A subset of patients underwent an additional oropharyngeal and/or a saliva swab for rapid testing.

Results121 patients already having a confirmed infection and 127 patients having no evidence of recent or ongoing infection were enrolled, for a total of 248 couple of nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Overall COVID-VIRO(R) sensitivity was 96.7% (IC: 93.5%-99.9%). In asymptomatic patients, symptomatic patients having symptoms for more than 4 days and those having a RT-qPCR Cycle threshold value [&ge;]32, sensitivity was of 100%, 95.8% and 91.9% respectively. The concordance between RT-qPCR and COVID VIRO(R) rapid test was 100% for the 127 patients with no SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ConclusionCOVID-VIRO(R) test had 100% specificity and above 95% sensitivity, better than WHO recommendations (specificity [&ge;]97-100%, sensitivity [&ge;]80%).

Many factors have contributed to the spread of COVID-19, and the success of public health interventions depends on the level of community adherence to preventative measures. Public health professionals must also understand regional demographic variation in health disparities and determinants to target interventions more effectively. In this study, a systematic evaluation of three significant interventions employed in the US, and their effectiveness in slowing the early spread of COVID-19 was conducted. Next, community-level compliance with a state-level stay at home orders was assessed to determine COVID-19 spread behavior. Finally, health disparities that may have contributed to the disproportionate acceleration of early COVID-19 spread between certain counties were characterized. The contribution of these factors for the disproportionate spread of the disease was analyzed using both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. Results of this investigation show that delayed implementation of public health interventions, a low level of compliance with the stay at home orders, in conjunction with health disparities, significantly contributed to the early spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jalali, A.

2718,Characterization of anti-viral immunity in recovered individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2,"The WHO has declared SARS-CoV-2 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. However, to date, there was hardly any study in characterizing the immune responses, especially adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we collected blood from COVID-19 patients who have recently become virus-free and therefore were discharged, and analyzed their SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T cell responses. We observed SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity in the patients. Both were detected in newly discharged patients, suggesting both participate in immune-mediated protection to viral infection. However, follow-up patients (2 weeks post discharge) exhibited high titers of IgG antibodies, but with low levels of virus-specific T cells, suggesting that they may enter a quiescent state. Our work has thus provided a basis for further analysis of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19, especially in the severe cases. It has also implications in designing an effective vaccine to protect and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Dong, C.; Ni, L.; Ye, F.; Chen, M.-L.; Feng, Y.; Deng, Y.-Q.; Zhao, H.; Wei, P.; Ge, J.; Li, X.; Sun, L.; Wang, P.; Liang, P.; Guo, H.; Wang, X.; Qin, C.-F.; Chen, F.",2020-03-20,Allergy And Immunology,10.1101/2020.03.17.20036640,1,Chen Dong,"Institute for immunology, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20036640v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20036640v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

ObjectiveTo track down the seroprevalence among a particular group of HCWs working in the anaesthesia department in hospital settings.

Study designTwo rounds of serosurvey were done to track the dynamicity among the 128 and 164 HCWs participants in the first round and second round, respectively. 5 mL of blood was collected and IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibody was tested in Abbott Architect i1000SR.

ResultsThe seroprevalence found in the first and second round was 12.5% and 38.4%, respectively. A significant number (n=61, 77.21%) of seropositivity came from the asymptomatic HCWs group as found in both the survey.

17415,Projected COVID-19 epidemic in the United States in the context of the effectiveness of a potential vaccine and implications for social distancing and face mask use,"BackgroundMultiple candidates of COVID-19 vaccines have entered Phase III clinical trials in the United States (US). There is growing optimism that social distancing restrictions and face mask requirements could be eased with widespread vaccine adoption soon.

MethodsWe developed a dynamic compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission for the four most severely affected states (New York, Texas, Florida, and California). We evaluated the vaccine effectiveness and coverage required to suppress the COVID-19 epidemic in scenarios when social contact was to return to pre-pandemic levels and face mask use was reduced. Daily and cumulative COVID-19 infection and death cases were obtained from the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus resource center and used for model calibration.

ResultsWithout a vaccine, the spread of COVID-19 could be suppressed in these states by maintaining strict social distancing measures and face mask use levels. But relaxing social distancing restrictions to the pre-pandemic level without changing the current face mask use would lead to a new COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in 0.8-4 million infections and 15,000-240,000 deaths across these four states over the next 12 months. In this scenario, introducing a vaccine would partially offset this negative impact even if the vaccine effectiveness and coverage are relatively low. However, if face mask use is reduced by 50%, a vaccine that is only 50% effective (weak vaccine) would require coverage of 55-94% to suppress the epidemic in these states. A vaccine that is 80% effective (moderate vaccine) would only require 32-57% coverage to suppress the epidemic. In contrast, if face mask usage stops completely, a weak vaccine would not suppress the epidemic, and further major outbreaks would occur. A moderate vaccine with coverage of 48-78% or a strong vaccine (100% effective) with coverage of 33-58% would be required to suppress the epidemic. Delaying vaccination rollout for 1-2 months would not substantially alter the epidemic trend if the current interventions are maintained.

ConclusionsThe degree to which the US population can relax social distancing restrictions and face mask use will depend greatly on the effectiveness and coverage of a potential COVID-19 vaccine if future epidemics are to be prevented. Only a highly effective vaccine will enable the US population to return to life as it was before the pandemic.","Shen, M.; Zu, J.; Fairley, C. K.; Pagan, J.

1834,Risk map of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China: proportionate control is needed,"BackgroundChina is running a national level antivirus campaign against the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Strict control measures are being enforced in either the populated areas and remote regions. While the virus is closed to be under control, tremendous economic loss has been caused.

Methods and findingsWe assessed the pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV for all cities/regions in China using the random forest algorithm, taking into account the effect of five factors: the accumulative and increased numbers of confirmed cases, total population, population density, and GDP. We defined four levels of the risk, corresponding to the four response levels to public health emergencies in China. The classification system has good consistency among cities in China, as the error rate of the confusion matrix is 1.58%.

ConclusionsThe pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV is dramatically different among the 442 cities/regions.

OBJECTIVETo develop and validate a predication model, presented as nomogram and scale, to distinguish infectious acute abdomen patients suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

DESIGNDiagnostic model based on retrospective case series.

SETTINGTwo hospitals in Wuhan and Beijing, China.

PTRTICIPANTS584 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 from 2 Jan 2020 to15 Feb 2020 and 238 infectious acute abdomen patients receiving emergency operation from 28 Feb 2019 to 3 Apr 2020.

METHODSLASSO regression and multivariable logistic regression analysis were conducted to develop the prediction model in training cohort. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by calibration curves, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curves in training and validation cohort. A simplified screening scale and managing algorithm was generated according to the nomogram.

RESULTSSix potential COVID-19 prediction variables were selected and the variable abdominal pain was excluded for overmuch weight. The five potential predictors, including fever, chest computed tomography (CT), leukocytes (white blood cells, WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT), were all independent predictors in multivariable logistic regression analysis (p [&le;]0.001) and the nomogram, named COVID-19 Infectious Acute Abdomen Distinguishment (CIAAD) nomogram, was generated. The CIAAD nomogram showed good discrimination and calibration (C-index of 0.981 (95% CI, 0.963 to 0.999) and AUC of 0.970 (95% CI, 0.961 to 0.982)), which was validated in the validation cohort (C-index of 0.966 (95% CI, 0.960 to 0.972) and AUC of 0.966 (95% CI, 0.957 to 0.975)). Decision curve analysis revealed that the CIAAD nomogram was clinically useful. The nomogram was further simplified into the CIAAD scale.

CONCLUSIONSWe established an easy and effective screening model and scale for surgeons in emergency department to distinguish COVID-19 patients from infectious acute abdomen patients. The algorithm based on CIAAD scale will help surgeons manage infectious acute abdomen patients suspected COVID-19 more efficiently.","Zhao, B.; Wei, Y.; Sun, W.; Qin, C.; Zhou, X.; Wang, Z.; Li, T.; Cao, H.; Wang, W.; Wang, Y.",2020-04-23,Surgery,10.1101/2020.04.18.20071019,1,Weibin Wang,"Department of General Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.18.20071019v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.18.20071019v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
24396,Quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant in wastewater by allele-specific RT-qPCR,"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has emerged as a critical public health tool in tracking the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in wastewater has to-date relied on genomic sequencing, which lacks sensitivity necessary to detect low variant abundances in diluted and mixed wastewater samples. Here, we develop and present an open-source method based on allele specific RT-qPCR (AS RT-qPCR) that detects and quantifies the B.1.1.7 variant, targeting spike protein mutations at three independent genomic loci highly predictive of B.1.1.7 (HV69/70del, Y144del, and A570D). Our assays can reliably detect and quantify low levels of B.1.1.7 with low cross-reactivity, and at variant proportions between 0.1% and 1% in a background of mixed SARS-CoV-2. Applying our method to wastewater samples from the United States, we track B.1.1.7 occurrence over time in 19 communities. AS RT-qPCR results align with clinical trends, and summation of B.1.1.7 and wild-type sequences quantified by our assays strongly correlate with SARS-CoV-2 levels indicated by the US CDC N1/N2 assay.

23751,High risk of patient self-inflicted lung injury in COVID-19 with frequently encountered spontaneous breathing patterns: a computational modelling study,"BackgroundThere is ongoing controversy regarding the potential for increased respiratory effort to generate patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) in spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory failure. However, direct clinical evidence linking increased inspiratory effort to lung injury is scarce. We adapted a recently developed computational simulator that replicates distinctive features of COVID-19 pathophysiology to quantify the mechanical forces that could lead to P-SILI at different levels of respiratory effort. In accordance with recent data, the simulator was calibrated to represent a spontaneously breathing COVID-19 patient with severe hypoxaemia (SaO2 80.6%) and relatively well-preserved lung mechanics (lung compliance of 47.5 ml/cmH2O), being treated with supplemental oxygen (FiO2 = 100%).

ResultsSimulations were conducted at tidal volumes (VT) and respiratory rates (RR) of 7 ml/kg and 14 breaths/min (representing normal respiratory effort) and at VT/RR of 15/14, 7/20, 15/20, 10/30, 12/30, 10/35, 12/35, 10/40, 12/40 ml/kg / breaths/min. Lung compliance was unaffected by increased VT but decreased significantly at higher RR. While oxygenation improved, significant increases in multiple indicators of the potential for lung injury were observed at all higher VT/RR combinations tested. Pleural pressure swing increased from 10.1 cmH2O at baseline to 30 cmH2O at VT/RR of 15 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min and to 54.6 cmH2O at 12 ml/kg / 40 breaths/min. Dynamic strain increased from 0.3 to 0.49 at VT/RR of 12 ml/kg / 30 breaths/min, and to 0.6 at 15 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min. Mechanical power increased from 7.83 J/min to 17.7 J/min at VT/RR of 7 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min, and to 240.5 J/min at 12 ml/kg / 40 breaths/min.

ConclusionsOur results suggest that the forces generated during increased inspiratory effort in severe COVID-19 are compatible with the development of P-SILI. If conventional oxygen therapy or non-invasive ventilation is ineffective in reducing respiratory effort, control of driving and transpulmonary pressures with invasive ventilation may reduce the risk of P-SILI and allow time for the resolution of the underlying condition.","Das, A.; Weaver, L.; Saffaran, S.; Yehya, N.; Scott, T.

16036,Vulnerability to rumors during the COVID-19 pandemic:Results of a national survey,"Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, many rumors have emerged. Given prior research linking rumor exposure to mental well-being, we conducted a nation-wide survey to document the base rate of rumor exposure and factors associated with rumor vulnerability. Between March to July 2020, 1237 participants were surveyed on 5 widely-disseminated COVID-19 rumors (that drinking water frequently could be preventive, that eating garlic could be preventive, that the outbreak arose because of bat soup consumption, that the virus was created in an American lab, and that the virus was created in a Chinese lab). For each rumor, participants reported whether they had heard, shared or believed each rumor. Although most participants had been exposed to COVID-19 rumors, few shared or believed these. Sharing behaviors sometimes occurred in the absence of belief; however, education emerged as a protective factor for both sharing and belief. Together, our results suggest that campaigns targeting skills associated with higher education (e.g. epistemology) may prove more effective than counter-rumor messages.

21694,Diagnostic accuracy of PanbioTM rapid antigen tests on oropharyngeal swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundAntigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 offer new opportunities for testing in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) are the reference sample type, but oropharyngeal swabs (OPS) may be a more acceptable sample type in some patients.

MethodsWe conducted a prospective study in a single screening center to assess the diagnostic performance of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott) on OPS compared with reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) using NPS.

Results402 outpatients were enrolled in a COVID-19 screening center, of whom 168 (41.8%) had a positive RT-qPCR test. The oropharyngeal Ag-RDT sensitivity compared to nasopharyngeal RT-qPCR was 81% (95%CI: 74.2-86.6). Two false positives were noted out of the 234 RT-qPCR negative individuals, which resulted in a specificity of 99.1% (95%CI: 96.9-99.9) for the Ag-RDT.

5165,Current Understanding of COVID-19 Clinical Course and Investigational Treatments,"ImportanceCurrently, there is no unified framework linking disease progression to established viral levels, clinical tests, inflammatory markers, and investigational treatment options.

ObjectiveIt may take many weeks or months to establish a standard treatment approach. Given the growing morbidity and mortality with respect to COVID-19, we present a treatment approach based on a thorough review of scholarly articles and clinical reports. Our focus is on staged progression, clinical algorithms, and individualized treatment.

Evidence ReviewWe followed the protocol for a quality review article proposed by Heyn et. al.1 A literature search was conducted to find all relevant studies related to COVID-19. The search was conducted between April 1, 2020 and April 13, 2020 using the following electronic databases: PubMed (1809 to present), Google Scholar (1900 to present), MEDLINE (1946 to present), CINAHL (1937 to present), and Embase (1980 to present). Keywords used included COVID-19, 2019-nCov, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, with terms such as efficacy, seroconversion, microbiology, pathophysiology, viral levels, inflammation, survivability, and treatment and pharmacology. No language restriction was placed on the search. Reference lists were manually scanned for additional studies.

FindingsOf the articles found in the literature search, 70 were selected for inclusion in this study (67 cited in the body of the manuscript and 3 additional unique references in the Figures).

The articles represent work from China, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Rwanda, Israel, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada, and the United States. Most of the articles were cohort or case studies, but we also drew upon information found in guidelines from hospitals and clinics instructing their staff on procedures to follow. In addition, we based some decisions on data collected by agencies such as the CDC, FDA, IHME, ISDA, and Worldometer. None of the case studies or cohort studies used a large number of participants. The largest group of participants numbered less than 500 and some case studies had fewer than 30 patients. However, the review of the literature revealed the need for individualized treatment protocols due to the variability of patient clinical presentation and survivability. A number of factors appear to influence mortality: the stage at which the patient first presented for care, pre-existing health conditions, age, and the viral load the patient carried.

Conclusion and RelevanceCOVID-19 can be divided into three distinct Stages, beginning at the time of infection (Stage I), sometimes progressing to pulmonary involvement (Stage II, with or without hypoxemia) and less frequently to systemic inflammation (Stage III). In addition to modeling the stages of disease progression, we have also created a treatment algorithm which considers age, comorbidities, clinical presentation, and disease progression to suggest drug classes or treatment modalities. This paper presents the first evidence-based recommendations for individualized treatment for COVID-19.

14678,COVID-19 superspreading in cities versus the countryside,"So far, the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterised by an initial rapid rise in new cases followed by a peak and a more erratic behaviour that varies between regions. This is not easy to reproduce with traditional SIR models, which predict a more symmetric epidemic. Here, we argue that superspreaders and population heterogeneity are the core factors explaining this discrepancy. We do so through an agent-based lattice model of a disease spreading in a heterogeneous population. We predict that an epidemic driven by superspreaders will spread rapidly in cities, but not in the countryside where the sparse population limits the maximal number of secondary infections. This suggests that mitigation strategies should include restrictions on venues where people meet a large number of strangers. Furthermore, mitigating the epidemic in cities and in the countryside may require different levels of restrictions.","Eilersen, A.; Sneppen, K.",2020-10-14,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.04.20188359,2,Kim Sneppen,University of Copenhagen,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188359v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188359v2.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1111/apm.13120
6779,Predicting the Growth and Trend of COVID-19 Pandemic using Machine Learning and Cloud Computing,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe outbreak of COVID-19 Coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV-2, has created a calamitous situation throughout the world. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing day by day. Machine Learning (ML) and Cloud Computing can be deployed very effectively to track the disease, predict growth of the epidemic and design strategies and policy to manage its spread. This study applies an improved mathematical model to analyse and predict the growth of the epidemic. An ML-based improved model has been applied to predict the potential threat of COVID-19 in countries worldwide. We show that using iterative weighting for fitting Generalized Inverse Weibull distribution, a better fit can be obtained to develop a prediction framework. This can be deployed on a cloud computing platform for more accurate and real-time prediction of the growth behavior of the epidemic. A data driven approach with higher accuracy as here can be very useful for a proactive response from the government and citizens. Finally, we propose a set of research opportunities and setup grounds for further practical applications.

8792,SIR-PID: A Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller for COVID-19 Outbreak Containment,"Ongoing social restrictions, as distancing and lockdown, adopted by many countries for contrasting the COVID-19 epidemic spread, try to find a trade-off between induced economic crisis, healthcare system collapse and costs in terms of human lives. Applying and removing restrictions on a system with uncontrollable inertia, as represented by an epidemic outbreak, may create critical instabilities, overshoots and strong oscillations of infected people around the desirable set-point, defined as the maximum number of hospitalizations acceptable by a given healthcare system. A good understanding of the system reaction to a change of the input control variable can be reasonably achieved using a proportional-integral-derivative controller, widely used in technological applications. In this paper we make use of this basic control theory for understanding the reaction of COVID-19 propagation to social restrictions and for exploiting a very known technology to reduce the epidemic damages through the correct tuning of the containment policy.","Rossi, N.; Ianni, A.",2020-06-03,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.30.20117556,1,Nicola Rossi,Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.30.20117556v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.30.20117556v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
8887,A prediction model based on machine learning for diagnosing the early COVID-19 patients,"With the dramatically fast spread of COVID-9, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test has become the gold standard method for confirmation of COVID-19 infection. However, RT-PCR tests are complicated in operation andIt usually takes 5-6 hours or even longer to get the result. Additionally, due to the low virus loads in early COVID-19 patients, RT-PCR tests display false negative results in a number of cases. Analyzing complex medical datasets based on machine learning provides health care workers excellent opportunities for developing a simple and efficient COVID-19 diagnostic system. This paper aims at extracting risk factors from clinical data of early COVID-19 infected patients and utilizing four types of traditional machine learning approaches including logistic regression(LR), support vector machine(SVM), decision tree(DT), random forest(RF) and a deep learning-based method for diagnosis of early COVID-19. The results show that the LR predictive model presents a higher specificity rate of 0.95, an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.971 and an improved sensitivity rate of 0.82, which makes it optimal for the screening of early COVID-19 infection. We also perform the verification for generality of the best model (LR predictive model) among Zhejiang population, and analyze the contribution of the factors to the predictive models. Our manuscript describes and highlights the ability of machine learning methods for improving the accuracy and timeliness of early COVID-19 infection diagnosis. The higher AUC of our LR-base predictive model makes it a more conducive method for assisting COVID-19 diagnosis. The optimal model has been encapsulated as a mobile application (APP) and implemented in some hospitals in Zhejiang Province.","Nan, S. N.; Ya, Y.; Ling, T. L.; Ning, D. Y.; Nv, G. H.; Ying, P.

14860,Model-informed COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies by age and serostatus,"When a vaccine for COVID-19 becomes available, limited initial supply will raise the question of how to prioritize the available doses and thus underscores the need for transparent, evidence-based strategies that relate knowledge of, and uncertainty in, disease transmission, risk, vaccine efficacy, and existing population immunity. Here, we employ a model-informed approach to vaccine prioritization that evaluates the impact of prioritization strategies on cumulative incidence and mortality and accounts for population factors such as age, contact structure, and seroprevalence, and vaccine factors including imperfect and age-varying efficacy. This framework can be used to evaluate and compare existing strategies, and it can also be used to derive an optimal prioritization strategy to minimize mortality or incidence. We find that a transmission-blocking vaccine should be prioritized to adults ages 20-49y to minimize cumulative incidence and to adults over 60y to minimize mortality. Direct vaccination of adults over 60y minimizes mortality for vaccines that do not block transmission. We also estimate the potential benefit of using individual-level serological tests to redirect doses to only seronegative individuals, improving the marginal impact of each dose. We argue that this serology-informed vaccination approach may improve the efficiency of vaccination efforts while partially addressing existing inequities in COVID-19 burden and impact.","Bubar, K.

3499,"Clinical features, Diagnosis, and Treatment of COVID-19: A systematic review of case reports and case series","ObjectivesThe 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been declared a public health emergency worldwide. The objective of this systematic review was to characterize the clinical, diagnostic, and treatment characteristics of patients presenting with COVID-19.

MethodsWe conducted a structured search using PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library to collect both case reports and case series on COVID-19 published up to February 30, 2020.

ResultsThirty-four articles were included analyzing a total of 99 patients with a mean age of 46.2 years. The most common presenting symptom in patients who tested positive for COVID-19 was fever, reported in up to 83% of patients from 76.4% of the analyzed studies. Other symptoms including rhinorrhea, dizziness, and chills were less frequently reported. Additionally, in studies which reported C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements (44%), a large majority of patients displayed an elevated CRP (73%). Progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was the most common complication of patients testing positive for COVID-19 (33%). CT images displayed ground-glass opacification (GGO) patterns (80%) as well as bilateral lung involvement (71.0%). The most commonly used antiviral treatment modalities included, lopinavir (HIV protease inhibitor), arbidiol hydrochloride (influenza fusion inhibitor), and oseltamivir (neuraminidase inhibitor).

ConclusionsDevelopment of ARDS may play a role in estimating disease progression and mortality risk. Early detection of elevations in serum CRP, combined with a clinical COVID-19 symptom presentation may be used as a surrogate marker for presence and severity of disease. There is a paucity of data surrounding the efficacy of treatments. There is currently not a well-established gold standard therapy for the treatment of diagnosed COVID-19. Further prospective investigations are necessary.","Tahvildari, A.; Arbabi, M.; Farsi, Y.; Jamshidi, P.; Hasanzadeh, S.; Calcagno, T. M.; Nasiri, M.

5032,Application of a Semi-empirical Dynamic Model to Forecast the Propagation of the COVID-19 Epidemics in Spain.,"A semi-empirical model, based on the logistic map approach, was developed and applied to forecast the different phases of the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic. This model can be used to make predictions of the propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in different spatial scales: from a world scale to a country or even a smaller scale. Predictions on persons hospitalized, number of ventilators needed at ICUs and potential numbers of deaths were successfully carried out in different countries using this approach. This paper shows the mathematical basis for the model together with a proposal for its calibration on the different phases of the epidemic.

Specific results are shown for the COVID-19 epidemic in Spain. For predicting the evolution of the epidemic four phases were considered: non-controlled evolution since the 20th of February; total lock-down from the 15th of March; partial easing of the lock-down from the 13th of April; and a phased lock-down easing from the 1st of May.

In a first phase, if no control is established, the model predicted in Spain 12 millions of infected people of a total of 46.6 millions inhabitants. From those infected nearly 1 million people would need intensive care and around 700,000 deaths would be directly produced by the disease. However, as these numbers would occur in a brief period (few months), the number of deaths would have been higher due to the saturation of the health system.

For a second phase, considering a total lock-down of the whole country from the 15th of March, the model predicted for the 17th of April 194,000 symptomatic infected cases, 85,700 hospitalized, nearly 8,600 patients with needs of an ICU and 19,500 deaths. The model also predicted the peak to be produced between the 29th of March and the 3rd of April. Although the data are still under revision, the accuracy in all the predictions was very good, as the reported values by that day were 197,142 infected, 7,548 inpatients needing an ICU and 20,043 deaths. The peak was produced between the 31st of May and the 2nd of April.

For the third phase, the ease of the lock-down which began the 13th of April, early predictions were made by the beginning of April [Mora et al., 2020]. Assuming conservatively an infection daily rate of a 3% (r = 1.03) the model predicted 400,000 infections and 46, 000 {+/-} 15,000 deaths by the end of May. The predictions overestimated the real values, due to a stricter reduction of the infection daily rate which lead to values of r < 1% and a revision of the whole series of data by the health authorities carried out along the month of May. A new prediction performed with updated parameters at the beginning of May provided a prediction of 250,000 infected and 29,000 {+/-} 15,000 deaths. The reported values by the end of May were 282,870 infected and 28,552 deaths.

After the total easing of the lock-down many uncertainties appear, but the model predicts that the health system would not saturate if the daily rate of infections r is kept below 1.02 (2% of daily increase in the number of symptomatic infected).

This simple model provides a system to predict the evolution of epidemics with a good accuracy, even during epidemics development, where other systems have difficulties in their calibration. As the parameters involved in the model are based in empirical values of the different quantities (e.g. number of inpatients or deaths, related with the number of infected persons) it can be dynamically adjusted and adapted to sudden changes in the statistics.

As other models, the results provided by this model can be used by the authorities to support decision making in order to optimize resources and to minimize the consequences of epidemics, including the future outbreaks of the COVID-19 which will occur.","Mora, J.

16376,Clinical characteristics and outcomes of adult patients admitted with COVID-19 in East London: a retrospective cohort analysis,"BackgroundDescriptions of clinical characteristics of patients hospitalised with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), their clinical course and short-term in- and outpatient outcomes in deprived urban populations in the United Kingdom are still relatively sparse. We describe the epidemiology, clinical course, experience of non-invasive ventilation and intensive care, mortality and short-term sequalae of patients admitted to two large District General Hospitals across a large East London NHS Trust during the first wave of the pandemic.

MethodsA retrospective analysis was carried out on a cohort of 1,946 patients with a clinical or laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, including descriptive statistics and survival analysis. A more detailed analysis was undertaken of a subset of patients admitted across three Respiratory Units in the trust.

ResultsIncreasing age, male sex and Asian ethnicity were associated with worse outcomes. Increasing severity of chest X-ray abnormalities trended with mortality. Radiological changes persisted in over 50% of cases at early follow up (6 weeks). Ongoing symptoms including hair loss, memory impairment, breathlessness, cough and fatigue were reported in 67% of survivors, with 42% of patients unable to return to work due to ongoing symptoms.

ConclusionsUnderstanding the acute clinical features, course of illness and outcomes of COVID-19 will be vital in preparing for further peaks of the pandemic. Our initial follow up data suggest there are ongoing sequalae of COVID-19 including persistent symptoms and radiological abnormalities. Further data, including longer term follow up data, are necessary to improve our understanding of this novel pathogen and associated disease.

Section 1: What is already known on this topicPrevious studies have reported that increasing age, male sex, Black and Asian ethnicity increased risk of death for patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is little published literature regarding the follow up of patients with COVID-19.

Section 2: What this study addsOur study is one of the first with follow up data for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. We show that radiological abnormality persisted at 6 weeks in over 50% of patients, as well as significantly increased breathlessness in patients without baseline dyspnoea. Our study confirms that increasing age, male sex and Asian ethnicity increased risk of death for patients, but also in an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population in East London.","Cheng, D.; Calderwood, C.; Skyllberg, E.; Ainley, A.",2020-10-11,Respiratory Medicine,10.1101/2020.10.08.20193623,1,Adam Ainley,"Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.08.20193623v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.08.20193623v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1136/bmjresp-2020-000813
20017,"Healthcare worker intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and reasons for hesitancy: A survey of 16,158 health system employees on the eve of vaccine distribution","Healthcare workers (HCWs) have been recommended to receive first priority for limited COVID-19 vaccines. They have also been identified as potential ambassadors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, helping to ensure that sufficient members of a hesitant public accept COVID-19 vaccines to achieve population immunity. Yet HCWs themselves have shown vaccine hesitancy in other contexts and the few prior surveys of U.S. HCW intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine report acceptance rates of only 28% to 34%. However, it is unknown whether HCW acceptance remains low following mid-November announcements of the efficacy of the first COVID-19 vaccines and the issuance of two emergency use authorizations (EUA) in December. We report the results of a December 2020 survey (N = 16,158; response rate 61%) administered by a large Pennsylvania health system to determine the intentions of its employees to receive a vaccine when it is offered to them. In a mixed sample of individuals serving in patient-facing and other roles, 55% would decide to receive a COVID-19 vaccine when offered, 16.4% would not, and 28.5% reported being undecided. The distribution of responses varied little across hospital campuses, between those in patient-facing roles and other HCWs, or by area or department of work. The higher rate of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance we observe may reflect the framing and timing of our survey. Among hesitant respondents, an overwhelming majority (90.3%) reported concerns about unknown risks and insufficient data. Other commonly reported concerns included known side effects (57.4%) and wanting to wait until they see how it goes with others (44.4%). We observed a substantial increase in self-reported intent to receive a COVID-19 vaccine after an FDA advisory committee voted to recommend an EUA. Among respondents who completed the survey after that point in time, 79% intend to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (n = 1155). Although only suggestive, this trend offers hope that rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance may be higher among HCWs and, perhaps, the general public than more hypothetical survey results have indicated.","Meyer, M.

As further investigation, virus sequence alignment with primers oligonucleotide was analyzed.

Design or methods11,652 samples from Japanese population were tested for SARS-CoV-2 positive using recommended RT-PCR primer-probe sets from Japan National Institute of Infectious Disease (NIID) and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

ResultsOf the 102 positive samples, 17 samples (16.7% of total positives) showed inconsistent results when tested simultaneously for the following primers: JPN-N2, JPN-N1, CDC-N1, and CDC-N2. As a result, CDC recommended primer-probe sets showed relatively higher sensitivity and accuracy. Further virus sequence alignment analysis showed evidences for virus mutation happening at primers binding sites.

ConclusionsThe inconsistency in the RT-PCR results for JPN-N1, JPN-N2, CDC-N1, and CDC-N2 primer-probe sets could be attributed to differences in virus mutation at primers binding site as observed in sequence analysis. The use of JPN-N2 combined with CDC-N2 primer produces the most effective result to reduce false negatives in Japan region. In addition, adding CDC-N1 will also help to detect false negatives.","Tsutae, W.; Chaochaisit, W.; Aoshima, H.; Ida, C.; Miyakawa, S.; Sekine, H.; Sheikh, A.; Baran, I.

Here, in this manuscript, we developed a set of SARS-CoV-2 enrichment probes to increase the sensitivity of sequence-based virus detection and characterization via obtaining the comprehensive genome sequence. Following the CDC health and safety guidelines, we test the concept using the culturing supernatant contain SARS-CoV-2 particles, and its full-length sequence was used for further analysis. The fraction of SARS-CoV-2 endogenous DNA was 93.47% with Cluster Factor about 1.1, which demonstrate that the numbers of mapped reads to SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence significantly increased, compared to metagenomic sequencing technology, following SARS-CoV-2 probe enrichment. Moreover, based on the high-quality sequence, we discussed the heterozygosity and viral expression during replication of coronavirus, and its phylogenetic relationship with other selected high-quality samples from The Genome Variation Map (GVM) (on 2020/03/22). We believe this manuscript is valuable for all the researchers who are interested in using clinical warp samples to obtain the high coverage of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence with a relatively low concentration of viral particles.

22783,Control of COVID-19 transmission on an urban university campus during a second wave of the pandemic,"ImportanceThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has severely disrupted United States educational institutions. Given potential adverse financial psychosocial effects of campus closures, many institutions developed strategies to reopen campuses in the fall despite the ongoing threat of COVID-19. Many however opted to have limited campus re-opening in order to minimize potential risk of spread of SARS-CoV-2.

ObjectiveTo analyze how Boston University (BU) fully reopened its campus in the fall of 2020 and controlled COVID-19 transmission despite worsening transmission in the city of Boston.

DesignMulti-faceted intervention case study.

SettingLarge urban university campus.

InterventionsThe BU response included a high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing facility with capacity to delivery results in less than 24 hours; routine asymptomatic screening for COVID-19; daily health attestations; compliance monitoring and feedback; robust contact tracing, quarantine and isolation in on campus facilities; face mask use; enhanced hand hygiene; social distancing recommendations; de-densification of classrooms and public places; and enhancement of all building air systems.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresBetween August and December 2020, BU conducted >500,000 COVID-19 tests and identified 719 individuals with COVID-19: 496 (69.0%) students, 11 (1.5%) faculty, and 212 (29.5%) staff. Overall, about 1.8% of the BU community tested positive. Of 837 close contacts traced, 86 (10.3%) tested positive for COVID-19. BU contact tracers identified a source of transmission for 51.5% of cases with 55.7% identifying a source outside of BU. Among infected faculty and staff with a known source of infection, the majority reported a transmission source outside of BU (100% for faculty and 79.8% for staff). A BU source was identified by 59.2% of undergraduate students and 39.8% of graduate students; notably no transmission was traced to a classroom setting.

Conclusions and RelevanceBU was successful in containing COVID-19 transmission on campus while minimizing off campus acquisition of COVID-19 from the greater Boston area. A coordinated strategy of testing, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine, with robust management and oversight, can control COVID-19 transmission, even in an urban university setting.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan a multi-faceted approach lead to control of COVID-19 transmission and spread on an urban campus?

FindingsDespite a second wave of SARS-CoV-2 in the greater Boston area, Boston University was able to minimize outbreaks by means of active surveillance of campus populations, isolation of infected individuals, early, effective contact tracing and quarantine, regular communication, excellent data systems, and strong leadership. Most transmission appeared to occur off campus and there was no evidence of classroom transmission.

MeaningUsing the main axioms of infection control including frequent testing, vigorous contact tracing, and rapid isolation and quarantine, and a strong leadership structure to ensure nimble decision-making and rapid adaption to emerging data, controlling the transmission and spread of SARS-CoV-2 on an urban campus was feasible despite worsening local transmission during the course of the semester.","Hamer, D.

4284,Application of COVID-19 pneumonia diffusion data to predict epidemic situation,"ObjectiveTo evaluate novel coronavirus pneumonia cases by establishing the mathematical model of the number of confirmed cases daily, and to assess the current situation and development of the epidemic situation, so as to provide a digital basis for decision-making.

MethodsThe number of newly confirmed covid-19 cases per day was taken as the research object, and the seven-day average value (M) and the sequential value (R) of M were calculated to study the occurrence and development of covid-19 epidemic through the analysis of charts and data.

ResultsM reflected the current situation of epidemic development; R reflected the current level of infection and the trend of epidemic development.

ConclusionThe current data can be used to evaluate the number of people who have been infected, and when R < 1, the peak of epidemic can be predicted.

PrefaceIn December 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia with unknown causes were found in some hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. On 11 March 2020, the director-general of the world health organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced that based on the assessment, WHO believes that the current outbreak of COVID-19 can be called a global pandemic. By early April 2020, there were more than one million confirmed cases worldwide.

COVID-19 has developed from sporadic cases to pandemic in a short period of 3 months. The analysis and research of its infectious data will help to prevent and control the next stage of epidemic prevention and other infectious diseases in the future.

In this paper, COVID-19 rounded average of seven days (M), and Ms ring ratio (R) are used to predict the current potential patients data, and the relative state of epidemic prevention and control is judged through the graphic features and characteristic data, so as to provide evidence for the prevention and control decisions.","Wu, Z.",2020-04-14,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.11.20061432,1,Zhenguo Wu,Xi\'an Jioatong University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20061432v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20061432v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
22098,"The effect of respiratory activity, ventilatory therapy and facemasks on total aerosol emissions","Background Exhaled respirable aerosols (<5 m diameter) present a high risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. Many guidelines recommend using aerosol precautions during """"aerosol generating procedures"""" (AGPs) and droplet (>5 m) precautions at other times. However, there is emerging evidence that respiratory activities such as cough and not AGPs are the important source of aerosols. Methods We used a novel chamber with an optical particle counter sampling at 100 L/min to count and size-fractionate all exhaled particles (0.5-25 m). We compared emissions from ten healthy subjects during respiratory """"activities"""" (quiet breathing, talking, shouting, forced expiratory maneuvers, exercise and coughing) with respiratory """"therapies"""" designated as AGPs: high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) and single or dual circuit non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, NIPPV-S and NIPPV-D, respectively. Activities were repeated wearing facemasks. Results Compared to quiet breathing, respiratory activities increased particle counts between 34.6-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.2 to 79.1) during talking, to 370.8-fold (95% CI, 162.3 to 847.1) during coughing (p<0.001). During quiet breathing, HFNO at 60 L/min increased counts 2.3-fold (95% CI, 1.2 to 4.4) (p=0.03) and NIPPV-S and NIPPV-D at 25/10 cm H2O increased counts by 2.6-fold (95% CI, 1.7 to 4.1) and 7.8-fold (95% CI, 4.4 to 13.6) respectively (p<0.001). During activities, respiratory therapies and facemasks reduced emissions compared to activities alone. Conclusion Talking, exertional breathing and coughing generate substantially more aerosols than the respiratory therapies HFNO and NIPPV which can reduce total emissions. The risk of aerosol exposure is underappreciated and warrants widespread targeted interventions.","Wilson, N.; Marks, G.; Eckhardt, A.; Clarke, A.; Young, F.; Garden, F.; Stewart, W.; Cook, T.; Tovey, E.",2021-02-10,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.02.07.21251309,2,Nicholas Wilson,Prince of Wales Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.07.21251309v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.07.21251309v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1111/anae.15475
12787,Land Use Change and Coronavirus Emergence Risk,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) causing coronaviruses are mostly discovered in Asian horseshoe bats. It is still unclear how ongoing land use changes may facilitate SARS-related coronavirus transmission to humans. Here we use a multivariate hotspot analysis of high-resolution land-use data to show that regions of China populated by horseshoe bats are hotspots of forest fragmentation, livestock and human density. We also identify areas susceptible to new hotspot emergence in response to moderate expansion of urbanization, livestock production, or forest disturbance, thereby highlighting regions vulnerable to SARS-CoV spillover under future land-use change. In China population growth and increasing meat consumption associated with urbanization and economic development have expanded the footprint of agriculture, leading to human encroachment in wildlife habitat and increased livestock density in areas adjacent to fragmented forests. The reduced distance between horseshoe-bats and humans elevates the risk for SARS-related coronavirus transmission to humans.

21426,A cross-sectional survey of the workplace factors contributing to symptoms of anxiety and depression among nurses and physicians during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in two US healthcare systems,"BackgroundAnxiety and depression among physicians and nurses during COVID-19 pandemic in the USA is not well described and its modifiable causes poorly understood.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional survey of symptoms of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) among physicians and nurses in two US healthcare systems June-Sept 2020. We ascertained features of work as well as its perceptions and associated concerns in relation to risk of anxiety and depression, while controlling for health history via regression and path analyses.

ResultsAbout a third of 684 nurses and 185 physicians surveyed showed symptoms of anxiety or depression, the excess was particularly prominent in nurses. Belief in having been infected was a dominant cause of anxiety and depression, more related to history of symptoms of pneumonia, then the contact with infected patients. Having confidence in competent use and access to personal protective equipment, maintaining usual working hours and being surrounded by colleagues who were both sufficient in numbers and not stressed, was protective. Having support of immediate family and religious communities lessened anxiety and depression after accounting for other factors. Involvement in aerosol-generating procedures with infected patients was linked with lower depression in nurses but higher among physicians. Likewise, the setting of recent patient encounters affected risk differently for physicians and nurses.

ConclusionsOur findings may help develop mitigation measures and underscore the need to help nurses and physicians bear the psychological burden of COVID-19 pandemic and similar events in the future.","Burstyn, I.; Holt, K.",2021-01-26,Occupational And Environmental Health,10.1101/2021.01.25.21250315,1,Igor Burstyn,Drexel University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.25.21250315v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.25.21250315v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
12051,In-silico modeling of COVID-19 ARDS: pathophysiological insights and potential management implications,"ObjectivesPatients with COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (CARDS) appear to present with at least two distinct phenotypes: severe hypoxemia with relatively well-preserved lung compliance and lung gas volumes (Type 1) and a more conventional ARDS phenotype displaying the typical characteristics of the  baby lung (Type 2). We aimed to test plausible hypotheses regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying CARDS, and to evaluate the resulting implications for ventilatory management.

DesignWe adapted a high-fidelity computational simulator, previously validated in several studies of ARDS, to (a) develop quantitative insights into the key pathophysiologic differences between CARDS and conventional ARDS, and (b) assess the impact of different PEEP, FiO2 and tidal volume settings.

SettingInterdisciplinary Collaboration in Systems Medicine Research Network.

SubjectsThe simulator was calibrated to represent CARDS patients with both normal and elevated body mass indices undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation.

Measurements and Main ResultsAn ARDS model implementing disruption of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and vasodilation leading to hyperperfusion of collapsed lung regions failed to replicate clinical data on Type 1 CARDS patients. Adding mechanisms to reflect disruption of alveolar gas-exchange due to the effects of pneumonitis, and heightened vascular resistance due to the emergence of microthrombi, produced levels of V/Q mismatch and hypoxemia consistent with data from Type 1 CARDS patients, while preserving close to normal lung compliance and gas volumes. Atypical responses to PEEP increments between 5 and 15 cmH2O were observed for this Type 1 CARDS model across a range of measures: increasing PEEP resulted in reduced lung compliance and no improvement in oxygenation, while Mechanical Power, Driving Pressure and Plateau Pressure all increased. FiO2 settings based on ARDSnet protocols at different PEEP levels were insufficient to achieve adequate oxygenation. Incrementing tidal volumes from 5 to 10 ml/kg produced similar increases in multiple indicators of ventilator induced lung injury in the Type 1 CARDS model to those seen in a conventional ARDS model.

ConclusionsOur model suggests that use of standard PEEP/ FiO2 tables, higher PEEP strategies, and higher tidal volumes, may all be potentially deleterious in Type 1 CARDS patients, and that a highly personalized approach to treatment is advisable.","Das, A.; Saffaran, S.; Chikhani, M.; Scott, T.; Laviola, M.; Yehya, N.; Laffey, J.; Hardman, J.

Therefore, the combination of an optimal assay kit is necessary.

MethodsWe compared the ability to screen SARS-CoV-2 among three primer-probe sets in two different master mixes, Invitrogen SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR and LightCycler Multiplex RNA Virus Master.

ResultsThe assay with TIB-Molbiol, IDT, and Phu Sa sets for LightCycler Multiplex RNA Virus Master or Invitrogen SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR showed positive results from a single reaction of triplicate in the three days of 4.8 copies per reaction. R-squared and amplification efficiency were 0.97 and ranged from 107 to 108%, respectively.

ConclusionsOur findings indicated that TIB-Molbiol, IDT, and Phu Sa primer-probe sets could be beneficial for the laboratory screening of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR assay of E gene.

13028,"Epidemiology of Reopening in the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States, Europe and Asia","Since the discovery of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19 has become a global healthcare and economic crisis. The United States (US) and Europe exhibited wide impacts from the virus with more than six million cases by the time of our analysis. To inhibit spread, stay-at-home orders and other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were instituted. Beginning late April 2020, some US states, European, and Asian countries lifted restrictions and started the reopening phases. In this study, the changes of confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and deaths were analyzed after reopening for 11 countries and 40 US states using an interrupted time series analysis. Additionally, the distribution of these categories was further analyzed by age due to the known increased risk in elderly patients. Reopening had varied effects on COVID-19 cases depending on the region. Recent increases in cases did not fully translate into increased deaths. Eight countries had increased cases after reopening while only two countries showed the same trend in deaths. In the US, 30 states had observed increases in cases while only seven observed increased deaths. In addition, we found that states with later reopening dates were more likely to have significant decreases in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Furthermore, age distributions through time were analyzed in relation to COVID-19 in the US. Younger age groups typically had an increased share of cases after reopening.","Zhang, W.; Oltean, A.; Nichols, S.; Odeh, F.; Zhong, F.",2020-08-06,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.05.20168757,1,Fei Zhong,"MilliporeSigma, St. Louis, Missouri, a business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168757v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168757v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
19631,Association of Mortality and Aspirin Prescription for COVID-19 Patients at the Veterans Health Administration,"There is growing evidence that thrombotic and inflammatory pathways contribute to the severity of COVID-19. Common medications such as aspirin, that mitigate these pathways, may decrease COVID-19 mortality. This assessment was designed to quantify the correlation between aspirin and mortality for COVID-19 positive patients in our care. Data from the Veterans Health Administration national electronic health record database was utilized for the evaluation. Veterans from across the country with a first positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction lab result were included in the evaluation which comprised 28,350 patients from March 2, 2020 to September 13, 2020 for the 14-day mortality cohort and 26,346 patients from March 2, 2020 to August 28, 2020 for the 30-day mortality cohort. Patients were matched via propensity scores and the odds of mortality were then compared. Among COVID-19 positive Veterans, preexisting aspirin prescription was associated with a statistically and clinically significant decrease in overall mortality at 14-days (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.32-0.46) and at 30-days (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.33-0.45), cutting the odds of mortality by more than half. Findings demonstrated that pre-diagnosis aspirin prescription was strongly associated with decreased mortality rates for Veterans diagnosed with COVID-19.

8254,Excess mortality in England and Wales during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic,"BackgroundDeaths during the COVID-19 pandemic result directly from infection and exacerbation of other diseases and indirectly from deferment of care for other conditions, and are socially and geographically patterned. We quantified excess mortality in regions of England and Wales during the pandemic, for all causes and for non-COVID-19 associated deaths.

MethodsWeekly mortality data for 1 Jan 2010 to 1 May 2020 for England and Wales were obtained from the Office of National Statistics. Mean-dispersion negative binomial regressions were used to model death counts based on pre-pandemic trends and exponentiated linear predictions were subtracted from: i) all-cause deaths; and ii) all-cause deaths minus COVID-19 related deaths for the pandemic period (07-13 March to 25 April to 8 May).

FindingsBetween 7 March and 8 May 2020, there were 47,243 (95%CI: 46,671 to 47,815) excess deaths in England and Wales, of which 9,948 (95%CI: 9,376 to 10,520) were not associated with COVID-19. Overall excess mortality rates varied from 49 per 100,000 (95%CI: 49 to 50) in the South West to 102 per 100,000 (95%CI: 102 to 103) in London. Non-COVID-19 associated excess mortality rates ranged from -1 per 100,000 (95%CI: -1 to 0) in Wales (i.e. mortality rates were no higher than expected) to 26 per 100,000 (95%CI: 25 to 26) in the West Midlands.

InterpretationThe COVID-19 pandemic has had markedly different impacts on the regions of England and Wales, both for deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 infection and for deaths resulting from the national public health response.

Since the outbreak of severe acute and Middle East respiratory syndromes coronavirus was not reported to cause human infections. Now, it become an epidemic proportion with growing number of cases and deaths.

MethodsA scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework. In this scoping review, 50 records published before 28 March, 2020 were included and discussed to better understand the current epidemiology, pathogenesis, immunological response, diagnosis, evasion mechanisms and suggested strategies to boost immune system, challenges, treatment, and future preventions of the virus. PubMed, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, Global Health and google scholars were searched comprehensively for articles, preprints, grey literatures, reports, websites, conference proceedings and expert information. Studies conducted in human and published in English language were included in the analysis. All the findings and statements of the review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in citations.

ResultsWe identified 360 records, of which 50 studies met the inclusion criteria. We synthesized the data from the included records and dig out the deep insights of them and pooled into this review. The burden of the outbreak is worsening due to overcrowding, presence of asymptomatic carriers, scarcity of test kits, the immune escaping ability of the virus and lack of awareness.

Conclusions and recommendationsDue to the fast-spreading nature of COVID-19 the prevention and control strategies become challenging. It is imposing social, psychological, and socio-economic impacts. We recommended that following social distancing, isolation suspects, using personal protective equipment, health education and introducing hand-washing practices, avoiding contact with animals, vaccine development and treatment for controlling and prevention.","Berhe, B.; Legese, H.; Degefa, H.; Adhanom, G.; Gebrewahd, A.; Mardu, F.; Tesfay, K.; Welay, M.; Negash, H.",2020-04-06,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.04.02.20051052,1,Hadush Negash,"Adigrat University, College of Health Sciences",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051052v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051052v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

In order to provide further understanding of the transmission patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in these settings, whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on samples obtained from 8 selected outbreaks in Minnesota from March - June, 2020. WGS and phylogenetic analysis was conducted on 319 samples, constituting 14.4% of the 2,222 total SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals associated with these outbreaks. Among the sequenced specimens, three LTCFs and both correctional facilities had spread associated with a single genetic sequence. A fourth LTCF had outbreak cases associated with two distinct sequences. In contrast, cases associated with outbreaks in the two meat processing plants represented multiple SARS-CoV-2 sequences. These results suggest that a single introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into a facility can result in a widespread outbreak, and early identification and cohorting of cases, along with continued vigilance with infection prevention and control measures is imperative.","Lehnertz, N.

8499,When to relax a lockdown? A modelling-based study of testing-led strategies coupled with sero-surveillance against SARS-CoV-2 infection in India,"Indias lockdown against SARS-CoV-2, if lifted without any other mitigations in place, could risk a second wave of infection. A test-and-isolate strategy, using PCR diagnostic tests, could help to minimise the impact of this second wave. Meanwhile, population-level serological surveillance can provide valuable insights into the level of immunity in the population. Using a mathematical model, consistent with an Indian megacity, we examined how seroprevalence data could guide a test-and-isolate strategy, for lifting a lockdown. For example, if seroprevalence is 20% of the population, we show that a testing strategy needs to identify symptomatic cases within 5 - 8 days of symptom onset, in order to prevent a resurgent wave from overwhelming hospital capacity in the city. This estimate is robust to uncertainty in the effectiveness of the lockdown, as well as in immune protection against reinfection. To set these results in their economic context, we estimate that the weekly cost of such a PCR-based testing programme would be less than 2.1% of the weekly economic loss due to the lockdown. Our results illustrate how PCR-based testing and serological surveillance can be combined to design evidence-based policies, for lifting lockdowns in Indian cities and elsewhere.","Mandal, S.; Das, H.; Deo, S.; Arinaminpathy, N.",2020-05-30,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.29.20117010,1,Nimalan Arinaminpathy,Imperial College London,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.29.20117010v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.29.20117010v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
3706,Pre-outbreak determinants of perceived risks of corona infection and preventive measures taken. A prospective population-based study,"ObjectivesAssess how people perceive the risks of coronavirus infection, whether people take preventive measures, and which (pre-outbreak) factors contribute to the perceived risks and measures taken, such as (pre-outbreak) respiratory problems, heart problems, diabetes, anxiety and depression symptoms, loneliness, age, gender, marital status and education level.

MethodsData were collected in the longitudinal LISS panel, based on a random sample of the Dutch population. The coronavirus survey started on March 2, and the data collection ended on March 17 2020. Data were linked with surveys on health and social integration conducted at the end of 2019 (Nstudy sample=3,540).

ResultsAbout 15% perceived the risk of infection as high, and 11% the risk becoming ill when infected. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed the following. Older age-groups perceived the risk for coronavirus infection as lower (all adjusted Odd Ratios [aOR] [&le;] .058). In total, 43.8% had taken preventive measures, especially females (aOR=1.47, 95% CI=1.27-1.69). Those with lower education levels less often used preventive measures (aOR=0.56, 95% CI=0.46-0.69). Those with pre-outbreak respiratory problems (aOR=2.89, 95% CI=2.24-3.73), heart problems (aOR=2.17, 95% CI=1.49-3.16) and diabetes (aOR=3.10, 95% CI=2.02-4.74) perceived the risk becoming ill when infected as higher than others. However, respondents with pre-outbreak respiratory problems and diabetes did not more often take preventive measures.

ConclusionsVulnerable patients more often recognize that they are at risk becoming ill when infected by the coronavirus, but many do not take preventive measures. Interventions to stimulate the use of preventive measures should pay additional attention to physically vulnerable patients, men and those with lower education levels.","Van Der Velden, P.

25718,Racial and ethnic disparities for SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the United States: a generalizing pandemic,"The coronavirus pandemic has disproportionally impacted racial and ethnic minority communities in the United States. These disparities may be changing over time as outbreaks occur in different communities. Using electronic health record data from the Department of Veterans Affairs, we estimated odds ratios, stratified by region and time period, for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among 951,408 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 between February 12, 2020 and February 12, 2021. Our study found racial and ethnic disparities for testing positive were most pronounced at the beginning of the pandemic and decreased over time. A key finding was that the disparity among Hispanic individuals attenuated but remained elevated over the entire study period. We identified variation in racial and ethnic disparities in SARS-CoV-2 positivity by time and region independent of underlying health status and other key factors in a nationwide cohort, which provides important insight for strategies to contain and prevent further outbreaks.","Ferguson, J.

16570,Symptoms and symptom clusters associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in community-based populations: Results from a statewide epidemiological study,"BackgroundPrior studies examining symptoms of COVID-19 are primarily descriptive and measured among hospitalized individuals. Understanding symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pre-clinical, community-based populations may improve clinical screening, particularly during flu season. We sought to identify key symptoms and symptom combinations in a community-based population using robust methods.

MethodsWe pooled community-based cohorts of individuals aged 12 and older screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection in April and June 2020 for a statewide seroprevalence study. Main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for individual symptoms as well as symptom combinations. We further employed multivariable logistic regression and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine symptoms and combinations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsAmong 8214 individuals screened, 368 individuals (4.5%) were RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although two-thirds of symptoms were highly specific (>90.0%), most symptoms individually possessed a PPV <50.0%. The individual symptoms most greatly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were fever (OR=5.34, p<0.001), anosmia (OR=4.08, p<0.001), ageusia (OR=2.38, p=0.006), and cough (OR=2.86, p<0.001). Results from EFA identified two primary symptom clusters most associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: (1) ageusia, anosmia, and fever; and (2) shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. Moreover, being non-white (13.6% vs. 2.3%, p<0.001), Hispanic (27.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001), or living in an Urban area (5.4% vs. 3.8%, p<0.001) was associated with infection.

ConclusionsSymptoms can help distinguish SARS-CoV-2 infection from other respiratory viruses, especially in community or urgent care settings where rapid testing may be limited. Symptoms should further be structured in clinical documentation to support identification of new cases and mitigation of disease spread by public health. These symptoms, derived from asymptomatic as well as mildly infected individuals, can also inform vaccine and therapeutic clinical trials.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSUsing multiple journal articles queried from MEDLINE as well as a Cochrane systematic review, we examined all studies that described symptoms known to be associated with COVID-19. We further examined the guidelines from WHO and CDC on the symptoms those public health authorities consider to be associated with COVID-19. Most of the evidence comes from China, Italy, and the United States. Collectively prior research and guidance suggests there are a dozen symptoms reported by individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 in multiple countries. Symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, anosmia, ageusia, shortness of breath, chills, myalgias, headache, sore throat, chest pain, and gastrointestinal issues. The evidence is generally of low quality as it is descriptive in nature, and it is biased towards hospitalized patients. Most studies report the proportion of patients hospitalized or testing positive for infection who report one or more symptoms within 3-14 days prior to hospitalization or infection. There has been little validation of symptoms among hospitalized or non-hospitalized patients. Furthermore, according to a Cochrane review, no studies to date assess combinations of different signs and symptoms.

Added value of this studyThis study employs multiple, rigorous methods to examine the ability of specific symptoms as well as symptom combinations/groups to predict laboratory-confirmed (RT-PCR) infection of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the study is unique in its large sample drawn exclusively from community-based populations rather than hospitalized patients.

Implication of all the available evidenceCombining the evidence from this study with prior research suggests that anosmia and ageusia are key symptoms that differentiate COVID-19 from influenza-like symptoms. Clinical screening protocols for COVID-19 should look for these symptoms, which are not commonly asked of patients who present to urgent care or hospital with flu-like symptoms.

Key pointsImportant symptoms specific to COVID-19 are fever, anosmia, ageusia, and cough. Two-thirds of symptoms were highly specific (>90.0%), yet most symptoms individually possessed a PPV <50.0%. This study confirms using robust methods the key symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection, and it also identifies combinations of symptoms strongly associated with positive infection","Dixon, B.

9273,Genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 spread in Scotland highlights the role of European travel in COVID-19 emergence,"SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread rapidly throughout the world. Understanding the introductions of this new coronavirus in different settings may assist control efforts and the establishment of frameworks to support rapid response in future infectious disease outbreaks.

We investigated the first four weeks of emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Scotland after the first case reported on the 1st March 2020. We obtained full genome sequences from 452 individuals with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, representing 20% of all cases until 1st April 2020 (n=2310). This permitted a genomic epidemiology approach to study the introductions and spread of the SARS-2 virus in Scotland.

From combined phylogenetic and epidemiological analysis, we estimated at least 113 introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Scotland during this period. Clusters containing multiple sequences suggestive of onward transmission occurred in 48/86 (56%). 42/86 (51%) clusters had no known international travel history indicating undetected introductions.

The majority of viral sequences were most closely related to those circulating in other European countries, including Italy, Austria and Spain. Travel-associated introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Scotland predated travel restrictions in the UK and other European countries. The first local transmission occurred three days after the first case. A shift from travel-associated to sustained community transmission was apparent after only 11 days. Undetected introductions occurred prior to the first known case of COVID-19. Earlier travel restrictions and quarantine measures might have resulted in fewer introductions into Scotland, thereby reducing the number of cases and the subsequent burden on health services. The high number of introductions and transmission rates were likely to have impacted on national contact tracing efforts. Our results also demonstrate that local real-time genomic epidemiology can be used to monitor transmission clusters and facilitate control efforts to restrict the spread of COVID-19.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSCoronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) was first diagnosed in Scotland on the 1st of March 2020 following the emergence of the causative severe acute respiratory system coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus in China in December 2019. During the first month of the outbreak in Scotland, 2310 positive cases of COVID-19 were detected, associated with 1832 hospital admissions, 207 intensive care admissions and 126 deaths. The number of introductions into Scotland and the source of those introductions was not known prior to this study.

Added value of this studyUsing a combined phylogenetic and epidemiological approach following real-time next generation sequencing of 452 SARS-CoV-2 samples, it was estimated that the virus was introduced to Scotland on at least 113 occasions, mostly from other European countries, including Italy, Austria and Spain. Localised outbreaks occurred in the community across multiple Scottish health boards, within healthcare facilities and an international conference and community transmission was established rapidly, before local and international lockdown measures were introduced.","Filipe, A.

4985,Cluster of COVID-19 in northern France: A retrospective closed cohort study,"BackgroundThe Oise department in France has been heavily affected by COVID-19 in early 2020.

MethodsBetween 30 March and 4 April 2020, we conducted a retrospective closed cohort study among pupils, their parents and siblings, as well as teachers and non-teaching staff of a high-school located in Oise. Participants completed a questionnaire that covered history of fever and/or respiratory symptoms since 13 January 2020 and had blood tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The infection attack rate (IAR) was defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection based on antibody detection. Blood samples from two blood donor centres collected between 23 and 27 March 2020 in the Oise department were also tested for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

FindingsOf the 661 participants (median age: 37 years), 171 participants had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The overall IAR was 25.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 22.6-29.4), and the infection fatality rate was 0% (one-sided 97.5% CI = 0 - 2.1). Nine of the ten participants hospitalised since mid-January were in the infected group, giving a hospitalisation rate of 5.3% (95% CI = 2.4 -9.8). Anosmia and ageusia had high positive predictive values for SARS-CoV-2 infection (84.7% and 88.1%, respectively). Smokers had a lower IAR compared to non-smokers (7.2% versus 28.0%, P <0.001). The proportion of infected individuals who had no symptoms during the study period was 17.0% (95% CI = - 23.4). The proportion of donors with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in two nearby blood banks of the Oise department was 3.0% (95% CI = 1.1 - 6.4).

InterpretationThe relatively low IAR observed in an area where SARS-CoV-2 actively circulated weeks before confinement measures indicates that establishing herd immunity will take time, and that lifting these measures in France will be long and complex.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSThe first COVID-19 cases in France were reported on 24 January 2020. Substantial transmission has occurred since then, with the Oise department, north of Paris, one of the heaviest affected areas in the early stages of the epidemic in France. As of 13 April 2020, 98,076 cases had been diagnosed in France, including 5,379 deaths.

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been widely reported, but this has largely been centred on cases requiring medical care. What remains unclear at this stage is the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 infections may be asymptomatic or present as subclinical, non-specific symptoms. While extensive contact tracing has identified asymptomatic infections using RT-PCR testing, serologic detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is needed to determine the real infection attack rate and the proportion of all infections that are asymptomatic or subclinical.

Added value of this studyUsing a combination of serologic assays with high sensitivity and specificity for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, we conducted a retrospective closed cohort study. In a high school linked to a cluster of COVID-19 in the Oise department, we showed an overall infection attack rate (IAR) of 40.9% in the high school group, and 10.9% in parents and siblings of the pupils. The proportion of infected individuals who had no symptoms during the study period was 17.0%.

15169,A comparative study and application of modified SIR and Logistic models at Municipal Corporation level database of CoViD-19 in India,"The WHO declared a global pandemic owing to the newfound coronavirus, or Covid-19, in March 2020. The disease quickly spread around the world by contagion, and the lack of an appropriate vaccine has led to limited social activities in every track of life. Several national and state-level studies conducted predict the course of the pandemic using machine learning algorithms, most common being the SIR and the Logistic models. However, it is unclear whether these models work for a controlled community like Municipal Corporation or not. With measures now being employed at Municipal levels in India, it only fits to conduct particular research to examine how these models perform at lower jurisdictions. This study provides concrete evidence to show the superiority of the modified SIR model over the Logistic model based on analysis. The models not only give accurate predictions for up to 14 days but can also be used to define and signify the practicality and effectiveness of the decisions taken by the authorities. This feature of the study allows us to justly say that the government action of Unlock 1.0 was not a wise decision considering the nature of the pandemic. This study hopes to help the authorities to take the proper actions to prevent any further aggravation of the spreading virus. In conclusion, Municipal corporations having control should make use of this study to make decisions and test their effectiveness, and more corporations should be empowered to benefit from this study.","Bajaj, N.

14940,The influence of pH on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can infect a broad range of human tissues by using the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Individuals with comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 display higher levels of ACE2 in the lungs compared to those without comorbidities, and conditions such as cell stress, elevated glucose levels and hypoxia may also increase the expression of ACE2. Here we showed that patients with Barretts esophagus (BE) have a higher expression of ACE2 in BE tissues compared to normal squamous esophagus, and that the lower pH associated with BE may drive this increase in expression. Human primary monocytes cultured in reduced pH displayed increased ACE2 expression and viral load upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also showed in two independent cohorts of COVID-19 patients that previous use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with 2- to 3-fold higher risk of death compared to those not using the drugs. Our work suggests that pH has a great influence on SARS-CoV-2 Infection and COVID-19 severity.","Jimenez, L.; Codo, A. C.; Sampaio, V. S.; Oliveira, A. E. R.; Ferreira, L. K.; Davanzo, G.

Participants completed questionnaires and had up to five serial blood collections. Of 124 enrolled patients, only two (1.6%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on initial blood draw, and no initially seronegative patients developed newly detectable antibodies on subsequent blood draw(s), corresponding to a seroconversion rate of 0% (95%CI 0.0-4.1%) over 14.8 person-years of follow up, with a median of 13 healthcare visits per patient.

22488,"SARS-CoV-2 Shedding Dynamics Across the Respiratory Tract, Sex, and Disease Severity for Adult and Pediatric COVID-19","BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 shedding dynamics influence the risk of transmission and clinical manifestations of COVID-19. Yet, the relationships between SARS-CoV-2 shedding dynamics in the upper (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) and age, sex and COVID-19 severity remain unclear.

MethodsUsing systematic review, we developed a dataset of case characteristics (age, sex and COVID-19 severity) and quantitative respiratory viral loads (rVLs). We then conducted stratified analyses to assess SARS-CoV-2 shedding across disease course, COVID-19 severity, the respiratory tract, sex and age groups (aged 0 to 17 years, 18 to 59 years, and 60 years or older).

ResultsThe systematic dataset included 1,266 adults and 136 children with COVID-19. In the URT, adults with severe COVID-19 had higher rVLs at 1 day from symptom onset (DFSO) than adults (P = 0.005) or children (P = 0.017) with nonsevere illness. Between 1-10 DFSO, severe adults had comparable rates of SARS-CoV-2 clearance from the URT as nonsevere adults (P = 0.479) and nonsevere children (P = 0.863). In the LRT, severe adults showed higher rVLs post-symptom onset than nonsevere adults (P = 0.006). In the analyzed period (4-10 DFSO), severely affected adults had no significant trend in SARS-CoV-2 clearance from LRT (P = 0.105), whereas nonsevere adults showed a clear trend (P < 0.001). After stratifying for disease severity, sex and age (including child vs. adult) were not predictive of the duration of respiratory shedding. The estimated accuracy for using URT shedding as a prognostic indicator for COVID-19 severity was up to 65%, whereas it was up to 81% for LRT shedding.

ConclusionsHigh, persistent LRT shedding of SARS-CoV-2 characterized severe COVID-19 in adults. After symptom onset, severe cases tended to have slightly higher URT shedding than their nonsevere counterparts. Disease severity, rather than age or sex, predicted SARS-CoV-2 kinetics. LRT specimens more accurately prognosticate COVID-19 severity than do URT specimens.

InterventionStandard of care (SoC, control), SoC plus lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg lopinavir and 100 mg ritonavir every 12h for 14 days), SoC plus lopinavir/ritonavir plus IFN-{beta}-1a (44 g of subcutaneous IFN-{beta}-1a on days 1, 3, and 6), SoC plus hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice on day 1 then 400 mg once daily for 9 days) or SoC plus remdesivir (200 mg intravenously on day 1 then 100 mg once-daily for hospitalization duration or 10 days).

MeasurementsThe primary outcome was the clinical status at day 15, measured by the WHO 7-point ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 quantification in respiratory specimens and safety analyses.

ResultsAdjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) for the WHO 7-point ordinal scale were not in favor of investigational treatments: lopinavir/ritonavir versus control, aOR 0.83, 95%CI, 0.55 to 1.26, P=0.39; lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-{beta}-1a versus control, aOR 0.69, 95%CI, 0.45 to 1.04, P=0.08; hydroxychloroquine versus control, aOR 0.93, 95%CI, 0.62 to 1.41, P=0.75. No significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance in respiratory tract was evidenced. Lopinavir/ritonavir-containing treatments were significantly associated with more SAE.

LimitationsNot a placebo-controlled, no anti-inflammatory agents tested.

ConclusionNo improvement of the clinical status at day 15 nor SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance in respiratory tract specimens by studied drugs. This comforts the recent Solidarity findings.

23081,"Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 in Slovakia using a novel, multiplexed RT-qPCR assay","BackgroundThe emergence of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern called B.1.1.7 lineage sparked global alarm due to evidence of increased transmissibility, mortality, and uncertainty about vaccine efficacy, thus accelerating efforts to detect and track the variant. Current approaches to detect lineage B.1.1.7 include sequencing and RT-qPCR tests containing a target assay that fails or results in reduced sensitivity towards the B.1.1.7 variant.

AimSince many countries lack robust genomic surveillance programs and failed assays detect multiple unrelated variants containing similar mutations as B.1.1.7, we sought to develop an RT-qPCR test that can accurately and rapidly differentiate the B.1.1.7 variant from other SARS-CoV-2 variants.

MethodsWe used bioinformatics, allele-specific PCR, and judicious placement of LNA-modified nucleotides to develop a test that differentiates B.1.1.7 from other SARS-CoV-2 variants. We validated the test on 106 clinical samples with lineage status confirmed by sequencing and conducted a surveillance study of B.1.1.7 lineage prevalence in Slovakia.

ResultsOur multiplexed RT-qPCR test showed 97% clinical sensitivity at detecting lineage B.1.1.7. The assay was used in a country-wide surveillance of B.1.1.7 lineage spread in Slovakia. Retesting nearly 7,000 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples obtained during three campaigns performed within a one month period, revealed pervasive spread of B.1.1.7 with an average prevalence of 82%.

ConclusionLabs can easily implement this test to rapidly scale B.1.1.7 surveillance efforts and it is particularly useful in countries with high prevalence of variants possessing only the {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70 deletion because current strategies using target failure assays incorrectly identify these as putative B.1.1.7 variants.","Kovacova, V.; Borsova, K.; Paul, E.

22497,Mobility and COVID-19 in Andorra: Country-scale analysis of high-resolution mobility patterns and infection spread,"In the absence of effective vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as mobility restrictions, were globally adopted as critically important strategies for curbing the spread of COVID-19. However, such interventions come with immense social and economic costs and the relative effectiveness of different mobility restrictions are not well understood. This study analyzed uniquely comprehensive datasets for the entirety of a small country, consisting of serology data, telecoms data, and COVID-19 case reports, in order to examine the relationship between mobility and transmission of COVID-19.

Andorra is a small European country where tourism is a large part of the economy. Stringent mobility restrictions were put in place in Spring 2020. Additionally, 91% of the population participated in a voluntary COVID-19 serology testing programme and those data were made available for this study. Furthermore, high resolution telecoms data for the entire population were available for analysis of mobility and proximity patterns. A set of mobility metrics were developed to indicate levels of crowding, stay-at-home rates, trip-making and contact with tourists. Mobility metrics were compared to infection rates across communities and transmission rate over time.

Several of these metrics were highly correlated with transmission rate, with a lead time of approximately 18 days, with some metrics more highly correlated than others. There was a stronger correlation for measures of crowding and inter-community trip-making, and a weaker correlation for total trips (including intra-community trips) and stay-at-homes rates.","Doorley, R.

1831,Simulating and Forecasting the Cumulative Confirmed Cases of SARS-CoV-2 in China by Boltzmann Function-based Regression Analyses,"An ongoing outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is hitting Wuhan City and has spread to other provinces/cities of China and overseas. It very urgent to forecast the future course of the outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the potential total number of confirmed cases in mainland China by applying Boltzmann-function based regression analyses. We found that the cumulative number of confirmed cases from Jan 21 to Feb 14, 2020 for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City and other provinces were all well fitted with the Boltzmann function (R2 being close to 0.999). The potential total number of confirmed cases in the above geographic regions were estimated at 95% confidence interval (CI) as 79589 (71576, 93855), 64817 (58223, 77895), 46562 (40812, 57678) and 13956 (12748, 16092), respectively. Notably, our results suggest that the number of daily new confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in mainland China (including Hubei Province) will become minimal between Feb 28 and Mar 10, 2020, with 95% CI. In addition, we found that the data of cumulative confirmed cases of 2003 SARS-CoV in China and Worldwide were also well fitted to the Boltzmann function. To our knowledge this is the first study revealing that the Boltzmann function is suitable to simulate epidemics. The estimated potential total number of confirmed cases and key dates for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak may provide certain guidance for governments, organizations and citizens to optimize preparedness and response efforts.","Fu, X.; Ying, Q.; Zeng, T.; Long, T.; Wang, Y.",2020-02-20,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.02.16.20023564,2,Xinmiao Fu,Fujian Normal University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023564v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023564v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.019
19583,SARS-CoV-2 genome diversity at the binding sites of oligonucleotides used for COVID-19 diagnosis,"ImportanceSARS-CoV-2 genomic variants impacts the overall sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnosis, leading to false-negative diagnosis and the continued spread of the virus.

ObjectiveTo evaluate how nucleotide variability in target primer binding sites of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes may impact diagnosis using different recommended primer/probe sets, as well as to suggest the best primer/probes for diagnosis.

DesignWe downloaded 105,118 public SARS-CoV-2 genomes from GISAID (Sept, 25th, 2020), removed genomes of apparent worst quality (genome length <29kb and/or >5% ambiguous bases) and missing metadata, and performed an analysis of complementarity for the 13 most used diagnostic primers/probe sets for RT-PCR detection. We calculated the N rate and % of genome recovery, with all primer/probe-sets considering viral origin and clade. Results: Our findings indicate that currently, the Paris_nCoV-IP2, -IP4 and WHO|E_Sarbeco primer/probe sets for COVID-19, to perform the best diagnostically worldwide, recovering >99.5% of the good quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes from GISAID, with no mismatches. The Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP primer/probe set, among the first to be designed during the pandemic, was the most susceptible to currently most abundant SARS-CoV-2 variants. Mismatches encompassing the binding sites for this set are more frequent in Clade-GR and are highly prevalent in over 30 countries globally, including Brazil and India, two of the hardest hit countries. Conclusions: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients may be hampered by significant variability in parts of the viral genome that are targeted by some widely used primer sets. The geographic distribution of different viral clades indicates that continuous assessment of primer sets via sequencing-based surveillance and viral evolutionary analysis is critical to accurate diagnostics. This study highlights sequence variance in target regions that may reduce the efficiency of primer:target hybridization that in turn may lead to the undetected spread of the virus. As such, due to this variance, the Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP-set should be used with caution, or avoided, especially in countries with high prevalence of the GR clade.

Key Points

QuestionHow variable are the binding-sites of primers/probes used for COVID-19 diagnosis?

FindingsWe investigated nucleotide variations in primer-binding sites used for COVID-19 diagnosis, in 93,143 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, and found primer sets targeting regions of increasingly nucleotide variance over time, such as the Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP. The frequency of these variations is higher in Clade-GR whose frequency is increasing worldwide. Paris_nCoV-IP2, IP4 and WHO|E_Sarbeco performed best.

MeaningWe suggest the use of some sets to be halted and reinforce the importance of a continuous surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variations to prompt the use of the best primers.","Valieris, R.; Kowaslki, M.; Frolova, A.; Wydmanski, W.; Foox, J.; Torrezan, G.; Pospiech, E.; Branicki, W.; Venkateswaran, K.; Prithiviraj, B.; Dhamodharan, R.; Udekwu, K.; Nunes, D.; Carraro, D.; Mason, C.; Labaj, P.; Silva, I.; Dias-Neto, E.",2020-12-11,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.12.10.20236943,1,Emmanuel Dias-Neto,A.C.Camargo Cancer Center,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.20236943v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.20236943v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
5278,Comparison of Commercially Available and Laboratory Developed Assays for in vitro Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Clinical Laboratories,"Multiple laboratory developed tests and commercially available assays have emerged to meet diagnostic needs related to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To date, there is limited comparison data for these different testing platforms. We compared the analytical performance of a laboratory developed test (LDT) developed in our clinical laboratory based on CDC primer sets and four commercially available, FDA emergency use authorized assays for SARS-CoV-2 (Cepheid, DiaSorin, Hologic Panther, and Roche Cobas) on a total of 169 nasopharyngeal swabs. The LDT and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assays were the most sensitive assays for SARS-CoV-2 with 100% agreement across specimens. The Hologic Panther Fusion, DiaSorin Simplexa, and Roche Cobas 6800 only failed to detect positive specimens near the limit of detection of our CDC-based LDT assay. All assays were 100% specific, using our CDC-based LDT as the gold standard. Our results provide initial test performance characteristics for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and highlight the importance of having multiple viral detection testing platforms available in a public health emergency.","Lieberman, J.; Pepper, G.; Naccache, S.

21089,"Remote care for mental health: qualitative study with service users, carers and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic","ObjectivesTo explore the experiences of service users, carers and staff seeking or providing secondary mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic.

DesignQualitative interview study, co-designed with mental health service users and carers.

MethodsWe conducted semi-structured, telephone or online interviews with a purposively constructed sample; a peer researcher with lived experience conducted and analysed interviews with service users. Analysis was based on the constant comparison method.

SettingNHS secondary mental health services in England between June and August 2020.

ParticipantsOf 65 participants, 20 had either accessed or needed to access English secondary mental healthcare during the pandemic; 10 were carers of people with mental health difficulties; 35 were members of staff working in NHS secondary mental health services during the pandemic.

ResultsExperiences of remote care were mixed. Some service users valued the convenience of remote methods in the context of maintaining contact with familiar clinicians. Most participants commented that a lack of non-verbal cues and the loss of a therapeutic  safe space challenged therapeutic relationship building, assessments, and identification of deteriorating mental wellbeing. Some carers felt excluded from remote meetings and concerned that assessments were incomplete without their input. Like service users, remote methods posed challenges for clinicians who reported uncertainty about technical options and a lack of training. All groups expressed concern about intersectionality exacerbating inequalities and the exclusion of some service user groups if alternatives to remote care are lost.

ConclusionsWhilst remote mental healthcare is likely to become increasingly widespread in secondary mental health services, our findings highlight the continued importance of a tailored, personal approach to decisions about remote mental healthcare. Further research should focus on which types of consultations best suit face-to-face interaction, and for whom and why, and which can be provided remotely and by which medium.

3697,Flattening the curve before it flattens us: hospital critical care capacity limits and mortality from novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) cases in US counties,"BackgroundAs of March 26, 2020, the United States had the highest number of confirmed cases of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) of any country in the world. Hospital critical care is perhaps the most important medical system choke point in terms of preventing deaths in a disaster scenario such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. We therefore brought together previously established disease modeling estimates of the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic in the US under various social distancing contact reduction assumptions, with local estimates of the potential critical care surge response across all US counties.

MethodsEstimates of spatio-temporal COVID-19 demand and medical system critical care supply were calculated for all continental US counties. These estimates were statistically summarized and mapped for US counties, regions and urban versus non-urban areas. Estimates of COVID-19 infections and patients needing critical care were calculated from March 24, 2020 to April 24, 2020 for three different estimated population levels - 0%, 25%, and 50% - of contact reduction (through actions such as social distancing). Multiple national public and private datasets were linked and harmonized in order to calculate county-level critical care bed counts that included currently available beds and those that could be made available under four surge response scenarios - very low, low, medium, and high - as well as excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care.

ResultsSurge response scenarios ranged from a very low total supply 77,588 critical care beds to a high total of 278,850 critical care beds. Over the four week study period, excess deaths from inaccessible critical care ranged from 24,688 in the very low response scenario to 13,268 in the high response scenario. Northeastern and urban counties were projected to be most affected by excess deaths due to critical care shortages, and counties in New York, Colorado, and Virginia were projected to exceed their critical care bed limits despite high levels of COVID-19 contact reduction. Over the four week study period, an estimated 12,203-19,594 excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care could be averted through greater preventive actions such as travel restrictions, publicly imposed contact precautions, greater availability of rapid testing for COVID-19, social distancing, self-isolation when sick, and similar interventions. An estimated 4,029-11,420 excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care could be averted through aggressive critical care surge response and preparations, including high clearance of ICU and non-ICU critical care beds and extraordinary measures like using a single ventilator for multiple patients.

ConclusionsUnless the epidemic curve of COVID-19 cases is flattened over an extended period of time, the US COVID-19 epidemic will cause a shortage of critical care beds and drive up otherwise preventable deaths. The findings here support value of preventive actions to flatten the epidemic curve, as well as the value of exercising extraordinary surge capacity measures to increase access to hospital critical care for severely ill COVID-19 patients.","Branas, C.

25521,MORTALITY OF CARE HOME RESIDENTS AND COMMUNITY-DWELLING CONTROLS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN 2020: MATCHED COHORT STUDY,"ObjectiveTo estimate mortality of care home residents during the Covid-19 pandemic from primary care electronic health records.

DesignMatched cohort study

Setting1,421 general practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum Database in England.

Participants217,987 patients aged 18 to 104 years with recorded care home residence in England in the period 2015 to 2020. There were 86,371 care home residents contributing data in 2020, with 29,662 deaths; 83,419 (97%) were matched on age, gender and general practice with 312,607 community-dwelling adults.

Main outcome measuresAll-cause mortality. Analysis was by Poisson regression adjusting for age, gender, long-term conditions, region, year and calendar week.

ResultsThe highest first wave age-specific mortality rate was 6.02 (95% confidence interval 5.97 to 6.07) per 100 patients per week in men aged 95-104 years between 13th-19th April 2020. Compared with community-dwelling controls, the adjusted rate ratio for mortality of care home residents was 4.95 (4.62 to 5.32) in February 2020, increasing to 8.34 (7.95 to 8.74) in April 2020, declining to 3.93 (3.68 to 4.20) in December 2020. During the week of 13th to 19th April 2020, mortality of care home residents was 10.74 (9.72 to 11.85) times higher than for matched community-dwelling controls.

ConclusionsIndividual-patient data from primary care electronic health records may be used to estimate mortality in care home residents. Mortality is substantially higher than for community-dwelling comparators and showed a disproportionate increase in the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic but not the second wave. This study provides evidence to support earlier, decisive action to protect these vulnerable populations in the event of further outbreaks.

To identify genes, pathways and cell types driving MIS-C, we sequenced the blood transcriptomes of MIS-C cases, pediatric cases of coronavirus disease 2019, and healthy controls. We define a MIS-C transcriptional signature partially shared with the transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and with the signature of Kawasaki disease, a clinically similar condition. By projecting the MIS-C signature onto a co-expression network, we identified disease gene modules and found genes downregulated in MIS-C clustered in a module enriched for the transcriptional signatures of exhausted CD8+ T-cells and CD56dimCD57+ NK cells. Bayesian network analyses revealed nine key regulators of this module, including TBX21, a central coordinator of exhausted CD8+ T-cell differentiation. Together, these findings suggest dysregulated cytotoxic lymphocyte response to SARS-Cov-2 infection in MIS-C.","Beckmann, N. D.; Comella, P. H.; Cheng, E.; Lepow, L.; Beckmann, A.

7015,Saliva is less sensitive than nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 detection in the community setting,"The use of saliva collection for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics in the ambulatory setting provides several advantages when compared to nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), including ease of self-collection and reduced use of personal protective equipment (PPE). In addition saliva collection could be advantageous in advising if a convalescent patient is able to return to work after a period of self-quarantine. We investigated the utility of saliva collection in the community setting at Renown Health in a prospective Diagnostic Cohort of 88 patients and in a Convalescent Cohort of 24 patients. In the Diagnostic Cohort, we find that saliva collection has reduced sensitivity (~30% less) relative to NPS. And in our convalescent cohort of patients greater than 8 days and less than 21 days from first symptom, we find that saliva has ~ 50% sensitivity relative to NPS.

20825,Differential T cell reactivity to seasonal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 in community and health care workers,"Herein we measured CD4+ T cell responses against common cold corona (CCC) viruses and SARS-CoV-2 in high-risk health care workers (HCW) and community controls. We observed higher levels of CCC reactive T cells in SARS-CoV-2 seronegative HCW compared to community donors, consistent with potential higher occupational exposure of HCW to CCC. We further show that SARS-CoV-2 reactivity of seronegative HCW was higher than community controls and correlation between CCC and SARS-CoV-2 responses is consistent with cross-reactivity and not associated with recent in vivo activation. Surprisingly, CCC reactivity was decreased in SARS-CoV-2 infected HCW, suggesting that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 might interfere with CCC responses, either directly or indirectly. This result was unexpected, but consistently detected in independent cohorts derived from Miami and San Diego.","Da Silva Antunes, R.; Pallikkuth, S.; Williams, E.; Esther, Y.

17468,Viral genome sequencing places White House COVID-19 outbreak into phylogenetic context,"In October 2020, an outbreak of at least 50 COVID-19 cases was reported surrounding individuals employed at or visiting the White House. Here, we applied genomic epidemiology to investigate the origins of this outbreak. We enrolled two individuals with exposures linked to the White House COVID-19 outbreak into an IRB-approved research study and sequenced their SARS-CoV-2 infections. We find these viral sequences are identical to each other, but are distinct from over 190,000 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These genomes fall as part of a lineage circulating in the USA since April or May 2020 and detected in Virginia and Michigan. Looking forwards, sequencing of additional community SARS-CoV-2 infections collected in the USA prior to October 2020 may shed further light on its geographic ancestry. In sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 infections collected after October 2020, it may be possible to identify infections that likely descend from the White House COVID-19 outbreak.","Bedford, T.; Logue, J.

18057,Parents' Likelihood to Vaccinate Their Children and Themselves Against COVID-19,"BackgroundVaccination against COVID-19 will likely involve children in order to mitigate transmission risks in community settings. Successful implementation of COVID-19 immunization in the United States may hinge on factors associated with parents likelihood of immunizing their children and themselves.

MethodsWe fielded a national household survey in English and Spanish from June 5-10, 2020 (n=1,008). Parents were asked about their likelihood of immunizing their children and themselves against COVID-19. We fit separate regression models of parents likelihood to vaccinate themselves and their children against COVID-19, using bivariate and multivariable approaches in analyses weighted to be nationally representative.

ResultsOverall, 63% of parents (95% CI: 59%, 66%) were likely to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, and 60% (57%, 64%) were likely to get a vaccine themselves. These responses were highly correlated (Pearsons r=0.89). Parent age, sex, marital status, education level, and income were all associated with parents likelihood to vaccinate their children and themselves in bivariate analyses; race/ethnicity was significantly associated with parents likelihood to vaccinate their children. In multivariable analyses, younger parents were significantly less likely than older parents to vaccinate their children and themselves against COVID-19, as were parents with high school or less education compared with parents with bachelors degrees and non-Hispanic White parents compared with Hispanic parents (all p<.05).

ConclusionIn this national survey, only approximately 60% of U.S. parents stated that they are likely to vaccinate their children or themselves against COVID-19. Addressing parents hesitancy to vaccinate themselves and their children against COVID-19 will be instrumental to achieving herd immunity in the US.","Davis, M. M.; Zickafoose, J. S.; Halvorson, A.

23919,Lives Saved from Age-Prioritised COVID-19 Vaccination,"BACKGROUNDThe criteria used to allocate scarce COVID-19 vaccines are hotly contested. While some are pushing just to get vaccines into arms as quickly as possible, others advocate prioritization in terms of risk.

OBJECTIVEOur aim is to use demographic models to show the enormous potential of vaccine risk-prioritization in saving lives.

METHODSWe develop a simple mathematical model that accounts for the age distribution of the population and of COVID-19 mortality. This model considers only the direct live-savings for those who receive the vaccine, and does not account for possible indirect effects of vaccination. We apply this model to the United States, Japan, and Bangladesh.

RESULTSIn the United States, we find age-prioritization would reduce deaths during a vaccine campaign by about 93 percent relative to no vaccine and 85 percent relative to age-neutral vaccine distribution. In countries with younger age structures, such as Bangladesh, the benefits of age-prioritization are even greater.

CONTRIBUTIONFor policy makers, our findings give additional support to risk-prioritized allocation of COVID-19 vaccines. For demographers, our results show how the age-structures of the population and of disease mortality combine into an expression of risk concentration that shows the benefits of prioritized allocation. This measure can also be used to study the effects of prioritizing other dimensions of risk such as underlying health conditions.","Goldstein, J.

10205,Polymorphisms in the ACE2 Locus Associate with Severity of COVID-19 Infection,"Data from clinical studies suggests a strong association between underlying cardiometabolic disease and worse outcomes in COVID-19. Given that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has a unique marked affinity to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, one potential explanation behind this phenomenon may involve the higher expression of ACE2 receptor in these patients. Here, we analyzed association between polymorphisms in the ACE2 locus and COVID-19 severity in 62 patients found to be COVID-19 positive by polymerase chain reaction. Of these patients, 23 required hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection. Of 61 ACE2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in this patient cohort, 10 were significantly associated with tissue expression of ACE2. Logistic regression adjusted for age and for sex identified six of these ten SNPs to be significantly associated with hospitalization. These results provide preliminary evidence of a genetic link between the ACE2 genotype and COVID-19 disease severity and suggest that the ACE2 genotype may inform COVID-19 risk stratification and need for more intense therapy.","Wooster, L.; Nicholson, C.

21998,Introduction of a hand dermatitis clinic to reduce occupational dermatoses during the covid-19 pandemic.,"BackgroundThe SARS-Co-V pandemic has necessitated strict hand hygiene practices in healthcare settings. An increased incidence of staff presentations of occupational dermatitis in our institutions prompted the establishment of a drop-in access daily hand dermatitis clinic.

Objectiveto document the incidence and severity of cases of occupational dermatitis arising in healthcare workers during the first wave of the pandemic, and to reduce the impact of this with early assessment and treatment.

Methodsan open-access daily staff clinic run by dermatologists was established, and demographic and clinical data collected from each clinical encounter.

Results532 staff attended the clinic over a 6 week period. This compared to 7 staff presenting to occupational health over the same period in 2019. The majority were females 81%,and ward based 51%. ITU and A&E staff represented 15%. The prevalence of occupational hand dermatitis was 88%. 52% were classed as mild, 26% as moderate 26% and 9% severe/very severe.

Conclusionsthe pandemic and associated hand hygiene practices have led to a substantial increase in presentations of occupational hand dermatitis. A drop-in clinic proved an effective way of allowing staff to access treatment in a timely fashion.","Walsh, S.; Carey, S.",2021-02-08,Dermatology,10.1101/2021.02.04.21250767,1,Sarah Walsh,King\'s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.04.21250767v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.04.21250767v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
15809,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies among Danish and Swedish Falck emergency and non-emergency healthcare workers,"Background: Knowledge about the COVID-19 outbreak is still sparse especially in a cross-national setting. COVID-19 is caused by a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of the study is to contribute to the surveillance of the pandemic by bringing new knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers and evaluating whether certain job functions is associated with a higher risk of being infected, and to clarify if such association is mediated by the number of individuals that the employees meet during a workday. Finally, we will investigate regional and national differences in seroprevalence. Methods: A bi-national prospective observational cohort study including 3,272 adults employed at Falck in Sweden and Denmark. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies every second week for a period of 8 weeks from June 22, 2020 until August 10, 2020. Descriptive statistics as well as multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied. Results: Of the 3,272 Falck employees participating in this study, 159 (4.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroprevalence was lower among Danish Falck employees than among those from Sweden (2.8% in Denmark and 8.3% in Sweden). We also found that number of customer or patient contacts during a workday was the most prominent predictor for seropositivity, and that ambulance staff was the most vulnerable staff group. Conclusions: Our study presents geographical variations in seroprevalence within the Falck organization and shows evidence that social interaction is one of the biggest risk factors for getting infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Laursen, J.; Petersen, J.; Didriksen, M.; Iversen, K.

10726,Using past and current data to estimate potential crisis service use in mental healthcare after the COVID-19 lockdown: South London and Maudsley data,"The lockdown policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK has a potentially important impact on provision of mental healthcare with uncertain consequences over the 12 months ahead. Past activity may provide a means to predict future demand. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource at the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in south London), we carried out a range of descriptive analyses to inform the Trust on patient groups who might be most likely to require inpatient and home treatment team (HTT) crisis care. We considered the 12 months following UK COVID-19 lockdown policy on 16th March, drawing on comparable findings from previous years, and quantified levels of change in service delivery to those most likely to receive crisis care. For 12-month crisis days from 16th March in 2015-19, we found that most (over 80%) were accounted for by inpatient care (rather than HTT), most (around 75%) were used by patients who were current or recent Trust patients at the commencement of follow-up, and highest numbers were used by patients with a previously recorded schizophreniform disorder diagnosis. For current/recent patients on 16th March there had been substantial reductions in use of inpatient care in the following 31 days in 2020, more than previous years; changes in total non-inpatient contact numbers did not differ in 2020 compared to previous years, although there had been a marked switch from face-to-face to virtual contacts.","Stewart, R.; Broadbent, M.",2020-06-30,Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology,10.1101/2020.06.29.20142448,1,Robert Stewart,King\'s College London,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.20142448v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.20142448v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
7361,Factors affecting COVID-19 outcomes in cancer patients 	- A first report from Guys Cancer Centre in London,"BackgroundThere is insufficient evidence to support clinical decision-making for cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 due to the lack of large studies.

MethodsWe used data from a single large UK Cancer Centre to assess demographic/clinical characteristics of 156 cancer patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis between 29 February-12 May 2020. Logistic/Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify which demographic and/or clinical characteristics were associated with COVID-19 severity/death.

Results128 (82%) presented with mild/moderate COVID-19 and 28 (18%) with severe disease. Initial diagnosis of cancer >24m before COVID-19 (OR:1.74 (95%CI: 0.71-4.26)), presenting with fever (6.21 (1.76-21.99)), dyspnoea (2.60 (1.00-6.76)), gastro-intestinal symptoms (7.38 (2.71-20.16)), or higher levels of CRP (9.43 (0.73-121.12)) were linked with greater COVID-19 severity. During median follow-up of 47d, 34 patients had died of COVID-19 (22%). Asian ethnicity (3.73 (1.28-10.91), palliative treatment (5.74 (1.15-28.79), initial diagnosis of cancer >24m before (2.14 (1.04-4.44), dyspnoea (4.94 (1.99-12.25), and increased CRP levels (10.35 (1.0552.21)) were positively associated with COVID-19 death. An inverse association was observed with increased levels of albumin (0.04 (0.01-0.04).

ConclusionsA longer-established diagnosis of cancer was associated with increasing severity of infection as well as COVID-19 death, possibly reflecting effects of more advanced malignant disease impact on this infection. Asian ethnicity and palliative treatment were also associated with COVID-19 death in cancer patients.

Contribution to the fieldIn the context of cancer, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to challenging decision-making. These are supported by limited evidence with small case studies being reported from China, Italy, New York and a recent consortium of 900 patients from over 85 hospitals in the USA, Canada, and Spain. As a result of their limited sample sizes, most studies were not able to distinguish between the effects of age, cancer, and other comorbidities on COVID-19 outcomes. Moreover, the case series from New York analysed which patient characteristics are associated with COVID-19 death, but only made a comparison with non-cancer patients. The first results of the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium provide insights from a large cohort in terms of COVID-19 mortality, though a wide variety of institutions with different COVID-19 testing procedures were included.

Given the current lack of (inter)national guidance for cancer patients in the context of COVID-19, we believe that our large cancer centre can provide an important contribution to the urgent need for further insight into the intersection between COVID-19 and cancer. With comprehensive in-house patient details, consistent inclusion criteria and up-to-date cancer and COVID-19 outcomes, we are in position to provide rapid analytical information to the oncological community.","Russell, B.; Moss, C.; Papa, S.; Irshad, S.; Ross, P.; Spicer, J.; Kordasti, S.; Crawley, D.; Wylie, H.; Cahill, F.; Haire, A.; Zaki, K.; Rahman, F.; Lumsden, A.; Josephs, D.; Enting, D.; Lei, M.; Ghosh, S.; Harrison, C.; Swampillai, A.; Sawyer, E.; D'souza, A.; Gomberg, S.; Fields, P.; Wrench, D.; Raj, K.; Gleeson, M.; Bailey, K.; Dillon, R.; Streetly, M.; Rigg, A.; Sullivan, R.; Dolly, S.; Van Hemelrijck, M.",2020-06-09,Oncology,10.1101/2020.05.12.20094219,2,Beth Russell,King\'s College London,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20094219v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20094219v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3389/fonc.2020.01279
21566,New-Onset IgG Autoantibodies in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with a wide range of clinical manifestations, including autoimmune features and autoantibody production. We developed three different protein arrays to measure hallmark IgG autoantibodies associated with Connective Tissue Diseases (CTDs), Anti-Cytokine Antibodies (ACA), and anti-viral antibody responses in 147 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in three different centers. Autoantibodies were identified in approximately 50% of patients, but in <15% of healthy controls. When present, autoantibodies largely targeted autoantigens associated with rare disorders such as myositis, systemic sclerosis and CTD overlap syndromes. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) were observed in [~]25% of patients. Patients with autoantibodies tended to demonstrate one or a few specificities whereas ACA were even more prevalent, and patients often had antibodies to multiple cytokines. Rare patients were identified with IgG antibodies against angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2). A subset of autoantibodies and ACA developed de novo following SARS-CoV-2 infection while others were transient. Autoantibodies tracked with longitudinal development of IgG antibodies that recognized SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins such as S1, S2, M, N and a subset of non-structural proteins, but not proteins from influenza, seasonal coronaviruses or other pathogenic viruses. COVID-19 patients with one or more autoantibodies tended to have higher levels of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Nonstructural Protein 1 (NSP1) and Methyltransferase (ME). We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 causes development of new-onset IgG autoantibodies in a significant proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and are positively correlated with immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 proteins.","Chang, S.

3526,Knowledge and Beliefs towards Universal Safety Precautions to flatten the curve during Novel Coronavirus Disease (nCOVID-19) Pandemic among general Public in India: Explorations from a National Perspective,"BackgroundThe novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is being considered as the most serious health threat that the world has never witnessed in the recent times and significantly affecting the daily routine of mankind by emerging as a global pandemic. Yet, as there is no treatment nor a vaccine that was approved so far, universal safety precautions (USPs) and mitigating strategies are the only way to deal with this emergency crisis. However, knowledge and beliefs towards USPs among the general public in countries such as India with a large population are lacking.

MethodsA prospective, cross-sectional, web-based online survey was conducted among the general public in India during March 2020. A 20-item self-administered survey questionnaire was developed and randomly distributed among the public using google document forms through social media networks. Descriptive statistics were used in representing the study characteristics, and the Chi-square test was used in assessing the associations among the study variables with a p-value of < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

ResultsOf 1287 participants, 1117 have given their consent of willingness and completed the questionnaire with a response rate of 86.8%. The mean age of the study participants was 28.8 {+/-} 10.9 years, where the majority of them belong to the age category <25 years, and sex was equally distributed. Based upon the socio-demographic information, the majority were post-graduates (32.9%), professional job holders (45%) and belonged to the upper-middle (40%) economic class. Overall, the knowledge and beliefs towards USPs and mitigating strategies among participants varied between moderate to high, with statistically significant associations with their socio-demographic characteristics.

ConclusionsAlthough the knowledge and beliefs of the general public in India towards USPs are encouraging, there is a need for long-term educational interventions as the dynamics and severity of COVID-19 have been changing day-by-day rapidly. The findings of this study could guide the public health authorities in making and implementing decisions to combat this pandemic.","Gudi, S. K.; Undela, K.; Venkataraman, R.; Mateti, U.

8297,"Combining fine-scale social contact data with epidemic modelling reveals interactions between contact tracing, quarantine, testing and physical distancing for controlling COVID-19","Case isolation and contact tracing can contribute to the control of COVID-19 outbreaks1,2. However, it remains unclear how real-world networks could influence the effectiveness and efficiency of such approaches. To address this issue, we simulated control strategies for SARS-CoV-2 in a real-world social network generated from high resolution GPS data3,4. We found that tracing contacts-of-contacts reduced the size of simulated outbreaks more than tracing of only contacts, but resulted in almost half of the local population being quarantined at a single point in time. Testing and releasing non-infectious individuals led to increases in outbreak size, suggesting that contact tracing and quarantine may be most effective when it acts as a  local lockdown when contact rates are high. Finally, we estimated that combining physical distancing with contact tracing could enable epidemic control while reducing the number of quarantined individuals. Our approach highlights the importance of network structure and social dynamics in evaluating the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 control.","Firth, J. A.; Hellewell, J.; Klepac, P.; Kissler, S.

9397,Adaptive time-dependent priors and Bayesian inference to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 public health measures validated on 31 countries,"With the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus since Fall 2019, public health confinement measures to contain the propagation of the pandemic are taken. Our method to estimate the reproductive number using Bayesian inference with time-dependent priors enhances previous approaches by considering a dynamic prior continuously updated as restrictive measures and comportments within the society evolve. In addition, to allow direct comparison between reproductive number and introduction of public health measures in a specific country, the infection dates are inferred from daily confirmed cases and death with the mean time between a case being declared as positive and its death estimated on 1430 cases at 10.7 days. The evolution of the reproductive rate in combination with the stringency index is analyzed on 31 European countries. We show that most countries required tough state interventions with a stringency index equal to 83.6 out of 100 to reduce the reproductive number below one and control the progression of the epidemic. In addition, we show a direct correlation between the time taken to introduce restrictive measures and the time required to contain the spread of the epidemic with a median time of 8 days. Our analysis reinforces the importance of having a fast response with a coherent and comprehensive set of confinement measures to control the epidemic. Only combinations of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have shown to be effective.","Turbe, H.; Bjelogrlic, M.; Robert, A.; Gaudet-Blavignac, C.; Goldman, J.-P.; Lovis, C.",2020-10-02,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.10.20126870,3,Hugues Turbe,"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.10.20126870v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.10.20126870v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.3389/fpubh.2020.583401
23167,Modeling transmission dynamics and effectiveness of worker screening programs for SARS-CoV-2 in pork processing plants,"Pork processing plants were apparent hotspots for SARS-CoV2 in the spring of 2020. As a result, the swine industry was confronted with a major occupational health, financial, and animal welfare crisis. The objective of this work was to describe the epidemiological situation within processing plants, develop mathematical models to simulate transmission in these plants, and test the effectiveness of routine PCR screening at minimizing SARS-CoV2 circulation. Cumulative incidence of clinical (PCR-confirmed) disease plateaued at [~]2.5% to 25% across the three plants studied here. For larger outbreaks, antibody prevalence was approximately 30% to 40%. Secondly, we developed a mathematical model that accounts for asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and background """"community"""" transmission. By calibrating this model to observed epidemiological data, we estimated the initial reproduction number (R) of the virus. Across plants, R generally ranged between 2 and 4 during the initial phase, but subsequently declined to [~]1 after two to three weeks, most likely as a result of implementation/compliance with biosecurity measures in combination with population immunity. Using the calibrated model to simulate a range of possible scenarios, we show that the effectiveness of routine PCR-screening at minimizing disease spread was far more influenced by testing frequency than by delays in results, R, or background community transmission rates. Testing every three days generally averted about 25% to 40% of clinical cases across a range of assumptions, while testing every 14 days typically averted 7 to 13% of clinical cases. However, the absolute number of additional clinical cases expected and averted was influenced by whether there was residual immunity from a previous peak (i.e., routine testing is implemented after the workforce had experienced an initial outbreak). In contrast, when using PCR-screening to prevent outbreaks or in the early stages of an outbreak, even frequent testing may not prevent a large outbreak within the workforce. This research helps to identify protocols that minimize risk to occupational safety and health and support continuity of business for U.S. processing plants. While the model was calibrated to meat processing plants, the structure of the model and insights about testing are generalizable to other settings where large number of people work in close proximity.","Vanderwaal, K.; Black, L.; Hodge, J.; Bedada, A.; Dee, S.",2021-03-05,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.03.02.21249552,1,Kimberly Vanderwaal,University of Minnesota,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.02.21249552v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.02.21249552v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
4323,Bayesian Adaptive Clinical Trials for Anti-Infective Therapeutics during Epidemic Outbreaks,"In the midst of epidemics such as COVID-19, therapeutic candidates are unlikely to be able to complete the usual multi-year clinical trial and regulatory approval process within the course of an outbreak. We apply a Bayesian adaptive patient-centered model--which minimizes the expected harm of false positives and false negatives--to optimize the clinical trial development path during such outbreaks. When the epidemic is more infectious and fatal, the Bayesian-optimal sample size in the clinical trial is lower and the optimal statistical significance level is higher. For COVID-19 (assuming a static R0 = 2 and initial infection percentage of 0.1%), the optimal significance level is 7.1% for a clinical trial of a non-vaccine anti-infective therapeutic clinical trial and 13.6% for that of a vaccine. For a dynamic R0 ranging from 2 to 4, the corresponding values are 14.4% and 26.4%, respectively. Our results illustrate the importance of adapting the clinical trial design and the regulatory approval process to the specific parameters and stage of the epidemic.","Xu, Q.; Chaudhuri, S.; Xiao, D.; Lo, A.

4651,"Suppression of COVID-19 outbreak in the municipality of Vo, Italy","On the 21st of February 2020 a resident of the municipality of Vo, a small town near Padua, died of pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection1. This was the first COVID-19 death detected in Italy since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei province2. In response, the regional authorities imposed the lockdown of the whole municipality for 14 days3. We collected information on the demography, clinical presentation, hospitalization, contact network and presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasopharyngeal swabs for 85.9% and 71.5% of the population of Vo at two consecutive time points. On the first survey, which was conducted around the time the town lockdown started, we found a prevalence of infection of 2.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-3.3%). On the second survey, which was conducted at the end of the lockdown, we found a prevalence of 1.2% (95% CI 0.8-1.8%). Notably, 43.2% (95% CI 32.2-54.7%) of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections detected across the two surveys were asymptomatic. The mean serial interval was 6.9 days (95% CI 2.6-13.4). We found no statistically significant difference in the viral load (as measured by genome equivalents inferred from cycle threshold data) of symptomatic versus asymptomatic infections (p-values 0.6 and 0.2 for E and RdRp genes, respectively, Exact Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test). Contact tracing of the newly infected cases and transmission chain reconstruction revealed that most new infections in the second survey were infected in the community before the lockdown or from asymptomatic infections living in the same household. This study sheds new light on the frequency of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and their infectivity (as measured by the viral load) and provides new insights into its transmission dynamics, the duration of viral load detectability and the efficacy of the implemented control measures.","Lavezzo, E.; Franchin, E.; Ciavarella, C.; Cuomo-Dannenburg, G.; Barzon, L.; Del Vecchio, C.; Rossi, L.; Manganelli, R.; Loregian, A.; Navarin, N.; Abate, D.; Sciro, M.; Merigliano, S.; Decanale, E.; Vanuzzo, M.

6234,COVID-19 Pandemic Prediction for Hungary; a Hybrid Machine Learning Approach,"Several epidemiological models are being used around the world to project the number of infected individuals and the mortality rates of the COVID-19 outbreak. Advancing accurate prediction models is of utmost importance to take proper actions. Due to a high level of uncertainty or even lack of essential data, the standard epidemiological models have been challenged regarding the delivery of higher accuracy for long-term prediction. As an alternative to the susceptible-infected-resistant (SIR)-based models, this study proposes a hybrid machine learning approach to predict the COVID-19 and we exemplify its potential using data from Hungary. The hybrid machine learning methods of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multi-layered perceptron-imperialist competitive algorithm (MLP-ICA) are used to predict time series of infected individuals and mortality rate. The models predict that by late May, the outbreak and the total morality will drop substantially. The validation is performed for nine days with promising results, which confirms the model accuracy. It is expected that the model maintains its accuracy as long as no significant interruption occurs. Based on the results reported here, and due to the complex nature of the COVID-19 outbreak and variation in its behavior from nation-to-nation, this study suggests machine learning as an effective tool to model the outbreak. This paper provides an initial benchmarking to demonstrate the potential of machine learning for future research.","Pinter, G.; Felde, I.; Mosavi, A.; Ghamisi, P.; Gloaguen, R.",2020-05-06,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.05.02.20088427,1,Amir Mosavi,Obuda University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.02.20088427v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.02.20088427v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.3390/math8060890

17225,Finding the real COVID-19 case-fatality rates for SAARC countries,"Crude case fatality rate (CFR) is the most accurate when the pandemic is over. Adjustments to the crude CFR measure can better explain the pandemic situation by improving the CFR estimation. However, no study has thoroughly investigated COVID-19 adjusted CFR of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries. In this study, we estimated both survival interval and underreporting adjusted CFR of COVID-19 for the SAARC countries and observed the CFR changes due to the imposition of fees on COVID-19 tests in Bangladesh. Using the daily records up to 9th October, we implemented a statistical method to remove both the bias in crude CFR, i.e., the delay between disease onset and outcome bias and due to asymptomatic or mild symptomatic cases, reporting rates lower than 50% (95% CI: 10%-50%) bias. According to our findings, Afghanistan had the highest CFR, followed by Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Maldives, and Sri Lanka. Our estimated crude CFR varied from 3.71% to 0.29%, survival interval adjusted CFR varied from 3.77% to 0.3% and further underreporting adjusted CFR varied from 1.1% to 0.08%. We have also found that crude CFR increased from 1.261% to 1.572% after imposing the COVID-19 test fees in Bangladesh. Therefore, the authorities of countries with higher CFR should be looking for strategic counsel from the countries with lower CFR to equip themselves with the necessary knowledge to combat the pandemic. Moreover, caution is needed to report the CFR.","Shah, M. R. T.; Ahammed, T.; Anjum, A.; Chowdhury, A. A.; Suchana, A.

25437,Learning from the resilience of hospitals and their staff to the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review.,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought huge strain on hospitals worldwide. It is crucial that we gain a deeper understanding of hospital resilience in this unprecedented moment. This paper aims to report the key strategies and recommendations in terms of hospitals and professionals resilience to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the quality and limitations of research in this field at present.

MethodsWe conducted a scoping review of evidence on the resilience of hospitals and their staff during the COVID-19 crisis in the first half of 2020. The Stephen B. Thacker CDC Library website was used to identify papers meeting the eligibility criteria, from which we selected 65 publications. After having extracted data, we presented the results synthesis using an """"effects-strategies-impacts"""" resilience framework.

ResultsWe found a wealth of research rapidly produced in the first half of 2020, describing different strategies used to improve hospitals resilience, particularly in terms of 1) planning, management, and security, and 2) human resources. Research focuses mainly on interventions related to healthcare workers well-being and mental health, protection protocols, space reorganization, personal protective equipment and resources management, work organization, training, e-health and the use of technologies. Hospital financing, information and communication, and governance were less represented in the literature.

ConclusionThe selected literature was dominated by quantitative descriptive case studies, sometimes lacking consideration of methodological limitations. The review revealed a lack of holistic research attempting to unite the topics within a resilience framework. Research on hospitals resilience would benefit from a greater range of analysis to draw more nuanced and contextualized lessons from the multiple specific responses to the crisis. We identified key strategies on how hospitals maintained their resilience when confronted with the COVID-19 pandemic and a range of recommendations for practice.","Traverson, L.; Stennett, J.; Mathevet, I.; Correia Paes Zacarias, A.; Paz De Sousa, K.; Andrade, A.; Zinszer, K.; Ridde, V.",2021-04-25,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.04.22.21255908,1,Lola Traverson,"CEPED, Institute for Research on Sustainable Development, IRD-Universite de Paris, ERL INSERM SAGESU, Paris, France",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.22.21255908v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.22.21255908v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
20090,Development and external validation of a logistic regression derived formula based on repeated routine hematological measurements predicting survival of hospitalized Covid-19 patients,"BackgroundThe Covid-19 pandemic has become a global public health crisis and providing optimal patient care while preventing a collapse of the health care system is a principal objective worldwide.

ObjectiveTo develop and validate a prognostic model based on routine hematological parameters to predict uncomplicated disease progression to support the decision for an earlier discharge.

DesignDevelopment and refinement of a multivariable logistic regression model with subsequent external validation. The time course of several hematological variables until four days after admission were used as predictors. Variables were first selected based on subject matter knowledge; their number was further reduced using likelihood ratio-based backward elimination in random bootstrap samples.

SettingModel development based on three Austrian hospitals, validation cohorts from two Austrian and one Swedish hospital.

ParticipantsModel development based on 363 survivors and 78 non-survivors of Covid-19 hospitalized in Austria. External validation based on 492 survivors and 61 non-survivors hospitalized in Austria and Sweden.

OutcomeIn-hospital death.

Main ResultsThe final model includes age, fever upon admission, parameters derived from C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration, platelet count and creatinine concentration, approximating their baseline values (CRP, creatinine) and change over time (CRP, platelet count). In Austrian validation cohorts both discrimination and calibration of this model were good, with c indices of 0.93 (95% CI 0.90 - 0.96) in a cohort from Vienna and 0.93 (0.88 - 0.98) in one from Linz. The model performance seems independent of how long symptoms persisted before admission. In a small Swedish validation cohort, the model performance was poorer (p = 0.008) compared with Austrian cohorts with a c index of 0.77 (0.67 - 0.88), potentially due to substantial differences in patient demographics and clinical routine.

ConclusionsHere we describe a formula, requiring only variables routinely acquired in hospitals, which allows to estimate death probabilities of hospitalized patients with Covid-19. The model could be used as a decision support for earlier discharge of low-risk patients to reduce the burden on the health care system. The model could further be used to monitor whether patients should be admitted to hospital in countries with health care systems with emphasis on outpatient care (e.g. Sweden).","Heber, S.; Pereyra, D.; Schrottmaier, W.; Kammerer, K.; Santol, J.; Pawelka, E.; Hana, M.; Scholz, A.; Liu, M.; Hell, A.; Heiplik, K.; Lickefett, B.; Haverall, S.; Traugott, M.; Neuboeck, M.; Schoergenhofer, C.; Seitz, T.; Firbas, C.; Karolyi, M.; Weiss, G.; Jilma, B.; Thalin, C.; Bellmann-Weiler, R.; Salzer, H.; Fischer, M.

5569,"Interim Analysis of Pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Latin America and the Caribbean: Morbidity, Mortality and Molecular Testing Trends in the Region","BackgroundThe relentless advance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic has resulted in a significant burden on countries, regardless of their socio-economic conditions. The virus has infected more than 2.5 million people worldwide, causing to date more than 150,000 deaths in over 210 countries.

ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to describe the trends in cases, tests and deaths related to novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries.

MethodologyData were retrieved from the WHO-Coronavirus Disease (COVID-2019) situation reports and the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) databases from Johns Hopkins University. Descriptive statistics including death rates, cumulative mortality and incidence rates, as well as testing rates per population at risk were performed. A comparison analysis among countries with [&ge;]50 confirmed cases was performed from February 26th, 2020 to April 8th, 2020.

ResultsBrazil had the greatest number of cases and deaths in the region. Panama experienced a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases with Trinidad and Tobago, Bolivia and Honduras having the highest case fatality rates. Panama and Chile conducted more tests per million inhabitants and more tests per day per million inhabitants, followed by Uruguay and El Salvador. Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Ecuador and Brazil had the highest positive test rates.

ConclusionsThe COVID-19 disease pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has progressed rapidly in LAC countries. Some countries have been affected more severely than others, with some adopting similar disease control methods to help slow down the spread of the virus. With limited testing and other resources, social distancing is needed to help alleviate the strain on already stretched health systems.","Simbana-Rivera, K.; Gomez-Barreno, L.; Guerrero, J.; Simbana-Guaycha, F.; Fernandez, R.; Lopez-Cortes, A.; Lister, A.; Ortiz-Prado, E.",2020-04-29,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.04.25.20079863,1,Esteban Ortiz-Prado,"OneHealth Global Research Group, Universidad De Las Americas",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079863v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079863v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
8592,"Evaluating the impact of demographic, socioeconomic factors, and risk aversion on mobility during COVID-19 epidemic in France under lockdown: a population-based study","On March 17, 2020, French authorities implemented a nationwide lockdown to respond to COVID-19 epidemic and curb the surge of patients requiring critical care, similarly to other countries. Evaluating the impact of lockdown on population mobility is essential to quantify achievable reductions and identify the factors driving the changes in social dynamics that affected viral diffusion. We used temporally resolved travel flows among 1,436 administrative areas of mainland France reconstructed from mobile phone trajectories. We measured mobility changes before and during lockdown at both local and country scales. Lockdown caused a 65% reduction in countrywide number of displacements, and was particularly effective in reducing work-related short-range mobility, especially during rush hours, and recreational trips. Geographical heterogeneities showed anomalous increases in long-range movements even before lockdown announcement that were tightly localized in space. During lockdown, mobility drops were unevenly distributed across regions. They were strongly associated with active population, workers employed in sectors highly impacted by lockdown, and number of hospitalizations per region, and moderately associated with socio-economic level of the region. Major cities largely shrank their pattern of connectivity, reducing it mainly to short-range commuting. Lockdown was effective in reducing population mobility across scales. Caution should be taken in the timing of policy announcements and implementation, as anomalous mobility followed policy announcements that may act as seeding events. On the other hand, risk aversion may be beneficial in further decreasing mobility in largely affected regions. Socio-economic and demographic constraints to the efficacy of restrictions were also identified. The unveiled links between geography, demography, and timing of the response to mobility restrictions may help design interventions that minimize invasiveness while contributing to the current epidemic response.

24401,Targeting the Microbiome With KB109 in Outpatients with Mild to Moderate COVID-19 Reduced Medically Attended Acute Care Visits and Improved Symptom Duration in Patients With Comorbidities,"IntroductionIn 2020, the world experienced the beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Mounting evidence indicates that the gut microbiome plays a role in host immune response to infections and, in turn, may have an impact on the disease trajectory of SARS-CoV2 infection. However, it remains to be established whether modulation of the microbiome can impact COVID-19-related symptomatology and patient outcomes. Therefore, we conducted a study designed to modulate the microbiome evaluating the safety and physiologic effects of KB109 combined with self-supportive care (SSC) vs SSC alone in non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. KB109 is a novel synthetic glycan developed to increase the production of gut microbial metabolites that support immune system homeostasis through gut microbiome modulation. Our goal was to gain a better understanding of the safety of KB109, the natural course of COVID-19 symptomatology, and the possible role of the gut microbiome in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.

MethodsAdult patients who tested positive for COVID-19 were randomized 1:1 to receive KB109 combined with SSC or SSC alone for 14 days and were then followed for an additional 21 days (35 days in total). Patients self-assessed their COVID-19-related symptoms (8 cardinal symptoms plus 5 additional symptoms) and self-reported comorbidities. The primary and secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety of KB109 plus SSC compared with that of SSC alone and to evaluate selected measures of health, respectively.

ResultsBetween July 2, 2020 and December 23, 2020, 350 patients were randomized to receive KB109 and SSC (n=174) or SSC alone (n=176). Overall, the most common comorbidities reported were hypertension (18.0% [63/350 patients]) followed by chronic lung disease (8.6% 30/350 patients). KB109 was well tolerated with most treatment-emergent adverse events being mild to moderate in severity. The administration of KB109 plus SSC reduced medically-attended visits (ie, hospitalization, emergency room visits, or urgent care visits) by 50.0% in the overall population and by 61.7% in patients with [&ge;]1 comorbidity; in patients aged [&ge;]45 years or with [&ge;]1 comorbidity, medically-attended visits were reduced by 52.8%, In the SSC group, patients reporting [&ge;]1 comorbidity had a longer median time to resolution of symptoms than those who reported no comorbidities at baseline (13 overall symptoms: 30 vs 21 days, respectively; hazard ratio [HR]=1.163 [95% CI, 0.723-1.872]; 8 cardinal symptoms: 21 vs 15 days, respectively; HR=1.283 [95% CI, 0.809-2.035]). In patients reporting [&ge;]1 comorbidity, median time to resolution of symptoms was shorter in the KB109 plus SSC group compared with the SSC alone group (13 overall symptoms: 30 vs 21 days, respectively; HR=1.422 [95% CI, 0.898-2.250]; 8 cardinal symptoms: 17 vs 21 days, respectively; HR=1.574 [95% CI, 0.997-2.485]). In the KB109 plus SSC group, patients aged [&ge;]45 years or with [&ge;]1 comorbidity had a shorter median time to resolution of symptoms compared with SSC alone (overall 13 symptoms: 21 vs 31 days; HR=1.597 [95% CI, 1.064-2.398]).

ConclusionsResults from our study show that KB109 is well tolerated among patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Patients with [&ge;]1 comorbidity had a longer duration of COVID-19 symptoms than those without comorbidities. Moreover, in patients reporting [&ge;]1 comorbidity or aged [&ge;]45 years (at-risk population), administration of KB109 plus SSC improved median time to resolution of COVID-19-related symptoms and reduced the rate of medically-attended visits compared with SSC alone.","Haran, J.

14829,Modelling the epidemic growth of preprints on COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2,"The response of the scientific community to the global health emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has produced an unprecedented number of manuscripts in a short period of time, the vast majority of which have been shared in the form of preprints posted on online preprint repositories before peer review. This surge in preprint publications has in itself attracted considerable attention, although mostly in the bibliometrics literature. In the present study we apply a mathematical growth model, known as the generalized Richards model, to describe the time evolution of the cumulative number of COVID-19 related preprints. This mathematical approach allows us to infer several important aspects concerning the underlying growth dynamics, such as its current stage and its possible evolution in the near future. We also analyze the rank-frequency distribution of preprints servers, ordered by the number of COVID-19 preprints they host, and find that it follows a power law in the low rank (high frequency) region, with the high rank (low frequency) tail being better described by a q-exponential function. The Zipf-like law in the high frequency regime indicates the presence of a cumulative advantage effect, whereby servers that already have more preprints receive more submissions.","Vasconcelos, G.

24218,COVID-19 Vaccination Prioritization Based on Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Number-Needed-to-Vaccinate to Prevent Death,"The supply limitations of COVID-19 vaccines have led to the need to prioritize vaccine distribution. Obesity, diabetes and hypertension have been associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Approximately half as many individuals with a cardiovascular risk factor need to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to prevent related death as compared with individuals without a risk factor. Our analysis suggests that prioritizing adults with these cardiovascular risk factors for vaccination is likely to be an efficient way to reduce population COVID-19 mortality.","Leong, D.

18274,What is the relationship between validated frailty scores and mortality for adults with COVID-19 in acute hospital care? A systematic review.,"Background & aimThe aim of this systematic review was to quantify the association between frailty and COVID-19 in relation to mortality in hospitalised patients.

MethodsMedline, Embase, Web of Science and the grey literature were searched for papers from inception to 10th September 2020; the search was re-run in Medline up until the 9th December 2020. Screening, data extraction and quality grading were undertaken by two reviewers. Results were summarised using descriptive statistics, including a meta-analysis of overall mortality; the relationships between frailty and COVID-19 mortality were summarised narratively.

Results2286 papers were screened resulting in 26 being included in the review. Most studies were from Europe, half from the UK, and one from Brazil; the median sample size was 242.5, median age 73.1 and 43.5% were female. 22/26 used the Clinical Frailty Scale; reported mortality ranged from 14 to 65%. Most, but not all studies showed an association between increasing frailty and a greater risk of dying. Two studies indicated a sub-additive relationship between frailty, COVID-19 and death, and two studies showed no association.

ConclusionsWhilst the majority of studies have shown a positive association between COVID-19 related death and increasing frailty, some studies suggested a more nuanced understanding of frailty and outcomes in COVID-19 is needed. Clinicians should exert caution in placing too much emphasis on the influence of frailty alone when discussing likely prognosis in older people with COVID-19 illness.

11519,State-level tracking of COVID-19 in the United States,"As of 1st June 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 104,232 confirmed or probable COVID-19-related deaths in the US. This was more than twice the number of deaths reported in the next most severely impacted country. We jointly modelled the US epidemic at the state-level, using publicly available death data within a Bayesian hierarchical semi-mechanistic framework. For each state, we estimate the number of individuals that have been infected, the number of individuals that are currently infectious and the time-varying reproduction number (the average number of secondary infections caused by an infected person). We used changes in mobility to capture the impact that non-pharmaceutical interventions and other behaviour changes have on the rate of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Nationally, we estimated 3.7% [3.4%-4.0%] of the population had been infected by 1st June 2020, with wide variation between states, and approximately 0.01% of the population was infectious. We also demonstrated that good model forecasts of deaths for the next 3 weeks with low error and good coverage of our credible intervals.","Unwin, H. J. T.; Mishra, S.; Bradley, V.

9571,Self-reported changes in energy balance behaviors during COVID-19 related home confinement: A Cross-Sectional Study,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused people to shelter-at-home for an extended period, resulting in a sudden rise in unstructured time. This unexpected disruption in everyday life has raised concerns about weight management, especially in high-risk populations of women and individuals with overweight and obesity. This study aimed to investigate the changes in behaviors that may impact energy intake and/or energy expenditure in U.S. adults during the home confinement.

MethodsCross-sectional data from 1,779 adults were collected using an online Qualtrics survey between April 24th and May 4th, 2020. Self-reported data on demographics, eating behaviors, physical activity, sleep, screen time, takeout food intake, and food purchasing behaviors were collected. Chi-Square analyses were conducted to evaluate differences in the percent of participants reporting increasing, decreasing, or staying the same in each health behavior since the COVID-19 outbreak in their area. Each analysis was followed by comparing whether increases or decreases were more likely for each health behavior. Similar comparisons were made between male and female participants and between body mass index (BMI) categories.

ResultsWe observed an increase in the intake of both healthy and energy-dense unhealthy foods and snacks during the home confinement. Participants also reported increases in sedentary activities and decrease in physical activity, alcohol intake, and consumption of takeout meals during this time. In women, several behavioral changes support greater energy intake and less energy expenditure than men. No clear difference in patterns was observed across BMI status.

ConclusionAcute changes in behaviors underscore the significance of a sudden increase in unstructured time at home on potential weight gain. Our findings support the need to implement and support measures that promote strategies to maintain body weight and establish a methodology to collect body weight data at multiple time points to longitudinally assess the dynamic relationship between behaviors and body weight change.","Bhutani, S.; Cooper, J.

2366,"Estimating the scale of COVID-19 Epidemic in the United States: Simulations Based on Air Traffic directly from Wuhan, China","IntroductionCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has been characterized by rapid spread and unusually large case clusters. It is important to have an estimate of the current state of COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. to help develop informed public health strategies.

MethodsWe estimated the potential scale of the COVID-19 epidemic (as of 03/01/2020) in the U.S. from cases  imported directly from Wuhan area. We used simulations based on transmission dynamics parameters estimated from previous studies and air traffic data from Wuhan to the U.S and deliberately built our model based on conservative assumptions. Detection and quarantine of individual COVID-19 cases in the U.S before 03/01/2020 were also taken into account. A SEIR model was used to simulate the growth of the number of infected individuals in Wuhan area and in the U.S.

ResultsWith the most likely model, we estimated that there would be 9,484 infected cases (90%CI 2,054-24,241) as of 03/01/2020 if no successful intervention procedure had been taken to reduce the transmissibility in unidentified cases. Assuming current preventive procedures have reduced 25% of the transmissibility in unidentified cases, the number of infected cases would be 1,043 (90%CI 107-2,474).

ConclusionOur research indicates that, as of 03/01/2020., it is likely that there are already thousands of individuals in the US infected with SARS-CoV-2. Our model is dynamic and is available to the research community to further evaluate as the situation becomes clearer.","Li, D.; Lv, J.; Botwin, G.; Braun, J.; Cao, W.; Li, L.; Mcgovern, D. P.

17856,"Community health worker knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19: learnings from an online cross-sectional survey using a digital health platform, UpSCALE, in Mozambique","Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the frontline of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic response, yet there is a paucity of literature on their knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) in relation to the pandemic. Community Health Workers (CHWs) in Mozambique are known locally as agentes polivalentes elementares (APEs). While technical guidance surrounding COVID-19 is available to support APEs, communicating this information has been challenging due to restrictions on travel, face-to-face group meetings and training, imposed from May to August 2020. A digital health platform, upSCALE, that already supports 1,213 APEs and 299 supervisors across three provinces, is being used to support APEs on effective COVID-19 management by delivering COVID-19 sensitive SMS messages, training modules and a COVID-19 KAP survey.

The KAP survey, conducted from June 2020 to August 2020, consisted of 10 questions. Of 1,065 active upSCALE APEs, 28 percent completed the survey. Results indicate that only a small proportion of APEs listed the correct COVID-19 symptoms, transmission routes and appropriate prevention measures (25 percent, 16 percent and 39 percent, respectively) specifically included in national health education materials. Misconceptions were mainly related to transmission routes, high risk individuals and asymptomatic patients. 84 percent said they followed all government prevention guidelines. The results from the KAP survey were used to support the rapid development and deployment of targeted COVID-19 awareness and education materials for the APEs. SMS messages were continually adjusted based on the KAP survey results and a series of seven COVID-19 training modules were developed and disseminated. A follow-up KAP survey is planned for November 2020.

Adapting the existing upSCALE platform enabled a better understanding, in real time, of the KAP of APEs around COVID-19 management. Subsequently, supported improved delivery of tailored messages and education, vital for ensuring a successful COVID-19 response.","Feldman, M.; Lacey Krylova, V.; Farrow, P.; Donovan, L.; Zandamela, E.; Rebelo, J.; Rodrigues, M.; Bulo, A.; Ferraz, C.; Romero Gonzalez, J.; Rodrigues, H.; Roca-Feltrer, A.; Baker, K.",2020-11-06,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.11.05.20216606,1,Kevin Baker,Malaria Consortium,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.05.20216606v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.05.20216606v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1371/journal.pone.0244924
16990,Analytical evaluation and critical appraisal of early commercial SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays for routine use in a diagnostic laboratory.,"BACKGROUNDThe objective of this study was to evaluate the performance characteristics of early commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays in mild and asymptomatic subjects to enable the selection of suitable serological assays for routine diagnostic use within HCA Healthcare UK.

METHODSWe used serum samples from a pre-Covid era patient cohort (n=50, pre-December 2019), designated SARS-CoV-2 negative, and serum samples from a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive cohort (n=90) taken > 14 days post symptom onset (April-May 2020). We evaluated 6 ELISA assays including one confirmation assay to investigate antibody specificity. We also evaluated one point-of-care lateral flow device and one high throughput electrochemiluminescence immunoassay.

RESULTSThe ELISA specificities ranged from 84-100%, with sensitivities ranging from 75.3-90.0%. The LFIA showed 100% specificity and 80% sensitivity using smaller sample numbers. The Roche CLIA immunoassay showed 100% specificity and 90.7% sensitivity. When used in conjunction, the Euroimmun nucleocapsid (NC) and spike-1 (S1) IgG ELISA assays had a sensitivity of 95.6%. The confirmation IgG assay showed 92.6% of samples tested contained both NC and S1 antibodies, 32.7% had NC, S1 and S2 and 0% had either S1 or S2 only.

CONCLUSIONSThese first generation assays were not calibrated against reference material and the results are reported qualitatively. The Roche assay and the Euroimmun NC and S1 assays had the best sensitivity overall in our hands. Combining the assays detecting NC and S1/S2 antibody increased diagnostic yield. A portfolio of next generation SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays will be necessary in any future studies of herd and vaccine induced immunity.","Cramer, A.; Goodman, N.; Cross, T.; Gant, V.

6379,Efficacy of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients with a simulated two-arm controlled study,"While the recent study on the compassionate use of remdesivir for COVID-19 patients has shown a 68% clinical improvement7 it is a one-arm study that renders the evaluation of the efficacy in reducing death and the length of stay of hospitalization intractable due to a lacking of the control group. We came up with a two-arm controlled study design to simulate the treated and the untreated (control group) group by applying two respective transition models to the empirical data on dynamics of the disease severity (Figure 2 of the original article7) that are classified into low- (no and low oxygen supplement), medium- (non-invasive ventilator and high oxygen supplement), and high-(ECMO and invasive ventilator) from enrolment until discharge, death or the end of follow-up. By using a simulated two-arm controlled study, the remdesivir treatment group as opposed to the control group led to a statistically significantly 29% (95% CI: 22-35%) reduction of death from COVID-19. The treated group also revealed a 33% (95% CI 28-38%) significantly higher odds of discharge than the control group. The median time to discharge for the treated group (5.5 days, 16.5 days, and 29.5 days for low-, medium-, and high-risk state, respectively) was around half of those of the control arm. Our results with a simulated two-arm controlled study have not only corroborated the efficacy of remdesivir but also made great contribution to designing a further large-scale randomized controlled trial. They have significant implications for reducing transmission probability and infectious time of COVID-19 patients when contacting with susceptible health care workers during hospitalization.

4266,"The Epidemiological Implications of Incarceration Dynamics in Jails for Community, Corrections Officer, and Incarcerated Population Risks from COVID-19","COVID-19 is challenging many societal institutions, including our criminal justice systems. Some have proposed or enacted (e.g. the State of New Jersey) reductions in the jail and/or prison populations. We present a mathematical model to explore the epidemiological impact of such interventions in jails and contrast them with the consequences of maintaining unaltered practices. We consider infection risk and likely in-custody deaths, and estimate how within-jail dynamics lead to spill-over risks, not only affecting incarcerated people, but increasing exposure, infection, and death rates for both corrections officers, and the broader community beyond the justice system. We show that, given a typical jail-community dynamic, operating in a business-as-usual way will result in significant and rapid loss of life. Large scale reductions in arrest and speeding of releases are likely to save the lives of incarcerated people, jail staff, and the community at large.","Lofgren, E.; Lum, K.; Horowitz, A.; Madubuonwu, B.; Myers, K.; Fefferman, N.",2021-01-07,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.08.20058842,3,Nina Fefferman,University of Tennessee,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058842v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058842v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

Whether the pandemic could change the association between cold temperature and mortality remains unknown. Objectives: We aimed to assess whether the association between cold temperature and all-cause mortality in the pandemic period has changed compared to non-COVID-19 period (2015-2019) in Italy. Methods: We collected daily all-cause mortality data and meteorological data for 107 Italian provinces from 1, January 2015 to 31, May 2020. A time-stratified case-crossover design with the distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine the association between cold temperature and all-cause mortality during the first three months (from March to May in 2020) of the COVID-19 outbreak and the same months in 2015-2019. Results: The relative risk (RR) of all-cause mortality at extreme cold temperature (2.5th percentile of temperature at 3 {degrees}C) in comparison with the minimum mortality temperature (24 {degrees}C) was 4.75 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.90-5.79] in the pandemic period, which is more than triple higher than RR [1.41 (95%CI: 1.33-1.50)] in the same months during 2015-2019. The shift in cold-mortality association was particularly significant for people aged 65-74 years [RR (95%CI): 5.98 (3.78-9.46) in 2020 versus 1.29 (1.10-1.51) in 2015-2019], 75-84 years [5.25 (3.79-7.26) versus 1.40 (1.25-1.56)], and [&ge;] 85 years [5.03 (3.90-6.51) versus 1.52 (1.39-1.66)], but not significant for those aged 0-64 years [1.95 (1.17-3.24) versus 1.24 (1.05-1.48)]. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic enhanced the risk of cold temperature on mortality in Italy, particularly among the elderly people.

5946,A cohort of patients with COVID-19 in a major teaching hospital in Europe,"BACKGROUNDSince the confirmation of the first patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Spain in January 2020, the epidemic has grown rapidly, with the greatest impact on the Madrid region. This article describes the first 2226 consecutive adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to the La Paz University Hospital in Madrid.

METHODSOur cohort included all consecutively admitted patients who were hospitalized and who had a final outcome (death or discharge) in a 1286-bed hospital of Madrid (Spain) from February 25th (first case admitted) to April 19th, 2020. Data was entered manually into an electronic case report form, which was monitored prior to the analysis.

RESULTSWe consecutively included 2226 adult patients admitted to the hospital who either died (460) or were discharged (1766). The patients median age was 61 years; 51.8% were women. The most common comorbidity was arterial hypertension (41.3%). The most common symptom on admission were fever (71.2%). The median time from disease onset to hospital admission was 6 days. Overall mortality was 20.7% and was higher in men (26.6% vs 15.1%). Seventy-five patients with a final outcome were transferred to the ICU (3.4%). Most patients admitted to the ICU were men, and the median age was 64 years. Baseline laboratory values on admission were consistent with an impaired immune-inflammatory profile.

CONCLUSIONSWe provide a description of the first large cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Europe. Advanced age, male gender, the presence of comorbidities and abnormal laboratory values were more common among the patients with fatal outcomes.","Borobia, A. M.; Carcas, A.

9099,Anemia and iron metabolism in COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Iron metabolism and anemia may play an important role in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). If confirmed, this has important implications for the more than 1.62 billion people estimated to have anemia globally. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate biomarkers of anemia and iron metabolism (hemoglobin, ferritin, transferrin, soluble transferrin receptor, hepcidin, haptoglobin, unsaturated iron-binding capacity, erythropoietin, free erythrocyte protoporphyrine, and prevalence of anemia) in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and explore their prognostic value. Six bibliographic databases were searched up to May 5th 2020. We included 56 unique studies, with data from 14,044 COVID-19 patients (59 years median age). Pooled mean hemoglobin and ferritin levels in COVID-19 patients across all ages were 130.41 g/L (95% Confidence Interval (CI), 128.42; 132.39) and 673.91 ng/mL (95% CI, 420.98; 926.84), respectively. Hemoglobin levels decreased with advancing age and increasing percentage of comorbid and critically ill patients, while levels of ferritin increased with increasing male proportion and mean hemoglobin levels. Compared to moderate cases, severe cases had lower pooled mean hemoglobin [weighted mean difference (WMD), -4.21 (95% CI -6.63; -1.78)] and higher ferritin [WMD, -730.55 ng/mL (95% CI 413.24; 1047.85)]. A significant difference in mean ferritin level of 1027.23 ng/mL (95% CI 819.53; 1234.94) was found between survivors and non-survivors, but not in hemoglobin levels. No studies provided information on anemia or other biomarkers of interest. Future studies should explore the impact of iron metabolism and anemia and in the pathophysiology, prognosis, and treatment of COVID-19.","Taneri, P. E.; Gomez-Ochoa, S. A.; Llanaj, E.; Raguindin, P.

2204,Precautions are Needed for COVID-19 Patients with Coinfection of Common Respiratory Pathogens,"BackgroundWith the ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), infected patients within and beyond the epidemic area, Wuhan, China, showed different epidemiological and clinical characteristics. There is a paucity of data concerning coinfection with other common respiratory pathogens in COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan.

MethodsWe conducted a double-centre study recruiting 68 patients with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing in Qingdao and Wuhan from January 17 to February 16, 2020. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed to detect the specific IgM antibody against common respiratory pathogens in collected acute phase serum.

ResultsOf the 68 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 30 (44.12%) were from Qingdao. The median age of Qingdao and Wuhan patients were 50 (IQR: 37-59) and 31 (IQR: 28-38) years, respectively, and the majority of patients were female in Qingdao (60.00%) and Wuhan (55.26%). Among COVID-19 patients in Qingdao, 24 (80.00%) of them had IgM antibodies against at least one respiratory pathogen, whereas only one (2.63%) of the patients in Wuhan had positive results for serum IgM antibody detection (P<0.0001). The most common respiratory pathogens detected in Qingdao COVID-19 patients were influenza virus A (60.00%) and influenza virus B (53.33%), followed by mycoplasma pneumoniae (23.33%) and legionella pneumophila (20.00%). While the pattern for coinfection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Qingdao was quite different, with a positive rate of only 20.90%.

InterpretationWe reported a large proportion of COVID-19 patients with coinfection of seasonal respiratory pathogens in Qingdao, northeast China, which differed greatly from the patients in Wuhan, central China. Precautions are needed when dealing with COVID-19 patients beyond the epidemic centre who have coinfection with other respiratory pathogens. We highly recommend adding SARS-CoV-2 to routine diagnostic testing in capable hospitals to prevent misdetection of the virus.","Xing, Q.; Li, G.; Xing, Y.; Chen, T.; Li, W.; Ni, W.; Deng, K.; Gao, R.; Chen, C.; Gao, Y.; Li, Q.; Yu, G.; Tong, J.; Li, W.; Hao, G.; Sun, Y.; Zhang, A.; Wu, Q.; Li, Z.; Pan, S.",2020-03-05,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.02.29.20027698,2,Quansheng Xing,Qingdao Women and Children\'s Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20027698v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20027698v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
15963,Estimation of novel coronavirus (covid-19) reproduction number and case fatality rate: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Understanding the transmission dynamics and the severity of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) informs public health interventions, surveillance, and planning. Two important parameters, the basic reproduction number (R0) and case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19, help in this understanding process. The objective of this study was to estimate the R0 and CFR of COVID-19 and assess whether the parameters vary in different regions of the world. We carried out a systematic review to retrieve the published estimates of the R0 and the CFR in articles from international databases between 1st January and 31st August 2020. Random-effect models and Forest plots were implemented to evaluate the mean effect size of the R0 and the CFR. Furthermore, the R0 and CFR of the studies were quantified based on geographic location, the tests/thousand population, and the median population age of the countries where studies were conducted. The I2 statistic and the Cochrans Q test were applied to assess statistical heterogeneity among the selected studies. Forty-five studies involving R0 and thirty-four studies involving CFR were included. The pooled estimation of the R0 was 2.69 (95% CI: 2.40, 2.98), and that of the CFR was 2.67 (2.25, 3.13). The CFR in different regions of the world varied significantly, from 2.51 (2.12, 2.95) in Asia to 7.11 (6.38, 7.91) in Africa. We observed higher mean CFR values for the countries with lower tests (3.15 vs. 2.16) and greater median population age (3.13 vs. 2.27). However, the R0 did not vary significantly in different regions of the world. An R0 of 2.69 and CFR of 2.67 indicate the severity of the COVID-19. Although R0 and CFR may vary over time, space, and demographics, we recommend considering these figures in control and prevention measures.","Ahammed, T.; Anjum, A.; Rahman, M.

14644,Strategies for exiting COVID-19 lockdown for workplace and school: a scoping review protocol,"ObjectiveThe main objectives of this review are to summarise the existing literature and to identify strategies for exiting lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on reopening schools and returning to work.

IntroductionAfter months of strict quarantine, several countries are planning exit strategies to progressively lift social restrictions without giving rise to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Although several strategies have been studied in terms of how and when to relax such stringent constraints, there is a lack of consensus on the optimal strategy for managing the pandemic beyond lockdown. The risks posed by delaying return to work and school openings are real and sizeable, particularly for relevant working sectors and for students from low-income families

Inclusion criteriaThis review will consider studies that focussed on relaxation strategies for lockdown exit among workers and students facing an epidemic /pandemic crisis.

MethodsThe searches will be conducted across four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciSearch, Google Scholar), and the bibliography of all selected studies will be hand-searched. In addition, because the topic is new, relevant literature will be checked using daily, updated COVID-19 collections from NCBI (LitCovid) and MedRxiv servers. Studies published in English, German, Spanish, Italian and French will be included, with no limits on publication dates. This review will consider all study designs, regardless of their rigor. The review method will be based on a two-phase approach: a title and abstract screening, and a full-text review performed by two independent researchers. Data will be summarised and categorised, and results will be presented in a tabular/diagrammatic form.","D'angelo, D.; Coclite, D.; Napoletano, A.; Fauci, A.

13132,A Classification Approach for Predicting COVID-19 Patient Survival Outcome with Machine Learning Techniques,"COVID-19 is an infectious disease discovered after the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 is still becoming an increasing global threat to public health. The virus has been escalated to many countries across the globe. This paper analyzed and compared the performance of three different supervised machine learning techniques; Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) on COVID-19 dataset. The best level of accuracy between these three algorithms was determined by comparison of some metrics for assessing predictive performance such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-score, Kappa index, and ROC. From the analysis results, RF was found to be the best algorithm with 100% prediction accuracy in comparison with LDA and SVM with 95.2% and 90.9% respectively. Our analysis shows that out of these three classification models RF predicts COVID-19 patients survival outcome with the highest accuracy. Chi-square test reveals that all the seven features except sex were significantly correlated with the COVID-19 patients outcome (P-value < 0.005). Therefore, RF was recommended for COVID-19 patients outcome prediction that will help in early identification of possible sensitive cases for quick provision of quality health care, support and supervision.","Osi, A.

13169,Salivary anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA as an accessible biomarker of mucosal immunity against COVID-19.,"BackgroundMucosal immunity, including secretory IgA (sIgA), plays an important role in early defenses against respiratory pathogens. Salivary testing, the most convenient way to measure sIgA, has been used to characterize mucosal immune responses to many viral infections including SARS, MERS, influenza, HIV, and RSV. However, its role has not yet been characterized in the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we report development and validation of a rapid immunoassay for measuring salivary IgA against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and report quantitative results in both pre-COVID-19 and muco-converted subjects.

MethodsWe developed and refined a specific test for salivary IgA against SARS-CoV-2 on the Brevitest platform, a rapid immunoassay system designed for point-of-care use. A qualitative test was validated as per FDA guidelines with saliva obtained from subjects prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. We also generated a quantitative measure of anti-SARS-CoV-2 salivary IgA. Time taken for saliva self-collection was measured and its ease-of-use assessed.

ResultsWe successfully validated a qualitative salivary assay for SARS-CoV-2 IgA antibodies, with positive and negative predictive values of 92% and 97%, respectively, and no observable cross-reactivity with any of seven potential confounders. Pre-COVID-19 saliva samples showed an 8-fold range of IgA concentrations, suggesting a broad continuum of natural antibody resistance against the novel virus, though at levels lower than that observed in COVID-19 PCR-confirmed subjects. Samples from muco-positive subjects also shown a ~9-fold variation in salivary IgA levels, with elevated salivary IgA observed beyond three months after onset of symptoms. We observed a correlation (r=0.4405) between salivary IgA levels and COVID-19 disease severity. In anecdotal observations, we observed individuals who exhibited antibodies early in the course of their disease, contemporaneously with a positive PCR test, as well as individuals who muco-converted despite no known direct exposure to a COVID-19 patient, no symptoms, and negative molecular and/or serum antibody tests. Salivary collection took 5-10 minutes, and was reported as being easy (mean of 1.1 on a scale of 1 to 10).

ImplicationsMucosal immunity, including secretory IgA, plays an important role in host defense against respiratory pathogens, and our early data suggest it may do so in COVID-19. Salivary IgA, an accessible marker of mucosal immunity, may be a useful indicator of several key parameters including individual and community immune response, disease severity, clinical risk, and herd immunity. The non-invasive nature and ease of saliva collection facilitates its potential use as a biomarker for ongoing patient assessment and management, as well as a community surveillance tool. By measuring mucosal immune responses directly and systemic immune responses indirectly, salivary IgA could be useful in developing and deploying a vaccine(s) against COVID-19. Quantitative IgA assessment could also potentially serve as a tool to segment the population into different risk categories and inform individual and collective decisions relating to appropriate activities and vaccine prioritization/delivery. These data reinforce the importance of further investigation into the role of mucosal immunity and IgA in host responses against COVID-19.","Varadhachary, A.; Chatterjee, D.; Garza, J.; Garr, R.

9393,Plasma from recovered COVID19 subjects inhibits spike protein binding to ACE2 in a microsphere-based inhibition assay,"High throughput serological tests that can establish the presence and functional activity of anti-SARS-COV2 antibodies are urgently needed. Here we present microsphere-based Flow Cytometry assays that quantify both anti-spike IgGs in plasma, and the ability of plasma to inhibit the binding of spike protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). First, we detected anti-spike-trimer IgGs in 22/24 and anti-spike-receptor-binding-domain (RBD) IgGs in 21/24 COVID+ subjects at a median of 36 (range 14-73) days following documented SARS-CoV-2 RNA (+) secretions. Next, we find that plasma from all 22/24 subjects with anti-trimer IgGs inhibited ACE2-trimer binding to a greater degree than controls, and that the degree of inhibition correlated with anti-trimer IgG levels. Depletion of trimer-reactive Igs from plasma reduced ACE2-trimer inhibitory capacity to a greater degree than depletion of RBD-reactive Igs, suggesting that inhibitory antibodies act by binding both within and outside of the RBD. Amongst the 24 subjects, presence of fever was associated with higher levels of anti-trimer IgG and inhibition of binding to human ACE2. This inhibition assay may be broadly useful to quantify the functional antibody response of recovered COVID19 patients or vaccine recipients in a cell-free assay system.","Gniffke, E.

19891,Current evidence for COVID-19 therapies: a systematic literature review,"Effective therapeutic interventions for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 are urgently needed. A systematic review was conducted to identify clinical trials of pharmacological interventions for COVID-19 published between 1 December 2019 and 14 October 2020. Data regarding efficacy of interventions, in terms of mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation, were extracted from identified studies and synthesised qualitatively.

In total, 42 clinical trials were included. Interventions assessed included antiviral, mucolytic, anti-malarial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapies. Some reductions in mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation were seen with interferons and remdesivir, particularly when administered early, and with the mucolytic drug, bromhexine. Most studies of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine did not show significant efficacy over standard care/placebo. Dexamethasone significantly reduced mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation versus standard care, particularly in patients with severe disease. Evidence for other classes of interventions was limited. Many trials had a moderate-to-high risk of bias, particularly in terms of blinding; most were short-term; and some included low patient numbers.

This review highlights the need for well-designed clinical trials of therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 to increase the quality of available evidence. It also emphasises the importance of tailoring interventions to disease stage and severity for maximum efficacy.","Welte, T.; Ambrose, L. J.; Sibbring, G.

4863,A Global Scale Estimate of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases Using Extreme Value Distributions,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis and the governments are fighting rigorously to control the spread by imposing intervention measures and increasing the medical facilities. In order to tackle the crisis effectively we need to know the trajectories of number of the people infected (i.e. confirmed cases). Such information is crucial to government agencies for developing effective preparedness plans and strategies. We used a statistical modeling approach - extreme value distributions (EVDs) for projecting the future confirmed cases on a global scale. Using the 69 days data (from January 22, 2020 to March 30, 2020), the EVDs model predicted the number of confirmed cases from March 31, 2020 to April 9, 2020 (validation period) with an absolute percentage error < 15 % and then projected the number of confirmed cases until the end of June 2020. Also, we have quantified the uncertainty in the future projections due to the delay in reporting of the confirmed cases on a global scale. Based on the projections, we found that total confirmed cases would reach around 11.4 million globally by the end of June 2020.The USA may have 2.9 million number of confirmed cases followed by Spain-1.52 million and Italy-1.28 million.","Aadhityaa, M.; Kasiviswanathan, K.; Ilampooranan, I.; Soundharajan, B.; Balamurugan, M.; He, J.",2020-04-22,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.17.20069500,1,Ks Kasiviswanathan,"Department of Water Resources Development and Management, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069500v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069500v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
7265,Is it Just About Physical Health? An Online Cross-Sectional Study Exploring the Psychological Distress Among University Students in Jordan in the midst of COVID-19 Pandemic,"BackgroundSince the spread of COVID-19 on a global scale, most of efforts at the local, national, and international levels were directed primarily to mitigate the spread of the disease. However, the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on global mental health were not thoroughly investigated yet, and studies that report the mental health risks of COVID-19 are still scarce.

ObjectivesThis study aimed to assess the level of psychological distress among university students in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated national measures.

MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire, The survey comprised of questions about (i) sociodemographic information, (ii) the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), (iii) coping activities, and (iv) the students greatest concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic.

ResultsA total of 381 completed questionnaires were included in the analysis. Female participants slightly predominated the sample (n = 199, 52.2%). The respondents aged 18-38 years (mean 22.6 years, SD: 3.16). The total K10 distress scores had a mean of 34.2 (SD:9.4). However, the mean of total K10 distress scores had no significant association with gender (P = 0.57). Age was negatively associated with total K10 distress score (P = 0.0013). Concerning severity, most of respondents were regarded as having severe psychological distress (n = 265, 69.5%), and females were found to have a statistically significant higher percentage in mild and severe psychological distress (P = 0.035), (P = 0.016); respectively. 209 students (54.9%) reported that they had no motivation for distance learning. There was a statistically significant inverse relationship between severe psychological distress and motivation for distance learning (P<0.0001). The most common coping strategy among students was spending more time on social media (n = 269, 70.6%). Besides, 49 students (12.9%) reported the use of medications to cope with COVID-10 related distress, and 209 students (54.9%) reported distance learning was their most serious concern.

ConclusionThe COVID-19 control measures resulted in a severe disruption of various human life activities, and this could impact the mental health of individuals, including students. A nationwide psychological support program should be incorporated into Jordans response strategy in combating the COVID-19, considering students and other vulnerable groups in Jordan.","Al-Tammemi, A.

Monocytes from all COVID-19 patients were CD16+ pro-inflammatory monocytes. Neutrophils were mature and functional. No defect has been found in ROS production of monocytes and neutrophils as well as no defect in their apoptosis. As bridging cells of the innate and adaptive immune system; the percentage of NK cells was in normal range whereas the percentages of CD3-CD8+CD56+ innate lymphoid and CD3+CD56+ NK like T cells were found to be high in the severe cases of COVID-19. Although absolute numbers of all lymphocyte subsets were low and showed a tendency for a gradual decrease in accord with the disease progression, in all COVID-19 patients, the lymphocyte subset with the most decreased absolute number was B lymphocytes, followed by CD4 + T cells in the severe cases. The percentages of suppressive, CD3+CD4-CD8-; HLA-DR+CD3+ and CD28-CD8+ cells were found to be significantly increased. Importantly, we demonstrated spontaneous caspase-3 activation and increased lymphocyte apoptosis. Altogether our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects lymphocytes not innate cells. So that, it may interrupt the cross-talk between adaptive and innate immune systems.","Eksioglu-Demiralp, E.; Alan, S.; Sili, U.; Bakan, D.; Ocak, I.; Yurekli, R.; Alpay, N.; Gorcin, S.; Yildiz, A.",2020-08-04,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.01.20166587,1,Emel Eksioglu-Demiralp,"Istanbul Memorial Sisli Hospital, Tissue Typing and Immunology Laboratory",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.01.20166587v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.01.20166587v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
16139,Pooled Saliva Specimens for SARS-CoV-2 Testing,"We evaluated saliva (SAL) specimens for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing by comparison of 459 prospectively paired nasopharyngeal (NP) or mid-turbinate (MT) swabs from 449 individuals with the aim of using saliva for asymptomatic screening. Samples were collected in a drive-through car line for symptomatic individuals (N=380) and in the emergency department (ED) (N=69). The percent positive and negative agreement of saliva compared to nasopharyngeal swab were 81.1% (95% CI: 65.8% - 90.5%) and 99.8% (95% CI: 98.7% - 100%), respectively. The sensitivity increased to 90.0% (95% CI: 74.4% - 96.5%) when considering only samples with moderate to high viral load (Cycle threshold (Ct) for the NP <=34). Pools of five saliva specimens were also evaluated on three platforms: bioMerieux NucliSENS easyMAG with ABI 7500Fast (CDC assay), Hologic Panther Fusion, and Roche COBAS 6800. The median loss of signal upon pooling was 2-4 Ct values across the platforms. The sensitivity of detecting a positive specimen in a pool compared with testing individually was 100%, 93%, and 95% for CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR, Panther Fusion(R) SARS-CoV-2 assay, and cobas(R) SARS-CoV-2 test respectively, with decreased sample detection trending with lower viral load. We conclude that although pooled saliva testing, as collected in this study, is not quite as sensitive as NP/MT testing, saliva testing is adequate to detect individuals with higher viral loads in an asymptomatic screening program, does not require swabs or viral transport media for collection, and may help to improve voluntary screening compliance for those individuals averse to various forms of nasal collections.","Barat, B.; Das, S.; Giorgi, V.

4015,Variation in human mobility and its impact on the risk of future COVID-19 outbreaks in Taiwan,"BackgroundAs COVID-19 continues to spread around the world, understanding how patterns of human mobility and connectivity affect outbreak dynamics, especially before outbreaks establish locally, is critical for informing response efforts. In Taiwan, most cases to date were imported or linked to imported cases.

MethodsIn collaboration with Facebook Data for Good, we characterized changes in movement patterns in Taiwan since February 2020, and built metapopulation models that incorporate human movement data to identify the high risk areas of disease spread and assess the potential effects of local travel restrictions in Taiwan.

ResultsWe found that mobility changed with the number of local cases in Taiwan in the past few months. For each city, we identified the most highly connected areas that may serve as sources of importation during an outbreak. We showed that the risk of an outbreak in Taiwan is enhanced if initial infections occur around holidays. Intracity travel reductions have a higher impact on the risk of an outbreak than intercity travel reductions, while intercity travel reductions can narrow the scope of the outbreak and help target resources. The timing, duration, and level of travel reduction together determine the impact of travel reductions on the number of infections, and multiple combinations of these can result in similar impact.

ConclusionsTo prepare for the potential spread within Taiwan, we utilized Facebooks aggregated and anonymized movement and colocation data to identify cities with higher risk of infection and regional importation. We developed an interactive application that allows users to vary inputs and assumptions and shows the spatial spread of the disease and the impact of intercity and intracity travel reduction under different initial conditions. Our results can be used readily if local transmission occurs in Taiwan after relaxation of border control, providing important insights into future disease surveillance and policies for travel restrictions.","Chang, M.-C.; Kahn, R.; Li, Y.-A.; Lee, C.-S.; Buckee, C.

9719,COVID-19 Deaths: Which Explanatory Variables Matter the Most?,"SO_SCPLOWUMMARYC_SCPLOWAs Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads around the World, many questions about the disease are being answered; however, many more remain poorly understood. Although the situation is rapidly evolving, with datasets being continually corrected or updated, it is crucial to understand what factors may be driving transmission through different populations. While studies are beginning to highlight specific parameters that may be playing a role, few have attempted to thoroughly estimate the relative importance of these disparate variables that likely include: climate, population demographics, and imposed state interventions. In this report, we compiled a database of more than 28 potentially explanatory variables for each of the 50 U.S. states through early May 2020. Using a combination of traditional statistical and modern machine learning approaches, we identified those variables that were the most statistically significant, and, those that were the most important. These variables were chosen to be fiduciaries of a range of possible drivers for COVID-19 deaths in the USA. We found that population-weighted density (PWD), some """"stay at home"""" metrics, monthly temperature and precipitation, race/ethnicity, and chronic low-respiratory death rate, were all statistically significant. Of these, PWD and mobility metrics dominated. This suggests that the biggest impact on COVID-19 deaths was, at least initially, a function of where you lived, and not what you did. However, clearly, increasing social distancing has the net effect of (at least temporarily) reducing the effective PWD. Our results strongly support the idea that the loosening of """"lock-down"""" orders should be tailored to the local PWD. In contrast to these variables, while still statistically significant, race/ethnicity, health, and climate effects could only account for a few percent of the variability in deaths. Where associations were anticipated but were not found, we discuss how limitations in the parameters chosen may mask a contribution that might otherwise be present.","Riley, P.; Riley, A.; Turtle, J.; Ben-Nun, M.",2020-06-14,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.11.20129007,1,Pete Riley,Predictive Science Inc.,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.11.20129007v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.11.20129007v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
16043,"Quantifying the dynamics of COVID-19 burden and impact of interventions in Java, Indonesia","BackgroundAs in many countries, quantifying COVID-19 spread in Indonesia remains challenging due to testing limitations. In Java, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented throughout 2020. However, as a vaccination campaign launches, cases and deaths are rising across the island.

MethodsWe used modelling to explore the extent to which data on burials in Jakarta using strict COVID-19 protocols (C19P) provide additional insight into the transmissibility of the disease, epidemic trajectory, and the impact of NPIs. We assess how implementation of NPIs in early 2021 will shape the epidemic during the period of likely vaccine roll-out.

ResultsC19P burial data in Jakarta suggest a death toll approximately 3.3 times higher than reported. Transmission estimates using these data suggest earlier, larger, and more sustained impact of NPIs. Measures to reduce sub-national spread, particularly during Ramadan, substantially mitigated spread to more vulnerable rural areas. Given current trajectory, daily cases and deaths are likely to increase in most regions as the vaccine is rolled-out. Transmission may peak in early 2021 in Jakarta if current levels of control are maintained. However, relaxation of control measures is likely to lead to a subsequent resurgence in the absence of an effective vaccination campaign.

ConclusionSyndromic measures of mortality provide a more complete picture of COVID-19 severity upon which to base decision-making. The high potential impact of the vaccine in Java is attributable to reductions in transmission to date and dependent on these being maintained. Increases in control in the relatively short-term will likely yield large, synergistic increases in vaccine impact.

C_LIO_LINPIs implemented in Java earlier in the pandemic have substantially slowed the course of the epidemic with movement restrictions during Ramadan preventing spread to more vulnerable rural populations.
C_LIO_LIPopulation-level immunity remains below proposed herd-immunity thresholds for the virus, though it is likely substantially higher in Jakarta.
C_LI

What do the new findings imply?O_LIGiven current levels of control, upwards trends in deaths are likely to continue in many provinces while the vaccine is scheduled to be rolled out. A key exception is Jakarta where population-level immunity may increase to a level where the epidemic begins to decline before the vaccine campaign has reached high coverage.
C_LIO_LIFurther relaxation of measures would lead to more rapidly progressing epidemics, depleting the eventual incremental effectiveness of the vaccine. Maintaining adherence to control measures in Jakarta may be particularly challenging if the epidemic enters a decline phase but will remain necessary to prevent a subsequent large wave. Elsewhere, higher levels of control with NPIs are likely to yield high synergistic vaccine impact.

25540,Estimating the false positive rate of highly automated SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification testing,"Molecular testing for infectious diseases is generally both very sensitive and specific. Well-designed PCR primers rarely cross-react with other analytes, and specificities seen during test validation are often 100%. However, analytical specificities measured during validation may not reflect real-world performance across the entire testing process. Here, we use the unique environment of SARS-CoV-2 screening among otherwise well individuals to examine the false positivity rate of high throughput so-called """"sample-to-answer"""" nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) on three commercial assays: the Hologic Panther Fusion(R), Hologic Aptima(R) transcription mediated amplification (TMA), and Roche cobas(R) 6800. We used repetitive sampling of the same person as the gold standard to determine test specificity rather than retesting of the same sample. We examined 451 people repetitively sampled over 7 months via nasal swab, comprising 7,242 results. During the study period there were twelve positive tests (0.17%) from 9 people. Eight positive tests (0.11%, five individuals) were considered bona fide true positives based on repeat positives or outside testing and epidemiological data. One positive test had no follow-up testing or metadata and could not be adjudicated. Three positive tests (three individuals) did not repeat as positive on a subsequent collection, nor did the original positive specimen test positive on an orthogonal platform. We consider these three tests false positives and estimate the overall false positive rate of high-throughput automated, sample-to-answer NAAT testing to be approximately 0.041% (3/7242). These data help laboratorians, epidemiologists, and regulators understand specificity and positive predictive value associated with high-throughput NAAT testing.","Chandler, C.

5343,"Relative disease burdens of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza in New York City, February 1 - April 18, 2020.","Comparisons between the mortality burdens of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza often fail to account for the fact that the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports annual influenza mortality estimates which are calculated based upon a series of assumptions about the underreporting of flu deaths. COVID-19 deaths, in contrast, are being reported as raw counts. In this report, we compare COVID-19 death counts to seasonal influenza death counts in New York City during the interval from February 1 - April 18, 2020. Using this approach, COVID-19 appears to have caused 21.4 times the number of deaths as seasonal influenza during the same period. We also assessed excess mortality in order to verify this finding. New York City has had approximately 13,032 excess all-cause mortality deaths during this time period. We assume that most of these deaths are COVID-19 related. We therefore calculated the ratio of excess deaths (i.e. assumed COVID-19 deaths) to seasonal influenza deaths during the same time interval and found a similar ratio of 21.1 COVID-19 to seasonal influenza deaths. Our findings are consistent with conditions on the ground today. Comparing COVID-19 deaths with CDC estimates of yearly influenza-related deaths would suggest that, this year, seasonal influenza has killed approximately the same number of Americans as COVID-19 has. This does not comport with the realities of the pandemic we see today.","Faust, J.; Del Rio, C.",2020-04-27,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.22.20073551,1,Jeremy Faust,"Brigham and Women\'s Hospital, Harvard Medical School",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20073551v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20073551v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
8938,SARS-CoV-2 genomic and subgenomic RNAs in diagnostic samples are not an indicator of active replication,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China in late December 2019 and has spread worldwide. Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive sense, single-stranded RNA viruses and employ a complicated pattern of virus genome length RNA replication as well as transcription of genome length and leader containing subgenomic RNAs. Although not fully understood, both replication and transcription are thought to take place in so-called double-membrane vesicles in the cytoplasm of infected cells. We here describe detection of SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNAs in diagnostic samples up to 17 days after initial detection of infection, provide evidence for their nuclease resistance and likely protection by cellular membranes consistent with being part of virus-induced replication organelles. Furthermore, we show that the ratios of genomic to subgenomic RNA as well as the ratios of plus to negative strand RNA of genomic and subgenomic RNA are consistent with what have been detected for other coronaviruses in cell culture; albeit with the caveat that in vivo diagnostic samples, even in relatively early infection, the ratios of these RNAs are most reminiscent of late culture, semi-purified virus preparations shown to have a relatively constant ratio of genomic to subgenomic RNAs of around 5-10 or higher, while the ratios of positive to negative strands are more than 100 for the genomic RNA and around 20 for the subgenomic RNAs. Overall, our results may help explain the extended PCR positivity of some samples, and may also, at least in part, help explain discrepancies in results of different diagnostic PCR methods described by others; in particular for samples with a low virus load or of poor quality. Overall, we present evidence that subgenomic RNAs may not be an indicator of active coronavirus replication/infection, but that these RNAs, similar to the virus genome RNA, may be rather stable, and thus detectable for an extended period, most likely due to their close association with cellular membranes.","Alexandersen, S.; Chamings, A.; Bhatta, T.

12081,Reducing COVID-19 hospitalization risk through behavior change,"Our objective was to determine strategies that could potentially reduce the risk of hospitalizations from COVID-19 due to underlying conditions. We used data (N=444,649) from the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to identify potentially modifiable risk factors associated with reporting any of the underlying conditions (cardiovascular disease, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension or obesity) found to increase risk of US hospitalizations for COVID-19. Risk factors included lifetime smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption. Multiple logistic regression in Stata produced adjusted odds ratios (AORs) used to estimate population attributable-risk (PAR) in Excel. PARs for the 3 risk factors ranged from 12.4% for inactivity to 15.6% for diet for a combined PAR of 36.3%, implying that total elimination of these 3 risk factors could potentially reduce underlying conditions as much as 36%. This suggests that reducing COVID-19 hospitalizations might be a measurable and feasible US goal for the coronavirus pandemic. The simple lifestyle changes of increasing physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption could reduce obesity, a key underlying condition and risk factor for 4 others. Reducing obesity and inactivity may also boost immunity. With uncertainly around how long the pandemic might last, other proposed strategies include wearing face masks when social distancing is not feasible, and addressing the special issues for nursing home residents. Such actions have the potential to lessen the impact of COVID-19 in the short term along with providing long term health benefits regarding chronic conditions.","Adams, M. L.; Katz, D.

16950,Saliva as testing sample for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR in low prevalence community setting.,"ObjectivesThe number of COVID-19 cases is increasing globally and there is an urgency for a simple non-invasive method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Our study aimed to demonstrate that saliva can be used as a specimen for SARS-CoV-2 detection notably for the screening of extensive population groups via pooling.

MethodsTo demonstrate that saliva is an appropriate specimen for SARS-CoV-2 detection a field study including 3,660 participants was performed between September 29 and October 1, 2020. We collected paired nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva specimens and processed them within 24 hours of collection. We performed 36 serial measurements of 8 SARS-CoV-2 positive saliva samples to confirm the stability of the specimen and completed 37 pools of saliva samples by adding one positive specimen per pool.

ResultsSaliva specimens were stable for testing for up to 24 hours. Overall, 44 salival samples (1.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the field study. The results of saliva samples were consistent with those obtained from NPS from the same patient with 90% sensitivity (95% CI 68.3%-98.7%) and 100% specificity during the first two weeks after the onset of symptoms. Using pooling strategy 796 RT-PCR tests were performed. All pools showed 100% positivity in different pooling proportions.

ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate that saliva is an appropriate specimen for pooling and SARS-CoV-2 screening with accurate diagnostic performance. Patient-performed simple specimen collection allows testing an extensive number of people rapidly, obtaining results of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and allowing authorities to take timely measures.","Gavars, D.; Gavars, M.; Perminovs, D.; Stasulans, J.; Stana, J.; Metla, Z.; Pavare, J.; Tauckels, E.; Gulbis, E.; Dumpis, U.",2020-11-30,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.20.20216127,2,Didzis Gavars,E.

5872,Response strategies for COVID-19 epidemics in African settings: a mathematical modelling study,"BackgroundThe health impact of COVID-19 may differ in African settings as compared to countries in Europe or China due to demographic, epidemiological, environmental and socio-economic factors. We evaluated strategies to reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden in African countries, so as to support decisions that balance minimising mortality, protecting health services and safeguarding livelihoods.

MethodsWe used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered mathematical model, stratified by age, to predict the evolution of COVID-19 epidemics in three countries representing a range of age distributions in Africa (from oldest to youngest average age: Mauritius, Nigeria and Niger), under various effectiveness assumptions for combinations of different non-pharmaceutical interventions: self-isolation of symptomatic people, physical distancing, and  shielding (physical isolation) of the high-risk population. We adapted model parameters to better represent uncertainty about what might be expected in African populations, in particular by shifting the distribution of severity risk towards younger ages and increasing the case-fatality ratio.

ResultsWe predicted median clinical attack rates over the first 12 months of 17% (Niger) to 39% (Mauritius), peaking at 2-4 months, if epidemics were unmitigated. Self-isolation while symptomatic had a maximum impact of about 30% on reducing severe cases, while the impact of physical distancing varied widely depending on percent contact reduction and R0. The effect of shielding high-risk people, e.g. by rehousing them in physical isolation, was sensitive mainly to residual contact with low-risk people, and to a lesser extent to contact among shielded individuals. Response strategies incorporating self-isolation of symptomatic individuals, moderate physical distancing and high uptake of shielding reduced predicted peak bed demand by 46% to 54% and mortality by 60% to 75%. Lockdowns delayed epidemics by about 3 months. Estimates were sensitive to differences in age-specific social mixing patterns, as published in the literature.

DiscussionIn African settings, as elsewhere, current evidence suggests large COVID-19 epidemics are expected. However, African countries have fewer means to suppress transmission and manage cases. We found that self-isolation of symptomatic persons and general physical distancing are unlikely to avert very large epidemics, unless distancing takes the form of stringent lockdown measures. However, both interventions help to mitigate the epidemic. Shielding of high-risk individuals can reduce health service demand and, even more markedly, mortality if it features high uptake and low contact of shielded and unshielded people, with no increase in contact among shielded people. Strategies combining self-isolation, moderate physical distancing and shielding will probably achieve substantial reductions in mortality in African countries. Temporary lockdowns, where socioeconomically acceptable, can help gain crucial time for planning and expanding health service capacity.","Van Zandvoort, K.; Jarvis, C. I.; Pearson, C.; Davies, N.

1704,The effect of travel restrictions on the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak,"Motivated by the rapid spread of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Mainland China, we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of both domestic and international travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic. The model is calibrated on the evidence of internationally imported cases before the implementation of the travel quarantine of Wuhan. By assuming a generation time of 7.5 days, the reproduction number is estimated to be 2.4 [90% CI 2.2-2.6]. The median estimate for number of cases before the travel ban implementation on January 23, 2020 is 58,956 [90% CI 40,759 - 87,471] in Wuhan and 3,491 [90% CI 1,924 - 7,360] in other locations in Mainland China. The model shows that as of January 23, most Chinese cities had already received a considerable number of infected cases, and the travel quarantine delays the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days. The travel quarantine has a more marked effect at the international scale, where we estimate the number of case importations to be reduced by 80% until the end of February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.","Chinazzi, M.; Davis, J.

16284,System Dynamics Model of Possible Covid-19 Trajectories Under Various Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention Options in Low Resource Setting.,"We present a population-based System Dynamics Model (SDM) of possible Covid-19 trajectories under various intervention options in the uniqueness of Kenya. We developed a stock and flow based SDM. We parametrized the SDM using published data and where data was not available, expert opinion was sought. Following validation test, the model was simulated to determined possible outcomes of non-pharmaceutical interventions in management of Covid-19. We simulate the possible impact of; social distancing, quarantining, curfew and cross-county travel restriction, lockdown of selected cities in Kenya and quarantining. We varied interventions in terms of start dates, duration of implementation and effectiveness of the interventions. We estimated the outcomes in terms of number of possible infections, recoveries and deaths. With the current state of interventions, we estimated a peak of Covid-19 in September 2020 with an estimated 13.5 Million Covid-19 cases and 33.8 thousand deaths in Kenya. The largest possible reduction in infections and mortality was achievable through increase in the effectiveness of the interventions. The suggested interventions would delay the epidemic peak of Covid-19 to between late Nov 2020 and early December 2020 with an estimated13M cases a 500 thousand reduction in Covid-19 cases and 32.4 deaths (a reduction in 1400 deaths). We conclude that SDM enables understanding of the complexity and impact of different interventions scenarios of Covid-19 in Kenya.","Kivuti-Bitok, L. W.; Momodu, A. S.; Jebet, J.

8656,The Effect of Ultraviolet C Radiation Against SARS-CoV-2 Inoculated N95 Respirators,"Since March 31st, 2020, during the height of the pandemic, we have decontaminated thousands of 3M 1860 respirators with Ultraviolet C (UVC) for our frontline workers. There is no published peer-reviewed data regarding the dose required to effectively disinfect SARS-CoV-2 on N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs). Four different locations (facepiece and strap) on 5 different N95 FFR models (3M 1860, 8210, 8511, 9211; Moldex 1511) were inoculated with a 10 L drop of SARS-CoV-2 viral stock (8 x 107 TCID50/mL). The outside-facing and wearer-facing surfaces of the respirators were each irradiated with a dose of 1.5 J/cm2 UVC (254 nm).

Viable SARS-CoV-2 was quantified by a median tissue culture infectious dose assay (TCID50). UVC delivered using a dose of 1.5 J/cm2, to each side, was an effective method of decontamination for the facepieces of 3M 1860 and Moldex 1511, and for the straps of 3M 8210 and the Moldex 1511. This dose is an appropriate decontamination method to facilitate reuse of respirators for healthcare personnel when applied to certain models/materials. Increasing the dose may improve decontamination for the other models and straps; however, UVC radiation can degrade certain polymers in a dose dependent manner, and the effects may vary greatly between different models. Therefore, fit-testing of UVC decontaminated respirators must be performed each time a new model and/or dose is introduced into the healthcare system.","Ozog, D. M.; Sexton, J.

13548,Covid-19 related stress and coping strategies among adults with chronic disease in Southwest Ethiopia.,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus which are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals which can affect people physically and psychologically. The older people and those with underlying medical problems are more likely to develop serious illness and death.

Objectivethe aim of this study was to determine Covid-19 related stress and coping strategies among adults with chronic disease in Bench-Sheko,West Omo and Keffa Zones, southwest Ethiopia

MethodsInstitutional based cross-sectional study was applied among 613 adults with chronic disease. A simple sampling technique was applied. Correlational analysis was used to determine the relationship between the COVID-19 related stress score and coping strategy types. To measure the strength of association between dependent variables and independent variables and Pearson coefficients (r) with 95% Confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Finally, the variable, which shows statistical significance (p-value < 0.05 cut point) were used to quantify the associations among variables.

ResultsAround 613 participants of 96% response rate were participated. About 68.4% were moderately stressed; low stress was 17.8% and severe stress was 13.9 %. Covid-19 related perceived stress score were positively associated with coping strategies types of like sell-distraction, active coping, denial, emotional support, behavioral disengagement, venting, and use of instrument, positive reframing, self-blaming, planning, humoring and religion. The most preferable types of coping strategies were religious, instrumental and active coping strategies and while the least used were substance used.

ConclusionSignificant numbers of participants were suffered from severe perceived stress due to covid-19 outbreak in this study area. Both adaptive and maladaptive Coping strategy types were significantly associated with stress. Substance use and self-blaming were the types coping strategies which were not associated with perceived stress.","Girma, A.; Ayalew, E.",2020-08-15,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.14.20174318,1,Abel Girma,Mizan-Tepi university,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20174318v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20174318v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
23469,Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of respiratory Gram-negative bacterial isolates from COVID-19 patients in Switzerland,"BackgroundBacterial superinfections associated with COVID-19 are common in ventilated ICU patients and impact morbidity and lethality. However, the contribution of antimicrobial resistance to the manifestation of bacterial infections in these patients has yet to be elucidated.

MethodsWe collected 70 Gram-negative bacterial strains, isolated from the lower respiratory tract of ventilated COVID-19 patients in Zurich, Switzerland between March and May 2020. Species identification was performed using MALDI-TOF; antibiotic susceptibility profiles were determined by EUCAST disk diffusion and CLSI broth microdilution assays. Selected Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing.

ResultsP. aeruginosa (46%) and Enterobacterales (36%) comprised the two largest etiologic groups. Drug resistance in P. aeruginosa isolates was high for piperacillin/tazobactam (65.6%), cefepime (56.3%), ceftazidime (46.9%) and meropenem (50.0%). Enterobacterales isolates showed slightly lower levels of resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam (32%), ceftriaxone (32%), and ceftazidime (36%). All P. aeruginosa isolates and 92% of Enterobacterales isolates were susceptible to aminoglycosides, with apramycin found to provide best-in-class coverage. Genotypic analysis of consecutive P. aeruginosa isolates in one patient revealed a frameshift mutation in the transcriptional regulator nalC that coincided with a phenotypic shift in susceptibility to {beta}-lactams and quinolones.

ConclusionsConsiderable levels of antimicrobial resistance may have contributed to the manifestation of bacterial superinfections in ventilated COVID-19 patients, and may in some cases mandate consecutive adaptation of antibiotic therapy. High susceptibility to amikacin and apramycin suggests that aminoglycosides may remain an effective second-line treatment of ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, provided efficacious drug exposure in lungs can be achieved.","Gysin, M.; Acevedo, C.

17034,Tocilizumab in nonventilated patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pneumonia is often associated with hyperinflammation. Safety and efficacy of the anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab was evaluated in patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia.

MethodsNonventilated patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia were randomized (2:1) to tocilizumab (8 mg/kg intravenous) or placebo plus standard care. Sites enrolling high-risk and minority populations were emphasized. The primary endpoint was cumulative proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation or who had died by Day 28.

ResultsOf 389 randomized patients, 249 patients received tocilizumab and 128 received placebo in the modified intent-to-treat population (Hispanic/Latino, 56.0%; Black/African American, 14.9%; American Indian/Alaska Native, 12.7%; White, 12.7%; other/unknown, 3.7%). The cumulative proportion (95% confidence interval [CI]) of patients requiring mechanical ventilation or who had died by Day 28 was 12.0% (8.52% to 16.86%) and 19.3 % (13.34% to 27.36%) for the tocilizumab and placebo arms, respectively (log-rank P=0.0360; hazard ratio, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.97]). Median time to clinical failure up to Day 28 favored tocilizumab over placebo (hazard ratio 0.55 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.93]). All-cause mortality by Day 28 was 10.4% with tocilizumab and 8.6% with placebo (weighted difference, 2.0% [95% CI, - 5.2% to 7.8%). In the safety population, serious adverse events occurred in 15.2% of tocilizumab patients (38/250 patients) and 19.7% of placebo patients (25/127).

ConclusionsThis trial demonstrated the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab over placebo in reducing the likelihood of progression to requiring mechanical ventilation or death in nonventilated patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia.

18545,Microbial context predicts SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in patients and the hospital built environment,"Synergistic effects of bacteria on viral stability and transmission are widely documented but remain unclear in the context of SARS-CoV-2. We collected 972 samples from hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), their health care providers, and hospital surfaces before, during, and after admission. We screened for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR, characterized microbial communities using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and contextualized the massive microbial diversity in this dataset through meta-analysis of over 20,000 samples. Sixteen percent of surfaces from COVID-19 patient rooms were positive, with the highest prevalence in floor samples next to patient beds (39%) and directly outside their rooms (29%). Although bed rail samples increasingly resembled the patient microbiome over time, SARS-CoV-2 was detected less there (11%). Despite viral surface contamination in almost all patient rooms, no health care workers contracted the disease, suggesting that personal protective equipment was effective in preventing transmissions. SARS-CoV-2 positive samples had higher bacterial phylogenetic diversity across human and surface samples, and higher biomass in floor samples. 16S microbial community profiles allowed for high SARS-CoV-2 classifier accuracy in not only nares, but also forehead, stool, and floor samples. Across distinct microbial profiles, a single amplicon sequence variant from the genus Rothia was highly predictive of SARS-CoV-2 across sample types and had higher prevalence in positive surface and human samples, even compared to samples from patients in another intensive care unit prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. These results suggest that bacterial communities may contribute to viral prevalence both in the host and hospital environment.

25380,"Emotional symptoms, mental fatigue and behavioral adherence after 72 continuous days of strict lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina","BackgroundAn early, total, and prolonged lockdown was adopted in Argentina during the first wave of COVID-19 as the main sanitary strategy to reduce the spread of the virus in the population. The aim of this study was to explore emotional symptoms, mental fatigue, and behavioral adherence associated with the COVID-19 pandemic after an average of 72 days of continuous lockdown in Argentina. Specifically, we intended to know: 1) if the prolongation of the lockdown was associated with elevated emotional symptoms; 2) if the prolonged lockdown affected adherence, a phenomenon called """"behavioral fatigue""""; and 3) how financial concerns in a developing country affected adherence to the lockdown and emotional status of the population.

MethodA survey was designed to evaluate the psychological impact of the pandemic and lockdown. The survey included standardized questionnaires to assess the severity of depressive (PHQ-9) and anxious (GAD-7) symptoms, a questionnaire to evaluate mental fatigue, and several additional instruments to assess other variables of interest: risk perception, lockdown adherence, financial concerns, daily stress, loneliness, intolerance to uncertainty, negative repetitive thinking, and cognitive problems. Three LASSO regression analyses were carried to evaluate the predictive role of the different variables over depression, anxiety, and lockdown adherence

ResultsThe survey was responded by 3617 individuals over the age of 18 (85.2% female) from all the provinces of Argentina. Using the Oxford stringency index, Argentina had one of the most stringent and prolonged lockdowns when the sample was collected with 63 to 77 continuous days with a stringency index of more than 85/100. 45.6% of the sample met the cut-off for depression and 27% for anxiety. Previous mental health treatment, low income, being younger, and being female were associated with higher levels of emotional symptoms. Mental fatigue, cognitive failures, and financial concerns were also associated with emotional and subjective complaints, but not with adherence to the lockdown. In the regression models, mental fatigue, cognitive failures, and loneliness were the most important variables to predict depression, meanwhile intolerance to uncertainty and lockdown difficulty were the most important in the case of anxiety. Perceived threat was the most important variable predicting lockdown adherence.

ConclusionsEmotional symptoms persisted and even increased during the extended lockdown, but we found no evidence of behavioral fatigue. Instead, mental fatigue, cognitive difficulties, and financial concerns were expressions of the emotional side of the pandemic and the restrictive measures.","Torrente, F.; Yoris, A. E.; Low, D.

5259,Knowledge and Beliefs of General Public of India on COVID-19: A Web-based Cross-sectional Survey,"ContextDespite many awareness programs conducted by the governments and other agencies, there are certain false beliefs among the general public of India towards the transmission, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19.

AimsTo assess the knowledge and beliefs of the general public of India on COVID-19.

Materials and MethodsA web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between 20th March and 15th April 2020. A 17-item questionnaire was developed, validated, and used for the study. The questionnaire was randomly distributed among the public using Google forms through social media networks. Descriptive analysis was performed to represent the study characteristics, Chi-square test for assessing the associations among the study variables, and logistic regression analysis for identifying the factors influencing the beliefs.

ResultsA total of 462 participants with a mean (SD) age of 30.66 (11.31) years were responded to the questionnaire. Study participants are having fairly good knowledge of the basic aspects of COVID-19. However, a considerable fraction of participants were having false beliefs towards the transmission of new coronavirus, and prevention & treatment of COVID-19. It was observed that the participants who were aged 31-60 years and >60 years, education level of intermediate or diploma and high school certificate, and occupation as the unskilled workers had more of false beliefs towards COVID-19 compared to their counterparts.

ConclusionThough the overall knowledge on COVID-19 was good enough among the general public of India, still there is a need for education to avoid false beliefs especially among the people who are elderly, having a low level of education, and non-professional workers.

9583,"Associations between mask-wearing, handwashing, and social distancing practices and risk of COVID-19 infection in public: a case-control study in Thailand","We evaluated the effectiveness of personal protective measures, including mask-wearing, handwashing, and social distancing, against COVID-19 infection among contacts of cases. We conducted a case-control study with 211 cases and 839 non-matched controls using all contact tracing records of Thailands national Surveillance and Rapid Response Team. Cases were asymptomatic contacts of COVID-19 patients identified between 1 and 31 March 2020 who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by 21 April 2020; controls were asymptomatic contacts who were not diagnosed with COVID-19. Participants were queried about practices during contact periods with a case. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for associations between diagnosis of COVID-19 and covariates using multivariable logistic regression models. Wearing masks all the time during contact was independently associated with lower risk of COVID-19 infection compared to not wearing masks (aOR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09- 0.60), while sometimes wearing masks during contact was not (aOR 0.87, 95% CI 0.41-1.84).

9889,A Digital Protein Microarray for COVID-19 Cytokine Storm Monitoring,"Despite widespread concern for cytokine storms leading to severe morbidity in COVID-19, rapid cytokine assays are not routinely available for monitoring critically ill patients. We report the clinical application of a machine learning-based digital protein microarray platform for rapid multiplex quantification of cytokines from critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the University of Michigan Hospital. The platform comprises two low-cost modules: (i) a semi-automated fluidic dispensing/mixing module that can be operated inside a biosafety cabinet to minimize the exposure of technician to the virus infection and (ii) a 12-12-15 inch compact fluorescence optical scanner for the potential near-bedside readout. The platform enabled daily cytokine analysis in clinical practice with high sensitivity (<0.4pg/mL), inter-assay repeatability ([~]10% CV), and near-real-time operation with a 10min assay incubation. A cytokine profiling test with the platform allowed us to observe clear interleukin -6 (IL-6) elevations after receiving tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor) while significant cytokine profile variability exists across all critically ill COVID-19 patients and to discover a weak correlation between IL-6 to clinical biomarkers, such as Ferritin and CRP. Our data revealed large subject-to-subject variability in a patients response to anti-inflammatory treatment for COVID-19, reaffirming the need for a personalized strategy guided by rapid cytokine assays.","Song, Y.; Ye, Y.; Su, S.-H.; Stephens, A.; Cai, T.; Chung, M.-T.; Han, M.; Newstead, M.

Although countries show differences in economic development, but similarities such as continental dimension or social interaction, the spread of COVID-19 in them has some similarities. At the moment, the countries are living the disease with temporal delay.

14808,"Passive, open access data measures movement and predicts COVID-19 cases","Following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, early outbreak response relied on behavioral interventions. In the United States, local governments implemented restrictions aimed at reducing movements and contacts to limit viral transmission. In Pennsylvania, restrictions closed schools and businesses in the spring of 2020 and interventions eased later through the summer. In a rural Pennsylvania county, we use passive monitoring of vehicular traffic volume and mobile device derived visits to points of interest as proxies for movements and contacts. Rural areas have limited health care resources, which magnifies the importance of disease prevention. These data show the lowest levels of movement occurred during the strictest phase of restrictions, indicating high levels of compliance with behavioral intervention. We find that increases in movement correlated with increases in SARS-CoV-2 cases 9-18 days later. The methodology used in this study can be adapted to inform outbreak management strategies for other locations and future outbreaks that use behavioral interventions to reduce pathogen transmission.","Faust, C.

25490,Predicting the end of Covid-19 infection for various countries using a stochastic agent-based model taking into account vaccination rates and the new mutant,"Using a stochastic, agent-based model, the course of infection since the first occurrence of a Covid-19 infection is simulated for various countries, taking into account the new, more infectious mutant and the vaccinations. The simulation shows that the course of infection for the United Kingdom (UK) and Israel is surprisingly good. For the other countries, an end date for the infection can be predicted based on the course of the simulation. For Germany, the course is calculated in a second scenario, assuming a higher vaccination rate.","Eissler, M. K.

17399,Anakinra To Prevent Respiratory Failure In COVID-19,"IntroductionThe management of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 should rely on early recognition of the risk for progression to severe respiratory failure (SRF) and its prevention. We investigated if early suPAR (soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor)-guided anakinra treatment could prevent COVID-19-assocated SRF.

MethodsIn this open-label prospective trial, 130 patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia SARS-CoV-2 and suPAR levels [&ge;]6 g/l were assigned to subcutaneous anakinra 100mg once daily for 10 days. The primary outcome was the incidence of SRF at day 14. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, changes in sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, of cytokine-stimulation pattern and of circulating inflammatory mediators. Equal number of propensity score-matched comparators for comorbidities, severity on admission and standard-of care (SOC) were studied.

ResultsThe incidence of SRF was 22.3% (95% CI, 16.0-30.2%) among anakinra-treated patients and 59.2% (95% CI, 50.6-67.3%; P: 4.6 x 10-8) among SOC comparators (hazard ratio, 0.30; 95%CI, 0.20-0.46). 30-day mortality was 11.5% (95% CI, 7.1-18.2%) and 22.3% (95% CI, 16.0-30.2%) respectively (hazard ratio 0.49; 95% CI 0.25-0.97%; P: 0.041). Anakinra treatment was associated with decrease in SOFA score and in circulating interleukin (IL)-6, sCD163 and sIL2-R; the serum IL-10/IL-6 ratio on day 7 was inversely associated with the change in SOFA score. Duration of stay at the intensive care unit and at hospital was shortened compared to the SOC group; the cost of hospitalization was decreased.

ConclusionsEarly suPAR-guided anakinra treatment is associated with decrease of the risk for SRF and restoration of the pro- /anti-inflammatory balance.

15731,"CHARACTERISTICS, MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES OF CRITICALLY ILL COVID-19 PATIENTS ADMITTED TO ICU IN HOSPITALS IN BANGLADESH: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY","ObjectivesThis study aimed to analyse the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of critical COVID-19 cases and investigate risk factors including comorbidities and age in relation with the clinical aftermath of COVID-19 in critical cases in Bangladesh.

MethodsIn this retrospective study, epidemiological and clinical characteristics, complications, laboratory results, and clinical management of the patients were studied from data obtained from 168 individuals diagnosed with an advanced prognosis of COVID-19 admitted in two hospitals in Bangladesh.

ResultsIndividuals in the study sample contracted COVID-19 through community transmission. 56.5% (n = 95) cases died in intensive care units (ICU) during the study period. The median age was 56 years and 79.2% (n=134) were male. Typical clinical manifestation included Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related complications (79.2%), fever (54.2%) and cough (25.6%) while diabetes mellitus (52.4%), hypertension (41.1%) and heart diseases (16.7%) were the conventional comorbidities. Clinical outcomes were detrimental due to comorbidities rather than age and comorbid individuals over 50 were at more risk. In the sample, oxygen saturation was low (< 95% SpO2) in 135 patients (80.4%) and 158 (93.4%) patients received supplemental oxygen. Identical biochemical parameters were found in both deceased and surviving cases. Administration of antiviral drug Remdesivir and the glucocorticoid, Dexamethasone increased the proportion of surviving patients slightly.

ConclusionsSusceptibility to developing critical illness due to COVID-19 was found more in comorbid males.

21233,"Distinct Autoimmune Antibody Signatures Between Hospitalized Acute COVID-19 Patients, SARS-CoV-2 Convalescent Individuals, and Unexposed Pre-Pandemic Controls","Increasing evidence suggests that autoimmunity may play a role in the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection during both the acute and  long COVID phases of disease. However, an assessment of autoimmune antibodies in convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients has not yet been reported.

MethodologyWe compared the levels of 18 different IgG autoantibodies (AABs) between four groups: (1) unexposed pre-pandemic subjects from the general population (n = 29); (2) individuals hospitalized with acute moderate-severe COVID-19 (n = 20); (3) convalescent SARS-COV-2-infected subjects with asymptomatic to mild viral symptoms during the acute phase with samples obtained between 1.8 and 7.3 months after infection (n = 9); and (4) unexposed pre-pandemic subjects with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) (n = 6). Total IgG and IgA levels were also measured from subjects in groups 1-3 to assess non-specific pan-B cell activation.

ResultsAs expected, in multivariate analysis, AABs were detected at much higher odds in SLE subjects (5 of 6, 83%) compared to non-SLE pre-pandemic controls (11 of 29, 38%) [odds ratio (OR) 19.4,95% CI, 2.0 - 557.0, p = 0.03]. AAB detection (percentage of subjects with one or more autoantibodies) was higher in SARS-CoV-2 infected convalescent subjects (7 of 9, 78%) [OR 17.4, 95% CI, 2.0 - 287.4, p = 0.02] and subjects with acute COVID-19 (12 of 20, 60%) compared with non-SLE pre-pandemic controls, but was not statistically significant among the latter [OR 1.8,95% CI, 0.6 - 8.1, p = 0.23]. Within the convalescent subject group, AABs were detected in 5/5 with reported persistent symptoms and 2/4 without continued symptoms (p = 0.17). The multivariate computational algorithm Partial Least Squares Determinant Analysis (PLSDA) was used to determine if distinct AAB signatures distinguish subject groups 1-3. Of the 18 autoantibodies measured, anti-Beta 2-Glycoprotein, anti-Proteinase 3-ANCA, anti-Mi-2 and anti-PM/Scl-100 defined the convalescent group; anti-Proteinase 3-ANCA, anti-Mi-2, anti-Jo-1 and anti-RNP/SM defined acute COVID-19 subjects; and anti-Proteinase 3-ANCA, anti-Mi-2, anti-Jo-1, anti-Beta 2-Glycoprotein distinguished unexposed controls. The AABs defining SARS-COV-2 infected from pre-pandemic subjects are widely associated with myopathies, vasculitis, and antiphospholipid syndromes, conditions with some similarities to COVID-19. Compared to pre-pandemic non-SLE controls, subjects with acute COVID-19 had higher total IgG concentration (p-value=0.006) but convalescent subjects did not (p-value=0.08); no differences in total IgA levels were found between groups.

ConclusionsOur findings support existing studies suggesting induction of immune responses to self-epitopes during acute, severe COVID-19 with evidence of general B cell hyperactivation. Also, the preponderance of AAB positivity among convalescent individuals up to seven months after infection indicates potential initiation or proliferation, and then persistence of self-reactive immunity without severe initial disease. These results underscore the importance of further investigation of autoimmunity during SARS-CoV-2 infection and its role in the onset and persistence of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19.","Bhadelia, N.; Belkina, A.; Olson, A.; Winter, T.; Urick, P.; Lin, N.; Rifkin, I.; Kataria, Y.; Yuen, R.; Sagar, M.; Cappione, J.",2021-01-25,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.01.21.21249176,1,Nahid Bhadelia,"Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine and National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL), Boston University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.21.21249176v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.21.21249176v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
22502,Chyawanprash for the prevention of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) occurs after exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). For persons who are at high risk of exposure, the standard of care is personal protection from getting infected. Whether Ayurvedic rasayana drug like Chyawanprash can prevent symptomatic infection in frontline health care workers is unknown.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the effect of the combination of Chyawanprash and Standard Preventive Regimen compared to the use of Standard Preventive Regimen alone on the proportion of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infections among frontline healthcare workers (HCWs).

MethodsAn open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted in the HCWs between 25 to 60 years age currently working in an environment with chance of direct exposure to COVID-19 cases. The interventions to be compared in this trial were Standard Preventive Regimen as per institutional guidelines and based on their roles (Group I) and Ayurvedic Intervention viz., Chyawanprash 12 g twice for 30 days from day of randomization plus Standard Preventive Regimen (Group II). The incidence of RT PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases in both groups, was the primary outcome measure. Evaluation of the safety of the study drug (by any statistically significant change in various biochemical and hematological parameters and occurrence of any adverse drug reactions); incidence of any other infective diseases (bacterial /viral/ fungal / etc.) like upper respiratory tract illness during the study period and any change in the immunoglobulins like IgG, IgM and IgE and inflammatory markers like TNF alpha, IL-6 and IL-10 were the secondary outcome measures.

ResultsOut of 193 participants who completed the study, no participant in both groups was COVID-19 positive at the end of one month. In post intervention follow-up, 4 subjects in Group I and 2 subjects in Group II were COVID-19 positive. No adverse drug reaction or any serious adverse event was reported during the study. No clinically significant change in the safety parameters was observed before and after the study. Statistically significant rise in Serum IgG level was seen in Group II but other inflammatory and immune markers did not show statistically significant difference.

ConclusionChyawanprash was well tolerated by all the participants in the intervention group but to prove its adaptogenic effect and efficacy as an add-on to the standard care in preventing the occurrence of COVID-19, clinical trial for longer duration with larger sample size is needed.

(a) For fastest deceleration of the pandemic, people with high interaction rate such as grocers and airline cabin crew should be given priority in vaccine access. (b) Individuals who have been vaccinated may be selectively cleared to return to normal activities without significant risk of a resurgence in cases. (c) If an infection as well as a vaccine confers immunity for a duration{tau} 0, then the pandemic can be eliminated by vaccinating people at a sufficiently high rate.

16469,Mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on tuberculosis and HIV services: a cross-sectional survey of 669 health professionals in 64 low and middle-income countries,"ObjectiveThe experiences of frontline healthcare professionals are essential in identifying strategies to mitigate the disruption to healthcare services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study of TB and HIV professionals in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). Between May 12 and August 6 2020, we collected qualitative and quantitative data using an online survey in 11 languages. We used descriptive statistics and thematic analysis to analyse responses.

Findings669 respondents from 64 countries completed the survey. Over 40% stated that it was either impossible or much harder for TB and HIV patients to reach healthcare facilities since COVID-19. The most common barriers reported to affect patients were: fear of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2, transport disruptions and movement restrictions. 37% and 28% of responses about TB and HIV stated that healthcare provider access to facilities was also severely impacted. Strategies to address reduced transport needs and costs - including proactive coordination between the health and transport sector and cards that facilitate lower cost or easier travel - were presented in qualitative responses. Access to non-medical support for patients, such as food supplementation or counselling, was severely disrupted according to 36% and 31% of HIV and TB respondents respectively; qualitative data suggested that the need for such services was exacerbated.

ConclusionPatients and healthcare providers across numerous LMIC faced substantial challenges in accessing healthcare facilities, and non-medical support for patients was particularly impacted. Synthesising recommendations of frontline professionals should be prioritised for informing policymakers and healthcare service delivery organisations.","Khan, M.; Rego, S.; Benitez Rajal, J.; Bond, V.; Fatima, R.

15060,Estimates of outbreak-specific SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological parameters from genomic data,"We estimate the basic reproductive number and case counts for 15 distinct SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, distributed across 10 countries and one cruise ship, based solely on phylodynamic analyses of genomic data. Our results indicate that, prior to significant public health interventions, the reproductive numbers for a majority (10) of these outbreaks are similar, with median posterior estimates ranging between 1.4 and 2.8. These estimates provide a view which is complementary to that provided by those based on traditional line listing data. The genomic-based view is arguably less susceptible to biases resulting from differences in testing protocols, testing intensity, and import of cases into the community of interest. In the analyses reported here, the genomic data primarily provides information regarding which samples belong to a particular outbreak. We observe that once these outbreaks are identified, the sampling dates carry the majority of the information regarding the reproductive number. Finally, we provide genome-based estimates of the cumulative case counts for each outbreak, which allow us to speculate on the amount of unreported infections within the populations housing each outbreak. These results indicate that for the majority (7) of the populations studied, the number of recorded cases is much bigger than the estimated cumulative case counts, suggesting the presence of unsequenced pathogen diversity in these populations.

Significance StatementSince the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in late 2019, researchers around the globe have sought to estimate the rate at which the disease spread through populations prior to public health intervention, as quantified by the parameter R0. This is often estimated based on case count data and may be biased due to the presence of import cases. To overcome this, we estimate R0 by applying Bayesian phylodynamic methods to SARS-CoV-2 genomes which have been made available by laboratories worldwide. We provide R0 and absolute infection count estimates for 15 distinct outbreaks. These estimates contribute to our understanding of the baseline transmission dynamics of the disease, which will be critical in guiding future public health responses to the pandemic.","Vaughan, T.

10715,Data-driven estimation of change points reveals correlation between face mask use and accelerated curtailing of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy,"Italy was the first Western country to be seriously affected by COVID-19, and the first to implement drastic measures, which have successfully curtailed the epidemic. To understand which containment measures altered disease dynamics, we estimate change points in COVID-19 dynamics from official Italian data. We find excellent correlation between nationwide lockdown and the epidemic peak in late March 2020. Surprisingly, we find a change point in mid April, which does not correspond to national measures, but may be explained by regional interventions. Change points in regional COVID-19 dynamics correlate well with local distribution of free face masks and regional orders requiring their mandatory use. Regions with no specific interventions showed no change point during April. We speculate that widespread use of face masks and other protective means has contributed substantially to keeping the number of new Italian COVID-19 cases under control in spite of society turning towards a new normality.","Pedersen, M.

8538,An inflammatory cytokine signature helps predict COVID-19 severity and death,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to more than 100,000 deaths in the United States. Several studies have revealed that the hyper-inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is a major cause of disease severity and death in infected patients. However, predictive biomarkers of pathogenic inflammation to help guide targetable immune pathways are critically lacking. We implemented a rapid multiplex cytokine assay to measure serum IL-6, IL-8, TNF-, and IL-1{beta} in hospitalized COVID-19 patients upon admission to the Mount Sinai Health System in New York. Patients (n = 1484) were followed up to 41 days (median 8 days) and clinical information, laboratory test results and patient outcomes were collected. In 244 patients, cytokine measurements were repeated over time, and effect of drugs could be assessed. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to compare survival by cytokine strata, followed by Cox regression models to evaluate the independent predictive value of baseline cytokines. We found that high serum IL-6, IL-8, and TNF- levels at the time of hospitalization were strong and independent predictors of patient survival. Importantly, when adjusting for disease severity score, common laboratory inflammation markers, hypoxia and other vitals, demographics, and a range of comorbidities, IL-6 and TNF- serum levels remained independent and significant predictors of disease severity and death. We propose that serum IL-6 and TNF- levels should be considered in the management and treatment of COVID-19 patients to stratify prospective clinical trials, guide resource allocation and inform therapeutic options. We also propose that patients with high IL-6 and TNF- levels should be assessed for combinatorial blockade of pathogenic inflammation in this disease.","Del Valle, D.

19537,Conundrum of re-positives COVID-19 cases: A Systematic review of Case reports and Case series,"IntroductionThere have been case reports and case series published for RT PCR positive COVID - 19 cases that became RT PCR negative but subsequently became RT PCR positive after a symptom free interval following a negative RT PCR test. These cases may include re-positive, reactivated and re-infection cases. Hence, the systematic review to summarize and synthesize evidence from all available case series and case reports published was undertaken.

MethodologyThe systematic review of case series and case reports was registered with Prospero with registration number CRD42020210446. PRISMA guidelines were followed for conducting the systematic review. Studies published in English language only were considered for the Systematic Review. Inclusion criteria for studies included case reports and case series which have documented cases of positive RT-PCR after a period of improvement or negative RT PCR. Reviews, opinions and animal studies were excluded. Case reports which described clinical presentation or manifestations of COVID-19 cases were also excluded from the studies. Methodological quality was assessed using modified Murad scale.

ResultsA total of 30 case reports/case series were included in the study, wherein a total of 219 cases were included. In re-positive cases, the age range varied from 10 months to 91 years. The pooled proportion using random effects was 12% with 95% CI from 09% to 15%. Among the re-positives, a total of 57 cases (26%) of the cases had co-morbidities. A total of 51 (23.3%) and 17 (7.8%) re-positive cases had been treated with antivirals and corticosteroids respectively. Among the symptomatic cases, the disease severity was lesser as compared to the initial episode of illness. Only a few studies have confirmed the presence of antibodies after the first episode. The few studies that had done contact tracing of re-positives did not find any positive cases among those in contact with re-positives.

ConclusionThis systematic review presents the review of all the case reports and case series on recurrence of COVID 19 disease. Although limited evidence has been generated due to paucity of such studies and shortcomings in the study designs of case reports and case-series, nonetheless, the evidence generated can still be used in making clinical decisions and framing policy guidelines","Yadav, A.

21539,A Rapid and Low-Cost protocol for the detection of B.1.1.7 lineage of SARS-CoV-2 by using SYBR Green-Based RT-qPCR,"BackgroundThe new SARS-CoV-2 variant VUI (202012/01), identified recently in the United Kingdom (UK), exhibits a higher transmissibility rate compared to other variants, and a reproductive number 0.4 higher. In the UK, scientists were able to identify the increase of this new variant through the rise of false negative results for the spike (S) target using a three-target RT-PCR assay (TaqPath kit).

MethodsTo control and study the current coronavirus pandemic, it is important to develop a rapid and low-cost molecular test to identify the aforementioned variant. In this work, we designed primer sets specific to SARS-CoV-2 variant VUI (202012/01) to be used by SYBR Green-based RT-PCR. These primers were specifically designed to confirm the deletion mutations {Delta}69/{Delta}70 in the spike and the {Delta}106/{Delta}107/{Delta}108 in the NSP6 gene. We studied 20 samples from positive patients, 16 samples displayed an S-negative profile (negative for S target and positive for N and ORF1ab targets) and four samples with S, N and ORF1ab positive profile.

ResultsOur results emphasized that all S-negative samples harbored the mutations {Delta}69/{Delta}70 and {Delta}106/{Delta}107/{Delta}108. This protocol could be used as a second test to confirm the diagnosis in patients who were already positive to COVID-19 but showed false negative results for S-gene.

ConclusionsThis technique may allow to identify patients carrying the VUI (202012/01) variant or a closely related variant, in case of shortage in sequencing.","Abdel-Sater, F.; Younes, M.; Nassar, H.; Nguewa, P.; Hamze, K.",2021-01-29,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.01.27.21250048,1,Kassem Hamze,"Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Cancer Immunology (Covid 19 Unit), FACULTY OF SCIENCE I, Lebanese University, HADATH, Beirut, LB 1003",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.27.21250048v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.27.21250048v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

2354,Role of temperature and humidity in the modulation of the doubling time of COVID-19 cases,"COVID-19 is having a great impact on public health, mortality and economy worldwide, in spite of the efforts to prevent its epidemy. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is different from that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, although also expected to spread differently according to meteorological conditions. Our main goal is to investigate the role of some meteorological variables on the expansion of this outbreak.

In this study, an exponential model relating the number of accumulated confirmed cases and time was considered. The rate of COVID-19 spread, using as criterion the doubling time of the number of confirmed cases, was used as dependent variable in a linear model that took four independent meteorological variables: temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed. Only China cases were considered, to control both cultural aspects and containment policies. Confirmed cases and the 4 meteorological variables were gathered between January 23 and March 1 (39 days) for the 31 provinces of Mainland China. Several periods of time were sampled for each province, obtaining more than one value for the rate of disease progression. Two different periods of time were tested, of 12 and 15 days, along with 3 and 5 different starting points in time, randomly chosen. The median value for each meteorological variable was computed, using the same time period; models with [Formula] were selected. The rate of progression and doubling time were computed and used to fit a linear regression model. Models were evaluated using  = 0.05.

Results indicate that the doubling time correlates positively with temperature and inversely with humidity, suggesting that a decrease in the rate of progression of COVID-19 with the arrival of spring and summer in the north hemisphere. A 20{degrees}C increase is expected to delay the doubling time in 1.8 days. Those variables explain 18% of the variation in disease doubling time; the remaining 82% may be related to containment measures, general health policies, population density, transportation or cultural aspects.","Oliveiros, B.; Caramelo, L.; Ferreira, N.

18468,Biofunctionalized Two-dimensional MoS2 Receptors for Rapid Response Modular Electronic SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A Antigen Sensors,"Multiplex electronic antigen sensors for detection of SARS-Cov-2 spike glycoproteins or hemagglutinin from Influenza A in liquid samples with characteristics resembling extracted saliva were fabricated using scalable processes with potential for economical mass-production. The sensors utilize the sensitivity and surface chemistry of a two-dimensional MoS2 transducer for attachment of antibody fragments in a conformation favorable for antigen binding. Ultra-thin layers (3 nm) of amorphous MoS2 were directly sputtered over the entire sensor chip at room temperature and laser annealed to create an array of semiconducting 2H-MoS2 active sensor regions between metal contacts. The semiconducting region was functionalized with monoclonal antibody Fab (fragment antigen binding) fragments derived from whole antibodies complementary to either SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein or Influenza A hemagglutinin using a papain digestion to cleave the antibodies at the disulfide hinges. The high affinity for the MoS2 transducer surface with some density of sulfur vacancies for the antibody fragment base promoted chemisorption with antigen binding regions oriented for interaction with the sample. The angiostatin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor protein for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, was tethered to a hexa-histidine (his6) tag at its c-terminus both for purification purposes, as well as a motif for binding to MoS2. This modified protein was also investigated as a bio-recognition element. Electrical resistance measurements of sensors functionalized with antibody fragments and exposed to antigen concentrations ranging from 2-20,000 picograms per milliliter revealed selective responses in the presence of complementary antigens with sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A on the order of pg/mL and comparable to gold-standard diagnostics such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis. Lack of antigen sensitivity for the larger ACE2 BRE further demonstrates the utility of the engineered antibody fragment/transducer interface in bringing the target antigen closer to the transducer surface for sensitivity required for early detection viral diagnostics.","Muratore, C.; Muratore, M.

3844,Predict the next moves of COVID-19: reveal the temperate and tropical countries scenario,"The spread of COVID-19 engulfs almost all the countries and territories of the planet, and infections and fatality are increasing rapidly. The first epi-center of its massive spread was in Wuhan, Hubei province, China having a temperate weather, but the spread has got an unprecedented momentum in European temperate countries mainly in Italy and Spain (as of March 30, 2020). However, Malaysia and Singapore and the neighboring tropical countries of China got relatively low spread and fatality that created a research interest on whether there are potential impacts of weather condition on COVID-19 spread. Adopting the SIR (Susceptible Infected Removed) deviated model to predict potential cases and death in the coming days from COVID-19 was done using the secondary and official sources of data. This study shows that COVID-19 spread and fatality tend to be high across the world but compared to tropical countries, it is going to be incredibly high in the temperate countries having lower temperature (7-16{degrees}C) and humidity (80-90%) in last March. However, some literature predicted that this might not to be true, rather irrespective of weather conditions there might be a continuous spread and death. Moreover, a large number of asymptotic COVID-19 carrier in both temperate and tropical countries may re-outbreak in the coming winter. Therefore, a comprehensive global program with the leadership of WHO for testing of entire population of the world is required, which will be very useful for the individual states to take proper political action, social movement and medical services.","Hasan, N.

23618,Impact of Vaccine Prioritization Strategies on Mitigating COVID-19: An Agent-Based Simulation Study using an Urban Region in the United States,"BackgroundApproval of novel vaccines for COVID-19 has brought hope and expectations, but not without additional challenges. One central challenge is how to appropriately prioritize the use of limited supply of vaccines. This study evaluates various prioritization strategies and the efficacy of the vaccination campaign underway in the U.S.

MethodsThe study develops a granular agent-based simulation model for mimicking community spread of COVID-19 under various social interventions including full and partial closures, isolation and quarantine, use of face mask and contact tracing, and vaccination. The model is populated with demographic and societal data for an urban community in the U.S. with 2.8 million residents as well as viral parameters. The model tracks daily numbers of infected, hospitalized, and deaths for all census age-groups. Model is calibrated using parameters for viral transmission and level of community circulation of individuals. Published data from the Florida COVID-19 dashboard is used to validate the model. Vaccination strategies are compared using hypothesis test for pairwise comparisons.

ResultsThree prioritization strategies examined are: a close variant of the CDC recommendation, an age-stratified strategy, and a random strategy. The impact of vaccination is also contrasted with a no vaccination scenario. The comparison shows that the ongoing campaign in the U.S. using vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna is expected to 1) reduce the cumulative number of infection by 10% and 2) help the pandemic to subside below a small threshold of 100 daily new reported cases sooner by approximately a month. The prioritization strategies when compared with each other showed no significant difference in their impacts on pandemic mitigation.

ConclusionsRecent explosive growth of the number of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. continues to shrink the susceptible population. This, we believe, will likely limit the expected number of people that could be prevented from getting infected due to vaccination. A shrinking susceptible pool may also be an attributable reason for the observed lack of statistical difference among the outcomes of the prioritization strategies. However, the invariance of the strategies should give more latitude for decision makers in COVID-19 vaccine distribution.","Tatapudi, H. A.; Das, R.; Das, T.

23386,Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Serology persistence over time in COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Donors.,"BackgroundCharacterizing the kinetics of the antibody response to SARS{square}CoV{square}2 is of critical importance to developing strategies that may mitigate the public health burden of COVID-19. We sought to determine how circulating antibody levels change over time following natural infection.

Methods/MaterialsWe conducted a prospective, longitudinal analysis of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors at multiple time points over a 9-month period. At each study visit, subjects either donated plasma or only had study samples drawn. In all cases, anti-SARS-CoV-2 donor testing was performed using semi-quantitative chemiluminescent immunoassays (ChLIA) targeting subunit 1 (S1) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, and an in-house fluorescence reduction neutralization assay (FRNA).

ResultsFrom April to November 2020 we enrolled 202 donors, mean age 47.3 {+/-}14.7 years, 55% female, 75% Caucasian. Most donors reported a mild clinical course (91%, n=171) without hospitalization. One hundred and five (105) (52%) donors presented for repeat visits with a median 42 (12-163) days between visits. The final visit occurred at a median 160 (53-273) days post-symptom resolution. Total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Ab), SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies were detected in 97.5%, 91.1%, and 74% of donors respectively at initial presentation. Neutralizing Ab titers based on FRNA50 were positively associated with mean IgG levels (p = <0.0001). Mean IgG levels and neutralizing titers were positively associated with COVID-19 severity, increased donor age and BMI (p=0.0006 and p=0.0028, p=0.0083 and p=0.0363, (p=0.0008 and p=0.0018, respectively). Over the course of repeat visits, IgG decreased in 74.1% of donors; FRNA50 decreased in 44.4% and remained unchanged in 33.3% of repeat donors. A weak negative correlation was observed between total Ab levels and number of days post-symptom recovery (r = 0.09).

ConclusionAnti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were identified in 97% of convalescent donors at initial presentation. In a cohort that largely did not require hospitalization. IgG and neutralizing antibodies were positively correlated with age, BMI and clinical severity, and persisted for up to 9 months post-recovery from natural infection. On repeat presentation, IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 levels decreased in 56% of repeat donors. Overall, these data suggest that CP donors possess a wide range of IgG and neutralizing antibody levels that are proportionally distributed across demographics, with the exception of age, BMI and clinical severity.","De Giorgi, V.; West, K.

20784,"Rates and predictors of uptake of formal and informal mental health support during the COVID-19 pandemic: an analysis of 26,740 adults in the UK in lockdown","PurposeThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put a great strain on peoples mental health. A growing number of studies have shown worsening mental health measures globally during the pandemic. However, there is a lack of empirical study on how people support their mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to examine a number of formal and informal mental health supports. Further, it explored factors that might be associated with the use of different types mental health support.

MethodData from 26,740 adults in the UCL COVID -19 Social Study were analysed between 13th April, 2020 and 3rd July, 2020. Data were analysed using logistic and Poisson regression models.

ResultsAbout 45% of people reported talking to friends or family members to support their mental health, 43% engaging in self-care activities, 20% taking medication, 9% speaking to mental health professionals, 8% talking to a GP or other health professional, and another 8% using helpline or online services. Gender, education, living status, loneliness, pre-existing mental health conditions, general depression and anxiety, coping and personality were found to be associated with the use of mental health support.

ConclusionWhile the negative impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are inevitable, people can play an active role in managing their mental health. Understanding the patterns and predictors of various kinds of mental health support during the pandemic is crucial for future service planning and delivery through recognising potential barriers to mental health care faced by certain groups.","Bu, F.; Mak, H.

17581,Growth of respiratory droplets in cold and humid air,"The ambient conditions surrounding liquid droplets determine their growth or shrinkage. However, the precise fate of a liquid droplet expelled from a respiratory puff as dictated by its surroundings and the puff itself has not yet been fully quantified. From the view of airborne disease transmission, such as SARS-CoV-2, knowledge of such dependencies are critical. Here we employ direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a turbulent respiratory vapour puff and account for the mass and temperature exchange with respiratory droplets and aerosols. In particular, we investigate how droplets respond to different ambient temperatures and relative humidity (RH) by tracking their Lagrangian statistics. We reveal and quantify that in cold and humid environments, as there the respiratory puff is supersaturated, expelled droplets can first experience significant growth, and only later followed by shrinkage, in contrast to the monotonic shrinkage of droplets as expected from the classical view by William F. Wells (1934). Indeed, cold and humid environments diminish the ability of air to hold water vapour, thus causing the respiratory vapour puff to super-saturate. Consequently, the super-saturated vapour field drives the growth of droplets that are caught and transported within the humid puff. To analytically predict the likelihood for droplet growth, we propose a model for the axial RH based on the assumption of a quasi-stationary jet. Our model correctly predicts super-saturated RH conditions and is in good quantitative agreement with our DNS. Our results culminate in a temperature-RH map that can be employed as an indicator for droplet growth or shrinkage.

Significance StatementInfluence of environmental conditions on airborne diseases transmission is an important issue, especially during the pandemic of COVID-19. Human-to-human transmission is mediated by the transport of virus-laden respiratory droplets. Here we investigate the problem from a fluid mechanics perspective by conducting numerical simulations to quantify the fate of respiratory droplets in a warm humid coughing puff under different ambient conditions. We reveal a non-intuitive regime with considerable growth of respiratory droplets, dominated by a super-saturated vapour field, preferentially occurring in cold and humid environments. We further propose a theoretical model that accurately predicts the condition for droplet growth. Our work should inform socializing policies and ventilation strategies for controlling indoor ambient conditions to mitigate dispersion of droplets from asymptomatic individuals.","Ng, C.

3644,Glucocorticoids inhibit type I IFN beta signaling and the upregulation of CD73 in human lung,"PurposeGlucocorticoids are widely used to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) despite its use is highly controversial based on randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. As type I interferons (IFNs) are our first line of defense against severe viral respiratory infections, we explored whether glucocorticoids interfere with IFN signaling and whether their use associates to outcome of IFN beta treatment of ARDS.

MethodsWe performed a propensity-matched post-hoc-analysis using data from the recent randomized INTEREST-trial comparing IFN beta-1a to placebo in ARDS patients. Based on the results of these analyses we utilized human lung tissue and human pulmonary endothelial cell cultures to investigate the effect of hydrocortisone on IFN nuclear signaling and the protein transcription of CD73, a molecule responsible for vascular integrity.

ResultsWe found that hydrocortisone reduces the production, and prevents the nuclear translocation of IRF9, that is required for IFN beta-dependent signaling of multiple IFN-induced genes. In addition, hydrocortisone inhibits IFN beta-dependent upregulation of CD73 in human lung tissue. Additionally, we found that use of glucocorticoids with IFN beta-1a was independently associated with increased mortality (OR 5.4, 95% CI 2.1-13.9, P< 0.001) in the INTEREST-trial.

ConclusionsGlucocorticoids inhibit type I IFN beta signaling and the upregulation of CD73 in human lung. This provides the mechanistic basis for the harmful association of glucocorticoids in IFN beta treated patients in the INTEREST-trial. Most importantly, it strongly speaks against the use of glucocorticoids in viral-induced ARDS such as in the current corona virus pandemia.

Take home messageGlucocorticoids inhibit type I interferon beta signaling and the upregulation of CD73 that is a key molecule preventing vascular leakage and harmful leukocyte infiltration into the lungs.

11359,Serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 after mild and severe COVID-19 infection and analysis of IgG non-responders,"BackgroundTo accurately interpret COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys, knowledge of serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 with a better understanding of patients who do not seroconvert, is imperative. This study aimed to describe serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of patients with both severe and mild COVID-19, including extended studies of patients who remained seronegative more than 90 days post symptom onset.

ResultsForty-seven patients (mean age 49 years, 38% female) were included. All (15/15) patients with severe symptoms and 29/32 (90.6%) patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in serum. Time to seroconversion was significantly shorter (median 11 vs. 22 days, P=0.04) in patients with severe compared to mild symptoms. Of the three patients without detectable IgG-responses after >90 days, all had detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies and in two, spike-protein receptor binding domain-specific IgG was detected with an in-house assay. Antibody titers were preserved during follow-up and all patients who seroconverted, irrespective of the severity of symptoms, still had detectable IgG levels >75 days post symptom onset.

ConclusionsPatients with severe COVID-19 both seroconvert earlier and develop higher concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG than patients with mild symptoms. Of those patients who not develop detectable IgG antibodies, all have detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies, suggesting immunity. Our results showing that not all COVID-19 patients develop detectable IgG using two validated commercial clinical methods, even over time, are vital for the interpretation of COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys and for estimating the true infection prevalence in populations.","Marklund, E.; Leach, S.; Axelsson, H.; Nordström, K.; Norder, H.; Bemark, M.; Angeletti, D.; Lundgren, A.; Nilsson, S.; Andersson, L.-M.; Yilmaz, A.; Lindh, M.; Liljeqvist, J.-A.; Gisslen, M.",2020-07-11,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.07.11.20151324,1,Magnus Gisslén,University of Gothenburg,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.20151324v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.20151324v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1371/journal.pone.0241104
10366,Health Condition and Test Availability as Predictors of Adults' Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"BackgroundResearch identifying adults mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic relies solely on demographic predictors without examining adults health status during the COVID-19 pandemic as a potential predictor.

MethodsAn online survey of 669 adults in Malaysia was conducted during May 2-8, 2020, six weeks after a Movement Control Order (MCO) was issued.

FindingsAdults health condition had curvilinear relationships (horizontally reversed J-shaped) with insomnia, anxiety, depression and distress. Reported test availability for COVID-19 (from """"strongly disagree"""" to """"strongly agree"""") also had curvilinear relationships (horizontally reversed J-shaped) with anxiety and depression. Younger adults reported worse mental health, but people from various religions and ethnic groups did not differ significantly in reported mental health.

InterpretationAdults with worse health conditions had more mental health problems, especially adults at the lower end of the health spectrum. Test availability negatively predicted anxiety and depression, especially for adults experiencing poor COVID-19 test availability. The significant predictions of health condition and COVID-19 test availability suggest a new direction for the literature to identify psychiatric risk factors directly from health related variables during a pandemic.

16482,Determinants of Developing Symptomatic Disease in Ethiopian COVID-19 Patients,"BackgroundStudies show that having some symptoms seems to be associated with more severe disease and poor prognosis. Therefore, knowing who is more susceptible to symptomatic COVID-19 disease is important to provide targeted preventive and management practice. The aim of the study was to assess the determinants of having symptomatic disease among COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.

MethodsA case-control study was conducted from August to September 2020 among a randomly selected 765 COVID-19 patients (372 Asymptomatic and 393 Symptomatic patients). Chi-square test and independent t-test were used to detect the presence of a statistically significant difference in the characteristics of the cases (symptomatic) and controls (asymptomatic), where p-value of <0.05 considered as having a statistically significant difference. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to assess a statistically significant association between the independent variables and developing symptomatic COVID-19 where Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR, and P-values were used for testing significance and interpretation of results.

ResultsThe result of the multivariable binary logistic regression shows that age group (AOR= 1.818, 95% CI= 1.210, 2.731, p-value=0.004 for 30-39 years; AOR= 1.611, 95% CI= 1.016, 2.554, p-value=0.043 for 40-49 years and AOR= 4.076, 95% CI= 2.582, 6.435, p-value=0.0001 for years and above), sex (AOR= 1.672, 95% CI= 1.216, 2.299, p-value=0.002) and history of diabetes mellitus (AOR= 2.406, 95% CI= 1.384, 4.181, p-value=0.002) were found to be significant factors that determine the development of symptomatic disease in COVID-19 patients.

ConclusionsDeveloping a symptomatic COVID-19 disease was found to be determined by exposures of old age, male sex, and being diabetic. Therefore, patients with the above factors should be given enough attention in the prevention and management process, including inpatient management, to pick symptoms earlier and to manage accordingly so that these patients can have a favorable treatment outcome.","Leulseged, T.

21003,Invasive Mould Disease in Fatal COVID-1 19: A Systematic Review of Autopsies,"BackgroundInvasive mould disease (IMD) - most commonly pulmonary aspergillosis - is reported to affect up to a third of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Most reported cases are diagnosed with probable/putative COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) based on a combination of non-specific clinical, radiographic, and mycological findings, but the clinical significance - and whether these cases represent true invasive disease - is unresolved.

MethodsWe performed a systematic review of autopsy series of decedents with COVID-19 for evidence of IMD. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, OVID (Embase) and MedRxiv for English- or French-language case series published between January 1, 2019 to September 26, 2020. We included series describing lung histology of [&ge;]3 decedents, and authors were contacted for missing information as necessary.

FindingsWe identified 51 case series describing autopsies of 702 decedents. Individual-level data was available for 430 decedents. The median age was 72 (IQR 61 to 80) years. Diabetes mellitus, pre-existing lung disease, and immunocompromising conditions were reported for 129 (32%), 95 (22%), and 25 (6%) decedents, respectively. The median hospitalization length was 10 (IQR 5-22) days. 51.6% of decedents had received mechanical ventilation for a median of nine (IQR 5-20) days. Treatment included immunomodulation in 60 (most often steroids or tocilizumab) and antifungals in 41 decedents. Eleven decedents (1{middle dot}6%) had autopsy-confirmed IMD (6 with CAPA, 4 with invasive pulmonary mycosis not specified and 1 with disseminated mucormycosis). Among 173 decedents who received mechanical ventilation, 5 had IMD (2{middle dot}9%).

InterpretationAutopsy-proven IMD, including CAPA, is uncommon in fatal COVID-19.

24496,"Accessibility, inclusivity, and implementation of COVID-19 clinical management guidelines early in the pandemic: a global survey","BackgroundWith a rapidly changing evidence base, high-quality clinical management guidelines (CMGs) are key tools for aiding clinical decision making and increasing access to best available evidence-based care. A rapid review of COVID-19 CMGs found that most lacked methodological rigour, overlooked many at-risk populations, and had variations in treatment recommendations. Furthermore, social science literature highlights the complexity of implementing guidelines in local contexts where they were not developed and the resulting potential to compound health inequities. The aim of this study was to evaluate access to, inclusivity of, and implementation of Covid-19 CMGs in different settings.

MethodsA cross-sectional survey of clinicians worldwide from 15 June to 20 July 2020, to explore access to and implementation of Covid-19 CMGs and treatment and supportive care recommendations provided. Data on accessibility, inclusivity, and implementation of CMGs. were analyzed by geographic location.

ResultsSeventy-six clinicians, from 27 countries responded, 82% from high-income countries, 17% from low-middle income countries. Most respondents reported access to Covid-19 CMG and confidence in implementation of these. However, many respondents, particularly from LMICs reported barriers to implementation, including limited access to treatments and equipment. Only 20% of respondents reported having access to CMGs covering care for children, 25% for pregnant women and 50% for older adults (>65 years). Themes emerging were for CMGs to include recommendations for different at-risk populations, and settings, include supportive care guidance, be readily updated as evidence emerges, and CMG implementation supported by training, and access to treatments recommended.

ConclusionOur findings highlight important gaps in Covid-19 CMG development and implementation challenges during a pandemic, particularly affecting different at-risk populations and lower resourced settings., to improve access in evidence-based care recommendations during an emergency. The findings identifies an urgent need for an improved framework for CMG development, that is inclusive and adaptable to emerging evidence and considers contextual implementation support, to improve access to evidence-based care globally.","Pilbeam, C.; Malden, D.; Newell, K.; Dagens, A.; Kennon, K.; Michelen, M.; Gobat, N.; Sigfrid, L.",2021-04-02,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.03.31.21254680,2,Louise Sigfrid,"International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) Global Support Centre, Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health,  Univer",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.31.21254680v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.31.21254680v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
8954,Emergency calls are early indicators of ICU bed requirement during the COVID-19 epidemic,"BackgroundAlthough the number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds is crucial during the COVID-19 epidemic caring for the most critically ill infected patients, there is no recognized early indicator to anticipate ICU bed requirements.

MethodsIn the Ile-de-France region, from February 20 to May 5, 2020, emergency medical service (EMS) calls and the response provided (ambulances) together the percentage of positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, general practitioner (GP) and emergency department (ED) visits, and hospital admissions of COVID-19 patients were recorded daily and compared to the number of COVID-19 ICU patients. Correlation curve analysis was performed to determine the best correlation coefficient (R), depending on the number of days the indicator has been shifted. A delay [&ge;]7 days was considered as an early alert, and a delay [&ge;]14 days a very early alert.

FindingsEMS calls, percentage of positive RT-PCR tests, ambulances used, ED and GP visits of COVID-19 patients were strongly associated with COVID-19 ICU patients with an anticipation delay of 23, 15, 14, 13, and 12 days respectively. Hospitalization did not anticipate ICU bed requirement.

InterpretationThe daily number of COVID19-related telephone calls received by the EMS and corresponding dispatch ambulances, and the proportion of positive RT-PCR tests were the earliest indicators of the number of COVID19 patients requiring ICU care during the epidemic crisis in the Ile-de-France region, rapidly followed by ED and GP visits. This information may help health authorities to anticipate a future epidemic, including a second wave of COVID19 or decide additional social measures.

FundingOnly institutional funding was provided.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed and preprint archives for articles published up to May 17, 2020, that contained information about the anticipation of intensive care unit (ICU) bed requirement during the COVID-19 outbreak using the terms """"coronavirus"""", """"2009-nCOV"""", """"COVID-19"""", SARS-CoV2"""", """"prediction"""" """"resource"""" and """"intensive care"""". We also reviewed relevant references in retrieved articles and the publicly available publication list of the COVID-19 living systematic review.22 This list contains studies on covid-19 published on PubMed and Embase through Ovid, bioRxiv, and medRxiv, and is continuously updated. Although many studies estimated the number of patients who would have severe COVID-19 requiring ICU, very few contained assessment for early signals (from internet or social media), and we retrieved no study whose data came from suspected or infected patients.

Added values of this studyDuring the COVID-19 epidemic, emergency medical system (EMS) calls, percentage of positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, ambulance dispatch, emergency department (ED) and general practitioner (GP) visits of COVID-19 patients were strongly associated with COVID-19 ICU patients with an anticipation delay of 23, 15, 14, 13, and 12 days respectively. Hospitalization did not anticipated COVID-19 ICU bed requirement.

Implication of all available evidenceEMS calls and ambulance dispatch, percent of positive RT-PCR, and ED and GP visits could be valuable tools as daily alert signals to set up plan to face the burden of ICU bed requirement during the initial wave of the COVID-19 epidemic, and may possibly also help anticipating a second wave.

15003,Influence of Malaria Edemicity and TB Prevalence / BCG Coverage on COVID-19 Mortality,"BackgroundRegarding SARS-CoV-2 it is well known that a substantial percentage of adult population cannot get infected if exposed to this novel coronavirus. Several studies give primary indication about the possible role of preexisting immunity whether cross immunity or not. Possible role of latent TB, BCG and malaria have been already suggested to create innate cross heterogeneous immunity. We look for influence of these factors on Covid-19 mortality in malarious countries.

Material and methods80 malarious countries were enrolled in this study. Hierarchical multiple regression type of analysis was used for data analyses. TB prevalence/ 100,000 population standardized to BCG coverage rates was taken as direct factor in the test. Malaria incidence /1000 population was considered as intermediate factor and the outcome was COVID-19 mortality/ 1 million (M) population.

ResultsHierarchical multiple regression analysis showed significant associations between standardized TB prevalence to BCG coverage and reduced COVID-19 mortality. This analysis also showed that malaria have an additional effect in reducing COVID-19 mortality with high significant association too.

ConclusionsMalaria and standardized TB prevalence are statistical significant factors predicting COVID-19 mortality in negative associations.","Raham, T.

8780,Genetic variants of PIEZO1 associate with COVID-19 fatality,"COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, carries significant risk of mortality and has spread globally with devastating societal consequences. Endothelial infection has been identified as a feature of the disease and so there is motivation to determine the relevance of endothelial membrane mechanisms affecting viral entry and response. Here, through a study of patient data in UK Biobank released on 16 April 2020, we suggest relevance of PIEZO1, a non-selective cation channel protein that both mediates endothelial responses to mechanical force and unusually indents the cell membrane. PIEZO1 notably has roles that may also be relevant in red blood cell function, pulmonary inflammation, bacterial infection and fibrotic auto-inflammation. We provide evidence that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding PIEZO1 are more common in individuals who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 regardless of pre-existing hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes mellitus or arthritis. Some of these SNPs are more common in African and Caribbean populations, which are groups that were recently shown to have greater susceptibility to infection. One of the SNPs is a missense mutation that results in an amino acid change in an evolutionarily conserved and previously unexplored N-terminal region PIEZO1. The data support the notion of genetic factors influencing SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest a specific role for PIEZO1.","Cheng, C. W.; Deivasikamani, V.; Ludlow, M. J.; De Vecchis, D.; Kalli, A.

20913,Development of at-home sample collection logistics for large scale SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies,"In the midst of a pandemic, serologic studies are a valuable tool to understand the course of the outbreak and guide public health and general pandemic management. However, given significant safety constraints including social distancing and stay-at-home orders, sample collection becomes more difficult given traditional phlebotomy protocols. For such studies, a representative sample of the underlying population is paramount to elicit meaningful insights that capture the spread of the infection, particularly when different sub-populations face varying disease burden. We aimed to address these challenges by conducting a fully remote study to investigate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the state of Massachusetts. Leveraging electronic study engagement and at-home self-collection of finger-prick samples, we enrolled 2,066 participants representative of the ethnic and racial composition of Massachusetts. SARS-CoV-2 total IgG seropositivity was 3.15%, and follow-up measurements at days 7, 15, 45, and 90 indicate a generally durable antibody response. A higher risk of infection was observed for healthcare workers and their cohabitants and those with comorbidities, as well as lower-income, less educated, Hispanic, and those in the age groups of 18-29 and 50-59-years-old. High engagement and positive feedback from the participants and quality of self-collected specimens point to the usefulness of this design for future population-level serological studies that more effectively and safely reach a broad representative cohort, thus yielding more comprehensive insights into the burden of infection and disease in populations.

22859,"COVID-19 Vaccine hesitancy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: A mixed-methods study","BackgroundCOVID-19 infection is a global pandemic threatening the public health. Due to the development and initiation of vaccination, currently significant difference upon vaccine acceptance is seen between developed and developing countries. However, there are no data on the level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its associated factors in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

MethodsAn embedded mixed method study [QUAN(quali)] was conducted among residents of Akaki Kality sub-city in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. For the quantitative part, a multi-stage sampling technique was used to recruit the study participants (n = 422). Twenty four adults were included purposively for the qualitative in-depth interview. Data was collected by face-to-face interview by using a semi-structured questionnaire. Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were identified by multivariable binary logistic regression model.

ResultThe mean age of the participants was 34.1 years ({+/-}12.9). Nearly half (46.7%) of the participants exhibited poor level of knowledge and 51.8% had negative attitude towards COVID-19 and its preventive measures. One out five (19.1%) participants were not willing to get vaccinated when it becomes available. In the multivariable analysis, vaccine hesitancy was significantly associated with being female (aOR=1.97; 95% CI: 1.10 - 3.89, p=0.03), negative attitude towards COVID-19 and its preventive measures (aOR=1.75; 95% CI: 1.08 - 3.02, p=0.04), and information source being social media (internet) (aOR=3.59; 95% CI: 1.75 - 7.37, P <0.0001).

ConclusionA considerable proportion of the people in Addis Ababa have concerns on COVID-19 vaccine and unwilling to accept once it is available. Several conspiracy theories were put forth to justify their stance and this was mainly due to the misconceptions distributed from the use of social media as source of information. Overall, providing the community with health education and consistent government efforts in uphold the prevention measures are of paramount importance to tackle this pandemic.","Dereje, N.; Tesfaye, A.; Tamene, B.; Alemshet, D.; Abe, H.; Tesfa, N.; Gedion, S.; Biruk, T.; Lakew, Y.",2021-03-01,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.02.25.21252443,1,Nebiyu Dereje,Myungsung Medical College,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.25.21252443v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.25.21252443v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
20100,Occupational exposures associated with being a COVID-19 case; evidence from three case-control studies,"BackgroundThe evidence on risk factors for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in community settings is sparse, yet this information is key to inform public health action. We investigated factors associated with being a COVID-19 case using data collected through contact tracing.

MethodsWe conducted three retrospective, frequency-matched case-control studies between August 2020 and October 2020 using case data from the NHS Test and Trace programme. Controls were obtained through Market Research Panels. Multivariable analyses provided adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for multiple community exposure settings. We analysed the results in meta-analyses using random effects models to obtain pooled odds ratios (pORs).

ResultsAcross all study periods, there was strong statistical evidence that working in healthcare (pOR 2.87, aOR range 2.72-3.08), social care (pOR 4.15, aOR range 2.46-5.41) or hospitality (pOR 2.36, aOR range 2.01-2.63) were associated with increased odds of being a COVID-19 case. There was also evidence that working in warehouse setting was associated with increased odds (pOR 3.86, aOR range 1.06-14.19), with a substantial increase in odds observed over the study periods. A similar pattern was also observed in education and construction.

ConclusionsThe studies indicate that some workplace settings are associated with increased odds of being a case. However, it is not possible to determine how much of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 took place within the workplace, and how much was associated with social, household or transport exposures.","Hiironen, I.; Saavedra-Campos, M.; Panitz, J.; Ma, T.; Nsonwu, O.; Charlett, A.; Hughes, G.; Oliver, I.",2020-12-22,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.12.21.20248161,1,Iina Hiironen,National Infection Service - Public Health England,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.21.20248161v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.21.20248161v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
15564,Empirical transmission advantage of the D614G mutant strain of SARS-CoV-2,"The SARS-CoV-2 lineage carrying the amino acid change D614G has become the dominant variant in the global COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid spread of the G614 mutant suggests that it may have a transmission advantage over the D614 wildtype. Using our previous epidemiological framework to analyze COVID-19 surveillance and sequence data, we estimated that the G614 mutant is 31% (28-34%) more transmissible than the D614 wildtype. As such, interventions that were previously effective in containing or mitigating the D614 wildtype (e.g. in China, Vietnam, Thailand, etc.) might be less effective against the G614 mutant.

17644,Personalized Prescription of ACEI/ARBs for Hypertensive COVID-19 Patients,"The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted an international effort to develop and repurpose medications and procedures to effectively combat the disease. Several groups have focused on the potential treatment utility of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) for hypertensive COVID-19 patients, with inconclusive evidence thus far. We couple electronic medical record (EMR) and registry data of 3,643 patients from Spain, Italy, Germany, Ecuador, and the US with a machine learning framework to personalize the prescription of ACEIs and ARBs to hypertensive COVID-19 patients. Our approach leverages clinical and demographic information to identify hospitalized individuals whose probability of mortality or morbidity can decrease by prescribing this class of drugs. In particular, the algorithm proposes increasing ACEI/ARBs prescriptions for patients with cardiovascular disease and decreasing prescriptions for those with low oxygen saturation at admission. We show that personalized recommendations can improve patient outcomes by 1.0% compared to the standard of care when applied to external populations. We develop an interactive interface for our algorithm, providing physicians with an actionable tool to easily assess treatment alternatives and inform clinical decisions. This work offers the first personalized recommendation system to accurately evaluate the efficacy and risks of prescribing ACEIs and ARBs to hypertensive COVID-19 patients.

Highlights- This paper introduces a data-driven approach for personalizing the prescription of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) for hypertensive COVID-19 patients.
- Leveraging an international cohort of more than 3,500 patients, we identify clinical and demographic characteristics that may affect the effectiveness of ACEIs/ARBs for COVID-19 patients, such as low oxygen saturation at admission.
- We developed a user-friendly online application that is available to physicians to facilitate interpretation and communication of the results of the algorithm.","Bertsimas, D.; Borenstein, A.; Mingardi, L.; Nohadani, O.; Orfanoudaki, A.; Stellato, B.; Wiberg, H.; Sarin, P.; Varelmann, D.; Estrada, V.; Macaya, C.; Nunez Gil, I.",2020-11-04,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.30.20223594,1,Dimitris Bertsimas,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.20223594v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.20223594v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1007/s10729-021-09545-5
7867,C-Reactive protein and SOFA score as early predictors of critical care requirement in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Spain.,"BackgroundSome patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 in the recent pandemic have required critical care, becoming one of the main limitations of the health systems. Our objective has been to identify potential markers at admission predicting the need for critical care in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

MethodsWe retrospectively collected and analyzed data from electronic medical records of patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-19 infection by real-time RT-PCR. A comparison was made between patients staying in the hospitalization ward with those who required critical care. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to identify risk factors predicting critical care need.

FindingsBetween March 15 and April 15, 2020, 150 patients under the age of 75 were selected (all with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-19 infection), 75 patients requiring intensive care assistance and 75 remaining the regular hospitalization ward. Most patients requiring critical care were males, 76% compared with 60% in the non-critical care group (p<0.05). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital critical care associated with increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (odds ratio 1.052 (1.009-1.101); p=0.0043) and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (1.968 (1.389-2.590) p<0.0001) both at the time of hospital admission. The AUC-ROC for the combined model was 0.83 (0.76-0.90) (vs AUC-ROC SOFA p<0.05).

InterpretationPatients COVID-19 positive presenting at admission with high SOFA score [&ge;]2 combined with CRP [&ge;] 9,1 mg/mL could help clinicians to identify them as a group that will more likely require critical care so further actions might be implemented to improve their prognosis.","Vaquero, L.

10385,Expert-level prenatal detection of complex congenital heart disease from screening ultrasound using deep learning,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect. Fetal survey ultrasound is recommended worldwide, including five views of the heart that together could detect 90% of complex CHD. In practice, however, sensitivity is as low as 30%. We hypothesized poor detection results from challenges in acquiring and interpreting diagnostic-quality cardiac views, and that deep learning could improve complex CHD detection. Using 107,823 images from 1,326 retrospective echocardiograms and surveys from 18-24 week fetuses, we trained an ensemble of neural networks to (i) identify recommended cardiac views and (ii) distinguish between normal hearts and complex CHD. Finally, (iii) we used segmentation models to calculate standard fetal cardiothoracic measurements. In a test set of 4,108 fetal surveys (0.9% CHD, >4.4 million images, about 400 times the size of the training dataset) the model achieved an AUC of 0.99, 95% sensitivity (95%CI, 84-99), 96% specificity (95%CI, 95-97), and 100% NPV in distinguishing normal from abnormal hearts. Sensitivity was comparable to clinicians task-for-task and remained robust on external and lower-quality images. The models decisions were based on clinically relevant features. Cardiac measurements correlated with reported measures for normal and abnormal hearts. Applied to guidelines-recommended imaging, ensemble learning models could significantly improve detection of fetal CHD and expand telehealth options for prenatal care at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has further limited patient access to trained providers. This is the first use of deep learning to [~]double standard clinical performance on a critical and global diagnostic challenge.","Arnaout, R.; Curran, L.; Zhao, Y.; Levine, J.; Chinn, E.; Moon-Grady, A.",2020-06-24,Radiology And Imaging,10.1101/2020.06.22.20137786,1,Rima Arnaout,UCSF,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.20137786v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.20137786v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
14592,Severe COVID-19 infection is associated with increased antibody-mediated platelet apoptosis,"The pathophysiology of COVID-19 associated thrombosis seems to be multifactorial, involving interplay between cellular and plasmatic elements of the hemostasis. We hypothesized that COVID-19 is accompanied by platelet apoptosis with subsequent alteration of the coagulation system. We investigated depolarization of mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential ({Delta}{Psi}m), cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) concentration, and phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization by flow cytometry. Platelets from intensive care unit (ICU) COVID-19 patients (n=21) showed higher {Delta}{Psi}m depolarization, cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and PS externalization, compared to healthy controls (n=18) and COVID-19 non-ICU patients (n=4). Moreover significant higher cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and PS was observed compared to septic ICU control group (ICU control). In ICU control group (n=5; ICU non-COVID-19) cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and PS externalization was comparable to healthy control, with an increase {Delta}{Psi}m depolarization. Sera from ICU COVID-19 13 patients induced significant increase in apoptosis markers ({Delta}{Psi}m depolarization, cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and PS externalization). compared to healthy volunteer and septic ICU control. Interestingly, immunoglobulin G (IgG) fractions from COVID-19 patients induced an Fc gamma receptor IIA dependent platelet apoptosis ({Delta}{Psi}m depolarization, cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and PS externalization). Enhanced PS externalization in platelets from ICU COVID-19 patients was associated with increased sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score (r=0.5635) and DDimer (r=0.4473). Most importantly, patients with thrombosis had significantly higher PS externalization compared to those without. The strong correlations between apoptosis markers and increased D-Dimer levels as well as the incidence of thrombosis may indicate that antibody-mediated platelet apoptosis potentially contributes to sustained increased thromboembolic risk in ICU COVID-19 patients.

6551,ProgNet: Covid-19 prognosis using recurrent andconvolutional neural networks,"--Humanity is facing nowadays a dramatic pandemic episode with the Coronavirus propagation over all continents. The Covid-19 disease is still not well characterized, and many research teams all over the world are working on either therapeutic or vaccination issues. Massive testing is one of the main recommendations. In addition to laboratory tests, imagery-based tools are being widely investigated. Artificial intelligence is therefore contributing to the efforts made to face this pandemic phase.

Regarding patients in hospitals, it is important to monitor the evolution of lung pathologies due to the virus. A prognosis is therefore of great interest for doctors to adapt their care strategy. In this paper, we propose a method for Covid-19 prognosis based on deep learning architectures. The proposed method is based on the combination of a convolutional and recurrent neural networks to classify multi-temporal chest X-ray images and predict the evolution of the observed lung pathology. When applied to radiological time-series, promising results are obtained with an accuracy rates higher than 92%.","Fakhfakh, M.; Bouaziz, B.; Gargouri, F.; Chaari, L.",2020-05-08,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.05.06.20092874,1,Lotfi Chaari,Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.20092874v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.20092874v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.2174/1874347102012010011
12815,The characteristics of multi-source mobility datasets and how they reveal the luxury nature of social distancing in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic,"This study reveals the human mobility from various sources and the luxury nature of social distancing in the U.S during the COVID-19 pandemic by highlighting the disparities in mobility dynamics from lower-income and upper-income counties. We collect, process, and compute mobility data from four sources: 1) Apple mobility trend reports, 2) Google community mobility reports, 3) mobility data from Descartes Labs, and 4) Twitter mobility calculated via weighted distance. We further design a Responsive Index (RI) based on the time series of mobility change percentages to quantify the general degree of mobility-based responsiveness to COVID-19 at the U.S. county level. We find statistically significant positive correlations in the RI between either two data sources, revealing their general similarity, albeit with varying Pearsons r coefficients. Despite the similarity, however, mobility from each source presents unique and even contrasting characteristics, in part demonstrating the multifaceted nature of human mobility. The positive correlation between RI and income at the county level is significant in all mobility datasets, suggesting that counties with higher income tend to react more aggressively in terms of reducing more mobility in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most states present a positive difference in RI between their upper-income and lower-income counties, where diverging patterns in time series of mobility changes percentages can be found. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that cross-compares multi-source mobility datasets. The findings shed light on not only the characteristics of multi-source mobility data but also the mobility patterns in tandem with the economic disparity.

13712,Exhaled SARS-CoV-2 quantified by face-mask sampling in hospitalised patients with covid-19,"BackgroundHuman to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is driven by the respiratory route but little is known about the pattern and quantity of virus output from exhaled breath. We have previously shown that face-mask sampling (FMS) can detect exhaled tubercle bacilli and have adapted its use to quantify exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19.

MethodsBetween May and December 2020, we took two concomitant FMS and nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) over two days, starting within 24 hours of a routine virus positive NPS in patients hospitalised with covid-19, at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, UK. Participants were asked to wear a modified duckbilled facemask for 30 minutes, followed by a nasopharyngeal swab. Demographic, clinical, and radiological data, as well as International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) mortality and deterioration scores were obtained.

Exposed masks were processed by removal, dissolution and analysis of sampling matrix strips fixed within the mask by RT-qPCR. Viral genome copy numbers were determined and results classified as Negative; Low: [&le;]999 copies; Medium: 1,000-99,999 copies and High [&ge;] 100,000 copies per strip for FMS or per 100{micro}l for NPS.

Results102 FMS and NPS were collected from 66 routinely positive patients; median age: 61 (IQR 49 - 77), of which FMS was positive in 37% of individuals and concomitant NPS was positive in 50%. Positive FMS viral loads varied over five orders of magnitude (<10-3.3 x 106 genome copies/strip); 21 (32%) patients were asymptomatic at the time of sampling. High FMS viral load was associated with respiratory symptoms at time of sampling and shorter interval between sampling and symptom onset (FMS High: median (IQR) 2 days (2-3) vs FMS Negative: 7 days (7-10), p=0.002). On multivariable linear regression analysis, higher FMS viral loads were associated with higher ISARIC mortality (Medium FMS vs Negative FMS gave an adjusted coefficient of 15.7, 95% CI 3.7-27.7, p=0.01) and deterioration scores (High FMS vs Negative FMS gave an adjusted coefficient of 37.6, 95% CI 14.0 to 61.3, p=0.002), while NPS viral loads showed no significant association.

ConclusionWe demonstrate a simple and effective method for detecting and quantifying exhaled SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalised patients with covid-19. Higher FMS viral loads were more likely to be associated with developing severe disease compared to NPS viral loads. Similar to NPS, FMS viral load was highest in early disease and in those with active respiratory symptoms, highlighting the potential role of FMS in understanding infectivity.","Williams, C.; Pan, D.; Decker, J.; Fletcher, E.; Wisniewska, A.; Sze, S.; Assadi, S.; Haigh, R.; Abdulwhhab, M.; Bird, P.; Holmes, C.; Al-Taie, A.; Saleem, B.; Pan, J.; Garton, N.; Pareek, M.; Barer, M.",2021-02-21,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.18.20176693,2,Caroline Williams,University of Leicester,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20176693v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20176693v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
18877,What do we Know about smell and taste dysfunction by SARS-CoV-2.Predictive value of the Venezuelan Olfactory test and RT-PCR analysis in viral infection diagnosis,"BackgroundSmell and taste disorders are reported very frequently and at an early stage in the evolution of the infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2. These symptoms could be sensitive and specific to establish the condition of the infection, and may suggest the flow of decisions as to further therapy. We asked whether smell and taste impairment are earlier and more sensitive symptoms than the RT-PCR molecular assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

MethodologySubjects (N=275) with a probable COVID19 diagnosis were classified as follows: Symptomatic with chemosensory dysfunction, symptomatic without chemosensory dysfunction, and asymptomatic. Subjects received a general clinical and otorhinolaryngology examination. Evaluation of the chemosensory dysfunction was performed by means of the Venezuelan Olfactory Test and taste test. Nasal swabs and blood samples were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis (RT-PCR) and a rapid diagnostic test to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus and antiviral antibodies, respectively. Patients had access to molecular tests and smell and taste evaluations every 3 to 5 days until they recovered.

ResultsOut of 44 patients that were positive for RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2: 45.83% had smell and taste disorders and COVID19 symptoms, 23.61% did not have smell or taste disorders, but had COVID19 symptoms, and 30.55% were asymptomatic. Mild hyposmia and hypogeusia account for the most frequent chemosensory disorders accompanying common SARS-CoV-2 symptoms. Time to recover from the chemosensory dysfunction ranges from 3 to 14 days, up to a maximum of 5 weeks, while RT-PCR becomes negative after 21 days and up to 35 days in some cases. The Venezuelan Olfactory Test and taste test has a 61.68% positive predictive value, 45.83% sensitivity, and 68.7% specificity for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ConclusionsSmell and taste disorders are frequent symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but not a significant predictor of the disease, as compared to the molecular RT-PCR test.","Pieruzzini, R.; Ayala-Grosso, C.; Navas, J.

Our aim was to infer the levels of virus importation and to estimate the impact of public health measures related to travel restrictions to local transmission in Greece. Our phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses included 389 SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected during the first 7 months of the pandemic in Greece and a random collection in 5 replicates of 3,000 sequences sampled globally, as well as the best hits to our dataset identified by BLAST. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the presence of 70 genetically distinct viruses identified as independent introductions into Greece. The proportion of imported strains was 41%, 11.5%, and 8.8% during the three periods of sampling, namely, March (no travel restrictions), April to June (strict travel restrictions), and July to September (lifting of travel restrictions based on a thorough risk assessment), respectively. These findings reveal low levels of onward transmission from imported cases during summer and underscore the importance of targeted public health measures that can increase the safety of international travel during a pandemic.","Kostaki, E.

23609,A simplified SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay,"COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic caused by the highly infectious coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that is engaging worldwide scientific research to find a timely and effective eradication strategy. Great efforts have been put into anti-COVID-19 vaccine generation in an effort to protect the world population and block SARS-CoV-2 spread. To validate the protective efficacy of the vaccination campaign and effectively control the pandemy, it is necessary to quantify the neutralizing antibodies induction by vaccination, since they have been established to be a correlate of protection. In this work a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay, based on a replication incompetent lentivirus expressing an adapted form of CoV-2 S protein and an ACE2/TMPRSS2 stably expressing cell line, have been minimized in term of protocol steps without loss of accuracy. The goal of the present simplified neutralization system is to improve SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign by means of an easy and accessible approach to be performed in any medical laboratory, maintaining the sensitivity and quantitative reliability of classical serum neutralization assays. Further this assay can be easily adapted to different coronaviruses variants by simply modifying the pseudotyping vector.","Donofrio, G.; Franceschi, V.; Macchi, F.; Russo, L.; Rocci, A.; Marchica, V.; Costa, F.; Giuliani, N.; Ferrari, C.; Missale, G.",2021-03-12,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.03.12.21253435,1,Gaetano Donofrio,"University of Parma, Department of Medical-Veterinary Science",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.12.21253435v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.12.21253435v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

It was first detected in the city of Wuhan in China and has spread globally resulting in substantial health and economic crisis in many countries. Observational studies have partially identified the different aspects of this disease. Up to this date, no comprehensive systematic review for the clinical, laboratory, epidemiologic and mortality findings has been published. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis for a better understanding of COVID-19.

MethodsWe reviewed the scientific literature published from January 1, 2019 to March 3, 2020. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA (version 14, IC; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). The pooled frequency with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was assessed using random effect model. Publication bias was assessed and p <0.05 was considered a statistically significant publication bias.

ResultsOut of 1102 studies, 32 satisfied the inclusion criteria. A total of 4789 patients with a mean age of 49 years were evaluated. Fever (83.0%, CI 77.5 to 87.6), cough (65.2%, CI 58.6 to 71.2) and myalgia/fatigue (34.7, CI 26.0 to 44.4) were the most common symptoms. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (18.5 %, CI 12.7 to 24.4) and Cardiovascular disease (14.9 %, CI 6.0 to 23.8). Among the laboratory abnormalities, elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (72.0% (CI 54.3 to 84.6) and lymphopenia (50.1%, CI 38.0 to 62.4) were the most common findings. Bilateral ground-glass opacities (66.0%, CI 51.1 to 78.0) was the most common CT-Scan presentation. Pooled mortality rate was 6.6%, with males having significantly higher mortality compared to females (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 9.1, P = 0.01).

ConclusionCOVID-19 commonly presented with a progressive course of cough and fever with more than half of hospitalized patients showing leukopenia or a high CRP on their laboratory findings. Mortality associated with COVID19 was higher than that reported in studies in China with Males having a 3-fold higher risk of mortality in COVID19 compared to females.

6149,Impact of ethnicity on outcome of severe COVID-19 infection. Data from an ethnically diverse UK tertiary centre,"During the current COVID-19 pandemic, it has been suggested that BAME background patients may be disproportionately affected compared to White but few detailed data are available. We took advantage of near real-time hospital data access and analysis pipelines to look at the impact of ethnicity in 1200 consecutive patients admitted between 1st March 2020 and 12th May 2020 to Kings College Hospital NHS Trust in London (UK).

Our key findings are firstly that BAME patients are significantly younger and have different co-morbidity profiles than White individuals. Secondly, there is no significant independent effect of ethnicity on severe outcomes (death or ITU admission) within 14-days of symptom onset, after adjustment for age, sex and comorbidities.","Teo, J.

21881,HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE FOR THE TREATMENT OF SEVERE RESPIRATORY INFECTION BY COVID-19: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL,"The novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) represents a major public health problem due to its rapid spread and its ability to generate severe pneumonia. Thus, it is essential to find a treatment that reduces mortality. Our objective was to estimate whether treatment with 400 mg/day of Hydroxychloroquine for 10 days reduces in-hospital mortality in subjects with severe respiratory disease due to COVID-19 compared with placebo.

Material and methodsA double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of severe disease by COVID-19 through an intention-to-treat analysis. Eligible for the study were adults aged more than 18 years with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR and lung injury requiring hospitalization with or without mechanical ventilation. Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes: days of mechanical ventilation, days of hospitalization and cumulative incidence of serious adverse events.

ResultsA total of 214 patients with COVID-19 were recruited, randomized and analyzed. They were hypoxemic with a mean SpO2 of 65% {+/-} 20, tachycardic (pulse rate 108{+/-}17 min-1) and tachypneic (32 {+/-}10 min-1); 162 were under mechanical ventilation at randomization. Thirty-day mortality was similar in both groups (38% in Hydroxychloroquine vs. 41% in placebo, hazard ratio [HR] 0.88, 95% Confidence Interval [95%CI] 0.51-1.53). In the surviving participants, no significant difference was found in secondary outcomes.

ConclusionNo beneficial effect or significant harm could be demonstrated in our randomized controlled trial including 214 patients, using relatively low doses of Hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19.

21895,Impact of Vaccination and Testing in an Urban Campus model for the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,"The crisis induced by the Coronavirus pandemic has severely impacted educational institutes. Even with vaccination efforts underway, it is not clear that sufficient confidence will be achieved for schools to reopen soon.

This paper considers the impact of vaccination rates and testing rates to reduce infections and hospitalizations and evaluates strategies that will allow educational institute in urban settings to reopen. These strategies are also applicable to businesses and would help plan reopening in order to help the economy.

Our analysis is based on a graph model where nodes represent population groups and edges represent population exchanges due to commuting populations. The commuting population is associated with edges and is associated with one of the end nodes of the edge during part of the time period and with the other node during the remainder of the time period. The progression of the disease at each node is determined via compartment models, that include vaccination rates and testing to place infected people in quarantine along with consideration of asymptomatic and symptomatic populations. Applying this to a university population in Chicago with a substantial commuter population, chosen to be 80% as an illustration, provides an analysis which specifies benefits of testing and vaccination strategies over a time period of 150 days.","Kapoor, S.; Zhang, Y.",2021-02-05,Health Policy,10.1101/2021.02.02.21251040,1,Sanjiv Kapoor,Illinois Institute of Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.02.21251040v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.02.21251040v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
15383,Sex differences in innate anti-viral immune responses to respiratory viruses,"Males have excess morbidity and mortality from respiratory viral infections and especially so in COVID-19. The mechanisms explaining this excess in disease burden in males are unknown. Innate immune responses are likely critical in protection against a novel virus like SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesised that innate immune responses may be deficient in males relative to females. To test this we stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from participants in a population-based birth cohort with three respiratory viruses (rhinoviruses-RV-A16 and RV-A1, and respiratory syncytial virus-RSV) and two viral mimics (R848 and CpG-A, to mimic responses to SARS-CoV-2). We measured interferon (IFN) and IFN-induced chemokine responses and investigated sex differences in virus-induced responses. IFN-, IFN-{beta} and IFN-{gamma} responses to RV-A16 were deficient in males compared to females, fold-inductions being 1.92-fold (P<0.001), 2.04-fold (P<0.001) and 1.77-fold (P=0.003) lower in males than females, respectively. Similar significant deficiencies in innate immune responses were observed in males for eleven other cytokine-stimulus pairs. Responses in males were greater than those in females in only one of 35 cytokine-stimulus pairs investigated. Review of healthcare records revealed that 12.1% of males but only 6.6% of females were admitted to hospital with respiratory infections in the first year of life (P=0.017). Impaired innate anti-viral immunity in males likely results in high morbidity and mortality from respiratory viruses including COVID-19. Males may preferentially benefit from therapies that boost innate anti-viral immune responses.

Significance StatementClinical outcomes including, mortality, Intensive care unit admissions and hospital admissions, during COVID-19 disease are consistently and substantially worse in males than in females. The mechanisms underlying this increased susceptibility to severe disease in males are not understood. We hypothesised that the differential outcomes between sexes could be a consequence of deficient innate interferon responses in males, and more robust innate interferon responses in females. We have investigated such responses in a large population-based cohort and found that indeed males have deficient innate interferon responses to viral stimuli, including stimuli that mimic SARS-CoV-2 infection, relative to females. Our findings have very important treatment implications as interferons are available for clinical use with immediate effect.","Regis, E.; Fontanella, S.; Lin, L.; Howard, R.; Haider, S.; Curtin, J.

8263,The effect of multiple interventions to balance healthcare demand for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks: a modelling study,"BackgroundRecent outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led a rapid global spread around the world. For controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, many countries have implemented two non-pharmaceutical interventions: suppression like immediate lock-downs in cities at epicentre of outbreak; or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both interventions have apparent pros and cons; the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is limited. It is crucial but hard to know how and when to take which level of interventions tailored to the specific situation in each country. We aimed to conduct a feasibility study for robustly accessing the effect of multiple interventions to control the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, peaks and lengths of COVID-19 breakouts in the UK and other European countries, accounting for balance of healthcare demand.

MethodsWe developed a model to attempt to infer the impact of mitigation, suppression and multiple rolling interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK. Our model assumed that each intervention has equivalent effect on the reproduction number R across countries and over time; where its intensity was presented by average-number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals; early immediate intensive intervention led to increased health need and social anxiety. We considered two important features: direct link between Exposed and Recovered population, and practical healthcare demand by separation of infections into mild, moderate and critical cases. Our model was fitted and calibrated with date on cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan to estimate how suppression intervention impacted on the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths over time during January 2020, and April 2020. We combined the calibrated model with data on the cases of COVID-19 in London and non-London regions in the UK during February 2020 and April 2020 to estimate the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, and healthcare demand by using multiple interventions. We applied the calibrated model to the prediction of infection and healthcare resource changes in other 6 European countries based on actual measures they have implemented during this period.

FindingsWe estimated given that 1) By the date (5th March 2020) of the first report death in the UK, around 7499 people would have already been infected with the virus. After taking suppression on 23rd March, the peak of infection in the UK would have occurred between 28th March and 4th April 2020; the peak of death would have occurred between 18th April and 24th April 2020. 2) By 29th April, no significant collapse of health system in the UK have occurred, where there have been sufficient hospital beds for severe and critical cases. But in the Europe, Italy, Spain and France have experienced a 3 weeks period of shortage of hospital beds for severe and critical cases, leading to many deaths outside hospitals. 3) One optimal strategy to control COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK is to take region-level specific intervention. If taking suppression with very high intensity in London from 23rd March 2020 for 100 days, and 3 weeks rolling intervention between very high intensity and high intensity in non-London regions. The total infections and deaths in the UK were limited to 9.3 million and 143 thousand; the peak time of healthcare demand was due to the 96th day (12th May, 2020), where it needs hospital beds for 68.9 thousand severe and critical cases. 4) If taking a simultaneous 3 weeks rolling intervention between very high intensity and high intensity in all regions of the UK, the total infections and deaths increased slightly to 10 million and 154 thousand; the peak time of healthcare occurs at the 97th day (13th May, 2020), where it needs equivalent hospital beds for severe and critical cases of 73.5 thousand. 5) If too early releasing intervention intensity above moderate level and simultaneously implemented them in all regions of the UK, there would be a risk of second wave, where the total infections and deaths in the UK possibly reached to 23.4 million and 897 thousand.

InterpretationConsidering social and economic costs in controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, long-term suppression is not economically viable. Our finding suggests that rolling intervention is an optimal strategy to effectively and efficiently control COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK and potential other countries for balancing healthcare demand and morality ratio. As for huge difference of population density and social distancing between different regions in the UK, it is more appropriate to implement regional level specific intervention with varied intensities and maintenance periods. We suggest an intervention strategy to the UK that take a consistent suppression in London for 100 days and 3 weeks rolling intervention in other regions. This strategy would reduce the overall infections and deaths of COVID-19 outbreaks, and balance healthcare demand in the UK.","Yang, P.; Qi, J.; Zhang, S.; Bi, G.; Wang, X.; Yang, Y.; Sheng, B.; Mao, X.",2020-05-26,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.19.20107326,1,Po Yang,The University of Sheffield,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20107326v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20107326v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1038/s41598-021-82170-y

18608,Biostatistical Investigation of Correlation Between COVID-19 and Diabetes Mellitus,"COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease. Studies suggest that its severity is amplified in patients diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus. In this study, the correlation between the prevalence of COVID-19 and Diabetes was analyzed at the regional and global scale using data extracted from WHO and IDF Diabetes Atlas. For the regional investigation data was assorted into ten regions including Central Asia, Middle east and western Asia, Africa, North America and the Caribbean, South east Asia, East Asia, Europe, South and Central America, South Asia and Oceania. The results show a positive correlation coefficient of 0.47 in Middle east and western Asia. While at the global scale analysis all the selected countries were considered together and a correlation coefficient of 0.32 was observed. This number was increased to 0.69 when the top most affected countries by COVID-19 were considered for the analysis. In order to investigate the time dependent relationship of the two diseases, the data was analysed in five windows of 45 days each since the beginning of pandemic. The results show an increasing pattern of the correlation coefficient in the last three windows. Overall, based on this study by increasing the prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus, the prevalence of COVID-19 cases may also increase.","Eynizadeh, Z.; Ameli, Z.; Sahranavard, M.; Daneshparvar, M.; Abdollahi Dolagh, M.; Roozkhosh, M.; Ejtehadi, M.

21285,"Integrating Operant and Cognitive Behavioral Economics to Inform Infectious Disease Response: Prevention, Testing, and Vaccination in the COVID-19 Pandemic","The role of human behavior to thwart transmission of infectious diseases like COVID-19 is evident. Yet, many areas of psychological and behavioral science are limited in the ability to mobilize to address exponential spread or provide easily translatable findings for policymakers. Here we describe how integrating methods from operant and cognitive approaches to behavioral economics can provide robust policy relevant data. Adapting well validated methods from behavioral economic discounting and demand frameworks, we evaluate in four crowdsourced samples (total N = 1,366) behavioral mechanisms underlying engagement in preventive health behaviors. We find that people are more likely to social distance when specified activities are framed as high risk, that describing delay until testing (rather than delay until results) increases testing likelihood, and that framing vaccine safety in a positive valence improves vaccine acceptance. These findings collectively emphasize the flexibility of methods from diverse areas of behavioral science for informing public health crisis management.","Strickland, J. C.; Reed, D. D.; Hursh, S.

21634,Socioeconomic Disparities and COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptance: Experience from Israel,"COVID-19 vaccination acceptance has a key role in mitigating the pandemic. Concern has been raised that vaccination rates will be limited in demographically defined areas of lower income. Israels rapid vaccination campaign may allow to assess these assumptions in real-world and to devise tools for effectively focusing the vaccination efforts. We analyzed the correlation between COVID-19 vaccination rates, socioeconomic status (SES) and active COVID-19 disease burden. We carried out a nationwide study, based on data provided by Ministry of Health of COVID-19 vaccination rates in all municipalities in Israel up to January 12th, 2021. Municipal Vaccination rates of population older than 60 significantly correlated with the socioeconomic status (r=0.83, 95% confidence interval [0.79 to 0.87]). Finally, we established a novel metric for focusing the vaccination efforts based on % vaccinations and active disease burden. In Israel, a case-model country for COVD-19 vaccinations, vaccination rates were strongly correlated with SES. The study findings demonstrate the need to directly target vaccination acceptance to socio-economically disadvantaged populations and suggest potential tools for policymakers to focus their efforts.","Caspi, G.; Dayan, A.; Eshal, Y.; Taub, S.

6227,Evaluating growth pattern and assessing future scenario of COVID-19 epidemic of India,"COVID-19 the modern pandemic has spread across the world at a rapid pace. SARS-CoV 2 is highly transmissible and the rate of infection is exponential for heavily infected countries. Asymptotic carriers and longer incubation period have been key towards such a large-scale distribution of disease. Data released by official authorities on COVID-19 cases is significantly affected by various factors such as size of sample, incubation period of disease and time taken to test the sample. These factors mask the useful pattern (signal) of disease spread. Thus, an ingenious method to group data into cycles of five and seven days, for studying pattern of disease spread is undertaken. Occurrence of recurrent peaks as indicated by Adjusted Rate of infection per day indicated the spread of disease has been non-uniform. Currently, India is yet to reach the critical point (peak of epidemic) with adjusted daily cases more than 1000. Increasing testing capacity along with random sampling and sample pooling can help in preventing formation of these peaks in future. The proposed method helps in assessing the current state and for predicting future scenarios epidemics.","Patil, N. L.; Gangavati, L.

14665,COVID-19 Preprints and Their Publishing Rate: An Improved Method,"ContextAs the COVID-19 pandemic persists around the world, the scientific community continues to produce and circulate knowledge on the deadly disease at an unprecedented rate. During the early stage of the pandemic, preprints represented nearly 40% of all English-language COVID-19 scientific corpus (6, 000+ preprints | 16, 000+ articles). As of mid-August 2020, that proportion dropped to around 28% (13, 000+ preprints | 49, 000+ articles). Nevertheless, preprint servers remain a key engine in the efficient dissemination of scientific work on this infectious disease. But, giving the  uncertified nature of the scientific manuscripts curated on preprint repositories, their integration to the global ecosystem of scientific communication is not without creating serious tensions. This is especially the case for biomedical knowledge since the dissemination of bad science can have widespread societal consequences.

ScopeIn this paper, I propose a robust method that will allow the repeated monitoring and measuring of COVID-19 preprints publication rate. I also introduce a new API called Upload-or-Perish. It is a micro-API service that enables a client to query a specific preprint manuscripts publication status and associated meta-data using a unique ID. This tool is in active development.

DataI use Covid-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) to calculate COVID-19 preprint corpus conversion rate to peer-reviewed articles. CORD-19 dataset includes preprints from arXiv, bioRxiv, and medRxiv.

MethodsI utilize conditional fuzzy logic on article titles to determine if a preprint has a published counterpart version in the database. My approach is an important departure from previous studies that rely exclusively on bioRxiv API to ascertain preprints publication status. This is problematic since the level of false positives in bioRxiv metadata could be as high as 37%.

FindingsMy analysis reveals that around 15% of COVID-19 preprint manuscripts in CORD-19 dataset that were uploaded on from arXiv, bioRxiv, and medRxiv between January and early August 2020 were published in a peer-reviewed venue. When compared to the most recent measure available, this represents a two-fold increase in a period of two months.

8816,The impact of the undetected COVID-19 cases on its transmission dynamics,"ObjectiveThe COVID-19 pandemic is currently ongoing. Presently, due to the unavailability of a definitive vaccine to decrease its acquiring, its essential to understand its transmissibility in the community by undetected cases to control its transmission. This study aims to study this context using mathematical modelling.

MethodsA COVID-19 transmission model was framed that estimated the basic reproduction number (R0, a measurement of disease risk) using the next-generation method. It explored the contribution of exposed and infected (detected and undetected) individuals, and environmental pathogen to the overall risk of infection spreading, utilizing the publicly reported data of this infection in Maharashtra between March 22, 2020, and May 4, 2020. A sensitivity analysis was performed to study the effect of a rising number of undetected cases to R0.

ResultsThe estimated basic reproduction number is R0 = 4.63, which increases rapidly with the rise in the undetected COVID-19 cases. Although the exposed individuals made the largest contribution to infection transmission (R1 = 2.42), the contaminated environment also played a significant role.

ConclusionsIt is crucial to identify the individuals exposed and infected to COVID-19 disease and isolate them to control its transmission. The awareness of the role of fomites in infection transmission is also important in this regard.","Saha, S.; Saha, S.",2020-06-03,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.30.20117838,1,Sujata Saha,Mankar College,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.30.20117838v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.30.20117838v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA

19115,Prediction of Covid-19 spreading and optimal coordination of counter-measures: From microscopic to macroscopic models to Pareto fronts,"The Covid-19 disease has caused a world-wide pandemic with more than 60 million positive cases and more than 1.4 million deaths by the end of November 2020. As long as effective medical treatment and vaccination are not available, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, self-isolation and quarantine as well as far-reaching shutdowns of economic activity and public life are the only available strategies to prevent the virus from spreading. These interventions must meet conflicting requirements where some objectives, like the minimization of disease-related deaths or the impact on health systems, demand for stronger counter-measures, while others, such as social and economic costs, call for weaker counter-measures. Therefore, finding the optimal compromise of counter-measures requires the solution of a multi-objective optimization problem that is based on accurate prediction of future infection spreading for all combinations of counter-measures under consideration. We present a strategy for construction and solution of such a multi-objective optimization problem with real-world applicability. The strategy is based on a micro-model allowing for accurate prediction via a realistic combination of person-centric data-driven human mobility and behavior, stochastic infection models and disease progression models including micro-level inclusion of governmental intervention strategies. For this micro-model, a surrogate macro-model is constructed and validated that is much less computationally expensive and can therefore be used in the core of a numerical solver for the multi-objective optimization problem. The resulting set of optimal compromises between counter-measures (Pareto front) is discussed and its meaning for policy decisions is outlined.","Wulkow, H.; Conrad, T.; Djurdjevac Conrad, N.; Mueller, S.

10296,Serologic cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 with endemic and seasonal Betacoronaviruses,"In order to properly understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of humoral immunity, researchers have evaluated the presence of serum antibodies of people worldwide experiencing the pandemic. These studies rely on the use of recombinant proteins from the viral genome in order to identify serum antibodies that recognize SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Here, we discuss the cross-reactivity potential of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with the full spike proteins of four other Betacoronaviruses that cause disease in humans, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), we detected the potential cross-reactivity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 towards the four other coronaviruses, with the strongest cross-recognition between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS /MERS-CoV antibodies, as expected based on sequence homology of their respective spike proteins. Further analysis of cross-reactivity could provide informative data that could lead to intelligently designed pan-coronavirus therapeutics or vaccines.","Hicks, J.; Klumpp-Thomas, C.; Kalish, H.; Shunmugavel, A.; Mehalko, J.; Denson, J.-P.; Snead, K.; Drew, M.; Corbett, K.; Graham, B.; Hall, M.

21710,COVID-19 spread and Weather in U.S. states: a cross-correlative study on summer-autumn 2020.,"An effect of weather on sars-cov-2 transmission is regularly proposed as a putative cause of unexplained fluctuations of covid-19 new cases, but clear data supporting this hypothesis remains to be presented. Here I measured longitudinal time-series correlations between outdoor temperature, humidity and covid-19 reproduction number (Rt) in the 50 U.S. states (+DC). In order to mitigate the confounding influence of varying social restriction measures, the analysis spans a 5-month period during summer and autumn 2020 when restrictions were comparatively lower and more stable. I used a cross-covariance approach to account for a variable delay between infection and case report. For a delay near 11 days, most U.S. states exhibited a negative correlation between outdoor temperature and Rt, as well as between absolute humidity and Rt (mean r = -0.35). In 21 states, the correlation was strong (r < -0.5). Individual state data are presented, and associations between cold and/or dry weather episodes and short-term new case surges are proposed. After identifying potential confounding factors, I discuss 3 possible causal mechanisms that could explain a correlation between outdoor weather and indoor disease transmission: behavioral adaptations to cold weather, respiratory tract temperature, and the importing of outdoor absolute humidity to indoor spaces.","De Margerie, E.",2021-02-01,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.01.29.21250793,1,Emmanuel De Margerie,CNRS,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.29.21250793v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.29.21250793v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
15870,A steady trickle-down from metro districts and improving epidemic-parameters characterized the increasing COVID-19 cases in India,"BackgroundBy mid-September of 2020, the number of daily new infections in India crossed 95, 000. We aimed to characterize the spatio-temporal shifts in the disease burden as the infections rose during the first wave of COVID-19.

MethodsWe gathered the publicly available district-level (equivalent of counties) granular data for the 15 April to 31 August 2020 period. We used the epidemiological data from 186 districts with the highest case burden as of August 31, 559, 566 active cases and 2, 715, 656 cumulative infections, and the governing epidemic parameters were estimated by fitting it to a susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-recovered-dead (SAIRD) model. The space-time trends in the case burden and epidemic parameters were analyzed. When the physical proximity of the districts did not explain the spreading patterns, we developed a metric for accessibility of the districts via air and train travel. The districts were categorized as large metro, metro, urban and sub-urban and the spatial shifts in case burden were analyzed.

ResultsThe center of the burden of the current-active infections which on May 15 was in the large metro districts with easy international access shifted continuously and smoothly towards districts which could be accessed by domestic airports and by trains. A linear trend-analysis showed a continuous improvement in the governing epidemic parameters consistently across the four categories of districts. The reproduction numbers improved from 1.77 {+/-} 0.58 on May 15 to 1.07 {+/-} 0.13 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.0001053); and from 1.58 {+/-} 0.39 on May 15 to 0.94 {+/-} 0.11 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.0067). The recovery rate per infected person per day improved from 0.0581 {+/-} 0.009 on May 15 to 0.091 {+/-} 0.010 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.26 x 10-12); and from 0.059 {+/-} 0.011 on May 15 to 0.100 {+/-} 0.010 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.12 x 10-16). The death rate of symptomatic individuals which includes the case-fatality-rate as well as the time from symptoms to death, consistently decreased from 0.0025 {+/-} 0.0014 on May 15 to 0.0013 {+/-} 0.0003 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.0010); and from 0.0018 {+/-} 0.0008 on May 15 to 0.0014 {+/-} 0.0003 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.2789).

ConclusionsAs the daily infections continued to rise at a national level, the """"center"""" of the pandemic-burden shifted smoothly and predictably towards smaller sized districts in a clear hierarchical fashion of accessibility from an international travel perspective. This observed trend was meant to serve as an alert to re-organize healthcare resources towards remote districts. The geographical spreading patterns continue to be relevant as the second wave of infections began in March 2021 with a center in the mid-range districts.

13610,A data-driven epidemiological model to explain the Covid-19 pandemic in multiple countries and help in choosing mitigation strategies,"Accurate models are fundamental to understand the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate different mitigation strategies. Here, we present a multi-compartmental model that fits the epidemiological data for eleven countries, despite the reduced number of fitting parameters. This model consistently explains the data for the daily infected, recovered, and dead over the first six months of the pandemic. The good quality of the fits makes it possible to explore different scenarios and evaluate the impact of both individual and collective behaviors and government-level decisions to mitigate the epidemic. We identify robust alternatives to lockdown, such as self-protection measures, and massive testing. Furthermore, communication and risk perception are fundamental to modulate the success of different strategies. The fitting/simulation tool is publicly available for use and test of other models, allowing for comparisons between different underlying assumptions, mitigation measures, and policy recommendations.","Beira, M.

Herein, we retrospect clinical features, outcomes and ARDS characteristics of 75 intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 in Chongqing, China. We found a 5.3% case fatality rate of the ICU patients in Chongqing. 93% patients developed ARDS during the intensive care, and more than half were moderate. However, most of the patients (55%) supported with high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy, but not mechanical ventilation. Nearly one third of patients with ARDS got an early improvement (eiARDS), and the rate is much higher than the other causes of ARDS in a previous study. Patients with eiARDS had a higher survival rate and lower length of ICU stay. The age (< 55 years) is an independent predictor for the eiARDS, and stratification of COVID-19 patients by age is recommended.","Zhan, Z.; Yang, X.; Du, H.; Zhang, C.; Song, Y.; Ran, X.; Zhang, A.; Yang, M.",2020-07-16,Intensive Care And Critical Care Medicine,10.1101/2020.07.15.20154047,1,An Zhang,The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154047v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154047v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.2196/24843

17901,Non applicability of validated predictive models for intensive care admission and death of COVID-19 patients in a secondary care hospital in Belgium,"ObjectiveTo set up simple and reliable predictive scores for intensive care admissions and deaths in COVID-19 patients. These scores adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guidelines.

DesignMonocentric retrospective cohort study run from early March to end of May in Clinique Saint-Pierre Ottignies, a secondary care hospital located in Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. The outcomes of the study are (i) admission in the Intensive Care Unit and (ii) death.

Data sourcesAll patients admitted in the Emergency Department with a positive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test were included in the study. Routine clinical and laboratory data were collected at their admission and during their stay. Chest X-Rays and CT-Scans were performed and analyzed by a senior radiologist.

MethodsA recently published predictive score conducted on a large scale was used as a benchmark value (Liang score)1. Logistic regressions were used to develop predictive scores for (i) admission to ICU among emergency ward patients; (ii) death among ICU patients on 40 clinical variables. These models were based on medical intuition and simple model selection tools. Their predictive capabilities were then compared to Liang score.

ResultsOur results suggest that Liang score may not provide reliable guidance for ICU admission and death. Moreover, the performance of this approach is clearly outperformed by models based on simple markers. For example, a logistic regression considering only the LDH yields to similar sensitivity and greater specificity. Finally, all models considered in this study lead to levels of specificity under or equal to 50%.

ConclusionsIn our experience, the results of a predictive score based on a large-scale Chinese study cannot be applied in the Belgian population. However, in our small cohort it appears that LDH above 579 UI/L and venous lactate above 3.02 mmol/l may be considered as good predictive biological factors for ICU admission. With regards to death risk, NLR above 22.1, tobacco abuse status and 80 % of respiratory impairment appears to be relevant predictive factors. A predictive score for admission to ICU or death is desperately needed in secondary hospitals. Optimal allocation of resources guided by evidence-based indicators will best guide patients at time of admission and avoid futile treatments in intensive care units.","Parisi, N.; Mili, N.",2020-11-09,Intensive Care And Critical Care Medicine,10.1101/2020.11.06.20205799,1,Nabil Mili,University of Lausanne,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.06.20205799v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.06.20205799v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
5362,Resilient SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics workflows including viral heat inactivation,"There is a worldwide need for reagents to perform SARS-CoV-2 detection. Some laboratories have implemented kit-free protocols, but many others do not have the capacity to develop these and/or perform manual processing. We provide multiple workflows for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection in clinical samples by comparing several commercially available RNA extraction methods: QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAgen), RNAdvance Blood/Viral (Beckman) and Mag-Bind Viral DNA/RNA 96 Kit (Omega Bio-tek). We also compared One-step RT-qPCR reagents: TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (FastVirus, ThermoFisher Scientific), qPCRBIO Probe 1-Step Go Lo-ROX (PCR Biosystems) and Luna(R) Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (Luna, NEB). We used primer-probes that detect viral N (EUA CDC) and RdRP (PHE guidelines). All RNA extraction methods provided similar results. FastVirus and Luna proved most sensitive. N detection was more reliable than that of RdRP, particularly in samples with low viral titres. Importantly, we demonstrate that treatment of nasopharyngeal swabs with 70 degrees for 10 or 30 min, or 90 degrees for 10 or 30 min (both original variant and B 1.1.7) inactivates SARS-CoV-2 employing plaque assays, and that it has minimal impact on the sensitivity of the qPCR in clinical samples.

5038,Clinical Characteristics of Hospitalized Covid-19 Patients in New York City,"BackgroundThe coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic is a global public health crisis, with over 1.6 million cases and 95,000 deaths worldwide. Data are needed regarding the clinical course of hospitalized patients, particularly in the United States.

MethodsDemographic, clinical, and outcomes data for patients admitted to five Mount Sinai Health System hospitals with confirmed Covid-19 between February 27 and April 2, 2020 were identified through institutional electronic health records. We conducted a descriptive study of patients who had in-hospital mortality or were discharged alive.

ResultsA total of 2,199 patients with Covid-19 were hospitalized during the study period. As of April 2nd, 1,121 (51%) patients remained hospitalized, and 1,078 (49%) completed their hospital course. Of the latter, the overall mortality was 29%, and 36% required intensive care. The median age was 65 years overall and 75 years in those who died. Pre-existing conditions were present in 65% of those who died and 46% of those discharged. In those who died, the admission median lymphocyte percentage was 11.7%, D-dimer was 2.4 ug/ml, C-reactive protein was 162 mg/L, and procalcitonin was 0.44 ng/mL. In those discharged, the admission median lymphocyte percentage was 16.6%, D-dimer was 0.93 ug/ml, C-reactive protein was 79 mg/L, and procalcitonin was 0.09 ng/mL.

ConclusionsThis is the largest and most diverse case series of hospitalized patients with Covid-19 in the United States to date. Requirement of intensive care and mortality were high.

12818,Effectiveness of Convalescent Plasma for Treatment of COVID-19 Patients,"Background and objectiveThe outbreak of COVID-19 has become a global health concern. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma therapy in patients with severe and critically ill COVID-19.

MethodsSixteen COVID-19 patients received transfusion of anti-COVID-19 antibody-positive convalescent plasma. The main outcome was time for viral nucleic acid amplification (NAA) test turning negative. Clinical laboratory parameters were measured at the baseline (d0) before plasma transfusion, and day 1 (d1), day 3 (d3) after transfusion as well.

ResultsAmong the 16 patients, 10 of them had a consistently positive result of viral NAA test before convalescent plasma transfusion. Eight patients (8/10) became negative from day 2 to day 8 after transfusion. Severe patients showed a shorter time for NAA test turning negative after transfusion (mean rank 2.17 vs 5{middle dot}90, P = 0.036). Two critically ill patients transfused plasma with lower antibody level remained a positive result of NAA test. CRP level demonstrated a decline 1 day after convalescent plasma treatment, compared with the baseline (P = 0.017). No adverse events were observed during convalescent plasma transfusion.

ConclusionsViral NAA test of most patients with COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma transfusion turned negative on the 2nd to 8th days after transfusion, and the negative time of severe patients was shorter than that of critically ill patients.

We present relationships of age, sex, and nationality to presenting symptoms.

MethodsInternational, prospective observational study of 60109 hospitalized symptomatic patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 recruited from 43 countries between 30 January and 3 August 2020. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate relationships of age and sex to published COVID-19 case definitions and the most commonly reported symptoms.

Results Typical symptoms of fever (69%), cough (68%) and shortness of breath (66%) were the most commonly reported. 92% of patients experienced at least one of these. Prevalence of typical symptoms was greatest in 30-to 60-year-olds (respectively 80%, 79%, 69%; at least one 95%). They were reported less frequently in children ([&le;]18 years: 69%, 48%, 23%; 85%), older adults ([&ge;]70 years: 61%, 62%, 65%; 90%), and women (66%, 66%, 64%; 90%; vs men 71%, 70%, 67%; 93%). The most common atypical presentation under 60 years of age was nausea and vomiting, and over 60 years was confusion. Regression models showed significant differences in symptoms with sex, age and country.

InterpretationAdults over 60 and children admitted to hospital with COVID-19 are less likely to present with typical symptoms. Nausea and vomiting are common atypical presentations under 30 years. Confusion is a frequent atypical presentation of COVID-19 in adults over 60 years. Women are less likely to experience typical symptoms than men.

6639,Who can go back to work when the COVID-19 pandemic remits?,"This paper seeks to determine which workers affected by lockdown measures can return to work when a government decides to apply lockdown exit strategies. This system, which we call Sequential Selective Multidimensional Decision (SSMD), involves deciding sequentially, by geographical areas, sectors of activity, age groups and immunity, which workers can return to work at a given time according to the epidemiological criteria of the country as well as that of a group of reference countries, used as a benchmark, that have suffered a lower level of lockdown de-escalation strategies. We apply SSMD to Spain, based on affiliation to the Social Security system prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and conclude that 98.37% of the population could be affected.

13261,Underdetection of COVID-19 cases in France in the exit phase following lockdown,"A novel testing policy was implemented in May in France to systematically screen potential COVID-19 infections and suppress local outbreaks while lifting lockdown restrictions. 20,736 virologically-confirmed cases were reported in mainland France from May 13, 2020 (week 20, end of lockdown) to June 28 (week 26). Accounting for missing data and the delay from symptom onset to confirmation test, this corresponds to 7,258 [95% CI 7,160-7,336] cases with symptom onset during this period, a likely underestimation of the real number. Using age-stratified transmission models parameterized to behavioral data and calibrated to regional hospital admissions, we estimated that 69,115 [58,072-77,449] COVID-19 symptomatic cases occurred, suggesting that 9 out of 10 cases with symptoms were not ascertained. Median detection rate increased from 7% [6-9]% to 31% [28-35]% over time, with regional estimates varying from 11% (Grand Est) to 78% (Normandy) by the end of June. Healthcare-seeking behavior in COVID-19 suspect cases remained low (31%) throughout the period. Model projections for the incidence of symptomatic cases (4.5 [3.9-5.0] per 100,000) were compatible with estimates integrating participatory and virological surveillance data, assuming all suspect cases consulted. Encouraging healthcare-seeking behavior and awareness in suspect cases is critical to improve detection. Substantially more aggressive and efficient testing with easier access is required to act as a pandemic-fighting tool. These elements should be considered in light of the currently observed resurgence of cases in France and other European countries.","Pullano, G.; Di Domenico, L.; Sabbatini, C.

20562,"Construction of a demand and capacity model for intensive care and hospital ward beds, and mortality from COVID-19","BackgroundThis paper describes the construction of a model used to estimate the number of excess deaths that could be expected as a direct consequence of a lack of hospital bed and intensive care unit (ICU) capacity.

MethodsA series of compartmental models was used to estimate the number of deaths under different combinations of care required (ICU or ward), and care received (ICU, ward or no care) in England up to the end of April 2021. Model parameters were sourced from publicly available government information, organisations collating COVID-19 data and calculations using existing parameters. A compartmental sub-model was used to estimate the mortality scalars that represent the increase in mortality that would be expected from a lack of provision of an ICU or general ward bed when one is required. Three illustrative scenarios for admissions numbers,  Optimistic,  Middling and  Pessimistic, are described showing how the model can be used to estimate mortality rates under different scenarios of capacity.

ResultsThe key output of our collaboration was the model itself rather than the results of any of the scenarios. The model allows a user to understand the excess mortality impact arising as a direct consequence of capacity being breached under various scenarios or forecasts of hospital admissions. The scenarios described in this paper are illustrative and are not forecasts.

There were no excess deaths from a lack of capacity in any of the  Optimistic scenario applications in sensitivity analysis.

Several of the  Middling scenario applications under sensitivity testing resulted in excess deaths directly attributable to a lack of capacity. Most excess deaths arose when we modelled a 20% reduction compared to best estimate ICU capacity. This led to 597 deaths (0.7% increase).

All the  Pessimistic scenario applications under sensitivity analysis had excess deaths. These ranged from 49,219 (19.4% increase) when we modelled a 20% increase in ward bed availability over the best-estimate, to 103,845 (40.9% increase) when we modelled a 20% shortfall in ward bed availability below the best-estimate. The emergence of a new, more transmissible variant (VOC 202012/01) increases the likelihood of real world outcomes at, or beyond, those modelled in our  Pessimistic scenario.

The results can be explained by considering how capacity evolves in each of the scenarios. In the Middling scenario, whilst ICU capacity may be approached and even possibly breached, there remains sufficient ward capacity to take lives who need either ward or ICU support, keeping excess deaths relatively low. However, the Pessimistic scenario sees ward capacity breached, and in many scenarios for a period of several weeks, resulting in much higher mortality in those lives who require care but do not receive it.

ConclusionsNo excess deaths from breaching capacity would be expected under the unadjusted  Optimistic assumptions of demand. The  Middling scenario could result in some excess deaths from breaching capacity, though these would be small (0.7% increase) relative to the total number of deaths in that scenario. The  Pessimistic scenario would certainly result in significant excess deaths from breaching capacity. Our sensitivity analysis indicated a range between 49,219 (19.4% increase) and 103,845 (40.9% increase) excess deaths.

Without the new variant, exceeding capacity for hospital and ICU beds did not appear to be the most likely outcome but given the new variant it now appears more plausible and, if so, would result in a substantial increase in the number of deaths from COVID-19.","Mcdonald, S.; Martin, C.

7063,"Time is of the essence: impact of delays on effectiveness of contact tracing for COVID-19, a modelling study","BackgroundWith confirmed cases of COVID-19 declining in many countries, lockdown measures are gradually being lifted. However, even if most social distancing measures are continued, other public health measures will be needed to control the epidemic. Contact tracing via conventional methods or mobile app technology is central to control strategies during deescalation of social distancing. We aimed to identify key factors for a contact tracing strategy (CTS) to be successful.

MethodsWe evaluated the impact of timeliness and completeness in various steps of a CTS using a stochastic mathematical model with explicit time delays between time of infection and symptom onset, and between symptom onset, diagnosis by testing, and isolation (testing delay). The model also includes tracing of close contacts (e.g. household members) and casual contacts, followed by testing regardless of symptoms and isolation if positive, with different delays (tracing delay) and coverages (tracing coverage). We computed effective reproduction numbers of a CTS (Rcts) for a population with social distancing measures and various scenarios for isolation of index cases and tracing and quarantine of its contacts.

FindingsFor the best-case scenario (testing and tracing delays of 0 days and tracing coverage of 80%), and assuming that around 40% of transmission occur before symptom onset, the model predicts that the effective reproduction number of 1.2 (with social distancing only) will be reduced to 0.8 by adding contact tracing. A testing delay of 2 days requires tracing delay to be at most 1 day, or tracing coverage to be at least 80% to keep Rcts below 1. With a testing/isolation delay of 3 days, even the most efficient CTS cannot reach Rcts values below 1. The effect of minimizing tracing delay (e.g., with app-based technology) declines with decreasing coverage of app use, but app-based tracing alone remains more effective than conventional tracing alone even with 20% coverage. The proportion of transmissions per index case that can be prevented depends on testing and tracing delays, and ranges from up to 80% in the best-case scenario (testing and tracing delays of 0 days) to 42% with a 3-day testing delay and 18% with a 5-day testing delay.

InterpretationIn our model, minimizing testing delay had the largest impact on reducing onward transmissions. Optimizing testing and tracing coverage and minimizing tracing delays, for instance with app-based technology, further enhanced CTS effectiveness, with a potential to prevent up to 80% of all transmissions. Access to testing should therefore be optimized, and mobile app technology may reduce delays in the CTS process and optimize contact tracing coverage.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed, bioRxiv, and medRxiv for articles published in English from January 1, 2020, to June 20, 2020, with the following keywords: (""""2019-nCoV"""" OR """"novel coronavirus"""" OR """"COVID-19"""" OR """"SARS-CoV-2"""") AND """"contact tracing"""" AND """"model*"""". Population-level modelling studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have suggested that isolation and tracing alone might not be sufficient to control outbreaks and additional measures might be required. However, few studies have focused on the effects of lifting individual measures once the first wave of the epidemic has been controlled. Lifting measures must be accompanied by effective contact tracing strategies (CTS) in order to keep the effective reproduction number below 1. A detailed analysis, with special emphasis on the effects of time delays in testing of index patients and tracing of contacts, has not been done.

Added value of this studyWe performed a systematic analysis of the various steps required in the process of testing and diagnosing an index case as well as tracing and isolating possible secondary cases of the index case. We then used a stochastic transmission model which makes a distinction between close contacts (e.g. household members) and casual contacts to assess which steps and (possible) delays are crucial in determining the effectiveness of CTS. We evaluated how delays and the level of contact tracing coverage influence the effective reproduction number, and how fast CTS needs to be to keep the reproduction number below 1. We also analyzed what proportion of onward transmission can be prevented for short delays and high contact tracing coverage. Assuming that around 40% of transmission occurs before symptom onset, we found that keeping the time between symptom onset and testing and isolation of an index case short (<3 days) is imperative for a successful CTS. This implies that the process leading from symptom onset to receiving a positive test should be minimized by providing sufficient and easily accessible testing facilities. In addition, reducing contact-tracing delays also helps to keep the reproduction number below 1.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur analyses highlight that CTS will only contribute to containment of COVID-19 if it can be organised in a way that time delays in the process from symptom onset to isolation of the index case and his/her contacts are very short. The process of conventional contact tracing should be reviewed and streamlined, while mobile app technology may offer a tool for gaining speed in the process. Reducing delay in testing subjects for SARS-CoV-2 should be a key objective of CTS.","Kretzschmar, M. E.; Rozhnova, G.; Bootsma, M.; Van Boven, M.

7449,Clinical evaluation of IFN beta1b in COVID-19 pneumonia: a retrospective study,"BackgroundCOVID-19 pneumonia is associated with significant mortality and has no approved antiviral therapy. Interferon beta1 has shown in vitro studies a potent inhibition of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In an in vitro study, SARS-CoV-2 had more sensitivity to IFN-I pretreatment that SARS-CoV. A combination of IFN beta1b administered subcutaneously with other antiviral treatments has been recommended in several guidelines. However, clinical trial results for the treatment of COVID-19 are pending. We aimed to assess the efficiency of IFN beta1b in COVID19 comparing the in-hospital mortality between patients who received IFN beta1b and patients did not receive.

MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, we included hospitalized adults with COVID-19 between February 23th and April 4th, 2020, at the Central Defense Hospital (Madrid, Spain). Subcutaneous interferon beta-1b was recommended in moderate-severe pneumonia. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify variables associated with in-hospital mortality.

FindingsWe analyzed 256 patients (106 patients in interferon group and 150 patients in control group). At admission, patients who did not receive interferon beta1b presented a greater number of comorbidities. The overall mortality rate was 24.6% (63/256). Twenty-two patients (20.8%) in the interferon group died and 41 (27.3%) in the control group (p=0.229). In the multivariate analysis, the predictors of in-hospital mortality were age, severity of clinical picture at admission and hydroxychloroquine treatment.

InterpretationIn hospitalized patients with COVID-19, interferon beta1b treatment was not associated to decrease in-hospital mortality. Further assessment of the earlier administration of this drug in randomized trials is recommended.

Fundingnone.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Pubmed on April 27th, 2020, for articles evaluating the efficacy of interferon beta in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using the terms: """"interferon beta and (COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2)"""".

5873,Enhanced Contact Investigations for Nine Early Travel-Related Cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, China and has since become pandemic. As part of initial response activities in the United States, enhanced contact investigations were conducted to enable early identification and isolation of additional cases and to learn more about risk factors for transmission.

MethodsClose contacts of nine early travel-related cases in the United States were identified. Close contacts meeting criteria for active monitoring were followed, and selected individuals were targeted for collection of additional exposure details and respiratory samples. Respiratory samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

ResultsThere were 404 close contacts who underwent active monitoring in the response jurisdictions; 338 had at least basic exposure data, of whom 159 had [&ge;]1 set of respiratory samples collected and tested. Across all known close contacts under monitoring, two additional cases were identified; both secondary cases were in spouses of travel-associated case patients. The secondary attack rate among household members, all of whom had [&ge;]1 respiratory sample tested, was 13% (95% CI: 4 - 38%).

ConclusionsThe enhanced contact tracing investigations undertaken around nine early travel-related cases of COVID-19 in the United States identified two cases of secondary transmission, both spouses. Rapid detection and isolation of the travel-associated case patients, enabled by public awareness of COVID-19 among travelers from China, may have mitigated transmission risk among close contacts of these cases.","Burke, R.

11746,Clinical characteristics of children and young people hospitalised with covid-19 in the United Kingdom: prospective multicentre observational cohort study,"ObjectiveTo characterise the clinical features of children and young people admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the UK, and explore factors associated with admission to critical care, mortality, and development of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adolescents temporarily related to covid-19 (MIS-C).

DesignProspective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real time analysis.

Setting260 acute care hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland between 17th January and 5th June 2020, with a minimal follow-up time of two weeks (to 19th June 2020).

Participants451 children and young people aged less than 19 years admitted to 116 hospitals and enrolled into the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emergency Infections Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK study with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2.

Main Outcome MeasuresAdmission to critical care (high dependency or intensive care), in-hospital mortality, or meeting the WHO preliminary case definition for MIS-C.

ResultsMedian age was 3.9 years [interquartile range (IQR) 0.3-12.9 years], 36% (162/451) were under 12 months old, and 57% (256/450) were male. 56% (224/401) were White, 12% (49/401) South Asian and 10% (40/401) Black. 43% (195/451) had at least one recorded comorbidity. A muco-enteric cluster of symptoms was identified, closely mirroring the WHO MIS-C criteria.

17% of children (72/431) were admitted to critical care. On multivariable analysis this was associated with age under one month odds ratio 5.05 (95% confidence interval 1.69 to 15.72, p=0.004), age 10 to 14 years OR 3.11 (1.21 to 8.55, p=0.022) and Black ethnicity OR 3.02 (1.30 to 6.84, p=0.008). Three young people died (0.7 %, 3/451) aged 16 to 19 years, all of whom had profound comorbidity.

Twelve percent of children (36/303) met the WHO MIS-C criteria, with the first patient developing symptoms in mid-March. Those meeting MIS-C criteria were older, (median age 10.8 years ([IQR 8.4-14.1] vs 2.0 [0.2-12.6]), p<0.001) and more likely to be of non-White ethnicity (70% (23/33) vs 43% (101/237), p=0.005). Children with MIS-C were four times more likely to be admitted to critical care (61% (22/36) vs 15% (40/267, p<0.001). In addition to the WHO criteria, children with MIS-C were more likely to present with headache (45% (13/29) vs 11% (19/171), p<0.001), myalgia (39% (11/28) vs 7% (12/170), p<0.001), sore throat (37% (10/27) vs (13% (24/183, p = 0.004) and fatigue (57% (17/30) vs 31% (60/192), p =0.012) than children who did not and to have a platelet count of less than 150 x109/L (30% (10/33) vs 10% (24/232), p=0.004).

ConclusionsOur data confirms less severe covid-19 in children and young people than in adults and we provide additional evidence for refining the MIS-C case definition. The identification of a muco-enteric symptom cluster also raises the suggestion that MIS-C is the severe end of a spectrum of disease.

However, little is known about risk factors associated with worsened mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

ObjectiveTo investigate the factors associated with serious psychological distress (SPD) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA cross-sectional study using a large-scale internet survey conducted between August 25 and September 30, 2020, in Japan.

ExposuresDemographics (age, gender, marital status, family composition, and caregiving burden), socio-economic status (income level, employment type, educational attainment), the experience of domestic violence (DV), the state of emergency, fear of COVID-19, and stigma related to COVID-19.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresPrevalence of SPD, defined as Kessler 6 scale score [&ge;]13.

ResultsAmong 25,482 individuals included in this study, 2,556 (10%) met the criteria of SPD. Overall, women (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.59; 95%CI, 1.17-2.16; P=0.003), ages 15-29 (aOR compared with ages 45-59, 2.35; 95%CI, 1.64-3.38; P<0.001), low income (aOR compared with intermediate income, 1.70; 95%CI, 1.16-2.49; P=0.007), providing caregiving to family members (aOR, 5.48; 95%CI, 3.51-8.56; P<0.001), experiencing DV (aOR, 5.72; 95%CI, 3.81-8.59; P<0.001), and fear of COVID-19 (aOR, 1.96; 95%CI, 1.55-2.48; P<0.001) were associated with a higher rate of SPD. Among women aged 15-29 years, who experienced the highest rate of SPD, caregiving, DV, fear of COVID-19, and COVID-19-related stigma were associated with a higher rate of SPD; whereas economic situation (income level and employment type) and social isolation (marital status) were not associated with the prevalence of SPD.

Conclusions and RelevanceEconomic situation, caregiving burden, DV, and fear of COVID-19 were independently associated with SPD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among young women--who have a higher risk of suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan--similar factors, except economic situation, were associated with a higher rate of SPD. Targeted interventions based on age and gender may be more effective in mitigating the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the populations mental health.","Yoshioka, T.; Okubo, R.; Tabuchi, T.; Odani, S.; Shinozaki, T.; Tsugawa, Y.",2021-03-01,Health Policy,10.1101/2021.02.27.21252458,1,Yusuke Tsugawa,UCLA,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.27.21252458v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.27.21252458v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
2397,Analysis of early renal injury in COVID-19 and diagnostic value of multi-index combined detection,"ObjectivesThe aim of the study was to analyze the incidence of COVID-19 with early renal injury, and to explore the value of multi-index combined detection in diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19.

DesignThe study was an observational, descriptive study.

SettingThis study was carried out in a tertiary hospital in Guangdong, China.

Participants12 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 20, 2020 to February 20, 2020.

Primary and secondary outcome measuresThe primary outcome was to evaluate the incidence of early renal injury in COVID-19. In this study, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) and urine microalbumin / urinary creatinine ratio (UACR) were calculated to assess the incidence of early renal injury. Secondary outcomes were the diagnostic value of urine microalbumin (UMA), 1-microglobulin (A1M), urine immunoglobulin-G (IGU), urine transferring (TRU) alone and in combination in diagnosis of COVID-19 with early renal injury.

ResultsWhile all patients had no significant abnormalities in serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), the abnormal rates of eGFR, Ccr, and UACR were 66.7%, 41.7%, and 41.7%, respectively. Urinary microprotein detection indicated that the area under curve (AUC) of multi-index combined to diagnose early renal injury in COVID-19 was 0.875, which was higher than UMA (0,813), A1M (0.813), IGU (0.750) and TRU (0.750) alone. Spearman analysis showed that the degree of early renal injury was significantly related to C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil ratio (NER), suggesting that the more severe the infection, the more obvious the early renal injury. Hypokalemia and hyponatremia were common in patients with COVID-19, and there was a correlation with the degree of renal injury.

ConclusionsEarly renal injury was common in patients with COVID-19. Combined detection of UMA, A1M, IGU, and TRU was helpful for the diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19.","Hong, X.-W.; Chi, Z.-P.; Liu, G.-Y.; Huang, H.; Guo, S.-Q.; Fan, J.-R.; Lin, X.-W.; Qu, L.-Z.; Chen, R.-L.; Wu, L.-J.; Wang, L.-Y.; Zhang, Q.-C.; Wu, S.-W.; Pan, Z.-Q.; Lin, H.; Zhou, Y.-H.; Zhang, Y.-H.",2020-03-12,Nephrology,10.1101/2020.03.07.20032599,2,Yong-Hai Zhang,Shantou Central Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.07.20032599v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.07.20032599v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
17712,A prospective study of risk factors associated with seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in healthcare workers at a large UK teaching hospital,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow at an unprecedented rate. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection than the general population but risk factors for HCW infection are not well described.

MethodsWe conducted a prospective sero-epidemiological study of HCWs at a UK teaching hospital using a SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. Risk factors for seropositivity were analysed using multivariate logistic regression.

Findings410/5,698 (7{middle dot}2%) staff tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Seroprevalence was higher in those working in designated COVID-19 areas compared with other areas (9{middle dot}47% versus 6{middle dot}16%) Healthcare assistants (aOR 2{middle dot}06 [95%CI 1{middle dot}14-3{middle dot}71]; p=0{middle dot}016) and domestic and portering staff (aOR 3{middle dot}45 [95% CI 1{middle dot}07-11{middle dot}42]; p=0{middle dot}039) had significantly higher seroprevalence than other staff groups after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity and COVID-19 working location. Staff working in acute medicine and medical sub-specialities were also at higher risk (aOR 2{middle dot}07 [95% CI 1{middle dot}31-3{middle dot}25]; p<0{middle dot}002). Staff from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds had an aOR of 1{middle dot}65 (95% CI 1{middle dot}32 - 2{middle dot}07; p<0{middle dot}001) compared to white staff; this increased risk was independent of COVID-19 area working. The only symptoms significantly associated with seropositivity in a multivariable model were loss of sense of taste or smell, fever and myalgia; 31% of staff testing positive reported no prior symptoms.

InterpretationRisk of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HCWs is heterogeneous and influenced by COVID-19 working location, role, age and ethnicity. Increased risk amongst BAME staff cannot be accounted for solely by occupational factors.

Research in context

Evidence before this studySpecific risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) are not well defined. Additionally, it is not clear how population level risk factors influence occupational risk in defined demographic groups. Only by identifying these factors can we mitigate and reduce the risk of occupational SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed a review of the evidence for HCW-specific risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We searched PubMed with the terms """"SARS-CoV-2"""" OR """"COVID-19"""" AND """"Healthcare worker"""" OR """"Healthcare Personnel"""" AND """"Risk factor"""" to identify any studies published in any language between December 2019 and September 2020. The search identified 266 studies and included a meta-analysis and two observational studies assessing HCW cohort seroprevalence data. Seroprevalence and risk factors for HCW infections varied between studies, with contradictory findings. In the two serological studies, one identified a significant increased risk of seroprevalence in those working with COVID-19 patients (Eyre et al 2020), as well as associations with job role and department. The other study (Dimcheff et al 2020) found no significant association between seropositivity and any identified demographic or occupational factor. A meta-analysis of HCW (Gomez-Ochoa et al 2020) assessed >230,000 participants as a pooled analysis, including diagnoses by both RT-PCR and seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and found great heterogeneity in study design and reported contradictory findings. Of note, they report a seropositivity rate of 7% across all studies reporting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCWs. Nurses were the most frequently affected healthcare personnel and staff working in non-emergency inpatient settings were the most frequently affected group. Our search found no prospective studies systematically evaluating HCW specific risk factors based entirely on seroprevalence data.

Added value of this studyOur prospective cohort study of almost 6,000 HCWs at a large UK teaching hospital strengthens previous findings from UK-based cohorts in identifying an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure amongst HCWs. Specifically, factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 exposure include caring for confirmed COVID-19 cases and identifying as being within specific ethnic groups (BAME staff). We further delineated the risk amongst BAME staff and demonstrate that occupational factors alone do not account for all of the increased risk amongst this group. We demonstrate for the first time that healthcare assistants represent a key at-risk occupational group, and challenge previous findings of significantly higher risk amongst nursing staff. Seroprevalence in staff not working in areas with confirmed COVID-19 patients was only marginally higher than that of the general population within the same geographical region. This observation could suggest the increased risk amongst HCWs arises through occupational exposure to confirmed cases and could account for the overall higher seroprevalence in HCWs, rather than purely the presence of staff in healthcare facilities. Over 30% of seropositive staff had not reported symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and in those who did report symptoms, differentiating COVID-19 from other causes based on symptom data alone was unreliable.

Implications of all the available evidenceInternational efforts to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HCWs need to be prioritised. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HCWs is heterogenous but also follows demonstrable patterns. Potential mechanisms to reduce the risk for staff working in areas with confirmed COVID-19 patients include improved training in hand hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE), better access to high quality PPE, and frequent asymptomatic testing. Wider asymptomatic testing in healthcare facilities has the potential to reduce spread of SARS-CoV-2 within hospitals, thereby reducing patient and staff risk and limiting spread between hospitals and into the wider community. The increased risk of COVID-19 amongst BAME staff cannot be explained by purely occupational factors; however, the increased risk amongst minority ethnic groups identified here was stark and necessitates further evaluation.","Cooper, D.

12693,Mathematical modeling of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 '' Evaluating the impact of isolation in Sao Paulo State (Brazil) and lockdown in Spain associated with protective measures on the epidemic of covid-19,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), with the fatality rate in elder (60 years old or more) being much higher than young (60 years old or less) patients, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Taking into account this age-dependent fatality rate, a mathematical model considering young and elder subpopulations was formulated based on the natural history of covid-19 to study the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. This model can be applied to study the epidemiological scenario resulting from the adoption of isolation or lockdown in many countries to control the rapid propagation of covid-19. We chose as examples the isolation adopted in Sao Paulo State (Brazil) in the early phase but not at the beginning of the epidemic, and the lockdown implemented in Spain when the number of severe covid-19 cases was increasing rapidly. Based on the data collected from Sao Paulo State and Spain, the model parameters were evaluated and we obtained higher estimation for the basic reproduction number R0 (9.24 for Sao Paulo State, and 8 for Spain) compared to the currently accepted estimation of R0 around 3. The model allowed to explain the flattening of the epidemic curves by isolation in Sao Paulo State and lockdown in Spain when associated with the protective measures (face mask and social distancing) adopted by the population. However, a simplified mathematical model providing lower estimation for R0 did not explain the flattening of the epidemic curves. The implementation of the isolation in Sao Paulo State before the rapidly increasing phase of the epidemic enlarged the period of the first wave of the epidemic and delayed its peak, which are the desirable results of isolation to avoid the overloading in the health care system.","Yang, H.

20114,"Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices of People living with SCI towards COVID-19 and their Psychological State during In-patient Rehabilitation in Bangladesh","Study DesignA prospective cross-sectional survey.

ObjectiveThe study aimed to examine the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) of people living with Spinal cord injury (SCI) towards COVID-19 and their psychological status during in-patient rehabilitation in Bangladesh.

SettingThe Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralyzed (CRP) and the National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedic Rehabilitation (NITOR), two tertiary level hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

MethodsFrom July to September 2020, a prospective, cross-sectional survey of SCI subjects, 13-78 years of age, carried out in two SCI rehab centers in Bangladesh. Data has been collected by face to face interview through a pretested, and language validated questionnaire on KAP and Depression, Anxiety, Stress (DASS). Ethical approval and trial registration obtained prospectively. As all the patients were previously living with Spinal cord injury (SCI), therefore, all the patients admitted/ attend SCI rehab centers were considered as SCI positive samples.

ResultsA total of 207 people with SCI responded, 87%were male, and 13% were female with mean age34.18{+/-}12.9 years. 33.8% was tetraplegic and 66.2% was paraplegic and 63.8% of them were diagnosed ASIA-A, with motor score 45.38{+/-}19.5, sensory score 97.2{+/-}52, SpO2 95.07{+/-}3.3, and Vo2max 35.7{+/-}3.7mL/kg/min. 178 people had at least one health issue. Overall knowledge score was 8.59{+/-}2.3 out of 12, depression 11.18{+/-}8, anxiety 7.72{+/-}5.1, and stress was 9.32{+/-}6.7 from a total of 21 scores each. There was a correlation between Knowledge and DASS with age (P<.05); and Knowledge with gender (P<.05), and education (P<.01). Binary logistic regression found a higher association of Knowledge and DASS with gender (OR 6.6, 6.6, .95, 6.6; P<.01); and young age (OR.418, P<.01), illiterate (OR3.81, P<.01), and rural people (OR.48, P<.05) with knowledge. A linear relation was noted between depression and anxiety scores (r.45, P<.01) and stress scores (r.58, P<.01). A positive attitude was reported for the majority of subjects. SCI Persons reported they and the caregiver followed health advisory in consulting health professionals (65.7%), isolation (63.8%), droplet precaution (87.4%), and hygiene (90.3%).

ConclusionsDuring in-patient rehabilitation in Bangladesh, the majority of SCI reported that they had communicated with health professionals and practiced behaviors that would reduce transmission and risk of COVID-19.","Hossain, M.

20813,"Modeling the COVID-19 transmission in Italy: The roles of asymptomatic cases, social distancing, and lockdowns in the first and the second waves","The SEIR model of COVID-19 is developed to investigate the roles of physical distancing, lockdowns and asymptomatic cases in Italy. In doing so, two types of policies including behavioral measures and lockdown measures are embedded in the model. Compared with existing models, the model successfully reproduces similar multiple observed outputs such as infected and recovered patients in Italy by July 2020. This study concludes that the first policy is important once the number of infected cases is relatively low. However, once the number of infected cases is very high so the society cannot identify infected and disinfected people, the second policy must be applied soon. It is thus this study suggests that relaxed lockdowns lead to the second wave of the COVID-19 around the world. It is hoped that the model can enhance our understanding on the roles of behavioral measures, lockdowns, and undocumented cases, so-called asymptomatic cases, on the COVID-19 flow.","Khairulbahri, M.",2021-03-23,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.01.08.21249273,3,Muhamad Khairulbahri,Bandung Institute of Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.08.21249273v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.08.21249273v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
17767,"Per capita COVID-19 Case Rates are Lower in U.S. Counties Voting more Heavily Democratic in the 2016 Presidential Election, except not in States with a Republican Governor and Legislature","In our recent paper Why do per capita COVID-19 Case Rates Differ Between U.S. States? we established that U.S. states with a Democratic governor and a Democratic legislature have lower COVID-19 per capita case rates than states with a Republican governor and a Republican legislature, and case rates of states with a mixed government fall between the two. This difference remained after accounting for differences between states in several demographic and socio-economic variables. In a recent working paper The Changing Political Geographies of COVID-19 in the U.S. it was found that that early in the pandemic U.S. counties at higher levels of percentage Democratic vote in the 2016 presidential election had higher weekly per capita COVID-19 rates, but that the situation was in the opposite direction by August 2020. We show here that counties with a higher percentage of Democratic vote in the 2016 presidential election have a lower mean cumulative per capita rate of COVID-19 cases and of COVID-19 deaths, adjusted for county demographic and socio-economic characteristics, but only for counties in states that currently have a Democratic governor and both chambers of the legislature Democratic or in states that have a mixed government, but not for states that currently have a Republican governor and both chambers in the legislature Republican. One possible contributor to this difference is that some state Republican governments have restricted local action to fight the spread of COVID-19.","Chambless, L.",2020-11-08,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.11.03.20225425,2,Lloyd Chambless,Retired,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.03.20225425v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.03.20225425v2.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
17675,Risk factors for outcomes of COVID-19 patients: an observational study of 795 572 patients in Russia,"BackgroundSeveral factors that could affect survival and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients require larger studies and closer attention.

ObjectiveTo investigate the impact of factors including whether COVID-19 was clinically or laboratory-diagnosed, influenza vaccination, former or current tuberculosis, HIV, and other comorbidities on the hospitalized patients outcomes.

DesignObservational nationwide cohort study.

PatientsAll subjects, regardless of age, admitted to 4,251 Russian hospitals indexed in the Federal Register of COVID-19 patients between March 26, 2020, and June 3, 2020. All included patients for which complete clinical data were available were divided into two cohorts, with laboratory- and clinically verified COVID-19.

MeasurementsWe analyzed patients age and sex, COVID-19 ICD-10 code, the length of the hospital stay, and whether they required ICU treatment or invasive mechanical ventilation. The other variables for analysis were: verified diagnosis of pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, diseases of the endocrine system, cancer/malignancy, HIV, tuberculosis, and the data on influenza vaccination in the previous six months.

ResultsThis study enrolled 705,572 COVID-19 patients aged from 0 to 121 years, 50.4% females. 164,195 patients were excluded due to no confirmed COVID-19 (n=143,357) or insufficient and invalid clinical data (n=20,831). 541,377 participants were included in the study, 413,950 (76.5%) of them had laboratory-verified COVID-19, and 127,427 patients (23.5%) with the clinical verification. Influenza vaccination reduced the risk of transfer to the ICU (OR 0.76), mechanical ventilation requirement (OR 0.74), and the risk of death (HR 0.77). TB increased the mortality risk (HR 1.74) but reduced the likelihood of transfer to the ICU (OR 0.27). HIV comorbidity significantly increased the risks of transfer to the ICU (OR 2.46) and death (HR 1.60). Patients with the clinically verified COVID-19 had a shorter duration of hospital stay (HR 1.45) but a higher risk of mortality (HR 1.08) and the likelihood of being ventilated (OR 1.36). According to the previously published data, age, male sex, endocrine disorders, and cardiovascular diseases increased the length of hospital stay, the risk of death, and transfer to the ICU.

LimitationsThe study did not include a control group of subjects with no COVID-19. Because of that, some of the identified factors could not be specific for COVID-19.

ConclusionsInfluenza vaccination could reduce the severity of the hospitalized patients clinical outcomes, including mortality, regardless of age, social, and economic group. The other factors considered in the study did not reduce the assessed risks, but we observed several non-trivial associations that may optimize the management of COVID-19 patients.","Demkina, A.

24944,COVID-19 and mortality risk in patients with psychiatric disorders,"COVID-19 has already caused the deaths of over 2.5 million people worldwide. Patients with certain medical conditions and severe psychiatric disorders are at increased risk of dying from it. However, such people have a reduced life expectancy anyway, raising the question whether COVID-19 incurs a specific risk for such patients for dying, over and above the risk of dying from other causes.

We analysed the UK Biobank data of half a million middle-aged participants from the UK. From the start of 2020 up to 24th January 2021, 894 participants had died from COVID-19 and another 4,562 had died from other causes. We demonstrate that the risk of dying from COVID-19 among patients with mental health problems, especially those with dementia, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder, is increased compared to the risk of dying from other causes. This increase among patients with severe psychiatric disorders cannot be explained solely by the higher rate of diabetes or cardiovascular disorders.","Kirov, G.; Baker, E.",2021-04-13,Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology,10.1101/2021.04.08.21255046,1,George Kirov,Cardiff University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.08.21255046v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.08.21255046v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA

The positivity rate was 92.0%, 161 from 175 individuals remained IgG positive. We observed a contraction in the overall IgG levels measured by ELISA. The median IgG dropped 62% from June to December 2020. Most of the individuals tested (87%) reported to be asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic. No difference was found between men and women, but people aged less than 50 showed a lower IgG level in each period compared to older individuals.

24150,Point-of-care lung ultrasonography for early identification of mild COVID-19: a prospective cohort of outpatients in a Swiss screening center,"BackgroundEarly identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection is important to guide quarantine and reduce transmission. This study evaluates the diagnostic performance of lung ultrasound (LUS), an affordable, consumable-free point-of-care tool, for COVID-19 screening.

MethodsThis prospective observational cohort included adults presenting with cough and/or dyspnea at a SARS-CoV-2 screening center of Lausanne University Hospital between March 31st and May 8th, 2020. Investigators recorded standardized LUS images and videos in 10 lung zones per subject. Two blinded independent experts reviewed LUS recording and classified abnormal findings according to pre-specified criteria to investigate their predictive value to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection according to PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs (COVIDpos vs COVIDneg). We finally combined LUS and clinical findings to derive a multivariate logistic regression diagnostic score.

ResultsOf 134 included patients, 23% (n=30/134) were COVIDpos and 77% (n=103/134) were COVIDneg; 85%, (n=114/134) cases were previously healthy healthcare workers presenting within 2 to 5 days of symptom onset (IQR). Abnormal LUS findings were significantly more frequent in COVIDpos compared to COVIDneg (45% versus 26%, p=0.045) and mostly consisted of focal pathologic B-lines. Combining LUS findings in a multivariate logistic regression score had an area under the receiver-operating curve of 63.9% to detect COVID-19, but improved to 84.5% with the addition of clinical features

ConclusionsCOVIDpos patients are significantly more likely to have lung pathology by LUS. Our findings have potential diagnostic value for COVID-19 at the point of care. Combination of clinical and LUS features showed promising results, which need confirmation in a larger study population.

23212,A systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal cohort studies comparing mental health before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BackgroundIncreases in mental health problems have been observed in some studies during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear whether changes have been large and experienced by most population sub-groups, persisted over time or been symptom specific.

MethodsWe systematically reviewed and meta-analysed longitudinal cohort studies that examined changes in mental health among the same group of participants before and during the pandemic (PROSPERO: CRD42021231256). Searches for published and unpublished studies were conducted in January 2021. Changes in mental health (standardised mean change; SMC) were examined using meta-analyses.

FindingsSixty-five studies were included. There was an overall increase in mental health symptoms that was most pronounced during March-April 2020 (SMC = .102 [95% CI: .026 to .192], p = 0.03) before significantly declining over time (May-July SMC = .067 [95% CI: -.022 to .157], p = .141). Compared to measures of anxiety (SMC = 0.13, p = 0.02) and general mental health (SMC = -.03, p = 0.65), increases in depression and mood disorder symptoms tended to be larger (SMC = 0.22, p < .001) and reductions over time appeared less pronounced. Increased mental health symptoms were observed across most population subgroups examined but there was no evidence of any change in symptoms among samples with a pre-existing mental health condition.

InterpretationThere was a small increase in mental health symptoms soon after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic that decreased and was comparable to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2020 among most population sub-groups and symptom types.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThere have been reported increases in mental health problems during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is unclear whether changes in mental health problems have been symptom specific, how changes have differed across populations and whether increased mental health problems have persisted over time. We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed longitudinal cohort studies that examined mental health among the same participants prior to and during the pandemic in 2020. This approach allowed us to quantify the mental health burden associated with the outbreak of the pandemic and how it has changed over time. We searched Pubmed, SCOPUS, Web of Science and PsychInfo from January 2020 to January 11, 2021 and identified eligible unpublished articles available on pre-print servers.

Added value of this studyWe identified 65 eligible articles that reported 201 comparisons of mental health pre vs. post pandemic outbreak. Meta-analysis indicated that longitudinal cohort studies that examined mental health prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 showed a significant but statistically small increase in mental health symptoms. The overall increase in mental health symptoms was most pronounced during the early stages of the pandemic (March-April), before decreasing and being generally comparable to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2020.

Compared to anxiety and general measures of mental health functioning, increases tended to be larger in depressive symptoms and although statistically small, remained elevated past the early stages of the pandemic. Increases in mental health symptoms were observed across most population sub-groups, but there was no evidence of a change in mental health symptoms among samples of participants with a pre-existing mental health condition.

Implications of all the available evidenceFindings confirm that the initial outbreak of the pandemic was associated with a significant but statistically small increase in mental health symptoms. Given that small effects may have meaningful cumulative consequences at the population level, there is a need for continued mental health provision and monitoring particularly during periods of the pandemic when infection rates and deaths are high. Further into the pandemic, mental health problems decreased significantly, which indicated recovery and resilience in overall mental health. Contrary to predictions made early in the pandemic, there was also no evidence of a worsening of mental health symptoms among samples of participants with a pre-existing mental health condition. Overall the results of the present analyses suggest that the pandemic may not have caused an unprecedented and long lasting mental health crisis, instead there appears to have been resilience in mental health.","Robinson, E.; Sutin, A.

23698,Faecal shedding models for SARS-CoV-2 RNA amongst hospitalised patients and implications for wastewater-based epidemiology,"The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in faeces is not well established, posing challenges for wastewater-based surveillance of COVID-19 and risk assessments of environmental transmission. We develop versatile hierarchical models for faecal RNA shedding and apply them to data collected in six studies. We find that the mean number of gene copies per mL of faeces is 1.9x106 (2.3x105--2.0x108 95% credible interval) amongst hospitalised patients. We find no evidence for a subpopulation of patients who do not shed RNA: limits of quantification can account for negative stool samples. Our models indicate that hospitalised patients represent the tail of the shedding profile with a half-life of 34 hours (28--43 95% credible interval), suggesting that wastewater-based surveillance signals are more indicative of incidence than prevalence and can be a leading indicator of clinical presentation. Shedding amongst inpatients cannot explain high RNA concentrations observed in wastewater, consistent with more abundant shedding during the early infection course.","Hoffmann, T.; Alsing, J.",2021-03-17,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.03.16.21253603,1,Till Hoffmann,Imperial College London,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.16.21253603v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.16.21253603v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
22376,Sensitivity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay as an aid in determining previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundThe Elecsys(R) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics International Ltd) was developed for the in vitro qualitative detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated the sensitivity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay in samples from a diverse cross-section of patients across multiple sites and compared results against commercially available comparators.

MethodsSensitivity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay was evaluated using anonymised, frozen, residual single and sequential serum and plasma samples from patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and method comparisons performed versus the following comparator assays: Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Siemens ADVIA Centaur SARS-CoV-2 Total, and YHLO iFlash SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM.

ResultsOverall sensitivity for the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay in 219 samples drawn [&ge;]14 days post-PCR confirmation was 93.6% (95% CI 89.5-96.5). Across the three study sites, sensitivity in samples drawn [&ge;]14 days post-PCR confirmation ranged from 85.7-98.9%. Sensitivity was significantly higher for the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay compared with the YHLO iFlash SARS-CoV-2 IgM assay for samples drawn [&ge;]14 days post-PCR confirmation (86.3% [95% CI 76.7-92.9] versus 33.8% [95% CI 23.6-45.2]). Both Siemens ADVIA Centaur SARS-CoV-2 Total and YHLO iFlash SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays had a significantly higher sensitivity compared with the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay for samples drawn [&ge;]14 days post-PCR confirmation (95.1% [95% CI 87.8-98.6] versus 85.2% [95% CI 75.6-92.1]; 93.8% [95% CI 86.0-97.9] versus 86.3% [95% CI 76.7-92.9]). Differences in sensitivity between the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay and the Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (90.3% [95% CI 83.7-94.9] versus 95.2% [95% CI 89.8-98.2]) and Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG (84.8% [95% CI 75.0-91.9] versus 87.3% [95% CI 78.0-93.8]) assays for samples drawn [&ge;]14 days post-PCR confirmation were not significant.

ConclusionsThe Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay demonstrated high sensitivity in samples collected [&ge;]14 days post-PCR confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and comparable sensitivity to several commercially available comparator assays across multiple sites, supporting the use of this assay as a tool to aid in determination of previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

19158,ABO-RH blood group and risk of covid-19 in a moroccan population,"IntroductionGiven the rapid spread, significant morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19, there has been scientific interest in obtaining data detailing the factors influencing the risk of COVID-19 infection. The aim of this study was to reveal a possible association between the ABO-RH system and the risk of COVID-19 in the Moroccan population.

Materials and methodsThis is an analytical cross-sectional study. It was carried out on 1094 patients for the diagnosis of Covid-19 by Rt-PCR at the Moulay Ismail military hospital in the province of Meknes. All Rt-PCR negative individuals were used as a comparison group.

ResultsAmong the 1094 individuals who were diagnosed, RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 was positive for 242 individuals. Comparison of the proportions of blood groups of the two groups showed that the proportion of blood group A in patients with COVID-19 was significantly higher than in people in the comparison group (P = 0.007), while the proportion of blood group O in patients with COVID-19 was significantly lower than in people in the control group (P = 0.017). Comparison of the Rh blood groups of the two groups did not find a significant association (P = 0.608).

ConclusionAs demonstrated by several previous studies, we concluded that blood group A was associated with a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19. Equally, the O blood group was associated with a lower risk of infection.","Belaouni, M.; Malki, E.; El Bahraouy, R.; El Maliki, B.; Er-Rami, M.; Louzi, H.; Lahmadi, K.",2020-12-04,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.12.02.20242180,1,Mourad Belaouni,Moulay Ismail military hospital of Meknes,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.02.20242180v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.02.20242180v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA

However, the association between COVID-19-associated mortality in patients with immunodeficiency and therapeutic use of convalescent plasma is unknown. We review clinical features and treatment protocols of COVID-19 patients with immunodeficiency after treatment with human convalescent plasma. We also discuss the time course and clinical features of recovery. These insights provide evidence for the need to develop a clear treatment protocol for COVID-19 patients with immunodeficiency and support the efficacy of convalescent plasma in patients with primary or secondary immunodeficiency.","Senefeld, J.; Klassen, S.

3049,Estimation of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Prevalence in Santa Clara County,"To reliably estimate the demand on regional health systems and perform public health planning, it is necessary to have a good estimate of the prevalence of infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) in the population. In the absence of wide-spread testing, we provide one approach to infer prevalence based on the assumption that the fraction of true infections needing hospitalization is fixed and that all hospitalized cases of COVID-19 in Santa Clara are identified.

Our goal is to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, i.e. the true number of people currently infected with the virus, divided by the total population size.

Our analysis suggests that as of March 17, 2020, there are 6,500 infections (0.34% of the population) of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County. Based on adjusting the parameters of our model to be optimistic (respectively pessimistic), the number of infections would be 1,400 (resp. 26,000), corresponding to a prevalence of 0.08% (resp. 1.36%). If the shelter-in-place led to R0 < 1, we would expect the number of infections to remain about constant for the next few weeks. However, even if this were true, we expect to continue to see an increase in hospitalized cases of COVID-19 in the short term due to the fact that infection of SARS-CoV-2 on March 17th can lead to hospitalizations up to 14 days later.","Yadlowsky, S.; Shah, N.; Steinhardt, J.",2020-03-27,Health Policy,10.1101/2020.03.24.20043067,1,Steve Yadlowsky,Stanford University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20043067v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20043067v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
16594,COVID-19 vaccination rate and protection attitudes can determine the best prioritisation strategy to reduce fatalities,"Background: The unprecedented rapid development of vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus creates in itself a new challenge for governments and health authorities: the effective vaccination of large numbers of people in a short time and, possibly, with shortage of vaccine doses. To whom vaccinate first and in what sequence, if any at all, to avoid the most fatalities remains an open question. Methods: A compartmental model considering age-related groups was developed to evaluate and compare vaccine distribution strategies in terms of the total avoidable fatalities. Population groups are established based on relevant differences in mortality (due to e.g. their age) and risk-related traits (such as their behaviour and number of daily person-to-person interactions). Vaccination distribution strategies were evaluated for different vaccine effectiveness levels, population coverage and vaccination rate using data mainly from Spain. Findings: Our results show that, if children could also be included in the vaccination, a rollout by priority to groups with the highest number of daily person-to-person interactions can achieve large reductions in total fatalities. This is due to the importance of the avoided subsequent infections inflicted on the rest of the population by highly interactive individuals. If children are excluded from the vaccination, the differences between priority strategies become smaller and appear highly depending on rollout rate, coverage and the levels of self-protection and awareness exercised by the population. Interpretation: These results are in possible contradiction with several published plans for COVID-19 vaccination and highlight the importance of conducting an open comprehensive and thorough analysis of this problem leaving behind possible preconceptions.","Rodriguez, J.; Paton, M.; Acuna, J.

19529,Impact of Nasopharyngeal Specimen Quality on SARS-CoV-2 Test Performance,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) cycle of threshold (Ct) has been used to estimate quantitative viral load, with the goal of targeting isolation precautions for individuals with COVID-19 and guiding public health interventions. However, variability in specimen quality can alter the Ct values obtained from SARS-CoV-2 clinical assays. We sought to define how variable nasopharyngeal (NP) swab quality impacts clinical SARS-CoV-2 test sensitivity.

MethodsWe performed amplification of a human gene target ({beta}-actin) in parallel with a clinical RT-PCR targeting the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gene for 1311 NP specimens collected from patients with clinical concern for COVID-19. We evaluated the relationship between NP specimen quality, characterized by high Ct values for the human gene target {beta}-actin Ct, and the probability of SARS-CoV-2 detection via logistic regression, as well as the linear relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and {beta}-actin Ct.

ResultsLow quality NP swabs are less likely to detect SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio 0.654, 95%CI 0.523 to 0.802). We observed a positive linear relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and {beta}-actin Ct values (slope 0.169, 95%CI 0.092 to 0.247). COVID-19 disease severity was not associated with {beta}-actin Ct values.

ConclusionsVariability in NP specimen quality accounts for significant differences in the sensitivity of clinical SARS-CoV-2 assays. If unrecognized, low quality NP specimens, which are characterized by a low level of amplifiable human DNA target, may limit the application of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values to direct infection control and public health interventions.","Richard-Greenblatt, M.; Ziegler, M.

3288,First month of the epidemic caused by COVID-19 in Italy: current status and real-time outbreak development forecast,"BackgroundThe first outbreaks of COVID-19 in Italy occurred during the second half of February 2020 in some areas in the North of the country. Due to the high contagiousness of the infection, further spread by asymptomatic people, Italy has become in a few weeks the country with the greatest number of infected people after China. The large number of severe cases among infected people in Italy led to the hospitalization of thousands of patients, with a heavy burden on the National Health Service.

MethodsWe analyzed data provided daily by Italian Authorities for the period from 24 February 2020 to 26 March 2020. Considering such information, we developed a forecast model in real-time, based on the cumulative logistic distribution. We then produced an estimate of the overall number of potentially infected individuals and epidemic duration at a national and Regional level, for the most affected Regions.

ResultsWe reported the daily distribution of performed swabs and confirmed cases, and the cumulative distribution of confirmed cases, of patients quarantined at home (42%), hospitalized in non-intensive care (31%), recovered or discharged (13%), deceased (10%), and hospitalized in intensive care (4%). The forecast model estimated a number of infected persons for Italy of 115,000 about, and a duration of the epidemic not less than 2 months.

ConclusionsOnce month after the first outbreaks there seems to be the first signs of a decrease in the number of infections, showing that we could be now facing the descending phase of the epidemic. The forecast obtained thanks to our model could be used by decision-makers to implement coordinative and collaborative efforts in order to control the epidemic.","Megna, R.",2020-03-30,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.26.20044628,1,Rosario Megna,National Council of Research,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044628v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044628v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1186/s41256-020-00170-3
22375,"Investigation and public health response to a COVID-19 outbreak in a rural resort community--Blaine County, Idaho, 2020","Blaine County, Idaho, a rural area with a renowned resort, experienced an outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We undertook an epidemiologic investigation to describe the outbreak and guide public health action. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified from reports of SARS-CoV-2-positive laboratory test results to South Central Public Health District.

Information on symptoms, hospitalization, recent travel, healthcare worker status, and close contacts was obtained by medical record review and patient interviews. Viral sequence analysis was conducted on a subset of available specimens. During March 13-April 10, 2020, a total of 451 COVID-19 cases occurred among Blaine County residents (1,959 cases per 100,000 population). An additional 37 cases occurred in out-of-state residents. Among the 451 COVID-19 patients, the median age was 51 years (Interquartile range [IQR]: 37-63), 52 (11.5%) were hospitalized, and 5 (1.1%) died. The median duration between specimen collection and a positive laboratory result was 9 days (IQR: 4-10). Forty-four (9.8%) patients reported recent travel. Healthcare workers comprised 56 (12.4%) cases; 33 of whom worked at the only hospital in the county, leading to a 15-day disruption of hospital services. Of 562 close contacts monitored by public health authorities, 22 (3.9%) had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and an additional 29 (5.2%) experienced compatible symptoms. Sequencing results from 34 Idaho specimens supported epidemiologic findings indicating travel as a source of SARS-CoV-2, and identified multiple lineages among hospital workers. Community mitigation strategies included school and resort closure, stay-at-home orders, and restrictions on incoming travelers. COVID-19 outbreaks in rural communities can disrupt health services. Lack of local laboratory capacity led to long turnaround times for COVID-19 test results. Rural communities frequented by tourists should consider implementing restrictions on incoming travelers among other mitigation strategies to reduce COVID-19 transmission.","Dunne, E.

12112,Distributional challenges regarding data on death and incidences during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic up to July 2020,"COVID-19 is a major global crisis with unpredictable consequences. Many scientists have struggled to make forecasts about its impact. Especially, appropriate preparations for a second wave are needed not to move in a costly panic mode again. It is necessary to get ideas about worst case scenarios regarding incidences, hospitalization, or use of ICU resources. They can be described in terms of extreme quantiles (95%, 99%, 99.9%) of specific distributions that supposedly formalize the data mechanism behind future observations.

Therefore, distributional issues do matter. Cirillo and Taleb argue that a natural and empirically correct framework for assessing and managing real risk in pandemics is provided by extreme value theory dealing with extrema and not averages. We explore this idea in more detail.

In this paper we discuss the fat-tail patterns in the distribution of the global COVID-19 data by analyzing data from 66 countries worldwide. We also explore their relevance at a lower, regional scale perspective (national, federal state), which is in our opinion more relevant for planning measures against the epidemic spread. For this we analyze data from the German federal state of Bavaria.

We conclude that fat-tail patterns are seen in global data, possibly reflecting the respective heterogeneity between different countries regarding incidences and fatalities during the ongoing epidemic. However, the disease activity at regional level seems to be better described by classical Poisson based models. To bridge the gap between regional and global phenomena we refer to mixtures of slim-tail distributions that may create fat-tail features.

Especially in the beginning of a pandemic acting according to the """"better safe than sorry"""" principle and taking extreme forecasts as the basis for the decisions might be justified. However, as the pandemic continues and control measures are partially lifted, there is a need for a careful discussion how to choose relevant distributions and their respective quantiles for future resource planning in order not to cause more harm as the pandemic itself.","Manz, K.; Mansmann, U.",2020-07-24,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.07.24.20161257,1,Ulrich Mansmann,Ludwig Maximilians University Munich,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.20161257v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.20161257v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
21830,Extremely high SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a strictly-Orthodox Jewish community in the UK,"BackgroundEthnic and religious minorities have been disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. The UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish community has been severely affected by the pandemic. This group shares characteristics with other ethnic minorities including larger family sizes, higher rates of household crowding and relative socioeconomic deprivation. We studied a UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish population to understand how COVID-19 had spread within this community.

MethodsWe performed a household-focused cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey specific to three antigen targets. Randomly-selected households completed a standardised questionnaire and underwent serological testing with a multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We report clinical illness and testing before the serosurvey, seroprevalence stratified by age and gender. We used random-effects models to identify factors associated with infection and antibody titres.

FindingsA total of 343 households, consisting of 1,759 individuals, were recruited. Serum was available for 1,242 participants. The overall seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was 64.3% (95% CI 61.6-67.0%). The lowest seroprevalence was 27.6% in children under 5 years and rose to 73.8% in secondary school children and 74% in adults. Antibody titres were higher in symptomatic individuals and declined over time since reported COVID-19 symptoms, with the decline more marked for nucleocapsid titres.

InterpretationIn this tight-knit religious minority population in the UK, we report one of the highest SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence levels in the world to date. In the context of this high force of infection, all age groups experienced a high burden of infection. Actions to reduce the burden of disease in this and other minority populations are urgently required.

FundingThis work was jointly funded by UKRI and NIHR [COV0335; MR/V027956/1], a donation from the LSHTM Alumni COVID-19 response fund, HDR UK, the MRC and the Wellcome Trust. The funders had no role in the design, conduct or analysis of the study or the decision to publish.

Research In ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSIn January 2020, we searched PubMed for articles on rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst ethnic minority groups and amongst the Jewish population. Search teams included """"COVID-19"""", """"SARS-CoV-2"""", seroprevalence, """"ethnic minority"""", and """"Jewish"""" with no language restrictions. We also searched UK government documents on SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst minority groups. By January 2020, a large number of authors had reported that ethnic minority groups experienced higher numbers of cases and increased hospitalisations due to COVID-19. A small number of articles provided evidence that strictly-Orthodox Jewish populations had experienced a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection but extremely limited data was available on overall population level rates of infection amongst specific ethnic minority population groups. There was also extremely limited data on rates of infection amongst young children from ethnic minority groups.

Added value of the studyWe report findings from a population representative, household survey of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst a UK strictly Orthodox Jewish population. We demonstrate an extremely high seroprevalence rate of SARS-CoV-2 in this population which is more than five times the estimated seroprevalence nationally and five times the estimated seroprevalence in London. In addition the large number of children in our survey, reflective of the underlying population structure, allows us to demonstrate that in this setting there is a significant burden of disease in all age groups with secondary school aged children having an equivalent seroprevalence to adults.

Implications of the available evidenceOur data provide clear evidence of the markedly disproportionate impact of SARS-CoV-2 in minority populations. In this setting infection occurs at high rates across all age groups including pre-school, primary school and secondary school-age children. Contextually appropriate measures to specifically reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 amongst minority populations are urgently required.","Gaskell, K. M.; Johnson, M.; Gould, V.; Hunt, A.; Stone, N.

24820,The Value of a Regional Living COVID-19 Registry and the Challenges of Keeping It Alive,"BackgroundThe need for rapid access to regularly updated patient data for hypothesis testing, surge planning, and epidemiologic investigations underscore the value of updated registries that clinicians, researchers, and policy makers can easily access for local and regional planning. We sought to create an adaptive, living registry containing detailed clinical and epidemiologic and outcome data from SARS-CoV-2-PCR-positive patients in our healthcare system.

MethodsFrom 03/13/202 onward, demographics, comorbidities, outpatient medications, along with 75 laboratory, 2 imaging, 19 therapeutic, and 4 outcome-related parameters were manually extracted from the electronic medical record of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. These parameters were entered on a registry featuring calculation, graphing tools, pivot tables, and a macro programming language. Initially, two internal medicine residents populated the database, then professional data abstractors populated the registry. When the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases released their COVID-19 case report form for public access, we adapted it and used it on a browser-based, metadata-driven electronic data capture software platform. Statistics were performed in R and Minitab.

ResultsAt the time of this submission, 200,807 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were performed on 107,604 distinct patients. 3699 (3.4%) of those have had positive results. Of those, 399 (11%) have had the more than 75 parameters full entered in the registry. The average follow-up period was 25 days (range 21-34 days). Age, male gender, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and cancer were associated with hospital admission (all p values < 0.01), but not ICU admission. Statin, ACEI-ARB, and acid suppressant use were associated with admission (all p values < 0.03). Obesity and history of autoimmune disease were not associated with need for admission. Supplemental oxygen, vasopressor requirement, and outpatient statin use were associated with increased mortality (all p values < 0.03).

ConclusionA living COVID-19 registry represents a mechanism to facilitate optimal sharing of data between providers, consumers, health information networks, and health plans through technology-enabled, secure-access electronic health information. Our approach also involves a diversity of new roles in the field, such as using residents, staff, and the quality department, in addition to professional data extractors and the health informatics team.

However, due to the overwhelming number of infections that continues to accelerate, and the labor/time intense nature of the project, only 11% of all patients with COVID-19 had all parameters entered in the registry. Therefore, this report also offers lessons learned and discusses sustainability issues, should others wish to establish a registry. It also highlights the local and broader public health significance of the registry.","Hanna, J.; Chen, T.; Portales-Castillo, C.; Newhart, D.; Schantz, K.; Rozzi, K.; Bress, J.; Lesho, E.",2021-04-09,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.04.06.21255019,1,Emil Lesho,Rochester Regional Health,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.06.21255019v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.06.21255019v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
15071,Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 and ARDS admitted to a third level health institution in Mexico City,"BackgroundIn December 2019, the first cases of severe pneumonia associated with a new coronavirus were reported in Wuhan, China. Severe respiratory failure requiring intensive care was reported in up to 5% of cases. There is, however, limited information available in Mexico.

ObjectivesThe purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations, and outcomes in a COVID-19 cohort attended to from March to May 2020 in our RICU. In addition, we explored the association of clinical variables with mortality.

MethodsThe first consecutive patients admitted to the RICU from March 3, 2020, to Jun 24, 2020, with confirmed COVID-19 were investigated. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a logistic regression model. The survival endpoint was mortality at discharge from the RICU.

ResultsData from 68 consecutive patients were analyzed. Thirty-eight patients survived, and 30 died (mortality: 44.1 %). Of the 16 predictive variables analyzed, only 6 remained significant in the multivariate analysis [OR (95% confidence interval)]: no acute kidney injury (AKI)/AKI 1: [.61 (.001;.192)]; delta lymphocyte count: [.061 (.006;.619)]; delta ventilatory ratio: [8.19 (1.40;47.8)]; norepinephrine support at admission: [34.3 (2.1;550)]; body mass index: [1.41 (1.09;1.83)]; and bacterial coinfection: [18.5 (1.4;232)].

ConclusionsWe report the characteristics and outcome of patients with ARDS and COVID-19. We found six independent factors associated with the mortality risk: delta lymphocyte count, delta ventilatory ratio, BMI, norepinephrine support, no AKI/AKI 1, and bacterial coinfection.","Lugo Goytia, G.; Hernandez-Cardenas,, C.; Torruco-Sotelo, C.; Jurado, F.; Serna-Secundino, H.; Aguilar, C.; Garcia-Olanzaran, J.; Hernandez-Garcia, D.",2020-09-14,Intensive Care And Critical Care Medicine,10.1101/2020.09.12.20193409,1,Gustavo Lugo Goytia,INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE ENFERMEDADES RESPIRATORIAS ISMAEL COSIO VILLEGAS,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.12.20193409v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.12.20193409v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
9450,A Comparative Study of Target Reconstruction of Ultra-High-Resolution CT for Patients with Corona-Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),"BackgroundThe corona-virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a serious public health risk. Compared with conventional high-resolution CT (C-HRCT, matrix 512), ultra-high resolution CT (U-HRCT, matrix 1024) can increase the effective pixel per unit volume by about 4 times. Our study is to evaluate the value of target reconstruction of U-HRCT in the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19.

MethodsA total of 13 COVID-19 cases, 44 cases of other pneumonias, and 6 cases of ground-glass nodules were retrospectively analyzed. The data were categorized into groups A (C-HRCT) and B (U-HRCT), following which iDose4-3 and iDose4-5 were used for target reconstruction, respectively. CT value, noise, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in different reconstructed images were measured. Two senior imaging doctors scored the image quality and the structure of the lesions on a 5-point scale. Chi-square test, variance analysis, and binarylogistic regression analysis were used for statistical analysis.

ResultsU-HRCT image can reduce noise and improve SNR with an increase of the iterative reconstruction level. The SNR of U-HRCT image was lower than that of the C-HRCT image of the same iDose4level, and the noise of U-HRCT was higher than that of C-HRCT image; the difference was statistically significant (P< 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed thatperipleural distribution, thickening of blood vessels and interlobular septum, and crazy-paving pattern were independent indictors of the COVID-19 on U-HRCT. U-HRCT was superior to C-HRCT in showing the blood vessels, bronchial wall, and interlobular septum in the ground-glass opacities; the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05).

ConclusionsPeripleural distribution, thickening of blood vessels and interlobular septum, and crazy-paving pattern on U-HRCT are favorable signs for COVID-19. U-HRCT is superior to C-HRCT in displaying the blood vessels, bronchial walls, and interlobular septum for evaluating COVID-19.","Lv, S.; Lin, Y.; Kang, J.; Duan, S.; Zhang, W.; Wang, J.-A.",2020-06-12,Radiology And Imaging,10.1101/2020.06.04.20119206,1,Weiguo Zhang,"Department of Radiology, Daping Hospital, Army Medical University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.04.20119206v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.04.20119206v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
19415,Effect of COVID-19 response policies on walking behavior in US cities,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused mass disruption to our daily lives. Mobility restrictions implemented to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have impacted walking behavior, but the magnitude and spatio-temporal aspects of these changes have yet to be explored. Walking is the most common form of physical activity and non-motorized transport, and so has an important role in our health and economy. Understanding how COVID-19 response measures have affected walking behavior of populations and distinct subgroups is paramount to help devise strategies to prevent the potential health and societal impacts of declining walking levels. In this study, we integrated mobility data from mobile devices and area-level data to study the walking patterns of 1.62 million anonymous users in 10 metropolitan areas in the United States (US). The data covers the period from mid-February 2020 (pre-lockdown) to late June 2020 (easing of lockdown restrictions). We detected when users were walking, measured distance walked and time of the walk, and classified each walk as recreational or utilitarian. Our results revealed dramatic declines in walking, especially utilitarian walking, while recreational walking has recovered and even surpassed the levels before the pandemic. However, our findings demonstrated important social patterns, widening existing inequalities in walking behavior across socio-demographic groups. COVID-19 response measures had a larger impact on walking behavior for those from low-income areas, of low education, and high use of public transportation. Provision of equal opportunities to support walking could be key to opening up our society and the economy.","Hunter, R. F.; Garcia, L.; De Sa, T. H.; Zapata-Diomedi, B.; Millett, C.

4802,Differential ventilation using flow control valves as a potential bridge to full ventilatory support during the COVID-19 crisis,"BackgroundIt has been projected that there will be too few ventilators to meet demand during the COVID-19 (SARS CoV-2) pandemic. Ventilator sharing has been suggested as a crisis standard of care strategy to increase availability of mechanical ventilation. The safety and practicality of shared ventilation in patients is unknown. We designed and evaluated a system whereby one mechanical ventilator can be used to simultaneously ventilate two patients who have different lung compliances using a custom manufactured flow control valve to allow for individual adjustment of tidal volume and airway pressure for each patient.

MethodsThe system was first evaluated in a simulation lab using two human patient simulators under expected clinical conditions. It was then tested in an observational study of four patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Two separately ventilated COVID-19 patients were connected to a single ventilator for one hour. This intervention was repeated in a second pair of patients. Ventilatory parameters (tidal volume, peak airway pressures, compliance) were recorded at five minute intervals during both studys. Arterial blood gases were taken at zero, thirty, and sixty minutes. The primary outcome was maintenance of stable acid-base status and oxygenation during shared ventilation.

ResultsTwo male and two female patients, age range 32-56 yrs, participated. Ideal body weight and driving pressure were markedly different among patients. All patients demonstrated stable physiology and ventilation for the duration of shared ventilation. In one patient tidal volume was increased after 30 minutes to correct a respiratory acidosis.

ConclusionsDifferential ventilation using a single ventilator and a split breathing circuit with flow control valves is possible. A single ventilator could feasibly be used to safely ventilate two COVID-19 patients simultaneously as a bridge to full ventilatory support.

13113,Estimating the Changing Infection Rate of COVID-19 Using Bayesian Models of Mobility,"In order to prepare for and control the continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic while minimizing its economic impact, the world needs to be able to estimate and predict COVID-19s spread. Unfortunately, we cannot directly observe the prevalence or growth rate of COVID-19; these must be inferred using some kind of model. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian extension to the classic susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model that adds compartments to account for isolation and death and allows the infection rate to vary as a function of both mobility data collected from mobile phones and a latent time-varying factor that accounts for changes in behavior not captured by mobility data. Since confirmed-case data is unreliable, we infer the models parameters conditioned on deaths data. We replace the exponential-waiting-time assumption of classic compartmental models with Erlang distributions, which allows for a more realistic model of the long lag between exposure and death. The mobility data gives us a leading indicator that can quickly detect changes in the pandemics local growth rate and forecast changes in death rates weeks ahead of time. This is an analysis of observational data, so any causal interpretations of the models inferences should be treated as suggestive at best; nonetheless, the models inferred relationship between different kinds of trips and the infection rate do suggest some possible hypotheses about what kinds of activities might contribute most to COVID-19s spread.","Liu, L.; Vikram, S.; Lao, J.; Ben, X.; D'amour, A.; O'banion, S.; Sandler, M.; Saurous, R.

24081,Ventilation procedures to minimize the airborne transmission of viruses at schools,"Reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through indoor air is the key challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic. Crowded indoor environments, such as schools, represent possible hotspots for virus transmission since the basic non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures applied so far (e.g. social distancing) do not eliminate the airborne transmission mode. There is widespread consensus that improved ventilation is needed to minimize the transmission potential of airborne viruses in schools, whether through mechanical systems or ad-hoc manual airing procedures in naturally ventilated buildings. However, there remains significant uncertainty surrounding exactly what ventilation rates are required, and how to best achieve these targets with limited time and resources. This paper uses a mass balance approach to quantify the ability of both mechanical ventilation and ad-hoc airing procedures to mitigate airborne transmission risk in the classroom environment. For naturally-ventilated classrooms, we propose a novel feedback control strategy using CO2 concentrations to continuously monitor and adjust the airing procedure. Our case studies show how such procedures can be applied in the real world to support the reopening of schools during the pandemic. Our results also show the inadequacy of relying on absolute CO2 concentration thresholds as the sole indicator of airborne transmission risk.","Stabile, L.; Pacitto, A.; Mikszewski, A.; Morawska, L.; Buonanno, G.",2021-03-24,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.03.23.21254179,1,Luca Stabile,University of Cassino and Southern Lazio,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.23.21254179v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.23.21254179v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

To investigate self-reported discrimination and concern for physical assault due to the COVID-19 pandemic among disaggregated Asian subgroups in the US. Methods. We conducted a nationwide survey to assess self-reported discrimination and concern for physical assault due to COVID-19 across racial/ethnic groups, including diverse subgroups of Asians. Results. Chinese respondents experienced the largest change (15% increase) in proportion of respondents reporting discrimination from 2019 to 2020 (P<.01).

Conclusions. Our study is the first to examine self-reported discrimination and concern for physical assault due to COVID-19 in subgroups of Asian Americans, finding that East (Chinese, Korean, Japanese) and Southeast (Vietnamese, Filipino) Asian Americans have been disproportionately affected. Future studies should disaggregate Asian subgroups to fully understand experiences of discrimination in diverse populations in the US.","Ha, S. K.; Nguyen, A. T.; Sales, C.; Chang, R.

13159,Moving Singing for Lung Health online: experience from a randomised controlled trial,"IntroductionSinging for Lung Health (SLH) is a popular arts-in-health activity for people with long-term respiratory conditions, which participants report provides biopsychosocial benefits, however research on impact is limited. The  SHIELD trial, a randomised controlled, single (assessor) blind, trial of 12 weeks SLH vs usual care for people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (n=120) was set-up to help to address this. The first group started face-to-face (5 sessions) before changing to online delivery (7 sessions) due to COVID-19 related physical distancing measures. As such, the experience of this group is here reported as a pilot study to inform further research in this area.

MethodsWe conducted semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis regarding barriers, facilitators and key considerations regarding transitioning from face-to-face to online delivery. Pilot quantitative outcomes include attendance, pre and post measures of quality of life and disease impact (SF-36, CAT score), breathlessness (MRC breathlessness scale, Dyspnoea-12), depression (PHQ9), anxiety (GAD-7), balance confidence (ABC scale) and physical activity (clinical visit PROactive physical activity in COPD tool, combining subjective rating and actigraphy).

ResultsAttendance was 69% overall, (90% of the face-to-face sessions, 53% online sessions). Analysis of semi-structured interviews identified three themes regarding participation in SLH delivered face-to-face and online, these where 1) perceived benefits; 2) digital barriers (online); 3) digital facilitators (online). Findings were summarised into key considerations for optimising transitioning singing groups from face-to-face to online delivery. Pilot quantitative data suggested possible improvements in depression (treatment effect -4.78, p= 0.0487, MCID 5) balance confidence (treatment effect +17.21, p=0.0383, MCID 14.2), and anxiety (treatment effect -2.22, p=0.0659, MCID 2).

DiscussionThis study identifies key considerations regarding the adaptation of SLH from face-to-face to online delivery. Pilot data suggest online group singing for people with COPD may deliver benefits related to reducing depression and anxiety, and improved balance confidence.

KEY MESSAGESO_ST_ABSWhat is the key question?C_ST_ABSCan Singing for Lung Health (SLH) be delivered online for people with COPD? And if so, what are the practical issues and how does the experience compare with face-to-face participation?

What is the bottom line?SLH appears safe and enjoyable both face-to-face and online. Access barriers for online sessions included digital access and literacy. However increasing access to those previous unable to physically access sessions is also important. In this pilot, depression, anxiety and balance confidence appear to show improvements related to participation in a SLH group that transitioned from face-to-face to online delivery.

Why read on?To our knowledge this is the first study to assess health impacts of online group singing sessions. Given the physical distancing measures required by the response to COVID-19, there is a need for singing groups and other similar interventions to be delivered online such as pulmonary rehabilitation. This study helps to inform this and future research in the area.","Philip, K. E. J.; Lewis, A.; Jeffery, E.; Buttery, S.; Cave, P.; Cristiano, D.; Lound, A.; Taylor, K.; Man, W.

13936,SARS-CoV-2 infections and antibody responses among health care workers in a Spanish hospital after a month of follow-up,"BackgroundAt the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of 578 randomly selected health care workers (HCW) from Hospital Clinic de Barcelona was 11.2%.

MethodsA follow-up survey one month after the baseline (April-May 2020) measured SARS-CoV-2 infection by real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and IgM, IgA, IgG and subclasses to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by Luminex. Prevalence of infection was defined by a positive SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR and/or antibody seropositivity.

ResultsThe cumulative prevalence of infection at month 1 was 14.9% (84/565) and the seroprevalence 14.5% (82/565) for IgM and/or IgG and/or IgA. We found 25 (5%) new infections in participants without previous evidence of infection at baseline (501) and two participants seroreverted for IgM and/or IgG and/or IgA. Among seropositive participants at baseline, IgM and IgA levels generally declined at month 1 (antibody decay rates of 0.49 (95% CI, 0.40-0.60) and 0.34 (95% CI, 0.26-0.44)), respectively. Eight percent of the participants seroreverted for IgM and 11% for IgA. Subjects reporting COVID-19-like symptoms and laboratory and other technicians had higher risk of infection. The most frequent subclass responses were IgG1 and IgG2, followed by IgG3, with higher levels of IgG1, and only IgA1 but no IgA2 was detected.

ConclusionsOur findings highlight the importance of a continuous and improved surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infections in HCW, particularly in high risk groups. The decay of IgA and IgM levels have implications for seroprevalence studies using these isotypes.","Moncunill, G.; Mayor, A.; Santano, R.; Jimenez, A.; Vidal, M.; Tortajada, M.; Sanz, S.; Mendez, S.; Llupia, A.; Aguilar, R.; Alonso, S.; Barrios, D.; Carolis, C.; Cistero, P.; Choliz, E.; Cruz, A.; Fochs, S.; Jairoce, C.; Hecht, J.; Lamoglia, M.; Martinez, M.; Moreno, J.; Mitchell, R.; Ortega, N.; Pey, N.; Puyol, L.; Ribes, M.; Rosell, N.; Sotomayor, P.; Torres, S.; Williams, S.; Barroso, S.; Vilella, A.; Trilla, A.; Varela, P.; Dobano, C.; Garcia-Basteiro, A.

15894,Comparison of infection control strategies to reduce COVID-19 outbreaks in homeless shelters in the United States: a simulation study,"BackgroundCOVID-19 outbreaks have occurred in homeless shelters across the US, highlighting an urgent need to identify the most effective infection control strategy to prevent future outbreaks.

MethodsWe developed a microsimulation model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a homeless shelter and calibrated it to data from cross-sectional polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) surveys conducted during COVID-19 outbreaks in five shelters in three US cities from March 28 to April 10, 2020. We estimated the probability of averting a COVID-19 outbreak when an exposed individual is introduced into a representative homeless shelter of 250 residents and 50 staff over 30 days under different infection control strategies, including daily symptom-based screening, twice-weekly PCR testing and universal mask wearing.

ResultsThe proportion of PCR-positive residents and staff at the shelters with observed outbreaks ranged from 2.6% to 51.6%, which translated to basic reproduction number (R0) estimates of 2.9-6.2. The probability of averting an outbreak diminished with higher transmissibility (R0) within the simulated shelter and increasing incidence in the local community. With moderate community incidence (~30 confirmed cases/1,000,000 people/day), the estimated probabilities of averting an outbreak in a low-risk (R0=1.5), moderate-risk (R0=2.9), and high-risk (R0=6.2) shelter were, respectively: 0.35, 0.13 and 0.04 for daily symptom-based screening; 0.53, 0.20, and 0.09 for twice-weekly PCR testing; 0.62, 0.27 and 0.08 for universal masking; and 0.74, 0.42 and 0.19 for these strategies combined.

ConclusionsIn high-risk homeless shelter environments and locations with high community incidence of COVID-19, even intensive infection control strategies (incorporating daily symptom-screening, frequent PCR testing and universal mask wearing) are unlikely to prevent outbreaks, suggesting a need for non-congregate housing arrangements for people experiencing homelessness. In lower-risk environments, combined interventions should be employed to reduce outbreak risk.","Chapman, L. A. C.; Kushel, M.; Cox, S.

6156,Trends in excess cancer and cardiovascular deaths in Scotland during the COVID-19 pandemic 30 December 2019 to 20 April 2020,"Understanding the trends in causes of death for different diseases during the current COVID-19 pandemic is important to determine whether there are excess deaths beyond what is normally expected. Using the most recent report from National Records Scotland (NRS) on 29 April 2020, we examined the percentage difference in crude numbers of deaths in 2020 compared to the average for 2015-2019 by week of death within calendar year. To determine if trends were similar, suggesting underreporting/underdiagnosed COVID-19 related deaths, we also looked at the trends in % differences for cardiovascular disease deaths. From the first 17 weeks of data, we found a peak in excess deaths at week 14 of 2020, about four weeks after the first case in Scotland was detected on 1 March 2020-- but by week 17 these excesses had returned to normal levels, 4 weeks after lockdown in the UK began. Similar observations were seen for cardiovascular disease-related deaths. These observations suggest that the short-term increase in excess cancer and cardiovascular deaths might be associated with undetected/unconfirmed deaths related to COVID-19. Both of these conditions make patients more susceptible to infection and lack of widespread access to testing for COVID-19 are likely to have resulted in under-estimation of COVID-19 mortality. These data further suggest that the cumulative toll of COVID-19 on mortality is likely undercounted. More detailed analysis is needed to determine if these excesses were directly or indirectly related to COVID-19. Disease specific mortality will need constant monitoring for the foreseeable future as changes occur in increasing capacity and access to testing, reporting criteria, changes to health services and different measures are implemented to control the spread of the COVID-19. Multidisciplinary, multi-institutional, national and international collaborations for complementary and population specific data analysis is required to respond and mitigate adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and to inform planning for future pandemics.","Figueroa, J.; Brennan, P.; Theodoratou, E.; Poon, M.; Purshouse, K.; Din, F.; Jin, K.; Mesa-Eguiagaray, I.; Dunlop, M.

19590,COVID-19 PREDICTION IN SOUTH AFRICA: ESTIMATING THE UNASCERTAINED CASES- THE HIDDEN PART OF THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL ICEBERG,"Understanding the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions as well as acscounting for the unascertained cases remain critical challenges for epidemiological models for understanding the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 spread. In this paper, we propose a new epidemiological model (eSEIRD) that extends the widely used epidemiological models such as extended Susceptible-Infected-Removed model (eSIR) and SAPHIRE (initially developed and used for analyzing data from Wuhan). We fit these models to the daily ascertained infected (and removed) cases from March 15, 2020 to Dec 31, 2020 in South Africa that reported the largest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths from the WHO African region. Using the eSEIRD model, the COVID-19 transmission dynamics in South Africa was characterized by the estimated basic reproduction number (R0) starting at 3.22 (95%CrI: [3.19, 3.23]) then dropping below 2 following a mandatory lockdown implementation and subsequently increasing to 3.27 (95%CrI: [3.27, 3.27]) by the end of 2020. The initial decrease of effective reproduction number followed by an increase suggest the effectiveness of early interventions and the combined effect of relaxing strict interventions and emergence of a new coronavirus variant in South Africa. The low estimated ascertainment rate was found to vary from 1.65% to 9.17% across models and time periods. The overall infection fatality ratio (IFR) was estimated as 0.06% (95%CrI: [0.04%, 0.22%]) accounting for unascertained cases and deaths while the reported case fatality ratio was 2.88% (95% CrI: [2.45%, 6.01%]). The models predict that from December 31, 2020, to April 1, 2021, the predicted cumulative number of infected would reach roughly 70% of total population in South Africa. Besides providing insights on the COVID-19 dynamics in South Africa, we develop powerful forecasting tools that enable estimation of ascertainment rates and IFR while quantifying the effect of intervention measures on COVID-19 spread.

13684,Real-time spatial health surveillance: mapping the UK COVID-19 epidemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for robust data linkage systems and methods for identifying outbreaks of disease in near real-time. Using self-reported app data and the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank, we demonstrate the use of sophisticated spatial modelling for near-real-time prediction of COVID-19 prevalence at small-area resolution to inform strategic government policy areas. A pre-requisite to an effective control strategy is that predictions need to be accompanied by estimates of their precision, to guard against over-reaction to potentially spurious features of  best guess predictions. In the UK, important emerging risk-factors such as social deprivation or ethnicity vary over small distances, hence risk needs to be modelled at fine spatial resolution to avoid aggregation bias. We demonstrate that existing geospatial statistical methods originally developed for global health applications are well-suited to this task and can be used in an anonymised databank environment, thus preserving the privacy of the individuals who contribute their data.","Fry, R.; Hollinghurst, J.; Stagg, H.

23601,"Prediction of severe COVID-19 cases requiring a ventilator in Tokyo, Japan","BackgroundTo avoid exhaustion of medical resources by COVID-19, policy-makers must predict care needs, specifically the proportion of severe cases likely to need ventilator care.

ObjectiveThis study was designed to use a statistical model to elucidate dynamics of severe cases in Tokyo and to discuss the timing of effective policy activation.

MethodsThe study extended from April 27 through October 18, 2020 in Japans Tokyo Metropolitan area. Medical exhaustion was defined as use of more than half of the ventilator capacity available before the COVID-19 outbreak. We regressed the number of severe cases on the newly onset patients of more than 14 days prior. As earlier research indicated, the COVID-19 severity changed at the end of May. Therefore, we added dummy variables to reflect changing severity from June and its product with newly onset patients as the explanatory variable. Then we calculated the threshold using R(t): R(t)=0.99 for the number of patients 14 days prior was used as a threshold at which strong countermeasures should be activated to keep to avoid medical exhaustion.

ResultsThe critical number signaling medical exhaustion in Tokyo was defined as 655 cases. We selected 15, 30, 60 and 90 days prior as explanatory variables for explaining the number of severe cases. A coefficient of determination larger than 0.95 was inferred as indicating good fit. The threshold was estimated as more than 4500 cases for R(t)=1.1 and monotonically decreasing by R(t) to be 600 cases for R(t)=2.5.

Discussion and ConclusionResults showed that newly onset patients reported more than 14 days prior can explain the number of severe cases very well. We also confirmed the threshold number of patients 14 days prior by R(t) for which strong countermeasures should be activated to avoid medical exhaustion with R(t)=0.99. This method is expected to be useful for countermeasure activation policies for Tokyo.","Kurita, J.; Sugawara, T.; Ohksa, Y.",2021-03-12,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.03.11.21253431,1,Junko Kurita,"Tokiwa University, Ibaraki, Japan",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.11.21253431v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.11.21253431v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

Here, we address this problem and explain the appearance of these patterns. We start with an empirical study of an original dataset obtained from highly precise measurements of SARS-Cov-2 concentration in wastewater over nine months in several treatment plants around the Thau lagoon in France. Among various features, we observe that the concentration displays plateaus at different dates in various locations but at the same level. In order to understand these facts, we introduce a new mathematical model that takes into account the heterogeneity and the natural variability of individual behaviours. Our model shows that the distribution of risky behaviours appears as the key ingredient for understanding the observed temporal patterns of the epidemics.","Berestycki, H.; Desjardins, B.; Heintz, B.; Oury, J.-M.",2021-04-16,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.03.26.21254414,2,Henri Berestycki,Ecole des hautes etudes en sciences sociales,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.26.21254414v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.26.21254414v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

13402,"Double-zero-event studies matter: a re-evaluation of physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection for preventing person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 and its policy impact","ObjectivesHigh-quality meta-analyses on COVID-19 are in urgent demand for evidence-based decision making. However, conventional approaches exclude double-zero-event studies (DZS) from meta-analyses. We assessed whether including such studies impacts the conclusions in a recent systematic urgent review on prevention measures for preventing person-to-person transmission of COVID-19.

Study designs and settingsWe extracted data for meta-analyses containing DZS from a recent review that assessed the effects of physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection for preventing person-to-person transmission. A bivariate generalized linear mixed model was used to re-do the meta-analyses with DZS included. We compared the synthesized relative risks (RRs) of the three prevention measures, their 95% confidence intervals (CI), and significance tests (at the level of 0.05) including and excluding DZS.

ResultsThe re-analyzed COVID-19 data containing DZS involved a total of 1,784 participants who were not considered in the original review. Including DZS noticeably changed the synthesized RRs and 95% CIs of several interventions. For the meta-analysis of the effect of physical distancing, the RR of COVID-19 decreased from 0.15 (95% CI, 0.03 to 0.73) to 0.07 (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.98). For several meta-analyses, the statistical significance of the synthesized RR was changed. The RR of eye protection with a physical distance of 2 m and the RR of physical distancing when using N95 respirators were no longer statistically significant after including DZS.

ConclusionsDZS may contain useful information. Sensitivity analyses that include DZS in meta-analysis are recommended.","Xiao, M.; Lin, L.; Hodges, J.

We then tested if rare pLOF variants in these 13 genes were associated with severe COVID-19. We identified only one rare pLOF mutation across these genes amongst 713 cases with severe COVID-19 and observed no enrichment of pLOFs in severe cases compared to population controls or mild COVID-19 cases.

3028,Severe airport sanitarian control could slow down the spreading of COVID-19 pandemics in Brazil,"BackgroundWe investigated a likely scenario of COVID-19 spreading in Brazil through the complex airport network of the country, for the 90 days after the first national occurrence of the disease. After the confirmation of the first imported cases, the lack of a proper airport entrance control resulted in the infection spreading in a manner directly proportional to the amount of flights reaching each city, following first occurrence of the virus coming from abroad.

MethodologyWe developed a SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model divided in a metapopulation structure, where cities with airports were demes connected by the number of flights. Subsequently, we further explored the role of Manaus airport for a rapid entrance of the pandemic into indigenous territories situated in remote places of the Amazon region.

ResultsThe expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus between cities was fast, directly proportional to the airport closeness centrality within the Brazilian air transportation network. There was a clear pattern in the expansion of the pandemic, with a stiff exponential expansion of cases for all cities. The more an airport showed closeness centrality, the greater was its vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2.

ConclusionsWe discussed the weak pandemic control performance of Brazil in comparison with other tropical, developing countries, namely India and Nigeria. Finally, we proposed measures for containing virus spreading taking into consideration the scenario of high poverty.","Ribeiro, S. P.; Dattilo, W.; Castro E Silva, A.; Reis, A.

2249,Case fatality risk of novel coronavirus diseases 2019 in China,"ObjectiveThe outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) imposed a substantial health burden in mainland China and remains a global epidemic threat. Our objectives are to assess the case fatality risk (CFR) among COVID-19 patients detected in mainland China, stratified by clinical category and age group.

MethodsWe collected individual information on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases from publicly available official sources from December 29, 2019 to February 23, 2020. We explored the risk factors associated with mortality. We used methods accounting for right-censoring and survival analyses to estimate the CFR among detected cases.

ResultsOf 12,863 cases reported outside Hubei, we obtained individual records for 9,651 cases, including 62 deaths and 1,449 discharged cases. The deceased were significantly older than discharged cases (median age: 77 vs 39 years, p<0.001). 58% (36/62) were male. Older age (OR 1.18 per year; 95%CI: 1.14 to 1.22), being male (OR 2.02; 95%CI: 1.02 to 4.03), and being treated in less developed economic regions (e.g., West and Northeast vs. East, OR 3.93; 95%CI: 1.74 to 8.85) were mortality risk factors. The estimated CFR was 0.89-1.24% among all cases. The fatality risk among critical patients was 2-fold higher than that among severe and critical patients, and 24-fold higher than that among moderate, severe and critical patients.

ConclusionsOur estimates of CFR based on laboratory-confirmed cases ascertained outside of Hubei suggest that COVID-19 is not as severe as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but more similar to the mortality risk of 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in hospitalized patients. The fatality risk of COVID-19 is higher in males and increases with age. Our study improves the severity assessment of the ongoing epidemic and can inform the COVID-19 outbreak response in China and beyond.","Deng, X.; Yang, J.; Wang, W.; Wang, X.; Zhou, J.; Chen, Z.; Li, J.; Chen, Y.; Yan, H.; Zhang, J.; Zhang, Y.; Wang, Y.; Qiu, Q.; Gong, H.; Wei, X.; Wang, L.; Sun, K.; Wu, P.; Ajelli, M.; Cowling, B.

We assessed mental health with the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), and with the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D-10). We measured experiences of discrimination with a battery of questions that asked respondents whether they had experienced a set of discriminatory experiences because of their LGBTQ+ identity during the coronavirus pandemic. Experiences of discrimination was considered a mediating factor and examined both as an outcome as well as an explanatory variable. Models were adjusted for a range of demographic and socioeconomic variables.

ResultsThe prevalence of depression and stress were both high, with the majority of the sample exhibiting significant depressive symptomology (69%). Around one-in-six respondents reported some form of discrimination since the start of the pandemic because they were LGBTQ+ (16.7%). In regression models, the average score for perceived stress increased by 1.44 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.517-2.354) for those who had experienced an instance of homophobic or transphobic harassment, compared to respondents who had not. Similarly, the odds of exhibiting significant depressive symptomology (CES-D-10 scores of 10 or more) increased three-fold among those who had experienced harassment based on their gender or sexuality compared to those who had not (OR: 3.251; 95% CI: 1.168-9.052). These marked associations remained after adjustment for a number of socioeconomic and demographic covariates. Cis-female respondents who identify as gay or lesbian had the lowest scores for perceived social or depressive symptoms; conversely transgender and gender diverse individuals had the highest scores.

ConclusionsWe found high levels of stress and depressive symptoms, particularly among younger and transgender and gender diverse respondents. These associations were partially explained by experiences of discrimination which had a large, consistent and pernicious impact on stress and mental health.","Kneale, D.; Becares, L.",2020-08-04,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.08.03.20167403,1,Laia Becares,University of Sussex,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.03.20167403v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.03.20167403v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
19475,Antibody landscape against SARS-CoV-2 proteome revealed significant differences between non-structural/ accessory proteins and structural proteins,"The immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 proteome is largely unknown, especially for non-structural proteins and accessory proteins. Here we collected 2,360 COVID-19 sera and 601 control sera. We analyzed these sera on a protein microarray with 20 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, built an antibody response landscape for IgG and IgM. We found that non-structural proteins and accessory proteins NSP1, NSP7, NSP8, RdRp, ORF3b and ORF9b elicit prevalent IgG responses. The IgG patterns and dynamic of non-structural/ accessory proteins are different from that of S and N protein. The IgG responses against these 6 proteins are associated with disease severity and clinical outcome and declined sharply about 20 days after symptom onset. In non-survivors, sharp decrease of IgG antibodies against S1 and N protein before death was observed. The global antibody responses to non-structural/ accessory proteins revealed here may facilitate deeper understanding of SARS-CoV-2 immunology.

HighlightsO_LIAn antibody response landscape against SARS-CoV-2 proteome was constructed

10488,Clinical course and potential predictive factors for pneumonia of adult patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): a retrospective observational analysis of 193 confirmed cases in Thailand,"BackgroundClinical spectrum of COVID-19 has been unclear, especially with regard to the presence of pneumonia. We aimed to present clinical course of all laboratory-confirmed adult COVID-19 patients and to identify potential predicting factors of pneumonia.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective study among adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Thailand, regardless of their disease severity, between January 8 and April 16, 2020. We described the full picture of COVID-19, defined definite outcomes and evaluated factors associated with pneumonia.

ResultsOne-hundred-and-ninety-three patients were included. The median (IQR) age was 37.0 (29.0-53.0) years, and 58.5% were male. Of whom, 189 (97.9%) recovered and 4 (2.1%) died. More than half (56%) of the patients were mild, 22% were moderate, 14% were severe, and 3% were critically ill. Asymptomatic infection was found in 5%. The overall incidence of pneumonia was 39%. Bilateral was more prevalent than unilateral pneumonia (65% vs. 35%). Increasing age (OR 2.60 for every 10-year increase from 30 years old; 95% CI, 1.68 to 3.97; p<0.001), obesity (OR 9.17; 95% CI, 2.11 to 39.89; p=0.003), and higher temperature at presentation (OR 4.66 per one-degree Celsius increase from 37.2 degree Celsius; 95% CI, 2.32 to 9.34; p<0.001) were potential predicting factors of COVID-19 pneumonia. Severe cases had a longer viral RNA shedding duration than the non-severe cases. The longest observed duration of viral RNA shedding was 45 days.

ConclusionAcross different disease severities, most patients with COVID-19 in Thailand had a good prognosis. COVID-19 pneumonia was found in one-third of the hospitalized patients.

Potential predicting factors included old age, obesity, fever at presentation.","Pongpirul, W.

The study investigates the prevalence and predictors of general psychiatric disorders measured by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and frequency of loneliness during COVID-19 in the United Kingdom, a country heavily hit by the pandemic. We analyzed 15,530 respondents of the first large-scale, nationally representative survey of COVID-19 in a developed country, the first wave of Understanding Society COVID-19 Study. Results show that 29.2% of the respondents score 4 or more, the caseness threshold, on the general psychiatric disorder measure, and 35.86% of the respondents sometimes or often feel lonely. Regression analyses show that those who have or had COVID-19-related symptoms are more likely to develop general psychiatric disorders and are lonelier. Women and people in their 20s have higher risks of general psychiatric disorders and loneliness, while having a job and living with a partner are protective factors. This study showcases the general psychiatric disorders and loneliness of broader members of the society during COVID-19 and the underlying social disparities.","Li, L.

MethodsThis was a prospective single health system observational cohort study of patients [&ge;]18 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 disease who required at least 6 liters of oxygen during admission, had intact baseline cognitive and functional status and were discharged alive. Participants were enrolled between 30 and 40 days after discharge. Outcomes were elicited through validated survey instruments: the PROMIS(R) Dyspnea Characteristics and PROMIS(R) Global Health-10.

ResultsA total of 161 patients (40.6% of eligible) were enrolled; 152 (38.3%) completed the survey. Median age was 62 years (interquartile range [IQR], 50-67); 57 (37%) were female. Overall, 113/152 (74%) participants reported shortness of breath within the prior week (median score 3 out of 10 [IQR 0-5]), vs. 47/152 (31%) pre-COVID-19 infection (0, IQR 0-1), p<0.001. Participants also rated their physical health and mental health as worse in their post-COVID state (43.8, standard deviation 9.3; mental health 47.3, SD 9.3) compared to their pre-COVID state, (54.3, SD 9.3; 54.3, SD 7.8, respectively), both p <0.001. A total of 52/148 (35.1%) patients without pre-COVID oxygen requirements needed home oxygen after hospital discharge; 20/148 (13.5%) reported still using oxygen at time of survey.

19110,A Bayesian Susceptible-Infectious-Hospitalized-Ventilated-Recovered Model to Predict Demand for COVID-19 Inpatient Care in a Large Healthcare System,"The COVID-19 pandemic strained healthcare systems in many parts of the United States. During the early months of the pandemic, there was substantial uncertainty about whether the large number of COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization would exceed healthcare system capacity. This uncertainty created an urgent need for accurate predictions about the number of COVID-19 patients requiring inpatient and ventilator care at the local level. In this work, we develop a Bayesian Susceptible-Infectious-Hospitalized-Ventilated-Recovered (SIHVR) model to predict the burden of COVID-19 at the healthcare system level. The Bayesian SIHVR model provides daily estimates of the number of new COVID-19 patients admitted to inpatient care, the total number of non-ventilated COVID-19 inpatients, and the total number of ventilated COVID-19 patients at the healthcare system level. The model also incorporates county-level data on the number of reported COVID-19 cases, and county-level social distancing metrics, making it locally customizable. The uncertainty in model predictions is quantified with 95% credible intervals. The Bayesian SIHVR model is validated with an extensive simulation study, and then applied to data from two regional healthcare systems in South Carolina. This model can be adapted for other healthcare systems to estimate local resource needs.","Self, S. C. W.; Huang, R.; Amin, S.; Ewing, J.

5789,Comparison of the Clinical Implications among Two Different Nutritional Indices in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease.It was first reported in Wuhan, China, and then broke out on a large scale around the world.This study aimed to assess the clinical significance of two different nutritional indices in 245 patients with COVID-19.

MethodsIn this retrospective single-center study, we finally included 245 consecutive patients who confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital from January 1 to February 29. Cases were classified as either discharged or dead. Demographic, clinical and laboratory datas were registered, two different nutritional indices were calculated: (i)the Controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score; (ii) prognostic nutritional index (PNI). We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to explore the relationship between nutritional indices and hospital death.

Results212 of them were discharged and 33 of them died. In-hospital mortality was signifcantly higher in the severe group of PNI than in the moderate and normal groups. It was also significantly worse in the severe-CONUT group than in the moderate-, mild-, and normal-CONUT groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the CONUT score (odds ratio3.371,95%CI (1.124-10.106), p = 0.030) and PNI(odds ratio 0.721,95% CI (0.581-0.896), P=0.003) were independent predictors of all-cause death at an early stage; Multivariate logistic regression analysis also showed that the severe group of PNI was the independent risk predictor of in-hospital death(odds ratio 24.225, 95% CI(2.147-273.327), p=0.010).The CONUT score cutoff value was 5.5 (56.00 and 80.81%; AUC 0.753; 95% CI (0.644-0.862); respectively). The PNI cutoff value was 40.58 (81.80 and 66.20%; AUC 0.778; 95% CI (0.686-0.809); respectively). We use PNI and the COUNT score to assess malnutrition, which can have a prognosis effect of COVID-19patients.

A significant increase in circulating plasmablasts is characteristic of COVID-19 though the underlying mechanisms and its prognostic implications are not known. Here, we demonstrate that in the acute phase of COVID-19, activated PD-1highCXCR5-CD4+ T cells, peripheral helper T cells, (Tph) are significantly increased and promote inflammatory tissue-homing plasmablasts in patients with stable but not severe COVID-19. Analysis of scRNA-seq data revealed that plasmablasts in stable patients express higher levels of tissue-homing receptors including CXCR3. The increased Tph cells exhibited """"B cell help"""" signatures similar to that of circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells and promoted B cell differentiation in vitro. Compared with cTfh cells, Tph cells produced more IFN{gamma}, inducing tissue-homing chemokine receptors on plasmablasts. Finally, expansion of activated Tph cells was correlated with the frequency of CXCR3+ plasmablasts in the acute phase of patients with stable disease. Our results demonstrate a novel role for Tph cells in acute viral immunity by inducing ectopic, antibody secreting plasmablasts.","Asashima, H.; Mohanty, S.; Comi, M.; Ruff, W. E.; Hoehn, K.

8715,SARS-CoV-2 in environmental samples of quarantined households,"The role of environmental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. Particularly the close contact of persons living together or cohabitating in domestic quarantine could result in high risk for exposure to the virus within the households. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the whereabouts of the virus and whether useful precautions to prevent the dissemination can be given.

21 households under quarantine conditions were randomly selected for this study. All persons living in each household were recorded in terms of age, sex and time of household quarantine. Throat swabs for analysis were obtained from all adult individuals and most of the children. Air, wastewater samples and surface swabs (commodities) were obtained and analysed by RT- PCR. Positive swabs were cultivated to analyse for viral infectivity.

26 of all 43 tested adults (60.47 %) tested positive by RT-PCR. All 15 air samples were PCR- negative. 10 of 66 wastewater samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (15.15 %) as well as 4 of 119 object samples (3.36 %). No statistically significant correlation between PCR-positive environmental samples and the extent of infection spread inside the household could be observed. No infectious virus could be isolated under cell culture conditions.

As we cannot rule out transmission through surfaces, hygienic behavioural measures are important in the households of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals to avoid potential transmission through surfaces. The role of the domestic environment, in particular the wastewater load in washbasins and showers, in the transmission of SARS CoV-2 should be further clarified.

HighlightsO_LIWith public """"shut downs"""" due to SARS-CoV-2, domestic infection is a main possible route of transmission.

Emerging evidence has shown that exosomal miRNAs are functionally involved in a number of physiologic and pathologic processes. However, neither exosomes nor miRNAs have been hitherto investigated in COVID-19. To test the hypothesis that exosomal miRNAs are a key determinant of thrombosis in COVID-19, we enrolled patients positive for COVID-19. Circulating exosomes were isolated from equal amounts of serum and levels of exosomal miRNAs were quantified. We divided our population in two groups based on the serum level of D-dimer on admission. Strikingly, we found that exosomal miR-424 was significantly upregulated whereas exosomal miR-103a, miR-145, and miR-885 were significantly downregulated in patients in the high D-dimer group compared to patients in the low D-Dimer group (p<0.0001).","Gambardella, J.; Sardu, C.; Morelli, M.

23852,"Within-country age-based prioritisation, global allocation, and public health impact of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: a mathematical modelling analysis","The worldwide endeavour to develop safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines has been extraordinary, and vaccination is now underway in many countries. However, the doses available in 2021 are likely to be limited. We extended a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission across different country settings to evaluate the public health impact of potential vaccines using WHO-developed target product profiles. We identified optimal vaccine allocation strategies within- and between-countries to maximise averted deaths under constraints on dose supply. We found that the health impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination depends on the cumulative population-level infection incidence when vaccination begins, the duration of natural immunity, the trajectory of the epidemic prior to vaccination, and the level of healthcare available to effectively treat those with disease. Within a country we find that for a limited supply (doses for <20% of the population) the optimal strategy is to target the elderly. However, with a larger supply, if vaccination can occur while other interventions are maintained, the optimal strategy switches to targeting key transmitters to indirectly protect the vulnerable. As supply increases, vaccines that reduce or block infection have a greater impact than those that prevent disease alone due to the indirect protection provided to high-risk groups. Given a 2 billion global dose supply in 2021, we find that a strategy in which doses are allocated to countries proportional to population size is close to optimal in averting deaths and aligns with the ethical principles agreed in pandemic preparedness planning.

HighlightsO_LIThe global dose supply of COVID-19 vaccines will be constrained in 2021
C_LIO_LIWithin a country, prioritising doses to protect those at highest mortality risk is efficient
C_LIO_LIFor a 2 billion dose supply in 2021, allocating to countries according to population size is efficient and equitable

14377,A neutrophil activation signature predicts critical illness and mortality in COVID-19,"Pathologic immune hyperactivation is emerging as a key feature of critical illness in COVID-19, but the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. We carried out proteomic profiling of plasma from cross-sectional and longitudinal cohorts of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and analyzed clinical data from our health system database of over 3,300 patients. Using a machine learning algorithm, we identified a prominent signature of neutrophil activation, including resistin, lipocalin-2, HGF, IL-8, and G-CSF, as the strongest predictors of critical illness. Neutrophil activation was present on the first day of hospitalization in patients who would only later require transfer to the intensive care unit, thus preceding the onset of critical illness and predicting increased mortality. In the health system database, early elevations in developing and mature neutrophil counts also predicted higher mortality rates. Altogether, we define an essential role for neutrophil activation in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and identify molecular neutrophil markers that distinguish patients at risk of future clinical decompensation.","Meizlish, M.

24104,"A small number of early introductions seeded widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Quebec, Canada","Using genomic epidemiology, we investigated the arrival of SARS-CoV-2 to Quebec, the Canadian province most impacted by COVID-19, with >280,000 positive cases and >10,000 deaths in a population of 8.5 million as of March 1st, 2021. We report 2,921 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the context of >12,000 publicly available genomes sampled globally over the first pandemic wave (up to June 1st, 2020). By combining phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses with epidemiological data, we quantify the number of introduction events into Quebec, identify their origins, and characterize the spatio-temporal spread of the virus. Conservatively, we estimated at least 500 independent introduction events, the majority of which happened from spring break until two weeks after the Canadian border closed for non-essential travel. Subsequent mass repatriations did not generate large transmission lineages (>50 cases), likely due to mandatory quarantine measures in place at the time. Consistent with common spring break and  snowbird destinations, most of the introductions were inferred to have originated from Europe via the Americas. Fewer than 100 viral introductions arrived during spring break, of which 5-10 led to the largest transmission lineages of the first wave (accounting for 36-58% of all sequenced infections). These successful viral transmission lineages dispersed widely across the province, consistent with founder effects and superspreading dynamics. Transmission lineage size was greatly reduced after March 11th, when a quarantine order for returning travelers was enacted. While this suggests the effectiveness of early public health measures, the biggest transmission lineages had already been ignited prior to this order. Combined, our results reinforce how, in the absence of tight travel restrictions or quarantine measures, fewer than 100 viral introductions in a week can ensure the establishment of extended transmission chains.","Murall, C.

4921,Why does COVID-19 case fatality rate vary among countries?,"BackgroundWhile the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 is spreading worldwide, there is much concern over the mortality rate that the infection induces. Available data suggest that COVID-19 case fatality rate varies temporally (as the epidemic progresses) and spatially (among countries). Here, we attempted to identify key factors possibly explaining the variability in case fatality rate across countries.

MethodsWe used data on the temporal trajectory of case fatality rate provided by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, and country-specific data on different metrics describing the incidence of known comorbidity factors associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality at the individual level (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation). We also compiled data on demography, economy and political regimes for each country.

FindingsWe first showed that temporal trajectories of case fatality rate greatly vary among countries. We found no evidence for association between comorbidities and case fatality rate at the country level. Case fatality rate was negatively associated with number of hospital beds x1,000 inhabitants. We also report evidence suggesting an association between case fatality rate and the political regime, with democracies suffering from the highest mortality burden, compared to autocratic regimes. However, most of the among-country variance in case fatality rate remained unexplained.

InterpretationOverall, these results emphasize the role of socio-economic and political factors as possible drivers of COVID-19 case fatality rate at the country level.

15807,Base Reproduction Number of COVID-19: Statistic Analysis,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has grown up to be a pandemic within a short span of time. The quantification of COVID-19 transmissibility is desired for purposes of assessing the potential for a place to start an outbreak and the extent of transmission in the absence of control measures. It is well known that the transmissibility can be measured by reproduction number. For this reason, the large amount of research focuses on the estimations of reproduction number of COVID-19. However, these previous results are controversial and even misleading. To alleviate this problem, Liu et al advised to use averaging technique. Unfortunately, the fluctuant consequence principally arises from data error or model limitations rather than stochastic noise, where the averaging technique doesnt work well. The most likely estimation in USA and Wuhan is about 8.21 and 7.9. However, no enough evidence demonstrates the transmissibility increase of infectious agent of COVID-19 throughout the world.","Zhu, H.; Huang, J.; Liu, X.",2020-09-28,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.26.20202010,1,Hongjun Zhu,Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.26.20202010v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.26.20202010v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
2752,"A Tool to Early Predict Severe 2019-Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (COVID-19) : A Multicenter Study using the Risk Nomogram in Wuhan and Guangdong, China","BackgroundDue to no reliable risk stratification tool for severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients at admission, we aimed to construct an effective model for early identifying cases at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19.

MethodsIn this retrospective three-centers study, 372 non-severe COVID-19 patients during hospitalization were followed for more than 15 days after admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and patients who kept non-severe state were assigned to the severe and non-severe group, respectively. Based on baseline data of the two groups, we constructed a risk prediction nomogram for severe COVID-19 and evaluate its performance.

ResultsThe train cohort consisted of 189 patients, while the two independent validation cohorts consisted of 165 and 18 patients. Among all cases, 72 (19.35%) patients developed severe COVID-19. We found that old age, and higher serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, the coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width, blood urea nitrogen, direct bilirubin, lower albumin, are associated with severe COVID-19. We generated the nomogram for early identifying severe COVID-19 in the train cohort (AUC 0.912 [95% CI 0.846-0.978], sensitivity 85.71%, specificity 87.58%); in validation cohort (0.853 [0.790-0.916], 77.5%, 78.4%). The calibration curve for probability of severe COVID-19 showed optimal agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation. Decision curve and clinical impact curve analysis indicated that nomogram conferred high clinical net benefit.

ConclusionOur nomogram could help clinicians to early identify patients who will exacerbate to severe COVID-19, which will enable better centralized management and early treatment of severe patients.

SummaryOlder age; higher LDH, CRP, RDW, DBIL, BUN; lower ALB on admission correlated with higher odds of severe COVID-19. An effective prognostic nomogram composed of 7 features could allow early identification of patients at risk of exacerbation to severe COVID-19.","Gong, J.; Ou, J.; Qiu, X.; Jie, Y.; Chen, Y.; Yuan, L.; Cao, J.; Tan, M.; Xu, W.; Zheng, F.; Shi, Y.; Hu, B.",2020-04-22,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.03.17.20037515,2,Bo Hu,Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037515v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037515v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1093/cid/ciaa443
15170,Dual Attention Multiple Instance Learning with Unsupervised Complementary Loss for COVID-19 Screening,"Chest computed tomography (CT) based analysis and diagnosis of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) plays a key role in combating the outbreak of the pandemic that has rapidly spread worldwide. To date, the disease has infected more than 18 million people with over 690k deaths reported. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) is the current gold standard for clinical diagnosis but may produce false positives; thus, chest CT based diagnosis is considered more viable. However, accurate screening is challenging due to difficulty in annotation efforts of infected areas, curation of large datasets, and the slight discrepancies between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia. In this study, we propose an attention-based end-to-end weakly supervised framework for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia based on multiple instance learning (MIL). We further incorporate unsupervised contrastive learning for improved accuracy with attention applied both in spatial and latent contexts, herein we propose Dual Attention Contrastive based MIL (DA-CMIL). DA-CMIL takes as input a several patient CT slices (considered as a bag of instances) and outputs a single label. Attention based pooling is applied to implicitly select key slices in latent space, and spatial attention learns slice spatial context for interpretable diagnosis. A contrastive loss is applied at the instance level to encode similarity in features from the same patient against pooled patient features. Empirical results show our algorithm achieves an overall accuracy of 98.6% and an AUC of 98.4%. Moreover, ablation studies show the benefit of contrastive learning with MIL.","Chikontwe, P.; Luna, M.; Kang, M.; Hong, K. S.; Ahn, J. H.; Park, S.

4415,Evaluation of lockdown impact on SARS-CoV-2 dynamics through viral genome quantification in Paris wastewaters,"SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of COVID-19. Most of SARS-CoV-2 carriers are assumed to exhibit no or mild non-specific symptoms. Thus, they may contribute to the rapid and mostly silent circulation of the virus among humans. Since SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples it has recently been proposed to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters (WW) as a complementary tool to investigate virus circulation in human populations. In the present work we assumed that the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters should correlate with the number of symptomatic or non-symptomatic carriers. To test this hypothesis, we performed a time-course quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR in raw wastewater samples collected from several major wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of the Parisian area. The study was conducted from 5 March to 23 April 2020, therefore including the lockdown period in France (since 17 March 2020). We confirmed that the increase of genome units in raw wastewaters accurately followed the increase of human COVID-19 cases observed at the regional level. Of note, the viral genomes could be detected before the beginning of the exponential growth of the epidemic. As importantly, a marked decrease in the quantities of genomes units was observed concomitantly with the reduction in the number of new COVID-19 cases which was an expected consequence of the lockdown. A s a conclusion, this work suggests that a quantitative monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters should bring important and additional information for an improved survey of SARS-CoV-2 circulation at the local or regional scale.","Wurtzer, S.; Marechal, V.; Mouchel, J.-M.; Maday, Y.; Teyssou, R.; Richard, E.; Almayrac, J.

19686,Assessing Durability of Vaccine Effect Following Blinded Crossover in COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacy Trials,"BackgroundSeveral candidate vaccines to prevent COVID-19 disease have entered large-scale phase 3 placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials and some have demonstrated substantial short-term efficacy. Efficacious vaccines should, at some point, be offered to placebo participants, which will occur before long-term efficacy and safety are known.

MethodsFollowing vaccination of the placebo group, we show that placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy can be derived by assuming the benefit of vaccination over time has the same profile for the original vaccine recipients and the placebo crossovers. This reconstruction allows estimation of both vaccine durability and potential vaccine-associated enhanced disease.

ResultsPost-crossover estimates of vaccine efficacy can provide insights about durability, identify waning efficacy, and identify late enhancement of disease, but are less reliable estimates than those obtained by a standard trial where the placebo cohort is maintained. As vaccine efficacy estimates for post-crossover periods depend on prior vaccine efficacy estimates, longer pre-crossover periods with higher case counts provide better estimates of late vaccine efficacy. Further, open-label crossover may lead to riskier behavior in the immediate crossover period for the unblinded vaccine arm, confounding vaccine efficacy estimates for all post-crossover periods.

ConclusionsWe advocate blinded crossover and continued follow-up of trial participants to best assess vaccine durability and potential delayed enhancement of disease. This approach allows placebo recipients timely access to the vaccine when it would no longer be proper to maintain participants on placebo, yet still allows important insights about immunological and clinical effectiveness over time.","Follmann, D.; Fintzi, J.; Fay, M.

24489,Detection of cross-reactive IgA in saliva against SARS-CoV-2 Spike1 subunit,"Abundant secretory IgA (sIgA) in mucus, breast milk, and saliva provides immunity that prevents infection of mucosal surfaces. sIgA in pre-pandemic breast milk samples have been reported to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2, but whether it also occurs in saliva and, if so, whether it cross-reacts with SARS-CoV-2, has remained unknown. We aimed to clarify whether sIgA in saliva cross-reacts with SARS-CoV-2 spike 1 subunit in individuals who have not been infected with this virus. The study included 137 (male, n = 101; female, n = 36; mean age, 38.7 [24-65] years) of dentists and doctors in the Kanagawa Dental University Hospital. Saliva and blood samples were analyzed by PCR and immunochromatography for IgG and IgM, respectively. We then identified patients with saliva samples that were confirmed as PCR- and IgM-negative for COVID-19. Proportions of SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive IgA-positive individuals were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a biotin-labeled spike S1-mFc recombinant protein covering the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive IgA-positive individuals was 46.7%, and this correlated negatively with age (r = -0.218, p = 0.01). The proportion of IgA-positive individuals [&le;] 50 y was significantly lower than that of patients aged [&ge;] 49 y (p = 0.008). sIgA was purified from the saliva of all patients, and the salivary sIgA was found to suppress the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the ACE-2 receptor. We found SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive sIgA in the saliva of some participants who had never been infected with the virus, suggesting that sIgA helps prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Tsukinoki, K.; Yamamoto, T.; Handa, K.; Iwamiya, M.; Saruta, J.; Ino, S.; Sakurai, T.",2021-04-02,Dentistry And Oral Medicine,10.1101/2021.03.29.21253174,2,Keiichi Tsukinoki,"Department of Environmental Pathology, Graduate School of Dentistry, Kanagawa Dental University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.29.21253174v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.29.21253174v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
3175,A mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission between frontliners and the general public,"The number of COVID-19 cases is continuously increasing in different countries (as of March 2020) including the Philippines. It is estimated that the basic reproductive number of COVID-19 is around 1.5 to 4. The basic reproductive number characterizes the average number of persons that a primary case can directly infect in a population full of susceptible individuals. However, there can be superspreaders that can infect more than this estimated basic reproductive number. In this study, we formulate a conceptual mathematical model on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 between the frontliners and the general public. We assume that the general public has a reproductive number between 1.5 to 4, and frontliners (e.g. healthcare workers, customer service and retail personnel, food service crews, and transport or delivery workers) have a higher reproduction number. Our simulations show that both the frontliners and the general public should be protected or resilient against the disease. Protecting only the frontliners will not result in flattening the epidemic curve. Protecting only the general public may flatten the epidemic curve but the infection risk faced by the frontliners is still high, which may eventually affect their work. Our simple model does not consider all factors involved in COVID-19 transmission in a community, but the insights from our model results remind us of the importance of community effort in controlling the transmission of the disease. All in all, the take-home message is that everyone in the community, whether a frontliner or not, should be protected or should implement preventive measures to avoid being infected.","Buhat, C. A.

We aimed to establish whether blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration was associated with COVID-19 mortality, and inpatient confirmed COVID-19 infection, in UK Biobank participants.

MethodsUK Biobank recruited 502,624 participants aged 37-73 years between 2006 and 2010. Baseline exposure data, including 25(OH)D concentration, were linked to COVID-19 mortality. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed for the association between 25(OH)D and COVID-19 death, and poisson regression analyses for the association between 25(OH)D and severe COVID-19 infection.

ResultsComplete data were available for 341,484 UK Biobank participants, of which 656 had inpatient confirmed COVID-19 infection and 203 died of COVID-19 infection. Vitamin D was associated with severe COVID-19 infection and mortality univariably (mortality HR=0.99; 95% CI 0.98-0.998; p=0.016), but not after adjustment for confounders (mortality HR=0.998; 95% CI=0.99-1.01; p=0.696).

ConclusionsOur findings do not support a potential link between vitamin D concentrations and risk of severe COVID-19 infection and mortality.

5895,Excess mortality during COVID-19 in five European countries and a critique of mortality analysis data,"INTRODUCTIONThe COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing event disrupting lives, health systems, and economies worldwide. Clear data about the pandemics impact is lacking, namely regarding mortality. This work aims to study the impact of COVID-19 through the analysis of all-cause mortality data made available by different European countries, and to critique their mortality surveillance data.

METHODSEuropean countries that had publicly available data about the number of deaths per day/week were selected (England and Wales, France, Italy, Netherlands and Portugal). Two different methods were selected to estimate the excess mortality due to COVID19: (DEV) deviation from the expected value from homologue periods, and (RSTS) remainder after seasonal time series decomposition. We estimate total, age- and gender-specific excess mortality. Furthermore, we compare different policy responses to COVID-19.

RESULTSExcess mortality was found in all 5 countries, ranging from 10.6% in Portugal (DEV) to 98.5% in Italy (DEV). Furthermore, excess mortality is higher than COVID-attributed deaths in all 5 countries.

DISCUSSIONThe impact of COVID-19 on mortality appears to be larger than officially attributed deaths, in varying degrees in different countries. Comparisons between countries would be useful, but large disparities in mortality surveillance data could not be overcome. Unreliable data, and even a lack of cause-specific mortality data undermine the understanding of the impact of policy choices on both direct and indirect deaths during COVID-19. European countries should invest more on mortality surveillance systems to improve the publicly available data.","Felix-Cardoso, J.; Vasconcelos, H.; Rodrigues, P.; Cruz-Correia, R.",2020-05-02,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.28.20083147,1,Jorge Felix-Cardoso,Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Porto,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20083147v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20083147v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
17827,Point-of-care detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab samples using an integrated smartphone-based centrifugal microfluidic platform,"With its origin estimated around December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the ongoing 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a major global health challenge, resulting in more than 45 million infections and 1.2 million deaths. The demand for scalable, rapid and sensitive viral diagnostics is thus particularly pressing at present to help contain the rapid spread of infection and prevent overwhelming the capacity of health systems. While high-income countries have managed to rapidly expand diagnostic capacities, such is not the case in resource-limited settings of low- to medium-income countries.

Aiming at developing cost-effective viral load detection systems for point-of-care COVID-19 diagnostics in resource-limited and resource-rich settings alike, we report the development of an integrated modular centrifugal microfluidic platform to perform loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of viral RNA directly from heat-inactivated nasopharyngeal swab samples. The discs were pre-packed with dried n-benzyl-n-methylethanolamine modified agarose beads used as a versatile post-nucleic acid amplification signal enhancement strategy, allowing fluorescence detection via a smartphone camera and simple optics. The platform provided sample-to-answer analysis within 1 hour from sample collection and a detection limit between 100 and 1000 RNA copies in 10 L reaction volume. Furthermore, direct detection of non-extracted SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab samples from patients with Ct values below 26 (n=25 plus 6 PCR negative samples) was achieved with [~]94% sensitivity and 100% specificity, thus being fit-for-purpose to diagnose patients with a high risk of viral transmission. These results show significant promise towards bringing routine point-of-care COVID-19 diagnostics closer to resource-limited settings.","Soares, R. R. G.; Akhtar, A. S.; Pinto, I.

22117,Development and Validation of a Simplified Risk Score for the Prediction of Critical COVID-19 Illness in Newly Diagnosed Patients,"Scores for identifying patients at high risk of progression of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are discussed as key instruments for clinical decision-making and patient management during the current pandemic.

Here we used the patient data from the multicenter Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2 - Infected Patients (LEOSS) and applied a technique of variable selection in order to develop a simplified score to identify patients at increased risk of critical illness or death.

A total of 1,946 patients, who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were included in the initial analysis. They were split into a derivation and a validation cohort (n=1,297 and 649, respectively). A stability selection among a total of 105 baseline predictors for the combined endpoint of progression to critical phase or COVID-19-related death allowed us to develop a simplified score consisting of five predictors: CRP, Age, clinical disease phase (uncomplicated vs. complicated), serum urea and D-dimer (abbreviated as CAPS-D score). This score showed an AUC of 0.81 (CI95%: 0.77-0.85) in the validation cohort for predicting the combined endpoint within 7 days of diagnosis and 0.81 (CI95%: 0.77-0.85) during the full follow-up. Finally, we used an additional prospective cohort of 682 patients, who were diagnosed largely after the """"first wave"""" of the pandemic to validate predictive accuracy of the score, observing similar results (AUC for an event within 7 days: 0.83, CI95%, 0.78-0.87; for full follow-up: 0.82, CI95%, 0.78-0.86).

We thus successfully establish and validate an easily applicable score to calculate the risk of disease progression of COVID-19 to critical illness or death.","Werfel, S.; Jakob, C. E.

5076,Modest effects of contact reduction measures on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 in the most affected European countries and the US,"Population density, behaviour and cultural habits strongly influence the spread of pathogens. Consequently, key epidemiological parameters may vary from country to country. Many estimates of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 strongly depend on testing frequency and case definitions. The fatal cases due to SARS-CoV2 could be a more reliable parameter, since missing of deaths is less likely. We analysed the dynamics of new infection and death cases to estimate the daily reproduction numbers (Rt) and the effectiveness of control measures in the most affected European Countries and the US. In summary, calculating Rt based on the daily number of deaths as well as of new infections may lead to more reliable estimates than those based on infection cases alone, as death based Rt are expected to be less susceptible to testing bias or limited capacities.","Ensser, A.; Überla, P.; Überla, K.",2020-04-24,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.20.20067538,1,Armin Ensser,"Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander Universitaet Erlangen-Nuernberg (FAU)",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.20067538v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.20067538v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
7509,Time series forecasting of COVID-19 confirmed cases with ARIMA model in the South East Asian countries of India and Thailand: a comparative case study,"BackgroundAs economic burden makes it increasingly difficult for countries to continue imposing control measures, it is vital for countries to make predictions using time series forecasting before making decisions on lifting the restrictions.

AimSince apparent differences were noted in the disease transmission between the two South East Asian countries of India and Thailand, the study aims to draw comparative account of the progression of COVID 19 in near future between these two countries.

MethodsThe study used data of COVID 19 confirmed cases in India and Thailand from WHO COVID 19 situation reports during the time period between 25th March, 2020 and 14th May, 2020. After determination of stationarity in the data and differencing, observation of autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF), Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) (2,2,1) model was used to forecast the COVID 19 confirmed cases in both these countries for two weeks (i.e. 28th May, 2020). IBM SPSS version 20.0 software was used for data analysis.

ResultsThe study demonstrated a possible increasing trend in number of COVID 19 cases in India in the coming two weeks with an estimated point forecast of 1,28,772 (95% CI 115023-142520) by 28th May, 2020. A stationary phase was forecasted for Thailand with a difference of only 43 cases between 14th May (the last case of input data) and 28th May.

ConclusionThe time series forecasting employed in the present study warrants thorough preparation on part of the Indian health care system and authorities and calls for caution with regard to decisions made on lifting the control measures. The difference in the time series forecasting between these two South East Asian countries also highlights the need for strengthening of public health systems.","Chandu, V.

11998,"SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario, Canada, January 1-July 6, 2020","ObjectiveTo investigate COVID-19 epidemiology in Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario, Canada.

MethodsWe calculated the incidence rate ratio (January 1--July 6, 2020) between the 3 provinces, and estimated time-varying reproduction number, Rt, starting from March 1, using EpiEstim package in R.

ResultsUsing British Columbia as a reference, the incidence rate ratios in Alberta and Ontario are 3.1 and 4.3 among females, and 3.4 and 4.0 among males. In Ontario, Rt fluctuated ~1 in March, reached values >1 in early and mid-April, then dropped <1 in late April and early May. Rt rose to ~1 in mid-May and then remained <1 from late May through early July. In British Columbia, Rt dropped <1 in early April, but it increased towards the end of April. Rt <1 in May while it fluctuated around 1.0 in June and early July. In Alberta, Rt > 1 in March; Rt dropped in early April and rose again in late April. In much of May, Rt <1, but Rt increases in early June and fluctuates ~1 since mid-June.

ConclusionsRt wavering around 1.0 indicated that three provinces of Canada have managed to achieve limited onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as of early July 2020.","Fung, I. C.-H.; Hung, Y.

19645,Simulation-Based Study on the COVID-19 Airborne Transmission in a Restaurant,"COVID-19 has shown a high potential of transmission via virus-carrying aerosols as supported by growing evidence. However, detailed investigations that draw direct links between aerosol transport and virus infection are still lacking. To fill in the gap, we conducted a systematic computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based investigation of indoor air flow and the associated aerosol transport in a restaurant setting, where likely cases of airborne infection of COVID-19 caused by asymptomatic individuals were widely reported by the media. We employed an advanced in-house large eddy simulation (LES) solver and other cutting-edge numerical methods to resolve complex indoor processes simultaneously, including turbulence, flow-aerosol interplay, thermal effect, and the filtration effect by air conditioners. Using the aerosol exposure index derived from the simulation, we are able to provide a spatial map of the airborne infection risk under different settings. Our results have shown a remarkable direct linkage between regions of high aerosol exposure index and the reported infection patterns in the restaurant, providing strong support to the airborne transmission occurring in this widely-reported incidence. Using flow structure analysis and reverse-time tracing of aerosol trajectories, we are able to further pinpoint the influence of environmental parameters on the infection risks and highlight the needs for more effective preventive measures, e.g., placement of shielding according to the local flow patterns. Our research, thus, has demonstrated the capability and value of high-fidelity CFD tools for airborne infection risk assessment and the development of effective preventive measures.","Liu, H.; He, S.; Shen, L.; Hong, J.",2020-12-14,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.12.10.20247403,1,Jiarong Hong,University of Minnesota,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.20247403v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.20247403v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
24208,Using proper mean generation intervals in modelling of COVID-19,"In susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) epidemic models, with the exponentially distributed duration of exposed/infectious statuses, the mean generation interval (GI, time lag between infections of a primary case and its secondary case) equals the mean latent period (LP) plus the mean infectious period (IP). It was widely reported that the GI for COVID-19 is as short as 5 days. However, many works in top journals used longer LP or IP with the sum (i.e., GI), e.g., > 7 days. This discrepancy will lead to overestimated basic reproductive number, and exaggerated expectation of infectious attack rate and control efficacy, since all these quantities are functions of basic reproductive number. We argue that it is important to use suitable epidemiological parameter values.","Tang, X.; Musa, S.

15281,The case series of 34 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed with HIV infection from Central and Eastern European Countries - Euroguidelines in Central and Eastern Europe Network Group data,"BackgroundA novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was detected at the end of 2019 in China. There are many COVID-19 studies in progress however, little is known about the course of COVID-19 in people living with HIV (PLWH). The aim of our study was to describe epidemiology and clinical characteristics of PLWH diagnosed with COVID-19 reported form Central and Eastern European Countries.

MethodsOn-line survey was sent to Euroguidelines in Central and Eastern Europe (ECEE) Network Group. Analysis included all confirmed COVID-19 cases between March 11 and June 26 2020 among PLWH in 12 countries: Albania, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, and Serbia.

ResultsIn total 34 cases were reported. The mean age of those patients was 42.7 years (IQR = 35.8-48.5) and most of the patients were male (70.6% vs 29.4%). The mean CD4+ T-cell count prior COVID-19 diagnosis was 558 cells/mm3 (IQR = 312-719) and HIV RNA viral load (VL) was undetectable in 18 of 34 (53%) cases, the data about most recent HIV RNA VL was not available in three cases (8,8%). Comorbidities were observed in 19 (55.9%) patients, mostly cardiovascular disease (27,8%), and in 10 (29.4%) patients had coinfection, mostly chronic hepatitis C (87.5%). The clinical course of COVID-19 was asymptomatic in 4 (12%) cases, mild disease without hospitalization was reported in 11 (32%) cases. Stable patients with respiratory and/or systemic symptoms have been documented in 14 (41%) cases; 5 (15%) patients were clinically unstable with respiratory failure. Full recovery was reported in 31 (91%) cases, two patients died. In one case the data was not available.

14981,Increased extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) reflects rapid inflammatory oedema and mortality in COVID-19 associated ARDS,"OBJECTIVENearly 5 % of the patients with COVID-19 develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) is a marker of pulmonary oedema which is associated with mortality in ARDS. In this study we evaluate whether EVLWI is higher in patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS as compared to controls and whether EVLWI has the potential to monitor disease progression.

METHODSFrom the day of intubation, EVLWI, cardiac function were monitored by transpulmonary thermodilution in n=25 patients with COVID-19 and compared to a control group of 49 non-COVID-19 ARDS-patients.

RESULTSEVLWI in COVID-19-patients was noticeably elevated and significantly higher than in the control group (17 (11-38) vs. 11 (6-26) mL/kg; p<0.001). High pulmonary vascular permeability index values (2.9 (1.0-5.2) versus 1.9 (1.0-5.2); p=0.003) suggest inflammatory oedema. By contrast, the cardiac parameters SVI, GEF and GEDVI were comparable. High EVLWI values were associated with viral persistence, prolonged intensive care treatment and mortality (23.2{+/-}6.7% vs. 30.3{+/-}6.0%, p=0.025).

CONCLUSIONSCompared to the control group, COVID-19 results in markedly elevated EVLWI-values in patients with ARDS. EVLWI reflects a non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in COVID-19 associated ARDS and could serve as parameter to monitor ARDS progression.","Rasch, S.; Schmidle, P.; Sancak, S.; Herner, A.; Huberle, C.; Schulz, D.; Mayr, U.; Schneider, J.; Spinner, C.; Geisler, F.; Schmid, R.

5539,FIRST DETECTION OF SARS-COV-2 IN UNTREATED WASTEWATERS IN ITALY,"Several studies have demonstrated the advantages of environmental surveillance through the monitoring of sewer systems for the assessment of viruses circulating in a given community (wastewater-based epidemiology, WBE).

During the COVID-19 public health emergency, many reports have described the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stools from COVID-19 patients, and a few studies reported the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters worldwide. Italy is among the worlds worst-affected countries in the COVID-19 pandemic, but so far there are no studies assessing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in Italian wastewaters. To this aim, twelve influent sewage samples, collected between February and April 2020 from Wastewater Treatment Plants in Milan and Rome, were tested adapting, for concentration, the standard WHO procedure for Poliovirus surveillance. Molecular analysis was undertaken with three nested protocols, including a newly designed SARS-CoV-2 specific primer set.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection occurred in volumes of 250 mL of wastewaters collected in both areas at high (Milan) and low (Rome) epidemic circulation, according to clinical data. Overall, 6 out of 12 samples were positive. One of the positive results was obtained in a Milan wastewater sample collected a few days after the first notified Italian case of autochthonous SARS-CoV-2.

The study shows that WBE has the potential to be applied to SARS-CoV-2 as a sensitive tool to study spatial and temporal trends of virus circulation in the population.","La Rosa, G.; Iaconelli, M.; Mancini, P.; Bonanno Ferraro, G.; Veneri, C.; Bonadonna, L.; Lucentini, L.; Suffredini, E.",2020-05-07,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.25.20079830,2,Giuseppina La Rosa,National Institute of Health,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079830v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079830v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139652
2510,Protocol for a randomized controlled trial testing inhaled nitric oxide therapy in spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19,"Introductionthe current worldwide outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is seriously threatening the public health. The number of infected patients is continuously increasing and the need for Intensive Care Unit admission ranges from 5 to 26%. The mortality is reported to be around 3.4% with higher values for the elderly and in patients with comorbidities. Moreover, this condition is challenging the healthcare system where the outbreak reached its highest value. To date there is still no available treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO) has a beneficial effect on the coronavirus-mediated acute respiratory syndrome, and this can be related to its viricidal effect. The time from the symptoms onset to the development of severe respiratory distress is relatively long. We hypothesize that high concentrations of inhaled NO administered during early phases of COVID-19 infection can prevent the progression of the disease.

Methods and analysisThis is a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Spontaneous breathing patients admitted to the hospital for symptomatic COVID-19 infection will be eligible to enter the study. Patients in the treatment group will receive inhaled NO at high doses (140-180 parts per million) for 30 minutes, 2 sessions every day for 14 days in addition to the hospital care. Patient in the control group will receive only hospital care. The primary outcome is the percentage of patients requiring endotracheal intubation due to the progression of the disease in the first 28 days from enrollment in the study. Secondary outcomes include mortality at 28 days, proportion of negative test for SARS-CoV-2 at 7 days and time to clinical recovery.

Ethics and disseminationThe trial protocol has been approved at the Investigation Review Boards of Xijing Hospital (Xian, China) and The Partners Human Research Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, USA) is pending. Recruitment is expected to start in March 2020. Results of this study will be published in scientific journals, presented at scientific meetings, and on related website or media in fighting this widespread contagious disease.

25606,Deprivation and Exposure to Public Activities during the COVID-19 Pandemic in England and Wales,"BackgroundDifferential exposure to public activities and non-household contacts may contribute to stark deprivation-related inequalities in SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes, but has not been directly investigated. We set out to investigate whether participants in Virus Watch - a large community cohort study based in England and Wales - reported different levels of exposure to public activities and non-household contacts during the Autumn-Winter phase of the COVID-19 pandemic according to postcode-level socioeconomic deprivation.

MethodsParticipants (n=20120-25228 across surveys) reported their daily activities during three weekly periods in late November 2020, late December 2020, and mid-February 2021. Deprivation was quantified based on participants postcode of residence using English or Welsh Indices of Multiple Deprivation quintiles. We used Poisson mixed effect models with robust standard errors to estimate the relationship between deprivation and risk of exposure to public activities during each survey period.

ResultsRelative to participants in the least deprived areas, participants in the most deprived areas persistently exhibited elevated risk of exposure to vehicle sharing (aRR range across time points 1.73-8.52), public transport (aRR 3.13-5.73), work or education outside of the household (aRR 1.09-1.21), essential shops (aRR 1.09-1.13) and non-household contacts (aRR 1.15-1.19) across multiple survey periods.

ConclusionDifferential exposure to essential public activities in deprived communities is likely to contribute to inequalities in infection risk and outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health interventions to reduce exposure during essential activities and financial and practical support to enable low-paid workers to stay at home during periods of intense transmission may reduce COVID-related inequalities.","Beale, S.; Braithwaite, I.; Navaratnam, A.

1896,Effective containment explains sub-exponential growth in confirmed cases of recent COVID-19 outbreak in Mainland China,"The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China is characterized by a distinctive algebraic, sub-exponential increase of confirmed cases with time during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate. Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents  = 2.1 {+/-} 0.3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population. These insights may aid the implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced COVID-19 secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.","Maier, B.

10004,Assessing the impact of coordinated COVID-19 exit strategies across Europe,"As rates of new COVID-19 cases decline across Europe due to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing policies and lockdown measures, countries require guidance on how to ease restrictions while minimizing the risk of resurgent outbreaks. Here, we use mobility and case data to quantify how coordinated exit strategies could delay continental resurgence and limit community transmission of COVID-19. We find that a resurgent continental epidemic could occur as many as 5 weeks earlier when well-connected countries with stringent existing interventions end their interventions prematurely. Further, we found that appropriate coordination can greatly improve the likelihood of eliminating community transmission throughout Europe. In particular, synchronizing intermittent lockdowns across Europe meant half as many lockdown periods were required to end community transmission continent-wide.

One Sentence SummaryEU coordination in easing restrictions is key to preventing resurgent COVID-19 outbreaks and stopping community transmission.","Ruktanonchai, N.

23722,Associations of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness with patient age and comorbidities,"Vaccinations are considered the major tool to curb the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A randomized placebo-controlled trial of the BNT162b2 vaccine has demonstrated a 95% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 disease. These results are now corroborated with statistical analyses of real-world vaccination rollouts, but resolving vaccine effectiveness across demographic groups is challenging. Here, applying a multivariable logistic regression analysis approach to a large patient-level dataset, including SARS-CoV-2 tests, vaccine inoculations and personalized demographics, we model vaccine effectiveness at daily resolution and its interaction with sex, age and comorbidities. Vaccine effectiveness gradually increased post day 12 of inoculation, then plateaued, around 35 days, reaching 91.2% [CI 88.8%-93.1%] for all infections and 99.3% [CI 95.3%-99.9%] for symptomatic infections. Effectiveness was uniform for men and women yet declined mildly but significantly with age and for patients with specific chronic comorbidities, most notably type 2 diabetes. Quantifying real-world vaccine effectiveness, including both biological and behavioral effects, our analysis provides initial measurement of vaccine effectiveness across demographic groups.","Yelin, I.; Katz, R.; Herzel, E.; Berman-Zilberstein, T.; Ben-Tov, A.; Kuint, J.; Gazit, S.; Patalon, T.; Chodick, G.; Kishony, R.",2021-03-17,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.03.16.21253686,1,Roy Kishony,Technion - Israel Institute of Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.16.21253686v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.16.21253686v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
24972,Behavioral nudges increase COVID-19 vaccinations: Two randomized controlled trials,"Fighting the COVID-19 pandemic requires quick and effective strategies to maximize vaccine uptake. We present two sequential randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that tackle this challenge with behavioral science insights. We deliver text-based nudges to UCLA Health patients one day (first RCT; N=113,229) and eight days (second RCT; N=90,662) after they receive notifications of vaccine eligibility. In the first RCT, text messages designed to make vaccination salient and easy to schedule boost appointment and vaccination rates by 86% and 26%, respectively. Nudges that make patients feel endowed with the vaccine heighten these effects, but addressing vaccine hesitancy via a video-based information intervention does not yield benefits beyond simple text. These results hold across ethnicity and age groups. By contrast, online experiments (N=2,003) soliciting hypothetical responses to the same messages reveal the opposite patterns, underscoring the importance of pilot-testing behavioral nudges in the real world before scaling them up. In the second RCT, we further find that receiving a second reminder boosts appointment and vaccination rates by 52% and 16%, respectively. Our findings suggest that text-based nudges can substantially increase and accelerate COVID-19 vaccinations at almost zero marginal cost, highlighting the promising role of behavioral science in addressing a critical component of the COVID-19 pandemic response.","Dai, H.; Saccardo, S.; Han, M.

20185,"A Systematic Review of the Incubation Period of SARS-CoV-2: The Effects of Age, Biological Sex, and Location on Incubation Period","A systematic review of the incubation period of COVID-19 was compiled and analyzed from 21 quantitative studies. We investigated the incubation period of COVID-19 with regard to age, biological sex, location, and severity of the disease. Based on the data extracted, we report an overall mean and median incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 of 5.894 days and 5.598 days, respectively. The incubation period did not statistically vary for biological sex or age, but some studies suggest a longer incubation period in the young and elderly. Cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei Province of China may have a shorter incubation period for COVID-19 but the shorter incubation period may be due to an increase in viral load. In studying coronavirus strains such as SARS and MERS, researchers have discovered an inverse relationship between incubation period length and virus severity. Taking into consideration that SARS-CoV-2 is part of the beta-coronavirus family, as well as the study mentioned above, we suggest that people who experience more severe disease due to SARS-CoV-2 may have a shorter incubation period.","Daley, C.; Fydenkevez, M.; Ackerman-Morris, S.",2020-12-24,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.12.23.20248790,1,Shari Ackerman-Morris,Wheaton College,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.23.20248790v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.23.20248790v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
23216,Social-distancing Fatigue: Evidence from Real-time Crowd-sourced Traffic Data,"IntroductionTo mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent overwhelming the healthcare system, social-distancing policies such as school closure, stay-at-home orders, and indoor dining closure have been utilized worldwide. These policies function by reducing the rate of close contact within populations and results in decreased human mobility. Adherence to social distancing can substantially reduce disease spread. Thus, quantifying human mobility and social-distancing compliance, especially at high temporal resolution, can provide great insight into the impact of social distancing policies.

MethodsWe used the movement of individuals around New York City (NYC), measured via traffic levels, as a proxy for human mobility and the impact of social-distancing policies (i.e., work from home policies, school closure, indoor dining closure etc.). By data mining Google traffic in real-time, and applying image processing, we derived high resolution time series of traffic in NYC. We used time series decomposition and generalized additive models to quantify changes in rush hour/non-rush hour, and weekday/weekend traffic, pre-pandemic and following the roll-out of multiple social distancing interventions.

ResultsMobility decreased sharply on March 14, 2020 following declaration of the pandemic. However, levels began rebounding by approximately April 13, almost 2 months before stay-at-home orders were lifted, indicating premature increase in mobility, which we term social-distancing fatigue. We also observed large impacts on diurnal traffic congestion, such that the pre-pandemic bi-modal weekday congestion representing morning and evening rush hour was dramatically altered. By September, traffic congestion rebounded to approximately 75% of pre-pandemic levels.

ConclusionUsing crowd-sourced traffic congestion data, we described changes in mobility in Manhattan, NYC, during the COVID-19 pandemic. These data can be used to inform human mobility changes during the current pandemic, in planning for responses to future pandemics, and in understanding the potential impact of large-scale traffic interventions such as congestion pricing policies.

22077,Chronic COVID-19 Syndrome and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) following the first pandemic wave in Germany: a first analysis of a prospective observational study,"ObjectiveCharacterization of the clinical features of patients with persistent symptoms after mild to moderate COVID-19 infection and exploration of factors associated with the development of Chronic COVID-19 Syndrome (CCS).

MethodsSetting: Charite Fatigue Center with clinical immunologists and rheumatologist, neurologists and cardiologists at Charite University hospital.

Participants: 42 patients who presented with persistent moderate to severe fatigue six months following a mostly mild SARS-CoV-2 infection at the Charite Fatigue Center from July to November 2020.

Main outcome measures: The primary outcomes were clinical and paraclinical data and meeting diagnostic criteria for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Relevant neurological and cardiopulmonary morbidity was excluded.

ResultsThe median age was 36.5, range 22-62, 29 patients were female and 13 male. At six months post acute COVID-19 all patients had fatigue (Chalder Fatigue Score median 25 of 33, range 14-32), the most frequent other symptoms were post exertional malaise (n=41), cognitive symptoms (n=40), headache (n=38), and muscle pain (n=35). Most patients were moderately to severely impaired in daily live with a median Bell disability score of 50 (range 15-90) of 100 (healthy) and Short Form 36 (SF-36) physical function score of 63 (range 15-80) of 100. 19 of 42 patients fulfilled the 2003 Canadian Consensus Criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). These patients reported more fatigue in the Chalder Fatigue Score (p=0.006), more stress intolerance (p=0.042) and more frequent and longer post exertional malaise (PEM) (p=0.003), and hypersensitivity to noise (p=0.029), light (p=0.0143) and temperature (p=0.024) compared to patients not meeting ME/CFS criteria. Handgrip force was diminished in most patients compared to healthy control values, and lower in CCS/CFS compared to non-CFS CCS (Fmax1 p=0.085, Fmax2, p=0.050, Fmean1 p=0.043, Fmean2 p=0.034, mean of 10 repeat handgrips, 29 female patients). Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) deficiency was observed frequently (22% of all patients) and elevated IL-8 levels were found in 43% of patients.

ConclusionsChronic COVID-19 Syndrome at months 6 is a multisymptomatic frequently debilitating disease fulfilling diagnostic criteria of ME/CFS in about half of the patients in our study.

5195,Risk of COVID-19 and long-term exposure to air pollution: evidence from the first wave in China,"People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease or hypertension have a high risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Long-term exposure to air pollution, especially PM2.5, has also been associated with COVID-19 mortality. We collated individual-level data of confirmed COVID-19 cases during the first wave of the epidemic in mainland China. We fitted a generalized linear model using city-level COVID-19 cases and severe cases as the outcome, and long-term average levels of air pollutants as the exposure. Our analysis was adjusted using several variables, including a mobile phone dataset, covering human movement from Wuhan before the travel ban and movements within each city during the time of emergency response. Other variables included census, smoking prevalence, climate, and socio-economic data from 324 cities in China. We adjusted for human mobility and socio-economic factors, and found that an increase in long-term NO2 or PM2.5 may correspond to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases and severe infections. However, the linkage might also be affected by the confounding factor of population size because of the predefined correlation between population size and air pollution. The results are derived from a large, newly compiled and geocoded repository of population and epidemiological data relevant to COVID-19. The findings of this paper (and other previous studies that have given ambiguous results) indicate that a more definitive analysis is needed of the link between COVID-19 and air pollution.","Zheng, P.; Liu, Y.; Song, H.; Wu, C.-H.; Li, B.; Kraemer, M.

8144,The Outcome Impact of Early vs Late HFNC Oxygen Therapy in Elderly Patients with COVID-19 and ARDS,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide. High-flow nasal cannula therapy (HFNC) is a major oxygen supporting therapy for severely ill patients, but information regarding the timing of HFNC application is scarce, especially in elderly patients. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 110 elderly patients ([&ge;]65 years) who received HFNC from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Peoples Hospital of Xiantao City and Chinese Medicine Hospital of Shishou City in Hubei Province, China, and from Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Peoples Hospital of Yangjiang City, Peoples Hospital of Maoming City in Guangdong Province, China.

Of the 110 patients, the median age was 71 years (IQR, 68-78) and 59.1% was male. Thirty-eight patients received HFNC when 200 mmHg < PO2/FiO2 [&le;] 300 mmHg (early HFNC group), and 72 patients received HFNC treatment when 100 mmHg < PaO2/FiO2 [&le;] 200 mmHg (late HFNC group). Compared with the late HFNC group, patients in the early HFNC group had a lower likelihood of developing severe ARDS, longer time from illness onset to severe ARDS and shorter duration of viral shedding after illness onset, as well as shorter lengths of ICU and hospital stay. Twenty-four patients died during hospitalization, of whom 22 deaths (30.6%) were in the late HFNC group and 2(5.3%) in the early HFNC group. It is concluded that the Prognosis was better in severely ill elderly patients with COVID-19 receiving early compared to late HFNC. This suggests HFNC could be considered early in this disease process.","Deng, L.; Lei, S.; Jiang, F.; Lubarsky, D. A.; Zhang, L.; Liu, D.; Han, C.; Zhou, D.; Wang, Z.; Sun, X.; Zhang, Y.; Cheung, C.

17683,SARS-CoV-2 responsive T cell numbers are associated with protection from COVID-19: A prospective cohort study in keyworkers,"Immune correlates of protection from COVID-19 are incompletely understood. 2,826 keyworkers had T-SPOT(R) Discovery SARS-CoV-2 tests (measuring interferon-{gamma} secreting, SARS-CoV-2 responsive T cells, Oxford Immunotec Ltd), and anti-Spike S1 domain IgG antibody levels (EuroImmun AG) performed on recruitment into a cohort study. 285/2,826 (10.1%) of participants had positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests, predominantly associated with symptomatic illness, during 200 days followup. T cell responses to Spike, Nucleoprotein and Matrix proteins (SNM responses) were detected in some participants at recruitment, as were anti-Spike S1 IgG antibodies; higher levels of both were associated with protection from subsequent SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. In volunteers with moderate antibody responses, who represented 39% (252/654) of those with detectable anti-Spike IgG, protection was partial, and higher with higher circulating T cell SNM responses. SARS-CoV-2 responsive T cell numbers predict protection in individuals with low anti-Spike IgG responses; serology alone underestimates the proportion of the population protected after infection.","Wyllie, D.

7969,Predicting COVID-19 spread and public health needs to contain the pandemic in West-Africa,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is causing devastating demographic, social, and economic damage globally. Understanding current patterns of the pandemic spread and forecasting its long-term trajectory is essential in guiding policies aimed at curtailing the pandemic. This is particularly important in regions with weak economies and fragile health care systems such as West-Africa. We formulate and use a deterministic compartmental model to (i) assess the current patterns of COVID-19 spread in West-Africa, (ii) evaluate the impact of currently implemented control measures, and (iii) predict the future course of the pandemic with and without currently implemented and additional control measures in West-Africa. An analytical expression for the threshold level of control measures (involving a reduction in the effective contact rate) required to eliminate the pandemic is computed. Considering currently applied health control measures, numerical simulations of the model using baseline parameter values estimated from West-African COVID-19 data project a 60% reduction in the daily number of cases when the epidemic attains its peak. More reduction in the number of cases will be achieved if additional public health control measures that result in a reduction in the effective contact rate are implemented. We found out that disease elimination is difficult when more asymptomatic individuals contribute in transmission or are not identified and isolated in a timely manner. However, maintaining a baseline level of asymptomatic isolation and a low transmission rate will lead to a significant reduction in the number of daily cases when the pandemic peaks. For example, at the baseline level of asymptomatic isolation, at least a 53% reduction in the transmission rate is required for disease elimination, while disease elimination is also possible if asymptomatic individuals are identified and isolated within 2 days (after the incubation period). Combining two or more measures is better for disease control, e.g., if asymptomatic humans are contact traced or identified and isolated in less than 3 days then only about a 31% reduction in the disease transmission rate is required for disease elimination. Furthermore, we showed that the currently implemented measures caused the time-dependent effective reproduction number to reduce by approximately 37% from February 28, to August 24, 2020. We conclude that COVID-19 elimination requires more control measures than what is currently being applied in West-Africa and that mass testing and contact tracing in order to identify and isolate asymptomatic individuals early is very important in curtailing the burden of the pandemic.","Taboe, B.

6699,"The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Minas Gerais, Brazil: insights from epidemiological data and SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing.","The recent emergence of a previously unknown coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), first confirmed in the city of Wuhan in China in December 2019, has caused serious public health and economic issues due to its rapid dissemination worldwide. Although 61,888 confirmed cases had been reported in Brazil by 28 April 2020, little was known about the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the country. To better understand the recent epidemic in the second most populous state in southeast Brazil (Minas Gerais, MG), we looked at existing epidemiological data from 3 states and sequenced 40 complete genomes from MG cases using Nanopore. We found evidence of multiple independent introductions from outside MG, both from genome analyses and the overly dispersed distribution of reported cases and deaths. Epidemiological estimates of the reproductive number using different data sources and theoretical assumptions all suggest a reduction in transmission potential since the first reported case, but potential for sustained transmission in the near future. The estimated date of introduction in Brazil was consistent with epidemiological data from the first case of a returning-traveler from Lombardy, Italy. These findings highlight the unique reality of MGs epidemic and reinforce the need for real-time and continued genomic surveillance strategies as a way of understanding and therefore preparing against the epidemic spread of emerging viral pathogens.","Xavier, J.; Giovanetti, M.; Adelino, T.; Fonseca, V.; Vitor Barbosa Da Costa, A.; Aparecida Ribeiro, A.; Nascimento Felicio, K.; Guerra Duarte, C.; Vinicius Ferreira Silva, M.; Salgado, A.; Teixeira Lima, M.; De Jesus, R.; Fabri, A.; Franco Soares Zoboli, C.; Gutemberg Souza Santos, T.; Iani, F.; Maria Bispo De Filippis, A.; Agudo Mendonca Teixeira De Siqueira, M.; Luiz De Abreu, A.; De Azevedo, V.; Brock Ramalho, D.; F.

9561,On the increasing role of older adolescents and younger adults during the SARSCoV2 epidemic in Mexico,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Mexico is growing, and there is uncertainty regarding the role that different age groups play in propagating the epidemic.

MethodsWe used data on hospitalizations with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from the Mexican Ministry of Health in ten 5-year age groups: 10-14through 55-59 years. For each age group g, we computed the proportion E(g) of individuals in that age group among all hospitalized cases aged 10-59 years during the early period (between April 20 - May 3, 2020), the corresponding proportion L(g) during the later periods (May 11-24), as well as the relative risk RR(g)= L(g)/E(g). For each pair of age groups g1,g2, RR(g1)>RR(g2) is interpreted as a relative increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections in the age group g1 compared with g2 for the later vs. early period.

ResultsThe highest RR estimates belong to persons aged 15-19 years (RR=1.93(95% CI (1.19,3.12)) and 20-24 years (RR=1.40(1.07,1.83)). The RR estimates in persons aged over 30 years were significantly lower compared to persons aged 15-24 years.

ConclusionsOur results suggest a temporal increase in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in older adolescents and younger adults compared to other age groups. Targeted interventions, particularly public health messaging at those age groups to increase knowledge and risk awareness may be considered.","Stern, D.; Lajous, M.; De La Rosa, B.; Goldstein, E.",2020-12-15,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.10.20127795,2,Martin Lajous,Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.10.20127795v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.10.20127795v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
13706,The ImmuneRACE Study: A Prospective Multicohort Study of Immune Response Action to COVID-19 Events with the ImmuneCODE™ Open Access Database,"ObjectivesThe primary aim of this study is to increase our understanding of the adaptive immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus by assaying the peripheral immune repertoire for virus-associated T-cell receptors (TCRs). Secondary aims include identification and characterization of SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell receptors (BCRs) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) generated by antibody-producing cells during and after acute infection.

Trial designImmuneRACE is a prospective, single group, multi-cohort, exploratory study of unselected eligible participants exposed to, infected with, or recovering from SARS-CoV-2.

ParticipantsApproximately 1000 individuals, aged 18 to 89 years and residing in 24 different geographic areas within the United States, will be enrolled, primarily using remote telemedicine technologies. Cohorts will be based on clinical history. Cohort 1 will include participants exposed to SARS-CoV-2 within 2 weeks of study entry. Cohort 2 participants will include those clinically diagnosed or with positive laboratory confirmation of active COVID-19 disease. Cohort 3 will comprise participants previously diagnosed with COVID-19 disease who have been deemed recovered based on two consecutive negative tests, clearance by a healthcare professional, or resolution of symptoms related to COVID-19. All participants must be able to communicate with the investigator and understand and comply with the requirements of the study. Protected populations and those who may not safely participate are not eligible for this study.

Intervention and comparatorBlood samples and nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs will be collected from participants. Nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs will be collected by inserting a swab into the nose or throat of the participant. Samples will be shipped frozen or transported refrigerated or at room temperature to Adaptive Biotechnologies for processing, including, but not limited to, testing for coronavirus or other respiratory illnesses, DNA extraction, and TCR analysis. The immunoSEQ assay will be conducted using DNA extracted from blood samples. An electronic questionnaire will be administered to collect information pertaining to the participants medical history, symptoms, and diagnostic tests performed for COVID-19 disease. Participants will have the option to undergo additional blood draws and questionnaires over a 2-month period. In collaboration with Microsoft, we will use machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches to construct a classifier based on TCR repertoire data designed to accurately distinguish COVID-19-positive cases from unexposed controls (from the ImmuneCODE database of TCR sequences). A rigorous statistical analysis will be performed to validate the classifier.

Main outcomesThe main outcomes of this study will include a comparison of disease-specific TCR signatures in patients and controls, identification of the immunodominant antigens that elicit a T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2, risk stratification based on an individuals immune signature, and determination of immune signatures of patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2 that may allow earlier detection of infection compared to available tests.

25734,Elevated blood glucose levels as a primary risk factor for the severity of COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2 started spreading towards the end of 2019 causing COVID-19, a disease that reached pandemic proportions among the human population within months. The reasons for the spectrum of differences in the severity of the disease across the population, and in particular why the disease affects more severely the aging population and those with specific preconditions are unclear. We developed machine learning models to mine 240,000 scientific papers openly accessible in the CORD-19 database, and constructed knowledge graphs to synthesize the extracted information and navigate the collective knowledge in an attempt to search for a potential common underlying reason for disease severity. The literature repeatedly pointed to elevated blood glucose as a key facilitator in the progression of COVID-19. Indeed, when we retraced the steps of the SARS-CoV-2 infection we found evidence linking elevated glucose to each step of the life-cycle of the virus, progression of the disease, and presentation of symptoms. Specifically, elevations of glucose provide ideal conditions for the virus to evade and weaken the first level of the immune defense system in the lungs, gain access to deep alveolar cells, bind to the ACE2 receptor and enter the pulmonary cells, accelerate replication of the virus within cells increasing cell death and inducing an pulmonary inflammatory response, which overwhelms an already weakened innate immune system to trigger an avalanche of systemic infections, inflammation and cell damage, a cytokine storm and thrombotic events. We tested the feasibility of the hypothesis by analyzing data across papers, reconstructing atomistically the virus at the surface of the pulmonary airways, and performing quantitative computational modeling of the effects of glucose levels on the infection process. We conclude that elevation in glucose levels can facilitate the progression of the disease through multiple mechanisms and can explain much of the variance in disease severity seen across the population. The study proposes diagnostic recommendations, new areas of research and potential treatments, and cautions on treatment strategies and critical care conditions that induce elevations in blood glucose levels.

HighlightsO_LIPatients with severe COVID-19 commonly present with elevated blood glucose levels.
C_LIO_LIElevated blood glucose impacts numerous biochemical pathways that can facilitate many steps of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
C_LIO_LIElevated blood glucose increases glucose in the pulmonary airway surface liquid (ASL), which breaks down the primary innate antiviral defenses of the lungs and facilitates viral infection and replication.
C_LIO_LIElevated blood glucose causes dysregulations of the immune response that facilitates the cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
C_LIO_LIElevated glucose levels act synergistically with SARS-CoV-2-dependent inactivation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to escalate the disease to multi-organ failure and thrombotic events.

8585,"Changes in Reproductive Rate of SARS-CoV-2 Due to Non-pharmaceutical Interventions in 1,417 U.S. Counties","In response to the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the U.S. has largely delegated implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to local governments on the state and county level. This staggered implementation combined with the heterogeneity of the U.S. complicates quantification the effect of NPIs on the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2.

We describe a data-driven approach to quantify the effect of NPIs that relies on county-level similarities to specialize a Bayesian mechanistic model based on observed fatalities. Using this approach, we estimate change in reproductive rate, Rt, due to implementation of NPIs in 1,417 U.S. counties.

We estimate that as of May 28th, 2020 1,177 out of the considered 1,417 U.S. counties have reduced the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2 to below 1.0. The estimated effect of any individual NPI, however, is different across counties. Stay-at-home orders were estimated as the only effective NPI in metropolitan and urban counties, while advisory NPIs were estimated to be effective in more rural counties. The expected level of infection predicted by the model ranges from 0 to 28.7% and is far from herd immunity even in counties with advanced spread.

Our results suggest that local conditions are pertinent to containment and re-opening decisions.","Wu, J. Y.; Killeen, B.

11030,"Exposure assessment for airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing","BackgroundEvidence for indoor airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is accumulating. If SARS-CoV-2 also spreads via aerosols, this has implications for measures taken to limit transmission.

ObjectivesThe aim of this study is to assess exposure to airborne SARS-CoV-2 particles from breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing in an indoor environment.

MethodsAn exposure assessment model was developed to estimate numbers of SARS-CoV-2 particles in aerosol droplets, expelled during breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing by an infected person in an unventilated indoor environment, and subsequent inhalation by one or more persons. Scenarios encompass a range of virus concentrations, room sizes and exposure times.

ResultsThe calculated total volume of expelled aerosol droplets was highest for a sneeze, followed by a cough and speaking for 20 minutes, and lastly breathing for 20 minutes. A few to as much as tens of millions of virus particles were expelled. Exposure probability strongly depends on the viral concentration in mucus, as well as on the scenario. Exposure probabilities were generally below 1% at a virus concentration in mucus below 105 per mL for all scenarios, increasing steeply at different higher concentrations. According to nose / throat swab data collected from patients, 75%, 50% and 5% of infected individuals carry an estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 per mL mucus of at least 105, 106 and 108, respectively.

DiscussionExposure to SARS-CoV-2 via aerosols generated during breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing in an unventilated indoor environment is possible. This study forms a basis to estimate probabilities of exposure to SARS-Cov-2 by airborne transmission in indoor spaces. As long as it is uncertain what fraction of the airborne virus particles is infectious and as long as a dose response relation is lacking, it is recommended to be precautious.","Schijven, J.

19576,The COVID University Challenge: a Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points Assessment of the Return of Students to Higher Education Establishments,"The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted economies and societies throughout the world in 2020. Education was especially affected, with schools and universities widely closed for long periods. People under 25 years have the lowest risk of severe disease but their activities can be key to persistent ongoing community transmission. A challenge arose for how to provide education, including university level, without the activities of students increasing wider community SARS- CoV-2 infections.

We used a Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP) framework to assess the risks associated with university student activity and recommend how to mitigate these risks. This tool appealed because it relies on multi-agency collaboration and interdisciplinary expertise and yet is low cost, allowing rapid generation of evidence-based recommendations.

We identified key critical control points associated with university student activities, lifestyle and interaction patterns both on-and-off campus. Unacceptable contact thresholds and the most up-to-date guidance were used to identify levels of risk for potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as well as recommendations based on existing research and emerging evidence for strategies that can reduce the risks of transmission. Employing the preventative measures we suggest can reduce the risks of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among and from university students. Reduction of infectious disease transmission in this demographic will reduce overall community transmission, lower demands on health services and reduce risk of harm to clinically vulnerable individuals while allowing vital education activity to continue. HACCP assessment proved a flexible tool for risk analysis in a specific setting in response to an emerging infectious disease threat.","Edmunds, K. L.; Bowater, L.; Brainard, J.

3941,The role of procalcitonin in early differential diagnosis of suspected children with COVID-19,"BackgroundWe aimed to identify clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children and evaluate the role of procalcitonin in early differential diagnosis.

MethodsA retrospective analysis was performed on all suspected pediatric cases.

Results39 (50.6%) of 77 suspected cases were comfirmed, 4 (5.2%) of them had viral coinfection. Compared with non-COVID-19 group (n=33), COVID-19 confirmed group (n=39) had fewer fever(OR[95% CI]0.467[0.314-0.694]; P=.000) and symptoms of acute respiratory infection (0.533[0.36-0.788]; P=.001), more asymptomatic (13.568[1.895-96.729]; P=.000), and more family cluster infections (5.077[2.224-11.591]; P=.000), while computed tomography had more positive findings of viral pneumonia (1.822[1.143-2.906]; P=.008). Age (6.9[3.6-10.5] vs 5[2.1-7.6]; P=. 088) and gender were statistically insignificant. Procalcitonin (0.05[0.029-0.076] vs 0.103[0.053-0.21]; P= 000) of COVID-19 alone group (n=35) was significantly reduced. While compared with coinfection group (n=4), procalcitonin (0.05[0.029-0.076] vs 0.144[0.109-2.26]; P=.010) was also reduced. The area under curve of model is 0.834 ([95% CI][0.741-0.926]; P=.000). Procalcitonin as a differential indicator of COVID-19 alone, its area under curve is 0.809 ([0.710-0.909]; P=.000).

18314,The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on hospital admissions for alcohol-related liver disease and pancreatitis: a time-series analysis,"BackgroundDuring the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there have been health concerns related to alcohol use and misuse. Therefore, the World Health Organization cautioned that alcohol consumption during the pandemic might have a negative impact. The aim of this study was to examine the population-level change in cases of alcohol-related liver disease and pancreatitis that required admission during the COVID-19 outbreak.

MethodsWe included patients aged 18 years or older who were hospitalized between July 2018 and June 2020 using Diagnostic Procedure Combination data, an administrative database in Japan, and counted the admission cases whose primary diagnosis was alcohol-related liver disease or pancreatitis. We defined the period from April 2020, when the Japanese government declared a state of emergency, as the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. The rate ratio (RR) of admissions with alcohol-related liver disease or pancreatitis per 1,000 admissions was tested using interrupted time series analysis. In addition, excess admissions for alcohol-related liver disease or pancreatitis were calculated.

ResultsOverall admissions were 3,026,389 cases, and a total of 10,242 admissions for alcohol-related liver disease or pancreatitis occurred from 257 hospitals. The rate of admissions per 1,000 admissions during the COVID-19 outbreak period (April 2020 to June 2020) had a 1.2 times increase compared with the pre-outbreak period (July 2018 to March 2020) for cases of alcohol-related liver disease or pancreatitis (RR: 1.22, 95%Confidence interval [CI]: 1.12 to 1.33). The COVID-19 pandemic caused about 214.75 (95%CI: 178.78 to 249.72) excess admissions for alcohol-related liver disease or pancreatitis based on predictions from our model.

11129,The usefulness of SARS-CoV-2 test positive proportion as a surveillance tool,"Comparison of COVID-19 case numbers over time and between locations is complicated by limits to virologic testing confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to under-reporting of incidence, and by variations in testing capacity between locations and over time. The proportion of tested individuals who have tested positive (test positive proportion, TPP) can potentially be used to qualitatively assess the testing capacity of a location; a high TPP could provide evidence that too few people are tested, leading to more under-reporting.

In this study we propose a simple model for testing in a population experiencing an epidemic of COVID-19, and derive an expression for TPP in terms of well-defined parameters in the model, related to testing and presence of other pathogens causing COVID-19 like symptoms. We use simulations to show situations in which the TPP is higher or lower than we expect based on these parameters, and the effect of testing strategies on the TPP. In our simulations, we find in the absence of dramatic shifts of testing practices in time or between spatial locations, the TPP is positively correlated with the incidence of infection. As a corollary, the TPP can be used to distinguish between a decline in confirmed cases due to decline in incidence (in which case TPP should decline) and a decline in confirmed cases due to testing constraints (in which case TPP should remain constant). We show that the proportion of tested individuals who present COVID-19 like symptoms (test symptomatic proportion, TSP) encodes similar information to the TPP but has different relationships with the testing parameters, and can thus provide additional information regarding dynamic changes in TPP and incidence.

Finally, we compare data on confirmed cases and TPP from US states. We conjecture why states may have higher or lower TPP than average. We suggest that collection of symptom status and age/risk category of tested individuals can aid interpretation of changes in TPP and increase the utility of TPP in assessing the state of the pandemic in different locations and times.

SummaryO_LIKey question: when can we use the proportion of tests that are positive (test positive proportion, TPP) as an indicator of the burden of infection in a state?
C_LIO_LIIf testing strategies are broadly similar between locations and over time, the TPP is positively correlated with incidence rates.
C_LIO_LIHowever, changes in testing practices over time and between locations can affect the TPP independently of the number of cases.
C_LIO_LIMore testing of asymptomatic individuals, e.g. through population-level testing, lowers the TPP.
C_LIO_LIWe can identify locations that have a lower or higher TPP than expected, given how many cases they are reporting.
C_LIO_LIEfficient transmission increases detected cases exponentially, resulting in large changes in confirmed cases compared to factors that change linearly.
C_LIO_LIData that could aid interpretability of the TPP include: age of individuals who test positive and negative, and other data on testing performed in high-prevalence settings; and symptom status of tested individuals.

3215,A meta-analysis on the role of children in SARS-CoV-2 in household transmission clusters,"The role of children in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 remains highly controversial. To address this issue, we performed a meta-analysis of the published literature on household SARS-CoV-2 transmission clusters (n=213 from 12 countries). Only 8 (3.8%) transmission clusters were identified as having a paediatric index case. Asymptomatic index cases were associated with a lower secondary attack in contacts than symptomatic index cases (estimate risk ratio [RR], 0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.29). To determine the susceptibility of children to household infections the secondary attack rate (SAR) in paediatric household contacts was assessed. The secondary attack rate in paediatric household contacts was lower than in adult household contacts (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42-0.91). These data have important implications for the ongoing management of the COVID-19 pandemic, including potential vaccine prioritization strategies.

11236,Reconstructing the early global dynamics of under-ascertained COVID-19 cases and infections,"BackgroundAsymptomatic or subclinical SARS-CoV-2 infections are often unreported, which means that confirmed case counts may not accurately reflect underlying epidemic dynamics. Understanding the level of ascertainment (the ratio of confirmed symptomatic cases to the true number of symptomatic individuals) and undetected epidemic progression is crucial to informing COVID-19 response planning, including the introduction and relaxation of control measures. Estimating case ascertainment over time allows for accurate estimates of specific outcomes such as seroprevalence, which is essential for planning control measures.

MethodsUsing reported data on COVID-19 cases and fatalities globally, we estimated the proportion of symptomatic cases (i.e. any person with any of fever >= 37.5{degrees}C, cough, shortness of breath, sudden onset of anosmia, ageusia or dysgeusia illness) that were reported in 210 countries and territories, given those countries had experienced more than ten deaths. We used published estimates of the case fatality ratio (CFR) as an assumed baseline. We then calculated the ratio of this baseline CFR to an estimated local delay-adjusted CFR to estimate the level of under-ascertainment in a particular location. We then fit a Bayesian Gaussian process model to estimate the temporal pattern of under-ascertainment.

ResultsWe estimate that, during March 2020, the median percentage of symptomatic cases detected across the 84 countries which experienced more than ten deaths ranged from 2.38% (Bangladesh) to 99.6% (Chile). Across the ten countries with the highest number of total confirmed cases as of 6th July 2020, we estimated that the peak number of symptomatic cases ranged from 1.4 times (Chile) to 17.8 times (France) larger than reported. Comparing our model with national and regional seroprevalence data where available, we find that our estimates are consistent with observed values. Finally, we estimated seroprevalence for each country. Despite low case detection in some countries, our results that adjust for this still suggest that all countries have had only a small fraction of their populations infected as of July 2020.

ConclusionsWe found substantial under-ascertainment of symptomatic cases, particularly at the peak of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in many countries. Reported case counts will therefore likely underestimate the rate of outbreak growth initially and underestimate the decline in the later stages of an epidemic. Although there was considerable under-reporting in many locations, our estimates were consistent with emerging serological data, suggesting that the proportion of each countrys population infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide is generally low.

3261,In-host Modelling of COVID-19 Kinetics in Humans,"COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the impact of emergent pathogens as a major threat for human health. The development of quantitative approaches to advance comprehension of the current outbreak is urgently needed to tackle this severe disease. In this work, several mathematical models are proposed to represent SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in infected patients. Considering different starting times of infection, parameters sets that represent infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 are computed and compared with other viral infections that can also cause pandemics.

Based on the target cell model, SARS-CoV-2 infecting time between susceptible cells (mean of 30 days approximately) is much slower than those reported for Ebola (about 3 times slower) and influenza (60 times slower). The within-host reproductive number for SARS-CoV-2 is consistent to the values of influenza infection (1.7-5.35). The best model to fit the data was including immune responses, which suggest a slow cell response peaking between 5 to 10 days post onset of symptoms. The model with eclipse phase, time in a latent phase before becoming productively infected cells, was not supported. Interestingly, both, the target cell model and the model with immune responses, predict that virus may replicate very slowly in the first days after infection, and it could be below detection levels during the first 4 days post infection. A quantitative comprehension of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and the estimation of standard parameters of viral infections is the key contribution of this pioneering work.","Hernandez Vargas, E.

This single step sample-to-result test method has been seamlessly integrated in an inexpensive, scalable, pre-programmable and portable instrument, resulting in a generic platform technology for detecting nucleic acid from a wide variety of pathogens. The test exhibited high sensitivity and specificity of detection when assessed using 200 double-blind patient samples for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), reporting a positive and negative percent agreement of 94.6% and 98% respectively. We also established its efficacy in detecting influenza-A infection, performing the diagnosis at the point of collection with uncompromised detection rigor.

We developed and validated new anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and IgA ELISA tests (ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 ELISA, DIESSE Diagnostica Senese S.p.a.) based on whole-virus antigens. We used a total of 553 serum samples including samples from COVID-19 suspected and confirmed cases, healthy donors, and patients positive for other infections or autoimmune conditions. Overall, the assays showed good concordance with the indirect immunofluorescence reference test in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Especially for IgG and IgA, we observed high sensitivity (92.5 and 93.6%, respectively); specificity was high (>96%) for all antibody types ELISAs. In addition, sensitivity was linked to the days from symptoms onset (DSO) due to the seroconversion window, and for ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA ELISAs resulted 100% in those samples collected after 10 and 12 DSO, respectively. The results showed that ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 ELISAs may represent a valid option for both diagnostic and epidemiological purposes, covering all different antibody types developed in SARS-CoV-2 immune response.","Colavita, F.; Brogi, A.; Lapa, D.; Bordi, L.; Matusali, G.; Meschi, S.; Marsella, P.; Tesi, G.; Bandini, T.; Di Caro, A.; Capobianchi, M.

21915,A Dynamic Bayesian Model for Identifying High-Mortality Risk in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients,"IntroductionAs COVID-19 hospitalization rates remain high, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic factors to improve treatment. Our analysis, to our knowledge, is one of the first to quantify the risk associated with dynamic clinical measurements taken throughout the course of hospitalization.

MethodsWe collected data for 553 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital whose eventual outcomes were known. The data collected for the patients included demographics, comorbidities and laboratory values taken at admission and throughout the course of hospitalization. We trained multivariate Markov prognostic models to identify high-risk patients at admission along with a dynamic measure of risk incorporating time-dependent changes in patients laboratory values.

ResultsFrom the set of factors available upon admission, the Markov model determined that age >80 years, history of coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increased mortality risk. The lab values upon admission most associated with mortality included neutrophil percentage, RBC, RDW, protein levels, platelets count, albumin levels and MCHC. Incorporating dynamic changes in lab values throughout hospitalization lead to dramatic gains in the predictive accuracy of the model and indicated a catalogue of variables for determining high-risk patients including eosinophil percentage, WBC, platelets, pCO2, RDW, LUC count, alkaline phosphatase and albumin.

ConclusionOur prognostic model highlights the nuance of determining risk for COVID-19 patients and indicates that, rather than a single variable, a range of factors (at different points in hospitalization) are needed for effective risk stratification.","Momeni-Boroujeni, A.; Mendoza, R.; Stopard, I.

15194,Longitudinal analysis of the utility of liver biochemistry in hospitalised COVID-19 patients as prognostic markers,"Background: COVID-19, the clinical syndrome caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, has been associated with deranged liver biochemistry in studies from China, Italy and the USA. However, the clinical utility of liver biochemistry as a prognostic marker of outcome for COVID-19 is currently debated. Methods: We extracted routinely collected clinical data from a large teaching hospital in the UK, matching 585 hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients to 1165 hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-negative patients for age, gender, ethnicity and pre-existing comorbidities. Liver biochemistry was compared between groups over time to determine whether derangement was associated with outcome. Results: 26.8% (157/585) of COVID-19 patients died, compared to 11.9% (139/1165) in the non-COVID-19 group (p<0.001). At presentation, a significantly higher proportion of the COVID-19 group had elevated alanine aminotransferase (20.7% vs. 14.6%, p=0.004) and hypoalbuminaemia (58.7% vs. 35.0%, p<0.001), compared to the non-COVID-19 group. Within the COVID-19 group, those with hypoalbuminaemia at presentation had 1.83-fold increased hazards of death compared to those with normal albumin (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.83, 95% CI 1.25-2.67), whilst the hazard of death was ~4-fold higher in those aged [&ge;]75 years (adjusted HR 3.96, 95% CI 2.59-6.04) and ~3-fold higher in those with pre-existing liver disease (adjusted HR 3.37, 95% CI 1.58-7.16). In the COVID-19 group, alkaline phosphatase increased (R=0.192, p<0.0001) and albumin declined (R=-0.123, p=0.0004) over time in patients who died. We did not find a significant association between other liver biochemistry and death. Conclusion: In this UK population, liver biochemistry is commonly deranged in patients with COVID-19 but only baseline low albumin and a rising alkaline phosphatase over time are prognostic markers for death.","Wang, T.; Smith, D.

22409,Modafinil for Wakefulness in the Critical Care Units: A Case Series including COVID-19 Patients at a Tertiary Care Saudi Hospital,"Cognitive improvement after critical illness is complex. Neuro-stimulants are used to speed up physical and mental processes through the increase in arousal, and wakefulness. In this case series, we reviewed the literature and described the effect of modafinil for wakefulness in a cohort of adult patients admitted to our COVID and non-COVID intensive care unit (ICU) between January 2017 and June 2020. A total of 8 patients included; 3 admitted to COVID-19, 4 surgical, and 1 transplant ICU. Obstructive sleep apnea was noted in 2 (25%), 2 patients (25 %) had an initial neuroimaging that showed hemorrhagic stroke, and 1 (12.5%) showed ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation. Modafinil 100-200 mg daily was started for a median duration of 4 days and the median initiation time in relation to ICU admission was 11 (IQR 9-17) days. Glasgow coma Scale improvement was noted on 5 patients (62.5%). The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 17.5 (IQR 15-31.75) days, and the median ICU stay was 28.5 (IQR 20.25-48) days. All-cause mortality rate was 25 % at 28 days and 62.5 % at 90 days. Modafinil prevented tracheostomy in 1 COVID-19 patient. No significant adverse drug reactions were documented. In our case series, we described our experience for modafinil use for wakefulness in ICU ventilated patients including COVID-19 patients. Based on our observations, the known effects of modafinil, and its safety profile, it holds the potential to facilitate recovery from cognitive impairment. Larger studies are warranted to fully evaluate its role for this indication.","Amer, M. R.; Bawazeer, M.; Butt, A. S.; Dahhan, T. I.; Kseibi, E.; Jamil, M.

25544,COVID-Nets: Deep CNN Architectures for Detecting COVID-19 Using Chest CT Scans,"This paper introduces two novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for automated detection of COVID-19. The first model, CovidResNet, is inspired by the deep residual network (ResNet) architecture. The second model, CovidDenseNet, exploits the power of densely connected convolutional networks (DenseNet). The proposed networks are designed to provide fast and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 using computed tomography (CT) images for the multi-class and binary classification tasks. The architectures are utilized in a first experimental study on the SARS-CoV-2 CT-scan dataset, which contains 4173 CT images for 210 subjects structured in a subject-wise manner for three different classes. First, we train and test the networks to differentiate COVID-19, non-COVID-19 viral infections, and healthy. Second, we train and test the networks on binary classification with three different scenarios: COVID-19 vs. healthy, COVID-19 vs. other non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia vs. healthy. Our proposed models achieve up to 93.96% accuracy, 99.13% precision, 94% sensitivity, 97.73% specificity, and a 95.80% F1-score for binary classification, and up to 83.89% accuracy, 80.36% precision, 82% sensitivity, 92% specificity, and a 81% F1-score for the three-class classification tasks. The experimental results reveal the validity and effectiveness of the proposed networks in automated COVID-19 detection.

15669,Epidemiological characterization of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and positivity in subsequent RT-PCR tests in the United Arab Emirates,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases could be symptomatic or asymptomatic. In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the identified COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases are yet to be characterized. In this study, we characterized the first cohort of COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases reported in the Abu Dhabi Emirate, UAE, according to symptomatic state, and identified factors associated with the symptomatic state. Also, the strength of association between the symptomatic state and testing positive in three subsequent RT-PCR testing rounds was examined and quantified.

MethodWe analyzed data collected from the first cohort of the RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the health authorities in the Abu Dhabi Emirate - UAE between February 28 and April 08, 2020. Self-reported sociodemographic, working status, travel history, and chronic comorbidities of 1,249 COVID-19 cases were analyzed according to symptomatic state (symptomatic and asymptomatic). After the first RT-PCR confirmatory test, the results of three subsequent testing rounds were also analyzed.

ResultsA total of 791 confirmed cases with a mean age of 35.6 years{+/-}12.7 (range: 1-81 years) and information on symptomatic state were analyzed. Nearly, 56.0% were asymptomatic cases. The most frequent two symptoms were fever (58.0%) and cough (41.0%). The mean age of symptomatic (36.3 year {+/-}12.6SD) was significantly higher than that of asymptomatic cases (34.5 year {+/-}12.7SD). Compared to non-working populations, working in public places (aOR, 1.76, 95% CI: 1.11-2.80), healthcare settings (aOR, 2.09, 95% CI: 1.01-4.31), or in aviation and tourism sector (aOR, 2.24, 95% CI: 1.14-4.40), were independently associated with symptomatic state. Reporting at least one chronic comorbidity was also associated with symptomatic cases (aOR, 1.76, 5% CI: 1.03-3.01). Compared to asymptomatic, symptomatic COVID-19 cases had consistent odds of two or more of testing positive to COVID-19 in three subsequent testing rounds.

ConclusionsA substantial proportion of the diagnosed COVID-19 cases in the Abu Dhabi Emirate was asymptomatic. Quarantine of asymptomatic cases along with prevention measures and raising awareness of populations working in high-risk settings is warranted. Further follow up research is needed to understand viral clearance and clinical outcomes according to the symptomatic state of the COVID-19 cases.","Al-Rifai, R. H.; Acuna, J.; Al Hossany, F.

19880,Vitamins D2 and D3 have overlapping but different effects on human gene expression revealed through analysis of blood transcriptomes in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled food-fortification trial,"For the first time, we report the influence of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 on genome-wide gene expression in whole blood from healthy women representing two ethnic groups, white European and South Asian. In this randomised placebo-controlled trial, participants were given daily physiological doses (15 {micro}g) of either vitamin D2 or D3 for 12 weeks and changes in the transcriptome were compared relative to the transcriptome at baseline. While there was some overlap in the repertoire of differentially expressed genes after supplementation with each vitamin D source, most changes were specific to either vitamin D3 or vitamin D2, suggesting that each form of the vitamin may have different effects on human physiology. Notably, following vitamin D3 supplementation, the majority of changes in gene expression reflected a down-regulation in the activity of genes, many encoding components of the innate and adaptive immune systems. These are consistent with the emerging concept that vitamin D orchestrates a shift in the immune system towards a more tolerogenic status. Moreover, divergent changes were observed following supplementation with either vitamin D3 or vitamin D2 for gene expression associated with type 1 and type 2 interferon activity. This is particularly intriguing as interferons play a critical role in the innate response to infection and aberrant type 1 interferon signalling is implicated in severe COVID-19 disease. The observed differences in gene expression after supplementation with vitamin D2 compared with vitamin D3 warrant a more intensive investigation of the biological effects of the two forms of vitamin D on human physiology.

Significance statementsThis study suggests that the influence of vitamins D2 and D3 on human physiology may not be the same, as deduced from differences in gene expression within whole blood.

South Asian participants were found to respond differently to vitamin D supplementation at the transcriptome level from white Europeans.

The differentially expressed immune pathways identified in this study are consistent with vitamin D orchestrating a more tolerogenic immune status and this could be relevant in the context of the severity of immune response to viral infections such as Covid-19.

The potential relevance of this study to severe Covid-19 disease is highlighted by our observed enhancement of type 1 interferon signalling by vitamin D3, but not vitamin D2.","Durrant, L.

5256,"Knowledge, attitude, practice and perception regarding COVID-19 among students in Bangladesh: Survey in Rajshahi University","BackgroundThe number of infection and death by COVID-19 has been rapidly increasing since December 2019 in all over the world. Until now, there is no specific treatment or vaccine for this disease; WHO suggests only some protective measures like maintaining social distance, staying home, washing hands with soap or sanitizer, wearing mask etc. The objective of this study was to survey knowledge, attitude, practice and perception regarding COVID-19 among students in Rajshahi University, Bangladesh.

MethodsWe collected data from 305 students of Rajshahi University for this cross-sectional study using mixed sampling from March 11 to March 19, 2020. Frequency distribution, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used in this study.

ResultsOut of 305 participants, 224 (73.4%) and 81 (26.6%) were male and female students respectively. The study revealed that Rajshahi university students had average knowledge on symptoms, protective way and transmission of COVID-19. Female students were more knowledgeable than male. More than one third of the students had negative attitude to avoiding public transport and going out to public places with friends and family. The practice of students practice during our data collection period and in future was not satisfactory. More than one third of students were not keen to stay at home and avoid going to crowded places. The perception towards COVID-19 was not good; they had no idea whether the outbreak would affect their daily routine, study and financial matters, study field work and restrict leisure time of meeting family and relatives.

ConclusionsWe found that general knowledge, attitude, practice and perception of the university students regarding COVID-19 were not satisfactory. This indicated that the situation was worse among common people. In Bangladesh, the number of healthcare providers is insufficient. University students can be employed as potential workforce to create awareness among mass people on prevention of COVID-19.","Wadood, M. A.; Mamun, A.; Rafi, M. A.; Islam, M.

ACE-I/ARBs may counteract this mechanism, but their association with COVID-19 outcomes has not been specifically tested in the AA population.

ObjectivesTo determine whether the use of ACE-I/ARBs is associated with COVID-19 in-hospital mortality in AA compared with non-AA population.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsIn this observational, retrospective study, patient-level data were extracted from the Mount Sinai Health Systems (MSHS) electronic medical record (EMR) database, and 6,218 patients with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis from February 24 to May 31, 2020 were identified as ACE-I/ARB users.

ExposuresPatients with an active prescription from January 1, 2019 up to the date of admission for ACE-I/ARB (outpatient use) and patients administered ACE-I/ARB during hospitalization (in-hospital use) were identified.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, assessed in the entire, AA, and non-AA population.

ResultsOf the 6,218 COVID-19 patients, 1,138 (18.3%) were ACE-I/ARB users. In a multivariate logistic regression model, ACE-I/ARB use was independently associated with reduced risk of in-hospital mortality in the entire population (OR, 0.655; 95% CI, 0.505-0.850; P=0.001), AA population (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.249-0.779; P=0.005), and non-AA population (OR, 0.748, 95% CI, 0.553-1.012, P=0.06). In the AA population, in-hospital use of ACE-I/ARBs was associated with improved mortality (OR, 0.378; 95% CI, 0.188-0.766; P=0.006) while outpatient use was not (OR, 0.889; 95% CI, 0.375-2.158; P=0.812). When analyzing each medication class separately, ARB in-hospital use was significantly associated with reduced in-hospital mortality in the AA population (OR, 0.196; 95% CI, 0.074-0.516; P=0.001), while ACE-I use was not associated with impact on mortality in any population.

Conclusion and RelevanceIn-hospital use of ARBs was associated with a significant reduction in in-hospital mortality among COVID-19-positive AA patients. These results support further investigation of ARBs to improve outcomes in AA patients at high risk for COVID-19-related mortality.","Li, S.; Sarangarajan, R.; Jun, T.; Kao, Y.-H.; Wang, Z.; Schadt, E.; Kiebish, M.

13139,Indirect Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Activity and Outcomes of Transcatheter and Surgical Treatment of Severe Aortic Stenosis in England,"BackgroundAortic stenosis requires timely treatment with either surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This study aimed to investigate the indirect impact of COVID-19 on national SAVR and TAVR activity and outcomes.

MethodsThe UK TAVR Registry and the National Adult Cardiac Surgery Audit were used to identify all TAVR and SAVR procedures in England, between January 2017 and June 2020. The number of isolated AVR, AVR+coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, AVR+other surgery and TAVR procedures per month was calculated. Separate negative binomial regression models were fit to monthly procedural counts, with functions of time as covariates, to estimate the expected change in activity during COVID-19.

ResultsWe included 13376 TAVR cases, 12328 isolated AVR cases, 7829 AVR+CABG cases, and 6014 AVR+Other cases. Prior to March 2020 (UK lockdown), monthly TAVR activity was rising, with a slight decrease in SAVR activity during 2019. We observed a rapid and significant drop in TAVR and SAVR activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for elective cases. Cumulatively, over the period March to June 2020, we estimated an expected 2294 (95% CI 1872, 2716) cases of severe aortic stenosis who have not received treatment.

ConclusionThis study has demonstrated a significant decrease in TAVR and SAVR activity in England following the COVID-19 outbreak. This situation should be monitored closely, to ensure that monthly activity rapidly returns to expected levels. There is potential for significant backlog in the near-to-medium term, and potential for increased mortality in this population.","Martin, G.

8609,"The Neutrophil Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Platelet Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) and routine hematological parameters of COVID-19 Patient : A perspective of the Indian scenario from a frontline pilot study of 32 COVID-19 cases in a Tertiary Care Institute of North India","IntroductionThe corona virus disease 2019(COVID-19) is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 and is declared as a global pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO). Various hematological parameters alteration has been documented in the Chinese literature in SARS-Cov-2 infection. However, there is a need for research to evaluate the pattern of the hematological parameters of COVID-19 patients in the Indian population.

Aims & ObjectivesThe objective of the study is to see the Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Platelet Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR), and other hematological parameters alteration of COVID-19 patients along with their clinical course in the Indian scenario.

MethodsA single-center prospective study of 32 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Super Speciality Pediatric Hospital & Post Graduate Teaching Institute NOIDA, from March to April, were enrolled for the study. The demographic date, the clinical status of the patients during admission and follow up, baseline, and follow up hematological findings were recorded. Statistical analysis of the data was carried out, and relevant findings were presented.

ResultsDemographic characterization shows a mean age of 37.7 years, male (41.9%),female (58.1%)with majority patients are mildly symptomatic to asymptomatic(93%). The CBC values and NLR, PLR at baseline between the male and the female patients, are not showing any statistically significant difference as the 95% C.I. A statistically significant increment in the lab parameters is observed in follow-up visits.

ConclusionMajority of the patients are younger and have mild clinical presentation with female predominance. Pediatric cases have mild symptomology. Baseline CBC findings show mild neutrophilia, lymphopenia, eosinopenia and normal to mild thrombocytopenia. An increase in CBC parameters, NLR was noted in follow up cases. Anemia was not noted in baseline CBC and in follow up group.

14666,"Health professionals practice and associated factors towards precautionary measures for COVID-19 pandemic in public health facilities of Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study","IntroductionCoronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease, which caused by a novel coronavirus. The disease disrupts health systems and resulting in social, political, and economic crises. Health professionals are in front of this pandemic and always work in a high-risk environment. Currently, there is no vaccine or drug for the disease. Therefore, strictly practicing precautionary measures are the only option to save the life. Some studies reported health professionals practice of precautionary measures for COVID-19. Nevertheless, a few have identified factors affecting. As such, this study aimed to fill those research gaps in the study setting.

MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, 428 health professionals were involved from the public health facilities of the Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia. A simple random sampling method was employed, and the data collected by the interviewer-administered Open Data Kit survey tool and observational checklist. The data analyzed in Stata version 15 and a binary logistic regression model used to identify factors. In this study, a statistically significant association was declared at P < 0.05.

ResultsIn this study, 35.3% (95%CI: 30.7%, 39.8%) of health professionals had a good practice on precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. Use hand sanitizer or wash hands continuously with soap and water (68.9%), cover nose and mouth with a tissue during sneezing or coughing (67.3%), and use facemask in crowds (56.8%) were the most common practice reported by study participants. Marital status, being married (AOR = 1.84, 95%CI: 1.06, 3.18), good knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic (AOR = 2.02, 95%CI: 1.02, 3.18), and positive attitude towards precautionary measures for COVID-19 were factors showed signification association with the practice.

ConclusionsThe magnitude of good practice of precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic among health professionals was low. As such, different interventions to improve the knowledge and attitude of health professionals in the health care system are highly needed to boost the practice and to advance service delivery.","Mersha, A.; Shibiru, S.; Girma, M.; Ayele, G.; Bante, A.; Kassa, M.; Abebe, S.; Shewangizaw, M.",2020-09-07,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.09.05.20188805,1,Abera Mersha,Arba Minch University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.20188805v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.20188805v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1371/journal.pone.0248272
14161,Evaluation of production lots of a rapid point-of-care lateral flow serological test intended for identification of IgM and IgG against the N-terminal part of the spike protein (S1) of SARS-CoV-2,"Background and objectivesSeveral antibody tests are available to detect SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies, many of which address different antigens. Rapid point-of-care (POC) tests have been doubted due to an eventual risk of production errors, although it is unstudied whether such error would affect test sensitivity and/or specificity. We aimed to evaluate two separate production lots of a commercially available test intended for rapid detection of IgM and IgG against the N-terminal part of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1).

Materials and methodsSerum samples from individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, by RT-PCR and/or serology, and pre-COVID-19 negative control sera gathered from a biobank during 2018 were collected. The presence of anti-S1 IgM/IgG was verified by an in-house Luminex-based serological assay, serving as reference method. The index test was a commercially available rapid POC-test (the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette [Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech Co Ltd, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China/Healgen Scientific, LLC, U.S.A.]).

ResultsOne hundred samples were verified positive for anti-S1 IgG (median fluorescence intensity (MFI) [&ge;]900) and 74 for anti-S1 IgM (MFI [&ge;]700), confirmed by RT-PCR (n=90) and/or serology (n=89). None of the negative controls (n=200; MFI <300) had SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 IgM, while one tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 IgG. For the two lots, the sensitivities of the rapid test were 93.2% (69/74; 95% CI: 85.1% - 97.1%) and 87.8% (65/74; 95% CI: 78.5% - 93.5%) for IgM, respectively 93.0% (93/100; 95% CI: 86.3% - 96.6%) and 100.0% for IgG (100/100; 95% CI: 96.3% - 100.0%). The specificity for both lots was 100% for IgM (200/200; 95% CI: 98.1% - 100%) and 99.5% for IgG (199/200; 95% CI: 97.2% - 99.9%). The positive predictive value was 100% for IgM and 98.9% and 99.0% for IgG. The negative predictive value was 95.7% and 97.6% for IgM, and 96.6% and 100.0% for IgG.

ConclusionThe rapid POC-test used in this study is suitable to assess SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 specific IgM/IgG, as a measure of previous virus exposure on an individual level. While the specificity was not affected by production lot, external validation of separate lots of rapid POC-tests is encouraged to ensure high sensitivity before market introduction.","Hoffman, T.; Kolstad, L.; Ronnberg, B.; Lundkvist, A.",2020-09-01,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.27.20182923,1,Ake Lundkvist,Uppsala University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.27.20182923v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.27.20182923v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
14100,SARS-CoV-2 induces inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis and downmodulation of HLA-DR in human monocytes,"Infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been associated with leukopenia and uncontrolled inflammatory response in critically ill patients. A better comprehension of SARS-CoV-2-induced monocytes death is essential for the identification of therapies capable to control the hyper-inflammation and reduce viral replication in patients with COVID-19. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 induces inflammasome activation and cell death by pyroptosis in human monocytes, experimentally infected and in patients under intensive care. Pyroptosis was dependent on caspase-1 engagement, prior to IL-1{beta} production and inflammatory cell death. Monocytes exposed to SARS-CoV-2 downregulate HLA-DR, suggesting a potential limitation to orchestrate the immune response. Our results originally describe the mechanism by which monocytes, a central cellular component recruited from peripheral blood to respiratory tract, succumb in patients with severe 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and emphasize the need for identifying anti-inflammatory and antiviral strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2-induced pyroptosis.","Ferreira, A.

22834,Leveraging genetic data to elucidate the relationship between Covid-19 and ischemic stroke,"BackgroundThe relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and ischemic stroke is poorly defined. We aimed to leverage genetic data to investigate reported associations.

MethodsGenetic association estimates for liability to Covid-19 and cardiovascular traits were obtained from large-scale consortia. Analyses primarily focused on critical Covid-19, defined as hospitalization with Covid-19 requiring respiratory support or resulting in death. Cross-trait linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to estimate genetic correlations of critical Covid-19 with ischemic stroke, other related cardiovascular outcomes, and risk factors common to both Covid-19 and cardiovascular disease (body mass index, smoking and chronic inflammation, estimated using C-reactive protein). Mendelian randomization analysis was performed to investigate whether liability to critical Covid-19 was associated with increased risk of any of the cardiovascular outcomes for which genetic correlation was identified.

ResultsThere was evidence of genetic correlation between critical Covid-19 and ischemic stroke (rg=0.29, FDR p-value=4.65x10-3), body mass index (rg=0.21, FDR-p-value=6.26x10-6) and C-reactive protein (rg=0.20, FDR-p-value=1.35x10-4), but none of the other considered traits. In Mendelian randomization analysis, liability to critical Covid-19 was associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR] per logOR increase in genetically predicted critical Covid-19 liability 1.03, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.06, p-value=0.03). Similar estimates were obtained when considering ischemic stroke subtypes. Consistent estimates were also obtained when performing statistical sensitivity analyses more robust to the inclusion of pleiotropic variants, including multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses adjusting for potential genetic confounding through body mass index, smoking and chronic inflammation. There was no evidence to suggest that genetic liability to ischemic stroke increased the risk of critical Covid-19.

ConclusionsThese data support that liability to critical Covid-19 is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. The host response predisposing to severe Covid-19 is likely to increase the risk of ischemic stroke, independent of other potentially mitigating risk factors.","Zuber, V.; Cameron, A.; Myserlis, E.

6836,Early outcomes of tocilizumab in adults hospitalized with severe COVID19. An initial report from the Vall dHebron COVID19 prospective cohort study.,"BackgroundModulation of the immune system to prevent lung injury is being widely used against the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) despite the scarcity of evidence.

MethodsWe report the preliminary results from the Vall dHebron prospective cohort study at Vall dHebron University Hospital, in Barcelona (Spain), including all consecutive patients who had a confirmed infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and who were treated with tocilizumab until March 25th. The primary endpoint was mortality at 7 days after tocilizumab administration. Secondary endpoints were admission to the intensive care unit, development of ARDS and respiratory insufficiency among others.

Results82 patients with COVID-19 received at least one dose of tocilizumab. The mean ({+/-} SD) age was 59.1 (19.8) years, 63% were male, 22% were of non-Spanish ancestry, and the median (IQR) age-adjusted Charlson index at baseline was 3 (1-4) points. Respiratory failure and ARDS developed in 62 (75.6%) and 45 (54.9%) patients, respectively. Median time from symptom onset to ARDS development was 8 (5-11) days. The median time from symptom onset to the first dose of tocilizumab was 9 (7-11) days. Mortality at 7 days was 26.8%. Hazard ratio for mortality was 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3 to 8.5 (age-adjusted hazard ratio for mortality 2.1; 95% CI, 0.8 to 5.8) if tocilizumab was administered after the onset of ARDS.

ConclusionTime from lung injury onset to tocilizumab administration may be critical to patient recovery. Our preliminary data could inform bedside decisions until more data from clinical trials becomes available.

22222,Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and symptoms in an Irish Healthcare Worker (HCW) setting: Results of the COVID Antibody Staff Testing (CAST) Study,"ObjectivesThis study examined the natural history, including incidence and prevalence, of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies serially up to 6 months post infection in Irish Healthcare Workers (HCWs) at an academic tertiary maternity hospital, during the first pandemic peak from March to September 2020.

DesignThis single centre observational study profiled SARS-CoV-2 incidence and infection using viral RNA detected using oro/nasopharyngeal swabs accompanied by serological assessment of study participants for the presence of S SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Participant demographics were also collected alongside information on clinical symptoms and time to recovery. Real time polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) for viral RNA SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed using the Allplex SARS-CoV-2 three gene target 2019-nCoV assay (SeeGene Inc., Rep. of Korea) or the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay on the GeneXpert platform (Cepheid, USA). Blood samples were obtained at the time of initial swab and at up to 4 time points thereafter, for the serological assessment of antibodies against both the spike and nucleocapsid protein antigens of SARS-CoV-2. Serological response was measured using the Captia Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (IgG) ELISA (Trinity Biotech) as part of a clinical performance evaluation. Two other testing methods were also used; the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) assay (EuroImmun) and the Abbott Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG 75 kit on the Architect i2000SR instrument (Abbott Laboratories).

SettingAcademic Tertiary Maternity Hospital in Dublin, Ireland.

ParticipantsWe invited symptomatic and asymptomatic healthcare workers employed at the Rotunda Maternity Hospital to participate in the CAST study.

Main Outcome MeasuresThe CAST study aimed to examine incidence and clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs and to determine the presence and longevity of antibodies in this group. We also sought to examine the clinical utility of the Captia Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (IgG) ELISA (Trinity Biotech) and to compare it to the current """"accepted"""" gold standard platform in Ireland.

ResultsBy July 2020, 398 molecular tests had been completed on symptomatic staff with clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this cohort, 14% (n=54/398) had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by RT-PCR. The CAST study enrolled 137 HCWs with 86 participants symptomatic at time of swab collection and a further 51 asymptomatic control participants. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 52% (n=45/86) symptomatic study participants and serological positivity was confirmed in 98% (n=44/45) of those participants. Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 RNA infection was detected in 4% (n=2/51) of control participants with a seropositivity rate in this group of 8% (n=4/51). We demonstrated that 95% of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive participants have detectable levels of antibodies at 100 days post infection, which persisted in 91% of participants at day 160+. Ongoing symptoms up to six months post infection were present in 50% of study participants with positive PCR and serology results. These data will be important to consider for long-term workforce planning in a healthcare setting, as the ongoing pandemic continues.

FundingThe CAST study was supported by the Rotunda Hospital and Trinity Biotech.","Griffin, J.; Tully, E.; Cody, F.; Edwards, K.; Moran, K.; Leblanc, D.; Oloughlin, J.; Mcloughlin, R.; Cummins, R.; Breen, S.; Drew, R.; Natin, D.; Malone, F.",2021-02-15,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.02.10.20248323,1,Elizabeth C Tully,RCSI  Rotunda Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.10.20248323v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.10.20248323v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
15137,"Safety and Efficacy of the combined use of ivermectin, dexamethasone, enoxaparin and aspirin against COVID-19","From the first outbreak in Wuhan (China) in December 2019, until today the number of deaths worldwide due to the coronavirus pandemic exceeds eight hundred thousand people and the number of infected people arises to more than 25 million. No treatment tested worldwide has shown unquestionable efficacy in the fight against COVID 19, according to NICE reports. We have designed an experimental treatment called IDEA based on four affordable drugs already available on the market in Argentina, based on the following rationale: -Ivermectin solution at a relatively high dose to lower the viral load in all stages of COVID 19 -Dexamethasone 4-mg injection, as anti-inflammatory drug to treat hyperinflammatory reaction to COVID-infection -Enoxaparin injection as anticoagulant to treat hypercoagulation in severe cases. -Aspirin 250-mg tablets to prevent hypercoagulation in mild and moderate cases Except for Ivermection oral solution, which was used in a higher dose than approved for parasitosis, all other drugs were used in the already approved dose and indication. Regarding Ivermectin safety, several oral studies have shown it to be safe even when used at daily doses much higher than those approved already. A clinical study has been conducted on COVID-19 patients at Eurnekian Hospital in the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The study protocol and its final outcomes are described in this article. Results were compared with published data and data from patients admitted to the hospital receiving other treatments. None of the patient presenting mild symptoms needed to be hospitalized. Only one patient died (0.59 % of all included patients vs. 2.1 % overall mortality for the disease in Argentina today; 3.1 % of hospitalized patients vs. 26.8 % mortality in published data). IDEA protocol appears to be a useful alternative to prevent disease progression of COVID-19 when applied to mild cases and to decrease mortality in patients at all stages of the disease with a favorable risk-benefit ratio.","Carvallo, H.

20600,Optimal design for phase 2 studies of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs,"There is no agreed methodology for pharmacometric assessment of candidate SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs. The most widely used measure of virological response in clinical trials to date is the time to viral clearance assessed by serial qPCR. We posited that rate of viral clearance would have better discriminatory value. Using a pharmacodynamic model fit to individual SARS-CoV-2 qPCR data from 46 prospectively followed uncomplicated COVID-19 infections, we simulated viral load data and showed that rate of viral clearance is a uniformly superior endpoint as compared to time to clearance with respect to type 2 error. Rate of clearance is not dependent on initial viral load or assay sensitivity. We apply our approach to data from a randomised controlled trial of ivermectin. Pharmacometric antiviral assessments should be conducted in early illness with serial qPCR samples taken over one week. Response-adaptive trials using rate of clearance can identify promising antiviral interventions rapidly.","Watson, J. A.; Kissler, S.; Day, N. P.; Grad, Y. H.; White, N.

9029,The impact of school reopening on the spread of COVID-19 in England,"By mid-May, cases of COVID-19 in the UK had been declining for over a month; a multi-phase emergence from lockdown was planned, including a scheduled partial reopening of schools on 1st June. Although evidence suggests that children generally display mild symptoms, the size of the school-age population means the total impact of reopening schools is unclear. Here, we present work from mid-May that focused on the imminent opening of schools and consider what these results imply for future policy.

We compared eight strategies for reopening primary and secondary schools in England. Modifying a transmission model fitted to UK SARS-CoV-2 data, we assessed how reopening schools affects contact patterns, anticipated secondary infections and the relative change in the reproduction number, R. We determined the associated public health impact and its sensitivity to changes in social-distancing within the wider community.

We predicted reopening schools with half-sized classes or focused on younger children was unlikely to push R above one. Older children generally have more social contacts, so reopening secondary schools results in more cases than reopening primary schools, while reopening both could have pushed R above one in some regions. Reductions in community social-distancing were found to outweigh and exacerbate any impacts of reopening. In particular, opening schools when the reproduction number R is already above one generates the largest increase in cases.

Our work indicates that while any school reopening will result in increased mixing and infection amongst children and the wider population, reopening schools alone in June was unlikely to push R above one. Ultimately, reopening decisions are a difficult trade-off between epidemiological consequences and the emotional, educational and developmental needs of children. Into the future, there are difficult questions about what controls can be instigated such that schools can remain open if cases increase.","Keeling, M. J.; Tildesley, M. J.; Atkins, B.

18950,Forecasting COVID-19 cases: A comparative analysis between Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Networks,"When the entire world is waiting restlessly for a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine that could soon become a reality, numerous countries around the globe are grappling with unprecedented surges of new COVID-19 cases. As the number of new cases is skyrocketing, pandemic fatigue and public apathy towards different intervention strategies are posing new challenges to the government officials to combat the pandemic. Henceforth, it is indispensable for the government officials to understand the future dynamics of COVID-19 flawlessly in order to develop strategic preparedness and resilient response planning. In light of the above circumstances, probable future outbreak scenarios in Brazil, Russia and the United kingdom have been sketched in this study with the help of four deep learning models: long short term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), convolutional neural network (CNN) and multivariate convolutional neural network (MCNN). In our analysis, CNN algorithm has outperformed other deep learning models in terms of validation accuracy and forecasting consistency. It has been unearthed in our study that CNN can provide robust long term forecasting results in time series analysis due to its capability of essential features learning, distortion invariance and temporal dependence learning. However, the prediction accuracy of LSTM algorithm has been found to be poor as it tries to discover seasonality and periodic intervals from any time series dataset, which were absent in our studied countries. Our study has highlighted the promising validation of using convolutional neural networks instead of recurrent neural networks when it comes to forecasting with very few features and less amount of historical data.","Nabi, K.

16938,Early prognostication of COVID-19 to guide hospitalisation versus outpatient monitoring using a point-of-test risk prediction score,"IntroductionRisk factors of adverse outcomes in COVID-19 are defined but stratification of mortality using non-laboratory measured scores, particularly at the time of pre-hospital SARS-CoV-2 testing, is lacking.

MethodsMultivariate regression with bootstrapping was used to identify independent mortality predictors in a derivation cohort of COVID-19 patients. Predictions were externally validated in a large random sample of the ISARIC cohort (N=14,231) and a smaller cohort from Aintree (N=290).

Results983 patients (median age 70, IQR 53-83; in-hospital mortality 29.9%) were recruited over an 11-week study period. Through sequential modelling, a 5-predictor score termed SOARS (SpO2, Obesity, Age, Respiratory rate, Stroke history) was developed to correlate COVID-19 severity across low, moderate and high strata of mortality risk. The score discriminated well for in-hospital death, with area under the receiver operating characteristic values of 0.82, 0.80 and 0.74 in the derivation, Aintree and ISARIC validation cohorts respectively. Its predictive accuracy (calibration) in both external cohorts was consistently higher in patients with milder disease (SOARS 0-1), the same individuals who could be identified for safe outpatient monitoring. Prediction of a non-fatal outcome in this group was accompanied by high score sensitivity (99.2%) and negative predictive value (95.9%).

ConclusionThe SOARS score uses constitutive and readily assessed individual characteristics to predict the risk of COVID-19 death. Deployment of the score could potentially inform clinical triage in pre-admission settings where expedient and reliable decision-making is key. The resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission provides an opportunity to further validate and update its performance.","Chua, F.; Vancheeswaran, R.; Draper, A.; Vaghela, T.; Knight, M.; Moghal, R.; Singh, J.; Spencer, L.

12729,Clinical Utility of a Highly Sensitive Lateral Flow Immunoassay as determined by Titer Analysis for the Detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies at the Point-of-Care,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), became a pandemic in early 2020. Lateral flow immunoassays for antibody testing have been viewed as a cheap and rapidly deployable method for determining previous infection with SARS-CoV-2; however, these assays have shown unacceptably low sensitivity. We report on nine lateral flow immunoassays currently available and compare their titer sensitivity in serum to a best-practice enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and viral neutralization assay. For a small group of PCR-positive, we found two lateral flow immunoassay devices with titer sensitivity roughly equal to the ELISA; these devices were positive for all PCR-positive patients harboring SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. One of these devices was deployed in Northern Italy to test its sensitivity and specificity in a real-world clinical setting. Using the device with fingerstick blood on a cohort of 27 hospitalized PCR-positive patients and seven hospitalized controls, ROC curve analysis gave AUC values of 0.7646 for IgG. For comparison, this assay was also tested with saliva from the same patient population and showed reduced discrimination between cases and controls with AUC values of 0.6841 for IgG. Furthermore, during viral neutralization testing, one patient was discovered to harbor autoantibodies to ACE2, with implications for how immune responses are profiled. We show here through a proof-of-concept study that these lateral flow devices can be as analytically sensitive as ELISAs and adopted into hospital protocols; however, additional improvements to these devices remain necessary before their clinical deployment.","Haymond, A.; Mueller, C.; Steinberg, H.; Hodge, K.

24899,Do post-COVID-19 patients need a second dose of vaccine?,"Vaccination forms a key part of public health strategies to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 globally. In the UK, two vaccines (BNT162b2-mRNA produced by Pfizer, and ChAdOx-1-S produced by Oxford-AstraZeneca) have been licensed to date, and their administration is prioritised according to individual risk. This study forms part of a longitudinal assessment of participants SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels before and after vaccination. Our results confirm that there is little quantitative difference in the antibody titres achieved by the two vaccines. Our results also suggest that individuals who have previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2 achieve markedly higher antibody titres than those who are immunologically naive. This finding is useful to inform vaccine prioritisation strategies in the future: individuals with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be prioritised for a second vaccine inoculation.","Taubel, J.; Spencer, C.

5244,Lack of association between genetic variants at ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection and human quantitative phenotypes,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shows a wide variation in expression and severity of symptoms, from very mild or no symptomes, to flu-like symptoms, and in more severe cases, to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and even death. Large differences in outcome have also been observed between males and females. The causes for this variability are likely to be multifactorial, and to include genetics. The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the infection uses the human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell invasion, and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. Genetic variation in these two genes may thus modulate an individuals genetic predisposition to infection and virus clearance. While genetic data on COVID-19 patients is being gathered, we carried out a phenome-wide association scan (PheWAS) to investigate the role of these genes in other human phenotypes in the general population. We examined 178 quantitative phenotypes including cytokines and cardio-metabolic biomarkers, as well as 58 medications in 36,339 volunteers from the Lifelines population biobank, in relation to 1,273 genetic variants located in or near ACE2 and TMPRSS2. While none reached our threshold for significance, we observed a suggestive association of polymorphisms within the ACE2 gene with (1) the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) combination therapies (p=5.7x10-4), an association that is significantly stronger in females (pdiff=0.01), and (2) with the use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products (p=5.5x10-4). While these associations need to be confirmed in larger sample sizes, they suggest that these variants play a role in diseases such as hypertension and chronic inflammation that are often observed in the more severe COVID-19 cases. Further investigation of these genetic variants in the context of COVID-19 is thus promising for better understanding of disease variability.

9877,Artificial Intelligence for COVID-19 Risk Classification in Kidney Disease: Can Technology Unmask an Unseen Disease?,"BackgroundWe developed two unique machine learning (ML) models that predict risk of: 1) a major COVID-19 outbreak in the service county of a local HD population within following week, and 2) a hemodialysis (HD) patient having an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection that is identified after following 3 or more days.

MethodsWe used county-level data from United States population (March 2020) and HD patient data from a network of clinics (February-May 2020) to develop two ML models. First was a county-level model that used data from general and HD populations (21 variables); outcome of a COVID-19 outbreak in a dialysis service area was defined as a clinic being located in one of the national counties with the highest growth in COVID-19 positive cases (number and people per million (ppm)) in general population during 22-28 Mar 2020. Second was a patient-level model that used HD patient data (82 variables) to predict an individual having an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection that is identified in subsequent [&ge;]3 days.

ResultsAmong 1682 counties with dialysis clinics, 82 (4.9%) had a COVID-19 outbreak during 22-28 Mar 2020. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for the county-level model was 0.86 in testing dataset. Top predictor of a county experiencing an outbreak was the COVID-19 positive ppm in the general population in the prior week. In a select group (n=11,664) used to build the patient-level model, 28% of patients had COVID-19; prevalence was by design 10% in the testing dataset. AUROC for the patient-level model was 0.71 in the testing dataset. Top predictor of an HD patient having a SARS-CoV-2 infection was mean pre-HD body temperature in the prior week.

25010,Performance of vaccination with CoronaVac in a cohort of healthcare workers (HCW) - preliminary report,"BackgroundCoronaVac, a vaccine containing inactivated SARS-CoV-2, demonstrated efficacy of 50.39% 14 days or more after the 2nd dose.

The objective of this study is to report the occurrence of symptomatic COVID-19 in a cohort of HCW vaccinated with CoronaVac and to estimate its effectiveness.

MethodsCoronaVac was given to HCWs inHospital das Clinicas on 18-21 January, 2021 (epi week 3) (22,402 HCWs), and on 14-16 February, 2021 (epi week 7) (21,652 HCWs). Weekly cases of symptomatic COVID-19 were evaluated. Using the period from 2020 epi week 24 through 2021 epi week 2 (before vaccination), a Poisson regression was fit to model the HCWs with COVID-19 of the hospital, and the officially reported cases in the city of Sao Paulo. The predicted numbers of cases among HCWs for 2021 epi weeks 3-12 were then compared to the observed numbers of cases (after vaccination). Effectiveness was estimated for weeks 9-12 (2 to 5 weeks after the 2nd dose). 142 samples after vaccination were evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

ResultsSince the 1st dose there were 380 HCW diagnosed with COVID-19. On visual analysis, the number of cases of COVID-19 in the city increased sharply in 2021. The number of cases among the HCW did not follow. The estimated effectiveness 2 and 3 weeks after 2nd dose was 50.7% and 51.8%, respectively, and increased over the next 2 weeks. 67/142 samples (47%) were variants of concern, mostly P1 (57).

Till the time of this research, there was no effective and universally accepted vaccine to control transmission and spread of this infection. COVID-19 primarily spreads in population through respiratory droplets from an infected person cough and sneeze which infects people who are in proximity. COVID-19 is spreading contagiously across the world. If health policy makers and medical experts could get early and timely insights into when peak infection rate would occur after first reported case, they could plan and optimize medical personnel, ventilators supply, and other medical resources without over-taxing the infrastructure.

In this context, human convalescent plasma has been used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the efficacy remains uncertain.

ObjectiveTo explore potential signals of efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma.

DesignOpen-label, Expanded Access Program (EAP) for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with human convalescent plasma.

SettingMulticenter, including 2,807 acute care facilities in the US and territories.

ParticipantsAdult participants enrolled and transfused under the purview of the US Convalescent Plasma EAP program between April 4 and July 4, 2020 who were hospitalized with (or at risk of) severe or life threatening acute COVID-19 respiratory syndrome.

InterventionTransfusion of at least one unit of human COVID-19 convalescent plasma using standard transfusion guidelines at any time during hospitalization. Convalescent plasma was donated by recently-recovered COVID-19 survivors, and the antibody levels in the units collected were unknown at the time of transfusion.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresSeven and thirty-day mortality.

ResultsThe 35,322 transfused patients had heterogeneous demographic and clinical characteristics. This cohort included a high proportion of critically-ill patients, with 52.3% in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 27.5% receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of plasma transfusion. The seven-day mortality rate was 8.7% [95% CI 8.3%-9.2%] in patients transfused within 3 days of COVID-19 diagnosis but 11.9% [11.4%-12.2%] in patients transfused 4 or more days after diagnosis (p<0.001). Similar findings were observed in 30-day mortality (21.6% vs. 26.7%, p<0.0001). Importantly, a gradient of mortality was seen in relation to IgG antibody levels in the transfused plasma. For patients who received high IgG plasma (>18.45 S/Co), seven-day mortality was 8.9% (6.8%, 11.7%); for recipients of medium IgG plasma (4.62 to 18.45 S/Co) mortality was 11.6% (10.3%, 13.1%); and for recipients of low IgG plasma (<4.62 S/Co) mortality was 13.7% (11.1%, 16.8%) (p=0.048). This unadjusted dose-response relationship with IgG was also observed in thirty-day mortality (p=0.021). The pooled relative risk of mortality among patients transfused with high antibody level plasma units was 0.65 [0.47-0.92] for 7 days and 0.77 [0.63-0.94] for 30 days compared to low antibody level plasma units.

Conclusions and RelevanceThe relationships between reduced mortality and both earlier time to transfusion and higher antibody levels provide signatures of efficacy for convalescent plasma in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This information may be informative for the treatment of COVID-19 and design of randomized clinical trials involving convalescent plasma.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes transfusion of human convalescent plasma reduce mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients?

FindingsTransfusion of convalescent plasma with higher antibody levels to hospitalized COVID-19 patients significantly reduced mortality compared to transfusions with low antibody levels. Transfusions within three days of COVID-19 diagnosis yielded greater reductions in mortality.

MeaningEmbedded in an Expanded Access Program providing access to COVID-19 convalescent plasma and designed to assess its safety, several signals consistent with efficacy of convalescent plasma in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients emerged.","Joyner, M.

23346,COVID-19 vaccine distrust in Colombian university students: Frequency and associated variables,"The study aimed to know the frequency and variables associated with COVID-19 vaccine distrust in students of a Colombian university. A cross-sectional study was carried out which participated emerging adult students of a Colombian university. A total of 1,136 students between 18 and 29 years (M= 22.0, SD = 3.0); most of them were female (66.0%), non-health students (82.8%), low-income (79.0%), and residents of urban areas (84.9%). It was frequent low institutional trust (74.8%), low cognitive, social capital (27.9%), low fear of COVID-19 (49.5%), low perceived stress related to COVID-19 (83.5%), and high COVID-19 vaccine distrust (78.9%). Non-health carrier (Adjusted OR = 3.63, 95%CI 2.58-5.10), rural residence (AOR = 1.85, 95%CI 1.13-3.04), low income (AOR = 1.84, 95%CI 1.31-2.57), and perceived stress related to COVID-19 (AOR = 1.74, 95%CI 1.20-2.54) were related to high COVID-19 vaccine distrust. In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccine distrust is high among emerging adult Colombian university students. The COVID-19 vaccine distrust is related to non-health science carriers, rural residents, low-income, and low-perceived stress related to COVID-19. The COVID-19 related health literacy should be improved in students of this university considering socio-cultural background.","Campo-Arias, A.; Pedrozo-Pupo, J.

11500,Knowledge and Behaviors towards COVID-19 among University of Aleppo Students: An Online Cross-sectional Survey,"BackgroundCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infection caused by a novel coronavirus that affects respiratory tract. Peoples awareness and knowledge of, and behavior and attitude toward COVID-19 are scarcely investigated, making medical literature related to this point poor. we aim to measure the knowledge of, and the reaction to COVID-19 among University of Aleppo students in Syria, and the determinants of their awareness and behavior regarding this disease.

Materials and MethodsThis was an online, questionnaire-based cross-sectional study, that was conducted from 21st March to 30 March 2020. We included undergraduate students of the University of Aleppo (Syria). The questionnaire consisted of three sections: Demographics,knowledge and behaviours. Every participants knowledge was scored from 0-13 depending on the number of correct answers in the knowledge section. The correctness was judged depending on WHO recommendations at the time of questionnaire administration. P-value of 0.05 was considered significant.

ResultsAmong this well-educated and predominantly medical and health-related students, 682 (45.4%) students had a good knowledge level, which is somehow disappointing. The current study shows that 1st year students and non-medical specialties students and smokers had significantly lower knowledge levels than others. On contrary, residing with less people-which may indicate a higher socioeconomic status-, was associated with a higher knowledge level. We also found that commitment to preventive measures was in general satisfying and correlated significantly with knowledge level and gender in most cases.

ConclusionJunior students, non-medical specialties, smokers and those who live with high number of people are vulnerable to less knowledge level and awareness campaigns should concentrate on them. Increasing awareness is useful to increase commitment to preventive measures, and groups that have less adherence to preventive measures, as described in detail, should be taken into consideration while designing public health responses. Finally, we should be aware of the negative impact of quarantine on public health to take it into consideration for current campaigns and future policies.","Alhamid, A. M.; Alhamid, A.

In particular, I study the predicted cases and deaths fitted to data from March and its potential application to data in September. The data is observed to fit the model as predicted until around 150 days after December 31, 2019, after which many countries lift their lockdowns and begin to reopen. A plateau in cases followed by an increase approximately 1.5 months after is also observed. In terms of deaths, the data fits the shape of the model, but the model mostly underestimates the death toll after around 160 days. An analysis of the residuals is provided to locate the precise date of the departure of each country from its accepted data estimates and test each data point to its predicted value using a Z-test to determine whether each observation can fit the given model. The observed behavior is matched to policy measures taken in each country to attach an explanation to these observations. I notice that an international reopening results in a sharp increase in cases, and aim to plot this new growth in cases and predict when the pandemic will end for each country.","Patwardhan, J.",2020-10-06,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.10.03.20206359,1,Jay Patwardhan,John P Stevens High School,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.03.20206359v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.03.20206359v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
15806,An optimal control policy for COVID-19 pandemic until a vaccine deployment,"When an outbreak starts spreading, policy makers have to make decisions that affects health of their citizens and the economic. Some might induce harsh measures, such as lockdown. Following a long harsh lockdown, economical declines force policy makers to rethink reopening. But what is the most effective reopening strategy? In order to provide an effective strategy, here we propose a control strategy model. Our model assesses the trade-off between social performance and limited medical resources by determining individuals propensities. The proposed strategy also helps decision makers to find optimal lockdown and exit strategy for each region. Moreover, the financial loss is minimized. In addition, a study of a COVID-19 dataset for Los Angeles County is performed to validate our model and its results.","Sayarshad, H.

In this study we aimed to predict the time of possible peak and simulate the changes could be happen by the social behavior of Egyptians during Ramadan (the holy month).

MethodsSIR and SEIR compartmental models were used to predict the peak time. We simulated different expected scenarios based to examine their effects on the peak timing.

ResultsWe found that the peak most likely to be in middle of June 2020. Simulating different transmission rate probability and R0 the earliest peak could to be in the May 20 and latest one could be in 18 July. The peak shifted much earlier to 11th April 2020 without lockdown and other mitigation strategies.

ConclusionSocial behaviors of citizens during the holy month will dramatically affect the peak timing.

18744,Which policies most effectively reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools?,"IntroductionNew York City (NYC) has the largest public school system in the United States (US). During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, NYC was the first major US city to open schools for in-person learning in the 2020-2021 academic year. Several policies were implemented to reduce the risk of in-school transmission, including infection control measures (facemasks, physical distancing, enhanced indoor ventilation, cohorting of small groups, and hand hygiene), option of all-remote instruction, alternative options for how class schedules would rotate in-person and remote instruction, daily symptom screening, and testing 10-20% of students and staff weekly or monthly depending on local case rates. We sought to determine which of these policies had the greatest impact on reducing the risk of in-school transmission.

MethodsWe evaluated the impact of each policy by referring to global benchmarks for the secondary attack rate (SAR) of SARS-CoV-2 in school settings and by simulating the potential for transmission in NYCs rotating cohort schedules, in which teachers could act as """"bridges"""" across rotating cohorts. We estimated the impact of (1) infection control measures, (2) providing an option of all-remote instruction, (3) choice of class scheduling for in-person learners, (4) daily symptom screening, (5) testing to curtail transmission, and (6) testing to identify school outbreaks. Each policy was assessed independently of other policies, with the exception of symptom screening and random testing, which were assessed both independently and jointly.

ResultsAmong the policies analyzed, the greatest transmission reduction was associated with the infection control measures, followed by small class cohorts with an option for all-remote instruction, symptom screening, and finally randomly testing 10-20% of school attendees. Assuming adult staff are the primary source of within-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission, weekly testing of staff could be at least as effective as symptom screening, and potentially more so if testing days occur in the beginning of the workweek with results available by the following day. A combination of daily symptom screening and testing on the first workday of each week could reduce transmission by 70%.

ConclusionsAdherence to infection control is the highest priority for safe school re-opening. Further transmission reduction can be achieved through small rotating class cohorts with an option for remote learning, widespread testing at the beginning of the work week, and daily symptom screening and self-isolation. Randomly testing 10-20% of attendees weekly or monthly does not meaningfully curtail transmission and may not detect outbreaks before they have spread beyond a handful of individuals. School systems considering re-opening during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic or similarly virulent respiratory disease outbreaks should consider these relative impacts when setting policy priorities.","Bershteyn, A.; Kim, H.-Y.; Mcgillen, J.

11856,Outcomes of Mechanically Ventilated Patients with COVID-19 Associated Respiratory Failure,"PurposeThe outcomes of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 remain poorly defined. We sought to determine clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 managed with invasive mechanical ventilation in an appropriately resourced US health care system.

MethodsOutcomes of COVID-19 infected patients requiring mechanical ventilation treated within the Inova Health System between March 5, 2020 and April 26, 2020 were evaluated through an electronic medical record review.

Results1023 COVID-19 positive patients were admitted to the Inova Health System during the study period. Of these, 165 (16.1%) were managed with invasive mechanical ventilation. At the time of data censoring, 63/165 patients (38.1%) had died and 102/165 (61.8%) were still alive. Of the surviving 102 patients, 17 (10.3%) remained on mechanical ventilation, 51 (30.9%) were extubated but remained hospitalized, and 34 (20.6%) had been discharged. Deceased patients were older (median age of 66 vs. 55, p <0.0001). 75.7% of patients over 70 years old had died at the time of data analysis. Conversely, % of patients age 70 or younger were still alive at the time of data analysis. Younger age, non-Caucasian race and treatment at a tertiary care center were all associated with survivor status.

ConclusionMortality of patients with COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation is high, with particularly daunting mortality seen in patients of advanced age, even in a well-resourced health care system. A substantial proportion of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were not of advanced age, and this group had a reasonable chance for recovery.","King, C.; Sahjwani, D.; Brown, A.

3724,Separate Fever Clinics Prevent the Spread of COVID-19 and Offload Emergency Resources: Analysis from a large tertiary hospital in China,"ObjectivesCOVID-19 began spreading widely in China in January 2020. Outpatient """"Fever Clinics"""" (FCs), instituted during the SARS epidemic in 2003 were upgraded to provide COVID-19 screening and prevention attached to large tertiary hospitals. We sought to analyze the effect of upgraded FCs to detecting COVID-19 at our institution.

DesignA population-based cross-sectional study.

ParticipantsA total of 6,365 patients were screened in the FC.

MethodsThe FC of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) was upgraded on January 20, 2020. We performed a retrospective study of patients presenting to the FC between December 12, 2019 to February 29, 2020, covering a period of 40 days before and after upgrading the FC. All necessary data, including baseline patient information, diagnoses, follow-up conditions for critical patients, transfer information between the FC and emergency department (ED) were collected and analyzed.

Results6,365 patients were screened in the FC, among whom 2,192 patients were screened before January 21, 2020, while 3,453 were screened afterwards. Screening results showed that upper respiratory infection was the major disease associated with fever. Compared to before the outbreak, patients transferred from the FC to ED decreased significantly [39.21% vs 15.75%, p<0.001] and tended to spend more time in the FC [55 vs 203mins, p<0.001]. For critically-ill patients waiting for a screening result, the total length of stay in the FC was 22mins before the outbreak, compared to 442mins after the outbreak (p< 0.001). The number of in-hospital deaths of critical-care patients seen first in the FC was 9 of 29 patients before the outbreak and 21 of 38 after (p<0.050). Nineteen COVID-19 cases were confirmed in the FC, but no other patients or medical care providers were cross-infected.

ConclusionThe work-load of the FC increased after the COVID-19 outbreak and effectively prevented COVID-19 from spreading in the hospital,as well as offload ED resources.","Wang, J.; Zong, L.; Zhang, J.; Sun, H.; Joseph, W.

4594,Mesenchymal stromal cells for COVID-19: A living systematic review protocol,"ObjectiveTo determine the impact of mesenchymal stromal cells outcomes important to patients with COVID-19.

DesignThis is the protocol of a living systematic review.

Data sourcesWe will conduct searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature and in a centralised repository in L{middle dot}OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L{middle dot}OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L{middle dot}OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methodsWe adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question.

We will include randomised trials evaluating the effect of mesenchymal stromal cells versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomised trials evaluating other coronavirus infections, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19 will be searched in case we find no direct evidence from randomised trials, or if the direct evidence provides low- or very low-certainty for critical outcomes.

Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will pool the results using meta-analysis and will apply the GRADE system to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates.

Ethics and disseminationNo ethics approval is considered necessary. The results of this review will be widely disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, social networks and traditional media.

14266,Bronchoscopy on Intubated COVID-19 Patients is Associated with Low Infectious Risk to Operators at a High-Volume Center Using an Aerosol-minimizing Protocol,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic raised concern for exposure to healthcare providers through aerosol generating procedures, such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Current society guidelines recommended limiting use of BAL to reduce operators risk for infection, yet data on the infection rate for providers after BAL is sparse. Since March 2020, our institution used a modified protocol to perform over 450 BALs on intubated COVID-19 patients. We therefore sought to describe the subsequent infectious risks to providers associated with BAL.

MethodsFifty-two pulmonary and critical care providers (faculty and fellows) at our tertiary-care, urban medical center were surveyed. Survey participants were asked to provide the number of BALs on COVID-19 patients they performed, the number of weeks they cared for intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19, and the results of any SARS-CoV-2 testing that they received. Participants were asked to assess the difficulty of BAL on intubated COVID-19 patients as compared to routine ICU BAL using a numeric perceived difficulty score ranging from 1 (easier) to 10 (harder).

ResultsWe received forty-seven responses from fifty-two surveyed (90% response rate), with 2 declining to participate. Many respondents (19/45, 42%) spent >5 weeks on an ICU service with COVID-19 patients. The number of BALs performed by providers ranged from 0 to >60. Sixteen of the 35 providers (46%) who performed BALs underwent at least one nasopharyngeal (NP) swab to test for SARS-CoV-2, but none were positive. Twenty-seven of the 35 providers (77%) who performed BALs underwent SARS- CoV-2 serology testing, and only one (3.7%) was positive. Respondents indicated occasionally not being able to follow aerosol-minimizing steps but overall felt BALs in COVID-19 patients was only slightly more difficult than routine bronchoscopy.

DiscussionAt a high-volume center having performed >450 BALs on intubated COVID-19 patients with aerosol-limiting precautions, our survey of bronchoscopists found no positive NP SARS-CoV-2 tests and only one positive antibody test result. While the optimal role for COVID-19 BAL remains to be determined, these data suggest that BAL can be safely performed in intubated COVID-19 patients if experienced providers take precautions to limit aerosol generation and wear personal protective equipment.","Gao, C.

4667,A Validation Study for the Successful Isolation Policy in China: a Meta-Analysis in COVID-19,"COVID-19 is quickly spreading around the world and carries along with it a significant threat to public health. This study sought to apply meta-analysis to more precisely and accurately estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the isolation policy across countries, and the corresponding public health capability to care for patients. Prior estimates of R0 have varied widely and range from 1.95 to 6.49. Utilizing meta-analysis techniques we determined a more robust estimation of 3.05 for R0, which is substantially larger than that provided by the WHO. We also present the infectious rate standardized to per million population, which has proved to be a good index to determine whether the isolation measures in specific countries are effective. Also, this standardized infection rate can be used to determine whether the current infectious severity status is out of range of the national health capacity. Finally, we utilize our robust estimate of R0 and the standardized infectious rate to illustrate that the early and aggressive isolation measures enforced by the Chinese government were substantially more effective in controlling the negative impact COVID-19 than the more permissive measures enacted early in Italy and the United States.","Dong, J.; Zhou, Y.; Zhang, Y.; Franz, D.",2020-04-18,Respiratory Medicine,10.1101/2020.04.15.20065102,1,Jianghu Dong,College of Public Health,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.15.20065102v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.15.20065102v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.6339/JDS.202007_18(3).0016
3522,Simple model for Covid-19 epidemics - back-casting in China and forecasting in the US,"Abstract and FindingsIn our previous work, we analyze, in near-real time, evolution of Covid-19 epidemic in China for the first 22 days of reliable data (up to February 6, 2020). In this work, we used the data for the whole 87 days (up to March 13, 2020) in China and the US data available till March 31 (day 70) for systematic evaluation of the logistic model to predict epidemic growth. We sequentially estimated sets of model parameters (maximum number of cases K, growth rate r, and half-time t0) and the epidemic """"end time"""" t95 (defined as the time when the number of cases, predicted or actual, reached 95% of the maximum). The estimates of these parameters were done for sequences of reported cases growing daily (back-casting for China and forecasting for the US). In both countries, the estimates of K grew very much in time during the exponential and nearly exponential phases making longer term forecasting not reliable. For the US, the current estimate of the maximum number of cases K is about 265,000 but it is very likely that it will grow in the future.

15340,COPD in the time of COVID-19: An analysis of acute exacerbations and reported behavioural changes in patients with COPD,"IntroductionThe impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and lockdown measures, on acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the change in AECOPD treatment frequency during the first six weeks of lockdown in the UK compared with 2019 and assess changes in self-reported behaviour and well-being.

MethodsIn this observational study patients with established COPD were recruited. Exacerbation frequency was measured in the first six weeks of COVID lockdown and compared with the same period in 2019 using electronic health records. A telephone survey was used to assess changes in anxiety, inhaler adherence, physical activity, shopping and visitor behaviour during the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods compared to normal.

Results160 participants were recruited (mean [SD] age 67.3 [8.1] years, 88 [55%] male, FEV1 34.3 [13] % predicted) and 140 [88%] reported at least one AECOPD in the previous year. Significantly more community treated exacerbations were observed in 2020 compared with 2019 (126 vs 99, p=0.026). The increase was as a result of multiple courses of treatment, with a similar proportion of patients receiving at least one course (34.4% vs 33.8%).

During """"lockdown"""" participants reported significantly increased anxiety, adherence to their preventative inhalers, and good adherence to shielding advice (all p<0.001). A significant reduction in self-reported physical activity and visitors was reported (both p<0.001).

DiscussionTreatment for AECOPD events increased during the first six weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the UK compared to 2019. This was associated with increased symptoms of anxiety and significant behavioural change.

What is the key question?How has the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown affected exacerbation patterns and behaviour in patients with COPD?

What is the bottom line?A 38% increase in the number of community treated exacerbations was seen in 2020 compared with 2019. Increased symptoms of anxiety were seen in patients, alongside increased inhaler adherence and reduced physical activity.

Why read on?The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant changes in treatment for exacerbations of COPD in the community, as well as increased anxiety amongst patients.","Mcauley, H. J.

10622,"Efficacy and Safety of Remdesivir for COVID-19 Treatment: An Analysis of Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials","BACKGROUNDRemdesivir, an inhibitor of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, has been identified as a candidate for COVID-19 treatment. However, the therapeutic effect of remdesivir is controversial.

METHODSWe searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from inception to June 11, 2020 for randomized controlled trials on the clinical efficacy of remdesivir. The main outcomes were discharge rate, mortality, and adverse events. This study is registered at INPLASY (INPLASY202060046).

RESULTSData of 1075 subjects showed that remdesivir significantly increased the discharge rate of patients with COVID-19 compared with the placebo (50.4% vs. 45.29%; relative risk [RR] 1.19 [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.34], I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.754). It also significantly decreased mortality (8.18% vs. 12.70%; RR 0.64 [95% CI, 0.44-0.92], I2 = 45.7%, P = 0.175) compared to the placebo. Data of 1296 subjects showed that remdesivir significantly decreased the occurrence of serious adverse events (RR 0.77 [95% CI, 0.63-0.94], I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.716).

CONCLUSIONRemdesivir is efficacious and safe for the treatment of COVID-19.

3889,Interaction between malarial transmission and BCG vaccination with COVID-19 incidence in the world map: A changing landscape human immune system?,"BackgroundCOVID-19 (Corona virus Disease-2019) is a new public health emergency and is a pandemic currently. Incidence and mortality of COVID-19 vary in different geographical areas. In this study we aimed to analyse the relationship between malaria transmission and BCG vaccination with COVID-19 incidence in the world map.

Materials and methodsWe collected malaria cases data (World Health Organisation (WHO), 2018), worldwide COVID-19 cases and mortality data (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) and data on BCG vaccination. COVID-19 incidence and mortality was compared.

FindingsData on 5316978938 persons from 166 countries were analysed. Malaria incidence rate was negatively correlated with COVID-19 incidence rate (correlation coefficient = -0.513, p<0.001). Malaria free countries had significantly higher number of COVID-19 cases compared to malaria endemic countries. In Europe and Americas, countries, which have higher BCG vaccination coverage, had significantly less mortality per thousand population compared to those with low BCG coverage (median 0.0002 (0-0.0005) vs 0.0029 (0.0002-0.0177), p=0.017). The case fatality ratio of COVID-19 was related nonlinearly to the malaria incidence.

ConclusionsThe results suggest the changing human immune system as we progress to eliminate parasitic diseases with time. Chloroquine exposure in malaria endemic zones might have a protective effect.

Summary boxO_ST_ABS""""What is already known on this subject?""""C_ST_ABSTo the best of the authors no similar evidence, of the effect of malarial transmission on the COVID-19 global distribution is known. The effect of the Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine on modifying the human immune system has been reported before and is postulated to protective against certain viral infections like Influenza A (H1N1) and herpes virus.

""""What this study adds?""""This study finds that COVID-19 incidence, worldwide is less in countries, which are malaria-endemic. In the European and American countries, increased BCG coverage may have some mortality advantage against COVID-19. The case fatality rate was related to malaria incidence, however, in a complex way. This could be a window into the changing landscape of human immune system as we progress to eliminate parasitic disease with time or this could be due to long-term protective body level of anti-malarials like chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in countries with higher malaria incidence rate.","Goswami, R.

9495,Retarded logistic equation as a universal dynamic model for the spread of COVID-19,"In this work we propose the retarded logistic equation as a dynamic model for the spread of COVID-19 all over the world. This equation accounts for asymptomatic transmission, pre-symptomatic or latent transmission as well as contact tracing and isolation, and leads to a transparent definition of the instantaneous reproduction number R. For different parameter values, the model equation admits different classes of solutions. These solution classes correspond to, inter alia, containment of the outbreak via public health measures, exponential growth despite public health measures, containment despite reopening and second wave following reopening. We believe that the spread of COVID in every localized area such as a city, district or county can be accounted for by one of our solution classes. In regions where R > 1 initially despite aggressive epidemic management efforts, we find that if the mitigation measures are sustained, then it is still possible for R to dip below unity when far less than the regions entire population is affected, and from that point onwards the outbreak can be driven to extinction in time. We call this phenomenon partial herd immunity. Our analysis indicates that COVID-19 is an extremely vicious and unpredictable disease which poses unique challenges for public health authorities, on account of which """"case races"""" among various countries and states do not serve any purpose and present delusive appearances while ignoring significant determinants.","Shayak, B.; Sharma, M.

17546,Analytical and Clinical Performance of the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen-Detecting Rapid Diagnostic Test,"BackgroundThe current standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, RT-qPCR, has important drawbacks for its use as a tool for epidemiological control, including the need of laboratory-processing, high cost, and long turnaround from sampling to results release. Antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) provide a promising alternative for this purpose.

MethodsWe assessed the analytical and clinical performance of the Ag-RDT Panbio COVID-19 Ag Test (Abbott), using RT-qPCR as a reference test. The clinical performance was assessed using nasopharyngeal swabs, collected in routine practice for case confirmation and contact tracing, and nasal mid-turbinate swabs, collected in preventive screenings of asymptomatic individuals. Fresh samples were analysed by RT-q-PCR, stored at -80 {degrees}C, and analysed using the Ag-RDT according to the manufacturer instructions.

FindingsThe Ag-RDT had a limit of detection of 6{middle dot}5x105 copies/reaction. The clinical performance was assessed on 1,406 frozen swabs with a PCR result available: 951 (67{middle dot}7%) positive and 455 (32{middle dot}4%) negative. The Ag-RDT identified the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in 872 of 951 PCR-positive samples (91{middle dot}7%; 95% CI 89{middle dot}8-93{middle dot}4 and ruled out its presence in 450 of 455 PCR-negative samples (specificity 98{middle dot}9%; 95% CI 97{middle dot}5- 99{middle dot}6). Sensitivity increased in samples with lower Ct values (Ct <25, 98{middle dot}2%; Ct<30, 94{middle dot}9%) and was higher among symptomatic cases (92{middle dot}6%) and their contacts (94{middle dot}2%) than among asymptomatic individuals (79{middle dot}5%). In the setting of asymptomatic screening, sensitivity also increased with lower Ct values (Ct <25, 100%; Ct<30, 98{middle dot}6%). Assuming a pre-test probability of 5%, the negative and positive predictive values were 99{middle dot}6% (99{middle dot}5 - 99{middle dot}6) and 81{middle dot}5% (65{middle dot}0 - 93{middle dot}2), respectively.

InterpretationThe Panbio COVID-19 Ag-RDT has high sensitivity for detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs of both, symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The diagnostic performance of the test is particularly good in samples with viral loads associated with high risk of viral transmission (Ct <25), which show high positive and negative predictive values even when assuming a prevalence as low as 5%.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSOn October 6, 2020, we searched PubMed for articles containing """"Antigen"""", """"test"""", """"SARS-CoV-2"""", """"COVID-19"""" and """"performance"""" in either the title or the abstract. We found five studies that showed the accuracy of point-of-care tests in identifying SARS-CoV-2 antigens for confirmation of clinically suspected COVID-19. We found high variability in the diagnostic accuracy of Ag-RDT. Most tests showed high specificity (i.e., 99% or higher), whereas sensitivity ranged from 11% to 92%; only one test reported sensitivity higher than 60%. We found no studies investigating the diagnostic accuracy of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Test. We found no studies that assessed the performance of Ag-RDT for population-level screening of asymptomatic individuals.

Added value of this studyOur analysis provides information regarding the diagnostic accuracy of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Test when tested on 1,406 frozen samples of nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs collected in routine practice for diagnostic confirmation of symptomatic individuals with suspected COVID-19 or contacts exposed to a positive case, and preventive screenings of unexposed asymptomatic individuals. Compared with RT-qPCR as reference test, the Ag-RDT showed a sensitivity and specificity of 91{middle dot}7% and 98{middle dot}9%. Test sensitivity increased in samples with viral load associated with high risk of transmission (Ct <25), reaching more than 98%, regardless of the presence of symptoms.

Implications of all the available evidenceAvailable evidence show variability in the diagnostic performance of marketed Ag-RDT. Our results provide substantial evidence that the point-of-care Panbio COVID-19 Ag Test can accurately identify SARS-CoV-2 antigens in people with suspected clinical COVID-19 as well as in asymptomatic people with high viral load and therefore, associated with higher risk of transmission. This finding represents a potentially useful advance for mass screening of asymptomatic people at the point-of-care.","Mitja, O.",2020-11-03,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.30.20223198,1,Oriol Mitja,Fundacio Lluita contra la Sida,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.20223198v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.20223198v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.12.033
8424,Lopinavir-Ritonavir in treatment of COVID-19: A dynamic systematic benefit-risk assessment,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is an ongoing, global public health crisis for which safe and effective treatments need to be identified. The benefit-risk balance for use of lopinavir-ritonavir in COVID-19 needs to be monitored on an ongoing basis, therefore a systematic benefit-risk assessment was designed and conducted. A key objective of this study was to provide a platform for a dynamic systematic benefit-risk evaluation; although initially this evaluation is likely to contain limited information, it is required due to the urgent unmet public need. Importantly it allows additional data to be incorporated as it becomes available, and re-evaluation of the benefit-risk profile.

MethodsA systematic benefit-risk assessment was conducted using the Benefit-Risk Action team (BRAT) framework. The exposure of interest was lopinavir-ritonavir treatment in COVID-19 compared to standard of care, placebo or other treatments. A literature search was conducted in PubMed and EmBase to identify peer-reviewed papers reporting clinical outcomes. Two clinicians constructed a value tree and ranked key benefits and risks in order of considered clinical importance.

ResultsIn comparison to standard of care, data for several key benefits and risks were identified for lopinavir-ritonavir. Time to clinical improvement was not significantly different for lopinavir-ritonavir in comparison to standard of care (HR=1.31, 95% CI:0.95, 1.80). There appeared to be fewer serious adverse events with lopinavir-ritonavir (20%) vs standard of care (32%). In particular, there were fewer cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome with lopinavir-ritonavir compared to standard of care (13% vs 27%). Limited data were available for comparison of lopinavir-ritonavir to other treatments.

ConclusionsBased on currently available data, there was no clear benefit for use of lopinavir-ritonavir compared to standard of care in severe COVID-19. Risk data suggested a possible decrease in serious adverse events, including acute respiratory distress syndrome. Overall, the benefit-risk profile for lopinavir-ritonavir in severe COVID-19 cannot be considered positive until further efficacy and effectiveness data become available.","Osborne, V.; Davies, M.; Lane, S.; Evans, A.; Denyer, J.; Dhanda, S.; Roy, D.; Shakir, S.

3090,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"In the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, currently vaccines and specific anti-viral treatment are not yet available. Thus, preventing viral transmission by case isolation, quarantine, and social distancing is essential to slowing its spread. Here we model social networks using weighted graphs, where vertices represent individuals and edges represent contact. As public health measures are implemented, connectivity in the graph decreases, resulting in lower effective reproductive numbers, and reduced viral transmission. For COVID-19, model parameters were derived from the coronavirus epidemic in China, validated by epidemic data in Italy, then applied to the United States. We calculate that, in the U.S., the public is able to contain viral transmission by limiting the average number of contacts per person to less than 7 unique individuals over each 5 day period. This increases the average social distance between individuals to 10 degrees of separation.","Zhao, P.

20202,Mechanical ventilation affects respiratory microbiome of COVID-19 patients and its interactions with the host,"Understanding the pathology of COVID-19 is a global research priority. Early evidence suggests that the microbiome may be playing a role in disease progression, yet current studies report contradictory results. Here, we examine potential confounders in COVID-19 microbiome studies by analyzing the upper (n=58) and lower (n=35) respiratory tract microbiome in well-phenotyped COVID-19 patients and controls combining microbiome sequencing, viral load determination, and immunoprofiling. We found that time in the intensive care unit and the type of oxygen support explained the most variation within the upper respiratory tract microbiome, dwarfing (non-significant) effects from viral load, disease severity, and immune status. Specifically, mechanical ventilation was linked to altered community structure, lower species- and higher strain-level diversity, and significant shifts in oral taxa previously associated with COVID-19. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the lower respiratory tract of ventilated COVID-19 patients identified increased oral microbiota compared to controls. These oral microbiota were found physically associated with proinflammatory immune cells, which showed higher levels of inflammatory markers. Overall, our findings suggest confounders are driving contradictory results in current COVID-19 microbiome studies and careful attention needs to be paid to ICU stay and type of oxygen support, as bacteria favored in these conditions may contribute to the inflammatory phenotypes observed in severe COVID-19 patients.","Llorens-Rico, V.; Gregory, A.

3685,Inflow restrictions can prevent epidemics when contact tracing efforts are effective but have limited capacity,"When a region tries to prevent an outbreak of an epidemic, like that of COVID-19, two broad strategies are initially available: limiting the inflow of infected cases using travel restrictions and quarantines, and reducing the transmissions from inflowing cases using contact tracing and community interventions. A large number of papers have used epidemiological models to argue that inflow restrictions are unlikely to be effective. We conduct a mathematical analysis using a simple epidemiological model and perform simulations which show how this conclusion changes if we relax the assumption of unlimited capacity in containment efforts such as contact tracing. In particular, when contact tracing is effective, but the system is close to being overwhelmed, moderate travel restrictions can have a very large effect on the probability of an epidemic.","Malmberg, H.; Britton, T.",2020-04-06,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.01.20050401,1,Hannes Malmberg,"University of Minnesota, Department of Economics",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050401v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050401v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1098/rsif.2020.0351
9464,Oscillations in USA COVID-19 Incidence and Mortality Data reflect societal factors,"The COVID-19 pandemic currently in process differs from other infectious disease calamities that have previously plagued humanity in the vast amount of information that is produces each day, which includes daily estimates of the disease incidence and mortality data. Apart from providing actionable information to public health authorities on the trend of the pandemic, the daily incidence reflects the process of disease in a susceptible population and thus reflects the pathogenesis of COVID-19, the public health response and diagnosis and reporting. Both daily new cases and daily mortality data in the US exhibit periodic oscillatory patterns. By analyzing NYC and LA testing data, we demonstrate that this oscillation in the number of cases can be strongly explained by the daily variation in testing. This seems to rule out alternative hypotheses such as increased infections on certain days of the week as driving this oscillation. Similarly, we show that the apparent oscillation in mortality in the US data is mostly an artifact of reporting, which disappears in datasets that record death by episode date, such as the NYC and LA datasets. Periodic oscillations in COVID-19 incidence and mortality data reflect testing and reporting practices and contingencies. Thus, these contingencies should be considered first prior to suggesting social or biological mechanisms.","Bergman, A.; Sella, Y.; Agre, P.; Casadevall, A.",2020-06-12,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.08.20123786,1,Arturo Casadevall,Johns Hopkins School of Public Health,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.08.20123786v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.08.20123786v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1128/msystems.00544-20

4684,Meteorological factors and domestic new cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in nine Asian cities: A time-series analysis,"AIMTo investigate the associations of meteorological factors and the daily new cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in nine Asian cities.

METHODPearsons correlation and generalized additive modeling were performed to assess the relationships between daily new COVID-19 cases and meteorological factors (daily average temperature and relative humidity) with the most updated data currently available.

RESULTSThe Pearson correlation showed that daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 were more correlated with the average temperature than with relative humidity. Daily new confirmed cases were negatively correlated with the average temperature in Beijing (r=-0.565, P<0.01), Shanghai (r=-0.471, P<0.01), and Guangzhou (r=-0.530, P<0.01), yet in contrast, positively correlated with that in Japan (r=0.441, P<0.01). In most of the cities (Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo, and Kuala Lumpur), generalized additive modeling analysis showed the number of daily new confirmed cases was positively associated with both average temperature and relative humidity, especially in lagged 3d model, where a positive influence of temperature on the daily new confirmed cases was discerned in 5 cities except in Beijing, Wuhan, Korea, and Malaysia. Nevertheless, the results were inconsistent across cities and lagged time, suggesting meteorological factors were unlikely to greatly influence the COVID-19 epidemic.

CONCLUSIONThe associations between meteorological factors and the number of COVID-19 daily cases are inconsistent across cities and lagged time. Large-scale public health measures and expanded regional research are still required until a vaccine becomes available and herd immunity is established.

Significance statementWith increasing COVID-19 cases across China and the world, and previous studies showing that meteorological factors may be associated with infectious disease transmission, the saying has it that when summer comes, the epidemic of COVID-19 may simultaneously fade away. We demonstrated the influence of meteorological factors on the daily domestic new cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in nine Asian cities. And we found that the associations between meteorological factors and the number of COVID-19 daily cases are inconsistent across cities and time. We think this important topic may give better clues on prevention, management, and preparation for new events or new changes that could happen in the COVID-19 epidemiology in various geographical regions and as we move towards Summer.","He, Z.; Chin, Y.; Huang, J.; He, Y.; Akinwunmi, B.

3855,State-specific Projection of COVID-19 Infection in the United States and Evaluation of Three Major Control Measures,"Most models of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States do not consider geographic variation and spatial interaction. In this research, we developed a travel-network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) mathematical compartmental model system that characterizes infections by state and incorporates inflows and outflows of interstate travelers. Modeling reveals that curbing interstate travel when the disease is already widespread will make little difference. Meanwhile, increased testing capacity (facilitating early identification of infected people and quick isolation) and strict social-distancing and self-quarantine rules are most effective in abating the outbreak. The modeling has also produced state-specific information. For example, for New York and Michigan, isolation of persons exposed to the virus needs to be imposed within 2 days to prevent a broad outbreak, whereas for other states this period can be 3.6 days. This model could be used to determine resources needed before safely lifting state policies on social distancing.","Chen, S.; Li, Q.; Gao, S.; Kang, Y.; Shi, X.",2020-10-25,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.03.20052720,2,Qin Li,University of Wisconsin-Madisons,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052720v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052720v2.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
25034,Evaluating the impact of keeping indoor dining closed on COVID-19 rates among large US cities: a quasi-experimental design,"ObjectiveIndoor dining is one of the potential key drivers of COVID-19 transmission. We leverage the heterogeneity in state government preemption of city indoor dining closures, to estimate the impact of keeping indoor dining closed on COVID-19 incidence.

MethodsWe obtained case rates and city/state re-opening dates from March to October 2020 in 11 U.S. cities. We categorized cities as (treatment) cities that were allowed by the state to reopen but kept indoor dining closed; and (comparison) cities that would have kept indoor dining closed but were preempted by their state and had to reopen indoor dining.

ResultsKeeping indoor dining closed was associated with a 43% (IRR=0.57, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.69) decline in COVID-19 incidence over 4-weeks compared with cities that reopened indoor dining. These results were consistent after testing alternative modeling strategies.

ConclusionsKeeping indoor dining closed contributes to reductions in COVID-19 spread.

Policy ImplicationsEvidence of the relationship between indoor dining and COVID-19 incidence can inform state and local decisions to restrict indoor dining as a tailored strategy to reduce COVID-19 incidence.","Schnake-Mahl, A.

24284,Characterizing the incidence of adverse events of special interest for COVID-19 vaccines across eight countries: a multinational network cohort study,"BackgroundAs large-scale immunization programs against COVID-19 proceed around the world, safety signals will emerge that need rapid evaluation. We report population-based, age- and sex- specific background incidence rates of potential adverse events of special interest (AESI) in eight countries using thirteen databases.

MethodsThis multi-national network cohort study included eight electronic medical record and five administrative claims databases from Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, mapped to a common data model. People observed for at least 365 days before 1 January 2017, 2018, or 2019 were included. We based study outcomes on lists published by regulators: acute myocardial infarction, anaphylaxis, appendicitis, Bells palsy, deep vein thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic stroke, immune thrombocytopenia, myocarditis/pericarditis, narcolepsy, pulmonary embolism, and transverse myelitis. We calculated incidence rates stratified by age, sex, and database. We pooled rates across databases using random effects meta-analyses. We classified meta-analytic estimates into Council of International Organizations of Medical Sciences categories: very common, common, uncommon, rare, or very rare.

FindingsWe analysed 126,661,070 people. Rates varied greatly between databases and by age and sex. Some AESI (e.g., myocardial infarction, Guillain-Barre syndrome) increased with age, while others (e.g., anaphylaxis, appendicitis) were more common in young people. As a result, AESI were classified differently according to age. For example, myocardial infarction was very rare in children, rare in women aged 35-54 years, uncommon in men and women aged 55-84 years, and common in those aged [&ge;]85 years.

InterpretationWe report robust baseline rates of prioritised AESI across 13 databases. Age, sex, and variation between databases should be considered if background AESI rates are compared to event rates observed with COVID-19 vaccines.","Li, X.; Ostropolets, A.; Makadia, R.; Shoaibi, A.; Rao, G.; Sena, A.

23204,Estimation and optimal control of the multi-scale dynamics of the Covid-19,"This work aims at a better understanding and the optimal control of the spread of the new severe acute respiratory corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We first propose a multi-scale model giving insights on the virus population dynamics, the transmission process and the infection mechanism. We consider 10 compartments in the human population in order to take into accounts the effects of different specific mitigation policies: susceptible, infected, infectious, quarantined, hospitalized, treated, recovered, non-infectious dead, infectious dead, buried. The population of viruses is also partitioned into 10 compartments corresponding respectively to each of the first nine human population compartments and the free viruses available in the environment. Indeed, we have human to human virus transmission, human to environment virus transmission, environment to human virus transmission and self infection by susceptible individuals. We show the global stability of the disease free equilibrium if a given threshold[T] 0 is less or equal to 1 and we provide how to compute the basic reproduction number[R] 0. A convergence index[T] 1 is also defined in order to estimate the speed at which the disease extincts and an upper bound to the time of extinction is given. The existence of the endemic equilibrium is conditional and its description is provided. We evaluate the sensitivity of[R] 0,[T] 0 and[T] 1 to control parameters such as the maximal human density allowed per unit of surface, the rate of disinfection both for people and environment, the mobility probability, the wearing mask probability or efficiency, and the human to human contact rate which results from the previous one. Except the maximal human density allowed per unit of surface, all those parameters have significant effects on the qualitative dynamics of the disease. The most significant is the probability of wearing mask followed by the probability of mobility and the disinfection rate. According to a functional cost taking into consideration economic impacts of SARS-CoV-2, we determine and discuss optimal fighting strategies. The study is applied to real available data from Cameroon and an estimation of model parameters is done. After several simulations, social distancing and the disinfection frequency appear as the main elements of the optimal control strategy.","Fotsa Mbogne, D. J.; Tchoumi, S.

5814,Geographical identification of the vulnerable groups during COVID-19 crisis: the typhoon eye effect and its boundary conditions,"AimAlthough some studies suggest the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with negative consequences on physical health, our knowledge about the detrimental effects of COVID-19 on peoples mental health is still nascent. This study uses typhoon eye theory to offer insights in helping clinical psychiatrists to screen people with well-being issues during COVID-19 outbreak.

MethodsWe collected survey data from working adults across different geographical areas in China on 20 and 21 February 2020 during the outbreak of COVID-19. The sample contains 308 working adults, who were in various parts of China, with varying distance to the epicenter of Wuhan.

ResultsIndividual adults distance to the epicenter was negatively associated with life satisfaction ({beta} = -0.235, 95% CI -0.450 to -0.020, p = 0.032). This association between distance and life satisfaction was significant only for adults who were young or had smaller family sizes. For example, the negative relationship was strongest when the individuals were in the age bracket of 20 years old (15.7%; {beta} = -0.703, 95% CI -1.098 to -0.307; p = 0.001) and single (32.3%; {beta} = -0.767, 95% CI -1.125 to -0.408; p < 0.001).

ConclusionOur results that peoples well-being deteriorates by the distance from the epicenter for specific groups of people help guide mental healthcare providers towards the regions that are further away from the epicenter in the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Meanwhile, our results indicate the practitioners should be cautious of using typhoon eye effect for individuals who were older or had a larger family size.","Tang, P. M.; Zhang, S. X.; Li, C.

22529,Mortality after surgery with SARS-CoV-2 infection in England: A population-wide epidemiological study,"ObjectivesTo confirm the incidence of perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated mortality after surgery.

Design and settingAnalysis of routine electronic health record data from National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England.

MethodsWe extracted data from Hospital Episode Statistics in England describing adult patients undergoing surgery between 1st January 2020 and 31st October 2020. The exposure was SARS-CoV-2 infection defined by ICD-10 codes. The primary outcome measure was 90-day in-hospital mortality. Data were analysed using multivariable logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, Charlson co-morbidity index, index of multiple deprivation, presence of cancer, surgical procedure type and admission acuity. Results are presented as n (%) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.

ResultsWe identified 1,972,153 patients undergoing surgery of whom 11,940 (0.6%) had SARS-CoV-2. In total, 19,100 (1.0%) patients died in hospital. SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a much greater risk of death (SARS-CoV-2: 2,618/11,940 [21.9%] vs No SARS-CoV-2: 16,482/1,960,213 [0.8%]; OR: 5.8 [5.5 - 6.1]; p<0.001). Amongst patients undergoing elective surgery 1,030/1,374,985 (0.1%) had SARS-CoV-2 of whom 83/1,030 (8.1%) died, compared with 1,092/1,373,955 (0.1%) patients without SARS-CoV-2 (OR: 29.0 [22.5 -37.3]; p<0.001). Amongst patients undergoing emergency surgery 9,742/437,891 (2.2%) patients had SARS-CoV-2, of whom 2,466/9,742 (25.3%) died compared with 14,817/428,149 (3.5%) patients without SARS-CoV-2 (OR: 5.7 [5.4 - 6.0]; p<0.001).

ConclusionsThe low incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHS surgical pathways suggests current infection prevention and control policies are highly effective. However, the high mortality amongst patients with SARS-CoV-2 suggests these precautions cannot be safely relaxed.

20815,"Magnitude, change over time, demographic characteristics and geographic distribution of excess deaths among nursing home residents during the first wave of COVID-19 in France: a nationwide cohort study","ImportanceNursing home (NH) residents are particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infections and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lethality. However, excess deaths in this population have rarely been documented.

ObjectivesThe primary objective was to assess the number of excess deaths among NH residents during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in France. The secondary objectives were to determine the number of excess deaths as a proportion of the total excess deaths in the general population and determine whether a harvesting effect was present.

DesignWe studied a cohort of 494,753 adults (as of March 1st, 2020) aged 60 and over in 6,515 NHs in mainland France. This cohort was exposed to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (from March 1st to May 31st, 2020) and was compared with the corresponding, reference cohorts from 2014 to 2019 (using data from the French National Health Data System).

Main outcome and measuresThe main outcome was all-cause death. Weekly excess deaths and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were estimated.

ResultThere were 13,505 excess deaths among NH residents. Mortality increased by 43% (SMR: 1.43). The mortality excess was higher among males than among females (SMR: 1.51 and 1.38, respectively) and decreased with age (SMRs in females: 1.61 in the 60-74 age group, 1.58 for 75-84, 1.41 for 85-94, and 1.31 for 95 or over; Males: SMRs: 1.59 for 60-74, 1.69 for 75-84, 1.47 for 85-94, and 1.41 for 95 or over). We did not observe a harvesting effect (up until August 30th, 2020). By extrapolating to all NH residents nationally (N=570,003), the latter accounted for 51% of the total excess deaths in the general population (N=15,114 out of 29,563).

ConclusionNH residents accounted for about half of the total excess deaths in France during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The excess death rate was higher among males than females and among younger residents than among older residents. We did not observe a harvesting effect. A real-time mortality surveillance system and the identification of individual and environmental risk factors might help to design the future model of care for older dependent adults.

5808,Performance verification of detecting COVID-19 specific antibody by using four chemiluminescence immunoassay systems,"BackgroundThe purpose of current study is to evaluate the analytical performance of seven kits for detecting IgM/IgG antibody of corona virus (2019-nCoV) by using four chemiluminescence immunoassay systems.

Methods50 patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection and 130 controls without corona virus infection from the General Hospital of Chongqing were enrolled in current retrospective study. Four chemiluminescence immunoassay systems including seven IgM/IgG antibody detection Kits for 2019-nCoV (A_IgM, A_IgG, B_IgM, B_IgG, C_IgM, C_IgG, D_Ab) were employed to detecting antibody concentration. Chi-square test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Youdens index were demonstrated to verify the cutoff value of each detection system.

ResultsThe repeatability verification results of the A, B, C, and D system are all qualified. D-Ab performances best (92% sensitivity and 99.23% specificity), and B_IgM worse than other systems. Except for the system of A_IgM and C_IgG, the optimal diagnostic thresholds and cutoff value of other kits from recommendations are inconsistent with each other. B_IgM got the worst AUC and C_IgG had the best diagnostic accuracy. More importantly, B_IgG system have the highest false positive rate for testing patients with AIDS, tumor and pregnant. A_IgM system test showed highest false positive rates among elder over 90 years old.

7717,"The COVID-19 Pandemic Predominantly Hits Poor Neighborhoods, or does it? Evidence from Germany","BackgroundReports from the UK and the USA suggest that COVID-19 predominantly affects poorer individuals and neighbourhoods. This article paints a more complex picture by distinguishing between a first and second phase of the pandemic. The initial spread of infections and its correlation with socioeconomic factors largely depends on how the virus first entered a country. The second phase of the pandemic begins when individuals start taking precautionary measures and governments implement lockdowns. In this phase the further spread of the virus depends on the ability of individuals to socially distance themselves, which is to some extent socially stratified.

MethodsWe analyze the geographical distribution of known cases per capita across 401 local districts in Germany, once for infections in the initial phase and for new infections during the second phase.

ResultsIn Germany, the virus first entered via individuals returning from skiing in the Alps and other international travel. In this first phase we find a positive association between the wealth of a district and infection rates and a negative association with indicators of social deprivation. During the second phase, richer districts and districts with a higher share of university-educated employees record fewer new infections, whilst the initial safety advantage of more socially deprived districts disappears.

ConclusionThe social stratification of Covid-19 changes substantively across the two phases of the pandemic in Germany. Only in the second phase does socio-economic advantage turn into a safety advantage. Thus, suggestions that the pandemic predominantly hits the poor needs to be qualified.","Pluemper, T.; Neumayer, E.",2020-05-22,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.05.18.20105395,1,Thomas Pluemper,Vienna University of Economics and Business,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.18.20105395v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.18.20105395v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
1731,"Distribution of the 2019-nCoV Epidemic and Correlation with Population Emigration from Wuhan, China","BACKGROUNDSThe ongoing new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia outbreak is spreading in China and has not reached its peak. Five millions of people had emigrated from Wuhan before the city lockdown, which potentially represent a source of virus spreaders. Case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in early epidemic are of great importance for early warning and prevention of future outbreak.

METHODSThe officially reported cases of 2019-nCoV pneumonia were collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location information of these cases were extracted analyzed with ArcGIS and WinBUGS. Population migration data of Wuhan City and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi and analyzed for their correlation with case number.

FINDINGSThe 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases were predominantly distributed in Hubei and other provinces of South China. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan provinces that are adjacent to Hubei. While Wuhan city has the highest number of cases, the time risk is relatively stable. Numbers of cases in some cities are relatively low, but the time risks are continuously rising. The case numbers of different provinces and cities of Hubei province were highly correlated with the emigrated populations from Wuhan. Lockdown of 19 cities of Hubei province, and implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented the exponential growth of case number.

INTERPRETATIONPopulation emigrated from Wuhan was the main infection source for other cities and provinces. Some cities with low case number but were in rapid increase. Due to the upcoming Spring Festival return transport wave, understanding of the trends of risks in different regions is of great significance for preparedness for both individuals and institutions.

21457,COVID-19-related disruptions to routine vaccination services in India: perspectives from pediatricians,"Background and ObjectiveThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruptions to routine immunization programs in India and around the world, setting the stage for potentially serious outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.

MethodsWe surveyed pediatric healthcare providers in India in 2 rounds in April-June and September 2020 to understand how COVID-19 control measures may have impacted routine vaccination.

ResultsRespondents were predominantly pediatricians working in primary, secondary or tertiary healthcare centers, across 21 Indian states and two union territories. Among the 424 (survey 1) and 141 (survey 2) respondents, 33.4% and 7.8%, respectively, reported near complete suspension of vaccination services due to COVID-19. A 50% or greater drop in vaccination services was reported by 83.1% of respondents in June, followed by 32.6% four months later, indicating slow recovery of services. By September 2020, 83.6% were aware of updated guidelines on safe provision of immunization services, although awareness of specific catch-up vaccination plans was low, and 76.6% expressed concern about a vaccine coverage gap that could potentially lead to increased non-COVID-19 illnesses and deaths.

ConclusionsPandemic-related disruptions to vaccination services were reported by pediatricians across India. Concerted efforts are needed from governing and academic groups to ensure that routine immunization and catch-up programs are implemented during this pandemic, which can sustain gains in vaccination coverage and provide a robust blueprint for the national roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine.","Shet, A.; Dhaliwal, B.; Banerjee, P.; Carr, K.; Deluca, A.; Britto, C.; Seth, R.; Parekh, B.; Basavaraj, G.; Shastri, D.; Gupta, P.",2021-01-27,Pediatrics,10.1101/2021.01.25.21250040,1,Anita Shet,Johns Hopkins School of Public Health,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.25.21250040v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.25.21250040v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
4428,Detection of neutralising antibodies to SARS coronavirus 2 to determine population exposure in Scottish blood donors between March and May 2020,"BackgroundThe progression and geographical distribution of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the UK and elsewhere is unknown because typically only symptomatic individuals are diagnosed. We performed a serological study of blood donors in Scotland between the 17th of March and the 18th of May to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as a marker of past infection and epidemic progression.

AimTo determine if sera from blood bank donors can be used to track the emergence and progression of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.

MethodsA pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay was used to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The study group comprised samples from 3,500 blood donors collected in Scotland between the 17th of March and 19th of May, 2020. Controls were collected from 100 donors in Scotland during 2019.

ResultsAll samples collected on the 17th March, 2020 (n=500) were negative in the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 6/500 donors from the 23th-26th of March. The number of samples containing neutralising antibodies did not significantly rise after the 5th-6th April until the end of the study on the 18th of May. We find that infections are concentrated in certain postcodes indicating that outbreaks of infection are extremely localised. In contrast, other areas remain comparatively untouched by the epidemic.

ConclusionThese data indicate that sero-surveys of blood banks can serve as a useful tool for tracking the emergence and progression of an epidemic like the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.","Thompson, C.

3752,Efficient and Practical Sample Pooling for High-Throughput PCR Diagnosis of COVID-19,"In the global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, governments and public health agencies are striving to rapidly increase the volume and rate of diagnostic testing. The most common form of testing today employs Polymerase Chain Reaction in order to identify the presence of viral RNA in individual patient samples one by one. This process has become one of the most significant bottlenecks to increased testing, especially due to reported shortages in the chemical reagents needed in the PCR reaction.

Recent technical advances have enabled High-Throughput PCR, in which multiple samples are pooled into one tube. Such methods can be highly efficient, saving large amounts of time and reagents. However, their efficiency is highly dependent on the frequency of positive samples, which varies significantly across regions and even within regions as testing criterion and conditions change.

Here, we present two possible optimized pooling strategies for diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 testing on large scales, both addressing dynamic conditions. In the first, we employ a simple information-theoretic heuristic to derive a highly efficient re-pooling protocol: an estimate of the target frequency determines the initial pool size, and any subsequent pools found positive are re-pooled at half-size and tested again. In the range of very rare target (<0.05), this approach can reduce the number of necessary tests dramatically, for example, achieving a reduction by a factor of 50 for a target frequency of 0.001. The second method is a simpler approach of optimized one-time pooling followed by individual tests on positive pools. We show that this approach is just as efficient for moderate target-product frequencies (0.05<0.2), for example, achieving a two-fold in the number of when the frequency of positive samples is 0.07.

These strategies require little investment, and they offer a significant reduction in the amount of materials, equipment and time needed to test large numbers of samples. We show that both these pooling strategies are roughly comparable to the absolute upper-bound efficiency given by Shannons source coding theorem. We compare our strategies to the naive way of testing and to alternative matrix-pooling methods. Most importantly, we offer straightforward, practical pooling instructions for laboratories that perform large scale PCR assays to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. These two pooling strategies may offer ways to alleviate the bottleneck currently preventing massive expansion of SARS-CoV-2 testing around the world.","Shani-Narkiss, H.; Gilday, O.

17482,U-shaped-aggressiveness of SARS-CoV-2: Period between initial symptoms and clinical progression to COVID-19 suspicion. A population-based cohort study,"BackgroundEarly identification of different COVID-19 clinical presentations may depict distinct pathophysiological mechanisms and guide management strategies.

ObjectiveTo determine the aggressiveness of SARS-CoV-2 using symptom progression in COVID-19 patients.

DesignHistoric cohort study of Mexican patients. Data from January-April 2020 were provided by the Health Ministry.

SettingPopulation-based. Patients registered in the Epidemiologic Surveillance System in Mexico.

ParticipantsSubjects who sought medical attention for clinical suspicion of COVID-19. All patients were subjected to RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2.

MeasurementsWe measured the Period between initial symptoms and clinical progression to COVID-19 suspicion (PISYCS) and compared it to the primary outcomes (mortality and pneumonia).

Results65,500 patients were included. Reported fatalities and pneumonia were 2176 (3.32%), and 11568 (17.66%), respectively. According to the PISYCS, patients were distributed as follows: 14.89% in <24 hours, 43.25% between 1-3 days, 31.87% between 4-7 days and 9.97% >7 days. The distribution for mortality and pneumonia was 5.2% and 22.5% in <24 hours, 2.5% and 14% between 1-3 days, 3.6% and 19.5% between 4-7 days, 4.1% and 20.6% >7 days, respectively (p<0.001). Adjusted-risk of mortality was (OR [95% CI], p-value): <24 hours= 1.75 [1.55-1.98], p<0.001; 1-3 days= 1 (reference value); 4-7 days= 1.53 [1.37-1.70], p<0.001; >7 days= 1.67 [1.44-1.94], p<0.001. For pneumonia: <24 hours= 1.49 [1.39-1.58], p<0.001; 1-3 days= 1; 4-7 days= 1.48 [1.41-1.56], p<0.001; >7 days= 1.57 [1.46-1.69], p<0.001.

LimitationsUsing a database fed by large numbers of people carries the risk of data inaccuracy. However, this imprecision is expected to be random and data are consistent with previous studies.

ConclusionThe PISYCS shows a U-shaped SARS-CoV-2 aggressiveness pattern. Further studies are needed to corroborate the time-related pathophysiology behind these findings.","Morgenstern-Kaplan, D.; Buitano-Tang, B.; Martinez-Gil, M.; Zaldivar-Perez Pavon, A.; Talavera, J.

24991,Vaccination of Front-Line Workers with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine: Benefits in the Face of Increased Risk for Prothrombotic Thrombocytopenia,"BackgroundIn March 2021, a number of regulatory and advisory bodies around the world recommended against using the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in younger adults pending further review of the risk for vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT). As an example, we consider the Canadian province of British Columbia (BC) which halted its front-line workers vaccination program with the AstraZeneca vaccine. The province received an additional 246,700 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine in the weeks before April 11th, enough to provide the first dose of vaccine to all unvaccinated front-line workers. It is unclear whether the alternative, mRNA vaccines can be immediately made available to front-line workers.

MethodsWe reviewed the latest available evidence and used compartmental modelling to 1) compare the expected number of deaths due to COVID-19 and VIPIT under the scenarios of immediately continuing vaccination of front-line workers with the AstraZeneca vaccine or delaying it in favour of mRNA vaccines from a societal perspective, and 2) compare the individual mortality risk of immediately receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine with waiting to receive an mRNA vaccine later from a personal perspective.

ResultsWe estimate that if British Columbia continues the front-line worker vaccination program with the AstraZeneca vaccine, we expect to see approximately 45,000 fewer cases of COVID-19, 800 fewer hospitalizations, 120 fewer COVID-related deaths, and 2,300 fewer cases of Long COVID from April 15th to October 1st, 2021, for an expected number of VIPIT-related deaths of 0.674 [95% CI 0.414-0.997]. In the same period and in areas of high transmission (R0=1.30), the projected excess risk of mortality due to COVID-19 and VIPIT was significantly higher in the delayed vaccination with mRNA vaccines scenario (3.5 to 4.5 times higher risk) than that of immediate vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine for those between 30 and 69 years of age. In areas with lower levels of transmission (R0=1.15), the projected excess risk of mortality was 1.8 to 3.4 times higher in the delayed vaccination with mRNA vaccines scenario for those between 30 and 69 years of age. For those under 30, immediate vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine posed a higher risk than delayed vaccination with an mRNA vaccine, regardless of the level of transmission in the community.

ConclusionsThe benefits of continuing immunization of front-line workers with the AstraZeneca vaccine far outweigh the risk both at a societal level and at a personal risk level for those over 40, and those over 30 in high-risk areas.","Adibi, A.; Mozafarihashjin, M.; Sadatsafavi, M.",2021-04-16,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.04.11.21255138,2,Amin Adibi,University of British Columbia,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.11.21255138v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.11.21255138v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
15230,Novel ELISA protocol links pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibodies with endemic coronavirus immunity and age and reveals improved serologic identification of acute COVID-19 via multi-parameter detection,"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted work, economy, and way of life. The SARS-CoV-2 virus displays unique features including widely varying symptoms and outcomes between infected individuals. Sensitive measurement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies would provide new insight into virus transmission dynamics, pre-existing cross-reactive immunity, and the nuances of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. To date, existing SARS-CoV-2 serology tests have limited utility due to insufficient detection of antibody levels lower than what is typically present after several days of symptoms. To measure lower quantities of SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA with higher resolution than existing assays, we developed a new ELISA protocol with a distinct plate washing procedure and timed plate development via use of a standard curve. This  BU ELISA method exhibits very low signal from plasma or serum samples added to uncoated wells at as low as a 1:5 dilution. Use of this method revealed circulating SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (NP) reactive antibodies from blood samples drawn prior to May 2019. Of our prepandemic cohort, no SARS-CoV-2 RBD-reactive IgG antibodies were detected in subjects over 70 years of age, and SARS-CoV-2 NP-reactive antibodies were present at similar levels to infected subjects in some individuals and very low in others. Also, samples drawn in May 2020 from two individuals with no symptoms or no known virus exposure contained SARS-CoV-2 RBD-reactive antibodies at intermediate amounts compared with other subject groups (higher than pre-pandemic and lower than confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected). The one asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 convalescent subject in our study possessed comparable amounts of SARS-CoV-2 NP-specific IgM and IgG but drastically lower IgA than the symptomatic counterparts. Also, our assay detected positive signal from samples that gave negative results in a commercially available Lateral Flow Device (LFD) and the EUA approved Abbott IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection. We propose that this improved ELISA protocol, which is straightforward to perform, low cost, and uses readily available commercial reagents, is a useful tool to elucidate new information about SARS-CoV-2 infection and has promising implications for improved detection of all analytes measurable by this platform.","Yuen, R.; Steiner, D.; Pihl, R.; Chavez, E.; Olson, A.; Baird, L.; Korkmaz, F.; Urick, P.; Sagar, M.; Berrigan, J.; Gummuluru, R.; Corley, R.; Quillen, K.; Belkina, A.; Mostoslavsky, G.; Rifkin, I.; Kataria, Y.; Cappione, A.; Lin, N.; Bhadelia, N.; Snyder-Cappione, J.; Smith, E.

10142,Clinical Outcomes of Patients with COVID-19 and Chronic Inflammatory and Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases: A Multicentric Matched-Cohort Study,"BackgroundThe impact of inflammatory rheumatic diseases on COVID-19 severity is poorly known. Here we compare the outcomes of a cohort of rheumatic patients with a matched control cohort to identify potential risk factors for severe illness.

MethodsIn this comparative cohort study, we identified hospital PCR+ COVID-19 rheumatic patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis (IA) or autoimmune/immunomediated diseases (AI/IMID). Non-rheumatic controls were randomly sampled 1:1, and matched by age, sex, and PCR date. The main outcome was severe COVID-19, defined as death, invasive ventilation, ICU admission, or serious complications. We assessed the association between the outcome and potential prognostic variables, adjusted by COVID treatment, using logistic regression.

ResultsThe cohorts were composed of 456 rheumatic and non-rheumatic patients, in equal numbers. Mean age was 63 [IQR 53-78] and male sex 41% in both cohorts. Rheumatic diseases were IA (60%) and AI/IMID (40%). Most patients (74%) had been hospitalised, and the risk of severe COVID was 31.6% in the rheumatic and 28.1% in the non-rheumatic cohort. Ageing, male sex and previous comorbidity (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular, or lung disease) increased the risk in the rheumatic cohort by bivariate analysis. In logistic regression analysis, independent factors associated with severe COVID were increased age (OR 5.31; CI 3.14-8.95), male sex (2.13; CI 1.35-3.36) and having an AI/IMID (OR 1.98; CI 1.15-3.41).

25065,A Randomized Trial of Otilimab in Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia (OSCAR),"BACKGROUNDIncreasing age is a risk factor for COVID-19 severity and mortality; emerging science implicates GM-CSF and dysregulated myeloid cell responses in the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19.

METHODSWe conducted a large, global, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating a single 90 mg infusion of otilimab (human anti-GM-CSF monoclonal) plus standard of care in adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19 respiratory failure and systemic inflammation, stratified by age and clinical status. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients alive and free of respiratory failure at Day 28; secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality at Day 60.

RESULTSOverall, 806 patients were randomized (1:1); 71% of patients receiving otilimab were alive and free of respiratory failure at Day 28 versus 67% receiving placebo, although this did not reach statistical significance (model-adjusted difference 5.3% [95% CI -0.8, 11.4]; p=0.09). However, there was a benefit in the pre-defined [&ge;]70-year age group (model-adjusted difference 19.1% [95% CI 5.2, 33.1]; nominal p=0.009); these patients also had a reduction of 14.4% (95% CI 0.9, 27.9%; nominal p=0.04) in model-adjusted all-cause mortality at Day 60. Safety findings were comparable between otilimab and placebo, and consistent with severe COVID-19.

CONCLUSIONSAlthough not statistically significant in the overall population, otilimab demonstrated a substantial benefit in patients aged [&ge;]70, possibly reflecting a population that could benefit from therapeutic blocking of GM-CSF in severe COVID-19 where myeloid cell dysregulation is predominant.

5866,Dominant extrafollicular B cell responses in severe COVID-19 disease correlate with robust viral-specific antibody production but poor clinical outcomes,"Abstract/IntroductionA wide clinical spectrum has become a hallmark of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, although its immunologic underpinnings remain to be defined. We have performed deep characterization of B cell responses through high-dimensional flow cytometry to reveal substantial heterogeneity in both effector and immature populations. More notably, critically ill patients displayed hallmarks of extrafollicular B cell activation as previously described in autoimmune settings. Extrafollicular activation correlated strongly with large antibody secreting cell expansion and early production of high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Yet, these patients fared poorly with elevated inflammatory biomarkers, multi-organ failure, and death. Combined, the findings strongly indicate a major pathogenic role for immune activation in subsets of COVID-19 patients. Our study suggests that, as in autoimmunity, targeted immunomodulatory therapy may be beneficial in specific patient subpopulations that can be identified by careful immune profiling.","Woodruff, M.; Ramonell, R.; Cashman, K.; Nguyen, D.; Saini, A.; Haddad, N.; Ley, A.; Kyu, S.; Howell, J.

4849,Prioritisation of potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug repurposing opportunities based on ability to achieve adequate target site concentrations derived from their established human pharmacokinetics,"There is a rapidly expanding literature on the in vitro antiviral activity of drugs that may be repurposed for therapy or chemoprophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. However, this has not been accompanied by a comprehensive evaluation of the ability of these drugs to achieve target plasma and lung concentrations following approved dosing in humans. Moreover, most publications have focussed on 50% maximum effective concentrations (EC50), which may be an insufficiently robust indicator of antiviral activity because of marked differences in the slope of the concentration-response curve between drugs. Accordingly, in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity data was digitised from all available publications up to 13th April 2020 and used to recalculate an EC90 value for each drug. EC90 values were then expressed as a ratio to the achievable maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) reported for each drug after administration of the approved dose to humans (Cmax/EC90 ratio). Only 14 of the 56 analysed drugs achieved a Cmax/EC90 ratio above 1 meaning that plasma Cmax concentrations exceeded those necessary to inhibit 90% of SARS-CoV-2 replication. A more in-depth assessment of the putative agents tested demonstrated that only nitazoxanide, nelfinavir, tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir) and sulfadoxine achieved plasma concentrations above their reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity across their entire approved dosing interval at their approved human dose. For all drugs reported, the unbound lung to plasma tissue partition coefficient (KpUlung) was also simulated and used along with reported Cmax and fraction unbound in plasma to derive a lung Cmax/EC50 as a better indicator of potential human efficacy (lung Cmax/EC90 ratio was also calculable for a limited number of drugs). Using this parameter hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, mefloquine, atazanavir (boosted with ritonavir), tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir), ivermectin, azithromycin and lopinavir (boosted with ritonavir) were all predicted to achieve lung concentrations over 10-fold higher than their reported EC50. This analysis was not possible for nelfinavir because insufficient data were available to calculate KpUlung but nitozoxanide and sulfadoxine were also predicted to exceed their reported EC50 by 3.1- and 1.5-fold in lung, respectively. The antiviral activity data reported to date have been acquired under different laboratory conditions across multiple groups, applying variable levels of stringency. However, this analysis may be used to select potential candidates for further clinical testing, while deprioritising compounds which are unlikely to attain target concentrations for antiviral activity. Future studies should focus on EC90 values and discuss findings in the context of achievable exposures in humans, especially within target compartments such as the lung, in order to maximise the potential for success of proposed human clinical trials.","Arshad, U.; Pertinez, H.; Box, H.; Tatham, L.; Rajoli, R.

25281,Infants have lower RT-PCR cycle threshold for SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with older children and adults,"Background: The viral dynamics and the role of children in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 are not completely understood. Our aim was to evaluate RT-PCR Ct values among children with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 compared with that of adult subjects. Methods: Patients (aged from 2 months to [&le;]18 years, and adults) with signs and symptoms of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection for less than 7 days, were prospectively enrolled in the study from May to November 2020. All participants performed RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection; Ct values of ORF1ab, N, and S gene-targets, and the average of all the three probes were used as surrogates of viral load. Results: There were 21 infants, 62 children and 293 adults of 376 participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. RT-PCR Ct values of children under 18 were not significantly different from that of adults after adjusting for days of illness, as observed by the analyzed probes (namely ORF1ab, N, and S), and by the mean of all 3 gene-targets. Conclusions: Ct values for children were comparable to that of adults. Days of illness are a major confounder for SARS-CoV-2 viral load and must be adjusted in any comparison. Although viral load is not the only determinant of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, children may play a significant role in the spread of in the community.","Polese-Bonatto, M.; Sartor, I. T.

7634,Serologic responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection among hospital staff with mild disease in eastern France,"BackgroundThe serologic response of individuals with mild forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection is poorly characterized.

MethodsHospital staff who had recovered from mild forms of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two assays: a rapid immunodiagnostic test (99.4% specificity) and the S-Flow assay ([~]99% specificity).The neutralizing activity of the sera was tested with a pseudovirus-based assay.

ResultsOf 162 hospital staff who participated in the investigation, 160 reported SARS-CoV-2 infection that had not required hospital admission and were included in these analyses. The median time from symptom onset to blood sample collection was 24 days (IQR: 21-28, range 13-39). The rapid immunodiagnostic test detected antibodies in 153 (95.6%) of the samples and the S-Flow assay in 159 (99.4%), failing to detect antibodies in one sample collected 18 days after symptom onset (the rapid test did not detect antibodies in that patient). Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were detected in 79%, 92% and 98% of samples collected 13-20, 21-27 and 28-41 days after symptom onset, respectively (P=0.02).

ConclusionAntibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in virtually all hospital staff sampled from 13 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. This finding supports the use of serologic testing for the diagnosis of individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The neutralizing activity of the antibodies increased overtime. Future studies will help assess the persistence of the humoral response and its associated neutralization capacity in recovered patients.","Fafi-Kremer, S.; Bruel, T.; Madec, Y.; Grant, R.; Tondeur, L.; Grzelak, L.; Staropoli, I.; Anna, F.; Souque, P.; Mutter, C.; Collongues, N.; Bolle, A.; Velay, A.; Lefebvre, N.; Mielcarek, M.; Meyer, N.; Rey, D.; Charneau, P.; Hoen, B.; De Seze, J.; Schwartz, O.; Fontanet, A.",2020-05-22,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.19.20101832,2,Samira Fafi-Kremer,CHRU Strasbourg,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20101832v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20101832v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.102915
25535,"Antibody response after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in relation to age, sex, and side effects","BackgroundThe mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV2 have proven highly effective and are currently used to vaccinate all age groups against COVID-19. Despite their high efficacy in clinical trials, there is limited data on the impact of age, sex, and side effects on vaccine-induced immune responses.

MethodsWe here studied the development of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein RBD domain antibodies after two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine in 118 healthy volunteers and correlated their immune response with age, sex, and side effects reported after the vaccinations.

FindingsOur findings show a robust immune response to the Spike proteins RBD region after the first and the second vaccination dose. However, we also saw a decline of antibody levels at 6 weeks versus 1 week after the second dose, suggesting a waning of the immune response over time. Regardless of this, the antibody levels at 6 weeks after the second dose remained significantly higher than before the vaccination, after the first dose, or in COVID-19 convalescent individuals. We found a decreased vaccination efficacy but fewer adverse events in older individuals, and that mRNA vaccination is less efficient in older males whereas the detrimental impact of age on vaccination outcome is abolished in females at 6 weeks after the second dose.

InterpretationThe Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine induces a strong immune response after two doses of vaccination but older individuals develop fewer side effects and decreased antibody levels at 6 weeks. The waning of anti-viral antibodies in particular in older male individuals suggests that both age and male sex act as risk factors in the immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine.

FundingThe study was supported by the Centre of Excellence in Translational Genomics (EXCEGEN), and the Estonian Research Council grant PRG377 and SYNLAB Estonia.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe first studies addressing the immune responses in older individuals after the single-dose administration of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines have been published. We searched PubMed and medRxiv for publications on the immune response of SARS-CoV-2-mRNA vaccines, published in English, using the search terms """"SARS-CoV-2"""", """"COVID-19"""", """"vaccine response"""", """"mRNA vaccine"""", up to April 15th, 2021. To date, most mRNA vaccine response studies have not been peer-reviewed, and data on the role of age, sex and side effects on SARS-CoV-2-mRNA vaccines in real vaccination situations is limited. Some studies have found a weaker immune response in older individuals after the first dose and these have been measured at a relatively short period (within 1-2 weeks) after the first dose but little longer-term evidence exists on the postvaccination antibody persistence. Even less information is available on sex differences or correlations with mRNA vaccine side effects.

Added value of this studyIn this study, we assessed the antibody response up to 6 weeks after the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine in 118 individuals. Our findings show a strong initial immune response after the first dose and an even higher Spike RBD antibody levels at 1 week after the second dose, but these significantly declined at 6 weeks after the second dose. We also found a weaker immune response and faster waning of antibodies in older vaccinated individuals, which correlated with fewer side effects at the time of vaccinations. Furthermore, although overall female and male vaccinees responded similarly, we found that age-related waning of the vaccine-related antibodies was stronger amongst older males whereas in females the impact of age was lost at 6 weeks after the second dose.

Implications of all the available evidenceNew mRNA vaccines are now applied worldwide as they have shown high efficacy in clinical trials. Our results show that two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine induce a strong antibody response to Spike RBD region but these high levels decline 1.5 months after the second dose in most of the vaccinated individuals. Nevertheless, even at 6 weeks after the second dose, they stay significantly higher than at prevaccination, after the first dose of vaccine, or in Covid-19 postinfection. These findings also implicate that fewer adverse effects may indicate lower antibody response after the vaccination and point to the need for more individualized vaccination protocols, in particular among older people.","Naaber, P.; Jurjenson, V.; Adamson, A.; Sepp, E.; Tserel, L.; Kisand, K.; Peterson, P.",2021-04-27,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.04.19.21255714,1,Paul Naaber,SYNLAB Eesti; University of Tartu,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.19.21255714v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.19.21255714v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA

5799,Control with uncertain data of socially structured compartmental epidemic models,"The adoption of containment measures to reduce the amplitude of the epidemic peak is a key aspect in tackling the rapid spread of an epidemic. Classical compartmental models must be modified and studied to correctly describe the effects of forced external actions to reduce the impact of the disease. In addition, data are often incomplete and heterogeneous, so a high degree of uncertainty must naturally be incorporated into the models. In this work we address both these aspects, through an optimal control formulation of the epidemiological model in presence of uncertain data. After the introduction of the optimal control problem, we formulate an instantaneous approximation of the control that allows us to derive new feedback controlled compartmental models capable of describing the epidemic peak reduction. The need for long-term interventions shows that alternative actions based on the social structure of the system can be as effective as the more expensive global strategy. The importance of the timing and intensity of interventions is particularly relevant in the case of uncertain parameters on the actual number of infected people. Simulations related to data from the recent COVID-19 outbreak in Italy are presented and discussed.","Albi, G.; Pareschi, L.; Zanella, M.",2020-05-02,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.27.20081885,1,Mattia Zanella,University of Pavia,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.27.20081885v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.27.20081885v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

We investigate potential pitfalls and areas for improvement by extending an existing branching process contact tracing model, adding diagnostic testing and refining parameter estimates. Our results demonstrate that reporting and adherence are the most important predictors of programme impact but tracing coverage and speed plus diagnostic sensitivity also play an important role. We conclude that well-implemented contact tracing could bring small but potentially important benefits to controlling and preventing outbreaks, providing up to a 15% reduction in R, and reaffirm that contact tracing is not currently appropriate as the sole control measure.","Davis, E.

11414,What cost decisiveness? A cost benefit analysis of the lockdown to contain COVID-19 in India,"On 24th March, 2020 the Government of India announced a national level lockdown to contain the spread of COVID. The lockdown policy has generated considerable controversy, with critics arguing that it was done without adequate notice or planning, exposed vulnerable section of the population to a humanitarian crisis, and failed to contain the spread of COVID. In response, the Government has claimed that lockdown slowed the transmission process of COVID, thereby reducing the number of cases and deaths substantially. The consequent pressure on the health infrastructure was also much less. To judge between competing claims, this study has undertaken the first cost-benefit analysis of the worlds biggest lockdown. Although the data for a proper cost-benefit analysis is currently not available, we have made a ball point estimate of the net benefit of the lockdown under alternative scenarios. Our estimates reveal the net benefits of lockdown to be negative; moreover, the results are robust under all scenarios.","Dutta, M.; Husain, Z.",2020-07-17,Health Policy,10.1101/2020.07.07.20148338,2,Mousumi Dutta,"Presidency University, Kolkata, India",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.20148338v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.20148338v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
13717,Comprehensive Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 Spread Using Wastewater-based Epidemiology Studies,"SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is having a devastating effect on human lives. Individuals who are symptomatic/asymptomatic or have recovered are reported to have/will have serious health complications in the future, which is going to be huge economic burden globally. Given the wide-spread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 it is almost impossible to test each and every individual for the same and isolate them. Recent reports have shown that sewage can be used as a holistic approach to estimate the epidemiology of the virus. Here we have estimated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the city of Hyderabad, India which is populated with nearly 10 million people. The sewage samples were collected from all the major sewage treatment plants (STPs) and were processed for detecting the viral genome using the standard RT-PCR method. Based on the average viral particle shedding per individual, the total number of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (in a window of 35 days) is about 6.6% of the population, which clearly indicates the rate of community transmission and asymptomatic carriers is higher than the number of reported cases. It is important to note here that the samples collected from the inlet of STPs were positive for SARS-CoV-2, while the outlets were negative indicating the efficient treatment of sewage at STPs. These studies are going to be essential to manage the pandemic better and also to assess the effectiveness of control measure.","Manupati, H.; Kiran, U.; Kuncha, S. K.; Kopperi, H.; C.g., G.; S., V.

18256,No evidence of increase in suicide in Greece during the first wave of Covid-19,"Background and ObjectiveMental health outcomes have reportedly worsened in several countries during the Covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns. In the present study we examined whether suicides increased in Greece during the first wave of the pandemic.

MethodsWe used daily suicide estimates from a Suicide Observatory in Greece from 2015-2020 and followed three methodologies: A descriptive approach, an interrupted time series analysis, and a differences-in-differences econometric model.

ResultsWe did not find any empirical evidence of any increase in suicides during the first wave of Covid-19 and the lockdown in any of the three approaches used.

ConclusionsSuicides did not seem to increase during the first wave of covid-19 and lockdown in Greece. However, this does not mean that mental health did not deteriorate, or that we will not observe an increase in suicides during the second wave. Protective factors for Greece during the first wave may include working from home (for those able to tele-work), strong family ties, advertising of a suicide hotline and income support for the unemployed.","Vandoros, S.; Theodorikakou, O.; Katsadoros, K.; Zafeiropoulou, D.; Kawachi, I.",2020-11-16,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.11.13.20231571,1,Sotiris Vandoros,"King\'s College London and Harvard T.H.

5226,Modelling the potential impact of social distancing on the COVID-19 epidemic in South Africa,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to be a global health problem whose impact has been significantly felt in South Africa. Social distancing has been touted as the best form of response in managing a rapid increase in the number of infected cases. In this paper, we present a deterministic model to model the impact of social distancing on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in South Africa. The model is fitted to the currently available data on the cumulative number of infected cases and a scenario analysis on different levels of social distancing are presented. The results show a continued rise in the number of cases in the lock down period with the current levels of social distancing albeit at a lower rate. The model shows that the number of cases will rise to above 4000 cases by the end of the lockdown. The model also looks at the impact of relaxing the social distancing measures after the initial announcement of the lock down measures. A relaxation of the social distancing by 2% can result in a 23% rise in the number of cumulative cases while on the other hand increasing the levels of social distancing by 2% would reduce the number of cumulative cases by about 18%. These results have implications on the management and policy direction in the early phases of the epidemic.","Nyabadza, F.; Chirove, F.; Chukwu, W. C.; Visaya, M.

8547,A survey of the psychological status of primary school students who were quarantined at home during the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in Hangzhou China,"ObjectiveTo investigate the presence of social anxiety and depression and the risk factors for them among primary school students who were quarantined at home during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Hangzhou China.

MethodsA total of 1620 students who were quarantined at home for at least one month were recruited from two primary schools in Hangzhou. Students completed a questionnaire on a mobile App with help from their guardians; the measures included demographic and general information, the Social Anxiety Scale for Children (SASC), and the Depression Self-rating Scalefor Children (DSRSC).

ResultsThe mean SASC score of the participants was 3.90 {+/-} 3.73, which was higher than the mean norm score of Chinese urban children (3.48 {+/-} 3.47) (P < 0.01). The mean DSRSC score of the participants (5.67 {+/-} 4.97) was much lower than the mean norm score of Chinese urban children (9.84 {+/-} 4.73) (P < 0.05). A total of 279 (17.2%) students had social anxiety, with a mean score of 10.41 {+/-} 2.59, and 102 (6.3%) students had depression, with a mean score of 18.96 {+/-} 3.89. The following variables were found to be significant risk factors for social anxiety during home quarantine: deterioration of the parent-child relationship, increased conflicts with parents, irregular work and rest, and worrying more about being infected. Deterioration of the parent-child relationship, less physical activity, irregular work and rest, and negative mood during home quarantine were significant risk factors for depression.

ConclusionPrimary school students who were quarantined at home during the COVID-19 epidemic were more likely to have social anxiety but less likely to have depressive symptoms. Poor parent-child relationships, irregularity of work and rest, and epidemic-related problems were the main reasons for psychological problems. Families, schools, and social organizations need to pay more attention to the psychological status of primary school students quarantined at home.","Zheng, Y.; Li, J.; Zhang, M.; Jin, B.; Li, X.; Cao, Z.; Wu, N.; Jin, C.",2020-06-01,Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology,10.1101/2020.05.28.20115311,2,Changzhong Jin,"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.20115311v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.20115311v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

In Mexico City, healthcare workers represent an important fraction of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This work aims to estimate the frequency of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and identify associated factors in healthcare workers at a large hospital in Mexico City. We conducted a serological survey in a non-COVID national referral teaching hospital. We selected a representative sample of 300 individuals. Blood samples were collected and questionnaires were applied between August 10th and September 9th, 2020. ELISA results indicate a serological prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection of 13.0%. Working in the janitorial and security groups, having an educational level below a university degree, and living with a larger number of people, were also identified as sociodemographic factors that increase the risk of having SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, less favored socioeconomic groups are at significantly higher risk of experiencing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Even in healthcare workers there is still a majority of individuals that are seronegative, and thus the risk of continued epidemic waves and mortality remains high.","Cruz-Arenas, E.; Cabrera-Ruiz, E.; Laguna-Barcenas, S.; Colin-Castro, C.

The aim of this study was to assess the behavioral determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and to provide recommendations to increase the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in Bangladesh.

MethodsWe employed a Barrier Analysis (BA) approach to examine twelve potential behavioral determinants (drawn from the Health Belief Model and Theory of Reasoned Action [TRA]) of intended vaccine acceptance. We conducted 45 interviews with those who intended to take the vaccine (Acceptors) and another 45 interviews with those who did not have that intention (Non-acceptors). We performed data analysis to find statistically significant differences and to identify which beliefs were most highly associated with acceptance and non-acceptance with COVID-19 vaccines.

ResultsCOVID-19 vaccine Acceptors in Dhaka were different from Non-acceptors in terms of many of their beliefs and responses. The behavioral determinants associated with the behavior included perceived social norms, perceived safety of COVID-19 vaccines and trust in them, perceived risk/susceptibility, perceived self-efficacy, perceived positive and negative consequences, perceived action efficacy, perceived severity of COVID-19, access, and perceived divine will. In line with the Health Belief Model, beliefs about the disease itself were highly correlated with vaccine acceptance, although not the only determinant. Other responses of Acceptors provide clues such as providing vaccination through government health facilities, schools, and kiosks, and having vaccinators maintain proper COVID-19 health and safety protocols as to ways to make it easier to boost acceptance.

ConclusionAn effective behavior change strategy for COVID-19 vaccines uptake will need to address multiple beliefs and behavioral determinants, reducing barriers and leveraging enablers identified in this study. The national plans on COVID-19 vaccination should adopt culturally and community label acceptable and appropriate evidence-based behavior change interventions strategies to promote high vaccination coverage and acceptance in all societal structures across the country.","Kalam, M.

Sample pooling is a method that aims to multiply testing capability by using one testing kit for multiple samples, but will only be successful under certain conditions.

The analysis reveals that there has been little impact of the nation-wide lockdown and subsequent extension on the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country and there is no empirical evidence to suggest that relaxations under the third and the fourth phase of the lockdown have resulted in a spike in the reported confirmed cases. The analysis also suggests that if the current trend continues, in the immediate future, then the daily reported confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country is likely to increase to 21 thousand by 15 June 2020 whereas the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 will increase to around 422 thousand. The analysis calls for a population-wide testing approach to check the increase in the reported confirmed cases of COVID-19.","Chaurasia, A.

2776,A framework for identifying regional outbreak and spread of COVID-19 from one-minute population-wide surveys,"Coronavirus infection spreads in clusters and therefore early identification of these clusters is critical for slowing down the spread of the virus. Here, we propose that daily population-wide surveys that assess the development of symptoms caused by the virus could serve as a strategic and valuable tool for identifying such clusters to inform epidemiologists, public health officials, and policy makers. We show preliminary results from a survey of over 58,000 Israelis and call for an international consortium to extend this concept in order to develop predictive models. We expect such data to allow: Faster detection of spreading zones and patients; Obtaining a current snapshot of the number of people in each area who have developed symptoms; Predicting future spreading zones several days before an outbreak occurs; Evaluating the effectiveness of the various social distancing measures taken, and their contribution to reduce the number of symptomatic people. Such information can provide a valuable tool for decision makers to decide which areas need strengthening of social distancing measures and which areas can be relieved. Preliminary analysis shows that in neighborhoods with confirmed COVID-19 patient history, more responders report on COVID-19 associated symptoms, demonstrating the potential utility of our approach for detection of outbreaks. Researchers from other countries including the U.S, India, Italy, Spain, Germany, Mexico, Finland, Sweden, Norway and several others have adopted our approach and we are collaborating to further improve it. We call with urgency for other countries to join this international consortium, and to share methods and data collected from these daily, simple, one-minute surveys.","Rossman, H.; Keshet, A.; Shilo, S.; Gavrieli, A.; Bauman, T.; Cohen, O.; Balicer, R.; Geiger, B.; Dor, Y.; Segal, E.",2020-03-27,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.19.20038844,2,Eran Segal,Weizmann Institute of Science,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038844v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038844v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.1038/s41591-020-0857-9
17584,Availability of personal protective equipment and satisfaction of healthcare professionals during COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia,"Healthcare professionals (HCPs) are at the frontline in the fight against COVID-19 and are at an increased risk of becoming infected with coronavirus. Risk of infection can be minimized by use of proper personal protective equipment (PPE). This study assessed the availability of PPE and satisfaction of HCPs in six public hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted from 9th to 26th June 2020. The study hospitals included: Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Zewditu Memorial Hospital, Ghandi Memorial Hospital, Menelik II Hospital, Yekatit 12 Hospital Medical College and St. Paul Hospital Millennium Medical College. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the data and Chi-square test was used to assess the association between the groups. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with the satisfaction level of healthcare workers with regard to the availability and use of proper PPE during the current COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1,134 (92.3%) valid questionnaires from a possible 1,228 were included in the analysis. The mean ({+/-}SD) age of the participants was 30.26{+/-}6.43 year and 52.6% were females. Nurses constituted about 40% of the overall sample, followed by physicians (22.2%), interns (10.8%), midwives (10.3%) and others (16.7%). An overall shortage of PPE was reported in all study hospitals. The majority (77%) of the healthcare professionals reported that their hospital did not have adequate PPE. A critical shortage of N95 respirator was particularly reported, the self-reported availability of N95 increased from 13% to 24% before and during COVID-19, respectively. The self-reported use of N95 increased from 9% to 21% before and during COVID-19, respectively. Almost 72% of the respondents were dissatisfied with the availability of PPE in their hospital. The independent predictors of the respondents satisfaction level about PPE were male gender (adjusted OR=1.39, 95% CI:1.05-1.85), healthcare workers who reported that PPE was adequately available in the hospital (adjusted OR=7.53, 95% CI:5.08-11.16), and preparedness to provide care to COVID-19 cases (adjusted OR=1.65, 95% CI:1.22-2.12). A critical shortage of appropriate PPE both before and during COVID-19 was identified. The high level of dissatisfaction with the availability of PPE might potentially lead to a lower level of preparedness and readiness to fight against COVID-19. Therefore, urgent efforts are needed to adequately supply the healthcare facilities with appropriate PPE to alleviate the challenges.","Deressa, W.; Worku, A.; Abebe, W.; Gizaw, M.; Amogne, W.",2020-11-03,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.30.20223149,1,Wakgari Deressa,"School of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.20223149v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.20223149v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

6133,Worldwide Effectiveness of Various Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention Control Strategies on the Global COVID-19 Pandemic: A Linearised Control Model,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is a virus which has lead to a global pandemic. Worldwide, more than 130 countries have imposed severe restrictions, which form part of a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI)s. We aimed to quantify the country-specific effects of these NPIs and compare them using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) stringency index, p, as a measure of NPI stringency.

MethodsWe developed a dual latent/observable Susceptible Infected Recovered Deaths (SIRD) model and applied it on each of 22 countries and 25 states in the US using publicly available data. The observable model parameters were extracted using kernel functions. The regression of the transmission rate, {beta}, as a function of p in each locale was modeled through the intervention leverage, s, an initial transmission rate, {beta}0 and a typical adjustment time, [Formula].

ResultsThe world average for the intervention leverage, s = 0.01 (95% CI 0.0102 - 0.0112) had an ensemble standard deviation of 0.0017 (95% C.I. 0.0014 - 0.0021), strongly indicating a universal behavior.

DiscussionOur study indicates that removing NPIs too swiftly will result in the resurgence of the spread within one to two months, in alignment with the current WHO recommendations. Moreover, we have quantified and are able to predict the effect of various combinations of NPIs. There is a minimum NPI level, below which leads to resurgence of the outbreak (in the absence of pharmaceutical and clinical advances). For the epidemic to remain sub-critical, the rate with which the intervention leverage s increases should outpace that of the relaxation of NPIs.","Naude, J.; Mellado, B.; Choma, J.; Correa, F.; Dahbi, S.; Dwolatzky, B.; Dwolatzky, L.; Hayasi, K.; Lieberman, B.; Maslo, C.; Monnakgotla, K.; Ruan, X.; Stevenson, F.",2020-05-12,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.30.20085316,2,Bruce Mellado,University of the Witwatersrand,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.30.20085316v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.30.20085316v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
6799,Success of prophylactic antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2: predicted critical efficacies and impact of different drug-specific mechanisms of action,"Repurposed drugs that are immediately available and safe to use constitute a first line of defense against new viral infections. Despite limited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, several drugs are being tested as medication or as prophylaxis to prevent infection. Using a stochastic model of early phase infection, we find that a critical efficacy above 87% is needed to block viral establishment. This can be improved by combination therapy. Below the critical efficacy, establishment of infection can sometimes be prevented, most effectively with drugs blocking viral entry into cells or enhancing viral clearance. Even when a viral infection cannot be prevented, antivirals delay the time to detectable viral loads. This delay flattens the within-host viral dynamic curve, possibly reducing transmission and symptom severity. Thus, antiviral prophylaxis, even with reduced efficacy, could be efficiently used to prevent or alleviate infection in people at high risk.","Czuppon, P.; Debarre, F.; Goncalves, A.; Tenaillon, O.; Perelson, A.

4120,How much of SARS-CoV-2 Infections is India detecting? A model-based estimation,"Background and RationaleAmid SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the low number of infections for a population size of 1.38 billion is widely discussed, but with no definite answers.

MethodsWe used the model proposed by Bommer and Vollmer to assess the quality of official case records. The infection fatality rates were taken from Verity et al (2020). Age distribution of the population for India and states are taken from the Census of India (2011). Reported number of deaths and SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases from https://www.covid19india.org. The reported numbers of samples tests were collected from the reports of the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).

ResultsThe findings suggest that India is detecting just 3.6% of the total number of infections with a huge variation across its states. Among 13 states which have more than 100 COVID-19 cases, the detection rate varies from 81.9% (of 410 estimated infections) in Kerala to 0.8% (of 35487 estimated infections) in Madhya Pradesh and 2.4% (of 7431 estimated infections) in Gujarat.

ConclusionAs the study reports a lower number of deaths and higher recovery rates in the states with a high detection rate, thus suggest that India must enhance its testing capacity and go for widespread testing. Late detection puts patients in greater need of mechanical ventilation and ICU care, which imposes greater costs on the health system. The country should also adopt population-level random testing to assess the prevalence of the infection.","Goli, S.; James, K.

18018,A time-resolved proteomic and diagnostic map characterizes COVID-19 disease progression and predicts outcome,"COVID-19 is highly variable in its clinical presentation, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe organ damage and death. There is an urgent need for predictive markers that can guide clinical decision-making, inform about the effect of experimental therapies, and point to novel therapeutic targets. Here, we characterize the time-dependent progression of COVID-19 through different stages of the disease, by measuring 86 accredited diagnostic parameters and plasma proteomes at 687 sampling points, in a cohort of 139 patients during hospitalization. We report that the time-resolved patient molecular phenotypes reflect an initial spike in the systemic inflammatory response, which is gradually alleviated and followed by a protein signature indicative of tissue repair, metabolic reconstitution and immunomodulation. Further, we show that the early host response is predictive for the disease trajectory and gives rise to proteomic and diagnostic marker signatures that classify the need for supplemental oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation, and that predict the time to recovery of mildly ill patients. In severely ill patients, the molecular phenotype of the early host response predicts survival, in two independent cohorts and weeks before outcome. We also identify age-specific molecular response to COVID-19, which involves increased inflammation and lipoprotein dysregulation in older patients. Our study provides a deep and time resolved molecular characterization of COVID-19 disease progression, and reports biomarkers for risk-adapted treatment strategies and molecular disease monitoring.

14771,Hydroxychloroquine for prevention of COVID-19 mortality: a population-based cohort study,"BackgroundHydroxychloroquine has been shown to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, but early clinical studies found no benefit treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We set out to evaluate the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for prevention, as opposed to treatment, of COVID-19 mortality.

MethodsWe pre-specified and conducted an observational, population-based cohort study using national primary care data and linked death registrations in the OpenSAFELY platform, representing 40% of the general population in England. We used Cox regression to estimate the association between ongoing routine hydroxychloroquine use prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in England and risk of COVID-19 mortality among people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Model adjustment was informed by a directed acyclic graph.

ResultsOf 194,637 patients with RA or SLE, 30,569 (15.7%) received [&ge;] 2 prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine in the six months prior to 1 March 2020. Between 1 March 2020 and 13 July 2020, there were 547 COVID-19 deaths, 70 among hydroxychloroquine users. Estimated standardised cumulative COVID-19 mortality was 0.23% (95% CI 0.18-0.29) among users and 0.22% (95% CI 0.20-0.25) among non-users; an absolute difference of 0.008% (95% CI -0.051-0.066). After accounting for age, sex, ethnicity, use of other immunuosuppressives, and geographic region, no association with COVID-19 mortality was observed (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.80-1.33). We found no evidence of interactions with age or other immunosuppressives. Quantitative bias analyses indicated observed associations were robust to missing information regarding additional biologic treatments for rheumatological disease. We observed similar associations with the negative control outcome of non-COVID-19 mortality.

ConclusionWe found no evidence of a difference in COVID-19 mortality among patients who received hydroxychloroquine for treatment of rheumatological disease prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in England.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPublished trials and observational studies to date have shown no evidence of benefit of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for hospitalised patients who already have COVID-19. A separate question remains: whether routine ongoing use of hydroxychloroquine in people without COVID-19 protects against new infections or severe outcomes. We searched MEDLINE/PubMed for pharmacoepidemiological studies evaluating hydroxychloroquine for prevention of severe COVID-19 outcomes. The keywords """"hydroxychloroquine AND (COVID OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (prophyl* OR prevent*) AND (rate OR hazard OR odds OR risk)"""" were used and results were filtered to articles from the last year with abstracts available. 109 papers were identified for screening; none investigated pre-exposure prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine for prevention of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Clinical trials of prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine are ongoing; however, the largest trial does not expect to meet recruitment targets due to """"...unjustified extrapolation and exaggerated safety concerns together with intense politicisation and negative publicity."""" In the absence of reported clinical trials, evidence can be generated from real-world data to support the need for randomised clinical trials.

Added value of this studyIn this cohort study representing 40% of the population of England, we investigated whether routine use of hydroxychloroquine prior to the COVID-19 outbreak prevented COVID-19 mortality. Using robust pharmacoepidemiological methods, we found no evidence to support a substantial benefit of hydroxychloroquine in preventing COVID-19 mortality. At the same time, we have shown no significant harm, and this generates the equipoise to justify continuing randomised trials. We have demonstrated in this study that it is feasible to address specific hypotheses about medicines in a rapid and transparent manner to inform interim clinical decision making and support the need for large-scale, randomised trial data.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis is the first study to investigate the ongoing routine use of hydroxychloroquine and risk of COVID-19 mortality in a general population. While we found no evidence of any protective benefit, due to the observational nature of the study, residual confounding remains a possibility. Completion of trials for prevention of severe outcomes is warranted, but prior to the completion of these, we found no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine for prevention of COVID-19 mortality.","Rentsch, C.

21910,Arabic validation and cross-cultural adaptation of the 5C scale for assessment of COVID-19 vaccines psychological antecedents,"BackgroundIn the Arab countries, there has not been yet a specific validated questionnaire that can assess the psychological antecedents of COVID-19 vaccine among the general population. This study, therefore, aimed to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the 5C scale into the Arabic language.

MethodsThe 5C scale was translated into Arabic by two independent bilingual co-authors, and then subsequently translated back into English. After reconciling translation disparities, the final Arabic questionnaire was disseminated into four randomly selected Arabic countries (Egypt, Libya, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Saudi Arabia). Data from 350 Arabic speaking adults (aged [&ge;]18 years) were included in the final analysis. Convergent, discriminant, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were carried out. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach alpha.

ResultsAge of participants ranged between 18 to 73 years; 57.14% were females, 37.43% from Egypt, 36.86%, from UAE, and 30% were healthcare workers. The 5 sub-scales of the questionnaire met the criterion of internal consistency (Cronbach alpha [&ge;]0.7). Convergent validity was identified by the significant inter-item and item-total correlation (P<0.001). Discriminant validity was reported as inter-factor correlation matrix (<0.7). Exploratory factor analysis indicated that the 15 items of the questionnaire could be summarized into five factors. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed that the hypothesized five-factor model of the 15-item questionnaire was satisfied with adequate psychometric properties and fit with observed data (RMSEA=0.060,GFI=0.924, CFI=0.957, TLI=0.937, SRMR=0.076 & NFI=906).

Conclusionthe Arabic version of the 5C scale is a valid and reliable tool to assess the psychological antecedents of COVID-19 vaccine among Arab population.","Abd Elhafeez, S.; Shaaban, R.; Elbarazi, I.; Elmakhzangy, R.; Aly, M.

These included one with necrotizing leukoencephalopathy, one after recent PEA cardiac arrest without leukoencephalopathy, and one without frank encephalopathy or recent severe hypoxic episode. The MRSI findings were compared to those of two patients with white matter pathology not SARS-CoV2 infection related, and a control patient without clinical encephalopathy. The N-acetylaspartate reduction, choline elevation, and glutamate/glutamine elevation found in the COVID necrotizing leukoencephalopathy patient and, to a lesser degree, the COVID post-cardiac arrest patient, follow a similar pattern as seen with the delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy patient.

24364,A randomized controlled trial of a video intervention shows evidence of increasing COVID-19 vaccination intention,"Increasing acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines is imperative for public health, as unvaccinated individuals may impede the ability to reach herd immunity. Previous research on educational interventions to overcome vaccine hesitancy have shown mixed effects in increasing vaccination intention, although much of this work has focused on parental attitudes toward childhood vaccination. In this study, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to investigate whether vaccination intention changes after viewing an animated YouTube video explaining how COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work. We exposed participants to one of four interventions - watching the video with a male narrator, watching the same video with a female narrator, reading the text of the transcript of the video, or receiving no information (control group). We found that participants who watched the version of the video with a male narrator expressed statistically significant increased vaccination intention compared to the control group. The video with a female narrator had more variation in results. As a whole, there was a non-significant increased vaccination intention when analyzing all participants who saw the video with a female narrator; however, for politically conservative participants there was decreased vaccination intention for this intervention, particularly at a threshold between being currently undecided and expressing probable interest. These results are encouraging for the ability of interventions as simple as YouTube videos to increase vaccination propensity, although the inconsistent response to the video with a female narrator demonstrates the potential for bias to affect how certain groups respond to different messengers.

Significance StatementWidespread vaccination is important for ending the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigates whether communicating the science behind new COVID-19 vaccines can increase peoples willingness to get vaccinated. We examined the effectiveness of an eight-minute animated video explaining how COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work, varying between a male narrator, a female narrator, and a control group. Participants who saw the video with a male narrator expressed a greater intent to get vaccinated than the control group. Participants who saw the video with a female narrator had more varied responses, including a decreased intent to get vaccinated among political conservatives. These findings indicate that science education may help increase vaccine uptake, but that beliefs about gender may influence how people receive such information.","Witus, L.

21965,"Combination therapy of Tocilizumab and steroid for management of COVID-19 associated cytokine release syndrome: A single center experience from Pune, Western India","BackgroundCytokine release syndrome (CRS) or cytokine storm is thought to be the cause of inflammatory lung damage, worsening pneumonia and death in patients with COVID-19. Steroids (Methylprednisolone or Dexamethasone) and Tocilizumab (TCZ), an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, are approved for the treatment of CRS in India. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy of TCZ and steroids in COVID-19 associated CRS.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary level private hospital in Pune, India between 2nd April and 2nd November 2020. All patients administered TCZ and steroids for treatment of CRS were included. The primary endpoint was incidence of all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes studied were need for mechanical ventilation and incidence of infectious complications. Baseline and time-dependent risk factors significantly associated with death were identified by Relative risk estimation.

ResultsOut of 2831 admitted patients, 515 (24.3% females) were administered TCZ and steroids. Median age of the cohort was 57 (IQR: 46.5, 66) years. Almost 72 % patients had preexisting co-morbidities. Median time to TCZ administration since onset of symptoms was 9 days (IQR: 7, 11). 63% patients needed intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Mechanical ventilation was required in 242 (47%) patients. Of these, 44.2% (107/242) recovered and were weaned off the ventilator. There were 135 deaths (26.2%), while 380 patients (73.8%) had clinical improvement. Infectious complications like hospital acquired pneumonia, bloodstream bacterial and fungal infections were observed in 2.13 %, 2.13 % and 0.06 % patients respectively. Age [&ge;] 60 years (p=0.014), presence of co-morbidities like hypertension (p = 0.011), IL-6 [&ge;] 100 pg/ml (p = 0.002), D-dimer [&ge;] 1000 ng/ml (p < 0.0001), CT severity index [&ge;] 18 (p < 0.0001) and systemic complications like lung fibrosis (p = 0.019), cardiac arrhythmia (p < 0.0001), hypotension (p < 0.0001) and encephalopathy (p < 0.0001) were associated with increased risk of death.

ConclusionsCombination therapy of TCZ and Steroids is likely to be safe and effective in the management of COVID-19 associated cytokine release syndrome.

2436,Diagnosis of Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection by Detection of Nucleocapsid Protein,"BACKGROUNDNucleic acid test and antibody assay have been employed in the diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the use of viral antigen for diagnosis has not been successfully developed. Theoretically, viral antigen is the specific marker of the virus and precedes antibody appearance within the infected population. There is a clear need of detection of viral antigen for rapid and early diagnosis.

METHODSWe included a cohort of 239 participants with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from 7 centers for the study. We measured nucleocapsid protein in nasopharyngeal swab samples in parallel with the nucleic acid test. Nucleic acid test was taken as the reference standard, and statistical evaluation was taken in blind. We detected nucleocapsid protein in 20 urine samples in another center, employing nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test as reference standard.

RESULTSWe developed a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay for detecting nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab sample and urine within 10 minutes. 100% of nucleocapsid protein positive and negative participants accord with nucleic acid test for same samples. Further, earliest participant after 3 days of fever can be identified by the method. In an additional preliminary study, we detected nucleocapsid protein in urine in 73.6% of diagnosed COVID-19 patients.

CONCLUSIONSThose findings indicate that nucleocapsid protein assay is an accurate, rapid, early and simple method for diagnosis of COVID-19. Appearance of nucleocapsid protein in urine coincides our finding of the SARS-CoV-2 invading kidney and might be of diagnostic value.","Diao, B.; Wen, K.; Chen, J.; Liu, Y.; Yuan, Z.; Han, C.; Chen, J.; Pan, Y.; Chen, L.; Dan, Y.; Wang, J.; Chen, Y.; Deng, G.; Zhou, H.; Wu, Y.",2020-03-13,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.07.20032524,2,Yuzhang Wu,"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University,Chongqing,People\'s Republic of China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.07.20032524v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.07.20032524v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
2921,Screening and managing of suspected or confirmed novel coronavirus (COVID-19) patients: experiences from a tertiary hospital outside Hubei province,"ObjectivesTo report our experiences screening and managing patients with suspected or confirmed novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease using a hospital-specific protocol.

DesignLongitudinal cohort study.

SettingA 1,200 bed tertiary care teaching hospital in Chengdu, Sichuan, China.

Participants802 adults presenting to hospital with concerns of having COVID-19, 1,246 inpatients and 2,531 hospital visitors.

InterventionsScreening and management of patients using a hospital-specific protocol, which included fever triage, monitoring visitors and patients, emergency response, personnel training for healthcare team members, health education for patients and family, medical materials management, disinfection and wastes disposal protocols.

ResultsBetween 23 January and 28 February 2020, 73 people were identified as having fever plus respiratory signs with/without a history of exposure and were tested for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by our hospital lab using RT PCR. Forty-five of these 73 people were subsequently excluded based on one negative RT PCR result plus positive results to quick screening tests for flu or other respiratory viruses. The remaining 28 people received a second RT PCR test 24 h later. Three people were confirmed positive for COVID-19 based on two consecutive positive RT PCR tests whilst 25 people were excluded based on two consecutive negative tests. The three COVID-19 confirmed cases received non-critical care. There were no new infections of medical staff or new infections of other hospital inpatients.

ConclusionsA hospital-specific protocol for screening and management is necessary for reliably identifying suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during an outbreak. All three cases were detected as a result of vigilant monitoring of hospital visitors. Whilst screening out-patients presenting to a fever clinic remains important, monitoring visitors must not be overlooked.

Strengths and limitations of this study{blacktriangleright} We report a hospital-specific protocol used to screen and manage people presenting to our hospital fever clinic, inpatients and visitors during an outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia in Chengdu, Sichuan province.
{blacktriangleright}Key components of the protocol included: a three-level fever triage process; monitoring visitors and inpatients, formation of an emergency response team for COVID-19, personnel training for healthcare team members, health education for patients and family, medical materials management, and disinfection and wastes disposal protocols.
{blacktriangleright}The ability to test nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 using RT PCR in the hospital greatly shortened the time from the detection of patients to diagnosis, and was beneficial to the control of the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2.
{blacktriangleright}Although our process detected few patients, comparison with other processes, when they are published, will allow the identification of the optimal approach for screening and management.
{blacktriangleright}We suggest that if all resources had been focused on screening people through our fever clinic, we would have missed important in-hospital risks of transmitting COVID-19: The detection of a hospital visitor with COVID-19 led to the detection of an inpatient with COVID-19.","Pu, H.; Xu, Y.; Doig, G.

5045,Measure what matters: counts of hospitalized patients are a better metric for health system capacity planning for a reopening,"Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic requires accurate forecasting of health system capacity requirements using readily available inputs. We examined whether testing and hospitalization data could help quantify the anticipated burden on the health system given shelter-in-place (SIP) order.

We find a marked slowdown in the hospitalization rate within ten days of SIP even as cases continued to rise. We also find a shift towards younger patients in the age distribution of those testing positive for COVID-19 over the four weeks of SIP. The impact of this shift is a divergence between increasing positive case confirmations and slowing new hospitalizations, both of which affects the demand on health systems.

Without using local hospitalization rates and the age distribution of positive patients, current models are likely to overestimate the resource burden of COVID-19. It is imperative that health systems start using these data to quantify effects of SIP and aid reopening planning.","Kashyap, S.; Gombar, S.; Yadlowsky, S.; Callahan, A.; Fries, J.; Pinsky, B.

22336,Evaluation of a fully automated high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 multiplex qPCR assay with build-in screening functionality for DelHV69/70- and N501Y variants such as B.1.1.7,"1BackgroundNew SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased transmissibility, like B.1.1.7 from England or B1.351 from South Africa, have caused considerable concern worldwide. In order to contain the spread of these lineages, it is of utmost importance to have rapid, sensitive and high-throughput detection methods at hand.

MethodsAnalytical sensitivity was assessed for both wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.1.7 lineage by serial dilution. A total of 141 clinical samples were subjected to the test and results compared to a commercial manual typing-PCR assay and NGS.

ResultsThe multiplex assay is highly sensitive for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples, with an LoD of 25.82 cp/ml (CI: 11.61 - 57.48). LoDs are slightly higher for the HV68/70 deletion (111.36 cp/ml; CI: 78.16 - 158.67) and the N501Y SNP (2548.04 cp/ml, CI: 1592.58 - 4076.73). A total of 141 clinical samples were tested with the assay, including 16 samples containing SARS-CoV-2 of the B.1.1.7 lineage. Three non-B.1.1.7 samples contained a HV69/70 deletion. All were correctly identified by the multiplex assay.

ConclusionWe describe here a highly sensitive, fully automated multiplex PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of del-HV69/70 and N501Y that can distinguish between lineages B.1.1.7 and B1.351. The assay allows for high-throughput screening for relevant variants in clinical samples prior to sequencing.","Nörz, D.; Grunwald, M.; Olearo, F.; Fischer, N.; Aepfelbacher, M.; Pfefferle, S.; Lütgehetmann, M.",2021-02-18,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.02.12.21251614,1,Dominik Nörz,University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.12.21251614v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.12.21251614v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
13432,Local protection bubbles: an interpretation of the decrease in the velocity of coronavirus's spread in the city of Sao Paulo,"After four months of dealing with the pandemic, the city of Sao Paulo entered a phase of relaxed social-distancing measures in July 2020, and saw its social isolation rate fall at the same time as the number of cases, deaths, and hospital bed occupation declined. We use a calibrated multi-agent model to describe these dynamics. We assert here that this phenomenon can be understood as the result of local protective bubbles formed in the citys sub-environments at the same time that there was an exhaustion of contagion networks. Both reduce the velocity of the viruss spread, causing temporary reductions in the epidemic curve, albeit in an unstable equilibrium. These local bubbles can burst anytime and anywhere due to the reintroduction of a few infected people at the same time that there is a reduction in non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), such as social-distancing practices. It is important to stress that this hypothesis aligns with the dynamics of the viruss spread observed so far, without needing ad hoc suppositions about natural collective immunity thresholds or heterogeneity in the populations transmission rate, which come with the risk of making mistaken predictions that may could lead to the loss of many lives. The safe way to move ahead is to continue doing all we can to avoid new infections until a vaccine is found that properly and safely creates herd immunity.","Pinto, J. P. G.; Magalhaes, P.

19657,Risk-driven responses to COVID-19 eliminate the tradeoff between lives and livelihoods,"Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have been conditioned by a perceived tradeoff between saving lives and the economic costs of contact-reduction measures. We develop a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission where populations endogenously reduce contacts in response to the risk of death. We estimate the model for 118 countries and assess the existence of a tradeoff between death rates and changes in contacts. In this model communities go through three phases - rapid early outbreaks, control through initial response, and a longer period of quasi-equilibrium endemic infection with effective reproduction number (Re) fluctuating around one. Analytical characterization of this phase shows little tradeoff between contact reduction levels (underpinning economic costs) and death rates. Empirically estimating the model, we find no positive correlation between (log) death rates and (normalized) contact levels across nations, whether contacts are estimated based on epidemic curves or mobility data. While contact reduction levels are broadly similar across countries, expected death rates vary greatly, by two orders of magnitude (5-95 percentile: 0.03-17 deaths per million per day). Results suggest nations could significantly reduce the human toll of the pandemic without more disruption to normal social and economic activity than they have already faced.

Executive SummaryO_LIProblem specification: The response to COVID-19 pandemic is dominated by a perceived tradeoff between saving lives through cutting social interactions vs. allowing those interactions to maintain economic livelihood of communities. It is, however, unclear if this tradeoff really exists.
C_LIO_LIPractitioner audience: Local, regional, and national policy makers who control communities responses to observed levels of COVID-19 transmission risk are grappling with this perceived tradeoff on a daily basis.
C_LIO_LICore insight: The perceived tradeoff is illusory. Every community will pay a similar price in contact reduction. What communities do control is the level of infection and deaths at which they are willing to bring down contacts enough to keep the epidemic from growing further.
C_LIO_LIPractical implications: By becoming more responsive, effective leaders quickly bring down communitys interactions in response to small numbers of cases and deaths. They can then maintain these small case counts at social interaction levels similar to other communities that experience much larger ongoing cases. Thus, there is a path to saving lives at limited excess costs.

Here, we examined the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in 1808 asymptomatic individuals on a university campus in California, and compared for the first time the performance of CRISPR- and PCR-based assays for large-scale virus surveillance. Our study revealed that there were no COVID-19 cases in our study population in May/June of 2020. Using the same methods, we demonstrated a substantial shift in prevalence approximately one month later, which coincided with changes in community restrictions and public interactions. This increase in prevalence, in a young and asymptomatic population, indicated the leading wave of a local outbreak, and reflected the rising case counts in the surrounding county. Our results substantiate that large, population-level asymptomatic screening using CRISPR- or PCR-based assays is a feasible and instructive aspect of the public health approach within large campus communities.","Rauch, J.

However, COVID-19 is spreading in different rates at different countries. Here, we tested the effect of three classes of predictors, i.e., socioeconomic, climatic and transport, on the rate of daily increase of COVID-19. We found that global connections, represented by countries importance in the global air transportation network, is the main explanation for the growth rate of COVID-19 in different countries. Climate, geographic distance and socioeconomics had a milder effect in this big picture analysis. Geographic distance and climate were significant barriers in the past but were surpassed by the human engine that allowed us to colonize most of our planet land surface. Our results indicate that the current claims that the growth rate of COVID-19 may be lower in warmer and humid tropical countries should be taken very carefully, at risk to disturb well-established and effective policy of social isolation that may help to avoid higher mortality rates due to the collapse of national health systems.","Coelho, M.

20980,A Serology Strategy for Epidemiological Studies Based on the Comparison of the Performance of Seven Different Test Systems - The Representative COVID-19 Cohort Munich,"BackgroundSerosurveys are essential to understand SARS-CoV-2 exposure and enable population-level surveillance, but currently available tests need further in-depth evaluation. We aimed to identify testing-strategies by comparing seven seroassays in a population-based cohort.

MethodsWe analysed 6,658 samples consisting of true-positives (n=193), true-negatives (n=1,091), and specimens of unknown status (n=5,374). For primary testing, we used Euroimmun-Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA-IgA/IgG and Roche-Elecsys-Anti-SARS-CoV-2; and virus-neutralisation, GeneScript(R)cPass, VIRAMED-SARS-CoV-2-ViraChip(R), and Mikrogen-recomLine-SARS-CoV-2-IgG, including common-cold CoVs, for confirmatory testing. Statistical modelling generated optimised assay cut-off-thresholds.

FindingsSensitivity of Euroimmun-anti-S1-IgA was 64.8%, specificity 93.3%; for Euroimmun-anti-S1-IgG, sensitivity was 77.2/79.8% (manufacturers/optimised cut-offs), specificity 98.0/97.8%; Roche-anti-N sensitivity was 85.5/88.6%, specificity 99.8/99.7%. In true-positives, mean and median titres remained stable for at least 90-120 days after RT-PCR-positivity. Of true-positives with positive RT-PCR (<30 days), 6.7% did not mount detectable seroresponses. Virus-neutralisation was 73.8% sensitive, 100.0% specific (1:10 dilution). Neutralisation surrogate tests (GeneScript(R)cPass, Mikrogen-recomLine-RBD) were >94.9% sensitive, >98.1% specific. Seasonality had limited effects; cross-reactivity with common-cold CoVs 229E and NL63 in SARS-CoV-2 true-positives was significant.

ConclusionOptimised cut-offs improved test performances of several tests. Non-reactive serology in true-positives was uncommon. For epidemiological purposes, confirmatory testing with virus-neutralisation may be replaced with GeneScript(R)cPass or recomLine-RBD. Head-to-head comparisons given here aim to contribute to the refinement of testing-strategies for individual and public health use.","Olbrich, L.; Castelletti, N.; Schaelte, Y.; Gari, M.; Puetz, P.; Bakuli, A.; Pritsch, M.; Kroidl, I.; Saathoff, E.; Guggenbuehl Noller, J.

19675,Mathematical assessment of the roles of vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 dynamics: a multigroup modeling approach,"A novel coronavirus emerged in December of 2019 (COVID-19), causing a pandemic that continues to inflict unprecedented public health and economic burden in all nooks and corners of the world. Although the control of COVID-19 has largely focused on the use of basic public health measures (primarily based on using non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as quarantine, isolation, social-distancing, face mask usage and community lockdowns), a number of exceptionally-promising vaccines are about to be approved for use in humans by the U.S. Food and Drugs Administration. We present a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of the candidate vaccines, particularly for the case where the vaccination program is complemented with a social-distancing control measure at a certain compliance level. The model stratifies the total population into two subgroups, based on whether or not they habitually wear face mask in public. The resulting multigroup model, which takes the form of a compartmental, deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, is parametrized using COVID-19 cumulative mortality data. Conditions for the asymptotic stability of the associated disease-free equilibrium, as well as expression for the vaccine-derived herd immunity threshold, are derived. This study shows that the prospect of COVID-19 elimination using any of the three candidate vaccines is quite promising, and that such elimination is more feasible if the vaccination program is combined with social-distancing control measures (implemented at moderate to high level of compliance).","Gumel, A.

From the perspectives of information and mobility, this work aims at evaluating to what degree the massive population has responded to the emergencies of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Using the real-time and historical data collected from the Baidu Maps and Baidu search engines, we confirm the strong correlation between the local pandemic situation in every major Chinese city and the population inflows from Wuhan between 1 January and 23 January 2020. We further evidence that, in cities under more critical situations, people are likely to engage COVID-19-related searches more frequently, while they are not likely to escape from the cities. Finally, the correlation analysis using search and mobility data shows that well-informed individuals are likely to travel less, even while the overall travel demands are low compared to the historical records. Partial correlation analysis has been conducted to test the significance of these observations with respect to other controlling factors.","Xiong, H.; Liu, J.; Huang, J.; Huang, S.; An, H.; Kang, Q.; Li, Y.; Dou, D.; Wang, H.",2020-05-22,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.20.20068676,3,Dejing Dou,Baidu Inc.,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.20068676v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.20068676v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
10169,Estimation of fatality rate in Africa through the behavior of COVID-19 in Italy relevance to age profiles,"The emergence and pandemic of COVID-19 has rapidly become a global concern. In Italy, on 27 March 2020, there were 8165 deaths and 80539 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Demographic situations, like age profiles is reported to be the cause of high case fatality rate (CFR) in Italy. In Africa, the COVID-19 pandemic has not yet grasped epic proportion, but the estimation of CFR is still needed. We compared the CFR observed in Italy with the age profiles in 46 Africa countries and 2 territories which are already confirmed COVID-19 case. The estimation of the CFR in Africa ranges between (1.0%-5.4%) while in Italy is 10.1%. The five highest CFR countries and territories in Africa are Reunion (5.4%), Mauritius (5.1%), Tunisia (3.9%), Seychelles (3.8%) and Morocco (3.3%). The last three countries with low CFR are Uganda (1.0%), Zambia (1.1%) and Angola (1.1%). The observed difference is related to the age profiles.","Lambert, N.; Umuhoza, D.; Dai, Y.; A E.

13098,"Wrong person, place and time: viral load and contact network structure predict SARS-CoV-2 transmission and super-spreading events","SARS-CoV-2 is difficult to contain because many transmissions occur during the pre-symptomatic phase of infection. Moreover, in contrast to influenza, while most SARS-CoV-2 infected people do not transmit the virus to anybody, a small percentage secondarily infect large numbers of people. We designed mathematical models of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza which link observed viral shedding patterns with key epidemiologic features of each virus, including distributions of the number of secondary cases attributed to each infected person (individual R0) and the duration between symptom onset in the transmitter and secondarily infected person (serial interval). We identify that people with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza infections are usually contagious for fewer than one day congruent with peak viral load several days after infection, and that transmission is unlikely below a certain viral load. SARS-CoV-2 super-spreader events with over 10 secondary infections occur when an infected person is briefly shedding at a very high viral load and has a high concurrent number of exposed contacts. The higher predisposition of SARS-CoV-2 towards super-spreading events is not due to its 1-2 additional weeks of viral shedding relative to influenza. Rather, a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 exposes more people within equivalent physical contact networks than a person infected with influenza, likely due to aerosolization of virus. Our results support policies that limit crowd size in indoor spaces and provide viral load benchmarks for infection control and therapeutic interventions intended to prevent secondary transmission.

One Sentence SummaryWe developed a coupled within-host and between-host mathematical model to identify viral shedding levels required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, and to explain why super-spreading events occur more commonly during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Goyal, A.; Reeves, D.

18499,Multicenter evaluation of the Panbio COVID-19 Rapid Antigen-Detection Test for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection,"The standard RT-PCR assay for COVID-19 is laborious and time-consuming, limiting the availability of testing. Rapid antigen-detection tests are faster and less expensive; however, the reliability of these tests must be validated before they can be used widely. The objective of this study was to determine the reliability of the PanbioTM COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (PanbioRT) (Abbott) for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab specimens. This was a prospective multicenter study in ten Spanish university hospitals of patients from hospital units with clinical symptoms or epidemiological criteria for COVID-19. Patients whose onset of symptoms or exposure was more than 7 days earlier were excluded. Two nasopharyngeal exudate samples were taken to perform the PanbioRT and a diagnostic RT-PCR test. Among the 958 patients studied, 359 (37.5%) were positive by RT-PCR and 325 (33.9%) were also positive by the PanbioRT. Agreement was 95.7% (kappa score: 0.90). All 34 false-negative PanbioRT results were in symptomatic patients, with 23.5% of them at 6-7 days since the onset of symptoms and 58.8% presenting CT >30 values for RT-PCR, indicating a low viral load. Overall sensitivity and specificity for the PanbioRT were 90.5% and 98.8%, respectively. The PanbioRT provides good clinical performance as a point-of-care test, with even more reliable results for patients with a shorter clinical course of the disease or a higher viral load. While this study has had a direct impact on the national diagnostic strategy for COVID-19 in Spain, the results must be interpreted based on the local epidemiological context.","Merino-Amador, P.; Guinea, J.; Munoz-Gallego, I.; Gonzalez-Donapetry, P.; Galan, J.

4339,Household Secondary Attack Rate of COVID-19 and Associated Determinants,"BackgroundAs of April 2, 2020, the global reported number of COVID-19 cases has crossed over 1 million with more than 55,000 deaths. The household transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen, remains elusive.

MethodsBased on a comprehensive contact-tracing dataset from Guangzhou, we estimated both the population-level effective reproductive number and individual-level secondary attack rate (SAR) in the household setting. We assessed age effects on transmissibility and the infectivity of COVID-19 cases during their incubation period.

ResultsA total of 195 unrelated clusters with 212 primary cases, 137 nonprimary (secondary or tertiary) cases and 1938 uninfected close contacts were traced. We estimated the household SAR to be 13.8% (95% CI: 11.1-17.0%) if household contacts are defined as all close relatives and 19.3% (95% CI: 15.5-23.9%) if household contacts only include those at the same residential address as the cases, assuming a mean incubation period of 4 days and a maximum infectious period of 13 days. The odds of infection among children (<20 years old) was only 0.26 (95% CI: 0.13-0.54) times of that among the elderly ([&ge;]60 years old). There was no gender difference in the risk of infection. COVID-19 cases were at least as infectious during their incubation period as during their illness. On average, a COVID-19 case infected 0.48 (95% CI: 0.39-0.58) close contacts. Had isolation not been implemented, this number increases to 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51-0.75). The effective reproductive number in Guangzhou dropped from above 1 to below 0.5 in about 1 week.

ConclusionSARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible in households than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the elderly [&ge;]60 years old are the most vulnerable to household transmission. Case finding and isolation alone may be inadequate to contain the pandemic and need to be used in conjunction with heightened restriction of human movement as implemented in Guangzhou.","Jing, Q.-L.; Liu, M.-J.; Yuan, J.; Zhang, Z.-B.; Zhang, A.-R.; Dean, N.

4606,CoroNet: A Deep Network Architecture for Semi-Supervised Task-Based Identification of COVID-19 from Chest X-ray Images,"In late 2019, a new Coronavirus disease, referred to as Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged in Wuhan city, Hubei, China, and resulted in a global pandemic--claiming a large number of lives and affecting billions all around the world. The current global standard used in diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected cases is the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Although the RT-PCR remains the standard reference for diagnosis purposes, it is a time-consuming and expensive test, and moreover, it usually suffers from high rates of false-negatives. Several early works have reported that the sensitivity of the chest Computed Tomography (CT) and the chest X-ray imaging are noticeably greater than that of the RT-PCR test at the initial representations of the disease, making them great candidates for developing new and sophisticated methodologies for analysis and classification of COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we establish the use of a rapid, non-invasive and cost-effective X-ray-based method as a key diagnosis and screening tool for COVID-19 at early and intermediate stages of the disease. To this end, we develop a novel and sophisticated deep learning-based signal and image processing technique as well as classification methodology for analyzing X-ray images specific to COVID-19 disease. Specifically, we consider a semi-supervised learning methodology based on AutoEncoders to first extract the infected legions in chest X-ray manifestation of COVID-19 and other Pneumonia-like diseases (as well as healthy cases). Then, we utilize this highly-tailored deep architecture to extract the relevant features specific to each class (i.e., healthy, non-COVID pneumonia, and COVID-19) and train a powerful yet efficient classifier to perform the task of automatic diagnosis. Furthermore, the semi-supervised nature of the proposed framework enables us to efficiently exploit the limited available dataset on COVID-19 while exploiting the vast amount of available X-ray dataset for healthy and non-COVID classes. Moreover, such a semi-supervised approach does not require an expert-annotated lesion area for each class. Our numerical investigations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for COVID-19 identification while employing approximately ten times fewer training parameters as compared to other existing methodologies for classification of the COVID-19 from X-ray images (facilitating efficient training in a limited data regime). We further develop explainable artificial intelligence tools that can explain the diagnosis by using attribution maps while providing an indispensable tool for the radiologist in triage state. We have made the codes of our proposed framework publicly available to the research and healthcare community1.","Khobahi, S.; Agarwal, C.; Soltanalian, M.",2020-04-17,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.14.20065722,1,Shahin Khobahi,University of Illinois at Chicago,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20065722v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20065722v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA

The virus is named as SARS-CoV-2. In this situation, rational decisions need to be made on how the care is provided for patients with COVID-19. The Incidence report, general symptoms and readily available testing kits, different control strategies, the basic compartmental model, and some of the current research on the epidemiology of the disease are discussed and previously published models are reviewed. Modeling this disease helps in understanding the spread, and predict its future to evaluate different control strategies (Social Distancing, Contact Tracing and Hospitalization). Compartmental modeling framework is used in this work. The non-linear equations are formulated and fitted to the cumulative case and mortality data. Analytical analysis along with uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis is performed, and the conditions to achieve disease free equilibrium is evaluated. Finally, Different control strategies are simulated to show their importance. This paper aims to shows the advantage of mathematical modeling and their simulations in times like now, during which the COVID-19 spreading like wildfire.

24863,Real-world Effect of Monoclonal Antibody Treatment in COVID-19 Patients in a Diverse Population in the United States,"BackgroundMonoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 are a promising treatment for limiting the progression of COVID-19 and decreasing strain on hospitals. Their use, however, remains limited, particularly in disadvantaged populations.

MethodsElectronic health records were reviewed from SARS-CoV-2 patients at a single medical center in the United States that initiated mAb infusions in January 2021 with the support of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services National Disaster Medical System. Patients who received mAbs were compared to untreated patients from the time period before mAb availability who met eligibility criteria for mAb treatment. We used logistic regression to measure the effect of mAb treatment on the risk of hospitalization or emergency department (E.D.) visit within 30 days of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.

ResultsOf 598 COVID-19 patients, 270 (45%) received bamlanivimab and 328 (55%) were untreated. Two hundred and thirty-one patients (39%) were Hispanic. Among treated patients, 5/270 (1.9%) presented to the E.D. or required hospitalization within 30 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, compared to 39/328 (12%) untreated patients (p<0.001). After adjusting for age, gender, and comorbidities, the risk of E.D. visit or hospitalization was 82% lower in mAb-treated patients compared to untreated patients (95% confidence interval [CI]: 66%-94%).

ConclusionsIn this diverse, real-world COVID-19 patient population, mAb treatment significantly decreased the risk of subsequent E.D. visit or hospitalization. Broader treatment with mAbs, including in disadvantaged patient populations, can decrease the burden on hospitals and should be facilitated in all populations in the United States to ensure health equity.

2179,A machine learning-based model for survival prediction in patients with severe COVID-19 infection,"The sudden increase of COVID-19 cases is putting a high pressure on healthcare services worldwide. At the current stage, fast, accurate and early clinical assessment of the disease severity is vital. To support decision making and logistical planning in healthcare systems, this study leverages a database of blood samples from 404 infected patients in the region of Wuhan, China to identify crucial predictive biomarkers of disease severity. For this purpose, machine learning tools selected three biomarkers that predict the survival of individual patients with more than 90% accuracy: lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). In particular, relatively high levels of LDH alone seem to play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention. This finding is consistent with current medical knowledge that high LDH levels are associated with tissue breakdown occurring in various diseases, including pulmonary disorders such as pneumonia. Overall, this paper suggests a simple and operable formula to quickly predict patients at the highest risk, allowing them to be prioritised and potentially reducing the mortality rate.

3393,Analytical sensitivity and efficiency comparisons of SARS-COV-2 qRT-PCR primer-probe sets,"The recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exemplifies the critical need for accurate and rapid diagnostic assays to prompt clinical and public health interventions. Currently, several quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays are being used by clinical, research, and public health laboratories. However, it is currently unclear if results from different tests are comparable. Our goal was to evaluate the primer-probe sets used in four common diagnostic assays available on the World Health Organization (WHO) website. To facilitate this effort, we generated RNA transcripts to be used as assay standards and distributed them to other laboratories for internal validation. We then used (1) RNA transcript standards, (2) full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA, (3) pre-COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swabs, and (4) clinical samples from COVID-19 patients to determine analytical efficiency and sensitivity of the qRT-PCR primer-probe sets. We show that all primer-probe sets can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 at 500 virus copies per reaction, except for the RdRp-SARSr (Charite) confirmatory primer-probe set which has low sensitivity. Our findings characterize the limitations of currently used primer-probe sets and can assist other laboratories in selecting appropriate assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.","Vogels, C. B.

13026,Clinical Mortality Review in a Large COVID-19 Cohort,"BackgroundNorthwell Health (Northwell), an integrated health system in New York, treated more than 15000 inpatients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at the US epicenter of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. We describe the demographic characteristics of COVID-19 mortalities, observation of frequent rapid response teams (RRT)/cardiac arrest (CA) calls for non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and factors that contributed to RRT/CA calls.

MethodsA team of registered nurses reviewed medical records of inpatients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) before or on admission and died between March 13 (first Northwell inpatient expiration) and April 30, 2020 at 15 Northwell hospitals. Findings for these patients were abstracted into a database and statistically analyzed.

FindingsOf 2634 COVID-19 mortalities, 56.1% had oxygen saturation levels greater than or equal to 90% on presentation and required no respiratory support. At least one RRT/CA was called on 42.2% of patients at a non-ICU level of care. Before the RRT/CA call, the most recent oxygen saturation levels for 76.6% of non-ICU patients were at least 90%. At the time RRT/CA was called, 43.1% had an oxygen saturation less than 80%.

InterpretationThis study represents one of the largest cohorts of reviewed mortalities that also captures data in non-structured fields. Approximately 50% of deaths occurred at a non-ICU level of care, despite admission to the appropriate care setting with normal staffing. The data imply a sudden, unexpected deterioration in respiratory status requiring RRT/CA in a large number of non-ICU patients. Patients admitted to a non-ICU level of care suffer rapid clinical deterioration, often with a sudden decrease in oxygen saturation. These patients could benefit from additional monitoring (eg, continuous central oxygenation saturation), although this approach warrants further study.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSThe world first learned of SARS-CoV-2 through a landmark study published by the Lancet in January 2020. Early evidence was limited due to the novel nature of the virus, clinician inexperience in treating COVID-19, small sample size of primarily hospital inpatients in early observational studies, use of structured datasets for data collection, and early and evolving treatment guidelines. We collected evidence from leading medical journals from January 2020 through June 2020 that primarily describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 (eg, patient age, sex, and comorbidities) as well as the different approaches to treatment that were being used. Our search consisted of real-time publications as they became available. Analyzing the characteristics of patients who died can help to define the clinical nature of COVID-19 and potentially suggest new care protocols.

Added value of this studyUnlike prior research, our study represents one of the largest cohorts of COVID-19 mortalities abstracted from both structured and unstructured fields in the medical record using data collected during the surge of infections in the New York metropolitan area in March through April 2020. Our study identified an unusual pattern of respiratory decompensation in patients who presented to the hospital with acceptable oxygen saturation levels and were therefore admitted to a non-ICU setting for care. Through our unique analysis, we identified a cohort of patients who experienced a rapid response team/cardiac arrest call after a sudden and unexpected decrease in their oxygenation saturation levels.

Implications of available evidenceOur findings, based on over 2600 inpatient mortalities, suggest that there is a subpopulation of patients who are admitted to a non-ICU setting where continuous oxygenation saturation monitoring is not a standard, but may be warranted. Further research is needed to understand which patients are at highest risk for mortality, due to age and comorbidities, and the implications of continuous monitoring on mortality rates. This finding is relevant to a wide audience of national and international health care providers.","Jarrett, M. P.; Schultz, S. F.; Lyall, J. S.; Wang, J. J.; Stier, L.; De Geronimo, M.; Nelson, K.

4202,Relationship between Average Daily Temperature and Average Cumulative Daily Rate of Confirmed Cases of COVID-19,"AIMSThe main purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between the average daily temperature and the rate of coronavirus epidemic growth in the infected regions.

BACKGROUNDThe rapid outbreak of the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the spread of the virus worldwide, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, have prompted various investigations about the impact of environmental factors on the rate of development of this epidemic. Different studies have called attention to various parameters that may have influenced the spread of the virus, and in particular, the impact of climatic parameters has been emphasized.

OBJECTIVEThe main hypothesis object of our research is that between regions exhibiting a significant difference in the mean daily temperature, a significant difference is also observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases and that this does not happen if there is no significant difference in mean daily temperature.

METHODThe research hypothesis was investigated through statistical analysis. The F-test was used to test whether there is significant equality of variances for each pair of case studies, and then, by the T- Test, the existence of a significant difference was investigated. In all statistical tests, the confidence level of 95% is considered. In order to minimize the impact on the results of factors like the policy of the government or cultural differences among countries (food, exercise, weight, etc.), three case studies within five countries, namely Iran, Italy, Germany, Spain, and United States were compared separately.

RESULTThis statistical analysis shows that there is a correlation between the average temperature and the epidemic rate, and this is especially evident when differences in average daily temperature are significantly larger, as it happens for Bandar Abbas in Iran, Milan in Italy, Santa Cruz in Spain, and Los Angeles in the US. Besides, the analysis of the average air temperatures shows that the epidemic rates of COVID-19 were higher in the case studies with a lower average temperature. Instead, when no significant differences exist in the average daily temperature of two cities in the same country, there is no significant difference in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases.

CONCLUSIONIn all five selected countries, we found that when there is a significant difference in the daily mean temperature between two regions of a country, a significant difference also exists in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases. Conversely, if there are no significant differences in the mean daily temperature of two regions in the same country, no significant difference is observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases for these regions. In conclusion, the results of this study support the research hypothesis and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method for analysis of the epidemic rates.","Pirouz, B.; Golmohammadi, A.; Saeidpour Masouleh, H.; Violini, G.; Pirouz, B.",2020-07-23,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.10.20059337,3,Behzad Pirouz,"Department of Computer Engineering, Modelling, Electronics and Systems Engineering, University of Calabria",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20059337v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20059337v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
13069,CoMix: comparing mixing patterns in the Belgian population during and after lockdown,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has shown how a newly emergent communicable disease can lay considerable burden on public health. To avoid system collapse, governments have resorted to several social distancing measures. In Belgium, this included a lockdown and a following period of phased re-opening.

MethodsA representative sample of Belgian adults was asked about their contact behaviour from mid-April to mid-July, during different stages of the intervention measures in Belgium. Use of personal protection equipment (face masks) and compliance to hygienic measures was also reported. We estimated the expected reproduction number computing the ratio of R0 with respect to pre-pandemic data.

FindingsDuring the first two waves (the first month) of the survey, the reduction in the average number of contacts was around 80% and was quite consistent across all age-classes. The average number of contacts increased over time, particularly for the younger age classes, still remaining significantly lower than pre-pandemic values. Since the end of May, the estimated reproduction number has a median value larger than one, although with a wide dispersion.

ConclusionsWe have shown how a rapidly deployed survey can measure compliance to social distancing and assess its impact on COVID-19 spread. Monitoring the effectiveness of social distancing recommendations is of paramount importance to avoid further waves of COVID-19.","Coletti, P.; Wambua, J.; Gimma, A.; Willem, L.; Vercruysse, S.; Vanhoutte, B.; Jarvis, C.

17128,Frailty and comorbidity in predicting community COVID-19 mortality in the UK Biobank: the effect of sampling,"Frailty has been linked to increased risk of COVID-19 mortality, but evidence is mainly limited to hospitalized older individuals and analyses in community samples are scarce. This study aims to assess and compare the predictive abilities of different frailty measures - the frailty phenotype (FP), frailty index (FI), and Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), and comorbidity, measured using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), on COVID-19 mortality in a UK community sample of adults aged 52-86 years. We analyzed (i) the full sample of 428,754 UK Biobank participants and (ii) a subsample of 2,287 COVID-19 positive UK Biobank participants with data on COVID-19 outcomes between March 1 and September 21, 2020. COVID-19 positivity was confirmed by PCR, hospital records and/or death registers. Logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, smoking, ethnicity, and socioeconomic variables with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were used in the modelling. Overall, 391 individuals died of COVID-19. In the full sample, all frailty measures and the CCI were associated with COVID-19 mortality but only the HFRS and CCI improved the predictive ability of a model including age and sex, yielding AUCs>0.80. However, when restricting analyses to the COVID-19 positive subsample, which had an over-representation of frail individuals, similar improvement in AUCs was not observed in which only the CCI was significantly associated with COVID-19 mortality. Our results suggest that HFRS and CCI can be used in COVID-19 mortality risk stratification at the population level, but they show limited added value in COVID-19 positive individuals.","Mak, J. K.

23744,Estimating the increased transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 strain over previously circulating strains in England using frequencies of GISAID sequences and the distribution of serial intervals,"The B.1.1.7 strain, a variant strain of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is thought to have higher transmissibility than previously circulating strains in England. This paper proposes a method to estimate the selective advantage of a mutant strain over previously circulating strains using the time course of B.1.1.7 strain frequencies and the distribution of serial intervals. The method allows instantaneous reproduction numbers of infections to change during the target period of analysis. The proposed method, instead, assumes that the selective advantage of a mutant strain over previously circulating strains is constant over time. Applying this method to the sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 in England, the instantaneous reproduction number of the B.1.1.7 strain is estimated to be 33.7% (with a 95% confidence interval (CI) from 33.6% to 33.9%) higher than previously circulating strains in England, assuming that serial intervals of COVID-19 follow a lognormal distribution with a mean of 4.7 days and a standard deviation of 2.9 days. The result indicated that the control measure against B.1.1.7 strain needs to be strengthened by 33.7% from that against previously circulating strains. To get the same control effect as before, contact rates between individuals needed to be restricted to 0.748 of the contact rates that had been achieved by the control measure taken for previously circulating strains.","Piantham, C.; Ito, K.",2021-03-30,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.03.17.21253775,3,Kimihito Ito,Hokkaido University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.17.21253775v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.17.21253775v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
17700,COVID-19 Medical Vulnerability Indicators: A Local Data Model for Equity in Public Health Decision-Making,"ObjectiveTo develop indicators of vulnerability for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) infection in Los Angeles County (LAC) by race and neighborhood characteristics.

DesignDevelopment of indicators that combines pre-existing medical vulnerabilities with social and built-environment data by zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs).

SettingNeighborhoods in LAC categorized by race/ethnicity ranked into quintiles by relative vulnerability: Non-Hispanic white; Black; Latinx; Cambodians, Hmong and Laotians combined (CHL); and Other Asians.

Data SourcesAskCHIS Neighborhood Edition, American Community Survey 2014-2018, and California Department of Parks and Recreation.

Main Outcome Measures1) Pre-Existing Health Condition, 2) Barriers to Accessing Healthcare, 3) Built Environment Risk, and 4) CDCs Social Vulnerability.

ResultsNeighborhoods most vulnerable to COVID-19 are characterized by significant clustering of racial minorities, low income households and unmet medical needs. An overwhelming 73% of Blacks reside in the neighborhoods with the two highest quintiles of pre-existing health conditions, followed by Latinx (70%) and CHL (60%), while 60% of whites reside in low or the lowest vulnerable neighborhoods. For the Barriers to Accessing Healthcare indicator, 40% of Latinx reside in the highest vulnerability places followed by Blacks, CHL and other Asians (29%, 22%, and 16% respectively), compared with only 7% of Whites reside in such neighborhoods. The Built Environment Indicator finds CHL (63%) followed by Latinx (55%) and Blacks (53%) reside in the neighborhoods designated as high or the highest vulnerability compared to 32% of Whites residing in these neighborhoods. The Social Vulnerability Indicator finds 42% of Blacks and Latinx and 38% of CHL residing in neighborhoods of high vulnerability compared with only 8% of Whites residing these neighborhoods.

ConclusionsVulnerability to covid-19 infections differs by neighborhood and racial/ethnic groups. Our vulnerability indicators when utilized in decision-making of re-openings or resource distribution such as testing, vaccine distribution, hotel rooms for quarantine and other covid-19-related resources can provide an equity driven data approach for the most vulnerable.","Ong, P.

25562,A randomised clinical trial of azithromycin versus standard care in ambulatory COVID-19 - the ATOMIC2 trial,"BackgroundThe antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties of azithromycin suggest therapeutic potential against COVID-19. Randomised data in mild-moderate disease are lacking. We assessed whether azithromycin is effective in reducing hospitalisation in patients with mild-moderate COVID-19.

MethodsThis open-label, randomised superiority clinical trial at 19 centres in the United Kingdom enrolled adults, [&ge;]18 years, presenting to hospitals with clinically-diagnosed highly-probable or confirmed COVID-19 infection, with <14 days symptoms, considered suitable for initial ambulatory management. Patients were randomised (1:1) to azithromycin (500 mg daily orally for 14 days) or to standard care without macrolides. The primary outcome was the difference in proportion of participants with death or hospital admission from any cause over the 28 days from randomisation, assessed according to intention-to-treat (ITT). Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04381962, Study closed.

Findings298 participants were enrolled from 3rd June 2020 to 29th January 2021. The primary outcome was assessed in 292 participants. The primary endpoint was not significantly different between the azithromycin and control groups (Adjusted OR 0{middle dot}91 [95% CI 0{middle dot}43-1{middle dot}92], p=0{middle dot}80). Rates of respiratory failure, progression to pneumonia, all-cause mortality, and adverse events, including serious cardiovascular events, were not significantly different between groups.

InterpretationIn patients with mild-moderate COVID-19 managed without hospital admission, adding azithromycin to standard care treatment did not reduce the risk of subsequent hospitalisation or death. Our findings do not support the use of azithromycin in patients with mild-moderate COVID-19.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) with the terms (""""azithromycin"""") AND (""""COVID"""" OR """"COVID-19"""") AND (""""clinical trials""""), until March 25, 2021, with no language restrictions. We identified 42 studies, among which there were four completed randomised trials of azithromycin (with or without hydroxychloroquine) in hospitalised patients with severe disease, and three completed randomised trials of azithromycin in mild COVID-19 in primary care. The four trials in hospitalised patients randomised 8,988 participants to azithromycin or standard care or hydroxychloroquine and found no evidence of a difference in mortality, duration of hospital stay or peak disease severity. Of the three trials in primary care, these randomised participants with early disease to 3 or 5 days of therapy, of which only one assessed azithromycin as standalone therapy. This large, adaptive platform trial in the UK randomised 540 participants in primary care to 3 days treatment with azithromycin versus 875 to standard care alone and found no meaningful difference in time to first reported recovery, or of rates of hospitalisation (3% versus 3%) and there were no deaths. We did not identify any randomised trials in patients with COVID-19 managed in ambulatory care.

Added value of this studyThe ATOMIC2 trial was uniquely-designed to assess azithromycin as a standalone therapy in those with mild-moderately COVID-19 presenting to emergency care, but assessed as appropriate for initial ambulatory management without hospital admission. ATOMIC2 also uniquely assessed high-dose, long-duration treatment to investigate the efficacy of putative anti-inflammatory effects. We found that azithromycin 500 mg daily for 14 days did not reduce the proportion of participants who died or required hospital admission from any cause over the 28 days from randomisation.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur findings, taken together with existing data, suggest there is no evidence that azithromycin reduces hospitalisation, respiratory failure or death compared with standard care, either in early disease in the community, or those hospitalised with severe disease, or in those with moderate disease managed on an ambulatory pathway.","Hinks, T.

14998,Evaluating ten commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 rapid serological tests using the STARD (Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) method.,"Numerous SARS-CoV-2 rapid serological tests have been developed, but their accuracy has usually been assessed using very few samples, and rigorous comparisons between these tests are scarce. In this study, we evaluated and compared 10 commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 rapid serological tests using the STARD methodology (Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies). 250 sera from 159 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients (collected from 0 to 32 days after onset of symptoms) were tested with rapid serological tests. Control sera (N=254) were retrieved from pre-COVID periods from patients with other coronavirus infections (N=11), positive rheumatoid factors (N=3), IgG/IgM hyperglobulinemia (N=9), malaria (n=5), or no documented viral infection (N=226). All samples were tested using rapid lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA) from ten manufacturers. Only four tests achieved [&ge;]98% specificity, with other tests ranging from 75.7%-99.2%. Sensitivities varied by the day of sample collection, from 31.7%-55.4% (Days 0-9), 65.9%-92.9% (Days 10-14), and 81.0%-95.2% (>14 days) after the onset of symptoms, respectively. Only three tests evaluated met French Health Authorities' thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 serological tests ([&ge;]90% sensitivity + [&ge;]98% specificity). Overall, the performances between tests varied greatly, with only a third meeting acceptable specificity and sensitivity thresholds.

16684,IgM autoantibodies recognizing ACE2 are associated with severe COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2 infection induces severe disease in a subpopulation of patients, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We demonstrate robust IgM autoantibodies that recognize angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) in 18/66 (27%) patients with severe COVID-19, which are rare (2/52; 3.8%) in hospitalized patients who are not ventilated. The antibodies do not undergo class-switching to IgG, suggesting a T-independent antibody response. Purified IgM from anti-ACE2 patients activates complement. Pathological analysis of lung obtained at autopsy shows endothelial cell staining for IgM in blood vessels in some patients. We propose that vascular endothelial ACE2 expression focuses the pathogenic effects of these autoantibodies on blood vessels, and contributes to the angiocentric pathology observed in some severe COVID-19 patients. These findings may have predictive and therapeutic implications.

6377,Occurrence and Timing of Subsequent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Positivity Among Initially Negative Patients,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing remains the cornerstone of laboratory-based identification of patients with COVID-19. As the availability and speed of SARS-CoV-2 testing platforms improve, results are increasingly relied upon to inform critical decisions related to therapy, use of personal protective equipment, and workforce readiness. However, early reports of RT-PCR test performance have left clinicians and the public with concerns regarding the reliability of this predominant testing modality and the interpretation of negative results. In this work, two independent research teams report the frequency of discordant SARS-CoV-2 test results among initially negative, repeatedly tested patients in regions of the United States with early community transmission and access to testing.

MethodsAll patients at the University of Washington (UW) and Stanford Health Care undergoing initial testing by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab between March 2nd and April 7th, 2020 were included. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was performed targeting the N, RdRp, S, and E genes and ORF1ab, using a combination of Emergency Use Authorization laboratory-developed tests and commercial assays. Results through April 14th were extracted to allow for a complete 7-day observation period and an additional day for reporting.

ResultsA total of 23,126 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests (10,583 UW, 12,543 Stanford) were performed in 20,912 eligible patients (8,977 UW, 11,935 Stanford) undergoing initial testing by NP swab; 626 initially test-negative patients were re-tested within 7 days. Among this group, repeat testing within 7 days yielded a positive result in 3.5% (4.3% UW, 2.8% Stanford) of cases, suggesting an initial false negative RT-PCR result; the majority (96.5%) of patients with an initial negative result who warranted reevaluation for any reason remained negative on all subsequent tests performed within this window.

ConclusionsTwo independent research teams report the similar finding that, among initially negative patients subjected to repeat SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, the occurrence of a newly positive result within 7 days is uncommon. These observations suggest that false negative results at the time of initial presentation do occur, but potentially at a lower frequency than is currently believed.

7954,Pitting the Gumbel and logistic growth models against one another to model COVID-19 spread,"In this paper, we investigate briefly the appropriateness of the widely used logistic growth curve modeling with focus on COVID-19 spread, from a data-driven perspective. Specifically, we suggest the Gumbel growth model for behaviour of COVID-19 cases in European countries in addition to the United States of America (US), for better detecting the growth and prediction. We provide a suitable fit and predict the growth of cases for some selected countries as illustration. Our contribution will stimulate the correct growth spread modeling for this pandemic outbreak.","Bekker, A.; Yoo, K.; Arashi, M.",2020-05-26,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.24.20111633,1,Andriette Bekker,University of Pretoria,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.24.20111633v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.24.20111633v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
1826,Epidemic Situation of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia in China mainland,"ObjectiveAnalyze the occurrence of novel coronavirus pneumonia(NCP) in China mainland, explore the epidemiological rules, and evaluate the effect of prevention and control.

MethodsFrom December 1, 2019 to March 4, 2020, Analysis of 80,409 confirmed cases of NCP in China mainland.

ResultsFrom December 1, 2019 to March 4, 2020, a total of 80,409 cases of NCP were confirmed in China mainland, a total of 67,466 cases were confirmed in Hubei Province, a total of 49,671 cases were confirmed in Wuhan city. From December 1, 2019 to March 4, 2020, a total of 3,012 cases of NCP deaths in China mainland, the mortality was 3.75% (3012/80,409); A total of 52045 cases of cured in China mainland; The turning point of the epidemic have been reached since February 18.2020 in China mainland; The spread index of NCP gradually declined since January 27. 2020, and the extinction index of NCP rose little by little since January 29, 2020.

ConclusionFrom December 1, 2019 to March 4, 2020, NCP is under control, and the trend of the epidemic will eventually disappear; The turning point of an epidemic that Ive created is a great indicator that can calculate the turning date of an outbreak and provide a basis for scientific prevention.","Youbin, L.; Liming, G.; Bao Hong, L.",2020-05-10,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.02.17.20024034,2,Li Bao Hong,.Zhangye People\'s Hospital affiliated to Hexi University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024034v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024034v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
9886,SARS-CoV-2 Community Transmission During Shelter-in-Place in San Francisco,"BackgroundWe characterized SARS-CoV-2 infections in a densely-populated, majority Latinx San Francisco community six-weeks into the citys shelter-in-place order.

MethodsWe offered SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-PCR and antibody (Abbott ARCHITECT IgG) testing, regardless of symptoms, to all residents (>4 years) and workers in a San Francisco census tract (population: 5,174) at outdoor, community-mobilized events over four days. We estimated SARS-CoV-2 point prevalence (PCR-positive) and cumulative incidence (antibody or PCR-positive) in the census tract and evaluated risk factors for recent (PCR-positive/antibody-negative) versus prior infection (antibody-positive/PCR-negative). SARS-CoV-2 genome recovery and phylogenetics were used to measure viral strain diversity, establish viral lineages present, and estimate number of introductions.

ResultsWe tested 3,953 persons: 40% Latinx; 41% White; 9% Asian/Pacific Islander; and 2% Black. Overall, 2.1% (83/3,871) tested PCR-positive: 95% were Latinx and 52% asymptomatic when tested. 1.7% of residents and 6.0% of workers (non-census tract residents) were PCR-positive. Among 2,598 census tract residents, estimated point prevalence of PCR-positives was 2.3% (95%CI: 1.2-3.8%): 3.9% (95%CI: 2.0-6.4%) among Latinx vs. 0.2% (95%CI: 0.0-0.4%) among non-Latinx persons. Estimated cumulative incidence among residents was 6.1% (95%CI: 4.0-8.6%). Prior infections were 67% Latinx, 16% White, and 17% other ethnicities. Among recent infections, 96% were Latinx. Risk factors for recent infection were Latinx ethnicity, inability to shelter-in-place and maintain income, frontline service work, unemployment, and household income <$50,000/year. Five SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic lineages were detected.

ConclusionSARS-CoV-2 infections from diverse lineages continued circulating among low-income, Latinx persons unable to work from home and maintain income during San Franciscos shelter-in-place ordinance.","Chamie, G.; Marquez, C.; Crawford, E.; Peng, J.; Petersen, M.; Schwab, D.; Schwab, J.; Martinez, J.; Jones, D.; Black, D.; Gandhi, M.; Kerkhoff, A.

23010,Thyroid Function Analysis in COVID-19: A Retrospective Study from a Single Center,"Background and ObjectiveCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an on-going epidemic with a multitude of long-ranging effects on the physiological balance of the human body. It can cause several effects on thyroid functions as well. We aimed to assess the lasting sequelae of COVID-19 on thyroid hormone and the clinical course of the disease as a result.

MethodsOut of 76 patients, 48 patients of COVID-19 positive and 28 patients of COVID-19 negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were assessed for thyroid functions, IL-6, and Procalcitonin between moderate, severe, and critical pneumonia on HRCT.

ResultsSeventy-five percent of patients with COVID-19 had thyroid abnormalities and higher IL-6 levels (76.10 {+/-} 82.35 vs. 6.99 {+/-} 3.99, 95% CI 52.18-100.01, P-value <0.01). Logistic regression analysis suggested TT3 (P-value 0.01), IL-6 (P-value <0.01), and Procalcitonin (P-value 0.03) as independent risk factors for COVID-19. ROC curve demonstrated IL-6 as the most sensitive marker (P-value <0.01), and TT3, and Procalcitonin as the predictor for COVID-19 disease.

ConclusionThis pilot study from Pakistan demonstrates that changes in serum TSH and TT3 levels may be important manifestations of the courses of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Malik, J.; Malik, A.; Javaid, M.; Zahid, T.; Ishaq, U.; Shoaib, M.",2021-03-02,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.02.09.21251435,2,Jahanzeb Malik,Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.09.21251435v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.09.21251435v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
22137,Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in the Bronx enables clinical and epidemiological inference,"The Bronx was an early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA. We conducted temporal genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 genomes across the Bronx from March-October 2020. Although the local structure of SARS-CoV-2 lineages mirrored those of New York City and New York State, temporal sampling revealed a dynamic and changing landscape of SARS- CoV-2 genomic diversity. Mapping the trajectories of variants, we found that while some have become 'endemic' to the Bronx, other, novel variants rose in prevalence in the late summer/early fall. Geographically resolved genomes enabled us to distinguish between a case of reinfection and a case of persistent infection. We propose that limited, targeted, temporal genomic surveillance has clinical and epidemiological utility in managing the ongoing COVID pandemic.","Fels, J. M.; Khan, S.; Forster, R.; Skalina, K.

24136,Characteristics of Long Covid: findings from a social media survey,"Many people are not recovering for months after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Long Covid has emerged as a major public health concern that needs defining, quantifying, and describing. We aimed to explore the initial and ongoing symptoms of Long Covid following SARS-CoV-2 infection and describe its impact on daily life in people who were not admitted to hospital during the first two weeks of the illness. We co-produced a survey with people living with Long Covid. We collected the data through an online survey using convenience non-probability sampling, with the survey posted both specifically on Long Covid support groups and generally on social media. The criteria for inclusion were adults with lab-confirmed (PCR or antibody) or suspected COVID-19 managed in the community (non-hospitalised) in the first two weeks of illness. We used agglomerative hierarchical clustering to identify specific symptom clusters, and their demographic and functional correlates.

We analysed data from 2550 participants with a median duration of illness of 7.7 months (interquartile range (IQR) 7.4-8.0). The mean age was 46.5 years (standard deviation 11 years) with 82.8% females and 79.9% of participants based in the UK. 89.5% described their health as good, very good or excellent before COVID-19. The most common initial symptoms that persisted were exhaustion, chest pressure/tightness, shortness of breath and headache. Cough, fever, and chills were common initial symptoms that became less prevalent later in the illness, whereas cognitive dysfunction and palpitations became more prevalent later in the illness. 26.5% reported lab-confirmation of infection. The biggest difference in ongoing symptoms between those who reported testing positive and those who did not was loss of smell/taste. Ongoing symptoms affected at least 3 organ systems in 83.5% of participants.

Most participants described fluctuating (57.7%) or relapsing symptoms (17.6%). Physical activity, stress and sleep disturbance commonly triggered symptoms. A third (32%) reported they were unable to live alone without any assistance at six weeks from start of illness. 16.9% reported being unable to work solely due to COVID-19 illness. 66.4% reported taking time off sick (median of 60 days, IQR 20, 129). 37.0% reported loss of income due to illness, and 64.4% said they were unable to perform usual activities/duties.

Acute systems clustered broadly into two groups: a majority cluster (n=2235, 88%) with cardiopulmonary predominant symptoms, and a minority cluster (n=305, 12%) with multisystem symptoms. Similarly, ongoing symptoms broadly clustered in two groups; a majority cluster (n=2243, 88.8%) exhibiting mainly cardiopulmonary, cognitive symptoms and exhaustion, and a minority cluster (n=283, 11.2%) exhibited more multisystem symptoms. Belonging to the more severe multisystem cluster was associated with more severe functional impact, lower income, younger age, being female, worse baseline health, and inadequate rest in the first two weeks of the illness, with no major differences in the cluster patterns when restricting analysis to the lab-confirmed subgroup.

This is an exploratory survey of Long Covid characteristics. Whilst it is important to acknowledge that it is a non-representative population sample, it highlights the heterogeneity of persistent symptoms, and the significant functional impact of prolonged illness following confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. To study prevalence, predictors and prognosis, research is needed in a representative population sample using standardised case definitions (to include those not lab-confirmed in the first pandemic wave).","Ziauddeen, N.; Gurdasani, D.; O'hara, M.

15930,LUNG ULTRASOUND FINDINGS IN COVID-19 RESPIRATORY DISEASE AND CORRELATION TO DISEASE SEVERITY,"COVID-19 can present with respiratory symptoms ranging from mild cough to viral pneumonia and ARDS. Lung ultrasonography has emerged as a promising imaging modality during the pandemic, but there is still a paucity of systematic analysis of lung ultrasound findings.

In this retrospective observational study, 12 Zone ultrasound scans of COVID-19 positive patients were systematically analysed for pleural irregularities, subpleural consolidations, B lines, deep consolidations and effusions. Lung abnormalities were analysed according to overall frequency, frequency distribution in coronal and sagittal lung planes and were also correlated to clinical severity groups as determined by oxygenation deficit.

Our results show that lung zones with abnormalities can occur juxtaposed to normal lung. Irregular pleural and small subpleural consolidations appear ubiquitously distributed throughout both lungs and occur early in the disease process. Wide B-lines are a predominant feature in COVID-19 infection. B-lines are found in a variety of patterns with number and width correlated to disease severity. In our analysis we also describe a previously unrecognised finding of small peri-pleural effusions in 8.7% of scans occurring in all areas of the lung.

The current results form the basis for a more thorough understanding of the lung changes occurring in COVID-19 and the incorporation of lung ultrasound in the setting of COVID-19 infection including triage, diagnosis, treatment approach and prognosis.","Burkert, J.; Dunlop, H.; Stewart, R.; Treacy, A.; Jarman, R.; Deol, P.",2020-11-14,Emergency Medicine,10.1101/2020.09.28.20182626,2,Julia Burkert,Chelsea and Westminster NHS Foundation Trust,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.28.20182626v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.28.20182626v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
16600,Early Crowdfunding Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"BackgroundAs the number of COVID-19 cases increased precipitously in the US, policymakers and health officials marshalled their pandemic responses. As the economic impacts multiplied, anecdotal reports noted the increased use of online crowdfunding to defray these costs. We examined the online crowdfunding response in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US.

MethodsOn May 16, 2020, we extracted all available data available on US campaigns created between January 1 and May 10, 2020 on GoFundMe and identified the subset of COVID-related campaigns using keywords relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. We explored incidence of COVID-related campaigns by geography, by category, and over time and compared campaign characteristics to non-COVID-related campaigns after March 11 when the pandemic was declared.

ResultsWe found that there was a substantial increase in overall GoFundMe online crowdfunding campaigns in March, largely attributable to COVID-related campaigns. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic persisted and progressed, the number of campaigns per COVID-19 cases declined more than tenfold across all states. COVID-related campaigns raised more money, had a longer narrative description, and were more likely to be shared on Facebook than other campaigns in the study period.

ConclusionsOnline crowdfunding appears to be a transient stopgap, predicated on the novelty of an emergency rather than the true sustained need of a community. Rather, crowdfunding activity is likely an early marker for communities in acute distress that could be used by governments and aid organizations to guide disaster relief and policy.

5761,Compositional Cyber-Physical Epidemiology of COVID-19,"COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges globally. Countries have adopted different strategies with varying degrees of success. Epidemiologists are studying the impact of government actions using scenario analysis. However, the interactions between the government policy and the disease dynamics are not formally captured.

We, for the first time, formally study the interaction between the disease dynamics, which is modelled as a physical process, and the government policy, which is modelled as the adjoining controller. Our approach enables compositionality, where either the plant or the controller could be replaced by an alternative model. Our work is inspired by the engineering approach for the design of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Consequently, we term the new framework Compositional Cyber-Physical Epidemiology (CCPE). We created different classes of controllers and applied these to control the disease in New Zealand and Italy. Our controllers closely follow government decisions based on their published data. We not only reproduce the pandemic progression faithfully in New Zealand and Italy but also show the tradeoffs produced by differing control actions.","Ro, J.

Radom-effects meta-regression was performed using OpenMetaAnalyst (http://www.cebm.brown.edu/openmeta/index.html). A coefficient (slope of the meta-regression line) for COVID-19 prevalence was significantly negative for male sex, education attainment, computer and Internet use, and private health insurance. Whereas, the coefficient was significantly positive for black race, never matrimony, unemployment, and poverty. In the multivariable model, the coefficient was significantly negative for male sex (P = 0.036) and computer use (P = 0.024), and significantly positive for never matrimony (P < 0.001). A coefficient for COVID-19 fatality was significantly negative for no health insurance, and significantly positive for elderly, unemployment, and public coverage. In the multivariable model, the coefficient was significantly positive for only elderly (P = 0.002). In conclusion, a number of socioeconomic factors, e.g. male sex (negatively for prevalence), elderly (positively for fatality), never matrimony (positively for prevalence), and computer use (negatively for prevalence) may be associated with COVID-19.","Takagi, H.; Kuno, T.; Yokoyama, Y.; Ueyama, H.; Matsushiro, T.; Hari, Y.; Ando, T.",2020-05-27,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.25.20112599,1,Hisato Takagi,"Shizuoka Medical Center, Kitasato University School of Medicine",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.25.20112599v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.25.20112599v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1002/jmv.26335
4180,A Scalable Method of Applying Heat and Humidity for Decontamination of N95 Respirators During the COVID-19 Crisis,"A lack of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 crisis has placed healthcare workers at risk. It is important for any N95 reuse strategy to determine the effects that proposed protocols would have on the physical functioning of the mask, as well as the practical aspects of implementation. Here we propose and implement a method of heating N95 respirators with moisture (85 {degrees}C, 60-85% humidity). We test both mask filtration efficiency and fit to validate this process. Our tests focus on the 3M 1860, 3M 1870, and 3M 8210 Plus N95 models. After five cycles of the heating procedure, all three respirators pass both quantitative fit testing (score of >100) and show no degradation of mask filtration efficiency. We also test the Chen Heng V9501 KN95 and HKYQ N95 finding no degradation of mask filtration efficiency, however even for unheated masks these scored <50 for every fit test. The heating method presented here is scalable from individual masks to over a thousand a day with a single industrial convection oven, making this method practical for local application inside health-care facilities.","Anderegg, L.; Meisenhelder, C.; Ngooi, C.

21831,Effect of co-infection with parasites on severity of COVID-19,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection results in a spectrum of clinical presentations. The effect of co-infection with parasites on the clinical features of COVID-19 is unknown.

MethodsWe prospectively enrolled consecutive COVID-19 patients and screened them for intestinal parasitic infections. Patients were followed during hospitalization for clinical outcomes. Patients with parasitic co-infection were compared to those without parasitic co-infection. The primary outcome was the proportion of COVID-19 patients who developed severe disease. Factors associated with the development of severe disease were determined by logistic regression.

ResultsA total of 515 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened for intestinal parasites, of whom 267 (51.8%) were co-infected with one or more parasites. Parasitic co-infection correlated inversely with COVID-19 severity. Severe COVID-19 was significantly higher in patients without parasites [47/248 (19.0%, CI: 14.52-24.35)] than in those with parasites [21/267 (7.9%, CI: 5.17-11.79)]; p<0.0001. There was a significantly higher proportion of patients who developed severe COVID-19 in the non-protozoa group [56/369 (15.2%, CI: 11.85-19.23)] as compared to the protozoa group [12/146 (8.2%, CI: 4.70-14.00)]; p=0.036. Significant higher proportion of the patients presented at baseline with severe COVID-19 in the helminth negative group [57/341 (16.7%, CI: 13.10 - 21.08)] than in the group with pre-existing helminth infection [11/174 (6.3%, CI: 3.51 - 11.11)]; p=0.001. In addition, after adjustment for age and presence of comorbidities, COVID-19 patients with any parasite co-infection [aOR 0.41 (95% CI: 0.22-0.77); p=0.006], or with protozoa co-infection [aOR 0.45 (95% CI: 0.21-0.98); p=0.044] as well as those with helminth co-infection [aOR 0.37 (95% CI: 0.17-0.80); p=0.011] had lower probability of developing severe COVID-19 compared with those without parasite, protozoa or helminth co-infection.

ConclusionOur results suggest that co-infection with parasitic co-infection appears to be associated with reduced COVID-19 severity. The results suggest that parasite-driven immunomodulatory responses may mute hyperinflammation associated with severe COVID-19.","Gebrecherkos, T.; Gessesse, Z.; Kebede, Y.; Gebreegzabher, A.; Tassew, G.; Abdulkader, M.; Ebuy, H.; Desta, A.; Hailu, A.; Harris, V.; Rinke De Wit, T.; Wolday, D.",2021-02-03,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.02.02.21250995,1,Dawit Wolday,Mekelle University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.02.21250995v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.02.21250995v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
9514,Priority Setting of Ventilators in the COVID-19 Pandemic from the public's perspective,"BackgroundVentilator allocation plan for public health crisis should be developed through recognizing the values of society and engaging the general public. This study was conducted to assess the Iranian citizens attitude about a number of principles and criteria for allocation of ventilators in current COVID-19 epidemic.

Materials and MethodsAn electronic self-administered questionnaire was publicly distributed through social networks of Telegram and WhatsApp to perform this cross-sectional study. The questionnaire consisted of 11 statements about the selection and prioritization of patients for the use of a ventilator.

Results1262 persons, including 767 citizens and 495 health care providers participated in this study. More than 95% of participants agreed upon the necessity to avoid discrimination and avoid prioritization according to patients gender, economic and political status. While 40.9% of citizens and 49.6% of healthcare workers believed that a ventilator can be disconnected from a patient with a poor prognosis to help a patient who has a better prognosis (P-value=0.13), 34.3% of people and 29.6% of healthcare workers believed that the earlier admitted patients have the right to receive the device even if the likeliness of his/her survival is less than the next patient (P-value=0.009).

ConclusionsThis study showed that people accept maximizing health benefits as a measure of ventilator allocation in the pandemic of COVID-19. At the same time, periodic evaluation of patients and disconnecting the device from a patient that no longer benefits from ICU services requires its scientific and ethical basis to be brought in public discourse.","Asghari, F.; Parsapour, A.; Shamsi Gooshki, E.",2020-06-12,Medical Ethics,10.1101/2020.06.10.20127290,1,Fariba Asghari,Tehran University of Medical Sciences,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.10.20127290v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.10.20127290v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.1080/23294515.2021.1907474
13383,Integrating psychosocial variables and societal diversity in epidemic models for predicting COVID-19 transmission dynamics,"During the current COVID-19 pandemic, governments must make decisions based on a variety of information including estimations of infection spread, health care capacity, economic and psychosocial considerations. The disparate validity of current short-term forecasts of these factors is a major challenge to governments. By causally linking an established epidemiological spread model with dynamically evolving psychosocial variables, using Bayesian inference we estimate the strength and direction of these interactions for German and Danish data of disease spread, human mobility, and psychosocial factors based on the serial cross-sectional COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO; N = 16,981). We demonstrate that the strength of cumulative influence of psychosocial variables on infection rates is of a similar magnitude as the influence of physical distancing. We further show that the efficacy of political interventions to contain the disease strongly depends on societal diversity, in particular group-specific sensitivity to affective risk perception. As a consequence, the model may assist in quantifying the effect and timing of interventions, forecasting future scenarios, and differentiating the impact on diverse groups as a function of their societal organization. Importantly, the careful handling of societal factors, including support to the more vulnerable groups, adds another direct instrument to the battery of political interventions fighting epidemic spread.","Jirsa, V.; Petkoski, S.; Wang, H.; Woodman, M.; Fousek, J.; Betsch, C.; Felgendreff, L.; Bohm, R.; Lilleholt, L.; Zettler, I.; Faber, S.; Shen, K.; Mcintosh, A.

5573,"The nexus of travel restriction, air pollution and COVID-19 infection: Investigation from a megacity of the southern China","To control and prevent the spread of COVID-19, generalized social distancing measures, such as traffic control and travel restriction acted in China. Previous studies indicated that the traffic conditions had significant influence on the air quality, and which was related to the respiratory diseases. This study aimed to reveal the nexus of travel restriction, air pollution and COVID-19. Shenzhen, one of the top 4 megacities in China was considered as the study area, statistical analysis methods, including linear/nonlinear regression and bivariate correlation was conducted to evaluate the relationship of the traffic and passenger population, travel intensity, NO2, PM10, PM2.5 and the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. The results suggested that traffic control and travel restriction had a significant correlation with the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases, which shown negative correlation with the traffic intensity of the city, NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 show significant positive correlation with the traffic intensity, traffic control and travel restriction would slow down and prevent the spread of the viruses at the outbreak period. Different study scale might results in different results, thus the research focused on the nexus of traffic control and travel restriction, air pollution and COVID-19 should been enhanced in future, and differentiated epidemic control and prevention measures should be considered according to the different situation of cities as well as countries.","Li, W.; Chen, X.",2020-05-07,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.04.25.20079335,2,Wei Li,shenzhen academy of environmental sciences,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079335v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079335v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
20313,The evaluation of a newly developed antigen test (QuickNavi™-COVID19 Ag) for SARS-CoV-2: A prospective observational study in Japan,"IntroductionSeveral antigen tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been developed worldwide, but their clinical utility has not been well established. In this study, we evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of QuickNavi-COVID19 Ag, a newly developed antigen test in Japan.

MethodsThis prospective observational study was conducted at a PCR center between October 7 and December 5, 2020. The included patients were referred from a local public health center and 89 primary care facilities. We simultaneously obtained two nasopharyngeal samples with flocked swabs; one was used for the antigen test and the other for real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Using the results of real-time RT-PCR as a reference, the performance of the antigen test was evaluated.

ResultsA total of 1186 patients were included in this study, and the real-time RT-PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 in 105 (8.9%). Of these 105 patients, 33 (31.4%) were asymptomatic. The antigen test provided a 98.8% (95% confident interval [CI]: 98.0%-99.4%) concordance rate with real-time RT-PCR, along with a sensitivity of 86.7% (95% CI: 78.6%-92.5%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 99.7%-100%). False-negatives were observed in 14 patients, 8 of whom were asymptomatic and had a low viral load (cycle threshold (Ct) >30). In symptomatic patients, the sensitivity was 91.7% (95% CI: 82.7%-96.9%).

ConclusionQuickNavi-COVID19 Ag showed high specificity and sufficient sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. This test is a promising potential diagnostic modality especially in symptomatic patients.","Takeuchi, Y.; Akashi, Y.; Kato, D.; Kuwahara, M.; Muramatsu, S.; Ueda, A.; Notake, S.; Nakamura, K.; Ishikawa, H.; Suzuki, H.",2021-01-03,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.12.27.20248876,2,Yusaku Akashi,"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Tsukuba Medical Center Hospital",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.27.20248876v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.27.20248876v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1016/j.jiac.2021.02.029

Recently, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater has emerged as a useful tool to monitor the prevalence of the virus in the community. Here, we propose a novel methodology, called lineagespot, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in wastewater samples using next-generation sequencing. Our proposed method was tested and evaluated using NGS data produced by the sequencing of three wastewater samples from the municipality of Thessaloniki, Greece, covering three distinct time periods. The results showed a clear identification of trends in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 mutations in sewage data, and allowed for a robust inference between the variants evident through our approach and the variants observed in patients from the same area time periods.

19781,Exploring patient experiences of video consultations during Covid-19 in an outpatient care setting using routine feedback data from 955 contacts,"BackgroundVideo consultations (VCs) were rapidly implemented in response to COVID-19, despite modest progress prior to the pandemic.

ObjectivesTo explore staff and patient experiences of VCs implemented during COVID-19, and use feedback insights to support quality improvement and service development.

MethodsSecondary data analysis was conducted on 955 (22.6%) patient responses and 521 (12.3%) staff responses routinely collected following a VC between June-July 2020 in a rural, aging and outpatient care setting at a single NHS Trust. Patient and staff feedback were summarised using descriptive statistics and inductive thematic analysis and presented to Trust stakeholders.

ResultsMost (93.2%) patients reported having  good (n=210, 22.0%), or  very good (n=680, 71.2%) experience with VCs and felt listened to and understood (n=904, 94.7%). Most patients accessed their VC alone (n=806, 84.4%), except for those aged 71+ (n=23/58, 39.7%), with ease of joining VCs negatively associated with age (P<.001). Despite more difficulties joining, older people were most likely to be satisfied with the technology (n=46/58, 79.3%). Both patients and staff generally felt patients needs had been met (n=860, 90.1%, n=453, 86.9% respectively), although staff appeared to overestimate patient dissatisfaction with VC outcome (P=.021). Patients (n=848, 88.8%) and staff (n=419, 80.5%) generally felt able to communicate everything they wanted, although patients were significantly more positive than staff (P<.001). Patient satisfaction with communication was positively associated with technical performance satisfaction (P<.001). Most staff (89.8%) reported positive (n=185, 35.5%), or very positive (n=281, 54.3%) experiences of joining and managing a VC. Staff reported reductions in carbon footprint (n=380, 72.9%) and time (n=373, 71.6%). Most (n=880, 92.1%) patients would choose VCs again. Inductive thematic analysis of patient and staff responses identified three themes: i) barriers including technological difficulties, patient information and suitability concerns; ii) potential benefits including reduced stress, enhanced accessibility, cost and time savings; and iii) suggested improvements including trial calls, turning music off, photo uploads, expanding written character limit, supporting other internet browsers and shared interactive screen. This routine feedback, including evidence to suggest patients were more satisfied than clinicians had anticipated, was presented to relevant Trust stakeholders allowing improved processes and supporting development of a business case to inform the Trust decision on continuing VCs beyond COVID-19 restrictions.

ConclusionsFindings highlight the importance of regularly reviewing and responding to routine feedback following the implementation of a new digital service. Feedback helped the Trust improve the VC service, challenge clinician held assumptions about patient experience and inform future use of VCs. The feedback has focussed improvement efforts on patient information, technological improvements such as blurred backgrounds and interactive white boards, and responding to the needs of patients with dementia, communication or cognitive impairment or lack of appropriate technology. Findings have implications for other health providers.","Bradwell, H. L.; Baines, R.; Edwards, K. R. J.; Stevens, S.; Atkinson, K.; Wilkinson, E.; Jones, R.

Secondly we consider an age-structured SEIR model with 3 age groups (youngster, adult and elderly) and we analyze the current strategy in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, of focusing the vaccination on the elderly group. We conclude by showing this strategy to be mistaken and that a vaccination focusing on the age group of the adults would be much more efficient in decreasing the total number of infected individuals.","Marchesin, M.

5590,Pregnancy and breastfeeding during COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review of published pregnancy cases,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic is an emerging concern regarding the potential adverse effects during pregnancy. This study reviews knowledge on the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and describes the outcome of published cases of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19.

MethodsSearches were conducted in PubMed(R) up to 8 April 2020, using PRISMA standards, to identify original published studies describing pregnant women at any gestational age diagnosed COVID-19. There were no date or language restrictions on the search. All identified studies were included irrespective of assumptions on study quality.

ResultsWe identified 30 original studies reporting 212 cases of pregnant women with COVID-19 (30 discharged while pregnant), 200 from China and 12 from other countries. The 182 published deliveries resulted in one stillbirth and 185 live births. Four women with severe COVID-19 required admission to an intensive care unit but no cases of maternal death were reported. There was one neonatal death. Preterm births occurred in 28.7% of cases, but it is unclear whether this was iatrogenic. All cases with amniotic fluid, placenta, and/or cord blood analyzed for the SARS-CoV-2 virus were negative. Four newborns were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and three newborns had high levels of IgM antibodies. Breast milk samples from 13 mothers and described in seven studies showed no evidence of SARS-CoV-2.

ConclusionThe evidence related to the effect of COVID-19 on pregnant women is still limited. Pregnant women and newborns should be considered particularly vulnerable populations regarding COVID-19 prevention and management strategies.","Rodrigues, C.; Baia, I.; Domingues, R.; Barros, H.",2020-05-05,Obstetrics And Gynecology,10.1101/2020.04.25.20079509,2,Carina Rodrigues,Instituto de Saude Publica da Universidade do Porto,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079509v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079509v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3389/fpubh.2020.558144
6800,Facemasks prevent influenza-like illness: implications for COVID-19,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is causing a huge toll on individuals, families, communities and societies across the world. Currently, whether wearing facemasks in public should be a measure to prevent transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains contraversial.1 This is largely because there have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for coronavirus to directly support this. However, lessons may be taken from published RCTs examining influenza-like illness (ILI).2,3 Recent studies suggested that SARS-CoV-2 shares similar transmission route with influenza virus,4 and the incidence of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with ILI is high.5 Therefore, we undertook this meta-analysis of RCTs examining the efficacy of wearing facemasks to prevent ILI in community settings, irrespective of confirmatory testing for the causative virus.

We undertook a systematic literature search for RCTs related to facemasks and ILI between 1966 and April 2020 using PUBMED, EMBASE, and Cochrane library. RCTs undertaken in community (not hospital) settings comparing wearing and not wearing facemasks for ILI were included. Incidence of ILI (e.g., fever, cough, headache, sore throat, aches or pains in muscles or joints) was estimated per group. Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.

We screened 899 related abstracts and eventually included 8 RCTs (Figure S1). Basic characteristics and quality of included RCTs are listed in Supplement. Participants wearing facemasks had a significantly lower risk of developing ILI than those not wearing facemasks (pooled RR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.70-0.95) and there was no heterogeneity (Figure 1). The decreased risk of ILI was more pronounced if everyone wore facemask irrespective of whether they were infected or not (RR=0.77, 95% CI: 0.65-0.91), compared to those wearing facemasks when infected (RR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.58-1.56) or uninfected (RR=1.26, 95% CI: 0.69-2.31).

This study shows that wearing facemasks, irrespective of infection status, is effective in preventing ILI spread in the community. This situation mirrors what is happening now in public settings where we do not know who has been infected and who has not. Although there are no RCTs of facemasks for SARS-CoV-2, as with other simple measures such as social distancing and handwashing, these data support the recommendation to wear facemasks in public to further reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and flatten the curve of this pandemic, especially when social distancing is impractical, such as shopping, or travelling with public transport for work that cannot be done from home.","Wei, J.; Doherty, M.; Persson, M.

19693,"Safety and immunogenicity trial of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-BBV152: a phase 1, double-blind, randomised control trial","BackgroundBBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulated with a TLR 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel-IMDG).

MethodsWe conducted a double-blind randomized controlled phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of BBV152. A total of 375 participants were randomized equally to receive three vaccine formulations (n=100 each) prepared with 3 g with Algel-IMDG, 6 g with Algel-IMDG, and 6 g with Algel, and an Algel only control arm (n=75). Vaccines were administered on a two-dose intramuscular accelerated schedule on day 0 (baseline) and day 14. The primary outcomes were reactogenicity and safety. The secondary outcomes were immunogenicity based on the anti-IgG S1 response (detected with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and wild-type virus neutralization [microneutralization and plaque reduction neutralization assays]). Cell-mediated responses were also evaluated.

ResultsReactogenicity was absent in the majority of participants, with mild events. The majority of adverse events were mild and were resolved. One serious adverse event was reported, which was found to be unrelated to vaccination. All three vaccine formulations resulted in robust immune responses comparable to a panel of convalescent serum. No significant differences were observed between the 3-g and 6-g Algel-IMDG groups. Neutralizing responses to homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV-2 strains were detected in all vaccinated individuals. Cell-mediated responses were biased to a Th-1 phenotype.

ConclusionsBBV152 induced binding and neutralising antibody responses and with the inclusion of the Algel-IMDG adjuvant, this is the first inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that has been reported to induce a Th1-biased response. Vaccine induced neutralizing antibody titers were reported with two divergent SARS-CoV-2 strains. BBV152 is stored between 2{degrees}C and 8{degrees}C, which is compatible with all national immunization program cold chain requirements. Both Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for the phase 2 immunogenicity trials. Further efficacy trials are underway.

24184,Improving COVID-19 vaccination centre operation through computer modelling and simulation,"Mass vaccination is widely considered to offer the only route out of the COVID-19 pandemic in a way that social restrictions can be eased and economic activity can safely resume without compromising healthcare services. For many countries, dedicated vaccination centres are a key part of that effort. However, with no directly comparable historical experience there is little information to guide the operational configuration and management of these sites. In addressing this gap in knowledge, the objective of this study is to demonstrate the value of computer modelling. This is achieved through providing an account of its use in supporting management considerations and decisions at two major vaccination centres, at an early stage of the UKs mass vaccination effort. We report on how modelling insight has influenced the initial setup of one site, including quantification of daily booking numbers. For the same site, we reveal how analysis has informed a significant operational shift in combining two key activities on the vaccination pathway into one. Finally, we describe how, at a second site, modelling has been used to examine pathway stability, in terms of resilience to unforeseen  shocks such as delayed arrivals and staff unavailability. Alongside the open-source simulation software, the modelling insights reported here can support managers to better plan and improve the operation of COVID-19 vaccination centres.","Wood, R.

21966,Genomic epidemiology identifies emergence and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 in the United States,"As of January of 2021, the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2, which was first identified in the United Kingdom (U.K.), has gained a strong foothold across the world. Because of the sudden and rapid rise of B.1.1.7, we investigated the prevalence and growth dynamics of this variant in the United States (U.S.), tracking it back to its early emergence and onward local transmission. We found that the RT-qPCR testing anomaly of S gene target failure (SGTF), first observed in the U.K., was a reliable proxy for B.1.1.7 detection. We sequenced 212 B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected from testing facilities in the U.S. from December 2020 to January 2021. We found that while the fraction of B.1.1.7 among SGTF samples varied by state, detection of the variant increased at a logistic rate similar to those observed elsewhere, with a doubling rate of a little over a week and an increased transmission rate of 35-45%. By performing time-aware Bayesian phylodynamic analyses, we revealed several independent introductions of B.1.1.7 into the U.S. as early as late November 2020, with onward community transmission enabling the variant to spread to at least 30 states as of January 2021. Our study shows that the U.S. is on a similar trajectory as other countries where B.1.1.7 rapidly became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, requiring immediate and decisive action to minimize COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.","Washington, N.

22155,Large-scale silane bead-based SARS-CoV-2 testing of a nursing home in Spain identifies a viral reservoir during lockdown period,"Background: Spain is one of the countries most heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As in other countries such as UK and USA, nursing homes have been an important human reservoir for the virus and the population with the highest mortality worldwide. The presence of asymptomatic carriers within nursing homes is one of the factors that could provoke new outbreaks during the relaxing of lockdown measures. Methods: We developed a high-throughput protocol for RNA extraction of patient samples based on silane magnetic beads in multi-well plates. The sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility rates were assessed using positive and negative clinical samples from the Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Spain. We utilized the protocol to test a pilot cohort of 138 residents and 87 staff from a nursing home in Northern Navarre, Spain. Findings: Our protocol showed high sensitivity (100%), specificity (96.0%) and linear correlation with PCR cycle threshold values obtained with a standard testing kit (R2 = 0.807, p=3E-05). Testing of 225 individuals from the nursing home revealed 63 residents (46%) and 14 staff (16%) positive for SARS-CoV-2. Only 18 of the positive residents (28.6%) were symptomatic at time of testing. During follow-up, six PCR-negative symptomatic residents were retested and resulted positive. One-month mortality among positive residents was higher than in negative residents (15.9% vs 1.3%), regardless of age or comorbidities. Interpretation: Rapid silane bead-based RNA extraction expanded the testing capabilities and COVID-19 patients were promptly identified. Personal and public health measures were enacted to avoid spreading and tighten clinical surveillance. The ability to easily adapt the technical capabilities of academic research centers to large-scale testing for SARS-CoV-2 could provide an invaluable tool for ensuring a safe lifting of lockdown in countries with high numbers of cases.","Weber, N.; Goni-Salaverri, A.; Rodriguez, J.

21254,An external validation of the QCovid risk prediction algorithm for risk of mortality from COVID-19 in adults: national validation cohort study in England,"BackgroundTo externally validate a risk prediction algorithm (QCovid) to estimate mortality outcomes from COVID-19 in adults in England.

MethodsPopulation-based cohort study using the ONS Public Health Linked Data Asset, a cohort based on the 2011 Census linked to Hospital Episode Statistics, the General Practice Extraction Service Data for pandemic planning and research, radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy records. The primary outcome was time to COVID-19 death, defined as confirmed or suspected COVID-19 death as per death certification. Two time periods were used: (a) 24th January to 30th April 2020; and (b) 1st May to 28th July 2020. We evaluated the performance of the QCovid algorithms using measures of discrimination and calibration for each validation time period.

FindingsThe study comprises 34,897,648 adults aged 19-100 years resident in England. There were 26,985 COVID-19 deaths during the first time-period and 13,177 during the second. The algorithms had good calibration in the validation cohort in both time periods with close correspondence of observed and predicted risks. They explained 77.1% (95% CI: 76.9% to 77.4%) of the variation in time to death in men in the first time-period (R2); the D statistic was 3.76 (95% CI: 3.73 to 3.79); Harrells C was 0.935 (0.933 to 0.937). Similar results were obtained for women, and in the second time-period. In the top 5% of patients with the highest predicted risks of death, the sensitivity for identifying deaths in the first time period was 65.9% for men and 71.7% for women. People in the top 20% of predicted risks of death accounted for 90.8% of all COVID-19 deaths for men and 93.0% for women.

InterpretationThe QCovid population-based risk algorithm performed well, showing very high levels of discrimination for COVID-19 deaths in men and women for both time periods. It has the potential to be dynamically updated as the pandemic evolves and therefore, has potential use in guiding national policy.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPublic policy measures and clinical risk assessment relevant to COVID-19 need to be aided by rigorously developed and validated risk prediction models. A recent living systematic review of published risk prediction models for COVID-19 found most models are subject to a high risk of bias with optimistic reported performance, raising concern that these models may be unreliable when applied in practice. A population-based risk prediction model, QCovid risk prediction algorithm, has recently been developed to identify adults at high risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes, which overcome many of the limitations of previous tools.

Added value of this studyCommissioned by the Chief Medical Officer for England, we validated the novel clinical risk prediction model (QCovid) to identify risks of short-term severe outcomes due to COVID-19. We used national linked datasets from general practice, death registry and hospital episode data for a population-representative sample of over 34 million adults. The risk models have excellent discrimination in men and women (Harrells C statistic>0.9) and are well calibrated. QCovid represents a new, evidence-based opportunity for population risk-stratification.

Implications of all the available evidenceQCovid has the potential to support public health policy, from enabling shared decision making between clinicians and patients in relation to health and work risks, to targeted recruitment for clinical trials, and prioritisation of vaccination, for example.","Nafilyan, V.; Humberstone, B.; Metha, N.; Diamond, I.; Lorenzi, L.; Pawelek, P.; Schofield, R.; Morgan, J.; Brown, P.; Lyons, R.; Sheikh, A.; Hippisley-Cox, J.",2021-01-25,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.01.22.21249968,1,Vahe Nafilyan,Office for National Statistics,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.22.21249968v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.22.21249968v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
24061,A simple model for how the risk of pandemics from different virus families depends on viral and human traits,"Different virus families, like influenza or corona viruses, exhibit characteristic traits such as typical modes of transmission and replication as well as specific animal reservoirs in which each family of viruses circulate. These traits of genetically related groups of viruses influence how easily an animal virus can adapt to infect humans, how well novel human variants can spread in the population, and the risk of causing a global pandemic. Relating the traits of virus families to their risk of causing future pandemics, and identification of the key time scales within which public health interventions can control the spread of a new virus that could cause a pandemic, are obviously significant. We address these issues using a minimal model whose parameters are related to characteristic traits of different virus families. A key trait of viruses that """"spillover"""" from animal reservoirs to infect humans is their ability to propagate infection through the human population (fitness). We find that the risk of pandemics emerging from virus families characterized by a wide distribution of the fitness of spillover strains is much higher than if such strains were characterized by narrow fitness distributions around the same mean. The dependences of the risk of a pandemic on various model parameters exhibit inflection points. We find that these inflection points define informative thresholds. For example, the inflection point in variation of pandemic risk with time after the spillover represents a threshold time beyond which global interventions would likely be too late to prevent a pandemic.","Doelger, J.; Chakraborty, A.

24314,Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine receipt at two integrated healthcare systems in New York City: A Cross sectional study of healthcare workers,"ObjectivesTo examine factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine receipt among healthcare workers, including healthcare worker job type, race, and gender, as well as the role of vaccine confidence in decisions to vaccinate, and to better understand specific concerns related to COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare workers.

DesignCross-sectional anonymous survey among front-line, support service, and administrative healthcare workers.

SettingTwo large integrated healthcare systems (one private and one public) in New York City during the initial rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine among healthcare workers.

Participants1,933 healthcare workers, including nurses, physicians, allied health professionals, environmental services staff, researchers, and administrative staff.

Main Outcome MeasuresThe primary outcome was COVID-19 vaccine receipt during the initial rollout of the vaccine among healthcare workers.

ResultsAmong 1,933 healthcare workers who had been offered the vaccine, 81% had received the vaccine at the time of the survey. Receipt was lower among Black (58%) compared with White (91%) healthcare workers; and lower among Hispanic (69%) compared with non-Hispanic (84%) healthcare workers. Among healthcare workers with concerns about COVID-19 vaccine safety, 65% received the vaccine. Among healthcare workers who agreed with the statement that the vaccine is important to protect family members, 86% were vaccinated. Of those who disagreed, 25% received the vaccine. Across all participants, 27% expressed concern about being experimented on with the COVID-19 vaccine. In a multivariable analysis, concern about being experimented on with the COVID-19 vaccine, concerns about COVID-19 vaccine safety, lack of influenza vaccine receipt, disagreeing that COVID-19 vaccination is important to protect family members, and Black race were independently associated with COVID-19 vaccine non-receipt. Over 70% of all healthcare workers responded that they had been approached for vaccine advice multiple times by family, community members, and patients.

ConclusionsOur data demonstrated high overall receipt among healthcare workers. Even among healthcare workers with concerns about COVID-19 vaccine safety, side effects, or being experimented on, over 50% received the vaccine. Attitudes around the importance of COVID-19 vaccination to protect others played a large role in healthcare workers decisions to vaccinate. We observed striking inequities in COVID-19 vaccine receipt, particularly affecting Black and Hispanic workers. Further research is urgently needed in developing strategies with healthcare workers to address issues related to vaccine equity and uptake in the context of systemic racism and barriers to care. This is particularly important given the influence healthcare workers have in vaccine decision-making conversations in their communities.

SUMMARY BOXES

What is already known?O_LIHigh uptake of effective COVID-19 vaccines among healthcare workers is critical to pandemic response.
C_LIO_LIIn studies of potential COVID-19 vaccine acceptance prior to COVID-19 vaccine availability, people who identified as Black were less likely to indicate they would accept the vaccine.
C_LIO_LIUnderstanding reasons why some healthcare workers chose not to get the COVID-19 vaccine will help us develop interventions to improve COVID-19 vaccine confidence among healthcare workers and in their communities.

5860,Beyond the Spike: identification of viral targets of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in December 2019 and caused a pandemic associated with a spectrum of COVID-19 disease ranging from asymptomatic to lethal infection. Serology testing is important for diagnosis of infection, determining infection attack rates and immunity in the population. It also informs vaccine development. Although several serology tests are in use, improving their specificity and sensitivity for early diagnosis on the one hand and for detecting past infection for population-based studies, are priorities.

MethodsWe evaluated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles to 15 SARS-CoV-2 antigens by cloning and expressing 15 open reading frames (ORFs) in mammalian cells and screened antibody responses to them in COVID-19 patients using the Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS).

ResultsThe LIPS technique allowed us to detect antibody responses in COVID-19 patients to 11 of the 15 SARS-CoV-2 antigens tested, identifying novel immunogenic targets. This technique shows that antigens ORF3b and ORF8 allow detection of antibody early in infection in a specific manner and reveals the immuno-dominance of the N antigen in COVID-19 patients.

ConclusionOur report provides an unbiased characterization of antibody responses to a range of SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The combination of 3 SARS-CoV-2 antibody LIPS assays, i.e. N, ORF3b, and ORF8, is sufficient to identify all COVID-19 patients of our cohort even at early time-points of illness, whilst Spike alone fails to do so. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of investigating new immunogens NSP1, ORF3b, ORF7a and ORF8 which may mediate immune functions other than neutralization which may be beneficial or harmful to the patient.","Hachim, A.; Kavian, N.; Cohen, C.

4958,Self-burnout - a new path to the end of COVID-19,"In this work we use mathematical modeling to describe a possible route to the end of COVID-19, which does not feature either vaccination or herd immunity. We call this route self-burnout. We consider a region with (a) no influx of corona cases from the outside, (b) extensive social distancing, though not necessarily a full lockdown, and (c) high testing capacity relative to the actual number of new cases per day. These conditions can make it possible for the region to initiate the endgame phase of epidemic management, wherein the disease is slowly made to burn itself out through a combination of social distancing, sanitization, contact tracing and preventive testing. The dynamics of the case trajectories in this regime are governed by a single-variable first order linear delay differential equation, whose stability criterion can be obtained analytically. Basis this criterion, we conclude that the social mobility restrictions should be such as to ensure that on the average, one person interacts closely (from the transmission viewpoint) with at most one other person over a 4-5 day period. If the endgame can be played out for a long enough time, we claim that the Coronavirus can eventually get completely contained without affecting a significant fraction of the regions population. We present estimates of the duration for which the epidemic is expected to last, finding an interval of approximately 5-15 weeks after the self-burnout phase is initiated. South Korea, Austria, Australia, New Zealand and the states of Goa, Kerala and Odisha in India appear to be well on the way towards containing COVID by this method.","Shayak, B.; Rand, R.

5892,How and when to end the COVID-19 lockdown: an optimisation approach,"Countries around the world are in a state of lockdown to help limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, as the number of new daily confirmed cases begins to decrease, governments must decide how to release their populations from quarantine as efficiently as possible without overwhelming their health services. We applied an optimal control framework to an adapted Susceptible-Exposure-Infection-Recovery (SEIR) model framework to investigate the efficacy of two potential lockdown release strategies, focusing on the UK population as a test case. To limit recurrent spread, we find that ending quarantine for the entire population simultaneously is a high-risk strategy, and that a gradual re-integration approach would be more reliable. Furthermore, to increase the number of people that can be first released, lockdown should not be ended until the number of new daily confirmed cases reaches a sufficiently low threshold.

We model a gradual release strategy by allowing different fractions of those in lockdown to re-enter the working non-quarantined population. Mathematical optimisation methods, combined with our adapted SEIR model, determine how to maximise those working while preventing the health service from being overwhelmed. The optimal strategy is broadly found to be to release approximately half the population two-to-four weeks from the end of an initial infection peak, then wait another three-to-four months to allow for a second peak before releasing everyone else. We also modelled an """"on-off"""" strategy, of releasing everyone, but re-establishing lockdown if infections become too high. We conclude that the worst-case scenario of a gradual release is more manageable than the worst-case scenario of an on-off strategy, and caution against lockdown-release strategies based on a threshold-dependent on-off mechanism.

The two quantities most critical in determining the optimal solution are transmission rate and the recovery rate, where the latter is defined as the fraction of infected people in any given day that then become classed as recovered. We suggest that the accurate identification of these values is of particular importance to the ongoing monitoring of the pandemic.","Rawson, T.; Brewer, T.; Veltcheva, D.; Huntingford, C.; Bonsall, M.

15062,Environment influences SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the absence of non-pharmaceutical interventions,"As COVID-19 continues to spread across the world, it is increasingly important to understand the factors that influence its transmission. Seasonal variation driven by responses to changing environment has been shown to affect the transmission intensity of several coronaviruses. However, the impact of the environment on SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unknown, and thus seasonal variation remains a source of uncertainty in forecasts of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here we address this issue by assessing the association of temperature, humidity, UV radiation, and population density with estimates of transmission rate (R). Using data from the United States of America, we explore correlates of transmission across USA states using comparative regression and integrative epidemiological modelling. We find that policy intervention (`lockdown') and reductions in individuals' mobility are the major predictors of SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates, but in their absence lower temperatures and higher population densities are correlated with increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Our results show that summer weather cannot be considered a substitute for mitigation policies, but that lower autumn and winter temperatures may lead to an increase in transmission intensity in the absence of policy interventions or behavioural changes. We outline how this information may improve the forecasting of SARS-CoV-2, its future seasonal dynamics, and inform intervention policies.","Smith, T. P.; Flaxman, S.; Gallinat, A. S.; Kinosian, S.

MethodsThis cross-sectional study using a self-administrated questionnaire survey was conducted from December 22 to 25, 2020, in Japan. The subjects were asked single-item questions about the intensity of telework and three-item questions about work engagement using the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale. Coefficients were estimated using a multilevel regression model nested by prefecture of residence and adjusted for covariates.

ResultsHigh-intensity (four or more days per week) telework was not associated with high work engagement for men or women. In contrast, low and moderate intensity (three days per week to once per month) were associated with high work engagement. The results were consistent when stratified by sex.

ConclusionsReasonable-intensity telework may have beneficial effects on work engagement.

20743,Using excess deaths and testing statistics to improve estimates of COVID-19 mortalities,"Factors such as non-uniform definitions of mortality, uncertainty in disease prevalence, and biased sampling complicate the quantification of fatality during an epidemic. Regardless of the employed fatality measure, the infected population and the number of infection-caused deaths need to be consistently estimated for comparing mortality across regions. We combine historical and current mortality data, a statistical testing model, and an SIR epidemic model, to improve estimation of mortality. We find that the average excess death across the entire US is 13% higher than the number of reported COVID-19 deaths. In some areas, such as New York City, the number of weekly deaths is about eight times higher than in previous years. Other countries such as Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, and Spain exhibit excess deaths significantly higher than their reported COVID-19 deaths.

13052,A Versatile Web App for Identifying the Drivers of COVID-19 Epidemics,"BackgroundNo versatile web app exists that allows epidemiologists and managers around the world to fully analyze the impacts of COVID-19 mitigation. The NMB-DASA web app presented here fills this gap.

MethodsOur web app uses a model that explicitly identifies a contact class of individuals, symptomatic and asymptomatic classes and a parallel set of response class, subject to lower contact pathogen contact rates. The user inputs a CSV file containing incidence and mortality time series. A default set of parameters is available that can be overwritten through input or online entry, and a subset of these can be fitted to the model using an MLE algorithm. The end of model-fitting and forecasting intervals are specifiable and changes to parameters allows counterfactual and forecasted scenarios to be explored.

FindingsWe illustrate the app in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak in Israel, which can be divided into four distinct phases: an initial outbreak; a social distancing, a social relaxation, and a second wave mitigation phase. Our projections beyond the relaxation phase indicate that an 85% drop in social relaxation rates are needed just to stabilize the current incidence rate and that at least a 95% drop is needed to quell the outbreak.

InterpretationOur analysis uses only incidence and mortality rates. In the hands of policy makers and health officers, we believe our web app provides an invaluable tool for evaluating the impacts of different outbreak mitigation policies and measures.

19772,Determinants of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to guide vaccination strategy in an urban area,"BackgroundTransmission chains within small urban areas (accommodating[~]30% of the European population) greatly contribute to case burden and economic impact during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and should be a focus for preventive measures to achieve containment. Here, at very high spatio-temporal resolution, we analysed determinants of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a European urban area, Basel-City (Switzerland).

MethodsWe combined detailed epidemiological, intra-city mobility, and socioeconomic data-sets with whole-genome-sequencing during the first SARS-CoV-2 wave. For this, we succeeded in sequencing 44% of all reported cases from Basel-City and performed phylogenetic clustering and compartmental modelling based on the dominating viral variant (B.1-C15324T; 60% of cases) to identify drivers and patterns of transmission. Based on these results we simulated vaccination scenarios and corresponding healthcare-system burden (intensive-care-unit occupancy).

FindingsTransmissions were driven by socioeconomically weaker and highly mobile population groups with mostly cryptic transmissions, whereas amongst more senior population transmission was clustered. Simulated vaccination scenarios assuming 60-90% transmission reduction, and 70-90% reduction of severe cases showed that prioritizing mobile, socioeconomically weaker populations for vaccination would effectively reduce case numbers. However, long-term intensive-care-unit occupation would also be effectively reduced if senior population groups were prioritized, provided there were no changes in testing and prevention strategies.

InterpretationReducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission through vaccination strongly depends on the efficacy of the deployed vaccine. A combined strategy of protecting risk groups by extensive testing coupled with vaccination of the drivers of transmission (i.e. highly mobile groups) would be most effective at reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within an urban area. Funding: No dedicated funding was used for this work.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Google Scholar, PubMed, and medRxiv for articles with the keywords  SARS-CoV-2,  transmission,  phylogeny,  city, and  model as of February 2021 and evaluated the relevant abstracts and study details where appropriate. The identified studies predominantly evaluated SARS-CoV-2 transmission within large metropolises with only a few studies reporting on European cities, including analyses of London and Geneva. We noted, that studies (even outside Europe) generally differentiated between either phylogenetic analysis or a dynamic modelling approach and did not combine the two, despite the different aspects described. Moreover, the majority of studies evaluate publicly available data for modelling SARS-CoV-2 transmission and to estimate effective reproductive numbers. Such analyses naturally lack a direct relation of cases and relevant socioeconomic, or geographical information on a per case basis. To date, whole-genome-sequencing information has not been used to clearly identify inherently related cases for modelling transmission behaviour in any of the studies assessed. Finally, of the modelling studies reported, none provided a data-driven estimate of vaccine scenarios in a city, for which all model parameters were identified from the same source.

Added value of this studyIn this comprehensive study we examine SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns within a medium-sized European city. We benefit from a rich data set allowing us to combine phylogenetic clustering with compartmental modelling based exclusively on sequenced and inherently related cases that are mapped to a residential address, and hence coupled with socioeconomic and demographic information. This allows us to evaluate population groups driving SARS-CoV-2 transmission and to quantify relevant effective reproductive numbers. Moreover, we identify both traceable and cryptic transmission chains allowing us to suggest which measures (such as vaccination vs. effective contact tracing) would be most effective for each group.

Implications of all the available evidenceDepending on the specific characteristics of the vaccine, we estimate that vaccination of exclusively the senior population groups will reduce intensive-care-unit occupancy, but overall case number would more effectively be contained by prioritising highly mobile population groups from a socioeconomically weaker background (i.e. transmission drivers), even in the context of comparably shallow socioeconomic gradients within a wealthy European urban area. We identified predominantly clustered transmission amongst more senior or more affluent and less mobile population groups, which implies that extensive testing strategies could be used to more effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission among these groups. By contrast, mobile, low-income population groups were characterized by cryptic transmission. These are very important findings which could be considered in future vaccine prioritization designs for comparable urban areas.","Brueningk, S.

18120,A nanobody-functionalized organic electrochemical transistor for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 or MERS antigens at the physical limit,"The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for rapid protein detection and quantification at the single-molecule level in a format that is simple and robust enough for widespread point-of-care applications. We here introduce a modular nanobody-organic electrochemical transistor architecture that enables the fast and specific detection and quantification of single-molecule to nanomolar protein antigen concentrations in complex bodily fluids. The sensor combines a new solution-processable organic semiconductor material in the transistor channel with the high-density and orientation-controlled bioconjugation of nanobody fusion proteins on disposable gate electrodes. It provides results after a 10 minutes exposure to 5 {micro}L of unprocessed samples, maintains high specificity and single-molecule sensitivity in human saliva or serum, and is rapidly reprogrammed towards any protein target for which nanobodies exist. We demonstrate the use of this highly modular platform for the detection of green fluorescent protein, SARS-CoV-1/2, and MERS-CoV spike proteins and validate the sensor for COVID-19 screening in unprocessed clinical nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples.","Guo, K.; Wustoni, S.; Koklu, A.; Diaz-Galicia, E.; Moser, M.; Hama, A.; Alqahtani, A.

17270,What does the COVID-19 pandemic mean for the next decade of onchocerciasis control and elimination?,"BackgroundMass drug administration (MDA) of ivermectin for onchocerciasis has been disrupted by the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. Mathematical modelling can help predict how missed/delayed MDA will affect short-term epidemiological trends and elimination prospects by 2030.

MethodsTwo onchocerciasis transmission models (EPIONCHO-IBM and ONCHOSIM) are used to simulate microfilarial prevalence trends, elimination probabilities, and age-profiles of Onchocerca volvulus microfilarial prevalence and intensity, for different treatment histories and transmission settings, assuming no interruption, a 1-year (2020) or 2-year (2020-2021) interruption. Biannual MDA or increased coverage upon MDA resumption are investigated as remedial strategies.

ResultsProgrammes with shorter MDA histories and settings with high pre-intervention endemicity will be the most affected. Biannual MDA is more effective than increasing coverage for mitigating COVID-19s impact on MDA. Programmes which had already switched to biannual MDA should be minimally affected. In high transmission settings with short treatment history, a 2-year interruption could lead to increased microfilarial load in children (EPIONCHO-IBM) or adults (ONCHOSIM).

ConclusionsProgrammes with shorter (annual MDA) treatment histories should be prioritised for remedial biannual MDA. Increases in microfilarial load could have short- and long-term morbidity and mortality repercussions. These results can guide decision-making to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on onchocerciasis elimination.","Hamley, J. I. D.; Blok, D. J.; Walker, M.; Milton, P.; Hopkins, A. D.; Hamill, L.

18600,Diagnostic accuracy of two commercial SARS-CoV-2 Antigen-detecting rapid tests at the point of care in community-based testing centers,"BackgroundAntigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 offer new opportunities for the quick and laboratory-independent identification of infected individuals for control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

MethodsWe performed a prospective, single-center, point of care validation of two antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) in comparison to RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs.

FindingsBetween October 9th and 23rd, 2020, 1064 participants were enrolled. The PanbioCovid-19 Ag Rapid Test device (Abbott) was validated in 535 participants, with 106 positive Ag-RDT results out of 124 positive RT-PCR individuals, yielding a sensitivity of 85.5% (95% CI: 78.0-91.2). Specificity was 100.0% (95% CI: 99.1-100) in 411 RT-PCR negative individuals. The Standard Q Ag-RDT (SD Biosensor, Roche) was validated in 529 participants, with 170 positive Ag-RDT results out of 191 positive RT-PCR individuals, yielding a sensitivity of 89.0% (95%CI: 83.7-93.1). One false positive result was obtained in 338 RT-PCR negative individuals, yielding a specificity of 99.7% (95%CI: 98.4-100). For individuals presenting with fever 1-5 days post symptom onset, combined Ag-RDT sensitivity was above 95%.

InterpretationWe provide an independent validation of two widely available commercial Ag-RDTs, both meeting WHO criteria of [&ge;]80% sensitivity and [&ge;]97% specificity. Although less sensitive than RT-PCR, these assays could be beneficial due to their rapid results, ease of use, and independence from existing laboratory structures. Testing criteria focusing on patients with typical symptoms in their early symptomatic period onset could further increase diagnostic value.

16961,"What predicts adherence to COVID-19 government guidelines? Longitudinal analyses of 51,000 UK adults.","In the absence of a vaccine, governments have focused on social distancing, self-isolation, and increased hygiene procedures to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Compliance with these measures requires voluntary cooperation from citizens. Yet, compliance is not complete, and existing studies provide limited understanding of what factors influence compliance; in particular modifiable factors. We use weekly panel data from 51,000 adults across the first three months of lockdown in the UK to identify factors that are related to compliance with COVID-19 guidelines. We find evidence that increased confidence in government to tackle the pandemic is longitudinally related to higher compliance, but little evidence that factors such as mental health and wellbeing, worries about future adversities, and social isolation and loneliness are related to changes in compliance. Our results suggest that to effectively manage the pandemic, governments should ensure that confidence is maintained, something which has not occurred in all countries.","Wright, L.; Steptoe, A.; Fancourt, D.",2020-10-21,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.10.19.20215376,1,Daisy Fancourt,University College London,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.20215376v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.20215376v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
23548,Evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients in outbreak on a cruise ship,"BackgroundA few studies on antibody testing have focused on asymptomatic or mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with low initial anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody responses. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-testing performance was evaluated using blood samples from asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients.

MethodsBlood samples were collected from 143 COVID-19 patients during an outbreak on a cruise ship 3 weeks after diagnosis. Simultaneously, a second SARS-CoV-2 genetic test was performed. Samples stored before the COVID-19 pandemic were also used to evaluate the lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFA) and electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). Titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies against the nucleocapsid and spike proteins were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to compare false-negative- with positive-result samples.

ResultsSensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive, and negative-predictive values of LFA-detected IgM antibodies were 0.231, 1.000, 1.000, and 0.613, respectively; those of LFA-detected IgG antibodies were 0.483, 0.989, 0.972, and 0.601, respectively; and those of ECLIA-detected total antibodies were 0.783, 1.000, 1.000, and 0.848, respectively. IgM-, IgG-, and total-antibody positivity rates in the patients with negative results from the second genetic testing were 22.9%, 47.6%, and 72.4%, respectively. All antibody titers, especially those of the IgG antibody against nucleocapsid protein, were significantly lower in blood samples with false-negative results than in those with positive results.

ConclusionsThese findings suggest that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing has lower performance in asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients than required in the guidelines, and situations in which it is useful are limited.

Key pointsAnti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients is lower than the required clinical sensitivity, although it may be useful in patients at 3-4 weeks after symptom onset but with negative SARS-CoV-2 genetic test results.","Kaku, N.; Nishimura, F.; Shigeishi, Y.; Tachiki, R.; Sakai, H.; Sasaki, D.; Ota, K.; Sakamoto, K.; Kosai, K.; Hasegawa, H.; Izumikawa, K.; Ariyoshi, K.; Mukae, H.; Yasuda, J.; Morita, K.; Kohno, S.; Yanagihara, K.",2021-03-16,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.03.10.21253064,3,Norihito Kaku,Nagasaki University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.10.21253064v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.10.21253064v3.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
11273,Event-specific interventions to minimize COVID-19 transmission,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with over 11 million cases worldwide. Currently there is no treatment and no vaccine. Interventions such as hand washing, masks, social distancing, and """"social bubbles"""" are used to limit community transmission, but it is challenging to choose the best interventions for a given activity. Here, we provide a quantitative framework to determine which interventions are likely to have the most impact in which settings. We introduce the concept of """"event R"""", the expected number of new infections due to the presence of a single infected individual at an event. We obtain a fundamental relationship between event R and four parameters: transmission intensity, duration of exposure, the proximity of individuals, and the degree of mixing. We use reports of small outbreaks to establish event R and transmission intensity in a range of settings. We identify principles that guide whether physical distancing, masks and other barriers to transmission, or social bubbles will be most effective. We outline how this information can be obtained and used to re-open economies with principled measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission.","Tupper, P.; Yerlanov, M.; Boury, H.; Colijn, C.",2020-07-10,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.09.20149435,1,Caroline Colijn,"Simon Fraser University, Imperial College London",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20149435v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20149435v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1073/pnas.2019324117
6415,Safe Blues: A Method for Estimation and Control in the Fight Against COVID-19,"How do fine modifications to social distancing measures really affect COVID-19 spread? A major problem for health authorities is that we do not know.

In an imaginary world, we might develop a harmless biological virus that spreads just like COVID-19, but is traceable via a cheap and reliable diagnosis. By introducing such an imaginary virus into the population and observing how it spreads, we would have a way of learning about COVID-19 because the benign virus would respond to population behaviour and social distancing measures in a similar manner. Such a benign biological virus does not exist. Instead, we propose a safe and privacy-preserving digital alternative.

Our solution is to mimic the benign virus by passing virtual tokens between electronic devices when they move into close proximity. As Bluetooth transmission is the most likely method used for such inter-device communication, and as our suggested """"virtual viruses"""" do not harm individuals software or intrude on privacy, we call these Safe Blues.

In contrast to many app-based methods that inform individuals or governments about actual COVID-19 patients or hazards, Safe Blues does not provide information about individuals locations or contacts. Hence the privacy concerns associated with Safe Blues are much lower than other methods. However, from the point of view of data collection, Safe Blues has two major advantages:

O_LIData about the spread of Safe Blues is uploaded to a central server in real time, which can give authorities a more up-to-date picture in comparison to actual COVID-19 data, which is only available retrospectively.
C_LIO_LISampling of Safe Blues data is not biased by being applied only to people who have shown symptoms or who have come into contact with known positive cases.
C_LI

These features mean that there would be real statistical value in introducing Safe Blues. In the medium term and end game of COVID-19, information from Safe Blues could aid health authorities to make informed decisions with respect to social distancing and other measures.

In this paper we outline the general principles of Safe Blues and we illustrate how Safe Blues data together with neural networks may be used to infer characteristics of the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic in real time.

23189,Longitudinal Analysis Reveals Distinct Antibody and Memory B Cell Responses in SARS-CoV2 Naive and Recovered Individuals Following mRNA Vaccination,"Novel mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV2 have been authorized for emergency use and are currently being administered to millions of individuals worldwide. Despite their efficacy in clinical trials, there is limited data on vaccine-induced immune responses in individuals with a prior SARS-CoV2 infection compared to SARS-CoV2 naive subjects. Moreover, how mRNA vaccines impact the development of antibodies as well as memory B cells in COVID-19 experienced versus COVID-19 naive subjects remains poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated antibody responses and antigen-specific memory B cell responses over time in 33 SARS-CoV2 naive and 11 SARS-CoV2 recovered subjects. mRNA vaccination induced significant antibody and memory B cell responses against full-length SARS-CoV2 spike protein and the spike receptor binding domain (RBD). SARS-CoV2 naive individuals benefitted from both doses of mRNA vaccine with additional increases in antibodies and memory B cells following booster immunization. In contrast, SARS-CoV2 recovered individuals had a significant immune response after the first dose with no increase in circulating antibodies or antigen-specific memory B cells after the second dose. Moreover, the magnitude of the memory B cell response induced by vaccination was lower in older individuals, revealing an age-dependence to mRNA vaccine-induced B cell memory. Side effects also tended to associate with post-boost antibody levels, but not with post-boost memory B cells, suggesting that side effect severity may be a surrogate of short-term antibody responses. The frequency of pre-vaccine antigen-specific memory B cells in SARS-CoV2 recovered individuals strongly correlated with post-vaccine antibody levels, supporting a key role for memory B cells in humoral recall responses to SARS-CoV2. This observation may have relevance for future booster vaccines and for responses to viral variants that partially escape pre-existing antibodies and require new humoral responses to be generated from memory B cells. Finally, post-boost antibody levels were not correlated with post-boost memory responses in SARS-CoV2 naive individuals, indicating that short-term antibody levels and memory B cells are complementary immunological endpoints that should be examined in tandem when evaluating vaccine response. Together, our data provide evidence of both serological response and immunological memory following mRNA vaccination that is distinct based on prior SARS-CoV2 exposure. These findings may inform vaccine distribution in a resource-limited setting.

8364,A systematic review and meta-analysis of cancer patients affected by a novel coronavirus,"BackgroundCancer patients with COVID-19 disease have been reported to have double the case fatality rate of the general population.

Materials and methodsA systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, Google Scholar, and MedRxiv was done for studies on cancer patients with COVID-19. Pooled proportions were calculated for categorical variables.Odds ratio and forest plots were constructed for both primary and secondary outcomes. The random-effects model was used to account for heterogeneity between studies.

ResultsThis systematic review of 31 studies and meta-analysis of 181,323 patients from 26 studies involving 23,736 cancer patients is the largest meta-analysis to the best of our knowledge assessing outcomes in cancer patients affected by COVID-19. Our meta-analysis shows that cancer patients with COVID-19 have a higher likelihood of death (odds ratio, OR 2.54), which was largely driven by mortality among patients in China. Cancer patients were more likely to be intubated, although ICU admission rates were not statistically significant. Among cancer subtypes, the mortality was highest in hematological malignancies (OR 2.43) followed by lung cancer (OR 1.8). There was no association between receipt of a particular type of oncologic therapy and mortality. Our study showed that cancer patients affected by COVID-19 are a decade older than the normal population and have a higher proportion of co-morbidities. There was insufficient data to assess the association of COVID-directed therapy and survival outcomes in cancer patients. Despite the heterogeneity of studies and inconsistencies in reported variables and outcomes, these data could guide clinical practice and oncologic care during this unprecedented global health pandemic.

ConclusionCancer patients with COVID-19 disease are at increased risk of mortality and morbidity. A more nuanced understanding of the interaction between cancer-directed therapies and COVID-19-directed therapies is needed. This will require uniform prospective recording of data, possibly in multi-institutional registry databases.","Venkatesulu, B.

18373,SARS-CoV-2 epidemic after social and economic reopening in three US states reveals shifts in age structure and clinical characteristics,"In the United States, state-level re-openings in spring 2020 presented an opportunity for the resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. One important question during this time was whether human contact and mixing patterns could increase gradually without increasing viral transmission, the rationale being that new mixing patterns would likely be associated with improved distancing, masking, and hygiene practices. A second key question to follow during this time was whether clinical characteristics of the epidemic would improve after the initial surge of cases. Here, we analyze age-structured case, hospitalization, and death time series from three states - Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania - that had successful re-openings in May 2020 without summer waves of infection. Using a Bayesian inference framework on eleven daily data streams and flexible daily population contact parameters, we show that population-average mixing rates dropped by >50% during the lockdown period in March/April, and that the correlation between overall population mobility and transmission-capable mobility was broken in May as these states partially re-opened. We estimate the reporting rates (fraction of symptomatic cases reporting to health system) at 96.0% (RI), 72.1% (MA), and 75.5% (PA); in Rhode Island, when accounting for cases caught through general-population screening programs, the reporting rate estimate is 94.5%. We show that elderly individuals were less able to reduce contacts during the lockdown period when compared to younger individuals, leading to the outbreak being concentrated in elderly congregate settings despite the lockdown. Attack rate estimates through August 31 2020 are 6.4% (95% CI: 5.8% - 7.3%) of the total population infected for Rhode Island, 5.7% (95% CI: 5.0% - 6.8%) in Massachusetts, and 3.7% (95% CI: 3.1% - 4.5%) in Pennsylvania, with some validation available through published seroprevalence studies. Infection fatality rates (IFR) estimates are higher in our analysis (>2%) than previously reported values, likely resulting from the epidemics in these three states affecting the most vulnerable sub-populations, especially the most vulnerable of the [&ge;]80 age group.

18704,The Contrasting Role of Nasopharyngeal Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) Expression in SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Cross-Sectional Study of People Tested for COVID-19 in British Columbia,"BackgroundAngiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as the host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, with a critical role in viral infection. We aim to understand population level variation of nasopharyngeal ACE2 expression in people tested for COVID-19 and the relationship between ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load, while adjusting for expression of the complementary protease, Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), soluble ACE2, age, and biological sex.

MethodsA cross-sectional study of n=424 participants aged 1-104 years referred for COVID-19 testing was performed in British Columbia, Canada. Participants who tested negative or positive for COVID-19 were matched by age and biological sex. Viral and host gene expression was measured by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Bivariate analysis and multiple linear regression were performed to understand the role of nasopharyngeal ACE2 expression in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ACE2 gene was targeted to measure expression of transmembrane and soluble transcripts.

FindingsAnalysis shows no association between age and nasopharyngeal ACE2 expression in those who tested negative for COVID-19 (P=0{middle dot}092). Mean expression of transmembrane (P=1{middle dot}2e-4), soluble ACE2 (P<0{middle dot}0001) and TMPRSS2 (P<0{middle dot}0001) differed between COVID-19-negative and -positive groups. In bivariate analysis of COVID-19-positive participants, expression of transmembrane ACE2 positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral load (P<0{middle dot}0001), expression of soluble ACE2 negatively correlated (P<0{middle dot}0001), and no correlation was found with TMPRSS2 (P=0{middle dot}694). Multivariable analysis showed that the greatest viral RNA loads were observed in participants with high transmembrane ACE2 expression (B=0{middle dot}886, 95%CI:[0{middle dot}596 to 1{middle dot}18]), while expression of soluble ACE2 may protect against high viral RNA load in the upper respiratory tract (B= -0{middle dot}0990, 95%CI:[-0{middle dot}176 to -0{middle dot}0224]).

InterpretationNasopharyngeal ACE2 expression plays a dual, contrasting role in SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper respiratory tract. Transmembrane ACE2 positively correlates, while soluble ACE2 negatively correlates with viral RNA load after adjusting for age, biological sex and expression of TMPRSS2.

3480,Covid-19 Outbreak Progression in Italian Regions: Approaching the Peak by March 29th,"BackgroundItaly and especially the Lombardy region is experiencing a heavy burden of Covid-19 infection. The peak of the epidemics has not yet been reached and it is expected to be delayed in Central and Southern Italian regions compared to Northern ones. We have modeled the Covid-19 outbreak progression in Italian Regions vs. Lombardy.

MethodsIn our models, we have estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) -which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection - both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period and also by using day by day assessment, based on single observations. We used the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading of the pandemic in Italy.

ResultsThe two methods provide agreements of values, although the first method based on exponential fit should provide a better estimation, being computed on the entire time series. Taking into account the growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period, in Lombardy each infected person has involved other 5 people (4.94 base on data of March 22nd vs. 5.07 based on data of March 19th) compared to a value of R0 = 2.68 reported in the Chinese city of Whuan. According to our model and Piedmont, Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Marche reach an R0 value up to 4. The R0 is 3.7 for Lazio and 3.6 for Campania region, where this latter shows the highest value among the Southern Italian regions, followed by Apulia (3.5), Sicily (3.4), Abruzzo (3.4), Calabria (3.1), Basilicata (2.5) and Molise (2.4). The value of R0 is decreasing in Lombardy and Northern Regions, while it is increasing in Central and Southern Regions.

ConclusionThe expected peak of SEIR model can be forecast by the last week of March at national level, and by the first weeks of April in Southern Italian Regions. These kind of models can be useful for adoption of all the possible preventive measures, and to assess the epidemics progression across Southern regions as opposed to the Northern ones.","Distante, C.; Piscitelli, P.; Miani, A.",2020-04-02,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.03.30.20043612,1,Cosimo Distante,"CNR ISASI, Institute of Applied Sciences and Intelligence Systems, Lecce, Italy",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20043612v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20043612v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
18294,Dysregulated immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women,"ImportanceThe effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on immune responses during pregnancy have not been systematically evaluated.

ObjectiveTo assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on inflammatory and humoral responses in maternal and fetal samples and compare antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 among pregnant and non-pregnant women.

DesignImmune responses to SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed using samples from pregnant and non-pregnant women who had either tested positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2. We measured, proinflammatory and placental cytokine mRNAs, neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) receptor expression, and tetanus antibody transfer in maternal and cord blood samples. Additionally, we measured anti-spike (S) IgG, anti-S-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, and neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses to SARS-CoV-2 in serum or plasma collected from non-pregnant women, pregnant women, and cord blood.

SettingJohns Hopkins Hospital (JHH)

ParticipantsPregnant women were recruited through JHH outpatient obstetric clinics and the JHH Labor & Delivery unit. Non-pregnant women were recruited after receiving outpatient SARS-CoV-2 testing within Johns Hopkins Health System, USA. Adult non-pregnant women with positive RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2, within the age range of 18-48 years, were included in the study.

ExposuresSARS-CoV-2

Main Outcomes and MeasuresParticipant demographic characteristics, antibody titers, cytokine mRNA expression, and FcRn receptor expression.

ResultsSARS-COV-2 positive pregnant women expressed more IL1{beta}, but not IL6, in blood samples collected within 14 days versus > 14 days after a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 test, with similar patterns observed in the fetal side of placentas, particularly among asymptomatic pregnant women. Pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection also had reduced anti-S-RBD IgG titers and were less likely to have detectable nAb as compared with non-pregnant women. Although SARS-CoV-2 infection did not disrupt FcRn expression in the placenta, maternal transfer of nAb was inhibited by SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy.

Conclusions and RelevanceSARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy was characterized by placental inflammation and reduced antiviral antibody responses, which may impact the efficacy of COVID-19 therapeutics in pregnancy. The long-term implications of placental inflammation for neonatal health also requires greater consideration.","Sherer, M.

11738,Progressive worsening of the respiratory and gut microbiome in children during the first two months of COVID-19,"Children are less susceptible to COVID-19 and manifests lower morbidity and mortality after infection, for which a multitude of mechanisms may be proposed. Whether the normal development of gut-airway microbiome is affected by COVID-19 has not been evaluated. We demonstrate that COVID-19 alters the respiratory and gut microbiome of children. Alteration of the microbiome was divergent between the respiratory tract and gut, albeit the dysbiosis was dominated by genus Pseudomonas and sustained for up to 25-58 days in different individuals. The respiratory microbiome distortion persisted in 7/8 children for at least 19-24 days after discharge from the hospital. The gut microbiota showed early dysbiosis towards later restoration in some children, but not others. Disturbed development of both gut and respiratory microbiomes, and prolonged respiratory dysbiosis in children imply possible long-term complications after clinical recovery from COVID-19, such as predisposition to an increased health risk in the post-COVID-19 era.","Xu, R.; Liu, P.; Zhang, T.; Wu, Q.; Zeng, M.; Ma, Y.; Jin, X.; Xu, J.; Zhang, Z.; Zhang, C.",2020-07-17,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.07.13.20152181,1,Chiyu Zhang,Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152181v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152181v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

The methodology allowed us to estimate that the maximum limit for the total number of cases of COVID-19 patients such as those registered with the World Health Organization will be approximately one million and one hundred thousand cases to the United States. Up to 04/19/20 the models indicate that United States reached 70% of this maximum number of """"total cases"""" and the United States will reach 95% of this limit by 05/14/2020.

12301,Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 with Waning Immunity in the UK Population,"The dynamics of immunity are crucial to understanding the long-term patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Several cases of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 have been documented 48-142 days after the initial infection and immunity to seasonal circulating coronaviruses is estimated to be shorter than one year. Using an age-structured, deterministic model, we explore potential immunity dynamics using contact data from the UK population. In the scenario where immunity to SARS-CoV-2 lasts an average of three months for non-hospitalised individuals, a year for hospitalised individuals, and the effective reproduction number after lockdown ends is 1.2 (our worst case scenario), we find that the secondary peak occurs in winter 2020 with a daily maximum of 387,000 infectious individuals and 125,000 daily new cases; three-fold greater than in a scenario with permanent immunity. Our models suggests that longitudinal serological surveys to determine if immunity in the population is waning will be most informative when sampling takes place from the end of the lockdown in June until autumn 2020. After this period, the proportion of the population with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is expected to increase due to the secondary wave. Overall, our analysis presents considerations for policy makers on the longer term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK and suggests that strategies designed to achieve herd immunity may lead to repeated waves of infection as immunity to reinfection is not permanent.","Crellen, T.; Pi, L.; Davis, E.; Pollington, T.

14506,The impact of high frequency rapid viral antigen screening on COVID-19 spread and outcomes: a validation and modeling study,"High frequency screening of populations has been proposed as a strategy in facilitating control of the COVID-19 pandemic. We use computational modeling, coupled with clinical data from rapid antigen tests, to predict the impact of frequent viral antigen rapid testing on COVID-19 spread and outcomes. Using patient nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens, we demonstrate that the sensitivity/specificity of two rapid antigen tests compared to quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) are 82.0%/100% and 84.7%/85.7%, respectively; moreover, sensitivity correlates directly with viral load. Based on COVID-19 data from three regions in the United States and Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Brazil, we show that high frequency, strategic population-wide rapid testing, even at varied accuracy levels, diminishes COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths at a fraction of the cost of nucleic acid detection via qRT-PCR. We propose large-scale antigen-based surveillance as a viable strategy to control SARS-CoV-2 spread and to enable societal re-opening.","Nash, B.; Badea, A.; Reddy, A.; Bosch, M.; Salcedo, N.; Gomez, A.

We propose a fractal dynamical model using conformed derivative and fractal time scale. A Burr-XII shaped solution of the fractal-like equation is obtained.

The diverse behavior of the outbreak on those countries is presented and discussed.

8827,Repurposed prophylaxis strategies for COVID-19: a systematic review,"IntroductionEfficient therapeutic strategies are needed to counter the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARSCoV-2 virus. In a context where specific vaccines are not yet available, the containment of the pandemic would be facilitated with efficient prophylaxis.

MethodsWe screened several clinical trials repositories and platforms in search of the prophylactic strategies that are investigated against COVID-19 in late April 2020.

ResultsUp to April 27, 2020, we found 68 clinical trials targeting medical workers (n = 43, 63%), patients relatives (n = 16, 24%) or individuals at risk of severe COVID-19 (n = 5, 7%). (Hydroxy)chloroquine was the most frequently evaluated treatment (n = 46, 68%), before BCG vaccine (n = 5, 7%). Sixty-one (90%) clinical trials were randomized with a median of planned inclusions of 600 (IQR 255-1515).

ConclusionThe investigated prophylaxis strategies cover both pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis and study numerous immune enhancers and antivirals, although most research efforts are focused on (hydroxy)chloroquine.","Sallard, E.; Lescure, F.-X.; Burdet, C.; Guedj, J.; Yazdanpanah, Y.; Peiffer-Smadja, N.",2020-06-03,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.30.20117937,1,Nathan Peiffer-Smadja,"Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM, F-75018, Paris, France; Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat- Clau",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.30.20117937v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.30.20117937v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
6434,"Risk of secondary infection waves of COVID-19 in an insular region: the case of the Balearic Islands, Spain","The Spanish government declared the lockdown on March 14th, 2020 to tackle the fast-spreading of COVID-19. As a consequence the Balearic Islands remained almost fully isolated due to the closing of airports and ports, These isolation measures and the home-based confinement have led to a low prevalence of COVID-19 in this region. We propose a compartmental model for the spread of COVID-19 including five compartments (Susceptible, Latent, Infected, Diseased, and Recovered), and the mobility between municipalities. The model parameters are calibrated with the temporal series of confirmed cases provided by the Spanish Ministry of Health. After calibration, the proposed model captures the trend of the official confirmed cases before and after the lockdown. We show that the estimated number of cases depends strongly on the initial dates of the local outbreak onset and the number of imported cases before the lockdown. Our estimations indicate that the population has not reached the level of herd immunization necessary to prevent future outbreaks. While the low prevalence, in comparison to mainland Spain, has prevented the saturation of the health system, this low prevalence translates into low immunization rates, therefore facilitating the propagation of new outbreaks that could lead to secondary waves of COVID-19 in the region. These findings warn about scenarios regarding after-lockdown-policies and the risk of second outbreaks, emphasize the need for widespread testing, and could potentially be extrapolated to other insular and continental regions.","Eguiluz, V.

22362,Artificial Intelligence Applications for COVID-19 in Intensive Care and Emergency Settings: A Systematic Review,"BackgroundLittle is known about the role of artificial intelligence (AI) as a decisive technology in the clinical management of COVID-19 patients. We aimed to systematically review and critically appraise the current evidence on AI applications for COVID-19 in intensive care and emergency settings, focusing on methods, reporting standards, and clinical utility.

MethodsWe systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library databases from inception to 1 October 2020, without language restrictions. We included peer-reviewed original studies that applied AI for COVID-19 patients, healthcare workers, or health systems in intensive care, emergency or prehospital settings. We assessed predictive modelling studies using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool) and a modified TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) statement for AI. We critically appraised the methodology and key findings of all other studies.

ResultsOf fourteen eligible studies, eleven developed prognostic or diagnostic AI predictive models, all of which were assessed to be at high risk of bias. Common pitfalls included inadequate sample sizes, poor handling of missing data, failure to account for censored participants, and weak validation of models. Studies had low adherence to reporting guidelines, with particularly poor reporting on model calibration and blinding of outcome and predictor assessment. Of the remaining three studies, two evaluated the prognostic utility of deep learning-based lung segmentation software and one studied an AI-based system for resource optimisation in the ICU. These studies had similar issues in methodology, validation, and reporting.

ConclusionsCurrent AI applications for COVID-19 are not ready for deployment in acute care settings, given their limited scope and poor quality. Our findings underscore the need for improvements to facilitate safe and effective clinical adoption of AI applications, for and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chee, M. L.; Ong, M. E.

8119,SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in blood samples from patients with COVID-19 is not associated with infectious virus,"BackgroundLaboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (the cause of COVID-19) uses PCR to detect viral RNA (vRNA) in respiratory samples. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in other sample types, but there is limited understanding of the clinical or laboratory significance of its detection in blood.

MethodsWe undertook a systematic literature review to assimilate the evidence for the frequency of vRNA in blood, and to identify associated clinical characteristics. We performed RT-PCR in serum samples from a UK clinical cohort of acute and convalescent COVID-19 cases (n=212), together with convalescent plasma samples collected by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) (n=111 additional samples). To determine whether PCR-positive blood samples could pose an infection risk, we attempted virus isolation from a subset of RNA-positive samples.

ResultsWe identified 28 relevant studies, reporting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 0-76% of blood samples; pooled estimate 10% (95%CI 5-18%). Among serum samples from our clinical cohort, 27/212 (12.7%) had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by RT-PCR. RNA detection occurred in samples up to day 20 post symptom onset, and was associated with more severe disease (multivariable odds ratio 7.5). Across all samples collected [&ge;]28 days post symptom onset, 0/143 (0%, 95%CI 0.0-2.5%) had vRNA detected. Among our PCR-positive samples, cycle threshold (ct) values were high (range 33.5-44.8), suggesting low vRNA copy numbers. PCR-positive sera inoculated into cell culture did not produce any cytopathic effect or yield an increase in detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

ConclusionsvRNA was detectable at low viral loads in a minority of serum samples collected in acute infection, but was not associated with infectious SARS-CoV-2 (within the limitations of the assays used). This work helps to inform biosafety precautions for handling blood products from patients with current or previous COVID-19.","Andersson, M.; Arancibia - Carcamo, C. V.; Auckland, K.; Baillie, J.

MethodsA descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted. Disease surveillance focal persons were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaire on the system operations and use of Measles case definitions. Measles case-based investigation forms from 2015 - 2020 were reviewed for its timeliness and data quality. CDC updated guidelines for surveillance system evaluation was used to assess its usefulness and attributes. Data was analyzed for frequencies and proportions and results presented in tables and graphs.

ResultsMeasles surveillance system was timely as 100% (69/69) of the suspected cases were reported on time. Also, the level of representativeness was good as all the 14 health facilities in the District were participating in the Measles Surveillance system.

2977,A model to estimate bed demand for COVID-19 related hospitalization,"As of March 23, 2020 there have been over 354,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in over 180 countries, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic, and the United States (US) announced a national state of emergency.1, 2, 3 In parts of China and Italy the demand for intensive care (IC) beds was higher than the number of available beds.4, 5 We sought to build an accessible interactive model that could facilitate hospital capacity planning in the presence of significant uncertainty about the proportion of the population that is COVID-19+ and the rate at which COVID-19 is spreading in the population. Our approach was to design a tool with parameters that hospital leaders could adjust to reflect their local data and easily modify to conduct sensitivity analyses.

We developed a model to facilitate hospital planning with estimates of the number of Intensive Care (IC) beds, Acute Care (AC) beds, and ventilators necessary to accommodate patients who require hospitalization for COVID-19 and how these compare to the available resources. Inputs to the model include estimates of the characteristics of the patient population and hospital capacity. We deployed this model as an interactive online tool.6 The model is implemented in R 3.5, RStudio, RShiny 1.4.0 and Python 3.7. The parameters used may be modified as data become available, for use at other institutions, and to generate sensitivity analyses.

We illustrate the use of the model by estimating the demand generated by COVID-19+ arrivals for a hypothetical acute care medical center. The model calculated that the number of patients requiring an IC bed would equal the number of IC beds on Day 23, the number of patients requiring a ventilator would equal the number of ventilators available on Day 27, and the number of patients requiring an AC bed and coverage by the Medicine Service would equal the capacity of the Medicine service on Day 21.

In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, hospitals must understand their current and future capacity to care for patients with severe illness. While there is significant uncertainty around the parameters used to develop this model, the analysis is based on transparent logic and starts from observed data to provide a robust basis of projections for hospital managers. The model demonstrates the need and provides an approach to address critical questions about staffing patterns for IC and AC, and equipment capacity such as ventilators.","Zhang, T.; Mcfarlane, K.; Vallon, J.; Yang, L.; Xie, J.; Blanchet, J.; Glynn, P.; Staudenmayer, K.; Schulman, K.; Scheinker, D.",2020-03-26,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.24.20042762,1,David Scheinker,"Stanford University School of Engineering, Stanford University School of Medicine, Lucile Packard Children\'s Hospital",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042762v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042762v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
23667,SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION OF COVID-19 MITIGATION (SOCOM): ASSESSING FACE COVERING AND DISTANCING IN SCHOOLS,"IntroductionDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, some K-12 schools resumed in-person classes with varying degrees of mitigation plans in the fall of 2020. Physical distancing and face coverings can minimize SARS-CoV-2 spread, the virus that causes COVID-19. However, no research has focused on mitigation strategy adherence during school days. Thus, we sought to develop a systematic observation protocol to capture COVID-19 mitigation strategy adherence in school environments: The Systematic Observation of COVID-19 Mitigation (SOCOM).

MethodsWe extended previously validated and internationally used tools to develop the SOCOM training and implementation protocol to assess physical distancing and face covering behaviors. SOCOM was tested in diverse indoor and outdoor settings (classrooms, lunchrooms, physical education [PE], and recess) among diverse schools (elementary, secondary, and special needs).

ResultsFor the unique metrics of physical-distancing and face-covering behaviors, areas with more activity and a maximum of 10-15 students were ideal for accurately capturing data. Overall proportion of agreement was high for physical distancing (90.9%), face covering (88.6%), activity type (89.2%), and physical activity level (87.9%). Agreement was lowest during active recess, PE, and observation areas with [&ge;]20 students.

ConclusionsMillions of children throughout the US are likely to return to school in the months ahead despite the current surge of COVID-19 cases. SOCOM is a relatively inexpensive tool that can be implemented by schools to determine mitigation strategy adherence and assess changes to protocols to help students return to school safely and slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be used for research purposes.","Camplain, R.; Lopez, N.

18418,"The decrease in hospitalizations for transient ischemic attack and ischemic stroke, especially in mild cases, during the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan.","Background and PurposeThe epidemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected health care systems globally. The aim of our study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on hospital admissions for stroke in Japan.

MethodsWe analyzed administrative (Diagnosis Procedure Combination) data for cases of inpatients aged 18 years and older who were diagnosed with stroke (ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), hemorrhagic stroke, or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)) and discharged from hospital during the period July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2020. The number of patients with each stroke diagnosis, various patient characteristics, and treatment approaches were compared before and after the epidemic. Changes in the trend of the monthly number of inpatients with each stroke diagnosis were assessed using interrupted time-series analyses.

ResultsA total of 111,922 cases (ischemic stroke: 74,897 cases; TIA: 5,374 cases; hemorrhagic stroke: 24,779 cases; SAH: 6,872 cases) in 253 hospitals were included. The number of cases for all types of stroke decreased (ischemic stroke: -13.9%; TIA: -21.4%; hemorrhagic stroke: -9.9%; SAH: -15.2%) in April and May 2020, compared to the number of cases in 2019. Ischemic stroke and TIA cases, especially mild cases (modified Rankin Scale = 0), decreased, with a statistically significant change in trend between the before- and after-epidemic periods.

ConclusionsThese data showed a marked reduction in the number of hospital admissions due to stroke during the COVID-19 epidemic. The change in Ischemic stroke and TIA cases, especially mild cases, was statistically significant.","Nagano, H.; Takada, D.; Shin, J.-H.; Morishita, T.; Kunisawa, S.; Imanaka, Y.",2020-11-18,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.11.17.20233692,1,Yuichi Imanaka,"Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.17.20233692v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.17.20233692v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
15370,How the clinical research community responded to the COVID-19 pandemic: An analysis of the COVID-19 clinical studies in ClinicalTrials.gov,"ObjectiveThe novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), broke out in December 2019, is a global pandemic. Rapidly in the past few months, a large number of clinical studies have been initiated worldwide to find effective therapeutics, vaccines, and preventive strategies. In this study, we aim to understand the landscape of COVID-19 clinical research and identify the gaps and issues that may cause difficulty in recruitment and the lack of population representativeness.

Materials and MethodsWe analyzed 2,034 COVID-19 studies registered in the largest public registry - ClinicalTrials.gov. Leveraging natural language processing, descriptive analysis, association analysis, and clustering analysis, we characterized COVID-19 clinical studies by phase and design features. Particularly, we analyzed their eligibility criteria to understand: (1) whether they considered the reported underlying health conditions that may lead to severe illnesses, and (2) if these studies excluded older adults, either explicitly or implicitly, which may reduce the generalizability of these studies in older adults.

ResultsThe 5 most frequently tested drugs are Hydroxychloroquine (N=148), Azithromycin (N=46), Tocilizumab (N=29), Lopinavir (N=20), and Ritonavir (N=20). Most trials did not have an upper age limit and did not exclude patients with common chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes that are prevalent in older adults. However, known risk factors that may lead to severe illnesses have not been adequately considered by existing studies.

ConclusionsA careful examination of the registered COVID-19 clinical studies can identify the research gaps and inform future COVID-19 trial design towards balanced internal validity and generalizability.","He, Z.; Erdengasileng, A.; Luo, X.; Xing, A.; Charness, N.; Bian, J.",2020-12-15,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.09.16.20195552,3,Zhe He,Florida State University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.16.20195552v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.16.20195552v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1093/jamiaopen/ooab032
21751,Genetic determination of regional connectivity in modelling the spread of COVID-19 outbreak for improved mitigation strategies,"Covid-19 has resulted in the death of more than 1,500,000 individuals. Due to the pandemics severity, thousands of genomes have been sequenced and publicly stored with extensive records, an unprecedented amount of data for an outbreak in a single year. Simultaneously, prediction models offered region-specific and often contradicting results, while states or countries implemented mitigation strategies with little information on success, precision, or agreement with neighboring regions. Even though viral transmissions have been already documented in a historical and geographical context, few studies aimed to model geographic and temporal flow from viral sequence information. Here, using a case study of 7 states, we model the flow of the Covid-19 outbreak with respect to phylogenetic information, viral migration, inter- and intra- regional connectivity, epidemiologic and demographic characteristics. By assessing regional connectivity from genomic variants, we can significantly improve predictions in modeling the viral spread and intensity.

Contrary to previous results, our study shows that the vast majority of the first outbreak can be traced to very few lineages, despite the existence of multiple worldwide transmissions. Moreover, our results show that while the distance from hotspots is initially important, connectivity becomes increasingly significant as the virus establishes itself. Similarly, isolated local strategies-such as relying on herd immunity-can negatively impact neighboring states. Our work suggests that we can achieve more efficient unified mitigation strategies with selective interventions.","Salichos, L.; Warrell, J.; Cevasco, H.; Chung, A.; Gerstein, M.",2021-02-02,Health Informatics,10.1101/2021.01.30.21250785,1,Leonidas Salichos,New York Institute of Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.30.21250785v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.30.21250785v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
5718,Clinical presentation and evolution of COVID-19 in immunosuppressed patients. Preliminary evaluation in a North Italian cohort on calcineurin-inhibitors based therapy,"The clinical course of COVID-19 in patients undergoing chronic immunosuppressive therapy is yet poorly known. We performed a monocentric cross-sectional study describing the clinical course of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients from northern Italy treated with calcineurin-inhibitors for organ transplantation or rheumatic diseases. Data were collected by phone call and clinical chart review between March 27th- 31st 2020. COVID-19 related symptoms, rynopharingeal swab, therapeutic changes and outcome were assessed in 384 consecutive patients (57% males; median age 61 years, IQR 48-69). 331 patients (86%) received solid organ transplantation (kidney n=140, 36%, heart n=100, 26%, lung n=91, 24%) and 53 (14%) had a rheumatic disease. Calcineurin inhibitors were the only immunosuppressant administered in 46 patients (12%). 14 patients developed a """"confirmed COVID-19"""" (swab positivity) and 14 a """"clinical COVID-19"""" (only typical symptoms). Fever (75%) and diarrhoea (50%) were the most common symptoms. Fourteen patients were hospitalized and 11 have already been dismissed. No patient required start/changes of the O2 therapy or developed superinfection. Only one patient, with metastatic lung cancer, died. In conclusion, COVID-19 showed a mild course in our cohort, with low mortality. Calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppressive regimens appear safe in this context and should not be discontinued.","Cavagna, L.; Bruno, R.; Zanframundo, G.; Gregorini, M.; Seminari, E.; Di Matteo, A.; Rampino, T.; Montecucco, C.; Pelenghi, S.; Cattadori, B.; Pattoneri, E.

2040,Evaluating the impact of international airline suspensions on theearly global spread of COVID-19,"Global airline networks play a key role in the global importation of emerging infectious diseases. Detailed information on air traffic between international airports has been demonstrated to be useful in retrospectively validating and prospectively predicting case emergence in other countries. In this paper, we use a well-established metric known as effective distance on the global air traffic data from IATA to quantify risk of emergence for different countries as a consequence of direct importation from China, and compare it against arrival times for the first 24 countries. Using this model trained on official first reports from WHO, we estimate time of arrival (ToA) for all other countries. We then incorporate data on airline suspensions to recompute the effective distance and assess the effect of such cancellations in delaying the estimated arrival time for all other countries. Finally we use the infectious disease vulnerability indices to explain some of the estimated reporting delays.","Adiga, A.; Venkatramanan, S.; Schlitt, J.; Peddireddy, A.; Dickerman, A.; Bura, A.; Warren, A.; Klahn, B.

20962,Detection of SARS-Cov-2 RNA in serum is associated with increased mortality risk in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.,"BackgroundCOVID-19 has overloaded national health services worldwide. Thus, early identification of patients at risk of poor outcomes is critical. Our objective was to analyse SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in serum as a severity biomarker in COVID-19.

Methods and FindingsRetrospective observational study including 193 patients admitted for COVID-19. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum (CoVemia) was performed with samples collected at 48-72 hours of admission by two techniques from Roche and Thermo Fischer Scientific (TFS). Main outcome variables were mortality and need for ICU admission during hospitalization for COVID-19.

CoVemia was detected in 50-60% of patients depending on technique. The correlation of Ct in serum between both techniques was good (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.612; p < 0.001). Patients with CoVemia were older (p = 0.006), had poorer baseline oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2; p < 0.001), more severe lymphopenia (p < 0.001) and higher LDH (p < 0.001), IL-6 (p = 0.021), C-reactive protein (CRP; p = 0.022) and procalcitonin (p = 0.002) serum levels.

We defined """"relevant CoVemia"""" when detection Ct was < 34 with Roche and < 31 for TFS. These thresholds had 95% sensitivity and 35 % specificity. Relevant CoVemia predicted death during hospitalization (OR 9.2 [3.8 - 22.6] for Roche, OR 10.3 [3.6 - 29.3] for TFS; p < 0.001). Cox regression models, adjusted by age, sex and Charlson index, identified increased LDH serum levels and relevant CoVemia (HR = 9.87 [4.13-23.57] for TFS viremia and HR = 7.09 [3.3-14.82] for Roche viremia) as the best markers to predict mortality.

ConclusionsCoVemia assessment at admission is the most useful biomarker for predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients. CoVemia is highly reproducible with two different techniques (TFS and Roche), has a good consistency with other severity biomarkers for COVID-19 and better predictive accuracy.

AUTHOR SUMMARYCOVID-19 shows a very heterogeneous clinical picture. In addition, it has overloaded national health services worldwide. Therefore, early identification of patients with poor prognosis is critical to improve the use of limited health resources. In this work, we evaluated whether baseline SARS-CoV2 RNA detection in blood (CoVemia) is associated with worse outcomes. We studied almost 200 patients admitted to our hospital and about 50-60% of them showed positive CoVemia. Patients with positive CoVemia were older and had more severe disease; CoVemia was also more frequent in patients requiring admission to the ICU. Moreover, we defined """"relevant CoVemia"""", as the amount of viral load that better predicted mortality obtaining 95% sensitivity and 35% specificity. In addition, relevant CoVemia was a better predictor than other biomarkers such as LDH, lymphocyte count, interleukin-6, and indexes used in ICU such as qSOFA and CURB65.

In summary, detection of CoVemia is the best biomarker to predict death in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, it is easy to be implemented and is reproducible with two techniques (Roche and Thermo Fisher Scientific) that are currently used for diagnosis in nasopharyngeal swabs samples.","Rodriguez Serrano, D.

13520,Forecasting American COVID-19 Cases and Deaths through Machine Learning,"COVID-19 has become a great national security problem for the United States and many other countries, where public policy and healthcare decisions are based on the several models for the prediction of the future deaths and cases of COVID-19. While the most commonly used models for COVID-19 include epidemiological models and Gaussian curve-fitting models, recent literature has indicated that these models could be improved by incorporating machine learning. However, within this research on potential machine learning models for COVID-19 forecasting, there has been a large emphasis on providing an array of different types of machine learning models rather than optimizing a single one. In this research, we suggest and optimize a linear machine learning model with a gradient-based optimizer for the prediction of future COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States. We also suggest that a hybrid of a machine learning model for shorter range predictions and a Gaussian curve-fitting model or an epidemiological model for longer range predictions could greatly increase the accuracy of COVID-19 forecasting.","Somalwar, A.",2020-08-16,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.08.13.20174631,2,Anaiy Somalwar,BASIS Independent Silicon Valley,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20174631v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20174631v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
17459,Features of creatine-kinase in COVID-19 patients within various specific periods: A cohort study,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared as a threat to the global. Due to the lack of efficient treatments, indicators were urgently needed during the evolvement of disease to analyze the illness and prognosis, and prevent the aggravation of COVID-19.

MethodsPatients general information, clinical type, all CK values and outcome were collected. CK value of all cases during disease course started from different initial time were analyzed.

ResultsAll cases underwent 504 tests of CK since symptom onset and the median value was 51.7 (35.0-91.5) U/L. The first median value on the day 8 from exposure onset was 78.1 (69.1-85.8) U/L then showed an upward trend from the day 8 to the day 12 (reaching a peak of 279.3 U/L), finally showed a fluctuation decline after the day 12. The CK median value in critical cases reached the peak (625.5 U/L) on the transforming date, and then decreased rapidly to the normal range. Before death, the CK median value in dead cases firstly increased until the day -14 with a peak as 470.0 U/L, then decreased with fluctuation until day -2, and finally increased again on the day 0.

ConclusionsCK reached its peak on the day when it became critical type, dynamic detection of CK can guide clinical judgment of prognosis. The increase of CK is a high risk factor of death. Severe cell damage 2 weeks before death might determines the outcome of the disease even if CK drops to the normal range afterward.","Wan, S.; Qu, G.; Yu, H.; Zhu, H.; Huang, G.; Chen, L.; Zhang, M.; Liu, J.; Pei, B.",2020-11-01,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.28.20221119,1,Bin Pei,"Center of Evidence-based Medicine, Xiangyang No.1 People\'s Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine, Xiangyang 441000, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.28.20221119v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.28.20221119v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

We revisit several variants of the SEIR-model and investigate various adjustments to the model in order to achieve output consistent with measured data in Manaus, India and Stockholm. In particular, Stockholm is interesting due to the almost constant NPIs, which substantially simplifies the mathematical modeling. Analyzing mobility data for Stockholm, we argue that neither behavioral changes, age and activity stratification nor NPIs alone are sufficient to explain the observed pandemic progression.

21018,Sleeping under the waves: a longitudinal study across the contagion peaks of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy,"After the March-April 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, a second contagion wave afflicted Europe in autumn. This study aimed to evaluate sleep health/patterns of Italians during this further challenging situation.

A total of 2013 Italians longitudinally participated in a web-based survey during the two contagion peaks of the COVID-19 outbreak. We investigated the risk factors for sleep disturbances during the second wave, and we compared sleep quality and psychological well-being between the two assessments (March-April and November-December 2020). Female gender, low education, evening chronotype, being at high-risk for COVID-19 infection, reporting negative social or economic impact, and evening smartphone overuse predicted a higher risk of poor sleep and insomnia symptoms during the second wave. Advanced age, living with high-risk subjects for COVID-19 infection, and having a relative/friend infected with COVID-19 before the prior two weeks were risk categories for poor sleep quality. Living with children, having contracted COVID-19 before the prior two weeks, being pessimistic on the vaccine, and working in healthcare were risk factors for insomnia symptoms. The follow-up assessment highlighted reduced insomnia symptoms and anxiety. Nevertheless, we showed reduced sleep duration, higher daytime dysfunction and sleep medication use, and advanced sleep phase, confirming the alarming prevalence of poor sleepers ([~]60%) and severe depression ([~]20%) in a context of increased perceived stress.

This study demonstrated a persistent impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep and mental health.

An analysis on a population-based sample in a high exposure setting,"BackgroundPerformance of three automated commercial serological IgG-based assays was investigated for assessing SARS-CoV-2 ever (past or current) infection in a population-based sample in a high exposure setting.

MethodsPCR and serological testing was performed on 394 individuals.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2-IgG seroprevalence was 42.9% (95% CI 38.1%-47.8%), 40.6% (95% CI 35.9%-45.5%), and 42.4% (95% CI 37.6%-47.3%) using the CL-900i, VidasIII, and Elecsys assays, respectively. Between the three assays, overall, positive, and negative percent agreements ranged between 93.2%-95.7%, 89.3%-92.8%, and 93.8%-97.8%, respectively; Cohen kappa statistic ranged from 0.86-0.91; and 35 specimens (8.9%) showed discordant results. Among all individuals, 12.5% (95% CI 9.6%-16.1%) had current infection, as assessed by PCR. Of these, only 34.7% (95% CI 22.9%-48.7%) were seropositive by at least one assay. A total of 216 individuals (54.8%; 95% CI 49.9%-59.7%) had evidence of ever infection using antibody testing and/or PCR during or prior to this study. Of these, only 78.2%, 74.1%, and 77.3% were seropositive in the CL-900i, VidasIII, and Elecsys assays, respectively.

ConclusionsAll three assays had comparable performance and excellent agreement, but missed at least 20% of individuals with past or current infection.

24200,Vascular Comorbidities Worsen Prognosis of Patients with Heart Failure Hospitalized with COVID-19,"BackgroundPrior diagnosis of heart failure (HF) is associated with increased length of hospital stay (LOS) and mortality from Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Associations between substance use, venous thromboembolism (VTE), or peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and its effects on LOS or mortality in patients with HF hospitalized with COVID-19 remains unknown.

ObjectiveThis study identified risk factors associated with poor in-hospital outcomes among patients with HF hospitalized with COVID-19.

MethodsCase control study was conducted of patients with prior diagnosis of HF hospitalized with COVID-19 at an academic tertiary care center from January 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021. Patients with HF hospitalized with COVID-19 with risk factors were compared with those without risk factors for clinical characteristics, length of stay (LOS), and mortality. Multivariate regression was conducted to identify multiple predictors of increased LOS and in-hospital mortality in patients with HF hospitalized with COVID-19.

ResultsTotal of 211 HF patients were hospitalized with COVID-19. Females had longer LOS than males (9 days vs. 7 days; p < 0.001). Compared with patients without peripheral arterial disease (PAD) or ischemic stroke, patients with PAD or ischemic stroke had longer LOS (7 days vs. 9 days; p = 0.012 and 7 days vs. 11 days, p < 0.001; respectively). Older patients (aged 65 and above) had increased in-hospital mortality compared to younger patients (Adjusted OR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.00 - 1.07; p = 0.036). VTE increased mortality more than three-fold in patients with HF hospitalized with COVID-19 (Adjusted OR: 3.33; 95% CI: 1.29 - 8.43; p = 0.011).

ConclusionVascular diseases increase LOS and mortality in patients with HF hospitalized with COVID-19.

8753,Estimated Sp02/Fio2 ratio to predict mortality in patients with suspected COVID-19 in the Emergency Department: a prospective cohort study,"BackgroundThis study examined whether the presence and severity of Type 1 Respiratory Failure (T1RF), as measured by the ratio of pulse oximetry to estimated fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/eFiO2 ratio), is a predictor of in-hospital mortality in patients presenting to the ED with suspected COVID-19 infection.

MethodsWe undertook a prospective observational cohort study of patients admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19 in a single ED in England. We used univariate and multiple logistic regression to examine whether the presence and severity of T1RF in the ED was independently associated with inhospital mortality.

Results180 patients with suspected COVID-19 infection met the inclusion criteria for this study, of which 39 (22%) died. Severity of T1RF was associated with increased mortality with odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals of 1.58 (0.49 - 5.14), 3.60 (1.23 - 10.6) and 18.5 (5.65 - 60.8) for mild, moderate and severe T1RF, respectively. After adjusting for age, gender, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, neutrophil-lymphocyte ration (NLR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the association remained, with ORs of 0.63 (0.13 - 3.03), 3.95 (0.94 - 16.6) and 45.8 (7.25 - 290). The results were consistent across a number of sensitivity analyses.

ConclusionsSeverity of T1RF in the ED is an important prognostic factor of mortality in patients admitted with suspected COVID-19 infection. Current prediction models frequently do not include this factor and should be applied with caution. Further large scale research on predictors of mortality in COVID-19 infection should include SpO2/eFiO2 ratios or a similar measure of respiratory dysfunction.

KEY MESSAGESO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSA number of studies have identified potential variables to predict mortality in patients with COVID-19 but have mainly focused on laboratory measures. The primary pathophysiology and cause of death seems to be lung injury leading to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) like illness, clinically presenting as type 1 respiratory failure (T1RF). Despite this, only a very small number of studies have included measurements of respiratory dysfunction as predictor of mortality.

What this study addsTo our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the association between T1RF as measured by the ratio of pulse oximetry (SpO2) and estimated fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and mortality in patients admitted with suspected COVID-19. The presence and severity of T1RF are strongly associated with mortality. At the same time, other factors previously shown to be associated with mortality are potentially less important than currently assumed, once adjusted for the severity of T1RF.","Von Vopelius-Feldt, J.; Watson, D.; Swanson-Low, C.; Cameron, J.",2020-06-02,Emergency Medicine,10.1101/2020.05.28.20116194,1,Johannes Von Vopelius-Feldt,"North Bristol NHS Trust, Emergency Department",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.20116194v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.20116194v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
13947,Epidemiologically most successful SARS-CoV-2 variant: concurrent mutations in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and spike protein,"The D614G mutation of the Spike protein is thought to be relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we report biological and epidemiological aspects of this mutation. Using pseudotyped lentivectors, we were able to confirm that the G614 variant of the Spike protein is markedly more infectious than the ancestral D614 variant. We demonstrate by molecular modelling that the replacement of aspartate by glycine in position 614 facilitates the transition towards an open state of the Spike protein. To understand whether the increased infectivity of the D614 variant explains its epidemiological success, we analysed the evolution of 27,086 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from GISAID. We observed striking coevolution of D614G with the P323L mutation in the viral polymerase. Importantly, exclusive presence of G614 or L323 did not become epidemiologically relevant. In contrast, the combination of the two mutations gave rise to a viral G/L variant that has all but replaced the initial D/P variant. There was no significant correlation between reported COVID mortality in different countries and the prevalence of the Wuhan versus G/L variant. However, when comparing the speed of emergence and the ultimate predominance in individual countries, the G/L variant displays major epidemiological supremacy. Our results suggest that the P323L mutation, located in the interface domain of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), is a necessary alteration that led to the epidemiological success of the present variant of SARS-CoV-2.","Ilmjärv, S.; Abdul, F.; Acosta-Gutierrez, S.; Estarellas, C.; Galdadas, I.; Casimir, M.; Alessandrini, M.; Gervasio, F.

Among control measures implemented, only national lockdown brought the reproduction number below 1 consistently; introduced one week earlier it could have reduced first wave deaths from 36,700 to 15,700 (95%CrI: 8,900-26,800). Improved clinical care reduced the infection fatality ratio from 1.25% (95%CrI: 1.18%-1.33%) to 0.77% (95%CrI: 0.71%-0.84%). The infection fatality ratio was higher in the elderly residing in care homes (35.9%, 95%CrI: 29.1%-43.4%) than those residing in the community (10.4%, 95%CrI: 9.1%-11.5%). England is still far from herd immunity, with regional cumulative infection incidence to 1st December 2020 between 4.8% (95%CrI: 4.4%-5.1%) and 15.4% (95%CrI: 14.9%-15.9%) of the population.

2243,Validity of Wrist and Forehead Temperature in Temperature Screening in the General Population During the Outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus: a prospective real-world study,"AimsTemperature screening is important in the population during the outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). This study aimed to compare the accuracy and precision of wrist and forehead temperature with tympanic temperature under different circumstances.

MethodsWe performed a prospective observational study in a real-life population. We consecutively collected wrist and forehead temperatures in Celsius ({degrees}C) using a non-contact infrared thermometer (NCIT). We also measured the tympanic temperature using a tympanic thermometers (IRTT) and defined fever as a tympanic temperature [&ge;]37.3{degrees}C.

ResultsWe enrolled a total of 528 participants including 261 indoor and 267 outdoor participants. We divided outdoor participants into four types according to their means of transportation to the hospital as walk, bicycle, electric vehicle, car, and inside the car. Under different circumstance, the mean difference ranged from -1.72 to -0.56{degrees}C in different groups for the forehead measurements, and -0.96 to -0.61{degrees}C for the wrist measurements. Both measurements had high fever screening abilities in inpatients (wrist: AUC 0.790; 95% CI: 0.725-0.854, P <0.001; forehead: AUC 0.816; 95% CI: 0.757-0.876, P <0.001). The cut-off value of wrist measurement for detecting tympanic temperature [&ge;]37.3{degrees}C was 36.2{degrees}C with a 86.4% sensitivity and a 67.0% specificity, and the best threshold of forehead measurement was also 36.2{degrees}C with a 93.2% sensitivity and a 60.0% specificity.

ConclusionsWrist measurement is more stable than forehead measurement under different circumstance. Both measurements have great fever screening abilities for indoor patients. The cut-off value of both measurements was 36.2{degrees}C.

Deep classification models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), require large-scale datasets in order to be trained and perform properly. Since the number of X-ray samples related to COVID-19 is limited, transfer learning (TL) appears as the go-to method to alleviate the demand for training data and develop accurate automated diagnosis models. In this context, networks are able to gain knowledge from pretrained networks on large-scale image datasets or alternative data-rich sources (i.e. bacterial and viral pneumonia radiographs).

7438,SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in health care workers,"BackgroundThe correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 and their longevity remain unclear. Studies in severely ill individuals have identified robust cellular and humoral immune responses against the virus. Asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 has also been described, but it is unknown whether this is sufficient to produce antibody responses.

MethodsWe performed a cross-sectional study recruiting 554 health care workers from University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust who were at work and asymptomatic. Participants were tested for current infection with SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab for real-time polymerase chain reaction and for seroconversion by the measurement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results were interpreted in the context of previous, self-reported symptoms of illness consistent with COVID-19.

ResultsThe point prevalence of infection with SARS-CoV-2, determined by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on nasopharnygeal swab was 2.39% (n=13/544). Serum was available on 516 participants. The overall rate of seroconversion in the cohort was 24.4% (n=126/516). Individuals who had previously experienced a symptomatic illness consistent with COVID-19 had significantly greater seroconversion rates than those who had remained asymptomatic (37.5% vs 17.1%, {chi}2 =21.1034, p<0.0001). In the week preceding peak COVID-19-related mortality at UHBFT, seroconversion rates amongst those who were suffering from symptomatic illnesses peaked at 77.8%. Prior symptomatic illness generated quantitatively higher antibody responses than asymptomatic seroconversion. Seroconversion rates were highest amongst those working in housekeeping (34.5%), acute medicine (33.3%) and general internal medicine (30.3%) with lower rates observed in participants working in intensive care (14.8%) and emergency medicine (13.3%).

ConclusionsIn a large cross-sectional seroprevalence study of health-care workers, we demonstrate that asymptomatic seroconversion occurs, however prior symptomatic illness is associated with quantitatively higher antibody responses. The identification that the potential for seroconversion in health-care workers can associate differentially with certain hospital departments may inform future infection control and occupational health practices.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSTo date, no study has examined the cross-sectional seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing evidence suggests that the levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies developing following infection may vary with disease severity in keeping with previous coronavirus pandemics.

Added value of this studyWe demonstrate that seroconversion can occur in health care workers who have suffered no previous symptoms of SARS-Cov-2 infection. However, prior symptomatic infection tends to drive quantitatively superior antibody responses against the virus. We observed differential seroconversion rates in individuals working within different hospital departments. Using intensive care as a reference, the relative risk for seroconversion was greatest for those working in housekeeping, acute and general internal medicine.

Implications of all the available evidenceInsight into the current seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies within a high-risk cohort of health-care workers is of direct relevance as a reference point for future community serological surveys. We provide further evidence of asymptomatic infection and seroconversion, strengthening the argument for regular, routine screening of health-care workers. Finally, we provide evidence that individuals working in particular roles within the NHS are at greater risk of seroconversion with significant implications for their occupational health.","Shields, A.

13196,Social Media Reveals Psychosocial Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"BackgroundThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused several disruptions in personal and collective lives worldwide. The uncertainties surrounding the pandemic have also led to multi-faceted mental health concerns, which can be exacerbated with precautionary measures such as social distancing and self-quarantining, as well as societal impacts such as economic downturn and job loss. Despite noting this as a """"mental health tsunami,"""" the psychological effects of the COVID-19 crisis remains unexplored at scale. Consequently, public health stakeholders are currently limited in identifying ways to provide timely and tailored support during these circumstances.

ObjectiveOur work aims to provide insights regarding peoples psychosocial concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic by leveraging social media data. We aim to study the temporal and linguistic changes in symptomatic mental health and support-seeking expressions in the pandemic context.

MethodsWe obtain ~60M Twitter streaming posts originating from the U.S. from March, 24 - May, 25, 2020, and compare these with ~40M posts from a comparable period in 2019 to causally attribute the effect of COVID-19 on peoples social media self-disclosure. Using these datasets, we study peoples self-disclosure on social media in terms of symptomatic mental health concerns and expressions seeking support. We employ transfer learning classifiers that identify the social media language indicative of mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, stress, and suicidal ideation) and support (emotional and informational support). We then examine the changes in psychosocial expressions over time and language, comparing the 2020 and 2019 datasets.

ResultsWe find that all of the examined psychosocial expressions have significantly increased during the COVID-19 crisis - mental health symptomatic expressions have increased by ~14%, and support seeking expressions have increased by ~5%, both thematically related to COVID-19. We also observe a steady decline and eventual plateauing in these expressions during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have been due to habituation or due to supportive policy measures enacted during this period. Our language analyses highlight that people express concerns that are contextually related to the COVID-19 crisis.

ConclusionsWe studied the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 crisis by using social media data from 2020, finding that peoples mental health symptomatic and support-seeking expressions significantly increased during the COVID-19 period as compared to similar data from 2019. However, this effect gradually lessened over time, suggesting that people adapted to the circumstances and their """"new normal"""". Our linguistic analyses revealed that people expressed mental health concerns regarding personal and professional challenges, healthcare and precautionary measures, and pandemic-related awareness. This work shows the potential to provide insights to mental healthcare and stakeholders and policymakers in planning and implementing measures to mitigate mental health risks amidst the health crisis.","Saha, K.; Torous, J.; Caine, E.

9682,ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF TRANSMISSION DURING PROLONGED VIRAL SHEDDING ON THE EFFECT OF LOCKDOWN RELAXATION ON COVID-19,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWA key parameter in epidemiological modeling which characterizes the spread of an infectious disease is the mean serial interval. There is increasing evidence supporting a prolonged viral shedding window for COVID-19, but the transmissibility in this phase is unclear. Based on this, we build a model including an additional compartment of infectious individuals who stay infectious for a longer duration than the reported serial interval, but with infectivity reduced to varying degrees. We find that such an assumption also yields a plausible model in explaining the data observed so far, but has different implications for the future predictions in case of a gradual easing on the lockdown measures. Considering the role of modeling in important decisions such as easing lockdown measures and adjusting hospital capacity, we believe that it is critically important to consider a chronically infectious population as an alternative modeling approach to better interpret the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.","Tepekule, B.; Hauser, A.; Kachalov, V.

17909,Vitamin D - contrary to vitamin K - does not associate with clinical outcome in hospitalized COVID-19 patients,"SARS-CoV-2 causes remarkably variable disease from asymptomatic individuals to respiratory insufficiency and coagulopathy. Vitamin K deficiency was recently found to associate with clinical outcome in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. Vitamin D has been hypothesized to reduce disease susceptibility by modulating inflammation, yet little is known about its role in disease severity. Considering the critical interaction between vitamin K and vitamin D in calcium and elastic fiber metabolism, we determined vitamin D status in the same cohort of 135 hospitalized COVID-19 patients by measuring blood 25(OH)D levels. We found no difference in vitamin D status between those with good and poor outcome (defined as intubation and/or death). Instead, we found vitamin D sufficient persons (25(OH)D >50 nmol/L) had accelerated elastic fiber degradation compared to those with mild deficiency (25(OH)D 25-50 nmol/L). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that vitamin D might have both favorable anti-inflammatory and unfavorable pro-calcification effects during COVID-19 and that vitamin K might compensate for the latter.","Walk, J.; Dofferhoff, A.

We assembled a transdisciplinary team of knowledgeable and dedicated physicians, scientists, technologists and administrators, who rapidly built a multi-platform, PCR- and serology-based detection program, established drive-thru facilities and drafted and implemented guidelines that enabled efficient testing of our patients and employees. This process was extremely complex, due to the limited availability of needed reagents, but outreach to our research scientists and to multiple diagnostic laboratory companies and government officials enabled us to implement both FDA authorized and laboratory developed testing (LDT)-based testing protocols. We analyzed our workforce needs and created teams of appropriately skilled and certified workers, to safely process patient samples and conduct SARS-CoV-2 testing and contact tracing.

4291,Scaling diagnostics in times of COVID-19: Colorimetric Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assisted by a 3D-printed incubator for cost-effective and scalable detection of SARS-CoV-2,"By the third week of June 2020, more than 8,500,000 positive cases of COVID-19 and more than 450,000 deaths had been officially reported worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Latin America, India, and Africa--territories in which the mounted infrastructure for diagnosis is greatly underdeveloped. Here, we demonstrate the combined use of a three-dimensional (3D)-printed incubation chamber for commercial Eppendorf PCR tubes, and a colorimetric embodiment of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction scheme for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids. We used this strategy to detect and amplify SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences using a set of in-house designed initiators that target regions encoding the N protein. We were able to detect and amplify SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in the range of 62 to 2 x 105 DNA copies by this straightforward method. Using synthetic SARS-CoV-2 samples and a limited number of RNA extracts from patients, we also demonstrate that colorimetric LAMP is a quantitative method comparable in diagnostic performance to RT-qPCR. We envision that LAMP may greatly enhance the capabilities for COVID-19 testing in situations where RT-qPCR is not feasible or is unavailable. Moreover, the portability, ease of use, and reproducibility of this strategy make it a reliable alternative for deployment of point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 detection efforts during the pandemics.","Gonzalez-Gonzalez, E.; Lara-Mayorga, I.

25415,"Comparing mental health trajectories of four different types of key workers with non-key workers: A 12-month follow-up observational study of 21,874 adults in England during the COVID-19 pandemic","BackgroundThere are concerns that key workers may be at a greater risk for psychological distress than non-key workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little research has included key workers outside of the healthcare sector or has disaggregated key workers into different subgroups.

AimsTo examine longitudinal changes in mental health over 12 months during the COVID-19 pandemic comparing four different groups of key workers with non-key workers.

MethodLongitudinal data were from 21,874 adults living in England (21 March 2020 to 22 February 2021). Latent growth modelling (LGM) was utilised to compare growth trajectories of depressive and anxiety symptoms in non-key workers and four types of key workers: i) health and social care workers, ii) teachers and childcare workers, iii) public service workers, and iv) essential services key workers (e.g., food chain or utility workers).

ResultsWhen accounting for both time-invariant and time-varying covariates, key workers in the essential services category had consistently higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than non-key workers across the whole of the study period. There was little difference in mental health trajectories between health/social care, teachers/childcare and public service worker categories and non-key workers.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest risk for poorer mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic varies within the broad category of key workers generally, and that those working in utility, food chain, and transport roles are especially at risk. Future research should focus on identifying which aspects of working conditions may be contributing to occupational stress in these groups.","Paul, E.; Mak, H.

6943,A Continuously Active Antimicrobial Coating effective against Human Coronavirus 229E,"The disinfection of high-contact surfaces is seen as an infection control practice to prevent the spread of pathogens by fomites. Unfortunately, recontamination of these surfaces can occur any time after the use of common disinfectants. We recently reported on a novel continuously active antimicrobial coating which was shown to reduce the spread of healthcare acquired infections in hospitals. We evaluated a modified coating that demonstrated a residual efficacy against viruses. The coated surfaces were found to be effective against human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E, reducing the concentration of these viruses by greater than 90% in 10 minutes and by greater than 99.9% after two hours of contact. The coating formulation when tested in suspension yielded a greater than 99.99% reduction of HCoV 229E within ten minutes of contact. This outcome presents an opportunity for controlling the transmission of COVID-19 from contaminated fomites.","Ikner, L. A.; Torrey, J. R.; Gundy, P. M.; Gerba, C.

14522,Exploring options for reprocessing of N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators (N95-FFRs) amidst COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review,"BackgroundThere is global shortage of Personal Protective Equipment due to COVID-19 pandemic. N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators (N95-FFRs) provide respiratory protection against respiratory pathogens including SARS-COV-2. There is scant literature on reprocessing methods which can enable reuse of N95-FFRs.

AimWe conducted this study to evaluate research done, prior to COVID-19 pandemic, on various decontamination methods for reprocessing of N95-FFRs.

MethodsWe searched 5 electronic databases (Pubmed, Google Scholar, Crossref, Ovid, ScienceDirect) and 1 Grey literature database (OpenGrey). We included original studies, published prior to year 2020, which had evaluated any decontamination method on FFRs. Studies had evaluated a reprocessing method against parameters namely physical changes, user acceptability, respirator fit, filter efficiency, microbicidal efficacy and presence of chemical residues post-reprocessing.

Findings and ConclusionsOverall, we found 7887 records amongst which 17 original research articles were finally included for qualitative analysis. Overall, 21 different types of decontamination or reprocessing methods for N95-FFRs were evaluated. Most commonly evaluated method for reprocessing of FFRs was Ultraviolet (Type-C) irradiation (UVGI) which was evaluated in 13/17 (76%) studies.

We found published literature is scant on this topic despite warning signs of pandemic of a respiratory illness over the years. Promising technologies requiring expeditious evaluation are UVGI, Microwave generated steam (MGS) and Hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV). Global presence of technologies, which have been given Emergency use authorisation for N95-FFR reprocessing, is extremely limited. Reprocessing of N95-FFRs by MGS should be considered for emergency implementation in resource limited settings to tackle shortage of N95-FFRs.

7018,"Preliminary evaluation of the safety and efficacy of oral human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 in the treatment of patients of COVID-19, a small-scale, single-arm, exploratory safety study","Background& AimsThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global epidemic and has caused a lasting and huge loss of life security, economic development and social stability in more than 180 countries around the world. Unfortunately, there is still no specific treatment for COVID-19 till now, therefore, at this point, all potential therapies need to be critically considered. LL-37 is one of the best-studied human antimicrobial peptide (AMPs) that has a broad-spectrum activity against bacteria and viruses. The use of living, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is an effective approach for delivery of therapeutic proteins. The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of the Lactococcus lactis which has been genetically modified to produce the therapeutic human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 (herein after referred to cas001) in the patients of COVID-19.

MethodsFirstly we constructed genetically modified food-grade probiotic, Lactococcus lactis, with sequence of seven tandem repeats of mature human LL-37 under control of the nisin-inducible nisA promoter to produce the cas001. A total of 20 healthy SD rats, half male and half female (There were five male and five female in the control group, the same in treatment group) were used to observe the acute toxic reaction and death after daily administration of cas001 for three weeks, which helps to provide necessary reference basis for clinical dose selection, verificaition of toxic reaction and possible target organs. According to the estimated clinical dosage of 1 x 108CFU /kg/day, considering the conversion of body surface area, the dose for rats should be multiplied by 6.17 to 6 x 108 CFU/kg/day. We administrated 100 times higher dose at 6 x 1010 CFU/ /kg/day to rats. In order to investigate the pharmacokinetics of cas001, male SD rats (body weight 250-300g, 1 x 1010 /animal, n=3) were given oral administration of LL-37 bacteria powder. The concentration of LL-37 in the blood before and after gavage was detected by ELISA kit (Hycult biotechnology Cat# HK321).

Human clinical study was approved by Ethics committee of Chinese PLA General Hospital (S2020-074-04) and a total of 11 patients with mild symptoms were enrolled in Wuhan hankou hospital and Huoshenshan hospital. They were enrolled voluntarily and all patients signed informed consent. Among them, there were 5 males and 6 females, aged 55 {+/-} 12 (36-70) years old, and the duration from onset to medication enrollment was 35 {+/-} 19 (5-68) days. 6 patients were nucleic acid positive and 5 patients were nucleic acid negative when they were enrolled. All patients received the oral drug cas001 treatment according to requirement(1 x 109 CFU/capsule, 3 capsules/time, three times a day for 3weeks), with an average follow-up time of 33 {+/-} 15 days (see table 1 for the results).

C_TABLECAPTION C_TBL FindingsWestern blot analysis shows that reasonable amount of LL-37 were induced by different concentrations of nisin, which means we have successfully constructed cas001. In the pre-clinical safety evaluation test, after three weeks administration of cas001, no adverse effects were observed on the rats body weight, food and water intake, hematological or serum biochemical parameters. The results showed that the LD50 of cas001 was higher than that of the 100 times of the expected clinical dose of 6 x 1010 CFU/day. These results showed that cas001 could be safe in animal experiments. In addition, rat pharmacokinetics results showed that the serum concentration of LL-37 reached peak 2 hours after gavage of cas001 and returned to basal level 6 hours after gavage. During study period, the volunteers did not feel any discomfort while taking the cas001 capsules, and two hours after oral administration, the concentration of LL-37 were increased in healthy volunteers.

cas001 shows definite effect in the improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms and is possible to have effects in improving the systemic symptoms and respiratory symptoms and may play a role in the improvement of results of nucleic acid test and lung CT test. 11 patients enrolled showed good compliance, tolerance, subjective feeling and actively interacted with the doctors. None of the patients had any adverse reactions.

ConclusionsBased on above observations, we conclude here that as an oral anti-viral agent, cas001 displayed good safety profiles. It is very hard to reach conclusion of clinical outcomes related to the cas001, although changes of several symptoms indicate encouraging findings.","Zhang, H.; Zhao, Y.; Jiang, X.; Zhao, Y.; Li, Y.; Li, C.; Dong, M.; Luan, Z.; Yan, C.; Jiao, J.; Zhao, C.; Li, H.; Chen, W.; Feng, C.; Tian, L.; Qin, E.; Mu, J.; Li, C.; Zeng, T.; Feng, S.; Wang, S.; Guan, X.; Li, T.; Yu, H.; Zheng, A.; Jin, W.; Sun, G.",2020-05-15,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.11.20064584,1,Gang Sun,Chinese PLA General Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.20064584v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.20064584v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
10106,Clinical practice guidelines and recommendations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: systematic review and critical appraisal,"BackgroundThe number of published clinical practice guidelines and recommendations related to SARS-CoV-2 infections causing COVID-19 has rapidly increased. However, insufficient consideration of appropriate methodologies in the guideline development could lead to misleading information, uncertainty among professionals, and potentially harmful actions for patients.

PurposeRapid systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and recommendations in the context of COVID-19 to explore if basic methodological standards of guideline development have been met.

Data sourcesMEDLINE [PubMed], CINAHL [Ebsco], Trip and manual search; from Feb 1st 2020 until April 27th 2020.

Study selectionAll types of healthcare workers providing any kind of healthcare to any patient population in any setting.

Data extractionAt least two reviewers independently extracted guideline characteristics, conducted critical appraisal according to The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument (AGREE II) and classified the guidelines using the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies (AWMF) Guidance Manual and Rules for Guideline Development. We plan six-month updates (living review).

Data synthesisThere were 1342 titles screened and 188 guidelines included. The highest average AGREE II domain score was 89% for scope and purpose, the lowest for rigor of development (25%). Only eight guidelines (4%) were based on a systematic literature search and a structured consensus process by representative experts (classified as the highest methodological quality, S3 according to AWMF). Patients were only included in the development of one guideline. A process for regular updates was described in 27 guidelines (14%).

LimitationsMethodological focus only.

ConclusionsDespite clear scope, most publications fell short of basic methodological standards of guideline development. Future research should monitor the evolving methodological quality of the guidelines and their updates over time.

10874,"Airway expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, and proteases, TMPRSS2 and furin, in severe asthma","BackgroundPatients with severe asthma may have a greater risk of dying from COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and enzyme proteases, transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and furin are needed for the attachment and invasion of the virus into host cells. We determined whether their expression in the airways of severe asthma patients is increased.

MethodWe examined the microarray mRNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin in the sputum, bronchial brush and bronchial biopsies of participants in the European U-BIOPRED cohort.

ResultsACE2 and furin sputum gene expression was significantly increased in severe non-smoking asthma compared to mild-moderate asthma and healthy volunteers. By contrast, TMPRSS2 expression in bronchial biopsy and bronchial brushings was increased in severe smoking and ex-smoking asthmatics, and so was furin expression in bronchial brushings. Several clinical parameters including male gender, oral steroid use and nasal polyps were positively associated with ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin expression levels. There was a higher expression of ACE2 and furin in the sputum neutrophilic molecular phenotype with inflammasome activation compared to the eosinophilic Type2-high or paucigranulocytic phenotypes. The enrichment score of the IL-13-Type2 gene signature was positively correlated with ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin levels.

ConclusionThese key determinants of virus entry into the lungs may contribute to the poorer outcomes from COVID-19 disease in patients with severe asthma.

""""take home"""" messageIn severe asthma, gene expression of ACE, TMPRSS2 and furin are elevated compared to mild-moderate asthma and healthy volunteers, particularly in neutrophilic asthma.

23628,"A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of convalescent plasma in adults with severe COVID-19","BackgroundAlthough convalescent plasma has been widely used to treat severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), data from randomized controlled trials that support its efficacy are limited.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma among adults hospitalized with severe and critical COVID-19.

DesignRandomized, double-blind, controlled, multicenter, phase 2 trial conducted from April 21st to November 27th, 2020.

SettingFive hospitals in New York City (NY, USA) and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil).

ParticipantsHospitalized patients aged [&ge;]18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, infiltrates on chest imaging and oxygen saturation [&le;] 94% on room air or requirement for supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

InterventionParticipants were randomized 2:1 to a single transfusion of either 1 unit of convalescent or normal control plasma.

MeasurementsThe primary outcome was clinical status at 28 days, measured using an ordinal scale and analyzed using a proportional odds model in the intention-to-treat population.

ResultsOf 223 participants enrolled, 150 were randomized to receive convalescent plasma and 73 to normal control plasma. At 28 days, no significant improvement in clinical status was observed in participants randomized to convalescent plasma (with an odds ratio (OR) of a 1-point improvement in the scale: 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-2.68, p=0.180).

However, 28-day mortality was significantly lower in participants randomized to convalescent plasma versus control plasma (19/150 [12.6%] versus 18/73 [24.6%], OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22-0.91, p=0.034). The median titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in infused convalescent plasma units was 1:160 (IQR 1:80-1:320). In a subset of nasopharyngeal swab samples (n=40) from Brazil that underwent genomic sequencing, no evidence of neutralization-escape mutants was detected. Serious adverse events occurred in 39/147 (27%) participants who received convalescent plasma and 26/72 (36%) participants who received control plasma.

LimitationsSome participants did not receive high-titer convalescent plasma.

ConclusionIn adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19, use of convalescent plasma was not associated with significant improvement in 28 days clinical status. The significant reduction in mortality associated with convalescent plasma, however, may warrant further evaluation.

22296,An analysis of school absences in England during the Covid-19 pandemic,"The introduction of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 infection, in the UK in early 2020, resulted in the UK government introducing several control policies in order to reduce the spread of disease. As part of these restrictions, schools were closed to all pupils in March (except for vulnerable and key worker children), before re-opening to certain year groups in June. Finally all school children returned to the classroom in September. In this paper, we analyse the data on school absences from September 2020 to December 2020 as a result of COVID-19 infection and how that varied through time as other measures in the community were introduced. We utilise data from the Educational Settings database compiled by the Department for Education and examine how pupil and teacher absences change in both primary and secondary schools.

Our results show that absences as a result of COVID-19 infection rose steadily following the re-opening of schools in September. Cases in teachers were seen to decline during the November lockdown, particularly in those regions that had previously been in tier 3, the highest level of control at the time. Cases in secondary school pupils increased for the first two weeks of the November lockdown, before decreasing. Since the introduction of the tier system, the number of absences owing to confirmed infection in primary schools was observed to be significantly lower than in secondary schools across all regions and tiers.

In December, we observed a large rise in the number of absences per school in secondary school settings in the South East and Greater London, but such rises were not observed in other regions or in primary school settings. We conjecture that the increased transmissibility of the new variant in these regions may have contributed to this rise in cases in secondary schools. Finally, we observe a positive correlation between cases in the community and cases in schools in most regions, with weak evidence suggesting that cases in schools lag behind cases in the surrounding community. We conclude that there is not significant evidence to suggest that schools are playing a significant role in driving spread in the community and that careful monitoring may be required as schools re-open to determine the effect associated with open schools upon community incidence.","Southall, E.

10029,Assessing the effect of global travel and contact reductions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic and resurgence,"Travel and physical distancing interventions have been implemented across the World to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, but studies are needed to quantify the effectiveness of these measures across regions and time. Timely population mobility data were obtained to measure travel and contact reductions in 135 countries or territories. During the 10 weeks of March 22 - May 30, 2020, domestic travel in study regions has dramatically reduced to a median of 59% (interquartile range [IQR] 43% - 73%) of normal levels seen before the outbreak, with international travel down to 26% (IQR 12% - 35%). If these travel and physical distancing interventions had not been deployed across the World, the cumulative number of cases might have shown a 97-fold (IQR 79 - 116) increase, as of May 31, 2020. However, effectiveness differed by the duration and intensity of interventions and relaxation scenarios, with variations in case severity seen across populations, regions, and seasons.

7693,COVID-19 case forecasting model for Sri Lanka based on Stringency Index,"IntroductionSri Lanka has been able to contain COVID-19 transmission through very stringent suppression measures implemented from the onset. The country had been under a strict lockdown since 20 March 2020, and currently the lockdown is being relaxed gradually. The objective of this paper is to describe a projection model for COVID-19 cases in Sri Lanka applied to different scenarios after lockout, utilizing the stringency index as a proxy of total government response.

MethodsCOVID-19 Stringency Index (C19SI) is published and updated real time by a research group from Oxford university on 17 selected mitigation and suppression measures employed by different countries. We have mapped and validated the stringency index for Sri Lanka and subsequently validated the projection model in two phases. Predictions for the base-case scenario, less stringent scenarios, advanced relaxation scenarios, and high-risk districts were done with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) using the validated model, utilizing data up to 10th May.

ResultsC19SI was able to accommodate all of the government responses. The model using validated C19SI could predict number of cases with 95% confidence for a period of two weeks. The model predicted base-case scenario of 815 (95%CI, 753-877) active cases by 17 May 2020 and 648 (95%CI, 599-696) cases for the high-risk districts by 18 May 2020. The model further predicted 3,159 (95%CI, 2,928-3,391) cases for 75% stringency and 928,824 (95%CI, 861,772-995,877) cases for 50% stringency. Advancing normalcy by three weeks resulted in the case load increasing to 4526 (95%CI, 4309-4744) by 30 June 2020.

ConclusionThe proposed prediction model based on C19SI provides policy makers an evidence based scientific method for identifying suppression measures that can be relaxed at the most appropriate time.","Jayatilleke, A.

13603,The effect of smoking on COVID-19 symptom severity: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SAR2-COV-2), and was first identified in Wuhan, China in December of 2019, but quickly spread to the rest of the world, causing a pandemic. While some studies have found no link between smoking status and severe COVID-19, others demonstrated a significant one. The present study aimed to determine the relationship between smoking and clinical COVID-19 severity via a systematic meta-analysis approach.

MethodsWe searched the Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases to identify clinical studies suitable for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Studies reporting smoking status and comparing non-severe and severe patients were included. Non-severe cases were described as mild, common type, non-intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, survivors, and severe cases as critical, need for ICU, refractory, and non-survivors.

ResultsA total of 16 articles detailing 11322 COVID-19 patients were included. Our meta-analysis revealed a relationship between a history of smoking and severe COVID-19 cases (OR=2.17; 95% CI: 1.37-3.46; P <.001). Additionally, we found an association between the current smoking status and severe COVID-19 (OR=1.51; 95% CI: 1.12-2.05; P <.008). In 10.7% (978/9067) of non-smokers, COVID-19 was severe, while in active smokers, severe COVID-19 occurred in 21.2% (65/305) of cases.

ConclusionActive smoking and a history of smoking are clearly associated with severe COVID-19. The SARS-COV-2 epidemic should serve as an impetus for patients and those at risk to maintain good health practices and discontinue smoking.","Gulsen, A.; Arpinar Yigitbas, B.; Uslu, B.; Droemann, D.; Kilinc, O.",2020-08-17,Respiratory Medicine,10.1101/2020.08.15.20102699,1,Askin Gulsen,"Department of Pneumology, University of Lubeck, Lubeck, Germany",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20102699v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20102699v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1155/2020/7590207

In this ecological study, we identified county-level variables associated with the COVID-19 case-fatality rate (CFR) using publicly available datasets and a negative binomial generalized linear model. Variables associated with decreased CFR included a greater number of hospitals per 10,000 people, banning religious gatherings, a higher percentage of people living in mobile homes, and a higher percentage of uninsured people. Variables associated with increased CFR included a higher percentage of the population over age 65, a higher percentage of Black or African Americans, a higher asthma prevalence, and a greater number of hospitals in a county. By identifying factors that are associated with COVID-19 CFR in US counties, we hope to help officials target public health interventions and healthcare resources to locations that are at increased risk of COVID-19 fatalities.","Millar, J.

7231,Traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the Blood of COVID-19 Patients,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third virus that caused coronavirus-related outbreaks over the past 20 years. The outbreak was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, but rapidly progressed into a pandemic of an unprecedented scale since the 1918 flu pandemic. Besides respiratory complications in COVID-19 patients, clinical characterizations of severe infection cases showed several other comorbidities, including multiple organ failure (liver, kidney, and heart) and septic shock. To better understand COVID-19 pathogenesis in different human organs, we interrogated the presence of the virus in the blood, or any of its components, which might provide a form of trafficking or hiding to the virus. By computationally analyzing high-throughput sequence data from patients with active COVID-19 infection, we found evidence of only traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), while the virus RNA was abundant in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from the same patients. We also devised a  viral spike-to-actin RNA normalization, as a metric to compare across various samples and minimize errors caused by intersample variability in human RNA. To the best of our knowledge, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the PBMC of COVID-19 patients has not been reported before, and this observation could suggest immune presentation, but discounts the possibility of extensive viral infection of lymphocytes or monocytes.","Moustafa, A.; Aziz, R.

21559,Self-Reported Mask Wearing Greatly Exceeds Directly Observed Use: Urgent Need for Policy Intervention in Kenya,"BackgroundMany countries in sub-Saharan Africa have so far avoided large outbreaks of COVID-19, perhaps due to the strict lockdown measures that were imposed early in the pandemic. Yet the harsh socio-economic consequences of the lockdowns have led many governments to ease the restrictions in favor of less stringent mitigation strategies. In the absence of concrete plans for widespread vaccination, masks remain one of the few tools available to low-income populations to avoid the spread of SARS-CoV-2 for the foreseeable future.

MethodsWe compare mask use data collected through self-reports from phone surveys and direct observations in public spaces from population-representative samples in Ugunja subcounty, a rural setting in Western Kenya. We examine mask use in different situations and compare mask use by gender, age, location, and the riskiness of the activity

FindingsWe assess mask use data from 1,960 phone survey respondents and 9,549 direct observations. While only 12% of people admitted in phone interviews to not wearing a mask in public, 90% of people we observed did not have a mask visible (77.7% difference, 95% CI 0.742, 0.802). Self-reported mask use was significantly higher than observed mask use in all scenarios (i.e. in the village, in the market, on public transportation).

InterpretationWe find limited compliance with the national government mask mandate in Kenya using directly observed data, but high rates of self-reported mask use. This vast gap suggests that people are aware that mask use is socially desirable, but in practice they do not adopt this behavior.

Focusing public policy efforts on improving adoption of mask use via education and behavioral interventions may be needed to improve compliance.

8126,Eruption of COVID-19 like illness in a remote village in Papua (Indonesia),"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic is creating significant challenges for healthcare infrastructure for countries of all development and resource levels. Low-and-middle resource countries face even larger challenges, as their resources are stretched and often insufficient under normal circumstances. A village in the Papuan highlands of Indonesia; small, isolated, accessed only by small plane or trekking has experienced an outbreak typical of COVID-19.

Methodology/Principal FindingsThis description was compiled from patient care records by lay healthcare workers in M20 (a pseudonym) during and after an outbreak and from medical doctors responding to online requests for help. We assume that, for reasons given, the outbreak that has been described was COVID-19. The dense social structure of the village resulted in a rapid infection of 90-95% of the population. Physical distancing and isolation measures were used, but probably implemented suboptimal and too late, and their effect on the illness course was unclear. The relatively young population, with a majority of women, probably influenced the impact of the epidemic, resulting in only two deaths so far.

Conclusions/SignificanceThis outbreak pattern of suspected SARS-CoV-2 in a village in the highlands of Papua (Indonesia) presents a unique report of the infection of an entire village population over five weeks. The age distribution, common in Papuan highland villages may have reduced case fatality rate (CFR) in this context and that might be the case in similar remote areas since survival to old age is already very limited and CFR among younger people is lower.

Author summaryA village in the Papuan highlands of Indonesia; small, isolated, accessed only by small plane or trekking has experienced an outbreak typical of COVID-19. The outbreak affected 90-95% of approximately 200 residents between 20 February 2020 and 31 March 2020. Lay health workers, consisting of trained local volunteers, without healthcare facilities and limited medication options reached out for help online and managed with what they had available. Their experience is relevant to others in similar settings.

2142,"Clinical characteristics of 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","BackgroundAlthough the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused over 2200 deaths in China, there was no study about death yet. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of non-survivors with COVID-19.

MethodsFor this retrospective, single-center study, we included 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR between Jan 21 and Feb 10, 2020 according to the recommended protocol. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 14, 2020. This study was approved by the ethics commissions of the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan, with a waiver of informed consent due to a public health outbreak investigation.

FindingsWe included 36 patients who died from COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 69.22 years (SD 9.64, range 50-90). 25(69.44%) patients were males, and 11 (30.56%) female. 26 (72.22%) patients had chronic diseases, mainly including hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Patients had common clinical symptoms of fever (34 [94.44%] patients), cough (28 [77.78%] patients), shortness of breath (21 [58.33%] patients), and fatigue (17 [47.22%] patient). Chest computed tomographic scans showed that 31 (96.88%) patients had bilateral pneumonia. Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.67{square}x{square}109/L [SD, 0.33]) occurred in 24 patients (70.59%), decreased albumin (30.18, [SD, 4.76]) in 25 patients (80.65%), elevated D-dimer (8.64 [IQR, 2.39-20]) in 27 patients (100%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (502.5 U/L [IQR, 410-629]) in 26 patients (100%). Nearly all of the patients have elevated CRP (106.3 mg/L [IQR, 60.83-225.3]), PCT (0.61 ng/ml [IQR, 0.16-2.10]) and IL-6 (100.6 pg/ml [IQR, 51.51-919.5]). Most patients received antiviral therapy and antibiotic therapy, and more than half of patients received glucocorticoid therapy (25 [69.44%]). All the patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. One (2.78%) patient presented with acute renal injury. The median time from onset to death was 17 days.

InterpretationLots of patients died from COVID-19 till now. The median survival time of these non-survivors from onset to death was about 2 weeks. Most patients were older males with comorbidities. They finally progressed to ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. Gradually decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation biomarkers were common, and need to be monitored in the routine treatment.

8978,"The role of children in the spread of COVID-19: Using household data from Bnei Brak, Israel, to estimate the relative susceptibility and infectivity of children","BackgroundOne of the significant unanswered questions about COVID-19 epidemiology relates to the role of children in transmission. In this study we estimate susceptibility and infectivity of children compared to those of adults. Understanding the age-structured transmission dynamics of the outbreak provides precious and timely information to guide epidemic modelling and public health policy.

MethodsData were collected from households in the city of Bnei Brak, Israel, in which all household members were tested for COVID-19 using PCR. To estimate relative transmission parameters in the absence of data on who infected whom, we developed an estimation method based on a discrete stochastic dynamic model of the spread of the epidemic within a household. The model describes the propagation of the disease between household members allowing for susceptibility and infectivity parameters to vary among two age groups. The parameter estimates are obtained by a maximum likelihood method, where the likelihood function is computed based on the stochastic model via simulations.

FindingsInspection of the data reveals that children are less likely to become infected compared to adults (25% of children infected over all households, 44% of adults infected over all households, excluding index cases), and the chances of becoming infected increases with age. An interesting exception is that infants up to age one year are more likely to be infected than children between one and four. Using our modelling approach, we estimate that the susceptibility of children (under 20 years old) is 45% [40%, 55%] of the susceptibility of adults. The infectivity of children was estimated to be 85% [65%, 110%] relative to that of adults.

InterpretationIt is widely observed that the percentage of children within confirmed cases is low. A common explanation is that children who are infected are less likely to develop symptoms than adults, and thus are less likely to be tested. We estimate that children are less susceptible to infection, which is an additional factor explaining their relatively low rate of occurrence within confirmed cases. Moreover, our results indicate that children, when infected, are somewhat less prone to infect others compared to adults; however, this result is not statistically significant.

The resulting estimates of susceptibility and infectivity of children compared to adults are crucial for deciding on appropriate interventions, and for controlling the epidemic outbreak and its progress. These estimates can guide age-dependent public health policy such as school closure and opening. However, while our estimates of childrens susceptibility and infectivity are lower than those of adults within a household, it is important to bear in mind that their role in the spread of COVID-19 outside the household, is also affected by different contact patterns and hygiene habits.","Dattner, I.; Goldberg, Y.; Katriel, G.; Yaari, R.; Gal, N.; Miron, Y.; Ziv, A.; Hamo, Y.; Huppert, A.",2020-10-11,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.03.20121145,2,Yair Goldberg,Technion - Israel Institute of Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.20121145v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.20121145v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008559
21668,Relative humidity predicts day-to-day variations in COVID-19 cases in the city of Buenos Aires,"Possible links between the transmission of COVID-19 and meteorology have been investigated by comparing positive cases across geographical regions or seasons. Little is known, however, about the degree to which environmental conditions modulate the daily dynamics of COVID-19 spread at a given location. One reason for this is that individual waves of the disease are typically too abrupt, making it hard to isolate the contribution of meteorological cycles. To overcome this shortage, we here present a case study of the first wave of the outbreak in the city of Buenos Aires, which had a slow evolution of the case load extending along most of 2020. We found that humidity plays a prominent role in modulating the variation of COVID-19 positive cases through a negative-slope linear relationship, with an optimal lag of 9 days between the meteorological observation and the positive case report. This relationship is specific to winter months, when relative humidity predicts up to half of the variance in positive cases. Our results provide a tool to anticipate local surges in COVID-19 cases after events of low humidity. More generally, they add to accumulating evidence pointing to dry air as a facilitator of COVID-19 transmission.","Pineda Rojas, A. L.; Cordo, S. M.; Saurral, R. I.; Jimenez, J. L.; Marr, L.

12003,Do low TB prevalence and lack of BCG Vaccinations Contribute to Emergence Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children?,"BackgroundEmergence of new multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is thought to be associated with COVID-19 pandemic. Covid-19 morbidity and mortality variances among countries have been suggested by previous works to be influenced by BCG and previous latent TB infection (which is reflected by TB prevalence) possibly through inducing heterogeneous immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

AimTo examine influence of BCG status and TB prevalence on variances among countries which report new multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).

MethodsWe choose all countries which report MIS-C till 23/6/2020, number of cases for each 10 million inhabitants was examined among 3 categories of countries classified according to BCG program status. TB prevalence, MIS-C no. / 10 million (M) population and Covid-19 deaths/M are taken as markers. Receiver operation characteristic - (ROC) curve, with some relative indicators such as (sensitivity and specificity rates), estimation area of trade - off between sensitivity and specificity, and cutoff points are used with different studied markers for discriminating different three pairs of countries (which have different BCG practices).

ResultsBCG vaccinations and high TB prevalence are found to be associated with decrease MIS-C no. and COVID-19 deaths

ConclusionsFindings might explain variances in MIS-C incidence and in COVID-19 mortality among countries worldwide. Further studies to confirm this relation and to confirm possible similar relations in Kawasaki disease(KD) in previous epidemics is recommended.

What is Known- Although the etiology for KD remains unknown, available evidence supports the hypothesis that the pathogenesis is closely associated with dysregulation of immune responses to an infectious agent.

17518,Simulating Pandemic Disease Spread and the Impact of Interventions in Complex Societal Networks,"IntroductionProjecting disease spread is challenging because of the heterogeneous nature of human interactions, including both natural societal interactions and how they change in response to pandemics. Simulations can provide important guidance regarding the likely impact of interventions on an assumed base case.

MethodsThis paper uses assumptions based on the COVID-19 pandemic to construct a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model representative of US society, focusing on the interrelationships of groups with differing contact networks (essential/non-essential workers and urban/non-urban populations). The model is used to explore the impact of interventions (reduced interactions, vaccinations and selective isolation) on overall and group-specific disease spread.

ResultsIn the absence of herd immunity, temporary interventions will only reduce the overall number of disease cases moderately and spread them over a greater period of time unless they virtually eliminate disease and no new infections occur from exogenous sources. Vaccinations can provide stronger benefit, but can be limited by efficacy and utilization rates.

ConclusionsWhile a highly effective and broadly utilized vaccine might halt disease spread, some combination of increased long-term surveillance and selective isolation of the most vulnerable populations might be necessary to minimize morbidity and mortality if only moderately effective vaccines are available.","Mytelka, D.

3265,Effectiveness of Isolation Policies in Schools: Evidence from a Mathematical Model of Influenza and COVID-19,"BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, school closures and travel restrictions are often implemented to control outbreaks of infectious diseases. For influenza in schools, the Center of Disease Control (CDC) recommends that febrile students remain isolated at home until they have been fever-free for at least one day and a related policy is recommended for SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19). Other authors proposed using a school week of four or fewer days of in-person instruction for all students to reduce transmission. However, there is limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of these interventions.

MethodsWe introduced a mathematical model of school outbreaks that considers both intervention methods. Our model accounts for the school structure and schedule, as well as the time-progression of fever symptoms and viral shedding. The model was validated on outbreaks of seasonal and pandemic influenza and COVID-19 in schools. It was then used to estimate the outbreak curves and the proportion of the population infected (attack rate) under the proposed interventions.

ResultsFor influenza, the CDC-recommended one day of post-fever isolation can reduce the attack rate by a median (interquartile range) of 29 (13 - 59)%. With two days of post-fever isolation the attack rate could be reduced by 70 (55 - 85)%. Alternatively, shortening the school week to four and three days reduces the attack rate by 73 (64 - 88)% and 93 (91 - 97)%, respectively. For COVID-19, application of post-fever isolation policy was found to be less effective and reduced the attack rate by 10 (5 - 17)% for a two-day isolation policy and by 14 (5 - 26)% for 14 days. A four-day school week would reduce the median attack rate in a COVID-19 outbreak by 57 (52 - 64)%, while a three-day school week would reduce it by 81 (79 - 83)%. In both infections, shortening the school week significantly reduced the duration of outbreaks.

ConclusionsShortening the school week could be an important tool for controlling influenza and COVID-19 in schools and similar settings. Additionally, the CDC-recommended post-fever isolation policy for influenza could be enhanced by requiring two days of isolation instead of one.","Burns, A.; Gutfraind, A.",2020-11-23,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.26.20044750,2,Alexander Gutfraind,Loyola University Medical Center; University of Illinois at Chicago,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044750v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044750v2.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
19342,"A generic, scalable, and rapid TR-FRET -based assay for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has seen an unprecedented increase in the demand for rapid and reliable diagnostic tools, leaving many laboratories scrambling for resources. We present a fast and simple method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs. The method is based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) and S protein (SP) via time-resolved Forster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) with donor- and acceptor-labeled polyclonal anti-NP and -SP antibodies. Using recombinant proteins and cell culture-grown SARS-CoV-2 the limits of detection were established as 25 pg of NP or 20 infectious viral units (i.u.), and 875 pg of SP or 625 i.u. of SARS-CoV-2. Testing RT-PCR positive (n=48, with cycle threshold [Ct] values from 11 to 30) or negative (n=96) nasopharyngeal swabs, we showed that the assay yields positive results for all samples with Ct values of <25 and a single RT-PCR negative sample. We determined the presence of infectious virus in the RT-PCR-positive nasopharyngeal swabs by virus isolation, and observed a strong association between the presence of infectious virus and a positive antigen test result. The NP-based assay showed 97.4% (37/38) sensitivity and 100% (10/10) specificity in comparison with virus isolation, and 77.1% (37/48) and 99.0% (95/96) in comparison with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. The assay is performed in a buffer that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and is relatively simple to set up as an """"in-house"""" test. The assay principle as such is applicable to other viral infections, and could also be readily adapted to a massively high throughput testing format.","Rusanen, J.; Kareinen, L.; Szirovicza, L.; Ugurlu, H.; Levanov, L.; Jaaskelainen, A.

1966,A Peptide-based Magnetic Chemiluminescence Enzyme Immunoassay for Serological Diagnosis of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),"A respiratory illness has been spreading rapidly in China, since its outbreak in Wuhan city, Hubei province in December 2019. The illness was caused by a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical manifestations related to SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from no symptom to fatal pneumonia. World Health Organization (WHO) named the diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection as COVID-19. Real time RT-PCR is the only laboratory test available till now to confirm the infection. However, the accuracy of real time RT-PCR depends on many factors, including sampling location and of methods, quality of RNA extraction and training of operators etc.. Variations in these factors might significantly lower the sensitivity of the detection. We developed a peptide-based luminescent immunoassay to detect IgG and IgM. Cut-off value of this assay was determined by the detection of 200 healthy sera and 167 sera from patients infected with other pathogens than SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the performance of this assay, we detected IgG and IgM in the 276 sera from confirmed patients. The positive rate of IgG and IgM were 71.4% (197/276) and 57.2% (158/276) respectively. By combining with real time RT-PCR detection, this assay might help to enhance the accuracy of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Cai, X.; Chen, J.; Hu, J.; Long, Q.; Deng, H.; Fan, K.; Liao, P.; Liu, B.; Wu, G.; Chen, Y.; Li, Z.; Wang, K.; Zhang, X.; Tian, W.; Xiang, J.; Du, H.; Wang, J.; Hu, Y.; Tang, N.; Lin, Y.; Ren, J.; Huang, L.; Wei, J.; Gan, C.; Chen, Y.; Gao, Q.; Chen, A.; He, C.; Wang, D.; Hu, P.; Zhou, F.; Huang, A.; Liu, P.; Wang, D.",2020-02-25,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.02.22.20026617,1,Deqiang Wang,Chongqing Medical University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026617v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026617v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1093/infdis/jiaa243
11100,Characteristics and outcomes of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome related to COVID-19 in Belgian and French Intensive Care Units according to antiviral strategies. The COVADIS multicenter observational study.,"BackgroundLimited data are available for antiviral therapy efficacy especially for the most severe patients under mechanical ventilation suffering from Covid-19 related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).

MethodsObservational multicenter cohort of patients with moderate to severe Covid-19 ARDS, comparing antiviral strategies (none, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), lopinavir/ritonavir (L/R), others (combination or remdesivir). The primary end-point was the day-28 ventilator free days (VFD), patients which died before d28 were considered as having 0 VFD. The variable was dichotomized in patients still ventilated or dead at day 28 vs patients being extubated and alive at day 28 (VFD = or >0).

ResultsWe analyzed 376 patients (80 with standard of care (SOC), 49 treated with L/R, 197 with HCQ, and 50 others). The median number of d28-VFD was 0 (IQR 0-13) and was different across the different groups (P=0.01), the SOC patients having the highest d28-VFD. A multivariate logistic regression including antiviral strategies, showed that age (OR 0.95 CI95%:0.93-0.98), male gender (OR 0.53 CI95%:0.31-0.93), Charlson score (OR 0.85 CI95%:0.73-0.99) and plateau pressure (OR 0.94 CI95%:0.88-0.99) were associated with having 0 d28-VFD whereas P/F ratio (OR 1.005 CI95%:1.001-1.010) was associated with having [&ge;]1 d28-VFD (ie. being extubated and alive). Acute kidney injury (AKI) was frequent (64%), its incidence was different across the patients groups (P=0.01). In a post-hoc logistic multivariate regression apart from demographics characteristics and comorbidities, the use of L/R (administered to 81 of 376 patients was associated with occurrence of AKI (OR 2.07 CI95%:1.17-3.66) and need for renal replacement therapy (RRT).

ConclusionIn this observational study of moderate to severe Covid-19 ARDS patients, we did not observed a benefit of treating patients with any specific antiviral treatment. We observed an association between L/R treatment and occurrence of AKI and need for RRT.

Take home messageAny specific COVID-19 antiviral treatment is associated with higher ventilator free days at day 28 as compared to no antiviral treatment for patient in ICU under invasive mechanical ventilation. Lopinavir/ritonavir is associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury.

However, in China, traditional Chinese herbal medicines have provided therapeutic benefit to patients with COVID-19. Jinhua Qinggan granule (JHQGG) is a Chinese multi-herbal formula previously developed for the treatment of H1N1 influenza and has been encouraged for patients clinically suspected of COVID-19 during medical observation. However, the immunological mechanism for the efficacy of JHQGG has not been confirmed.

ObjectivesWe thus examined whether the administration of JHQGG affects hematological and immunological measures in healthy individuals.

MethodWe enrolled 18 healthy volunteers, all of whom tested negative for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Peripheral blood samples were collected 1 h after oral administration of JHQGG and subjected to hematological, biochemical, and cytokine tests.

ResultsJHQGG rapidly induced a significant decrease in the plasma level of IL-6 and an increase in the plasma level of IFN-{gamma}.

ConclusionsOur finding suggests that the therapeutic efficacy of JHQGG against COVID-19 is, in part, associated with its rapid immunomodulatory activity.","Kageyama, Y.; Aida, K.; Kawauchi, K.; Morimoto, M.; Ebisui, T.; Akiyama, T.; Nakamura, T.",2020-06-12,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.08.20124453,1,Tsutomu Nakamura,"Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, The University of Tokyo",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.08.20124453v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.08.20124453v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
21098,Covid-19 respiratory protection: the filtration efficiency assessment of decontaminated FFP2 masks responding to associated shortages,"During the Covid-19 pandemic, healthcare workers were extremely vulnerable to infection with the virus and needed continuous protection. One of the most effective and widely used means of protection was the FFP2 respirator. Unfortunately, this crisis created a shortage of these masks, prompting hospitals to explore opportunities to reuse them after decontamination.

An approach for assessing the filtration efficiency of decontaminated FFP2 masks has been proposed and applied to evaluate the possibilities of their safe reuse. The decontamination processes adopted are those based on moist heat or hydrogen peroxide. The approach introduces efficiency measures that define the filtration and protection capacity of the masks, which characterize both chemical and structural changes, and encompasses many techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The test protocol was applied to mask samples that had endured different decontamination cycles and the results of their efficiency measures were compared to brand-new masks performances.

The main result was that chemical and structural characterization of the decontaminated masks have shown no substantial change or deformation of their filter media structures. Indeed, the respiratory resistance test has shown that the results of both the FFP2 masks that have undergone a hydrogen peroxide disinfection cycle or a steam autoclave cycle remained constant with a small variation of 10 Pa from the EN149 standard. The chemical characterization, on the other hand, has shown that the filter media of the decontaminated masks remains unchanged, with no detectable chemical derivatives in its constituents.","Moussa, B.; Omokhtar, B.; Hmami, F.; El Mabrouk, K.; El Alami, L.; Arhoune, B.; Belahcen, M.

We conducted a population-based cohort study using public health data to describe COVID-19 associated age- and sex-specific acute care use, length of stay (LOS), and mortality.

MethodsWe used Ontarios Case and Contact Management (CCM) Plus database of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 in Ontario from March 1 to September 30, 2020 to determine age- and sex-specific hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) use, LOS, and mortality. We stratified analyses by month of infection to study temporal trends and conducted subgroup analyses by long-term care residency.

ResultsDuring the observation period, 56,476 COVID-19 cases were reported (72% < 60 years, 52% female). The proportion of cases shifted from older populations (> 60 years) to younger populations (10-39 years) over time. Overall, 10% of individuals were hospitalized, of those 22% were admitted to ICU, and 60% of those used IMV. Mean LOS for individuals in the ward, ICU without IMV, and ICU with IMV was 12.8, 8.5, 20.5 days, respectively. Mortality for individuals receiving care in the ward, ICU without IMV, and ICU with IMV was 24%, 30%, and 45%, respectively. All outcomes varied by age and decreased over time, overall and within age groups.

InterpretationThis descriptive study shows acute care use and mortality varying by age, and decreasing between March and September in Ontario.

In this study, a 3-6 month follow-up study was performed to examine serum levels of laboratory values in 107 discharged COVID-19 patients (mild = 59; severe/critical = 48; diagnoses on admission). 61 patients had a revisit chest CT scan. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyze changes in laboratory values. LDL-c and HDL-c levels were significantly higher at follow-up than at admission in severe/critical cases (p < 0.05). LDL-c levels were significantly higher at follow-up than at admission in mild cases (p < 0.05). With adjustment of the factor of traditional Chinese medicine, LDL-c and HDL-c levels were significantly improved at follow-up than at admission in severe/critical cases (p < 0.05). Increases in HDL-c significantly correlated with increases in numbers of white blood cells (p<0.001) and decreases in levels of C-reactive protein (p < 0.05) during patients recovery. Residue lesions were observed in CT images in 69% (42 of 61) of follow-up patients.

24591,Timing is everything: the relationship between COVID outcomes and the date at which mask mandates are relaxed,"ImportanceSeveral states including Texas and Mississippi have lifted their mask mandates, sparking concerns that this policy change could lead to a surge in cases and hospitalizations.

ObjectiveTo estimate the increase in incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths in Texas and Mississippi following the removal of mask mandates, and to evaluate the relative reduction of these outcomes if policy change is delayed by 90 days.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis study uses an age-stratified compartmental model parameterized to incidence data in Texas and Mississippi to simulate increased transmission following policy change in March or June 2021, and to estimate the resulting number of incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe increase in incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths if mask mandates are lifted on March 14 compared to lifting on June 12.

ResultsIf transmission is increased by 67% when mask mandates are lifted, we projected 11.39 (CrI: 11.22 - 11.55) million infections, 170,909 (CrI: 167,454 - 174,379) hospitalizations, and 5647 (5511 - 5804) deaths (Figure 1) in Texas from March 14 through the end of 2021. Delaying NPI lift until June reduces the average number of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths by 36%, 65%, and 62%, respectively. Proportionate differences were similar for the state of Mississippi. Peak hospitalization rates would be reduced by 79% and 63% in Texas and Mississippi, respectively.

Here, we performed a pilot study to assess the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in samples taken from 491 pre-epidemic individuals, 51 patients from Hopital Bichat (Paris), 209 pauci-symptomatic individuals in the French Oise region and 200 contemporary Oise blood donors.

We also developed two novel assays: the S-Flow assay, which is based on the recognition of S at the cell surface by flow-cytometry, and the LIPS assay that recognizes diverse antigens (including S1 or N C-terminal domain) by immunoprecipitation. Overall, the results obtained with the four assays were similar, with differences in sensitivity that can be attributed to the technique and the antigen in use. High antibody titers were associated with neutralisation activity, assessed using infectious SARS-CoV-2 or lentiviral-S pseudotypes. In hospitalized patients, seroconversion and neutralisation occurred on 5-14 days post symptom onset, confirming previous studies. Seropositivity was detected in 29% of pauci-symptomatic individuals within 15 days post-symptoms and 3 % of blood of healthy donors collected in the area of a cluster of COVID cases. Altogether, our assays allow for a broad evaluation of SARS-CoV2 seroprevalence and antibody profiling in different population subsets.","Grzelak, L.; Temmam, S.; Planchais, C.; Demeret, C.; Huon, C.; Guivel, F.; Staropoli, I.; Chazal, M.; Dufloo, J.; Planas, D.; Buchrieser, J.; Rajah, M.

25242,COVID-19 Vaccine Prioritisation in Japan and South Korea,"BackgroundDue to a limited initial supply of COVID-19 vaccines, the prioritisation of individuals for vaccination is of utmost importance for public health. Here, we provide the optimal allocation strategy for COVID-19 vaccines according to age in Japan and South Korea.

MethodsCombining national case reports, age-specific contact matrices, and observed periods between each stages of infection (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Quarantined), we constructed a compartmental model. We estimated the age-stratified probability of transmission given contact (qi) using Bayesian inference method and simulated different vaccination scenarios to reduce either case numbers or death toll. We also performed sensitivity analyses on the proportion of asymptomatic cases and vaccine efficacy.

FindingsThe model inferred age-stratified probability of transmission given contact (qi) showed similar age-dependent increase in Japan and South Korea. Assuming the reported COVID-19 vaccine efficacy, our results indicate that Japan and South Korea need to prioritise individuals aged 20-35 years and individuals aged over 60 years, respectively, to minimise case numbers. To minimise the death toll, both countries need to prioritise individuals aged over 75 years. These trends were not changed by proportions of asymptomatic cases and varying vaccine efficacy on individuals under 20 years.

InterpretationWe presented the optimal vaccination strategy for Japan and South Korea. Comparing the results of these countries demonstrates that not only the effective contact rates containing qi but also the age-demographics of current epidemic in Japan (dominance in 20s) and South Korea (dominant cases over 50s) affect vaccine allocation strategy.","Chun, J.

16229,"Scalable, effective, and rapid decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 contaminated N95 respirators using germicidal ultra-violet C (UVC) irradiation device","ImportanceParticulate respirators such as N95 masks are an essential component of personal protective equipment (PPE) for front-line workers. This study describes a rapid and effective UVC irradiation system that would facilitate the safe re-use of N95 respirators and provides supporting information for deploying UVC for decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID19 pandemic.

ObjectiveTo assess the inactivation potential of the proposed UVC germicidal device as a function of time by using 3M(R) 8211 - N95 particulate respirators inoculated with SARS-CoV-2.

DesignA germicidal UVC device to deliver tailored UVC dose was developed and snippets (2.5cm2) of the 3M-N95 respirator were inoculated with 106 plaque-forming units (PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 and were UV irradiated. Different exposure times were tested (0-164 seconds) by fixing the distance between the lamp (10 cm) and the mask while providing an exposure of at least 5.43 mWcm-2.

SettingThe current work is broadly applicable for healthcare-settings, particularly during a pandemic such as COVID-19.

ParticipantsNot applicable.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Primary measure of outcome was titration of infectious virus recovered from virus-inoculated respirator pieces after UVC exposure. Other measures included the method validation of the irradiation protocol, using lentiviruses (biosafety level-2 agent) and establishment of the germicidal UVC exposure protocol.

ResultsAn average of 4.38x103 PFUml-1(SD 772.68) was recovered from untreated masks while 4.44x102 PFUml-1(SD 203.67), 4.00x102 PFUml-1(SD 115.47), 1.56x102 PFUml-1(SD 76.98) and 4.44x101 PFUml-1(SD 76.98) was recovered in exposures 2s,6s,18s and 54 seconds per side respectively. The germicidal device output and positioning was monitored and a minimum output of 5.43 mWcm-2 was maintained. Infectious SARS-CoV-2 was not detected by plaque assays (minimal level of detection is 67 PFUml-1) on N95 respirator snippets when irradiated for 120s per side or longer suggesting 3.5 log reduction in 240 seconds of irradiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceA scalable germicidal UVC device to deliver tailored UVC dose for rapid decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 was developed. UVC germicidal irradiation of N95 snippets inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 for 120s per side resulted in 100% (3.5 log in total) reduction of virus. These data support the reuse of N95 particle-filtrate apparatus upon irradiation with UVC and supports use of UVC-based decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 virus during the COVID19 pandemic.","Rathnasinghe, R.; Karlicek, R.

2685,Roles of meteorological conditions in COVID-19 transmission on a worldwide scale,"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has caused great damage to public health and economy worldwide with over 140,000 infected cases up to date. Previous research has suggested an involvement of meteorological conditions in the spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, such as influenza. However, as for the recent novel coronavirus, few studies have discussed systematically about the role of daily weather in the epidemic transmission of the virus. Here, we examine the relationships of meteorological variables with the severity of the outbreak on a worldwide scale. The confirmed case counts, which indicates the severity of COVID-19 spread, and four meteorological variables, i.e., air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and visibility, were collected daily between January 20 and March 11 (52 days) for 430 cities and districts all over China, 21 cities/provinces in Italy, 21 cities/provinces in Japan, and 51 other countries around the world. Four different time delays of weather (on the day, 3 days ago, 7 days ago, and 14 days ago) as to the epidemic situation were taken for modeling and we finally chose the weather two weeks ago to model against the daily epidemic situation as its correlated with the outbreak best. Taken Chinese cities as a discovery dataset, it was suggested that temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity combined together could best predict the epidemic situation. The meteorological model could well predict the outbreak around the world with a high correlation (r2>0.6) with the real data. Using this model, we further predicted the possible epidemic situation in the future 12 days in several high-latitude cities with potential outbreak. This model could provide more information for governments future decisions on COVID-19 outbreak control.","Chen, B.; Liang, H.; Yuan, X.; Hu, Y.; Xu, M.; Zhao, Y.; Zhang, B.; Tian, F.; Zhu, X.",2020-10-10,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.16.20037168,2,Xuejun Zhu,"Department of Hematology, Research Center of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of C",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037168v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037168v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
6528,The Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on Liver Injury in China: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"BackgroundThe evidence for the incidence and severity of liver injury in Chinese patients with COVID-19 is still controversial.

AimsThe purpose of this study was to summarize the incidence of liver injury and the differences between liver injury markers among different patients with COVID-19 in China.

MethodsComputer searches of PubMed, Embase, CNKI and medRxiv were used to obtain reports on the incidence and markers of liver injury in Chinese patients with COVID-19, from January 1, 2020 to April 10, 2020. (No. CRD42020181350)

ResultsA total of 57 reports from China were included, including 9889 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. The results of the meta-analysis showed that among the patients with early COVID-19 infection in China, the incidence of liver injury events was 24.7% (95% CI, 23.4%-26.4%). Liver injury in severe patients was more common than that in non-severe patients, with a risk ratio of 2.07 (95% CI, 1.77 to 2.43). Quantitative analysis showed that the severe the coronavirus infection, the higher the level of AST, ALT, TB, ALP, GGT and the lower the level of ALB. The changing trend of the appeal index was similar in ICU patients and dead patients.

ConclusionThere is a certain risk of liver injury in Chinese patients with COVID-19, and the risk and degree of liver injury are related to the severity of COVID-19.","Zhao, X.; Lei, Z.",2020-05-08,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.03.20089557,1,Zehua Lei,"1.

20466,Prediction of confirmed and death cases of Covid-19 in Chile through time series techniques: A comparative study,"(1) BackgroundChile has become one of the countries most affected by Covid-19, a pandemic that has generated a large number of cases worldwide, which if not detected and treated in time can cause multi-organic failure and even death. The social determinants of health such as education, work, social security, housing, environment, support networks and social cohesion are important aspects to consider for the control and intervention of this pathology. Therefore, it is essential to have information about the progress of the infections at the national level and thus apply effective public health interventions. In this paper, we compare different time series methodologies to predict the number of confirmed cases and deaths from Covid-19 in Chile and thus support the decisions of health agencies;

(2) MethodsWe modeled the confirmed cases and deaths from Covid-19 in Chile by using ARIMA models, exponential smoothing techniques, Poisson models for time-dependent counting data. In addition, we evaluated the accuracy of the predictions by using a training set and test set;

(3) ResultsThe database used in this paper allows us to say that for the confirmed Covid-19 cases the best model corresponds to a well-known Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time-series model, whereas for deaths from Covid-19 in Chile the best model resulted in damped trend method;

(4) ConclusionARIMA models are an alternative to model the behavior of the spread of Covid19, however, and depending on the characteristics of the data set, other methodologies can better capture the behavior of these records, for example, Holt-winters method and time-dependent counting models.","Barria-Sandoval, C.; Ferreira, G.; Benz-Parra, K.; Lopez-Flores, P.",2021-01-05,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.12.31.20249085,1,Claudia Barria-Sandoval,Universidad de las Americas,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.31.20249085v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.31.20249085v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
25417,COVID-19 vaccination acceptance among healthcare workers in Germany,"BackgroundVaccination hesitancy is a serious threat to achieve herd immunity in a global and rapidly changing pandemic situation. Health care workers play a key role in the treatment of patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and in promoting vaccination in the general population. The aim of the study was to provide data on COVID-19 vaccination acceptance and barriers among healthcare workers in Germany to support health policymakers choosing specific vaccination campaign strategies.

MethodsAn online survey was conducted among health care workers in Germany in February 2021. The survey included 55 items on demographics, previous vaccination behavior, trust in vaccines, physicians, pharma industry, and health politics as well as fear of adverse effects, assumptions on disease consequences, knowledge about vaccines, information seeking behavior and a short COVID-19 vaccine knowledge test.

ResultsA total of 4500 surveys could be analyzed. The overall vaccination acceptance was 91.7%. The age group [&le;]20 years showed the lowest vaccination acceptance of all age groups. Regarding professional groups, residents showed the highest vaccination acceptance. Main factors for vaccination hesitancy were lack of trust in authorities and pharmaceutical companies. Personal and professional environment influenced the attitude towards a vaccination too. Participants with vaccination hesitancy were more likely to obtain information about COVID-19 vaccines via messenger services or online video platforms and underperformed in the knowledge test.

ConclusionsIn conclusion, we found a high acceptance rate amongst German health care workers. Furthermore, several factors associated with vaccination hesitancy were identified which could be targeted in vaccination campaigns.","Holzmann-Littig, C.; Braunisch, M.

Existing protocols have relied on scientifically questionable evidence and might not lead to the optimal balance between public health safety and airlines financial viability.

ObjectiveTo explore the implementation feasibility of Thai Airways International protocol from the perspectives of passengers and aircrews.

DesignAn online questionnaire survey of passengers and an in-depth interview with aircrews.

SettingTwo randomly selected repatriation flights operated by Thai Airways International using Boeing 777 aircraft (TG476 from Sydney and TG492 from Auckland to Bangkok)

Participants377 Thai passengers and 35 aircrews.

ResultsThe mean age of passengers was 28.14 (95%CI 26.72 to 29.55) years old; 57.03% were female. TG492 passengers were mostly students and significantly younger than that of TG476 (p<0.0001) with comparable flying experience (p=0.1192). The average body temperature was 36.52 (95%CI 36.48 to 36.55) degrees Celsius. Passengers estimated average physical distances of 1.59 (95%CI 1.48 to 1.70), 1.41 (95%CI 1.29 to 1.53), and 1.26 (95%CI 1.12 to 1.41) meters at check-in, boarding, and in-flight, respectively. Passengers were checked for body temperature during the flight 1.97 (95%CI 1.77 to 2.18) times on average which is significantly more frequent in longer than shorter flight (p<0.0001). Passengers moved around or went to the toilet during the flight 2.00 (95%CI 1.63 to 2.37) and 2.08 (95%CI 1.73 to 2.43) times which are significantly more frequent in longer than shorter flight (p=0.0186 and 0.0049, respectively).

11055,Comparison of two commercial platforms and a laboratory developed test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA,"Mitigation of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic requires reliable and accessible laboratory diagnostic services. We evaluated the performance of one LDT and two commercial tests, cobas(R) SARS-CoV-2 (Roche) and Amplidiag(R) COVID-19 (Mobidiag), for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory specimens. 183 specimens collected from suspected COVID-19 patients were studied with all three methods to compare their performance. In relation to the reference standard, which was established as the result obtained by two of the three studied methods, the positive percent agreement (PPA) was highest for cobas(R) test (100%), followed by Amplidiag(R) test and the LDT (98.9%). The negative percent agreement (NPA) was lowest for cobas(R) test (89.4%), followed by Amplidiag(R) test (98.8%) and the highest value was obtained for LDT (100%). The dilution series conducted for specimens, however, suggests significantly higher sensitivity for the cobas(R) assay in comparison with the other two assays and the low NPA value may be due to the same reason. In general, all tested assays performed adequately. Both the time from sample to result and hands-on time per sample were shortest for cobas(R) test. Clinical laboratories need to be prepared for uninterrupted high-throughput testing during the coming months in mitigation of the pandemic. To secure that, it is of critical importance for clinical laboratories to maintain several simultaneous platforms in their SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing.","Mannonen, L.; Kallio-Kokko, H.; Loginov, R.; Jaaskelainen, A.; Jokela, P.; Antikainen, J.; Vare, P.; Kekalainen, E.; Kurkela, S.; Jarva, H.; Lappalainen, M.",2020-07-06,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.07.03.20144758,1,Laura Mannonen,"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.20144758v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.20144758v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.jmoldx.2021.01.005
23915,Limit of detection in different matrices of nineteen commercially available rapid antigen tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2,"In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic there has been an increase of the use of antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT). The performance of Ag-RDT vary greatly between manufacturers and evaluating their analytical limit of detection (LOD) has become high priority. Here we describe a manufacturer-independent evaluation of the LOD of 19 marketed Ag-RDT using live SARS-CoV-2 spiked in different matrices: direct culture supernatant, a dry swab, and a swab in Amies. Additionally, the LOD using dry swab was investigated after 7 days storage at -80{degrees}C of the SARS-CoV-2 serial dilutions. An LOD of {approx} 5.0 x 102 pfu/ml (1.0 x 106 genome copies/ml) in culture media is defined as acceptable by the World Health Organization. Fourteen of nineteen Ag-RDTs (ActiveXpress, Espline, Excalibur, Innova, Joysbio, Mologic, NowCheck, Orient, PanBio, RespiStrip, Roche, Standard-F, Standard-Q and Sure-Status) exceeded this performance criteria using direct culture supernatant applied to the Ag-RDT. Six Ag-RDT were not compatible with Amies media and a decreased sensitivity of 2 to 20-fold was observed for eleven tests on the stored dilutions at -80{degrees}C for 7 days.

5510,"Demographic and Socio-Economic Factors, and Healthcare Resource Indicators Associated with the Rapid Spread of COVID-19 in Northern Italy: An Ecological Study","BackgroundCOVID-19 rapidly escalated into a pandemic, threatening 213 countries, areas, and territories the world over. We aimed to identify potential province-level socioeconomic determinants of the viruss dissemination, and explain between-province differences in the speed of its spread, based on data from 36 provinces of Northern Italy.

MethodsThis is an ecological study. We included all confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 reported between February 24th and March 30th, 2020. For each province, we calculated the trend of contagion as the relative increase in the number of individuals infected between two time endpoints, assuming an exponential growth. Pearsons test was used to correlate the trend of contagion with a set of healthcare-associated, economic, and demographic parameters by province. The viruss spread was input as a dependent variable in a stepwise OLS regression model to test the association between rate of spread and province-level indicators.

FindingsMultivariate analysis showed that the spread of COVID-19 was correlated negatively with aging index (p-value=0.003), and positively with public transportation per capita (p-value=0.012), the % of private long-term care hospital beds and, to a lesser extent (p-value=0.070), the % of private acute care hospital beds (p-value=0.006).

InterpretationDemographic and socioeconomic factors, and healthcare organization variables were found associated with a significant difference in the rate of COVID-19 spread in 36 provinces of Northern Italy. An aging population seemed to naturally contain social contacts. The availability of healthcare resources and their coordination could play an important part in spreading infection.","Buja, A.; Paganini, M.; Cocchio, S.; Scioni, M.; Rebba, V.; Baldo, V.",2020-04-29,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.04.25.20078311,1,Matteo Paganini,"Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20078311v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20078311v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1371/journal.pone.0244535
17378,Prevalence and outcomes of co-infection and super-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"IntroductionThe recovery of other respiratory viruses in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported, either at the time of a SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis (co-infection) or subsequently (superinfection). However, data on the prevalence, microbiology and outcomes of co-infection and super infection are limited. The purpose of this study was to examine occurrence of respiratory co-infections and superinfections and their outcomes among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Patients and MethodsWe searched literature databases for studies published from October 1, 2019, through June 11, 2020. We included studies that reported clinical features and outcomes of co-infection or super-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. We followed PRISMA guidelines and we registered the protocol with PROSPERO as: CRD42020189763.

ResultsOf 1310 articles screened, 48 were included in the random effects meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of co-infection was 12% (95% confidence interval (CI): 6%-18%, n=29, I2=98%) and that of super-infection was 14% (95% CI: 9%-21%, n=18, I2=97%). Pooled prevalence of pathogen type stratified by co- or super-infection: viral co-infections, 4% (95% CI: 2%-7%); viral super-infections, 2% (95% CI: 0%-7%); bacterial co-infections, 4% (95% CI: 1%-8%); bacterial super-infections, 6% (95% CI: 2%-11%); fungal co-infections, 4% (95% CI: 1%-8%); and fungal super-infections, 4% (95% CI: 0%-11%). Compared to those with co-infections, patients with super-infections had a higher prevalence of mechanical ventilation [21% (95% CI: 13%-31%) vs. 7% (95% CI: 2%-15%)] and greater average length of hospital stay [mean=12.5 days, standard deviation (SD) =5.3 vs. mean=10.2 days, SD= 6.7].

ConclusionsOur study showed that as many as 14% of patients with COVID-19 have super-infections and 12% have co-infections. Poor outcomes were associated with super-infections. Our findings have implications for diagnostic testing and therapeutics, particularly in the upcoming respiratory virus season in the Northern Hemisphere.","Musuuza, J.

4837,Controlled Avalanche: A Regulated Voluntary Exposure Approach for Addressing Covid19,"BackgroundThe ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has driven many countries to take radical suppression measures. While reducing mortality, these measures result in severe economic repercussions, and inhibit the development of herd immunity. Until an effective vaccine will be available, we propose an alternative approach, akin to avalanche control at ski resorts, a practice which intentionally triggers small avalanches in order to prevent a singular catastrophic one. Its main goal is to approach herd immunity faster than the current alternatives, with lower mortality rates and lower demand for critical health-care resources. According to this approach, individuals whose probability of developing serious health conditions is low (i.e. 20-49 years old with no comorbidities) will be offered the option to be voluntarily exposed to the virus under controlled supervision, and will then be issued  immunity certificates if they are confirmed to have developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

MethodsUsing a compartmental model we examine the implications of the controlled avalanche (CA) strategy over the population in Israel. We compare four scenarios: in two scenarios the CA program is applied to the low-risk population (with the rest of the population subject to mitigation measures), followed by mitigation for the entire population or by uncontrolled spread. These are compared to mitigated and uncontrolled scenarios without the CA program. We discuss the economic, ethical and public health implications of the CA strategy.

FindingsWe show that compared to mitigation of the entire population, the CA strategy reduces the overall mortality by 43%, reduces the maximum number of people in need for ICUs by 62% and decreases the time required for release of 50% of the low-risk population by more than 2 months.

InterpretationThis study suggests an ethically acceptable practice, that enables reaching herd immunity faster than the current alternatives, with low mortality and minimal economic damage.","Klement, E.; Klement, A.; Chinitz, D.; Harel, A.; Fattal, E.; Klausner, Z.",2020-04-22,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.12.20062687,1,Eyal Klement,"Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.12.20062687v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.12.20062687v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
2556,Relationship between the ABO Blood Group and the COVID-19 Susceptibility,"The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading around the world rapidly and declared as a pandemic by WHO. Here, we compared the ABO blood group distribution in 2,173 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 test from three hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China with that in normal people from the corresponding regions. The results showed that blood group A was associated with a higher risk for acquiring COVID-19 compared with non-A blood groups, whereas blood group O was associated with a lower risk for the infection compared with non-O blood groups. This is the first observation of an association between the ABO blood type and COVID-19. It should be emphasized, however, that this is an early study with limitations. It would be premature to use this study to guide clinical practice at this time, but it should encourage further investigation of the relationship between the ABO blood group and the COVID-19 susceptibility.","Zhao, J.; Yang, Y.; Huang, H.; Li, D.; Gu, D.; Lu, X.; Zhang, Z.; Liu, L.; Liu, T.; Liu, Y.; He, Y.; Sun, B.; Wei, M.; Yang, G.; Wang, X.; Zhang, L.; Zhou, X.; Xing, M.; Wang, P.

17935,COVID-19 detection on IBM quantum computer with classical-quantum transfer learning,"Diagnose the infected patient as soon as possible in the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak which is declared as a pandemic by the world health organization (WHO) is extremely important. Experts recommend CT imaging as a diagnostic tool because of the weak points of the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). In this study, the detection of COVID-19 from CT images, which give the most accurate response in a short time, was investigated in the classical computer and firstly in quantum computers. Using the quantum transfer learning method, we experimentally perform COVID-19 detection in different quantum real processors (IBMQx2, IBMQ-London and IBMQ-Rome) of IBM, as well as in different simulators (Pennylane, Qiskit-Aer and Cirq). By using a small number of data sets such as 126 COVID-19 and 100 Normal CT images, we obtained a positive or negative classification of COVID-19 with 90% success in classical computers, while we achieved a high success rate of 94-100% in quantum computers. Also, according to the results obtained, machine learning process in classical computers requiring more processors and time than quantum computers can be realized in a very short time with a very small quantum processor such as 4 qubits in quantum computers. If the size of the data set is small; Due to the superior properties of quantum, it is seen that according to the classification of COVID-19 and Normal, in terms of machine learning, quantum computers seem to outperform traditional computers.","Acar, E.; Yilmaz, I.",2020-11-10,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.11.07.20227306,1,Erdi Acar,"Department of Computer Engineering, Institute of Science, Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.07.20227306v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.07.20227306v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
13612,COVID-19 among nursing staff: Settings and regional differences,"PurposeThis study was carried out to describe settings of and regional differences in the occurrence of COVID-19 among nursing staff, analysing COVID-19 symptoms, testing and diagnosis procedures.

DesignWe used an online survey to conduct this cross-sectional study among nursing staff in different settings. Data collection was carried out between 12 May and 13 July 2020.

MethodsThe survey included questions that allowed us to collect demographic data (e.g. age), professional qualifications (e.g. nurse, nurse aid) and data regarding the federal states and settings in which the participants worked. In additon, we asked the participants to describe their COVID-19 symptoms, if any were experienced, and the result of COVID-19 testing that they underwent. We used descriptive statistics as well as bivariate analysis methods to calculate differences.

FindingsMore than 80% of the nursing staff (N = 2600) were women, nearly half of these staff members worked in the province of Styria and about three-quarters worked in hospitals. In general, nearly every sixth nurse reported experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. We found statistically significant differences between the settings and the federal provinces with regard to the COVID-19 symptoms reported, but not the test results. The highest porportion of nurses who experienced symptoms worked in lower Austria and in the primary care sector. In total, 1.6% of the participating nurses were tested for COVID-19, as well as about 1% of the nurses who worked in the nursing homes. The highest number of tests were carried out in Vienna followed by the province of Burgenland. In total, all of the nurses who underwent testing were diagnosed with COVID-19.

ConclusionsOnly 1% of the nurses who worked in nursing homes were tested. This group of nurses takes care of the most vulnerable and high-risk group in Austrian society.

Therefore, the nursing home staff should have the possibility to be tested even though they did not experience/report any symptoms. The highest prorportion of nurses who experienced symptoms worked in the primary care sector. In the future during a pandemic, health care staff should be comprehensively tested in all settings.

Clinical RelevanceProviding insights into COVID-19 symptoms experienced by nursing staff workforce and testing for COVID-19 can help us address these aspects in future pandemics more efficiently. In addition, these insights can help to shift the perspectives from critical and acute settings to other settings, e.g. nursing homes. This is an important change in perspectives, as these nurses have worked with the most vulnerable and high-risk group during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ensuring the safety of nursing home residents and providing, high-quality nursing care and interventions can reduce hospital admission rates, decrease health care costs during such pandemics and might even reduce secondary morbidity and mortality.","Hoedl, M.; Eglseer, D.; Bauer, S.",2020-08-17,Nursing,10.1101/2020.08.14.20174797,1,Manuela Hoedl,"Institute of Nursing Science, Medical University of Graz",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20174797v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20174797v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
5212,What can trends in hospital deaths from COVID-19 tell us about the progress and peak of the pandemic? An analysis of death counts from England announced up to 25 April 2020,"BackgroundReporting of daily hospital COVID-19 deaths in the UK are promoted by the government and scientific advisers alike as a key metric for assessing the progress in the control of the epidemic. These data, however, have certain limitations, among which one of the most significant concerns the fact that the daily totals span deaths that have occurred between 1 and 10 days or more in the past.

Data and methodsWe obtained daily data published published by NHS England up to and including April 25 in the form of Excel spreadsheets in which deaths counts are presented by date of death according to age and region. Simple descriptive analyses were conducted and presented in graphical and tabular form which were aimed at illustrating the biases inherent in focussing on daily counts regardless of when the deaths occurred. We then looked at how a less biased picture could be obtained by looking at trends in death counts stratifying by individual period of delay in days between occurrence of death and when the death was included in the daily announcement.

FindingsThe number of hospital COVID-19 deaths announced daily overestimates the maximum number of deaths actually occurring so far in the epidemic in the UK, and also obscures the pattern of decline in deaths. Taking account of reporting delays suggests that for England as a whole a peak in hospital COVID-19 deaths may have been reached on April 8 with a subsequent gradual decline suggested. The same peak is also seen among those aged 60-79 and 80+, although there is slightly shallower decline in the oldest age group (80+ years). Among those aged 40-59 years a later peak on April 11 is evident. London shows a peak on April 8 and a clearer and steeper pattern of subsequent decline compared to England as a whole.

InterpretationAnalyses of mortality trends must take account of delay, and in communication with the public more emphasis should be placed on looking at trends based on deaths that occurred 5 or more days prior to the announcement day. The slightly weaker decline seen at age 80+ may reflect increased hospitalisation of people from care homes, whereas the later peak under the age of 60 years may reflect the higher proportions at these younger ages being admitted to critical care resulting in an extension of life of several days.

19398,Model-based evaluation of school- and non-school-related measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic,"BackgroundIn autumn 2020, many countries, including the Netherlands, are experiencing a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Health policymakers are struggling with choosing the right mix of measures to keep the COVID-19 case numbers under control, but still allow a minimum of social and economic activity. The priority to keep schools open is high, but the role of school-based contacts in the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 is incompletely understood. We used a transmission model to estimate the impact of school contacts on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and to assess the effects of school-based measures, including school closure, on controlling the pandemic at different time points during the pandemic.

Methods and FindingsThe age-structured model was fitted to age-specific seroprevalence and hospital admission data from the Netherlands during spring 2020. Compared to adults older than 60 years, the estimated susceptibility was 23% (95%CrI 20--28%) for children aged 0 to 20 years and 61% (95%CrI 50%--72%) for the age group of 20 to 60 years. The time points considered in the analyses were (i) August 2020 when the effective reproduction number (Re) was estimated to be 1.31 (95%CrI 1.15--2.07), schools just opened after the summer holidays and measures were reinforced with the aim to reduce Re to a value below 1, and (ii) November 2020 when measures had reduced Re to 1.00 (95%CrI 0.94--1.33). In this period schools remained open. Our model predicts that keeping schools closed after the summer holidays, in the absence of other measures, would have reduced Re by 10% (from 1.31 to 1.18 (95%CrI 1.04--1.83)) and thus would not have prevented the second wave in autumn 2020. Reducing non-school-based contacts in August 2020 to the level observed during the first wave of the pandemic would have reduced Re to 0.83 (95%CrI 0.75--1.10). Yet, this reduction was not achieved and the observed Re in November was 1.00. Our model predicts that closing schools in November 2020 could reduce Re from the observed value of 1.00 to 0.84 (95%CrI 0.81--0.90), with unchanged non-school based contacts. Reductions in Re due to closing schools in November 2020 were 8% for 10 to 20 years old children, 5% for 5 to 10 years old children and negligible for 0 to 5 years old children.

ConclusionsThe impact of measures reducing school-based contacts, including school closure, depends on the remaining opportunities to reduce non-school-based contacts. If opportunities to reduce Re with non-school-based measures are exhausted or undesired and Re is still close to 1, the additional benefit of school-based measures may be considerable, particularly among the older school children.","Rozhnova, G.; Van Dorp, C.

4274,Neuropsychiatric adverse events of chloroquine: A real-world pharmacovigilance study using the FAERS database,"ObjectivesAs of the early April 2020, the antimalarial drug, chloroquine, has been approved as an emergency treatment for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States and in Europe. Although infrequent, neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients who received chloroquine for the treatment of malaria or autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated these adverse events (AEs) using a large self-reporting database.

Materials and MethodsWe conducted a disproportionality analysis for the detection of neuropsychiatric AE signals associated with the use of chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), reported to FAERS database between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted reporting odds ratio (ROR) for the development of each of the neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine was calculated using a multilevel model.

ResultsWe included 2,389,474 AE cases, among which 520 cases developed neuropsychiatric AE following the use of chloroquine. Exposure to chloroquine was associated with a statistically significant high reporting of amnesia, delirium, hallucinations, depression, and loss of consciousness, (lower 95% confidence interval of the adjusted ROR > 1), although the degree of increase in their ROR was limited. There was no statistically significant high reporting of any other neuropsychiatric AE, including suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation.

ConclusionCurrent pharmacovigilance study results did not suggest any potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation, which would be informative during the emergency use of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.","Sato, K.; Mano, T.; Iwata, A.; Toda, T.",2020-04-14,Neurology,10.1101/2020.04.10.20061358,1,Atsushi Iwata,Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Medical Center Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20061358v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20061358v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.5582/bst.2020.03082
24721,Molecular Profiling of COVID-19 Autopsies Uncovers Novel Disease Mechanisms,"BackgroundCurrent understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology is limited by disease heterogeneity, complexity, and a paucity of studies evaluating patient tissues with advanced molecular tools.

MethodsAutopsy tissues from two COVID-19 patients, one of whom died after a month-long hospitalization with multi-organ involvement while the other died after a few days of respiratory symptoms, were evaluated using multi-scale RNASeq methods (bulk, single-nuclei, and spatial RNASeq next-generation sequencing) to provide unprecedented molecular resolution of COVID-19 induced damage.

FindingsComparison of infected/uninfected tissues revealed four major regulatory pathways. Effectors within these pathways could constitute novel therapeutic targets, including the complement receptor C3AR1, calcitonin-like receptor or decorin. Single-nuclei RNA sequencing of olfactory bulb and prefrontal cortex highlighted remarkable diversity of coronavirus receptors. Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 was rarely expressed, while Basignin showed diffuse expression, and alanyl aminopeptidase was associated with vascular/mesenchymal cell types. Comparison of lung and lymph node tissues from patients with different symptomatology with Digital Spatial Profiling resulted in distinct molecular phenotypes.

InterpretationCOVID-19 is a far more complex and heterogeneous disease than initially anticipated. Evaluation of COVID-19 rapid autopsy tissues with advanced molecular techniques can identify pathways and effectors at play in individual patients, measure the staggering diversity of receptors in specific brain areas and other well-defined tissue compartments at the single-cell level, and help dissect differences driving diverging clinical courses among patients. Extension of this approach to larger datasets will substantially advance the understanding of the mechanisms behind COVID-19 pathophysiology.

FundingNo external funding was used in this study.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSInformation regarding changes seen in COVID-19 has accumulated very rapidly over a short period of time. Studies often rely on examination of normal samples and model systems, or are limited to peripheral blood or small biopsies when dealing with tissues collected from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. For that reason, autopsy studies have become an important source of insights into the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19 disease, highlighting the emerging role of hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable syndromes. Studies of autopsy tissues, however, are usually limited to histopathologic and immunohistochemical evaluation. The next frontier in understanding COVID-19 mechanisms of disease will require generation of highly dimensional, patient-specific datasets that can help dissect this complex and heterogeneous disease.

Added value of this studyOur work illustrates how high-resolution molecular and spatial profiling of COVID-19 patient tissues collected during rapid autopsies can serve as a hypothesis-generating tool to identify key mediators driving the pathophysiology of COVID-19 for diagnostic and therapeutic target testing. Here we employ bulk RNA sequencing to identify key regulators of COVID-19 and list specific mediators for further study as potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets. We use single-nuclei RNA sequencing to highlight the diversity and heterogeneity of coronavirus receptors within the brain, suggesting that it will be critical to expand the focus from ACE2 to include other receptors, such as BSG and ANPEP, and we perform digital spatial profiling of lung and lymph node tissue to compare two patients with different clinical courses and symptomatology.

Implications of all the available evidenceCOVID-19 is a far more heterogeneous and complex disease than initially anticipated. Advanced molecular tools can help identify specific pathways and effectors driving the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and lead to novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in a patient-specific manner. Larger studies representing the diversity of clinical presentations and pre-existing conditions will be needed to capture the full complexity of this disease.","Pujadas, E.; Beaumont, M.; Shah, H.; Schrode, N.; Francoeur, N.; Shroff, S.; Bryce, C.; Grimes, Z.; Gregory, J.; Donnelly, R.; Fowkes, M.; Beaumont, K.; Sebra, R.; Cordon-Cardo, C.",2021-04-07,Pathology,10.1101/2021.04.04.21253205,1,Carlos Cordon-Cardo,Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.04.21253205v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.04.21253205v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
5520,Forecast analysis of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in the United States by a generalized fractional-order SEIR model,"In this paper, a generalized fractional-order SEIR model is proposed, denoted by SEIQRP model, which has a basic guiding significance for the prediction of the possible outbreak of infectious diseases like COVID-19 and other insect diseases in the future. Firstly, some qualitative properties of the model are analyzed. The basic reproduction number R0 is derived. When R0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium point is unique and locally asymptotically stable. When R0 > 1, the endemic equilibrium point is also unique. Furthermore, some conditions are established to ensure the local asymptotic stability of disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. The trend of COVID-19 spread in the United States is predicted. Considering the influence of the individual behavior and government mitigation measurement, a modified SEIQRP model is proposed, defined as SEIQRPD model. According to the real data of the United States, it is found that our improved model has a better prediction ability for the epidemic trend in the next two weeks. Hence, the epidemic trend of the United States in the next two weeks is investigated, and the peak of isolated cases are predicted. The modified SEIQRP model successfully capture the development process of COVID-19, which provides an important reference for understanding the trend of the outbreak.","Xu, C.; Yu, Y.; Chen, Y.; Lu, Z.",2020-05-03,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.24.20078493,2,Yangquan Chen,University of California Merced,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.24.20078493v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.24.20078493v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1007/s11071-020-05946-3

10087,Critical care demand and intensive care supply for patients in Japan with COVID-19 at the time of the state of emergency declaration in April 2020: a descriptive analysis.,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), threatened to overwhelm Japans intensive care capacity due to the rising numbers of infected patients. This study aimed to determine the number of critically ill patients with COVID-19 who required intensive care, including mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), during the pandemic and to compare these patient numbers with Japans overall intensive care capacity.

MethodsJapanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine datasets were used to obtain the number of confirmed patients with COVID-19 who had undergone mechanical ventilation and ECMO between February 15 and June 4 2020, to determine and compare intensive care unit (ICU) and attending bed needs for patients with COVID-19, and to estimate peak ICU demands in Japan.

ResultsIn total, 17968 ICU days, 15171 mechanical ventilation days, and 2797 ECMO days were attributable to patients with COVID-19. There was a median (interquartile range) 143 (63-255) patients in ICU, 124 (51-225) patients on mechanical ventilation, and 18 (15-36) patients on ECMO machines. During the epidemic peak in late April, 11443 patients (1.03 per 10000 adults) had been infected, 373 patients (0.034 per 10000 adults) were in ICU, 312 patients (0.028 per 10000 adults) were receiving mechanical ventilation, and 62 patients (0.0056 per 10000 adults) were on ECMO machines per day. The number of infected patients at the peak of the epidemic was 651% of total designated beds and the number of patients requiring intensive care at the peak of the epidemic was 6.0% of total ICU beds in Japan, 19.1% of total board-certified intensivists in Japan and 106% of total designated medical institutions for Category II infectious diseases in Japan, respectively.

ConclusionsFollowing the state of emergency declaration on April 7 2020, the number of patients with COVID-19 and the number of critically ill patients continued to rise, exceeding the number of designated beds but not exceeding ICU capacity. Urgent nationwide and regional planning is needed to prevent an overwhelming burden on ICUs in relation to critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Japan.","Fujii, Y.; Hirota, K.",2020-10-03,Intensive Care And Critical Care Medicine,10.1101/2020.06.20.20136150,2,Yosuke Fujiii,Kansai Medical University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.20136150v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.20136150v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3390/medicina56100530
18569,A Data Driven Change-point Epidemic Model for Assessing the Impact of Large Gathering and Subsequent Movement Control Order on COVID-19 Spread in Malaysia,"The second wave of COVID-19 in Malaysia is largely attributed to a mass gathering held in Sri Petaling between February 27, 2020 and March 1, 2020, which contributed to an exponential rise of COVID-19 cases in the country. Starting March 18, 2020, the Malaysian government introduced four consecutive phases of a Movement Control Order (MCO) to stem the spread of COVID-19. The MCO was implemented through various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The reported number of cases reached its peak by the first week of April and then started to reduce, hence proving the effectiveness of the MCO. To gain a quantitative understanding of the effect of MCO on the dynamics of COVID-19, this paper develops a class of mathematical models to capture the disease spread before and after MCO implementation in Malaysia. A heterogeneous variant of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model is developed with additional compartments for asymptomatic transmission. Further, a change-point is incorporated to model the before and after disease dynamics, and is inferred based on data. Related statistical analyses for inference are developed in a Bayesian framework and are able to provide quantitative assessments of (1) the impact of the Sri Petaling gathering, and (2) the extent of decreasing transmission during the MCO period. The analysis here also quantitatively demonstrates how quickly transmission rates fall under effective NPI implemention within a short time period.","Dass, S. C.; Kwok, W. M.; Gibson, G. J.; Gill, B.

7380,"Predictors of COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and epidemic growth rate at the country level","BackgroundThe burden of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been geographically disproportionate. Certain weather factors and population characteristics are thought to drive transmission, but studies examining these factors are limited. We aimed to identify weather, sociodemographic, and geographic drivers of COVID-19 at the global scale using a comprehensive collection of country/territory-level data, and to use discovered associations to estimate the timing of community transmission.

MethodsWe examined COVID-19 cases and deaths reported up to May 2, 2020 across 205 countries and territories in relation to weather data collected from capital cities for the eight weeks prior to and four weeks after the date of the first reported case, as well as country/territory-level population, geographic, and planetary data. We performed univariable and multivariable regression modeling and odds ratio analyses to investigate associations with COVID-19 cases, deaths, and epidemic growth rate. We also conducted maximum likelihood analysis to estimate the timing of initial community spread.

FindingsLower temperature (p<0.0001), lower humidity (p=0.006), higher altitude (p=0.0080), higher percentage of urban population (p<0.0001), increased air travelers (p=0.00019), and higher prevalence of obesity (p<0.0001) were strong independent predictors of national COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and epidemic growth rate. Temperature at 5-7 weeks before the first reported case best predicted epidemic growth, suggesting that significant community transmission was occurring on average 1-2 months prior to detection.

ConclusionsThe results of this ecologic analysis demonstrate that global COVID-19 burden and timing of country-level epidemic growth can be predicted by weather and population factors. In particular, we find that cool, dry, and higher altitude environments, as well as more urban and obese populations, may be conducive to more rapid epidemic spread.","Leung, N. Y.; Bulterys, M.

23943,Factors influencing COVID-19 vaccination uptake in an elderly sample in Poland,"BackgroundsThis research represents an investigation into potential predictors for the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccination in Poland, following the instigation of policies to encourage the over-seventies to be vaccinated.

MethodsIndividuals participated in cross-sectional structured interviews. 1427 respondents were questioned for determining vaccination uptake, revealing attitudes regarding vaccination, where information was sourced from, health status and behavior, demographics and socio-economic profiles.

ResultsSelected predictors for acceptance of the vaccination were: being talked through the importance of the vaccination and potential side-effects by a medical professional; sharing living space with others; having a high ranking occupation; suffering from chronic illnesses; being able to access medical services by driving or walking rather than using public transport or relying on others. Those who opted not to be vaccinated most frequently justify their decision by saying that they were concerned about the efficacy of the vaccine or that they were worried about side-effects.

ConclusionsIt appears that the current nationwide campaign has successfully raised awareness regarding the vaccine, but this research indicates that a more information-based campaign, focusing on evidence of the vaccines efficacy and the non-serious nature of all side-effects, could lead to improved uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine.","Malesza, M.; Bozym, M.",2021-03-23,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.03.21.21254047,1,Marta Malesza,University of Economics and Human Sciences in Warsaw,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.21.21254047v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.21.21254047v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA

DesignA pilot randomized controlled trial.

SettingHubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Wuhan, China

PatientsA total of 42 adults with severe COVID-19.

InterventionsParticipants in the CHM plus standard care group received CHM and standard care, and the control group received standard care alone.

Measurements and Main ResultsThe primary outcome was the change in the disease severity category of COVID-19 after treatment at 7 days. Among 42 participants who were randomized (mean [SD] age 60.43 years [12.69 years]; 21 [50%] were aged [&ge;] 65 years; and 35 [83%] women, 42 (100%) had data available for the primary outcome. For the primary outcome, one patient from each group died during treatment; the odds of a shift towards death was lower in the CHM plus group than the standard care alone group (common OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.148 to 2.352 P=.454). Three (2 from the CHM plus group and 1 from the standard care alone group) patients progressed from severe to critical illness. After treatment, mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 disease accounted for 18% (5) vs 14% (2), 71% (20) vs 64% (9), and 0% (0) vs 7% (1) of the patients treated with CHM plus standard care vs. standard care alone.

ConclusionsFor the first time, the G-CHAMPS trial provided valuable information for the national guideline-based CHM treatment for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19.

9575,They stumble that run fast: the economic and COVID-19 transmission impacts of reopening industries in the US,"COVID-19 has laid bare the United States economically and epidemiologically. Decisions must be made as how and when to reopen industries. Here we quantify economic and health risk tradeoffs of reopening by industry for each state in the US. To estimate total economic impact, we summed income loss due to unemployment and profit loss. We assess transmission risk by: (1) workplace size, (2) human interactions, (3) inability to work from home, and (4) industry size. We found that the industry with the highest estimated economic impact from COVID-19 was manufacturing in 40 states; the industry with the largest transmission risk index was accommodation and food services in 41 states, and the industry with the highest economic impact per unit of transmission risk, interpreted as the value of reopening, was manufacturing in 37 states. Researchers and decision makers must work together to consider both health and economics when making tough decisions.

12338,Healthcare Workers' Mental Health and Wellbeing During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the UK: Contrasting Guidelines with Experiences in Practice,"BackgroundSubstantial evidence has highlighted the importance of considering healthcare workers (HCW) mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and several organisations have issued guidelines with recommendations. However, the definition of wellbeing and the evidence-base behind such guidelines remains unclear.

ObjectivesAssessing the applicability of wellbeing guidelines in practice; identifying unaddressed HCWs needs; and providing recommendations for supporting frontline staff during the current and future pandemics.

Methods and DesignThis paper discusses the findings of a qualitative study based on interviews with frontline healthcare staff in the UK and examines them in relation to a rapid review of wellbeing guidelines developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Results14 guidelines were included in the rapid review and 33 interviews with HCWs were conducted in the qualitative study. As a whole, the guidelines placed greater emphasis on wellbeing at an individual level, while HCWs placed greater emphasis on structural conditions at work, such as understaffing and the invaluable support of the community. This in turn had implications for the focus of wellbeing intervention strategies; staff reported an increased availability of formal mental health support, however, understaffing or clashing schedules prevented them from participating in these activities.

ConclusionHCWs expressed wellbeing needs which align with social-ecological conceptualisations of wellbeing related to quality of life. This approach to wellbeing has been highlighted in literature about HCWs support in previous health emergencies, yet it has not been monitored during this pandemic. Wellbeing guidelines should explore staffs needs and contextual characteristics affecting the implementation of recommendations.","Vera San Juan, N.; Aceituno, D.; Djellouli, N.; Sumray, K.; Regenold, N.; Syversen, A.; Mulcahy Symmons, S.; Dowrick, A.; Mitchinson, L.; Singleton, G.; Vindrola-Padros, C.",2020-07-26,Health Systems And Quality Improvement,10.1101/2020.07.21.20156711,1,Norha Vera San Juan,"Insitute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience.

17215,Serologic SARS-CoV-2 testing in healthcare workers with positive RT-PCR test or Covid-19 related symptoms,"BackgroundLimited information is available on prevalence and determinants of serologic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers (HCWs).

MethodsWe analyzed the results of serologic testing with chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer (CLIA), lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test among 544 HCWs with at least one positive RT-PCR test and 157 HCWs with Covid-19 related symptoms without a positive RT-PCR test from public hospitals in Bologna, Northern Italy. Tests were performed between March and August 2020. We fitted multivariate logistic regression models to identify determinants of positive serology.

ResultsThe sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 was 75.2% (LFIA) and 90.6% (CLIA). No differences in seropositivity were observed by sex, while older HCWs had higher positivity than other groups, and nurses had higher positivity compared to physicians, but not other HCWs. An estimated 73.4% of HCWs with Covid-19 symptoms without RT-PCR test were not infected with SARS-CoV-2.

ConclusionsOur study provides the best available data on sensitivity of serologic tests and on determinants of serologic response among HCWs positive for SARS-CoV-2, and provide evidence on the low specificity of Covid-19 related symptoms to identify infected HCWs.

SummaryThe sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow immunoassay serology in healthcare workers (HCWs) was 75.2%. Older HCWs and nurses had higher positivity than other groups. An estimated 73.4% of HCWs with Covid-19 symptoms without RT-PCR test were not infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Visci, G.; Lodi, V.; Bonfiglioli, R.; Lazzarotto, T.; Violante, F.

While first-generation antibody tests have primarily provided qualitative results with low specificity, accurate seroprevalence studies and tracking of antibody levels over time require highly specific, sensitive and quantitative test setups. Here, we describe two quantitative ELISA antibody tests based on the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain and the nucleocapsid protein. Comparative expression in bacterial, insect, mammalian and plant-based platforms enabled the identification of new antigen designs with superior quality and high suitability as diagnostic reagents. Both tests scored excellently in clinical validations with multi-centric specificity and sensitivity cohorts and showed unprecedented correlation with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers. Orthogonal testing increased assay specificity to 99.8%, thereby enabling robust serodiagnosis in low-prevalence settings. The inclusion of a calibrator permits accurate quantitative monitoring of antibody concentrations in samples collected at different time points during the acute and convalescent phase of COVID-19.","Klausberger, M.; Duerkop, M.; Haslacher, H.; Wozniak-Knopp, G.; Cserjan-Puschmann, M.; Perkmann, T.; Lingg, N.; Aguilar, P.

8431,COVID-19 in Multiple Sclerosis Patients and Risk Factors for Severe Infection,"ImportanceMultiple sclerosis patients have been considered a higher-risk population for COVID-19 due to the high prevalence of disability and disease-modifying therapy use; however, no study has identified clinical characteristics of multiple sclerosis associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the clinical characteristics of multiple sclerosis, including staging, degree of disability, and disease-modifying therapy use that are associated with worse outcomes from COVID-19.

DesignProspective cohort study looking at the outcomes of multiple sclerosis patients with COVID-19 between March 1st and May 18th 2020.

SettingThis is a multicenter study of three distinct hospital systems within the U.S.

ParticipantsThe study included 40 consecutive patients with nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection.

ExposuresMultiple sclerosis staging, severe disability (based on baseline-extended disability status scale equal to or greater than 6.0) and disease-modifying therapy.

Main Outcomes and MeasureSeverity of COVID-19 infection was based on hospital course, where a mild course was defined as the patient not requiring hospital admission, moderate severity was defined as the patient requiring hospital admission to the general floor only, and most severe was defined as requiring intensive care unit admission and/or death.

ResultsFor the 40 patients, the median age was 52(45.5-61) years, 16/40(40%) were male, and 21/40(52.5%) were African American. 19/40(47.5%) had mild courses, 15/40(37.5%) had moderate courses, and 6/40(15%) had severe courses. Patients with moderate and severe courses were significantly older than those with a mild course (57[50-63] years old and 66[58.8-69.5] years old vs 48[40-51.5] years old, P=0.0121, P=0.0373). There was differing prevalence of progressive multiple sclerosis staging in those with more severe courses (severe:2/6[33.3%]primary-progressing and 0/6[0%]secondary-progressing, moderate:1/14[7.14%] and 5/14[35.7%] vs mild:0/19[0%] and 1/19[5.26%], P=0.0075, 1 unknown). Significant disability was found in 1/19(5.26%) mild course-patients, but was in 9/15(60%, P=0.00435) of moderate course-patients and 2/6(33.3%, P=0.200) of severe course-patients. Disease-modifying therapy prevalence did not differ among courses (mild:17/19[89.5%], moderate:12/15[80%] and severe:3/6[50%], P=0.123).

Conclusions and RelevanceMultiple sclerosis patients with more severe COVID-19 courses tended to be older, were more likely to suffer from progressive staging, and had a higher degree of disability. However, disease-modifying therapy use was not different among courses.","Chaudhry, F.; Bulka, H.; Rathnam, A. S.; Said, O. M.; Lin, J.; Lorigan, H.; Bernitsas, E.; Rube, J.; Korzeniewski, S.

16703,Repurposed antiviral drugs for COVID-19; interim WHO SOLIDARITY trial results,"BACKGROUNDWHO expert groups recommended mortality trials in hospitalized COVID-19 of four re-purposed antiviral drugs.

METHODSStudy drugs were Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir (fixed-dose combination with Ritonavir) and Interferon-{beta}1a (mainly subcutaneous; initially with Lopinavir, later not). COVID-19 inpatients were randomized equally between whichever study drugs were locally available and open control (up to 5 options: 4 active and local standard-of-care). The intent-to-treat primary analyses are of in-hospital mortality in the 4 pairwise comparisons of each study drug vs its controls (concurrently allocated the same management without that drug, despite availability). Kaplan-Meier 28-day risks are unstratified; log-rank death rate ratios (RRs) are stratified for age and ventilation at entry.

RESULTSIn 405 hospitals in 30 countries 11,266 adults were randomized, with 2750 allocated Remdesivir, 954 Hydroxychloroquine, 1411 Lopinavir, 651 Interferon plus Lopinavir, 1412 only Interferon, and 4088 no study drug. Compliance was 94-96% midway through treatment, with 2-6% crossover. 1253 deaths were reported (at median day 8, IQR 4-14). Kaplan-Meier 28-day mortality was 12% (39% if already ventilated at randomization, 10% otherwise). Death rate ratios (with 95% CIs and numbers dead/randomized, each drug vs its control) were: Remdesivir RR=0.95 (0.81-1.11, p=0.50; 301/2743 active vs 303/2708 control), Hydroxychloroquine RR=1.19 (0.89-1.59, p=0.23; 104/947 vs 84/906), Lopinavir RR=1.00 (0.79-1.25, p=0.97; 148/1399 vs 146/1372) and Interferon RR=1.16 (0.96-1.39, p=0.11; 243/2050 vs 216/2050). No study drug definitely reduced mortality (in unventilated patients or any other subgroup of entry characteristics), initiation of ventilation or hospitalisation duration.

CONCLUSIONSThese Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir and Interferon regimens appeared to have little or no effect on hospitalized COVID-19, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay. The mortality findings contain most of the randomized evidence on Remdesivir and Interferon, and are consistent with meta-analyses of mortality in all major trials. (Funding: WHO.

13734,Convalescent plasma for patients with severe COVID-19: a matched cohort study,"BackgroundThe efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) for the treatment of COVID-19 remains unclear.

MethodsA matched cohort analysis of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. The impact of CP treatment on all cause in-hospital mortality was evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards models, and the impact of CP treatment on the time to hospital discharge was assessed using a stratified log-rank analysis.

Results64 patients who received CP a median of 7 days after symptom onset were compared to a matched control group of 177 patients. Overall in-hospital mortality was 14.9%. There was no significant difference in the risk of in-hospital mortality between the two groups (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39 - 2.20). There was also no significant difference in the overall rate of hospital discharge (rate ratio [RR] 1.28, 95% CI 0.91 - 1.81), but a subgroup analysis of patients 65-years-old or greater who received CP demonstrated a significantly increased hospital discharge rate among these patients (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.03 - 3.36). There was a greater than expected frequency of transfusion reactions in the CP group (2.8% reaction rate observed per unit transfused).

ConclusionsThe use of CP in this study was a safe treatment for COVID-19. There was no overall significant reduction of in-hospital mortality or increased rate of hospital discharge associated with the use of CP in this study, although there was a signal for improved outcomes among the elderly. Further adequately powered randomized studies should target this subgroup when assessing the efficacy CP treatment.","Rogers, R.; Shehadeh, F.; Mylona, E.; Rich, J.; Neill, M.; Touzard-Romo, F.; Geffert, S.; Larkin, J.; Bailey, J.

4799,"A Randomized, Single-blind, Group sequential, Active-controlled Study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of α-Lipoic acid for critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19)","ObjectTo evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of -Lipoic acid (ALA) for critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

MethodsA randomized, single-blind, group sequential, active-controlled trial was performed at JinYinTan Hospital, Wuhan, China. Between February 2020 and March 2020, 17 patients with critically ill COVID-19 were enrolled in our study. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ALA (1200 mg/d, intravenous infusion) once daily plus standard care or standard care plus equal volume saline infusion (placebo) for 7 days. All patients were monitored within the 7 days therapy and followed up to day 30 after therapy. The primary outcome of this study was the Sequential Organ Failure Estimate (SOFA) score, and the secondary outcome was the all-cause mortality within 30 days.

ResultNine patients were randomized to placebo group and 8 patients were randomized to ALA group. SOFA score was similar at baseline, increased from 4.3 to 6.0 in the placebo group and increased from 3.8 to 4.0 in the ALA group (P=0.36) after 7 days. The 30-day all-cause mortality tended to be lower in the ALA group (3/8, 37.5%) compared to that in the placebo group (7/9, 77.8%, P=0.09).

ConclusionIn our study, ALA use is associated with lower SOFA score increase and lower 30-day all-cause mortality as compared with the placebo group. Although the mortality rate was two-folds higher in placebo group than in ALA group, only borderline statistical difference was evidenced due to the limited patient number. Future studies with larger patient cohort are warranted to validate the role of ALA in critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Zhong, M.; Sun, A.; Xiao, T.; Yao, G.; Sang, L.; Zheng, X.; Zhang, J.; Jin, X.; Xu, L.; Yang, W.; Wang, P.; Hu, K.; Zhang, D.; Ge, J.",2020-04-21,Pharmacology And Therapeutics,10.1101/2020.04.15.20066266,1,Junbo Ge,"Department of Cardiology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University.

5051,"Clinical characteristics of imported and second-generation COVID-19 cases outside Wuhan, China: A multicenter retrospective study","BackgroundThe mortality of COVID-19 differs between countries and regions. By now, reports on COVID-19 are largely focused on first-generation cases. This study aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of imported and second-generation cases.

MethodsThis retrospective, multicenter cohort study included 134 confirmed COVID-19 cases from 9 cities outside Wuhan. Epidemiological, clinical and outcome data were extracted from medical records and were compared between severe and non-severe cases. We further profiled the dynamic laboratory findings of some patients.

Results34.3% of the 134 patients were severe cases, and 11.2% had complications. As of March 7, 2020, 91.8% patients were discharged and one patient (0.7%) died. The median age was 46 years. The median interval from symptom onset to hospital admission was 4.5 (IQR 3-7) days. The median lymphocyte count was 1.1x109/L. Age, lymphocyte count, CRP, ESR, DBIL, LDH, HBDH showed difference between severe and no-severe cases (all P<0.05). Baseline lymphocyte count was higher in the survived patients than in the non-survivor case, and it increased as the condition improved, but declined sharply when death occurred. The IL-6 level displayed a downtrend in survivors, but rose very high in the death case. Pulmonary fibrosis was found on later chest CT images in 51.5% of the pneumonia cases.

ConclusionImported and second-generation cases outside Wuhan had a better prognosis than initial cases in Wuhan. Lymphocyte count and IL-6 level could be used for evaluating prognosis. Pulmonary fibrosis as the sequelae of COVID-19 should be taken into account.

SummaryImported and second-generation cases manifested less complications, lower fatality, and higher discharge rate than initial cases, which may be related to the shorter interval from symptom onset to hospital admission, younger age, and higher lymphocyte count of the imported and second-generation patients. Lymphocyte count and IL-6 level could be used as indicators for evaluating prognosis. Pulmonary fibrosis was found in later chest CT images in more than half of the pneumonia cases and should be taken into account.","Shi, P.; Ren, G.; Yang, J.; Li, Z.; Deng, S.; Li, M.; Wang, S.; Xu, X.; Chen, F.; Li, Y.; Li, C.; Yang, X.; Xie, Z.; Wu, Z.; Chen, M.",2020-04-23,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.19.20071472,1,Mingwei Chen,Xi\'an Jiaotong UNiversity,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.19.20071472v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.19.20071472v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
14796,EARLY VIRAL CLEARANCE AMONG COVID-19 PATIENTS WHEN GARGLING WITH POVIDONE-IODINE AND ESSENTIAL OILS: A PILOT CLINICAL TRIAL,"BackgroundGargling had been reported to have significant roles in the prevention and treatment of respiratory tract infections. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of regular gargling to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 in the oropharynx and nasopharynx.

MethodologyThis pilot, open labeled, randomized, parallel study compared the effect of 30 seconds, 3 times/day gargling using 1% povidone-iodine (PVP-I), essential oils and tap water on SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance among COVID-19 patients in a tertiary hospital in Kuala Lumpur. Progress was monitored by day 4,6 and 12 PCR (Ct value), gargling and symptoms diary as well as clinical observations.

ResultsFive confirmed Stage 1 COVID-19 patients were recruited for each arm. The age range was from 22 to 56 years old. The majority were males. Two respondents had co-morbidities, which were asthma and obesity. Viral clearance was achieved at day 6 in 100%, 80%, 20% and 0% for 1% PVP-I, essential oils, tap water and control group respectively. Analysis of 1% PVP-I group versus control group showed significant p-value for comparison of PCR results on Day 4, Day 6 and Day 12.

ConclusionsThis preliminary study showed that gargling with 1% PVP-I and essential oils show great potential to be part of the treatment and management of Stage 1 COVID-19. Larger studies are required to ascertain the benefit of gargling for different stages of COVID-19 patients. This study was registered in clinicaltrial.gov (NCT04410159).","Mohamed, N.

6892,MIGRANTS IN TRANSIT AND ASYLUM SEEKERS IN MEXICO: AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC,"BACKGROUNDMigrants could be disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, yet little is known so far of the epidemiology of the disease among them, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

OBJECTIVETo describe the epidemiology of suspect cases of COVID-19 in migrants in transit and asylum seekers in Mexico, and to compare their characteristics with those of non-migrants.

METHODSThis was a secondary analysis of information from the surveillance system of Mexico from January 1 to May 3 2020, identifying persons from the main sending countries of mixed migrant flows in Mexico (Central America, the Caribbean, Venezuela and African countries), in northern and southern Mexican border states. We compared the demographic and clinical characteristics, risk conditions, and epidemic curves for migrants and non-migrants. Also, we estimated the cumulative incidence for non-migrants, and for migrants in two scenarios defined by different estimations of their population size.

RESULTSMigrants were on average younger, had less accompanying risk conditions, and a lower percentage of suspect cases tested positive for COVID-19. The odds of hospitalization were lower among migrants, but the difference disappeared after adjusting by age, gender and underlying risk conditions. The cumulative incidence ratios comparing migrants with non-migrants were 6.12 (CI95% 4.75,7.77) for the first scenario, and 1.49 (CI95% 1.15,1.89) for the second scenario.

CONCLUSIONMigrants and asylum seekers in Mexico are at increased risk for infectious respiratory diseases, and could be disproportionately affected by COVID-19. It is important to continue monitoring the situation, with more detailed information about migration status, living conditions and other determinants of migrants health.","Bojorquez, I.; Infante, C.; Vieitez, I.; Larrea, S.; Santoro, C.",2020-05-13,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.05.08.20095604,1,Ietza Bojorquez,El Colegio de la Frontera Norte,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.08.20095604v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.08.20095604v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
7132,"The SARS-CoV-2 T-cell immunity is directed against the spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid protein and associated with COVID 19 severity","Identification of immunogenic targets of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for monitoring of antiviral immunity and vaccine design. Currently, mainly anti-spike (S)-protein adaptive immunity is investigated. However, also the nucleocapsid (N)- and membrane (M)-proteins should be considered as diagnostic and prophylactic targets.

The aim of our study was to explore and compare the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 S-, M- and N-proteins in context of different COVID-19 manifestations. Analyzing a cohort of COVID-19 patients with moderate, severe, and critical disease severity, we show that overlapping peptide pools (OPP) of all three proteins can activate SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells with a stronger response of CD4+ compared to CD8+ T-cells. Although interindividual variations for the three proteins were observed, M-protein induced the highest frequencies of CD4+ T-cells, suggesting its relevance as diagnostic and vaccination target. Importantly, patients with critical COVID-19 demonstrated the strongest T-cell response, including the highest frequencies of cytokine-producing bi- and trifunctional T-cells, for all three proteins. Although the higher magnitude and superior functionality of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells in critical patients can also be a result of a stronger immunogenicity provided by severe infection, it disproves the hypothesis of insufficient SARS-CoV-2-reactive immunity in critical COVID-19. To this end, activation of effector T-cells with differentiated memory phenotype found in our study could cause hyper-reactive response in critical cases leading to immunopathogenesis. Conclusively, since the S-, M-, and N-proteins induce T-cell responses with individual differences, all three proteins should be evaluated for diagnostics and therapeutic strategies to avoid underestimation of cellular immunity and to deepen our understanding of COVID-19 immunity.","Thieme, C.

4235,A Stratified Model to Quantify the Effects of Containment Policies on the Spread of COVID-19,"BackgroundThe SARS-Cov-2 virus is spreading fast all over the world and has already imposed a significant social and economic cost in many countries. Different countries have utilised a variety of containment policies with an emphasis on social distancing as a strategy to stop the spread of COVID-19. Quantifying the effects of such policies in different time-scales and comparing the efficacy of various available policies is of utmost importance for policy-makers in different countries. That is even more important when the policy-makers want to plan for long-term strategies and to weigh each option based on its epidemiological effects and socio-economic costs. In the absence of detailed knowledge of the interactions between individuals in a population and the characteristics of the SARS-Cov-2 virus, quantifying the effects of these policies is very difficult. Hence, there is an immediate need for models that can predict the spread of COVID-19 in a population, without the need for such detailed information.

The MethodIn this manuscript, a method is presented that can be used to predict the spread of COVID-19 in any country and under any containment policy imposed separately on different groups in the population. The method tunes the parameters of a known stratified model based on the available data on the spread of COVID-19. The model includes a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and is easy to simulate and easy to understand. As it is presented in this manuscript, the population is divided into age-groups. But given the availability of the data, there is no reason to limit the stratification into only age-groups and we can consider any relevant groups. To estimate the parameters of the model such that it reflects the characteristics of the spread of COVID-19 in a population, the method relies on an optimisation scheme. More specifically, the optimisation scheme estimates the contact rates between different age groups in the population. But a very important and useful feature of the model is that the estimated parameters for one population can be translated and used for any other population with a known age-structure, which in this day and age, includes almost any country or city in the world. Also, it is shown that the method is quite insensitive to the underlying assumptions in the optimisation scheme and also to deliberate or non-deliberate errors that might have occurred in collecting the data.

ResultsThe capabilities of the model are demonstrated using a case study under different containment policies, from an uncontained population to mitigation and suppression policies. Also, we can use the model to quantify the effects of strategies which include switching between different containment policies at pre-determined points in time. The model allows us to quantify the effects of each of these policies on the spread of the disease in a population, in particular, the instantaneous and total numbers of infectious individuals in a population which are important parameters for policy-makers. The simulation results, as explained in the following, provide some insight into various policies and some of the results are possibly counter-intuitive for many people. For example, the model predicts that closing down schools and universities without any other containment policy imposed on older age-groups has almost no impact on the number of patients that might need support-care in hospitals. The method provides an easy-to-use tool to use the information collected on the spread of COVID-19 in a country or region and then use that information in another population which might not have been as widely affected by the disease yet.","Bokharaie, V.

11648,Neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19: a nationwide registry,"BackgroundThe clinical description of the neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients is still underway. This study aims to provide an overview of the spectrum, characteristics and outcomes of neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsWe conducted a nationwide, multicentric, retrospective study during the French COVID-19 epidemic in March-April 2020. All COVID-19 patients with de novo neurological manifestations were eligible.

ResultsWe included 222 COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations from 46 centers throughout the country. Median age was 65 years (IQR 53-72), and 136 patients (61.3%) were male. COVID-19 was severe or critical in almost half of the patients (102, 45.2%). The most common neurological diseases were COVID-19 associated encephalopathy (67/222, 30.2%), acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome (57/222, 25.7%), encephalitis (21/222, 9.5%), and Guillain-Barre Syndrome (15/222, 6.8%). Neurological manifestations appeared after first COVID-19 symptoms with a median (IQR) delay of 6 (3-8) days in COVID-19 associated encephalopathy, 7 (5-10) days in encephalitis, 12 (7-18) days in acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome and 18 (15-28) days in Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Brain imaging was performed in 192 patients (86.5%), including 157 MRI (70.7%). Brain MRI of encephalitis patients showed heterogeneous acute non vascular lesion in 14/21 patients (66.7%) with associated small ischemic lesion or microhemorrhages in 4 patients. Among patients with acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome, 13/57 (22.8%) had multi territory ischemic strokes, with large vessel thrombosis in 16/57 (28.1%). Cerebrospinal fluid was analyzed in 97 patients (43.7%), with pleocytosis in 18 patients (18.6%). A SARS-CoV-2 PCR was performed in 75 patients and was positive only in 2 encephalitis patients. Among patients with encephalitis, ten out of 21 (47.6%) fully recovered, 3 of whom received corticosteroids (CS). Less common neurological manifestations included isolated seizure (8/222, 3.6%), critical illness neuropathy (8/222, 3.6%), transient alteration of consciousness (5/222, 2.3%), intracranial hemorrhage (5/222, 2.3%), acute benign lymphocytic meningitis (3/222, 1.4%), cranial neuropathy (3/222, 1.4%), single acute demyelinating lesion (2/222, 0.9%), Tapia syndrome (2/222, 0.9%), cerebral venous thrombosis (1/222, 0.5%), sudden paraparesis (1/222, 0.5%), generalized myoclonus and cerebellar ataxia (1/222, 0.5%), bilateral fibular palsy (1/222, 0.5%) and isolated neurological symptoms (headache, anosmia, dizziness, sensitive or auditive symptoms, hiccups, 15/222, 6.8%). The median (IQR) follow-up of the 222 patients was 24 (17-34) days with a high short-term mortality rate (28/222, 12.6%).

ConclusionNeurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 mainly included CAE, AICS, encephalitis and GBS.

24996,REACT-1 round 10 report: Level prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 swab-positivity in England during third national lockdown in March 2021,"BackgroundIn England, hospitalisations and deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 have been falling consistently since January 2021 during the third national lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. The first significant relaxation of that lockdown occurred on 8 March when schools reopened.

MethodsThe REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study augments routine surveillance data for England by measuring swab-positivity for SARS-CoV-2 in the community. The current round, round 10, collected swabs from 11 to 30 March 2021 and is compared here to round 9, in which swabs were collected from 4 to 23 February 2021.

ResultsDuring round 10, we estimated an R number of 1.00 (95% confidence interval 0.81, 1.21). Between rounds 9 and 10 we estimated national prevalence has dropped by [~]60% from 0.49% (0.44%, 0.55%) in February to 0.20% (0.17%, 0.23%) in March. There were substantial falls in weighted regional prevalence: in South East from 0.36% (0.29%, 0.44%) in round 9 to 0.07% (0.04%, 0.12%) in round 10; London from 0.60% (0.48%, 0.76%) to 0.16% (0.10%, 0.26%); East of England from 0.47% (0.36%, 0.60%) to 0.15% (0.10%, 0.24%); East Midlands from 0.59% (0.45%, 0.77%) to 0.19% (0.13%, 0.28%); and North West from 0.69% (0.54%, 0.88%) to 0.31% (0.21%, 0.45%). Areas of apparent higher prevalence remain in parts of the North West, and Yorkshire and The Humber. The highest prevalence in March was found among school-aged children 5 to 12 years at 0.41% (0.27%, 0.62%), compared with the lowest in those aged 65 to 74 and 75 and over at 0.09% (0.05%, 0.16%). The close approximation between prevalence of infections and deaths (suitably lagged) is diverging, suggesting that infections may have resulted in fewer hospitalisations and deaths since the start of widespread vaccination.

ConclusionWe report a sharp decline in prevalence of infections between February and March 2021. We did not observe an increase in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 following the reopening of schools in England, although the decline of prevalence appears to have stopped. Future rounds of REACT-1 will be able to measure the rate of growth or decline from this current plateau and hence help assess the effectiveness of the vaccination roll-out on transmission of the virus as well as the potential size of any third wave during the ensuing months.","Riley, S.; Eales, O.; Haw, D.; Walters, C.

22823,A statewide analysis of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in New York,"New York State, in particular the New York City metropolitan area, was the early epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the United States. Similar to initial pandemic dynamics in many metropolitan areas, multiple introductions from various locations appear to have contributed to the swell of positive cases. However, representation and analysis of samples from New York regions outside the greater New York City area were lacking, as were SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the earliest cases associated with the Westchester County outbreak, which represents the first outbreak recorded in New York State. The Wadsworth Center, the public health laboratory of New York State, sought to characterize the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 across the entire state of New York from March to September with the addition of over 600 genomes from under-sampled and previously unsampled New York counties and to more fully understand the breadth of the initial outbreak in Westchester County. Additional sequencing confirmed the dominance of B.1 and descendant lineages (collectively referred to as B.1.X) in New York State. Community structure, phylogenetic, and phylogeographic analyses suggested that the Westchester outbreak was associated with continued transmission of the virus throughout the state, even after travel restrictions and the on-pause measures of March, contributing to a substantial proportion of the B.1 transmission clusters as of September 30th, 2020.","Lasek-Nesselquist, E.; Singh, N.; Russell, A.; Lamson, D.; Kelly, J.; Plitnick, J.; Pfeiffer, R.

3383,The COVID-19 infection in Italy: a statistical study of an abnormally severe disease,"We statistically investigate the Coronavirus Disease 19 (hereinafter Covid-19) epidemics, which is particularly invasive in Italy. We show that the high apparent mortality (or Case Fatality Ratio, CFR) observed in Italy, as compared with other countries, is likely biased by a strong underestimation of infected cases. To give a more realistic estimate of the mortality of Covid-19, we use the most recent estimates of the IFR (Infection Fatality Ratio) of epidemic, based on the minimum observed CFR, and furthermore analyse data obtained from the ship Diamond Princess, a good representation of a  laboratory case-study from an isolated system in which all the people have been tested. From such analyses we derive more realistic estimates of the real extension of the infection, as well as more accurate indicators of how fast the infection propagates. We then point out from the various explanations proposed, the dominant factors causing such an abnormal seriousness of the disease in Italy. Finally, we use the deceased data, the only ones estimated to be reliable enough, to predict the total number of infected people and the interval of time when the infection in Italy could stop.","De Natale, G.; Ricciardi, V.; De Luca, G.; De Natale, D.; Di Meglio, G.; Ferragamo, A.; Marchitelli, V.; Piccolo, A.; Scala, A.; Somma, R.; Spina, E.; Troise, C.",2020-04-10,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.28.20046243,2,Giuseppe De Natale,"Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Naples, Italy & CNR-INO, Pozzuoli (NA), Italy",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046243v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046243v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3390/jcm9051564
21962,The systemic inflammatory response and clinicopathological characteristics in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection: Comparison of 2 consecutive cohorts,"BackgroundIn order to manage the COVID-19 systemic inflammatory response, it is important to identify clinicopathological characteristics across multiple cohorts.

MethodsElectronic patient records for 2 consecutive cohorts of patients admitted to two urban teaching hospitals with COVID-19 during two 7-week periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in Glasgow, U.K. (cohort 1: 17th March 2020 - 1st May 2020) and (cohort 2: 18th May 2020 - 6th July 2020) were examined for routine clinical, laboratory and clinical outcome data.

ResultsCompared with cohort 1, cohort 2 were older (p<0.001), more likely to be female (p<0.05) and have less independent living circumstances (p<0.001). More patients in cohort 2 were PCR positive, CXR negative (both p<0.001) and had low serum albumin concentrations (p<0.001). 30-day mortality was similar between both cohorts (23% and 22%). Over the 2 cohorts, age [&ge;]70 (p<0.001), male gender (p<0.05), hypertension (p<0.01), heart failure (p<0.05), cognitive impairment (p<0.001), frailty (p<0.001), COPD (p<0.05), delirium (p<0.001), elevated perioperative Glasgow Prognostic Score (p[&le;]0.001), elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (p<0.001), low haematocrit (p<0.01), elevated urea (p<0.001), creatinine (p<0.001), glucose (p<0.05) and lactate (p<0.01); and the 4C score were associated with 30-day mortality. When compared with the 4C score, greater frailty (OR 10.2, 95% C.I. 3.4 - 30.6, p<0.01) and low albumin (OR 5.6, 95% C.I. 2.0 - 15.6, p<0.01) were strongly independently associated with 30-day mortality.

ConclusionIn addition to the 4C mortality score, frailty score and a low albumin were strongly independently associated with 30-day mortality in two consecutive cohorts of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

Article summaryO_LIIn two consecutive cohorts of patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to two urban teaching hospitals in Glasgow, UK, there were variations in a number of clinicopathological characteristics despite similar mortality (23 and 22%).
C_LIO_LIIn these two cohorts, in a multivariate analysis that included the 4C mortality score, clinical frailty score >3, low serum albumin concentration (<35 g/L), high neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ([&ge;]5), and abnormal serum sodium concentration (<133/>145 mmol/L) remained independently associated with 30-day mortality.

1669,Tracking the spread of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) based on big data,"The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) appeared in Wuhan in late 2019 have infected 34,598 people, and killed 723 among them until 8th February 2020. The new virus has spread to at least 316 cities (until 1st February 2020) in China. We used the traffic flow data from Baidu Map, and number of air passengers who left Wuhan from 1st January to 26th January, to quantify the potential infectious people. We developed multiple linear models with local population and air passengers as predicted variables to explain the variance of confirmed cases in every city across China. We found the contribution of air passengers from Wuhan was decreasing gradually, but the effect of local population was increasing, indicating the trend of local transmission. However, the increase of local transmission is slow during the early stage of novel coronavirus, due to the super strict control measures carried out by government agents and communities.","Zhao, X.; Liu, X.; Li, X.",2020-02-11,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.02.07.20021196,1,Xinhai Li,"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021196v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021196v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
6322,"Who maintains a good mental health in a locked-down country? A French nationwide online survey of 11,391 participants","BackgroundLockdown measures induce massive societal perturbations and can differentially affect mental wellbeing in populations depending on individual determinants. We aim at investigating the sociodemographic and environmental determinants of wellbeing during global lockdown due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

MethodsA nationwide survey was sent online to the French population during the second week of global lockdown during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, between March 25, 2020 and March 30, 2020. Volunteers were recruited on social networks, online newspapers, and mailing lists. We analyzed sociodemographic and environmental variables obtained from a co-built and evidence-based questionnaire. Mental wellbeing was measured by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS).

ResultsWe analyzed data from 11,391 (56.6%) out of 20,235 participants who answered the questionnaire. After weighting data on age and gender distributions, 5415 of the respondents were male (47.5%), 5932 were female (52.1%), and 52 (0.5%) registered as """"other."""" Multivariate analyses indicated that various factors impacted mental wellbeing. Being female (p < .001), a student (p < .001), disabled (p = .001), or having no access to outdoor space (p = 0.02) was associated with lower WEMWBS scores. Conversely, being employed (p < .001) and having more social contacts (p < .01) were both associated with greater mental wellbeing.

InterpretationWe revealed differences in mental wellbeing among the French population at the early stages of global lockdown. Authorities should consider the particular vulnerability of students, persons with disabilities, and those living in constrained housing conditions that could increase the negative impact of lockdown on mental health.","Haesebaert, F.; Haesebaert, J.; Zante, E.; Franck, N.",2020-05-08,Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology,10.1101/2020.05.03.20089755,1,Frederic Haesebaert,CH le Vinatier,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089755v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089755v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.healthplace.2020.102440
22886,Household COVID-19 risk and in-person schooling,"In-person schooling has proved contentious and difficult to study throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from a massive online survey in the United States indicates an increased risk of COVID-19-related outcomes among respondents living with a child attending school in-person. School-based mitigation measures are associated with significant reductions in risk, particularly daily symptoms screens, teacher masking, and closure of extra-curricular activities. With seven or more mitigation measures, the association between in-person schooling and COVID-19-related outcomes all but disappears. Teachers working outside the home were more likely to report COVID-19-related outcomes, but this association is similar to other occupations (e.g., healthcare, office work). In-person schooling is associated with household COVID-19 risk, but this risk can likely be controlled with properly implemented school-based mitigation measures.

One sentence summaryLiving with children attending in-person school is linked to a higher risk of COVID-19 outcomes, which school-based interventions can mitigate.","Lessler, J.; Grabowski, M.

2212,"Estimation of local novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in Wuhan, China from off-site reported cases and population flow data from different sources","BackgroundsIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia hit Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and spread to the rest of China and overseas. The emergence of this virus coincided with the Spring Festival Travel Rush in China. It is possible to estimate total number of cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, by 23 January 2020, given the cases reported in other cities and population flow data between cities.

MethodsWe built a model to estimate the total number of cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on the number of cases detected outside Wuhan city in China, with the assumption that if the same screening effort used in other cities applied in Wuhan. We employed population flow data from different sources between Wuhan and other cities/regions by 23 January 2020. The number of total cases was determined by the maximum log likelihood estimation.

FindingsFrom overall cities/regions data, we predicted 1326 (95% CI: 1177, 1484), 1151 (95% CI: 1018, 1292) and 5277 (95% CI: 4732, 5859) as total cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on different source of data from Changjiang Daily newspaper, Tencent, and Baidu. From separate cities/regions data, we estimated 1059 (95% CI: 918, 1209), 5214 (95% CI: 4659, 5808) as total cases in Wuhan in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on different sources of population flow data from Tencent and Baidu.

21547,Operational response simulation tool for epidemics within refugee and IDP settlements,"The spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 presents many challenges to healthcare systems and infrastructures across the world, exacerbating inequalities and leaving the worlds most vulnerable populations most affected. Given their density and available infrastructure, refugee and internally displaced person (IDP) settlements can be particularly susceptible to disease spread. Non-pharmaceutical public health interventions can be used to mitigate transmission, and modeling efforts can provide crucial insights on the potential effectiveness of such interventions to help inform decision making processes. In this paper we present an agent-based modeling approach to simulating the spread of disease in refugee and IDP settlements. The model, based on the JUNE open-source framework, is informed by data on geography, demographics, comorbidities, physical infrastructure and other parameters obtained from real-world observations and previous literature. Furthermore, we present a visual analytics tool which allows decision makers to distill insights by comparing the results of different simulations and scenarios. Through simulating their effects on the epidemiological development of COVID-19, we evaluate several public health interventions ranging from increasing mask wearing compliance to the reopening of learning institutions. The development and testing of this approach focuses on the Coxs Bazar refugee settlement in Bangladesh, although our model is designed to be generalizable to other informal settings.","Bullock, J.; Cuesta-Lazaro, C.; Quera-Bofarull, A.; Katta, A.; Hoffmann Pham, K.; Hoover, B.; Strobelt, H.; Moreno Jimenez, R.; Sedgewick, A.; Samir Evers, E.; Kennedy, D.; Harlass, S.; Gidraf Kahindo Maina, A.; Hussien, A.; Luengo-Oroz, M.",2021-01-29,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.01.27.21250611,1,Joseph Bullock,United Nations Global Pulse and Durham University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.27.21250611v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.27.21250611v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

Interviews with FDWs (n = 15) and key informants (n = 3) were conducted between May and August 2020. FDWs reported a dual-country experience of the pandemic, where they expressed concerns about local transmission risks as well as worries about their family members in their home country. Changes to their current work situation included how their employers treated them, as well as their employment status. FDWs also cited blind spots in the Hong Kong policy response that also affected their experience of the pandemic, including a lack of support from the Hong Kong government.

3284,Mitigation and herd immunity strategy for COVID-19 is likely to fail,"On the basis of a semi-realistic SIR microsimulation for Germany and Poland, we show that the R0 parameter interval for which the COVID-19 epidemic stays overcritical but below the capacity limit of the health care system to reach herd immunity is so narrow that a successful implementation of this strategy is likely to fail, which is in contrast to results obtained from classical differential equation models. Our microsimulation is based on official census data and involves household composition and age distribution as the main population structure variables. Outside household contacts are characterised by an out-reproduction number R* which is the only free parameter of the model. For a subcritical domain we compute the time till extinction and prevalence as a function of the initial number of infected individuals and R*.

5207,Prediction of the COVID-19 Epidemic Trends Based on SEIR and AI Models,"The outbreak of novel coronavirus-caused pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wuhan has attracted worldwide attention. To contain its spread, China adopted unprecedented nationwide interventions on January 23. We sought to show how these control measures impacted the containment of the epidemic. We proposed an SEIR(Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) model to analyze the epidemic trend in Wuhan and use the AI model to analyze the epidemic trend in non-Wuhan areas. We found that if the closure was lifted, the outbreak in non-Wuhan areas of mainland China would double in size. Our SEIR and AI model was effective in predicting the COVID-19 epidemic peaks and sizes.

20633,Engineered RNA biosensors enable ultrasensitive SARS-CoV-2 detection in a simple color and luminescence assay,"The continued resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic with multiple variants underlines the need for diagnostic strategies, that are easily adapatable to the changing virus. Here, we have designed and developed toehold RNA-based sensors across the SARS-CoV-2 genome for direct and ultrasensitive detection of the virus and its prominent variants. In our assay, isothermal amplification of a fragment of SARS-CoV-2 RNA coupled with activation of our biosensors leads to a conformational switch in the sensor. This leads to translation of a reporter-protein e.g. LacZ or Nano-lantern that is easily detected using color/luminescence. By optimizing RNA-amplification and biosensor-design, we have generated a highly-sensitive diagnostic assay; with sensitivity down to attomolar SARS-CoV-2 RNA. As low as 100 copies of viral RNA are detected with development of bright color that is easily visualized by the human eye, or a simple cell phone camera as well as quantified using a spectrophotometer. This makes our assay deployable all the way from a well equiped laboratory to a low-resource setting anywhere in the world. Finally, this PHAsed NASBA-Translation Optical Method (PHANTOM) using our engineered RNA biosensors efficiently detects the presence of viral RNA in human patient samples, correlating well with Ct values from RT-qPCR tests. This work presents a powerful and universally accessible strategy for detecting Covid-19 and its prominent variants. This strategy is easily adaptable to further viral evolution and brings RNA-based bioengineering to centerstage.","Chakravarthy, A.; N, A.

12464,The German Corona Consensus Dataset (GECCO): A standardized dataset for COVID-19 research,"BackgroundThe current COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge of research activity. While this research provides important insights, the multitude of studies results in an increasing segmentation of information. To ensure comparability across projects and institutions, standard datasets are needed. Here, we introduce the """"German Corona Consensus Dataset"""" (GECCO), a uniform dataset that uses international terminologies and health IT standards to improve interoperability of COVID-19 data.

MethodsBased on previous work (e.g., the ISARIC-WHO COVID-19 case report form) and in coordination with experts from university hospitals, professional associations and research initiatives, data elements relevant for COVID-19 research were collected, prioritized and consolidated into a compact core dataset. The dataset was mapped to international terminologies, and the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was used to define interoperable, machine-readable data formats.

ResultsA core dataset consisting of 81 data elements with 281 response options was defined, including information about, for example, demography, anamnesis, symptoms, therapy, medications or laboratory values of COVID-19 patients. Data elements and response options were mapped to SNOMED CT, LOINC, UCUM, ICD-10-GM and ATC, and FHIR profiles for interoperable data exchange were defined.

ConclusionGECCO provides a compact, interoperable dataset that can help to make COVID-19 research data more comparable across studies and institutions. The dataset will be further refined in the future by adding domain-specific extension modules for more specialized use cases.","Sass, J.; Bartschke, A.; Lehne, M.; Essenwanger, A.; Rinaldi, E.; Rudolph, S.; Heitmann, K.

16193,"Renin Angiotensin System Inhibition and Susceptibility and Outcomes from COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of 69,200 COVID-19 Patients","BackgroundEarly observational studies suggested that the use of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, specifically angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, may increase the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and adversely affect the prognosis or survival of infected patients. To explore the impact of RAS inhibitor use on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, from all published studies.

Methods and FindingsA systematic review and meta-analysis of the use of RAS inhibitors in relation to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and/or the severity and mortality associated with COVID-19 was conducted. English language bibliographic databases PubMed, Web of Science, OVID Embase, Scopus, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, searched from Jan 1st, 2020 to July 20th, 2020. 58 observational studies (69,200 COVID-19 patients and 3,103,335 controls) were included. There was no difference in the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection between RAS inhibitor users and non-users (unadjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.21), (adjusted OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.02), (adjusted HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.31). There was no significant difference in the severe Covid-19 case rate between RAS inhibitor users and non-users (unadjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.36), (adjusted OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.12), or in mortality due to COVID-19 between RAS inhibitor users and non-users (unadjusted OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.44), (adjusted OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23), (adjusted HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.14).

ConclusionsIn the most comprehensive analysis of all available data to date, treatment with RAS inhibitors was not associated with increased risk of infection, severity of disease, or mortality due to COVID-19. The best available evidence suggests that these treatments should not be discontinued on the basis of concern about risk associated with COVID-19.","Zhang, Y.; Yu, S.; Xu, Y.; Williams, B.",2020-12-03,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.03.20206375,2,Bryan Williams,University College London,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.03.20206375v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.03.20206375v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

Multiple epicenters of the pandemic have emerged since the first pneumonia cases in Wuhan, first in Italy followed by the USA and Brazil. Up to now, Brazil is the second most affected country, however, genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in the country are restricted to some highly impacted states. Although the Pernambuco state, located in the Northeast Region, is the sixth most affected brazilian state and the second considering lethality rate, there is a lack of high quality genomic sequences from the strains circulating in this region. Here, we sequenced 38 strains of SARS-CoV-2 from patients presenting Covid-19 symptoms. Phylogenetic reconstructions revealed that three lineages were circulating in the state and 36 samples belong to B1.1 lineage. We detected two introductions from European countries and five clades, corroborating the community spread of the virus between different municipalities of the state. Finally, we detected that all except one strain showed the D614G spike protein amino acid change that may impact virus infectivity in human cells. Our study brought new light to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 strains in one of the most heavily impacted states of Brazil.","Paiva, M. H. S.; Guedes, D. R. D.; Docena, C.; Bezerra, M. F.; Dezordi, F.

8032,Modelling COVID-19 Transmission in the United States through Interstate and Foreign Travels and Evaluating Impact of Governmental Public Health Interventions,"BackgroundThe first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as pandemic by WHO. Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial for epidemic prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

MethodsA disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model is developed to study transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of non-linear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R0 was computed. Stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted.

ResultsAnalysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increases while placing interstates individuals and foreigners under quarantine, decreases the chances of exposure and subsequent infection, leading to an increase in the recovery rate.

ConclusionInterstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, help in effectively controlling the epidemic.","Shah, N. H.; Sheoran, N.; Jayswal, E.

11054,Objective sensory testing methods reveal a higher prevalence of olfactory loss in COVID-19 positive patients compared to subjective methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has currently infected over 6.5 million people worldwide. In response to the pandemic, numerous studies have tried to identify causes and symptoms of the disease. Emerging evidence supports recently acquired anosmia (complete loss of smell) and hyposmia (partial loss of smell) as symptoms of COVID-19, but studies of olfactory dysfunction show a wide range of prevalence, from 5% to 98%. We undertook a search of Pubmed/Medline and Google Scholar with the keywords """"COVID-19,"""" """"smell,"""" and/or """"olfaction."""" We included any study that quantified olfactory loss as a symptom of COVID-19. Studies were grouped and compared based on the type of method used to measure smell loss--subjective measures such as self-reported smell loss versus objective measures using rated stimuli--to determine if prevalence rate differed by method type. For each study, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from point estimates of olfactory disturbance rates. We identified 34 articles quantifying anosmia as a symptom of COVID-19, collected from cases identified from January 16 to April 30, 2020. The pooled prevalence estimate of smell loss was 77% when assessed through objective measurements (95% CI of 61.4-89.2%) and 45% with subjective measurements (95% CI of 31.1-58.5%). Objective measures are a more sensitive method to identify smell loss as a result of infection with SARS-CoV-2; the use of subjective measures, while expedient during the early stages of the pandemic, underestimates the true prevalence of smell loss.","Hannum, M.

8333,The interactive effects of ambient air pollutants-meteorological factors on confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 120 Chinese cities,"Emerging evidences have confirmed effects of meteorological factors on novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, few studies verify the impact of air pollutants on this pandemic. This study aims to explore the association of ambient air pollutants, meteorological factors and their interactions effect confirmed case counts of COVID-19 in 120 Chinese cities. Here, we collected total confirmed cases of COVID-19 by combining with meteorological factors and air pollutants data from 15th January 2020 to 18th March 2020 in 120 Chinese cities. Spearman correlation analysis was employed to estimate the association between two variables; univariate and multivariate negative binomial regression analysis were applied to explore the effect of air pollutants and meteorological parameters on the COVID-19 confirmed cases. Positive associations were found between the confirmed cases of COVID-19 and carbon monoxide (CO), aerodynamic particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter [&le;]2.5 m (PM2.5), relative humidity (RH) and air pressure (AP). And negative association was found for sulfur dioxide (SO2). In addition, multivariate negative binomial regression analysis suggested that confirmed cases of COVID-19 was positively correlated with ozone (O3) in lag 0 day while it was negatively associated with wind velocity (WV) in lag 14 days, and the pollutants-meteorological factors interactions also associate with COVID-19. In conclusions, air pollutants and meteorological factors and their interactions all associate with COVID-19.","Zhou, J.; Qin, L.; Liu, N.; Meng, X.",2020-10-23,Occupational And Environmental Health,10.1101/2020.05.27.20111542,2,Nan Liu,"Department of Occupational Health and Occupational Medicine, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public Health, Southern",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.20111542v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.20111542v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
6903,Defining the Pandemic at the State Level: Sequence-Based Epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the Arizona COVID-19 Genomics Union (ACGU),"In December of 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in the city of Wuhan, China causing severe morbidity and mortality. Since then, the virus has swept across the globe causing millions of confirmed infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths. To better understand the nature of the pandemic and the introduction and spread of the virus in Arizona, we sequenced viral genomes from clinical samples tested at the TGen North Clinical Laboratory, provided to us by the Arizona Department of Health Services, and at Arizona State University and the University of Arizona, collected as part of community surveillance projects. Phylogenetic analysis of 79 genomes we generated from across Arizona revealed a minimum of 9 distinct introductions throughout February and March. We show that >80% of our sequences descend from clades that were initially circulating widely in Europe but have since dominated the outbreak in the United States. In addition, we show that the first reported case of community transmission in Arizona descended from the Washington state outbreak that was discovered in late February. Notably, none of the observed transmission clusters are epidemiologically linked to the original travel-related cases in the state, suggesting successful early isolation and quarantine. Finally, we use molecular clock analyses to demonstrate a lack of identifiable, widespread cryptic transmission in Arizona prior to the middle of February 2020.","Ladner, J. T.; Larsen, B.

4826,Effectiveness of Intravenous Immunoglobulin for Children with Severe COVID-19: A Rapid Review,"BackgroundIntravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is usually used as supportive therapy, but the treatment of COVID-19 by IVIG is controversial. This rapid review aims to explore the clinical effectiveness and safety of IVIG in the treatment of children with severe COVID-19.

MethodsWe systematically searched the literature on the use of IVIG in patients with COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), including both adults and children. We assessed the risk of bias and quality of evidence and reported the main findings descriptively.

ResultsA total of 1519 articles were identified by initial literature search, and finally six studies, included one randomized controlled trial (RCT), four case series and one case report involving 198 patients. One case series showed the survival of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was not improved by IVIG. One case report showed high-dose IVIG could improve the outcome of COVID-19 adults. Three observational studies showed inconsistent results of the effect of IVIG on SARS patients. One RCT showed that IVIG did not reduce mortality or the incidence of nosocomial infection in adults with severe SARS. The quality of evidence was between low and very low.

ConclusionsThe existing evidence is insufficient to support the efficacy or safety of IVIG in the treatment of COVID-19.","Zhang, J.; Yang, Y.; Yang, N.; Ma, Y.; Zhou, Q.; Li, W.; Wang, X.; Huang, L.; Luo, X.; Fukuoka, T.; Ahn, H.

15335,COVID-19 pediatric mortality rates are heterogenous between countries,"Introduction: Severe COVID-19 is infrequent in children, with a lethality rate of about 0.08%. This study aims to explore differences in the pediatric mortality rate between countries. Methods: Countries with populations over 5 million that report COVID-19 deaths disaggregated data by quinquennial or decennial age groups were analyzed. Data were extracted from COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Age Database, national ministries of health, and the World Health Organization. Results: 23 countries were included in the analysis. Pediatric mortality varied from 0 to 12.1 deaths per million people of the corresponding age group, with the highest rate in Peru. In most countries, deaths were more frequent in the 0-4 years old age group, except for Brazil. The pediatric/ general COVID-19 mortality showed a great variation between countries and ranged from 0 (Republic of Korea) to 10.4% (India). Pediatric and Pediatric/general COVID mortality have a strong correlation with 2018 neonatal mortality (r=0.77, p<0.001 and r= 0.88, p<0.001 respectively), while it has a moderate or absent (r=0.47, p=0.02 and r=0.19, p=0.38, respectively) correlation with COVID-19 mortality in the general population. Conclusions: There is an important heterogenicity in pediatric COVI-19 mortality between countries that parallels historical neonatal mortality. Neonatal mortality is a known index of the quality of a country s Health System which points to the importance of social determinants of health in pediatric COVID-19 mortality disparities, an issue which should be further explored.","Gonzalez-Garcia, N.; Miranda-Lora, A.

20435,Spatial-temporal relationship between population mobility and COVID-19 outbreaks in South Carolina: A time series forecasting analysis,"BackgroundPopulation mobility is closely associated with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) transmission, and it could be used as a proximal indicator to predict future outbreaks, which could inform proactive non-pharmaceutical interventions for disease control. South Carolina (SC) is one of the states which reopened early and then suffered from a sharp increase of COVID-19.

ObjectiveTo examine the spatial-temporal relationship between population mobility and COVID-19 outbreaks and use population mobility to predict daily new cases at both state- and county- levels in SC.

MethodsThis longitudinal study used disease surveillance data and Twitter-based population mobility data from March 6 to November 11, 2020 in SC and its top five counties with the largest number of cumulative confirmed cases. Daily new case was calculated by subtracting the cumulative confirmed cases of previous day from the total cases. Population mobility was assessed using the number of users with travel distance larger than 0.5 mile which was calculated based on their geotagged twitters. Poisson count time series model was employed to carry out the research goals.

ResultsPopulation mobility was positively associated with state-level daily COVID-19 incidence and those of the top five counties (i.e., Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, Richland). At the state-level, final model with time window within the last 7-day had the smallest prediction error, and the prediction accuracy was as high as 98.7%, 90.9%, and 81.6% for the next 3-, 7-, 14- days, respectively. Among Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, and Richland counties, the best predictive models were established based on their observations in the last 9-, 14-, 28-, 20-, and 9- days, respectively. The 14-day prediction accuracy ranged from 60.3% to 74.5%.

ConclusionsPopulation mobility was positively associated with COVID-19 incidences at both state- and county- levels in SC. Using Twitter-based mobility data could provide acceptable prediction for COVID-19 daily new cases. Population mobility measured via social media platform could inform proactive measures and resource relocations to curb disease outbreaks and their negative influences.","Zeng, C.; Zhang, J.; Li, Z.; Sun, X.; Olatosi, B.; Weissman, S.; Li, X.",2021-01-08,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.01.02.21249119,2,Chengbo Zeng,University of South Carolina,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.02.21249119v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.02.21249119v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
5921,"Commercial stocks of SARS-CoV-2 RNA may report low concentration values, leading to artificially increased apparent sensitivity of diagnostic assays","In response to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has rapidly issued 49 emergency use authorizations (EUAs) for SARS-CoV-2 in vitro diagnostic test-kits. A critical metric in the performance evaluation for a diagnostic test kit is the analytical sensitivity, which is measured by the limit of detection (LOD). Commercial RNA stocks with known titers are used to determine LOD. We identified a problem with the titer reported for the commercial stocks when examining the analytical sensitivity of the reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) protocol that is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) using plasmid DNA from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), synthetic RNA from BEI Resources (BEI), and extracted genomic RNA from BEI. We detected 3/3 positives for reactions containing synthetic RNA at a concentration of 0.1 copies/reaction (based on the suppliers label concentration). The apparent better-than-single-molecule performance is a statistically highly unlikely event, indicating a potential inaccuracy in the suppliers quantification of the stock material. Using an ultrasensitive and precise assay, reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR), we independently quantified concentrations of commercial SARS-CoV-2 plasmid DNA and SARS-CoV-2 RNA stocks. For plasmid DNA, the actual concentration measured by RT-dPCR was 11% of the nominal label concentration. For synthetic RNA, the actual concentration measured by RT-dPCR for one lot was 770% of the label concentration and for a different lot was 57% of the label concentration. For genomic RNA, the concentration measured by RT-dPCR for one lot was 240% of the label concentration and for a different lot it was 300% of the label concentration. This SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA from BEI Resources has been used in at least 11 approved FDA Emergency Use Authorizations as of April 27, 2020. Such deviations of reported RNA or DNA stock concentrations from true concentrations can result in inaccurate quantification and calculation of LOD. Precise and accurate reporting of DNA and RNA stock concentrations by commercial suppliers will enable accurate quantification of assay performance, which is urgently needed to improve evaluation of different assays by diagnostic developers and regulatory bodies.","Jue, E.; Ismagilov, R.

22096,Robust immune responses after one dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine dose in SARS-CoV-2 experienced individuals,"The use of COVID-19 vaccines will play a major role in helping to end the pandemic that has killed millions worldwide. COVID-19 vaccine candidates have resulted in robust humoral responses and protective efficacy in human trials, but efficacy trials excluded individuals with prior diagnosis of COVID-19. As a result, little is known about how immune responses induced by mRNA vaccine candidates differ in individuals who recovered from COVID-19. Here, we evaluated longitudinal immune responses to two-dose BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination in 13 adults who recovered from COVID-19, compared to 19 adults who did not have prior COVID-19 diagnosis. Consistent with prior studies of mRNA vaccines, we observed robust cytotoxic CD8 T cell responses in both cohorts. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals had progressive increases in humoral and antigen-specific antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses following each dose of vaccine, whereas SARS-CoV-2-experienced individuals demonstrated strong humoral and antigen-specific ASC responses to the first dose but muted responses to the second dose of the vaccine for the time points studied. Together, these data highlight the relevance of immunological history for understanding vaccine immune responses and may have significant implications for personalizing mRNA vaccination regimens used to prevent COVID-19.

There are few published methods which enable mask designers, makers and purchasers to assess the relative filtration ability of mask making materials. Those methods which do exist are prohibitively expensive and difficult to conduct. As a result, mask makers, non-profits, and small-scale designers face difficult decisions when designing face coverings for personal and commercial use.

2439,Clinical Characteristics of Two Human to Human Transmitted Coronaviruses: Corona Virus Disease 2019 versus Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.,"After the outbreak of the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) worldwide in 2012. Currently, a novel human coronavirus has caused a major disease outbreak, and named corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The emergency of MRES-COV and COVID-19 has caused global panic and threatened health security. Unfortunately, the similarities and differences between the two coronavirus diseases remain to be unknown. The aim of this study, therefore, is to perform a systematic review to compare epidemiological, clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19 and MERS-COV population. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials database to identify potential studies reported COVID-19 or MERS-COV. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory outcomes, the admission rate of intensive cure unit (ICU), discharge rate and fatality rate were evaluated using GraphPad Prism software. Thirty-two studies involving 3770 patients (COVID-19 = 1062, MERS-COV = 2708) were included in this study. The present study revealed that compared with COVID-19 population, MERS-COV population had a higher rate of ICU admission, discharge and fatality and longer incubation time. It pointed out that fever, cough and generalised weakness and myalgia were main clinical manifestations of both COVID-19 and MERS-COV, whereas ARDS was main complication.

10662,Cancer inpatient with COVID-19: a report from the Brazilian National Cancer Institute,"Brazil has been recording a frightening exponential curve of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cancer patients with COVID-19 are likely to have a greater risk of complications and death. A retrospective search in the electronic medical records of cancer inpatients admitted to the Brazilian National Cancer Institute from April 30, 2020 to May 26, 2020 granted identification of 181 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR method. The mean age was 55.3 years (SD {+/-}21.1). The most prevalent solid tumors were breast (40 [22.1%]), gastrointestinal (24 [13.3%]), and gynecological (22 [12.2%]). Among hematological malignancies, lymphoma (20 [11%]) and leukemia (10 [5.5%]) predominated. The most common complications were respiratory failure (70 [38.7%]), septic shock (40 [22.1%]) and acute kidney injury (33 [18.2%]). A total of 60 (33.1%) patients died due to COVID-19 complications. By multivariate analysis, cases with admission due to symptoms of COVID-19 (p = 0.027) and with two or more metastatic sites (p <0.001) showed a higher risk of COVID-19-specific death. This is the first study in a cohort of Brazilian cancer patients with COVID-19. The rates of complications and COVID-19-specific death were significantly high. Our data prompts urgent and effective public policies for this group of especially vulnerable patients.

24621,The association of ABO blood group with the asymptomatic COVID-19 cases in India,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted several waves of infection in many countries worldwide. The large variations in case fatality ratio among different geographical regions suggests that the human susceptibility against this virus varies substantially. Several studies from different parts of the world showed a significant association of ABO blood group and COVID-19 susceptibility. It was shown that individuals with blood group O are at the lower risk of coronavirus infection. To establish the association of ABO blood group in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, we for the first time analysed SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies as well as blood groups among 509 random individuals from three major districts of Eastern Uttar Pradesh region of India.. Interestingly, we found neutralising antibodies in significantly higher percentage of people with blood group AB (0.36) followed by B (0.31), A (0.22) and lowest in people with blood group O (0.11). This indicates that people with blood group AB are at comparatively higher risk of infection than other blood groups. Further, in line to previous reports we too observed that people with blood group O have significantly decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, among the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with blood group AB has highest, whilst blood group O has lowest risk of infection.","Singh, P. P.; Srivastava, A. K.; Upadhyay, S.

Here we describe clinical performance of T- Detect COVID, the first reported assay to determine recent or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection based on T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing and immune repertoire profiling from whole blood samples.

MethodsMethods for high-throughput immunosequencing of the TCR{beta} gene from blood specimens have been described1. We developed a statistical classifier showing high specificity for identifying prior SARS-CoV-2 infection2, utilizing >4,000 SARS-CoV-2-associated TCR sequences from 784 cases and 2,447 controls across 5 independent cohorts. The T-Detect COVID Assay comprises immunosequencing and classifier application to yield a qualitative positive or negative result. Several retrospective and prospective cohorts were enrolled to assess assay performance including primary and secondary Positive Percent Agreement (PPA; N=205, N=77); primary and secondary Negative Percent Agreement (NPA; N=87, N=79); PPA compared to serology (N=55); and pathogen cross-reactivity (N=38).

ResultsT-Detect COVID demonstrated high PPA in subjects with prior PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (97.1% 15+ days from diagnosis; 94.5% 15+ days from symptom onset), high NPA ([~]100%) in presumed or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 negative cases, equivalent or higher PPA than two commercial EUA serology tests, and no evidence of pathogen cross-reactivity.

ConclusionT-Detect COVID is a novel T-cell immunosequencing assay demonstrating high clinical performance to identify recent or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection from standard blood samples. This assay can provide critical insights on the SARS-CoV-2 immune response, with potential implications for clinical management, risk stratification, surveillance, assessing protective immunity, and understanding long-term sequelae.","Dalai, S.

17264,Outcomes evaluated in controlled clinical trials on the management of COVID-19: A methodological systematic review,"It is crucial that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) evaluate the outcomes that are critical to patients and clinicians, to facilitate relevance, interpretability, and comparability.

This methodological systematic review describes the outcomes evaluated in 415 RCTs on the management of COVID-19, that were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, by 5/5/2020.

Significant heterogeneity was observed in the selection of outcomes and the instruments used to measure them. Mortality, adverse events and treatment success or failure are only evaluated in 64.4%, 48.4% and 43% of the included studies, respectively, while other outcomes are selected less often. Studies focusing on more severe presentations (hospitalized patients or requiring intensive care) most frequently evaluate mortality and adverse events, while hospital admission and viral detection/load are most frequently assessed in the community setting. Outcome measurement instruments are poorly reported and heterogeneous. In general, simple instruments that can control for important sources of bias are favoured. Follow-up does not exceed one month in 64.3% of these earlier trials, and long-term COVID-19 burden is rarely assessed.

The methodological issues identified could delay the introduction of potentially life-saving treatments in clinical practice. Our findings demonstrate the need for consensus in the design of RCTs.

16637,Persistent symptoms after Covid-19: qualitative study of 114 long Covid patients and draft quality criteria for services,"BackgroundApproximately 10% of patients with Covid-19 experience symptoms beyond 3-4 weeks. Patients call this """"long Covid"""". We sought to document the lived experience of such patients, their accounts of accessing and receiving healthcare, and their ideas for improving services.

MethodWe held 55 individual interviews and 8 focus groups (n = 59) with people recruited from UK-based long Covid patient support groups, social media and snowballing. We restricted some focus groups to health professionals since they had already self-organised into online communities. Participants were invited to tell their personal stories and comment on others stories. Data were audiotaped, transcribed, anonymised and coded using NVIVO. Analysis incorporated sociological theories of illness, healing, peer support, the clinical relationship, access to care, and service redesign.

ResultsThe sample was 70% female, aged 27-73 years, and comprised White British (74%), Asian (11%), White Other (7%), Black (4%), and Mixed (4%). 27 were doctors and 23 other health professionals. 10% had been hospitalised. Analysis revealed a confusing illness with many, varied and often relapsing-remitting symptoms and uncertain prognosis; a heavy sense of loss and stigma; difficulty accessing and navigating services; difficulty being taken seriously and achieving a diagnosis; disjointed and siloed care (including inability to access specialist services); variation in standards (e.g. inconsistent criteria for seeing, investigating and referring patients); variable quality of the therapeutic relationship (some participants felt well supported while others felt """"fobbed off""""); and possible critical events (e.g. deterioration after being unable to access services). Emotional touch points in participants experiences informed ideas for improving services.

ConclusionQuality principles for a long Covid service should include ensuring access to care, reducing burden of illness, taking clinical responsibility and providing continuity of care, multi-disciplinary rehabilitation, evidence-based investigation and management, and further development of the knowledge base and clinical services.

The mathematical model assumes Human-Human infection as well as Human-Pathogen interaction. Using the SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) compartmental model with additional component of the pathogen,we simulated the dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak and impact of different control measures. The resulting system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are directly solved using a combination of fourth and fifth-order Runge-Kutta methods. Simulation results indicate that non-pharmaceutical measures such as school closure, social distancing and movement restriction emphatically flatten the epidemic peak curve hence leading to a smaller number of overall disease cases.","Ojiambo, V.

Government officials, policy makers and public health officials have been scrambling and struggling to """"flatten the curve"""" to decelerate the prevalence and spread of COVID-19 given the significant economic destruction of the spread of the virus. Most """"flatten the curve"""" models are based on Compartmental Models. This preliminary research is based on six (6) selected countries significantly impacted by COVID-19 and endeavors to build a new model based on moving averages lagged at different time periods to better hone in on the time the COVID-19 begins to decelerate using the date of first reported case and date of first reported death. This new model, the Consistent Deceleration Model (CDM) is based on each individual countrys date of Peak Increase in Mortality Rate (PINC MR) and the Moving Average since the peak increase in mortality rate (MA POSTINC). The CDM can be utilized of one of many quantitative tools to determine the strength of the deceleration of an infectious outbreak.","Pascarella, J.; Pascarella, E.",2020-07-11,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.09.20150136,1,Joseph Pascarella,Saint Joseph\'s College - New York,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20150136v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20150136v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
8918,Statistical Decision Properties of Imprecise Trials Assessing COVID-19 Drugs,"As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, researchers are reporting findings of randomized trials comparing standard care with care augmented by experimental drugs. The trials have small sample sizes, so estimates of treatment effects are imprecise. Seeing imprecision, clinicians reading research articles may find it difficult to decide when to treat patients with experimental drugs. Whatever decision criterion one uses, there is always some probability that random variation in trial outcomes will lead to prescribing sub-optimal treatments. A conventional practice when comparing standard care and an innovation is to choose the innovation only if the estimated treatment effect is positive and statistically significant. This practice defers to standard care as the status quo. To evaluate decision criteria, we use the concept of near optimality, which jointly considers the probability and magnitude of decision errors. An appealing decision criterion from this perspective is the empirical success rule, which chooses the treatment with the highest observed average patient outcome in the trial. Considering the design of recent and ongoing COVID-19 trials, we show that the empirical success rule yields treatment results that are much closer to optimal than those generated by prevailing decision criteria based on hypothesis tests.

While essential activities remained consistent over time, more individuals attended gatherings of 10 or more people as cases rose, particularly in the 18-29 age group. A majority of individuals wore masks. It appears necessary to continue limiting gatherings and encourage mask-wearing, particularly among younger groups.","Sheehan, M. M.; Pfoh, E.

15271,Integrative Genomics Analysis Reveals a Novel 21q22.11 Locus Contributing to Susceptibility of COVID-19,"The systematic identification of host genetic risk factors is essential for the understanding and treatment of COVID-19. By performing a meta-analysis of two independent genome-wide association (GWAS) summary datasets (N = 680,128), a novel locus at 21q22.11 was identified to be associated with COVID-19 infection (rs9976829 in IFNAR2 and upstream of IL10RB, OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.09 - 1.23, P = 2.57x10-6). The rs9976829 represents a strong splicing quantitative trait locus (sQTL) for both IFNAR2 and IL10RB genes, especially in lung tissue (P 1.8x10-24). Gene-based association analysis also found IFNAR2 was significantly associated with COVID-19 infection (P = 2.58x10-7). Integrative genomics analysis of combining GWAS with eQTL data showed the expression variations of IFNAR2 and IL10RB have prominent effects on COVID-19 in various types of tissues, especially in lung tissue. The majority of IFNAR2-expressing cells were dendritic cells (40%) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (38.5%), and IL10RB-expressing cells were mainly nonclassical monocytes (29.6%). IFNAR2 and IL10RB are targeted by several interferons-related drugs. Together, our results uncover 21q22.11 as a novel susceptibility locus for COVID-19, in which individuals with G alleles of rs9976829 have a higher probability of COVID-19 susceptibility than those with non-G alleles.","Ma, Y.; Huang, Y.; Zhao, S.; Yao, Y.; Zhang, Y.; Qu, J.; Wu, N.; Su, J.",2020-09-18,Genetic And Genomic Medicine,10.1101/2020.09.16.20195685,1,Jianzhong Su,"Institute of Biomedical Big Data, School of Biomedical Engineering, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 32",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.16.20195685v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.16.20195685v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
13943,The analysis of the long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the cellular immune system in individuals recovering from COVID-19 reveals a profound NKT cell impairment,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) affects millions of people and killed hundred-thousands of individuals. While acute and intermediate interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system have been studied extensively, long-term impacts on the cellular immune system remained to be analyzed. Here, we comprehensively characterized immunological changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 49 COVID-19 convalescent individuals (CI) in comparison to 27 matched SARS-CoV-2 unexposed individuals (UI). Despite recovery from the disease for more than 2 months, CI showed significant decreases in frequencies of invariant NKT and NKT-like cells compared to UI. Concomitant with the decrease in NKT-like cells, an increase in the percentage of Annexin V and 7-AAD double positive NKT-like cells was detected, suggesting that the reduction in NKT-like cells results from cell death months after recovery. Significant increases in regulatory T cell frequencies, TIM-3 expression on CD4 and CD8 T cells, as well as PD-L1 expression on B cells were also observed in CI, while the cytotoxic potential of T cells and NKT-like cells, defined by GzmB expression, was significantly diminished. However, both CD4 and CD8 T cells of CI showed increased Ki67 expression and were fully capable to proliferate and produce effector cytokines upon TCR stimulation. Collectively, we provide the first comprehensive characterization of immune signatures in patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that the cellular immune system of COVID-19 patients is still under a sustained influence even months after the recovery from disease.","Liu, J.; Yang, X.; Wang, H.; Li, Z.; Deng, H.; Jing, L.; Xiong, S.; He, J.; Guo, C.; Wang, W.; Zelinskyy, G.; Trilling, M.; Dittmer, U.; Lu, M.; Sutter, K.; Senff, T.; Menne, C.; Timm, J.; Zhang, Y.; Deng, F.; Feng, X.; Lu, Y.; Wu, J.; Yang, D.; Wang, B.; Zheng, X.",2020-08-25,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.21.20179358,1,Baoju Wang,"Union hospital, Tongji Medical College , HUST",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179358v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179358v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
2424,Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Pneumonia 2019 (COVID-19): An Updated Systematic Review,"OBJECTIVEClinical characteristics of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been described in numerous studies but yielded varying results. We aimed to conduct a systematic review on scientific literatures and to synthesize critical data on clinical traits of COVID-19 from its initial outbreak to pandemic.

METHODSSystematic searches were conducted to identify retrospective observational study that contained clinical characteristics on COVID-19 through multiple databases. Two reviewers independently evaluated eligible publications. Data on clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were extracted and analyzed.

RESULTSSeventy-two retrospective studies demonstrating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were included. A total of 3470 COVID-19 patients were synthesized to the final analysis in an unbiased manner. The most common symptom was fever (2878 [83.0%]), and 63.4% of the patients presented fever as onset symptom. There were 2528 [88.2%] of 2866 cases had abnormal lung findings on chest CT scan. Laboratory findings showed that 1498 [62.8%] of 2387 cases had lymphopenia, and 1354 [64.8%] of 2091 cases had an increased level of C-reactive protein (CRP). A total of 185 [11.5%] patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) while the overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 3.7%. Compared to patients admitted outside of Hubei, China, those from Hubei had a significant higher ICU admission rate (21.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001).

MethodsWe established and analyzed a registry of pediatric COVID-19 in Western PA that includes cases in patients <22 years of age cared for by the pediatric quaternary medical center in the area and its associated pediatric primary care network from March 11 through August 20, 2020.

ResultsOur cohort included 424 pediatric COVID-19 cases (mean age 12.5 years, 47.4% female); 65% reported exposure and 79% presented with symptoms. The most common initial healthcare contact was through telehealth (45%). Most cases were followed as outpatients, but twenty-two patients (4.5%) were hospitalized: 19 with acute COVID-19 disease, and three for multisystem inflammatory syndrome of children (MIS-C). Admitted patients were younger (p<0.001) and more likely to have pre-existing conditions (p<0.001). Black/Hispanic patients were 5.8 times more likely to be hospitalized than white patients (p=0.012). Five patients (1.2%) were admitted to the PICU, including all three MIS-C cases; two required BiPAP and one mechanical ventilation. All patients survived.

ConclusionsWe provide a comprehensive snapshot of pediatric COVID-19 disease in an area with low to moderate incidence.

7965,Association of Renin Angiotensin System Blockers with Outcomes in Patients with Covid-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"BackgroundPatients with cardiovascular disease are at increased risk of critical illness and mortality from Covid-19 disease. Conflicting findings have raised concerns regarding the association of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) use with likelihood or severity of infection during this pandemic.

ObjectiveTo study the cumulative evidence for association of ACEI/ARB use with outcomes among patients with confirmed Covid-19.

MethodsThe MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were thoroughly searched from November 01, 2019 to May 15, 2020 for studies reporting on outcomes based on ACEI/ARB use in patients with confirmed Covid-19. Preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis guidelines were used for the present study. Relevant data was collected and pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random-effects model.

Main Outcome measuresIn-hospital mortality was the primary end of interest. Second end-point was severe or critical illness defined as either need for intensive care unit, invasive mechanical ventilation, or mortality.

ResultsFifteen studies with total of 23,822 patients (N ACEI/ARB=6,650) were included in the present analysis. Overall, prevalence of ACEI/ARB use ranged from 7.7% to 46.2% across studies. Among 10 studies, patients using ACEI/ARB had similar odds of mortality [OR 1.03 (0.69-1.55)] and severe or critical illness [1.18 (0.91-1.54)] compared to those not on ACEI/ARB. In an analysis restricted to patients with hypertension, ACEI/ARB use was associated with significantly lower mortality [0.64 (0.45-0.89)], while the odds of severe/critical illness [0.76(0.52-1.12); p=0.16] remained non-significant compared with non-ACEI/ARB users.

ConclusionThere is no evidence for increased risk of severe illness or mortality in patients using ACEI/ARB compared with non-users. In patients with hypertension, ACE/ARB use might be associated with reduced mortality, however these findings need to be confirmed in prospective randomized controlled trials.","Garg, A.; Rout, A.; Sharma, A.; Fiorello, B.; Kostis, J.

19709,"Anosmia and other SARS-CoV-2 positive test-associated symptoms, across three national, digital surveillance platforms as the COVID-19 pandemic and response unfolded: an observation study","BackgroundMultiple participatory surveillance platforms were developed across the world in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, providing a real-time understanding of community-wide COVID-19 epidemiology. During this time, testing criteria broadened and healthcare policies matured. We sought to test whether there were consistent associations of symptoms with SARS-CoV-2 test status across three national surveillance platforms, during periods of testing and policy changes, and whether inconsistencies could better inform our understanding and future studies as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses.

MethodsFour months (1st April 2020 to 31st July 2020) of observation through three volunteer COVID-19 digital surveillance platforms targeting communities in three countries (Israel, United Kingdom, and United States). Logistic regression of self-reported symptom on self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test status (or test access), adjusted for age and sex, in each of the study cohorts. Odds ratios over time were compared to known changes in testing policies and fluctuations in COVID-19 incidence.

FindingsAnosmia/ageusia was the strongest, most consistent symptom associated with a positive COVID-19 test, based on 658,325 tests (5% positive) from over 10 million respondents in three digital surveillance platforms using longitudinal and cross-sectional survey methodologies. During higher-incidence periods with broader testing criteria, core COVID-19 symptoms were more strongly associated with test status. Lower incidence periods had, overall, larger confidence intervals.

InterpretationThe strong association of anosmia/ageusia with self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test positivity is omnipresent, supporting its validity as a reliable COVID-19 signal, regardless of the participatory surveillance platform or testing policy. This analysis highlights that precise effect estimates, as well as an understanding of test access patterns to interpret differences, are best done only when incidence is high. These findings strongly support the need for testing access to be as open as possible both for real-time epidemiologic investigation and public health utility.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSAs the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved, testing capacity expanded and governmental guidelines adapted, generally encouraging testing with a broader set of symptoms, not just fever with respiratory symptoms. In parallel, multiple large-scale citizen science digital surveillance platforms launched to complement knowledge from laboratory and somewhat smaller clinical studies. Symptoms such as loss of sense of smell have been identified as strongly predictive of COVID-19 infection in both clinical and syndromic surveillance analyses, and have therefore been used to inform these testing policy changes and access expansion.

Added value of this studyThis study identifies symptoms that are or are not consistently associated with SARS-CoV-2 test positivity over time and across three country-based COVID-19 surveillance platforms in the United States, United Kingdom and Israel. These platforms are website and smartphone based, as well as cross-sectional and longitudinal. The study period of 4 months covers fluctuating COVID-19 prevalence during the fall of the first wave and, in some areas, rise of the second wave. In addition, the study period overlaps expansion of test access and test seeking. Importantly, these analyses track and highlight the value of individual symptoms to predict SARS-CoV-2 test positivity under a range of conditions.

Implications of all the available evidenceDespite differences in surveillance methodology, access to SARS-CoV-2 testing and disease prevalence, loss of sense of smell or taste was consistently the strongest predictor of COVID-19 infection across all platforms over time. As access to testing broadened, the relevance of COVID-like symptoms and consistency of their predictive ability became apparent. However, confidence bounds generally widened with a fall in COVID-19 incidence. Therefore, for the most robust symptom-based COVID-19 prediction models should consider surveillance data during periods of higher incidence and improved test access, and effect estimates that replicate across different epidemiologic conditions and platforms.","Sudre, C.

13689,"Keep calm and carry on: safety, feasibility and early outcomes of head and neck cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic","BackgroundPatients with cancer are considered at higher risk of COVID-19 infection and increased severity of infection. Anti-cancer treatment may further increase those risks.

The aim of this work is to report early outcomes in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) treated during the pandemic.

Materials and MethodsA retrospective cohort study in a UK tertiary level oncology centre between 1st March and 23 June 2020, including patients with HNC who were either newly diagnosed, had developed new recurrent/metastatic disease, or were already scheduled to receive treatment during that period.

Results200 patients were evaluated. Median age was 64 years, 65.5% had multiple co-morbidities, 77.5% were current or ex-smokers and 59.5% lived in areas of deprivation. 99 patients were treated with 6 weeks of radical (chemo) radiotherapy. Systemic anti-cancer treatment was delivered to 40 patients.

2 (1.0%) patients with HNC had confirmed COVID-19 infection; 1 patient prior to primary radical RT - no delay to treatment was required and RT was completed as planned, 1 patient acquired COVID-19 after primary surgery but recovered well and started adjuvant RT 9.7 weeks after surgery.

The proportion of patients receiving supportive care only (19.5%) was in keeping with that pre-COVID-19. The proportion of patients not completing (chemo) radiotherapy (3.4%) or with gaps in treatment (14.1%) was similar to pre-COVID-19. 30-day mortality after radical (chemo)radiotherapy was 2.3%, no higher than in previous years.

ConclusionsIt is feasible and safe to deliver standard treatment for patients with HNC during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Walker, S.; Thomson, M. C.; Campbell, F.; Hay, L.

14743,COVID-19 transmission in a university setting: a rapid review of modelling studies,"Managing COVID-19 within a university setting presents unique challenges. At the start of term, students arrive from geographically diverse locations and potentially have higher numbers of social contacts than the general population, particularly if living in university halls of residence accommodation. Mathematical models are useful tools for understanding the potential spread of infection and are being actively used to inform policy about the management of COVID-19. Our aim was to provide a rapid review and appraisal of the literature on mathematical models investigating COVID-19 infection in a university setting. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, bioRxiv/ medRxiv and sought expert input via social media to identify relevant papers. BioRxiv/ medRxiv and PubMed/Web of Science searches took place on 3 and 6 July 2020, respectively. Papers were restricted to English language. Screening of peer-reviewed and pre-print papers and contact with experts yielded five relevant papers - all of which were pre-prints. All models suggest a significant potential for transmission of COVID-19 in universities. Testing of symptomatic persons and screening of the university community regardless of symptoms, combined with isolation of infected individuals and effective contact tracing were critical for infection control in the absence of other mitigation interventions. When other mitigation interventions were considered (such as moving teaching online, social/physical distancing, and the use of face coverings) the additional value of screening for infection control was limited. Multiple interventions will be needed to control infection spread within the university setting and the interaction with the wider community is an important consideration. Isolation of identified cases and quarantine of contacts is likely to lead to large numbers of students requiring educational, psychological and behavioural support and will likely have a large impact on the attendance of students (and staff), necessitating online options for teaching, even where in-person classes are taking place. Models were highly sensitive to assumptions in the parameters, including the number and type of individuals contacts, number of contacts traced, frequency of screening and delays in testing. Future models could aid policy decisions by considering the incremental benefit of multiple interventions and using empirical data on mixing within the university community and with the wider community where available. Universities will need to be able to adapt quickly to the evolving situation locally to support the health and wellbeing of the university and wider communities.","Christensen, H.; Turner, K.; Trickey, A.; Booton, R.

2793,A Model Describing COVID-19 Community Transmission Taking into Account Asymptomatic Carriers and Risk Mitigation,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel human respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Asymptomatic carriers of the COVID-19 virus display no clinical symptoms but are known to be contagious. Recent evidence reveals that this subpopulation, as well as persons with mild disease, are a major contributor in the propagation of the disease. The rapid spread of COVID-19 forced governments around the world to establish and enforce generalized risk mitigation strategies, from lockdowns to guidelines for social distancing, in an effort to minimize community transmission. This created an unprecedented epidemiological situation not properly characterized by existing mathematical models of isolation and quarantine. In this manuscript, we present a mathematical model for community transmission of COVID-19 taking into account asymptomatic carriers and varying degrees of risk mitigation. The main results consist of an exact calculation of the effective reproduction number [Formula], and a modeling framework that enables the quantification of the effect of risk mitigation and asymptomatism on community transmission. A computation of [Formula] is provided using mean parameters. The point estimate of the basic reproduction number is [Formula].","Aguilar, J. B.; Faust, J. S.; Westafer, L. M.; Gutierrez, J.

8410,Forecasting COVID-19 pandemic in Poland according to government regulations and people behavior,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is a worldwide pandemic problem that started in China in December 2019 and within a few months spread to all continents. Very high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 virus and substantial disease severity caused medical care capacity shortage in many countries. Therefore, real-time epidemic forecasting of the COVID-19 is useful to plan public health strategies like country lockdown and healthcare reorganization.

We used extended susceptible-infected-removed (eSIR) model to predict the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in Poland under different scenarios of the lockdown and lockdown removal. We used time-series data of SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 4 to May 22 2020. Our forecast includes the impact of a timeline of preventive measures introduced in Poland. Using eSIR algorithm we estimated the basic reproductive number and a total number of infections under different epidemic trend scenarios.

Using eSIR modeling we estimated that the basic reproductive number in Poland concerning different scenarios of the lockdown removal is in a range of 3.91-4.79. The lowest predicted number of infected cases would be 263 900 (0 - 1 734 200, 95%CI) if the strict protective measures were maintained until the end of September. However, under different scenarios of precautions removal, a total number of infected cases may exceed one million within the next year.

Relatively early introduction of strong precautions in Poland significantly slowed down epidemic spread in Poland in comparison with other European countries like Italy or Spain. However, early removal of protective measures may result in a significant increase in infection. Data shows that the number of new COVID-19 cases in Poland beyond May 18 is linear what could be a prognosis of a duration of the epidemic exceeding 300 days.","Orzechowska, M.; Bednarek, A.

MethodsUsing a simulation-based model of viral transmission we tested the impact of different intervention measures for the control of COVID-19.

ResultsThe use of an antiviral drug, in combination with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, results in a significant decrease of the mean final size and the peak incidence of local outbreaks of COVID-19, provided delays in contact tracing are small.

ConclusionsIntegrating antiviral drugs together with contact tracing and quarantine is predicted through this model to be an effective tool for the control of local outbreaks of COVID-19.","Torneri, A.; Libin, P.

15429,Vent-Lock: A 3D Printed Ventilator Multiplexer to Enhance the Capacity of Treating Patients with COVID-19,"Mechanical ventilators are essential to patients who become critically ill from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and shortages have been reported due to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We utilized cost-effective, on-demand 3D printing (3DP) technology to produce critical components for a novel ventilator multiplexer system, Vent-Lock, to split one ventilator or anesthesia gas machine between two patients. FloRest, a novel 3DP flow restrictor, provides clinicians control of tidal volumes and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), using the 3DP manometer adaptor to monitor pressures. We tested the ventilator splitter circuit in simulation centers between artificial lungs and used an anesthesia gas machine to successfully ventilate two swines. As one of the first studies to demonstrate splitting one anesthesia gas machine between two swines, we present proof-of-concept of a de novo, closed, multiplexing system, with flow restriction for individualized patient therapy. Our studies underscore that while possible, ventilator multiplexing is a complicated synergy between machine settings, circuit modification, and patient monitoring. Consequently, ventilator multiplexing is reserved only as a last emergency resource, by trained clinicians and respiratory therapists with ventilator operative experience.","Xun, H.; Shallal, C.; Unger, J.; Tao, R.; Torres, A.; Vladimirov, M.; Frye, J.; Singhala, M.; Horne, B.; Yesantharao, P.; Kim, B.

25619,Ethnic differences in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy in United Kingdom healthcare workers: Results from the UK-REACH prospective nationwide cohort study,"BackgroundIn most countries, healthcare workers (HCWs) represent a priority group for vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) due to their elevated risk of COVID-19 and potential contribution to nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Concerns have been raised that HCWs from ethnic minority groups are more likely to be vaccine hesitant (defined by the World Health Organisation as refusing or delaying a vaccination) than those of White ethnicity, but there are limited data on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy and its predictors in UK HCWs.

MethodsNationwide prospective cohort study and qualitative study in a multi-ethnic cohort of clinical and non-clinical UK HCWs. We analysed ethnic differences in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy adjusting for demographics, vaccine trust, and perceived risk of COVID-19. We explored reasons for hesitancy in qualitative data using a framework analysis.

Findings11,584 HCWs were included in the cohort analysis. 23% (2704) reported vaccine hesitancy. Compared to White British HCWs (21.3% hesitant), HCWs from Black Caribbean (54.2%), Mixed White and Black Caribbean (38.1%), Black African (34.4%), Chinese (33.1%), Pakistani (30.4%), and White Other (28.7%) ethnic groups were significantly more likely to be hesitant. In adjusted analysis, Black Caribbean (aOR 3.37, 95% CI 2.11 - 5.37), Black African (aOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.49 - 2.82), White Other ethnic groups (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.19 - 1.84) were significantly more likely to be hesitant. Other independent predictors of hesitancy were younger age, female sex, higher score on a COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs scale, lower trust in employer, lack of influenza vaccine uptake in the previous season, previous COVID-19, and pregnancy. Qualitative data from 99 participants identified the following contributors to hesitancy: lack of trust in government and employers, safety concerns due to the speed of vaccine development, lack of ethnic diversity in vaccine studies, and confusing and conflicting information. Participants felt uptake in ethnic minority communities might be improved through inclusive communication, involving HCWs in the vaccine rollout, and promoting vaccination through trusted networks.

InterpretationDespite increased risk of COVID-19, HCWs from some ethnic minority groups are more likely to be vaccine hesitant than their White British colleagues. Strategies to build trust and dispel myths surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine in these communities are urgently required. Public health communications should be inclusive, non-stigmatising and utilise trusted networks.

The search returned 60 results, of which 38 were excluded after title and abstract screening, 11 studies were not conducted in a population of healthcare workers, 20 did not present data on vaccine intention or uptake, 5 were related to vaccines other than the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, 1 was unrelated to vaccination and 1 had been withdrawn. The 22 remaining articles were survey studies focussed on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine intention in healthcare workers. Estimates of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine acceptance varied widely from 27{middle dot}7% - 94{middle dot}5% depending on the country in which the study was performed, and the occupational group studied. Only 2 studies (both conducted in the USA) had a sample size greater than 10,000. Most studies found females, non-medical healthcare staff and those refusing influenza vaccine to be more likely to be hesitant. There was conflicting evidence about the effects of age and previous COVID-19 on hesitancy. Only 3 studies (all from the USA), presented data disaggregated by ethnicity, all finding Black ethnic HCWs were most likely to be hesitant. Common themes amongst studies that investigated reasons for vaccine hesitancy were concerns about safety of vaccines, fear of side effects and short development timeframes. We did not find any studies on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy in UK healthcare workers in the published literature.

Added value of this studyThis study is amongst the largest SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy studies in the literature. It is the largest study outside the USA and is the only study in UK HCWs. Our work focusses on the association of ethnicity with vaccine hesitancy, and we are the first study outside the USA to present results by ethnic group. The large number of ethnic minority HCWs in our study allows for examination of the outcome by more granular ethnicity categories than have previously been studied, allowing us to detect important differences in vaccine hesitancy levels within the broad White and Asian ethnic groupings. Our large sample size and the richness of our cohort study dataset allows us to control for many potential confounders in our multivariable analysis, and provide novel data on important potential drivers of hesitancy including discrimination, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, religion/religiosity and personality traits. Additionally, we combine quantitative with qualitative data providing a deeper understanding of the drivers of hesitancy and potential strategies to improve vaccine uptake in HCWs from ethnic minority communities.

Implications of all the available evidenceAround a quarter of UK healthcare workers reported SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy. In accordance with previous studies in other countries, we determined that female sex and lack of influenza vaccine in the previous season were important predictors of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy in UK HCWs, although in contrast to most studies in the published literature, after adjustment we do not demonstrate differences in hesitancy levels by occupational role. Importantly, previous literature provides conflicting evidence of the effects of age and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection on vaccine hesitancy. In our study, younger HCWs and those with evidence of previous COVID-19 were more likely to be hesitant. This study provides novel data on increased hesitancy levels within Black Caribbean, Mixed White and Black Caribbean, Black African, Chinese, Pakistani and White Other ethnic groups. Mistrust (of vaccines in general, in SARS-CoV-2 vaccines specifically, in healthcare systems and research) and misinformation appear to be important drivers of hesitancy within HCWS in the UK. Our data indicate that despite facing an increased risk of COVID-19 compared to their White colleagues, UK HCWs from some ethnic minority groups continue to exhibit greater levels of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy. This study provides policy makers with evidence to inform strategies to improve uptake.","Woolf, K.; Mcmanus, I. C.; Martin, C. A.; Nellums, L. B.; Guyatt, A.

8120,Emergence of Low-density Inflammatory Neutrophils Correlates with Hypercoagulable State and Disease Severity in COVID-19 Patients,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel viral pathogen that causes a clinical disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Approximately 20% of infected patients experience a severe manifestation of the disease, causing bilateral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Severe COVID-19 patients also have a pronounced coagulopathy with approximately 30% of patients experiencing thromboembolic complications. However, the etiology driving the coagulopathy remains unknown. Here, we explore whether the prominent neutrophilia seen in severe COVID-19 patients contributes to inflammation-associated coagulation. We found in severe patients the emergence of a CD16IntCD44lowCD11bInt low-density inflammatory band (LDIB) neutrophil population that trends over time with changes in disease status. These cells demonstrated spontaneous neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, phagocytic capacity, enhanced cytokine production, and associated clinically with D-dimer and systemic IL-6 and TNF- levels, particularly for CD40+ LDIBs. We conclude that the LDIB subset contributes to COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) and could be used as an adjunct clinical marker to monitor disease status and progression. Identifying patients who are trending towards LDIB crisis and implementing early, appropriate treatment could improve all-cause mortality rates for severe COVID-19 patients.

4967,"Exit strategies: optimising feasible surveillance for detection, elimination and ongoing prevention of COVID-19 community transmission","BackgroundFollowing successful implementation of strong containment measures by the community, Australia is now close to the point of eliminating detectable community transmission of COVID-19. We aimed to develop an efficient, rapid and scalable surveillance strategy for detecting all remaining COVID-19 community transmission through exhaustive identification of every active transmission chain. We also identified measures to enable early detection and effective management of any reintroduction of transmission once containment measures are lifted to ensure strong containment measures do not need to be reinstated.

MethodsWe compared efficiency and sensitivity to detect community transmission chains through testing of: hospital cases; primary care fever and cough patients; or asymptomatic community members, using surveillance evaluation methods and mathematical modelling, varying testing capacities and prevalence of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 fever and cough, and the reproduction number. System requirements for increasing testing to allow exhaustive identification of all transmission chains, and then enable complete follow-up of all cases and contacts within each chain, were assessed per million population.

FindingsAssuming 20% of cases are asymptomatic and all symptomatic COVID-19 cases present to primary care, with high transmission (R=2.2) there are a median of 13 unrecognised community cases (5 infectious) when a transmission chain is identified through hospital surveillance versus 3 unrecognised cases (1 infectious) through primary care surveillance. 3 unrecognised community upstream community cases themselves are estimated to generate a further 22-33 contacts requiring follow-up. The unrecognised community cases rise to 5 if only 50% of symptomatic cases present to primary care. Screening for asymptomatic disease in the community cannot exhaustively identify all transmission under any of the scenarios assessed. The additional capacity required to screen all fever and cough primary care patients would be approximately 2,000 tests/million population per week using 1/16 pooling of samples.

InterpretationScreening all syndromic fever and cough primary care presentations, in combination with exhaustive and meticulous case and contact identification and management, enables appropriate early detection and elimination of community transmission of COVID-19. If testing capacity is limited, interventions such as pooling allow increased case detection, even given reduced test sensitivity. Wider identification and testing of all upstream contacts, (i.e. potential sources of infection for identified cases, and their related transmission chains) is critical, and to be done exhaustively requires more resources than downstream contact tracing. The most important factor in determining the performance of such a surveillance system is community participation in screening and follow up, and as such, appropriate community engagement, messaging and support to encourage presentation and compliance is essential. We provide operational guidance on implementing such a system.

21778,A survey of International Health Regulations National Focal Points experiences in carrying out their functions,"BackgroundThe 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR (2005)) require States Parties to establish National Focal Points (NFPs) responsible for notifying the World Health Organization (WHO) of potential events that might constitute public health emergencies of international concern (PHEICs), such as outbreaks of novel infectious diseases. Given the critical role of NFPs in the global surveillance and response system supported by the IHR, we sought to assess their experiences in carrying out their functions.

MethodsIn collaboration with WHO officials, we administered a voluntary online survey to all 196 States Parties to the IHR (2005) in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South and North America, from October to November 2019. The survey was available in six languages via a secure internet-based system.

ResultsIn total, 121 NFP representatives answered the 56-question survey; 105 in full, and an additional 16 in part, resulting in a response rate of 62% (121 responses to 196 invitations to participate). The majority of NFPs knew how to notify the WHO of a potential PHEIC, and believed they have the content expertise to carry out their functions. Respondents found training workshops organized by WHO Regional Offices helpful on how to report PHEICs. NFPs experienced challenges in four critical areas: 1) insufficient intersectoral collaboration within their countries, including limited access to, or a lack of cooperation from, key relevant ministries; 2) inadequate communications, such as deficient information technology systems in place to carry out their functions in a timely fashion; 3) lack of authority to report potential PHEICs; and 4) inadequacies in some resources made available by the WHO, including a key tool - the NFP Guide. Finally, many NFP representatives expressed concern about how WHO uses the information they receive from NFPs.

ConclusionOur study, conducted just prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, illustrates key challenges experienced by NFPs that can affect States Parties and WHO performance when outbreaks occur. In order for NFPs to be able to rapidly and successfully communicate potential PHEICs such as COVID-19 in the future, continued measures need to be taken by both WHO and States Parties to ensure NFPs have the necessary authority, capacity, training, and resources to effectively carry out their functions as described in the IHR.","Packer, C.; Halabi, S.

12688,Clinical manifestations of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) attending at hospitals in Bangladesh,"Bangladesh is in the rising phase of the ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The scientific literature on clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients from Bangladesh is scarce. This study aimed to report the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We conducted a cross-sectional study at three dedicated COVID-19 hospitals. The severity of the COVID-19 cases was assessed based on the WHO interim guidance. Data were collected only from non-critical COVID-19 patients as critical patients required immediate intensive care admission making them unable to respond to the questions. A total of 103 RT-PCR confirmed non-critical COVID-19 patients were enrolled. Most of the patients (71.8%) were male. Mild, moderate and severe illness were assessed in 74.76%, 9.71% and 15.53% of patients respectively. Nearly 52.4% of patients had a co-morbidity, with hypertension being the most common (34%), followed by diabetes mellitus (21.4%) and ischemic heart disease (9.7%). Fever (78.6%), weakness (68%) and cough (44.7%) were the most common clinical manifestations. Other common symptoms included loss of appetite (37.9%), difficulty in breathing (37.9%), altered sensation of taste or smell (35.0%), headache (32%) and body ache (32%). The median time from onset of symptom to attending hospitals was 7 days (IQR 4-10). This study will help both the clinicians and epidemiologists to understand the magnitude and clinical spectrum of COVID-19 patients in Bangladesh.","Morshed, M. S.; Mosabbir, A.

7398,The infection fatality rate of COVID-19 inferred from seroprevalence data,"ObjectiveTo estimate the infection fatality rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from data of seroprevalence studies.

MethodsPopulation studies with sample size of at least 500 and published as peer-reviewed papers or preprints as of July 11, 2020 were retrieved from PubMed, preprint servers, and communications with experts. Studies on blood donors were included, but studies on healthcare workers were excluded. The studies were assessed for design features and seroprevalence estimates. Infection fatality rate was estimated from each study dividing the number of COVID-19 deaths at a relevant time point by the number of estimated people infected in each relevant region. Correction was also attempted accounting for the types of antibodies assessed. Secondarily, results from national studies were also examined from preliminary press releases and reports whenever a country had no other data presented in full papers of preprints.

Results36 studies (43 estimates) were identified with usable data to enter into calculations and another 7 preliminary national estimates were also considered for a total of 50 estimates. Seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.222% to 47%. Infection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 1.63% and corrected values ranged from 0.00% to 1.31%. Across 32 different locations, the median infection fatality rate was 0.27% (corrected 0.24%). Most studies were done in pandemic epicenters with high death tolls. Median corrected IFR was 0.10% in locations with COVID-19 population mortality rate less than the global average (<73 deaths per million as of July 12, 2020), 0.27% in locations with 73-500 COVID-19 deaths per million, and 0.90% in locations exceeding 500 COVID-19 deaths per million. Among people <70 years old, infection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 0.57% with median of 0.05% across the different locations (corrected median of 0.04%).

ConclusionsThe infection fatality rate of COVID-19 can vary substantially across different locations and this may reflect differences in population age structure and case-mix of infected and deceased patients as well as multiple other factors. Estimates of infection fatality rates inferred from seroprevalence studies tend to be much lower than original speculations made in the early days of the pandemic.","Ioannidis, J.",2020-07-14,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.13.20101253,3,John Ioannidis,Stanford University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.20101253v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.20101253v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.2471/BLT.20.265892
6459,Multivariate Prediction Network Model for epidemic progression to study the effects of lockdown time and coverage on a closed community on theoretical and real scenarios of COVID-19.,"The aim of this study was to develop a realistic network model to predict the relationship between lockdown duration and coverage in controlling the progression of the incidence curve of an epidemic with the characteristics of COVID-19 in two scenarios (1) a closed and non-immune population, and (2) a real scenario from State of Rio de Janeiro from May 6th 2020.

Effects of lockdown time and rate on the progression of an epidemic incidence curve in a virtual population of 10 thousand subjects. Predictor variables were reproductive values established in the most recent literature (R0 =2.7 and 5.7, and Re = 1.28 from Rio de Janeiro State at May 6th), without lockdown and with coverages of 25%, 50%, and 90% for 21, 35, 70, and 140 days in up to 13 different scenarios for each R0/Re, where individuals remained infected and transmitters for 14 days. We estimated model validity in theoretical and real scenarios respectively by applying an exponential model on the incidence curve with no lockdown with growth rate coefficient observed in realistic scenarios, and (2) fitting real data series from RJ upon simulated data, respectively.

For R0=5.7, the flattening of the curve occurs only with long lockdown periods (70 and 140 days) with a 90% coverage. For R0=2.7, coverages of 25 and 50% also result in curve flattening and reduction of total cases, provided they occur for a long period (70 days or more). For realistic scenario in Rio de Janeiro, lockdowns +25% or more from May 6th during 140 days showed expressive flattening and number of COVID cases two to five times lower. If a more intense coverage lockdown (about +25 to +50% as much as the current one) will be implemented until June 6th during at least 70 days, it is still possible reduce nearly 40-50% the impact of pandemy in state of Rio de Janeiro.

These data corroborate the importance of lockdown duration regardless of virus transmission and sometimes of intensity of coverage, either in realistic or theoretical scenarios of COVID-10 epidemics. Even later, the improvement of lockdown coverage can be effective to minimize the impact of epidemic.","Abramov, D. M.; Gomes Junior, S.

21128,Deficient hand washing facilities in public toilets in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic: A survey in one high-income country,"AimsTo identify the extent of the provision of water and soap for hand washing in public toilets at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. To also make comparisons with a pre-pandemic survey that included a sample of the same facilities.

MethodsWe collected data from 400 toilets that were open to the public; all those in three contiguous city council territories (228) and a further convenience sample of 172 around the rest of New Zealand. Comparisons were made with the data on the same facilities included in a 2012/2013 survey.

ResultsFor all the toilets in this survey, 2.5% had no water for hand washing and 14.8% had no soap. There was COVID-19 related health messaging signage in 19.5% of toilets, with posters of the COVID-19 QR code used to facilitate contact tracing in 12.3%, and generic hand washing signage in 1.8%. The hand washing water had """"no touch"""" activation at 28.0% of toilets and at 18.5% for toilet bowl flushing. Toilet bowl lids were not present at 32.8%, and 2.3% of toilets had damage which would impair their functionality (eg, broken toilet seats). For the 128 sites that had also been examined in the previous survey, this new survey found significantly increased provision of soap (risk ratio = 1.47; 95%CI: 1.25 to 1.72), but no increased provision of water.

ConclusionsDespite the serious threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of hand washing facilities in public toilets sampled required tap touching, and did not have health messaging. Nevertheless there has been some modest improvements in soap (but not water) provision since the previous survey eight years before.","Wilson, N.; Thomson, G.",2021-01-20,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.01.19.21250124,1,Nick Wilson,"University of Otago, Wellington",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.19.21250124v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.19.21250124v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
8498,Efficacy and safety of interferon beta-1a in treatment of severe COVID-19: A randomized clinical trial,"ObjectivesTo the best of our knowledge, there is no published study regarding use of IFN {beta}-1a in the treatment of severe COVID-19. In this randomized clinical trial efficacy and safety of IFN {beta}-1a has been evaluated in patients with severe COVID-19.

MethodsForty-two patients in the interferon group received IFN {beta}-1a in addition to the standard of care. Each 44 micrograms/ml (12 million IU/ml) of interferon {beta}-1a was subcutaneously injected three times weekly for two consecutive weeks. The control group received only the standard of care. Primary outcome of study was time to reach clinical response. Secondary outcomes duration of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, 28-day mortality, effect of early or late administration of IFN on mortality, adverse effects and complications during the hospitalization.

ResultsAs primary outcome, time to the clinical response was not significantly different between the IFN and the control groups (9.7 {+/-} 5.8 vs. 8.3 {+/-} 4.9 days respectively, P = 0.95). On day 14, 66.7% vs. 43.6% of patients in the IFN group and the control group were discharged, respectively (OR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.05-6.37). The 28-day overall mortality was significantly lower in the IFN then the control group (19% vs. 43.6% respectively, p = 0.015). Early administration significantly reduced mortality (OR = 13.5; 95% CI: 1.5-118).

ConclusionAlthough did not change time to reach the clinical response, adding to the standard of care significantly increased discharge rate on day 14 and decreased 28-day mortality.","Davoudi-Monfared, E.; Rahmani, H.; Khalili, H.; Hajiabdolbaghi, M.; Salehi, M.; Abbasian, L.; Kazemzadeh, H.; Yekaninejad, M.

12327,"Comparison of viral levels in individuals with or without symptoms at time of COVID-19 testing among 32,480 residents and staff of nursing homes and assisted living facilities in Massachusetts.","BackgroundTransmission of COVID-19 from people without symptoms poses considerable challenges to public health containment measures. The distribution of viral loads in individuals with and without symptoms remains uncertain. Comprehensive cross-sectional screening of all individuals in a given setting provides an unbiased way to assess viral loads independent of symptoms, which informs transmission risks. COVID-19 cases initially peaked in Massachusetts in mid-April 2020 before declining through June, and congregate living facilities were particularly affected during this early surge. We performed a retrospective analysis of data from a large public health-directed outbreak response initiative that involved comprehensive screening within nursing homes and assisted living facilities in Massachusetts to compare nasopharyngeal (NP) viral loads (as measured by RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) levels) in residents and staff to inform our ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with or without symptoms in the population.

MethodsBetween April 9 and June 9, 2020, we tested NP swabs from 32,480 unique individuals comprising staff and residents of the majority of nursing homes and assisted living facilities in Massachusetts. Under the direction of the MA Department of Public Health (MDPH), symptomatology at the time of sampling and demographic information was provided by each facility for each individual to facilitate reporting to health officials. NP swabs were collected, RNA extracted, and SARS-CoV-2 testing performed using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).

ResultsThe nursing home and assisted living facilities resident cohort (N =16,966) was 65% female with a mean age of 82 years (SD 13 yrs). The staff cohort (N = 15,514) was 76% female with a median age of 45 (SD 15 yrs). A total 2654 residents (15.5%) and 624 staff (4.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 12.7% of residents and 3.7% of staff without symptoms tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, compared to 53.1% of residents and 18.2% of staff with symptoms. Of the individuals who tested positive, 70.8% of residents and 92.4% of staff lacked symptoms at the time of testing. In aggregate, the distributions of Cts for viral probes used in the qRT-PCR assay were very similar, with a statistically but not meaningfully different mean ({Delta}Ct 0.71 cycles, p = 0.006) and a similar range (12-38 cycles), between populations with and without symptoms over the entire time period, across all sub-categories examined (age, race, ethnicity, sex, resident/staff). Importantly, the Ct mean values and range were indistinguishable between the populations by symptom class during the peak of the outbreak in Massachusetts, with a Ct gap appearing only later in the survey period, reaching >3 cycles (p [&le;] 0.001) for facilities sampled during the last two weeks of the study.

ConclusionsIn a large cohort of individuals screened for SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR, we found strikingly similar distributions of viral load in patients with or without symptoms at the time of testing during the local peak of the epidemic; as the epidemic waned, individuals without symptoms at the time of testing had lower viral loads. The size of the study population, including both staff and residents spanning a wide range of ages, provides a comprehensive cross-sectional point prevalence measurement of viral burden in a study spanning 2 months. Because the distributions of viral loads in infected individuals irrespective of symptomatology are very similar, existing testing modalities that have been validated for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in symptomatic patients should perform similarly in individuals without symptoms at the time of testing.","Lennon, N.

15933,Impact of reproduction number on multiwave spreading dynamics of COVID-19 with temporary immunity : a mathematical model,"COVID-19 is caused by a hitherto nonexistent pathogen, hence the immune response to the disease is currently unknown. Studies conducted over the past few weeks have found that the antibody titre levels in the blood plasma of infected patients decrease over time, as is common for acute viral infections. Fully documented reinfection cases from Hong Kong, India, Belgium and USA, as well as credible to anecdotal evidence of second-time cases from other countries, bring into sharp focus the question of what profile the epidemic trajectories may take if immunity were really to be temporary in a significant fraction of the population. Here we use mathematical modeling to answer this question, constructing a novel delay differential equation model which is tailored to accommodate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) where a recovered case becomes completely susceptible after a given time interval following infection and (b) where a first-time recovered case becomes susceptible to a lower virulence infection after a given time interval following recovery, and becomes permanently immunized by a second infection. We find possible solutions exhibiting large number of waves of disease in the first situation and two to three waves in the second situation. Interestingly however, these multiple wave solutions are manifest only for some intermediate values of the reproduction number R, which is governed by public health intervention measures. For sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the short-lived immunity. Our results cast insight into the potential spreading dynamics of the disease and might also be useful for analysing the spread after a vaccine is invented, and mass vaccination programs initiated.","Shayak, B.; Sharma, M.

24328,Monozygotic twins discordant for severe clinical recurrence of COVID-19 show drastically distinct T cell responses to SARS-Cov-2,"BackgroundClinical recurrence of COVID-19 in convalescent patients has been reported, which immune mechanisms have not been thoroughly investigated. Presence of neutralizing antibodies suggests other types of immune response are involved.

MethodsWe assessed the innate type I/III IFN response, T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 with IFN{gamma} ELISPOT, binding and neutralizing antibody assays, in two monozygotic twin pairs with one COVID-19 recurrence case.

ResultsIn pair 1, four months after a first mild episode of infection for both siblings, one displayed severe clinical recurrence of COVID-19. Twin pair 2 of siblings underwent non-recurring asymptomatic infection. All fours individuals presented similar overall responses, except for remarkably difference found in specific cellular responses. Recurring sibling presented a reduced number of recognized T cell epitopes as compared to the other three including her non-recurring sibling.

ConclusionsOur results suggest that an effective SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immune response is key for complete viral control and avoidance of clinical recurrence of COVID-19. Besides, adaptive immunity can be distinct in MZ twins. Given the rising concern about SARS-CoV-2 variants that evade neutralizing antibodies elicited by vaccination or infection, our study stresses the importance of T cell responses in protection against recurrence/reinfection.

Key pointsImmune parameters leading to COVID-19 recurrence/reinfection are incompletely understood. A COVID-19 recurrence case in a monozygotic twin pair is described with an intact antibody and innate type I/III Interferon response and drastically reduced number of recognized SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes.","Castro, M.

24404,IL-15 and sMAdCAM: Novel roles in COVID-19 pathogenesis,"Immune cell dysregulation and lymphopenia characterize COVID-19 pathology in moderate to severe disease. While underlying inflammatory factors have been extensively studied, homeostatic and mucosal migratory signatures remain largely unexplored as causative factors. In this study we evaluated the association of circulating IL-6, soluble mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (sMAdCAM) and IL-15 with cellular dysfunction characterizing mild and hypoxemic stages of COVID-19. A cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (n=125) at various stages of disease progression together with healthy controls (n=16) were recruited from COVID Care Centres (CCCs) across Mumbai, India. Multiparametric flow cytometry was used to perform in-depth immune subset characterization and to measure plasma IL-6 levels. sMAdCAM, IL-15 levels were quantified using ELISA. Distinct depletion profiles, with relative sparing of CD8 effector memory and CD4+ regulatory T cells was observed in hypoxemic disease within the lymphocyte compartment. An apparent increase in the frequency of intermediate monocytes characterized both mild as well as hypoxemic disease. IL-6 levels inversely correlated with those of sMAdCAM and both markers showed converse associations with observed lympho-depletion suggesting opposing roles in pathogenesis. Interestingly, IL-15, a key cytokine involved in lymphocyte activation and homeostasis, was detected in symptomatic individuals but not in healthy controls or asymptomatic cases. Further, negative association of plasma IL-15 with depleted T, B and NK subsets suggested a compensatory production of this cytokine in response to the profound lymphopenia. Finally, higher levels of plasma IL-15 and IL-6, but not sMAdCAM, were associated with longer duration of hospitalization.","Singh, A. K.; Kasarpalkar, N. J.; Bhowmick, S. D.

10182,COVID-19 severity is associated with immunopathology and multi-organ damage,"COVID-19 is characterised by dysregulated immune responses, metabolic dysfunction and adverse effects on the function of multiple organs. To understand how host responses contribute to COVID-19 pathophysiology, we used a multi-omics approach to identify molecular markers in peripheral blood and plasma samples that distinguish COVID-19 patients experiencing a range of disease severities. A large number of expressed genes, proteins, metabolites and extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) were identified that exhibited strong associations with various clinical parameters. Multiple sets of tissue-specific proteins and exRNAs varied significantly in both mild and severe patients, indicative of multi-organ damage. The continuous activation of IFN-I signalling and neutrophils, as well as a high level of inflammatory cytokines, were observed in severe disease patients. In contrast, COVID-19 in mild patients was characterised by robust T cell responses. Finally, we show that some of expressed genes, proteins and exRNAs can be used as biomarkers to predict the clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

21005,Electronic Computer-Based Model of Combined Ventilation Using a New Medical Device,"IntroductionThe increased demand for mechanical ventilation caused by SARS-CoV-2 could generate a critical situation where patients may lose access to mechanical ventilators. Combined ventilation, in which two patients are connected to a single ventilator has been proposed as a bridge while waiting for new ventilators availability. DuplicAR is a new device that allows individualization of ventilatory parameters in combined ventilation models.

Materials and MethodsWith an electronic circuit simulator applet, an electrical model of combined ventilation was created using resistor-capacitor circuits. The DuplicAR system electrical analog was added to the model. Through computational simulation, the model is tested in different scenarios with the aim of achieving adequate ventilation of two subjects under different circumstances: 1) two identical subjects; 2) two subjects with the same size but different lung compliance; and 3) two subjects with different size and compliance. The goal is to achieve the established load per unit of size on each capacitor under different levels of end-expiratory voltage (analog of end-expiratory pressure). Data collected included capacitor load and voltage, and load normalized to the weight of the simulated patient.

ResultsIn the three simulated stages, it is possible to provide the proper load to each capacitor under different circumstances. If the pair of connected capacitors have different capacitances, adjustments must be made to the source voltage and/or the resistance of the DuplicAR system to provide the appropriate load for each capacitor under initial conditions. In pressure control simulation, increasing the end-expiratory voltage on one capacitor requires increasing the source voltage and the resistance on the other capacitor. On the other hand, in the volume control simulation, it is only required to intervene in the resistance.

ConclusionsUnder simulated conditions, the electrical model of the DuplicAR system allows individualization of combined mechanical ventilation.","Ramos, M.; Orofino, R.; Riva, D.; Biancolini, M.

2989,"COVID-19 infection induces readily detectable morphological and inflammation-related phenotypic changes in peripheral blood monocytes, the severity of which correlate with patient outcome","BackgroundExcessive monocyte/macrophage activation with the development of a cytokine storm and subsequent acute lung injury, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a feared consequence of infection with COVID-19. The ability to recognize and potentially intervene early in those patients at greatest risk of developing this complication could be of great clinical utility.

MethodsWe performed detailed flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood samples from 28 COVID-19 patients treated at Xian No.8 Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University in early 2020 in an attempt to identify factors that could help predict severity of disease and patient outcome.

FindingsWhile we did not detect significant differences in the number of monocytes between patients with COVID-19 and normal healthy individuals,we did identify significant morphological and functional differences, which are more pronounced in patients requiring prolonged hospitalization and ICU admission. Patients with COVID-19 have larger than normal monocytes, easily identified on forward scatter, side scatter analysis by routine flow cytometry,with the presence of a distinct population of monocytes with high forward scatter (FSC-high). On more detailed analysis, these FSC-high monocytes are CD11b+, CD14+, CD16+, CD68+, CD80+, CD163+, CD206+ and secrete IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha, consistent with an inflammatory phenotype.

ConclusionsThe detection and serial monitoring of this subset of inflammatory monocytes using flow cytometry could be of great help in guiding the prognostication and treatment of patients with COVID-19 and merits further evaluation.","Zhang, D.; Guo, R.; Lei, L.; Liu, H.; Wang, Y.; Wang, Y.; Dai, T.; Zhang, T.; Lai, Y.; Wang, J.; Liu, Z.; He, A.; O'dwyer, M.; Hu, J.",2020-03-26,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.24.20042655,1,Jinsong Hu,Xi\'an Jiaotong University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042655v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042655v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
15197,Improved estimation of time-varying reproduction numbers at low case incidence and between epidemic waves,"We construct a recursive Bayesian smoother, termed EpiFilter, for estimating the effective reproduction number, R, from the incidence of an infectious disease in real time and retrospectively. Our approach borrows from Kalman filtering theory, is quick and easy to compute, generalisable, deterministic and unlike many current methods, requires no change-point or window size assumptions. We model R as a flexible, hidden Markov state process and exactly solve forward-backward algorithms, to derive R estimates that incorporate all available incidence information. This unifies and extends two popular methods, EpiEstim, which considers past incidence, and the Wallinga-Teunis method, which looks forward in time. We find that this combination of maximising information and minimising assumptions significantly reduces the bias and variance of R estimates. Moreover, these properties make EpiFilter more statistically robust in periods of low incidence, where existing methods can become destabilised. As a result, EpiFilter offers improved inference of time-varying transmission patterns that are especially advantageous for assessing the risk of upcoming waves of infection in real time and at various spatial scales.

Author SummaryInferring changes in the transmissibility of an infectious disease is crucial for understanding and controlling epidemic spread. The effective reproduction number, R, is widely used to assess transmissibility. R measures the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case and has provided insight into many diseases including COVID-19. An upsurge in R can forewarn of upcoming infections, while suppression of R can indicate if public health interventions are working. Reliable estimates of temporal changes in R can contribute important evidence to policymaking. Popular R-inference methods, while powerful, can struggle when cases are few because data are noisy. This can limit detection of crucial variations in transmissibility that may occur, for example, when infections are waning or when analysing transmissibility over fine geographic scales. In this paper we improve the general reliability of R-estimates and specifically increase robustness when cases are few. By adapting principles from control engineering, we formulate EpiFilter, a novel method for inferring R in real time and retrospectively. EpiFilter can potentially double the information extracted from epidemic time-series (when compared to popular approaches), significantly filtering the noise within data to minimise both bias and uncertainty of R-estimates and enhance the detection of salient changepoints in transmissibility.","Parag, K.

4231,Potency and timing of antiviral therapy as determinants of duration of SARS CoV-2 shedding and intensity of inflammatory response,"Treatments are desperately needed to lower the hospitalization and case fatality rates of SARS CoV-2 infection. In order to meaningfully impact the COVID-19 pandemic, promising antiviral therapies must be identified within the next several months. However, the number of clinical trials that can be performed in this timeframe is limited. We therefore developed a mathematical model which allows projection of all possible therapeutic approaches. Our model recapitulates off-treatment viral dynamics and predicts a three-phase immune response. Addition of treatment with remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, neutralizing antibodies or cellular immunotherapy demonstrates that if in vivo drug potency is high, then rapid elimination of virus is possible. Potent therapies dosed soon after peak viral load when infected people typically develop symptoms, are predicted to decrease shedding duration and intensity of the effector immune response, but to have little effect on viral area under the curve, which is driven by high levels of early SARS CoV-2 replication. Potent therapy dosed prior to peak viral load, when infection is usually pre-symptomatic, is predicted to be the only option to lower viral area under the curve. We also identify that clinically meaningful drug resistance is less likely to emerge with a highly potent agent that is dosed after peak viral load. Our results support an early test and treat approach for COVID-19, but also demonstrate the need to identify early viral shedding kinetic features that are the most predictive surrogates of clinical severity and transmission risk.

11599,Clinical Electroencephalography Findings and Considerations in Hospitalized Patients with Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,"Background and PurposeReports have suggested that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes neurologic manifestations including encephalopathy and seizures. However, there has been relatively limited electrophysiology data to contextualize these specific concerns and to understand their associated clinical factors. Our objective was to identify EEG abnormalities present in patients with SARS-CoV-2, and to determine whether they reflect new or preexisting brain pathology.

MethodsWe studied a consecutive series of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 who received an EEG, obtained using tailored safety protocols. Data from EEG reports and clinical records were analyzed to identify EEG abnormalities and possible clinical associations, including neurologic symptoms, new or preexisting brain pathology, and sedation practices.

ResultsWe identified 37 patients with SARS-CoV-2 who underwent EEG, of whom 14 had epileptiform findings (38%). Patients with epileptiform findings were more likely to have preexisting brain pathology (6/14, 43%) than patients without epileptiform findings (2/23, 9%; p=0.042). There were no clear differences in rates of acute brain pathology. One case of nonconvulsive status epilepticus was captured, but was not clearly a direct consequence of SARS-CoV-2.

Abnormalities of background rhythms were common, and patients recently sedated were more likely to lack a posterior dominant rhythm (p=0.022).

ConclusionsEpileptiform abnormalities were common in patients with SARS-CoV-2 referred for EEG, but particularly in the context of preexisting brain pathology and sedation. These findings suggest that neurologic manifestations during SARS-CoV-2 infection may not solely relate to the infection itself, but rather may also reflect patients broader, preexisting neurologic vulnerabilities.","Ayub, N.; Cohen, J.; Jing, J.; Jain, A.; Tesh, R.; Mukerji, S.

8874,Multi-parametric disease dynamics study and analysis of the COVID-19 epidemic and implementation of population-wide intrusions: The Indian perspective,"The outbreak of COVID-19 had spread at a deadly rate since its onset at Wuhan, China and is now spread across 216 countries and has affected more than 6 million people all over the world. The global response throughout the world has been primarily the implementation of lockdown measures, testing and contact tracing to minimise the spread of the disease. The aim of the present study was to predict the COVID-19 prevalence and disease progression rate in Indian scenario in order to provide an analysis that can shed light on comprehending the trends of the outbreak and outline an impression of the epidemiological stage for each state of a diverse country like India. In addition, the forecast of COVID-19 incidence trends of these states can help take safety measures and policy design for this epidemic in the days to come. In order to achieve the same, we have utilized an approach where we test modelling choices of the spatially unambiguous kind, proposed by the wave of infections spreading from the initial slow progression to a higher curve. We have estimated the parameters of an individual state using factors like population density and mobility. The findings can also be used to strategize the testing and quarantine processes to manipulate the spread of the disease in the future. This is especially important for a country like India that has several limitations about healthcare infrastructure, diversity in socioeconomic status, high population density, housing conditions, health care coverage that can be important determinants for the overall impact of the pandemic. The results of our 5-phase model depict a projection of the state wise infections/disease over time.

24252,Predicting the Ophthalmic Surgical Backlog as a Result of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A population-based study and microsimulation model to inform surgical recovery plans,"BackgroundJurisdictions worldwide ramped down ophthalmic surgeries to mitigate the effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), creating a global surgical backlog. We sought to predict the long-term impact of COVID-19 on ophthalmology surgical care delivery.

MethodsThis is a population-based study and a microsimulation model for predicting future outcomes. Provincial administrative data from January 2019 to November 2020 was used to estimate the decline in surgical volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic. For the post-pandemic recovery phase, we estimated the resources required to clear the backlog of patients accumulated on the waitlist since the pandemic.

ResultsA total of 56,923 patients were on the waitlist in the province of Ontario awaiting non-emergency ophthalmic surgery as of March 15, 2020. The number of non-emergency surgeries performed in the province decreased by 45-98% between March to May 2020 compared to the same months in 2019. By 2 years and 3 years, the overall estimated number of patients awaiting surgery grew by 125% and 148%, respectively. The mean wait time for patients for all subspecialty surgeries increased to 198.49 days (SD 81.38) in March 2021 compared to 94.41 days (SD 97.42) in 2019. The provincial monthly additional resources required to clear the backlog by March 2023 was estimated to be 126% (3,538 additional surgeries).

DiscussionThe magnitude of the ophthalmic surgical backlog from COVID-19 has important implications for the recovery phase. The estimates from the surgical database and microsimulation modelling can be adapted to other jurisdictions to assist with recovery planning.","Felfeli, T.; Ximenes, R.; Naimark, D. M.; Hooper, P.

12433,Changes in Cause-of-Death Attribution During the Covid-19 Pandemic: Association with Hospital Quality Metrics and Implications for Future Research,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is often comorbid with conditions subject to quality metrics (QM) used for hospital performance assessment and rate-setting. Although diagnostic coding change in response to financial incentives is well documented, no study has examined the association of QM with SARS-CoV-2 cause-of-death attribution (CODA). Calculations of excess all-cause deaths overlook the importance of accurate CODA and of distinguishing policy-related from virus-related mortality.

ObjectiveExamine CODA, overall and for QM and non-QM diagnoses, in 3 pandemic periods: awareness (January 19-March 14), height (March 15-May 16), and late (May 17-June 20).

MethodsRetrospective analysis of publicly available national weekly COD data, adjusted for population growth and reporting lags, October 2014-June 20, 2020. CODA in 5 pre-pandemic influenza seasons was compared with 2019-20. Suitability of the data to distinguish policy-related from virus-related effects was assessed.

ResultsFollowing federal guidance permitting SARS-CoV-2 CODA without laboratory testing, mortality from the QM diagnoses cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease declined steadily relative to prior-season means, reaching 4.4% less and 12.1% less, respectively, in late pandemic. Deaths for non-QM diagnoses increased, by 21.0% for Alzheimers disease and 29.0% for diabetes during pandemic height. Increases in competing CODs over historical experience, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 underreporting, more than offset declines during pandemic height. However, in the late-pandemic period, declines slightly numerically exceeded increases, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 overreporting. In pandemic-height and late-pandemic periods, respectively, only 83.5% and 69.7% of increases in all-cause deaths were explained by changes in the reported CODs, including SARS-CoV-2, preventing assessment of policy-related mortality or of factors contributing to increased all-cause deaths.

ConclusionsSubstitution of SARS-CoV-2 for competing CODs may have occurred, particularly for QM diagnoses and late in the pandemic. Continued monitoring of these trends, qualitative research on pandemic CODA, and the addition of place-of-death data and psychiatric CODs to the file would facilitate assessment of policy-related and virus-related effects on mortality.

Ascertainment of the number of deaths from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is foundational to understanding the severity, scope, and spread of the infection. Despite its importance, estimation of SARS-CoV-2 deaths is challenging because advanced age, genetic polymorphisms, and obesity-related comorbidities that predispose to inflammatory states increase the likelihood of dysregulated immunological function, severe respiratory distress, and mortality from infectious respiratory illness.1,2 These host factors represent competing potential causes of death (COD). For example, 98.8% of Italys SARS-CoV-2 deaths occurred in persons with >1 comorbidity, 48.6% with >3 comorbidities, and median decedent age was 80 years.3 Similarly, of U.S. SARS-CoV-2 deaths reported as of May 28, 2020, 93% involved other CODs (mean 2.5 additional causes), and 60% occurred in persons aged >75 years.4 This pattern of multiple contributing CODs is common in respiratory infection-related mortality.5

In death certificate issuance during the pandemic, methods to account for this pattern varied, as no single standard for SARS-CoV-2-attributable death exists. In Italy, all deaths in patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 were attributed to the infection despite high prevalence rates for comorbid conditions, measured in early deaths: ischemic heart disease (30%), diabetes (36%), cancer (20%), and atrial fibrillation (25%).6 The U.S. National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) issued death-certification guidance on March 4, 2020, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 should be reported if """"the disease caused or is assumed to have caused or contributed to death.""""7 Follow-up guidance issued on April 3 indicated that it was """"acceptable to report COVID-19 on a death certificate without [laboratory test] confirmation"""" if circumstances indicating likely infection were """"compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty.""""8

This nonspecific guidance should be interpreted in light of previous research findings that COD attribution (CODA) errors are common on death certificates, particularly in infectious disease and septic shock.9,10 In one survey of New York City (NYC) resident physicians in 2010, 49% indicated they had knowingly reported an inaccurate COD on one or more certificates, often (54%) at the behest of hospital staff, and 70% reported they had at least once been unable to report septic shock """"as an accepted cause of death"""" and had been """"forced to list an alternate cause.""""9 In an audit of NYC data from 2010-2014, 67% of pneumonia death certificates contained >1 error, compared with 46% for cancer and 32% for diabetes.10

Such CODA ambiguities are often addressed by calculating """"excess deaths,"""" defined as all-cause deaths exceeding those projected from historical experience.11 This method, recently used to estimate that official tallies of SARS-CoV-2 deaths represented only about 66%-78% of the diseases true mortality impact,12,13 is potentially advantageous in estimating SARS-CoV-2 impact by accounting for deaths that may not have been explicitly coded as infection-related.14 Examples include deaths from cardiac events to which undetected SARS-CoV-2 may have contributed15 or out-of-hospital deaths occurring without medical care because of health-system overcrowding.16 Despite these advantages, the method is compromised by 3 considerations when applied to SARS-CoV-2 CODA, which should be quantified to inform future policy.

First, the method should distinguish natural from societal causes to account for possible consequences of policy decisions and fears that, although prompted by anticipated effects of SARS-CoV-2, were not direct or inevitable viral sequelae. Examples include suicides from stay-at-home order-related labor market contraction17 and social isolation,18 increases in domestic violence,19 overdoses due to interruptions in substance use disorder treatment,20 and delays in emergency care for life-threatening conditions21-23 in geographic areas where health-system overcrowding was expected but not realized.24,25 To promote evidence-based public health policy, population-level disease-mitigation strategies that go beyond traditional practices of isolating the sick and quarantining those exposed to disease merit empirical investigation.26,27

Second, the method should reflect the effects that financial incentives around hospital quality metrics (QM), which are commonly associated with provider coding practices, may have on CODA.28-30 For example, in United Kingdom hospitals, increases in coding for palliative-care admissions produced a severity-adjusted mortality-rate decline of 50% over the 5-year period ending in 2009, while the crude death rate remained unchanged.31 Although we are not aware of studies linking QMs to CODA, it is known that CODA errors are more likely to occur in hospitals than elsewhere,32 with an 85% error rate reported in comparisons of death certificates with autopsy findings at one regional academic institution.33 The potential effect of financial incentives on CODA is particularly important for SARS-CoV-2 because several competing CODs, including chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD), acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, pneumonia, and stroke, are included in Medicare 30-day mortality measures used to calculate prospective payment rates.34 All but one of these (CLRD) is included in Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality inpatient quality indicators.35 Sepsis and cancer, other competing causes of death, are also the target of QM.36-38 Although not affecting all-cause death counts, the incentive to substitute SARS-CoV-2 for another COD could affect the accuracy of the SARS-CoV-2-attributed count.

Third, the method should account for baseline life expectancies among those whose deaths were reported as caused by SARS-CoV-2. For example, at age 80 years, the 1-year probability of death is 5.8% for males and 4.3% for females, higher in those with cardiovascular comorbidities.39,40 In that age group, the population-level risk of a SARS-CoV-2 death in New York City, a pandemic epicenter, was 1.5% in about 3 pandemic months through June 17, 2020.41 Thus, deaths from competing CODs would be expected to decline late in the pandemic and in subsequent months. From a policy perspective, quantifying this effect is consistent with the quality-adjusted life year approach in evidence-based medicine, which considers future life expectancy in assessing the effects of disease and disease-mitigation interventions.42

To permit assessments of SARS-CoV-2-related mortality, publicly available NCHS data include weekly aggregated totals for all-cause deaths, natural-cause deaths, and selected categories of CODs, reported as final data for 2014-2018 and provisional data for 2019-2020.4 These data, which are updated weekly, have important limitations. First, International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 diagnosis codes are grouped into broad categories, rather than the individual ICD-10 codes available in full COD files (Appendix 1). Second, only 11 selected diagnostic categories are reported. Third, although 63% of deaths are reported within 10 days, reporting lags vary by state.4 Reporting delays for injurious deaths are greater because they require investigation (e.g., forensic toxicology).43 Pending investigation, these deaths are often assigned ICD-10 code R99, """"ill-defined and unknown cause of mortality.""""43

In this exploratory study, we used these files to provide preliminary evidence on the following: (1) change in CODA compared with historical experience; (2) association of CODA with QM; and (3) suitability of the files to distinguish policy-related from virus-related effects. All analyses were adjusted for population and reporting lags and based on comparisons of 2020 with equivalent weeks in the 5 most recent years. We hypothesized that if substitution of SARS-CoV-2 for alternative CODs occurred, death counts for competing diagnoses would decline relative to historical experience during the pandemic, especially after issuance of the NCHS death-certification guidance; these declines would be greater for QM than for other conditions; and they would accelerate late in the pandemic as earlier SARS-CoV-2 deaths offset later deaths from competing causes.","Fairman, K.

11099,Risk Factors for Mortality of COVID-19 Patients,"BackgroundLethality rates of COVID-19 are so different between countries and continents. This lethality seems to be very low in Africa and Asia, but exceedingly high in western Europe and North America. Many factors could have a role in this disparity such as comorbidities. Advanced age, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer were the most frequently cited in the reported COVID-19 data. The main objective was to analyze and evaluate the association between the COVID-19 mortality and the mentioned factors in 164 countries.

MethodsThe Data of COVID-19 deaths, latitude degrees, population age distribution, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes and cancer were extracted from different online sources. For the statistical analysis, we used Spearman to measure the correlation coefficient between numbers of deaths and the mentioned factors until June 29, 2020.

ResultsThe correlation between COVID-19 mortality and latitude, high age, obesity, CVD and number of cancer patients per 100,000 is significant at 0.01 level with r = 0.489, r=0.511, r=0.489, r=0.561 and r=0.536 respectively. The correlation between the number of deaths and diabetes is less strong than the previous ones, and the correlation coefficient is r= 0.154.

ConclusionThe great lethality of COVID-19 in western Europe and North America can be explained in part by the highest of age, cancer and CVD percentage in these regions. It seems also plausible that the increased obesity in the USA and vitamin D deficiency in Europe may contribute to increasing the number of COVID-19 deaths.","Ouchetto, O.; Drissi Bourhanbour, A.",2020-07-07,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.07.02.20145375,1,Ouail Ouchetto,Hassan II University - Casablanca,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20145375v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20145375v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1017/dmp.2021.7
17316,"Transmission of COVID-19 in 282 clusters in Catalonia, Spain: a cohort study","BackgroundThere remains limited data on what variables affect risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and developing symptomatic Covid-19 and in particular the relationship to viral load (VL). We analysed data from linked index cases and their contacts to explore factors associated with transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsPatients were recruited as part of a randomized control trial, conducted between March to April 2020, that aimed to assess if hydroxychloroquine reduced transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Non-hospitalised Covid-19 cases and their contacts were identified through the local surveillance system. VL, measured by quantitative PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab, was assessed at enrollment, at day 14, and whenever the participant reported Covid-19-like symptoms. Risk of transmission, developing symptomatic disease and incubation dynamics were evaluated using regression analysis.

FindingsWe identified 314 cases, 282 of which had at least one contact (753 contacts in total). Ninety (33%) of 282 clusters had at least one transmission event. The secondary attack rate was 16% (125/753), with a variation from 12% to 24% for VL of the index case of <106, and >109 copies/mL, respectively (OR per log10 increase in VL 1.3 95%CI 1.1-1.6). Increased risk of transmission was also associated with household contact (OR 2.7; 1.4-5.06) and age of the contact (OR 1.02 per year; 1.01-1.04). The proportion of PCR positive contacts who developed symptomatic Covid-19 was 40.3% (181/449), with a variation from 25% to 60% for VL of the contact <107, and >109 copies/mL (HR log10 increase in VL 1.12; 95% CI 1.05 - 1.2). Time to onset of symptomatic disease decreased from a median of 7 days (IQR 5-10) for individuals with an initial viral load <107 to 6 days (4-8) and 5 days (3-8) for individuals with an initial viral load of 107-109 and >109, respectively.

InterpretationViral load of index cases is a leading driver of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The risk of symptomatic Covid-19 is strongly associated with viral load of contacts at baseline and shortens the incubation time in a dose-dependent manner.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn September 2020, we searched PubMed database for articles reporting on factors influencing transmission and the risk of developing symptomatic disease. Search terms included """"Covid-19"""", """"SARS-CoV-2"""", """"transmission"""", """"incubation time"""", and """"risk"""", with no language restrictions. By 20th September, various authors had reported on retrospective analyses of clusters of index cases and their corresponding contacts, as well as series of patients who developed symptomatic Covid-19 disease after PCR positive result. Besides describing the secondary attack rate, various authors identified risk factors for transmission associated with the place and duration of exposure and the lack of use of personal protective equipment. A single study suggested that symptomatic individuals might be more likely to transmit than asymptomatic cases but we found no clear evidence regarding the influence of viral load of the index case on transmission risk. Similarly, although various retrospective series of patients with positive PCR results had reported incubation times elsewhere, the characteristics of index case and contacts that may influence the risk of developing symptomatic Covid-19 and the time to this event had been barely addressed.

Added value of this studyWe analyzed data from a large cluster-randomized clinical trial on post-exposure therapy for Covid-19 that provide new information on SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. Several design components add value to this dataset. Notably, quantitative PCR was available for the index cases to estimate risk of transmission. Furthermore, quantitative PCR was also performed on asymptomatic contacts at the time of enrollment allowing to investigate the dynamics of symptomatic disease onset among them. We found that the viral load of the index case was the leading determinant of the risk of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity among contacts. Among contacts who were SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive at baseline, viral load significantly influenced the risk of developing the symptomatic disease in a dose-dependent manner. This influence also became apparent in the incubation time, which shortened with increasing baseline viral loads.

Implication of all the available evidenceOur results provide important insights into the knowledge regarding the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and Covid-19 development. The fact that the transmission risk is primarily driven by the viral load of index cases, more than other factors such as their symptoms or age, suggests that all cases should be considered potential transmitters irrespective of their presentation and encourages assessing viral load in cases with a larger number of close contacts. Similarly, our results regarding the risk and expected time to developing symptomatic Covid-19 encourage risk stratification of newly diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections based on the initial viral load.","Marks, M.; Millat, P.; Ouchi, D.; Roberts, C.

8558,Non-pharmaceutical behavioural measures for droplet-borne biological hazards prevention: Health-EDRM for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic,"IntroductionNon-pharmaceutical interventions to facilitate response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a disease caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, are urgently needed. Using the WHO health emergency and disaster risk management (health-EDRM) framework, behavioural measures for droplet-borne communicable disease, with their enabling and limiting factors at various implementation levels were evaluated.

Sources of dataKeyword search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Medline, Science Direct, WHO and CDC online publication database. Using OCEBM as review criteria, 105 English-language articles, with ten bottom-up, non-pharmaceutical prevention measures, published between January 2000 and May 2020 were identified and examined.

Areas of AgreementEvidence-guided behavioural measures against COVID-19 transmission for global at-risk communities are identified.

Area of ConcernStrong evidence-based systematic behavioural studies for COVID-19 prevention are lacking.

Growing pointsVery limited research publications are available for non-pharmaceutical interventions to facilitate pandemic response.

7833,Association between comorbidities and the risk of death in patients with COVID-19: sex-specific differences,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) spreads rapidly around the world.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the association between comorbidities and the risk of death in patients with COVID-19, and to further explore potential sex-specific differences.

MethodsWe analyzed the data from 18,465 laboratory-confirmed cases that completed an epidemiological investigation in Hubei Province as of February 27, 2020. Information on death was obtained from the Infectious Disease Information System. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the association between comorbidities and the risk of death in patients with COVID-19.

ResultsThe median age for COVID-19 patients was 50.5 years. 8828(47.81%) patients were females. Severe cases accounted for 20.11% of the study population. As of March 7, 2020, a total of 919 cases deceased from COVID-19 for a fatality rate of 4.98%. Hypertension (13.87%), diabetes (5.53%), and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (CBVDs) (4.45%) were the most prevalent comorbidities, and 27.37% of patients with COVID-19 reported having at least one comorbidity. After adjustment for age, gender, address, and clinical severity, patients with hypertension (HR 1.55, 95%CI 1.35-1.78), diabetes (HR 1.35, 95%CI 1.13-1.62), CBVDs (HR 1.70, 95%CI 1.43-2.02), chronic kidney diseases (HR 2.09, 95%CI 1.47-2.98), and at least two comorbidities (HR 1.84, 95%CI 1.55-2.18) had significant increased risks of death. And the association between diabetes and the risk of death from COVID-19 was prominent in women (HR 1.69, 95%CI 1.27-2.25) than in men (HR 1.16, 95%CI 0.91-1.46) (P for interaction = 0.036).

ConclusionAmong laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hubei province, China, patients with hypertension, diabetes, CBVDs, chronic kidney diseases were significantly associated with increased risk of death. The association between diabetes and the risk of death tended to be stronger in women than in men. Clinicians should increase their awareness of the increased risk of death in COVID-19 patients with comorbidities.","Wu, M.; Huang, S.; Liu, J.; Shu, Y.; Luo, Y.; Wang, L.; Li, M.; Wang, Y.",2020-05-25,Respiratory Medicine,10.1101/2020.05.22.20109579,1,Youjie Wang,"Department of Maternal and Child Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.20109579v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.20109579v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
15582,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fourteen wastewater treatment systems in Uttarakhand and Rajasthan States of North India,"We investigated the presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA at different treatment stages of 15 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in two North Indian states of Rajasthan and Uttarakhand. Untreated (influent), biologically treated, and disinfected wastewater samples were collected from May to August 2020. The qualitative analysis of the wastewater for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was done using different pre-processing methods. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 11 out of 39 wastewater samples in Jaipur district and 5 out of 17 wastewater samples in Haridwar District using Reverse-Transcriptase Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) for qualitative detection. None of the 56 samples tested for post-secondary or tertiary treatment were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The findings indicate that there are no SARS-CoV-2 related risks involved with using the treated effluent for non-potable applications. In contrast, untreated wastewater may be a potential route of viral transmission to the WWTP and sanitation workers. Future studies are imperative to understand the survival rates of these viruses in wastewater.","Arora, S.; Nag, A.; Rajpal, A.; Tiwari, S.

4852,Review of Current Evidence of Hydroxychloroquine in Pharmacotherapy of COVID-19,"ImportanceThe COVID-19 Pandemic has literally left the world breathless in the chase for pharmacotherapy. With vaccine and novel drug development in early clinical trials, repurposing of existing drugs takes the center stage.

ObjectiveA potential drug discussed in global scientific community is hydroxychloroquine. We intend to systematically explore, analyze, rate the existing evidence of hydroxychloroquine in the light of published, unpublished and clinical trial data.

Evidence reviewPubMed Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google scholar databases, pre-proof article repositories, clinical trial registries were comprehensively searched with focused question of use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients. The literature was systematically explored as per PRISMA guidelines.

FindingsTotal 156 articles were available as of 7th May 2020; of which 11 articles of relevance were analyzed. Three in-vitro studies were reviewed. Two open label non-randomized trials, two open label randomized control trials, one large observational study, one follow-up study and two retrospective cohort studies were systematically analyzed and rated by oxford CEBM and GRADE framework for quality and strength of evidence. Also 27 clinical trials registered in three clinical trial registries were analyzed and summarized. Hydroxychloroquine seems to be efficient in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in in-vitro cell lines. However, there is lack of strong evidence from human studies. It was found that overall quality of available evidence ranges from  very low to  low.

Conclusions and relevanceThe in-vitro cell culture based data of viral inhibition does not suffice for the use of hydroxychloroquine in the patients with COVID-19. Current literature shows inadequate, low level evidence in human studies. Scarcity of safety and efficacy data warrants medical communities, health care agencies and governments across the world against the widespread use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 prophylaxis and treatment, until robust evidence becomes available.

KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the current evidence for use of Hydroxychloroquine in pharmacotherapy of COVID-19?

FindingsWe electronically explored various databases and clinical trial registries and identified 11 publications and 27 clinical trials with active recruitment. The in-vitro study data demonstrates the viral inhibition by hydroxychloroquine. The clinical studies are weakly designed and conducted with insufficient reporting and significant limitations. Well designed robust clinical trials are being conducted all over the world and results of few such robust studies are expected shortly.

MeaningCurrent evidence stands inadequate to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in pharmacotherapy of COVID-19.","Suranagi, U. D.; Rehan, H.

Overall, 879 students were randomly sampled and participated in this study. In an online survey, the randomly sampled participants nominated a friend, and reported their own and their nominated friends COVID-19 status. Nominated friends were about 1.64 (95% CI: 1.33, 2.00) times more likely to have ever been infected with COVID-19, compared to randomly sampled students. Our study corroborates the effectiveness of acquaintance sampling for identifying members of networks with higher COVID-19 risk.

21205,Effects of Diabetes and Blood Glucose on COVID-19 Mortality: A Retrospective Observational Study,"OBJECTIVETo investigate the association of diabetes and blood glucose on mortality of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSThis was a retrospective observational study of all patients with COVID-19 admitted to Huo-Shen-Shan Hospital, Wuhan, China. The hospital was built only for treating COVID-19 and opened on February 5, 2020. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality during hospitalization.

RESULTSAmong 2877 hospitalized patients, 13.5% (387/2877) had a history of diabetes and 1.9% (56/2877) died in hospital. After adjustment for confounders, patients with diabetes had a 2-fold increase in the hazard of mortality as compared to patients without diabetes (adjusted HR 2.11, 95%CI: 1.16-3.83, P=0.014). The on-admission glucose (per mmol/L[&ge;]4mmol/L) was significantly associated with subsequent mortality on COVID-19 (adjusted HR 1.17, 95%CI: 1.10-1.24, P<0.001).

CONCLUSIONSDiabetes and on-admission glucose (per mmol/L[&ge;]4mmol/L) are associated with increased mortality in patients with COVID-19. These data support that blood glucose should be properly controlled for possibly better survival outcome in patients with COVID-19.","Li, F.; Cai, Y.; Gao, C.; Zhou, L.; Chen, R.; Zhang, K.; Li, W.; Zhang, R.; Zhang, X.; Wang, D.; Liu, Y.; Tao, L.",2021-01-22,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.01.21.20202119,1,Ling Tao,"Department of Cardiology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.21.20202119v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.21.20202119v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
19867,Error Rates in SARS-CoV-2 Testing Examined with Bayesian Inference,"A literature review on SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used to construct a clinical test confusion matrix. A simple correction method for bulk test results is then demonstrated with examples. The required sensitivity and specificity of a test are explored for societal needs and use cases, before a sequential analysis of common example scenarios is explored. The analysis suggests that many of the people with mild symptoms and positive test results are unlikely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in some regions. It is concluded that current and foreseen alternative tests can not be used to """"clear"""" people as being non-infected. Recommendations are given that regional authorities must establish a programme to monitor operational test characteristics before launching large scale testing; and that large scale testing for tracing infection networks in some regions is not viable, but may be possible in a focused way that does not exceed the working capacity of the laboratories staffed by competent experts. RT-PCR tests can not be solely relied upon as the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis at scale, instead clinical assessment supported by a range of expert diagnostic tests should be used.","Bentley, P.

17446,Retrospective in silico HLA predictions from COVID-19 patients reveal alleles associated with disease prognosis,"BackgroundThe Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) gene locus plays a fundamental role in human immunity, and it is established that certain HLA alleles are disease determinants.

MethodsBy combining the predictive power of multiple in silico HLA predictors, we have previously identified prevalent HLA class I and class II alleles, including DPA1*02:02, in two small cohorts at the COVID-19 pandemic onset. Since then, newer and larger patient cohorts with controls and associated demographic and clinical data have been deposited in public repositories. Here, we report on HLA-I and HLA-II alleles, along with their associated risk significance in one such cohort of 126 patients, including COVID-19 positive (n=100) and negative patients (n=26).

ResultsWe recapitulate an enrichment of DPA1*02:02 in the COVID-19 positive cohort (29%) when compared to the COVID-negative control group (Fishers exact test [FET] p=0.0174). Having this allele, however, does not appear to put this cohorts patients at an increased risk of hospitalization. Inspection of COVID-19 disease severity outcomes reveal nominally significant risk associations with A*11:01 (FET p=0.0078), C*04:01 (FET p=0.0087) and DQA1*01:02 (FET p=0.0121).

ConclusionsWhile enrichment of these alleles falls below statistical significance after Bonferroni correction, COVID-19 patients with the latter three alleles tend to fare worse overall. This is especially evident for patients with C*04:01, where disease prognosis measured by mechanical ventilation-free days was statistically significant after multiple hypothesis correction (Bonferroni p = 0.0023), and may hold potential clinical value.","Warren, R.

Data sourcesWe searched PUMBED. Medline, Embase, MedRxiv and bioRxiv databases upto 3rd May 2020 utilizing combinations of word variants for """"coronavirus"""" or """"COVID-19"""" or """"severe acute respiratory syndrome"""" or """"SARS-COV-2"""" and """"pregnancy"""". We also included data from preprint articles.

Study eligibility criteriaOriginal case reports and case series on pregnant women with diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Study appraisal and synthesis methodsWe included 50 studies reporting the information on 441 pregnant women and 391 neonates. The primary outcome measures were maternal health characteristics and adverse pregnancy outcomes, neonatal outcomes and SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates was extracted. Treatments given to pregnant women with COVID-19 were also recorded.

ResultsOut of 441 women affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, 387 women have delivered. There are nine maternal deaths reported. In pregnant women with COVID-19, the most common symptoms were fever (56%), cough (43%), myalgia (19%), dyspnea (18%) and diarrhea (6%). Pneumonia was diagnosed by CT scan imaging in 96 % of COVID-19 pregnant women. Pregnancy complications included delivery by cesarean section (80%), preterm labor (26%), fetal distress (8%) and premature rupture of membranes (9%). Six still births (2%) are reported. The most common co-morbidities associated with pregnant women with COVID-19 were hypertensive disorders (10%), diabetes (9%), placental disorders (2%), co-infections (3%), scarred uterus (3%) and hypothyroidism (3%). Amongst the neonates of COVID-19 mothers, preterm birth (25%), respiratory distress syndrome (8%), pneumonia (8%) were reported. There were four neonatal deaths reported. Vertical transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 8%.

ConclusionIn pregnant women with COVID-19, hypertensive disorders and diabetes are common comorbidities and there is a risk of preterm delivery and maternal death. Amongst the neonates born to mothers with COVID-19, respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia are common occurrence. There are reports of still births and neonatal deaths.

18852,Automated Western immunoblotting detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies.,"ELISA and chemiluminescence serological assays for COVID-19 are currently incorporating only one or two SARS-CoV-2 antigens. We developed an automated Western immunoblotting as a complementary serologic assay for COVID-19. The Jess Simple Western system, an automated capillary-based assay was used, incorporating an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 lineage 20a strain as antigen, and IgT detection. In total, 602 sera were tested including 223 from RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, 76 from patients diagnosed with seasonal HCoVs and 303 from coronavirus-negative control sera. We also compared this assay with the EUROIMMUN(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA kit. Among 223 sera obtained from RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, 180/223 (81%) exhibited reactivity against the nucleocapsid and 70/223 (31%) against the spike protein. Nucleocapsid reactivity was further detected in 9/76 (14%) samples collected from patients diagnosed with seasonal HCoVs and in 15/303 (5%) coronavirus-negative control samples. In the subset of sera collected more than 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms, the sensitivity was 94% and the specificity 93%, the latter value probably reflecting cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses. The automated Western immunoblotting presented a substantial agreement (90%) with the compared ELISA (Cohens Kappa=0.64). Automated Western immunoblotting may be used as a second line test to monitor exposition of people to HCoVs including SARS-CoV-2.","Edouard, S.; Jaafar, R.; Orain, N.; Parola, P.; Colson, P.; La Scola, B.; Fournier, P.-E.; Raoult, D.; Drancourt, M.",2020-11-30,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.11.26.20238733,1,Michel Drancourt,Aix Marseille Université,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.26.20238733v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.26.20238733v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
11876,Is population anxiety associated with COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths? A study protocol.,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBACKGROUNDC_ST_ABSThe nocebo effect is any harmful reaction following a negative suggestion. Anxiety can be seen as a manifestation of a nocebo context. The psychological stress of the COVID-19 pandemic led some people to experience COVID-19 symptoms, which were not actually related to a COVID-19 infection. A fundamental goal during the COVID-19 pandemic is to limit the COVID-19 related demand on healthcare systems and to minimize COVID-19 related deaths. This exploratory study aims to determine to what extent the anxiety in the population is related to the number of covid-19 related hospitalizations and deaths.

METHODSWe will quantify the magnitude of the relationship between population anxiety and hospitalizations / deaths. Anxiety will be assessed using the results of the most frequently used anxiety measuring scale. Official websites of governments will be screened to determine hospitalizations and deaths.

Studies will be included if they had at least 100 respondents, used a validated anxiety scale, reported on the general population of a country, and were conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic. A search strategy will take into account the limited resources for this study and will be used to search Pubmed, MedRXiv and PsychRXiv. Screening will take place at two levels: abstracts and titles, followed by full text reports. One researcher will extract data which will be double checked by a second researcher.

We will perform weighted OLS regression to quantify the relationship of anxiety and covid-19 related hospitalizations / deaths.

DISCUSSIONCovid-19 related measures can carry a significant social cost and risk of unwanted effects; it is therefore important to assess the extent to which anxiety in the population is related to covid-19 related hospitalizations or deaths. If anxiety can be properly reduced in the population, health care will be safeguarded. Thus, any strategy that reduces anxiety can then be included in evidence-based decision making.","Feys, F.; Naser, A.",2020-07-18,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.07.16.20155457,1,Frederik Feys,Independent,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155457v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155457v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

Methods and FindingsElectronic searches were performed for reports through May 1 2020 and reports on COVID-19 ICU admissions and outcomes were included using predefined search terms. Relevant data was subsequently extracted and pooled using fixed or random effects meta-analysis depending on heterogeneity. Study quality was assessed by the NIH tool and heterogeneity was assessed by I2 and Q tests. Baseline patient characteristics, ICU and IMV outcomes were pooled and meta-analyzed. Pooled odds ratios (pOR) were calculated for clinical features against ICU, IMV mortality. Subgroup analysis was carried out based on patient regions. A total of twenty-eight studies comprising 12,437 COVID-19 ICU admissions from seven countries were meta-analyzed. Pooled ICU admission rate was 21% [95% CI 0.12-0.34] and 69% of cases needed IMV [95% CI 0.61-0.75]. ICU and IMV mortality were 28.3% [95% CI 0.25-0.32], 43% [95% CI 0.29-0.58] and ICU, IMV duration was 7.78 [95% CI 6.99-8.63] and 10.12 [95% CI 7.08-13.16] days respectively. Besides confirming the significance of comorbidities and clinical findings of COVID-19 previously reported, we found the major correlates with ICU mortality were IMV [pOR 16.46, 95% CI 4.37-61.96], acute kidney injury (AKI) [pOR 12.47, 95% CI 1.52-102.7], and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [pOR 6.52, 95% CI 2.66-16.01]. Subgroup analyses confirm significant regional discrepancies in outcomes.

ConclusionsThis is the most comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of COVID-19 ICU and IMV cases and associated outcomes to date and the only analysis to implicate IMVs associtaion with COVID-19 ICU mortality. The significant association of AKI, ARDS and IMV with mortality has implications for ICU resource planning for AKI and ARDS as well as research into optimal ventilation strategies for patients. Regional differences in outcome implies a need to develop region specific protocols for ventilatory support as well as overall treatment.","Chang, R.; Elhusseiny, K.

14286,A Comparison of Covid-19 Patient Characteristics Before versus After Partial Lockdown in Vietnam,"BackgroundGiven the Covid-19 sudden rapid spread in the community since 25 July 2020, an updated analysis of Covid-19 cases was conducted to examine the differences of characteristics of Covid-19 patients before versus after partial lockdown end in Vietnam.

MethodsData of 569 Covid-19 patients confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 23 January to 31 July was collected from available official databases. We divided Covid-19 situation timeline into two main periods, before lockdown end (23 January - 22 April) and after lockdown end (23 April - 31 July).

ResultsWe found significant variations in the distribution of Covid-19 patients among different provinces between two periods. Covid-19 confirmed patients were older in the time after lockdown end compared to in the period before lockdown end by a median of 5 years. All discharged Covid-19 patients and no Covid-19 death were in the phase before lockdown, while post lockdown period had still remained significant patients being under treatment, especially reported first fatalities. The number of Covid-19 patients who returned from other countries (excluding China) slightly increased through two stages (p >0.05), partially showing that the continuous volume of people returning Vietnam from abroad during the Covid-19 epidemic.

ConclusionsOur analysis indicated demographic and epidemiological disparity of Covid-19 patients before versus after loosening the national partial lockdown in Vietnam. It is important to suggest that, proactive efforts in Covid-19 control after partial lockdown end will be effective when the measures to closely control and monitor repatriation and immigration via the borders of Vietnam are strictly enforced.

2338,68 Consecutive patients assessed for COVID-19 infection; experience from a UK regional infectious disease unit,"Clinical assessment of possible infection with SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the outbreak of COVID-19 respiratory illness, has been a major activity of infectious diseases services in the UK and elsewhere since the first report of cases in December 2019. We report our case series of 68 patients, reviewed by Infectious Diseases Consultants at a Regional Infectious Diseases Unit in the UK. We prospectively evaluated our service between the 29th Jan 2020 and 24th Feb 2020.

Demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected. We have compared clinical features and subsequent diagnosis between well patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment.

Final microbiological diagnoses included SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), Mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza A, RSV, non SARS/MERS coronaviruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus. 9/68 were treated with antimicrobials, 15/68 were admitted to a negative pressure room of whom 5/68 were admitted solely due to an inability to isolate at home. Patients requiring either admission on clinical grounds or antimicrobials (14/68) were similar to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials, with modestly more fever and shortness of breath in the clinically admitted / antimicrobial group. The most commonly prescribed antimicrobials were doxycycline, moxifloxacin and oseltamivir.

The majority of patients had mild illness which did not require a clinical intervention to manage. This finding supports a community testing approach supported by clinicians to review the proportion of more unwell patients.","Easom, N.; Moss, P.; Barlow, G.; Samson, A.; Taynton, T.; Adams, K.; Ivan, M.; Burns, P.; Gajee, K.; Eastick, K.; Lillie, P.",2020-03-06,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.02.29.20029462,1,Patrick Lillie,"Department of Infection, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Hull, East Yorkshire, United Kingdom",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029462v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029462v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1111/irv.12739
14926,On the reliability of predictions on Covid-19 dynamics: a systematic and critical review of modelling techniques,"Since the beginning of the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV disease (Covid-19) in December 2019, there has been an exponential number of studies using diverse modelling techniques to assess the dynamics of transmission of the disease, predict its future course and determine the impact of different control measures. In this study, we conducted a global systematic literature review to summarize trends in the modelling techniques used for Covid-19 from January 1st 2020 to June 30th 2020. We further examined the reliability and correctness of predictions by comparing predicted and observed values for cumulative cases and deaths. From an initial 2170 peer-reviewed articles and preprints found with our defined keywords, 148 were fully analyzed. We found that most studies on the modelling of Covid-19 were from Asia (52.70%) and Europe (25%). Most of them used compartmental models (SIR and SEIR) (57%) and statistical models (growth models and time series) (28%) while few used artificial intelligence (5%) and Bayesian approach (3%). For cumulative cases, the ratio predicted/observed values and the ratio of the amplitude of confidence interval (CI) or credibility interval (CrI) of predictions and the central value were on average larger than 1 (4.49 {+/-} 9.98 and 1.10 {+/-} 1.94, respectively) indicating cases of incorrect predictions, large uncertainty on predictions, and large variation across studies. There was no clear difference among models used for these two ratios. However, the ratio predicted/observed values was relatively smaller for SIR models than for SEIR models, indicating that more complex models might not be more accurate for predictions. We further found that values of both ratios decreased with the number of days covered by studies, indicating that the wider the time covered by the data, the higher the correctness and accuracy of predictions. In 21.62% of studies, observed values fall within the CI or CrI of the cumulative cases predicted by studies. Only six of the 148 selected studies (4.05%) predicted the number of deaths. For 33.3% of these predictions, the ratio of predicted to actual number of deaths was close to 1. We also found that the Bayesian model made predictions closer to reality than the compartmental and the statistical models, although these differences are only suggestive due to the small size of the data. Our findings suggest that while predictions made by the different models are useful to understand the pandemic course and guide policy-making, there should be cautious in their usage.","Gnanvi, J.

2909,A model for COVID-19 prediction in Iran based on China parameters,"BackgroundThe rapid spread of COVID-19 virus from China to other countries and outbreaks of disease require an epidemiological analysis of the disease in the shortest time and an increased awareness of effective interventions. The purpose of this study was to estimate the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran based on the SIR model. The results of the analysis of the epidemiological data of Iran from January 22 to March 8, 2020 were investigated and the prediction was made until March 29, 2020.

MethodsBy estimating the three parameters of time-dependent transmission rate, time-dependent recovery rate, and time-dependent mortality rate from Covid-19 outbreak in China, and using the number of Covid-19 infections in Iran, we predicted the number of patients for the next month in Iran. Each of these parameters was estimated using GAM models. All analyses were conducted in R software using the mgcv package.

FindingsOn average, 925 people with COVID-19 are expected to be infected daily in Iran. The epidemic peaks within one week (15.03.2020 to 03.21.2020) and reaches its highest point on 03.18.2020 with 1126 infected cases.

ConclusionThe most important point is to emphasize the timing of the epidemic peak, hospital readiness, government measures and public readiness to reduce social contact.","Zareie, B.; Roshani, A.; Mansournia, M.

6127,Neutrophil extracellular traps and thrombosis in COVID-19,"BackgroundEarly studies of patients with COVID-19 have demonstrated markedly dysregulated coagulation and a high risk of morbid arterial and venous thrombotic events. While elevated levels of blood neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been described in patients with COVID-19, their potential role in COVID-19-associated thrombosis remains unknown.

ObjectivesTo elucidate the potential role of hyperactive neutrophils and NET release in COVID-19-associated thrombosis.

Patients/MethodsThis is a retrospective, case-control study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who developed thrombosis (n=11), as compared with gender- and age-matched COVID-19 patients without clinical thrombosis (n=33). In addition to capturing clinical data, we measured remnants of NETs (cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, and citrullinated histone H3) and neutrophil-derived S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) in patient sera.

ResultsThe majority of patients (9/11) were receiving at least prophylactic doses of heparinoids at the time thrombosis was diagnosed. As compared with controls, patients with COVID-19-associated thrombosis had significantly higher blood levels of markers of NETs (cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, citrullinated histone H3) and neutrophil activation (calprotectin). The thrombosis group also had higher levels of D-dimer, CRP, ferritin, and platelets, but not troponin or neutrophils. Finally, there were strong associations between markers of hyperactive neutrophils (calprotectin and cell-free DNA) and D-dimer.

ConclusionElevated levels of neutrophil activation and NET formation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are associated with higher risk of morbid thrombotic complications. These observations underscore the need for urgent investigation into the potential relationship between NETs and unrelenting thrombosis in COVID-19.

9683,"COVID-19 Spread in India: Dynamics, Modeling, and Future Projections","AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCOVID-19 is an extremely infectious disease with a relatively large virus incubation period in the affected people who may be asymptomatic. Therefore, to reduce the transmission of this pathogen, several countries have taken many intervention measures. In this paper, we show that the impact of these measures in India is different from several other countries. It is shown that an early lockdown in late March 2020 changed the initial exponential growth curve of COVID-19 to a linear one, but a surge in the number of cases from late April 2020 brought India back to a quadratic trajectory. A regional analysis shows the disparate impact of the intervention in different states. It is further shown that the number of reported infections correlates with the number of tests, and therefore regions with limited diagnostics resources may not have a realistic estimate of the virus spread. This insufficiency of diagnostic test data is also reflected in an increasing positivity rate for India nearly 2.5 months after the lockdown, inconsistent with the trends observed for other geographical regions. Nonetheless, future projections are made using different epidemiological models based on the available data, and a comparative study is presented. In the absence of a reliable estimate of the true number of infections, these projections will have a limited accuracy: with that limitation, the most optimistic prediction suggests a continuing virus transmission through September 2020.","Ranjan, R.",2020-06-14,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.12.20129197,1,Rajesh Ranjan,The Ohio State University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.20129197v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.20129197v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA

17357,Optimal COVID-19 quarantine and testing strategies,"As economic woes of the COVID-19 pandemic deepen, strategies are being formulated to avoid the need for prolonged stay-at-home orders, while implementing risk-based quarantine, testing, contact tracing and surveillance protocols. Given limited resources and the significant economic, public health, and operational challenges of the current 14-day quarantine recommendation, it is vital to understand if shorter but equally effective quarantine and testing strategies can be deployed. To quantify the probability of post-quarantine transmission upon isolation of a positive test, we developed a mathematical model in which we varied quarantine duration and the timing of molecular tests for three scenarios of entry into quarantine. Specifically, we consider travel quarantine, quarantine of traced contacts with an unknown time if infection, and quarantine of cases with a known time of exposure. With a one-day delay between test and result, we found that testing on exit (or entry and exit) can reduce the duration of a 14-day quarantine by 50%, while testing on entry shortened quarantine by at most one day. Testing on exit more effectively reduces post-quarantine transmission than testing upon entry. Furthermore, we identified the optimal testing date within quarantines of varying duration, finding that testing on exit was most effective for quarantines lasting up to seven days. As a real-world validation of these principles, we analyzed the results of 4,040 SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR tests administered to offshore oil rig employees. Among the 47 positives obtained with a testing on entry and exit strategy, 16 cases that previously tested negative at entry were identified, with no further cases detected among employees following quarantine exit. Moreover, this strategy successfully prevented an expected nine offshore transmission events stemming from cases who had tested negative on the entry test, each one a serious concern for initiating rapid spread and a disabling outbreak in the close quarters of an offshore rig. This successful outcome highlights that appropriately timed testing can make shorter quarantines more effective, thereby minimizing economic impacts, disruptions to operational integrity, and COVID-related public health risks.","Wells, C.

22261,Learning Where to Look for COVID-19 Growth: Multivariate Analysis of COVID-19 Cases Over Time using Explainable Convolution-LSTM,"Determinant factors which contribute to the prediction should take into account multivariate analysis for capturing coarse-to-fine contextual information. From the preliminary descriptive analysis, it shows that environmental factor such as UV (ultraviolet) is one of the essential factors that should be considered to observe the COVID-19 epidemic drivers, During summer, UV can inactivate viruses that live in the air and on the surface of the objects especially at noon in tropical or subtropical countries. However, it may not be significant in closed spaces like workspace and areas with the intensive human-to-human transmission, especially in densely populated areas. Different COVID-19 pandemic growth patterns in northern subtropical, southern subtropical and tropical countries occur over time. Moreover, there are education, government, morphological, health, economic, and behavioral factors contributing to the growth of COVID-19. Multivariate analysis via visual attribution of explainable Convolution-LSTM is utilized to see high contributing factors responsible for the growth of daily COVID-19 cases.

21550,COVID-19 mortality: positive correlation with cloudiness and sunlight but no correlation with latitude in Europe,"We systematically investigated an ongoing debate about the possible correlation between SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) epidemiological outcomes and solar exposure in European countries, in the period of March - August 2020. For each country, we correlated its mortality data with solar insolation (watt/square metre) and objective sky cloudiness (as cloud fraction) derived from satellite weather data. We found a positive correlation between the monthly mortality rate and the overall cloudiness in that month (Pearsons r(35)=.779, P<.001; linear model fitting the data, adjusted R2 =0.59). In Europe, in colder months, approximately 34% to 58% of the variance in COVID-19 mortality/million appears to be predicted by the cloudiness fraction of the sky, except in August in which only [~]15% of the variance was explained. The data show a low, negative correlation between the mortality rate with the overall insolation received by the country area in that entire month (Pearsons r(35)=-0.622, P<.001). Additionally, we did not find any statistically significant correlation between the mortality and the latitude of the countries when the """"latitude of a country"""" was precisely defined as the average landmass location (country centroid). The unexpected correlation found between cloudiness and mortality could perhaps be explained by the following: 1) heavy cloudiness is linked with colder outdoor surfaces, which might aid virus survival; 2) reduced evaporation rate; 3) moderate pollution may be linked to both cloudiness and mortality; and 4) large-scale behavioural changes due to cloudiness (which perhaps drives people to spend more time indoors and thus facilitates indoor contamination).","Omer, S.; Iftime, A.; Burcea, V.

17954,Mathematical modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Qatar and its impact on the national response to COVID-19,"BackgroundMathematical modeling constitutes an important tool for planning robust responses to epidemics. This study was conducted to guide the Qatari national response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic. The study investigated the time course of the epidemic, forecasted healthcare needs, predicted the impact of social and physical distancing restrictions, and rationalized and justified easing of restrictions.

MethodsAn age-structured deterministic model was constructed to describe SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and disease progression throughout the population.

ResultsThe enforced social and physical distancing interventions flattened the epidemic curve, reducing the peaks for incidence, prevalence, acute-care hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalizations by 87%, 86%, 76%, and 78%, respectively. The daily number of new infections was predicted to peak at 12,750 on May 23, and active-infection prevalence was predicted to peak at 3.2% on May 25. Daily acute-care and ICU-care hospital admissions and occupancy were forecast accurately and precisely. By October 15, 2020, the basic reproduction number R0 had varied between 1.07-2.78, and 50.8% of the population were estimated to have been infected (1.43 million infections). The proportion of actual infections diagnosed was estimated at 11.6%. Applying the concept of Rt tuning, gradual easing of restrictions was rationalized and justified to start on June 15, 2020, when Rt declined to 0.7, to buffer the increased interpersonal contact with easing of restrictions and to minimize the risk of a second wave. No second wave has materialized as of October 15, 2020, five months after the epidemic peak.

ConclusionsUse of modeling and forecasting to guide the national response proved to be a successful strategy, reducing the toll of the epidemic to a manageable level for the healthcare system.","Ayoub, H.

Diagnostic accuracy of antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) in pre-/asymptomatic close contacts was up till now unknown.

MethodsWe performed a prospective cross-sectional diagnostic test accuracy study. Close contacts (e.g. selected via the test-and-trace program or contact tracing app) aged [&ge;]16 years and asymptomatic when requesting a test, were included consecutively and tested at day 5 at four Dutch public health service test sites. We evaluated two Ag-RDTs (BD Veritor System Ag-RDT (BD), and Roche/SD Biosensor Ag-RDT (SD-B)) with RT-PCR as the reference standard. Virus culture was performed in RT-PCR positive individuals to determine the viral load cut-off above which 95% was culture positive, as a proxy of infectiousness.

ResultsOf 2,678 BD-tested individuals, 233 (8.7%) were RT-PCR positive and BD detected 149 (sensitivity 63.9%; 95% confidence interval 57.4%-70.1%). Out of 1,596 SD-B-tested individuals, 132 (8.3%) were RT-PCR positive and SD-B detected 83 (sensitivity 62.9%; 54.0%-71.1%). When applying an infectiousness viral load cut-off [&ge;] 5.2 log10 gene copies/mL, the sensitivity was 90.1% (84.2%-94.4%) for BD, 86.8% (78.1% to 93.0%) for SD-B overall, and 88.1% (80.5%-93.5%) for BD, 85.1% (74.3%-92.6%) for SD-B for those still asymptomatic at the actual time of sampling. Specificity was >99% for both Ag-RDTs in all analyses.

ConclusionsThe sensitivity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 of both Ag-RDTs in pre-/asymptomatic close contacts is over 60%, increasing to over 85% after applying an infectiousness viral load cut-off.

10334,A model of COVID-19 transmission and control on university campuses,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, institutions of higher education in almost every nation closed in the first half of 2020. University administrators are now facing decisions about if and how to safely return students, staff and faculty to campus. To provide a framework to evaluate various strategies, we developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) type deterministic compartmental transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 among students, staff and faculty. Our goals were to support the immediate pandemic planning at our own university, and to provide a flexible modeling framework to inform the planning efforts at similar academic institutions. We parameterized the model for our institution, Emory University, a medium-size private university in Atlanta, Georgia. Control strategies of isolation and quarantine are initiated by screening (regardless of symptoms) or testing (of symptomatic individuals). We explore a range of screening and testing frequencies and perform a probabilistic sensitivity analysis of input parameters. We find that monthly and weekly screening can reduce cumulative incidence by 30% and 81% in students, respectively, while testing with a 2-, 4- and 7-day delay results in an 92%, 85% and 73% reduction in cumulative incidence in students over the semester, respectively. Smaller reductions are observed among staff and faculty. A testing strategy requires far fewer diagnostic assays to be implemented than a screening assay. Our intervention model is conservative in that we assume a fairly high reproductive number. We find that community-introduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection onto campus may be controlled with effective testing, isolation, contract tracing and quarantine, but that cases, hospitalization, and (in some scenarios) deaths may still occur. In addition to estimating health impacts, this model can help to predict the resource requirements in terms of diagnostic capacity and isolation/quarantine facilities associated with different strategies.","Lopman, B.; Liu, C.; Le Guillou, A.; Handel, A.; Lash, T.

14475,Examination of Isolation Rate in SIQR model for COVID-19 Epidemic,"Newly proposed SIQR model defines exponent{lambda} of exponential function expressing daily number of isolated persons as linear equation of isolation rate q and social distancing ratio x. In order to dynamically analyze the process of COVID-19 epidemic in seven countries by means of regression analyses of{lambda} , increasing rate of cumulative isolated persons(cases), IRCC, is proposed as practical index for the isolation rate q. IRCC is correlated with q in the form of q=C {middle dot} IRCC, where C is a normalizing coefficient. At first, C is formulated in two modes, one is simple and the other complex, under the constraint conditions by definition 0[&le;]x, q[&le;]1, which give allowable narrow path of C between upper and lower boundaries. Then, the dynamic locus of q-x relation is analyzed for each of seven countries including Japan and the United States using formulated isolation rate q, and characteristic q-x behavior for each country is derived. At the same time, it is shown that specific path selection of C gives almost same linear loci of q-x relation derived by mathematical sequential method imitating a bipedal walk. In addition, increasing rates of cumulative PCR tests, IRCT, for six countries are discussed in relation with IRCC, and are shown that IRCT contributes to the promotion of the isolation rate via IRCC.","Hashiguchi, K.",2020-09-03,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.09.01.20185611,1,Koichi Hashiguchi,None,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20185611v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20185611v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
5276,Forecast and interpretation of daily affected people during 21 days lockdown due to COVID 19 pandemic in India,"The problem of facing difficulty to control the spreading of newly detected novel corona virus 2019 is a matter of attention throughout the whole world. The total numbers of infected individuals have already crossed 2 million throughout the world. The government of all the affected countries have already taken many measures like lockdown to stop the spread. Therefore, it is important to study the nature of growth and interpretations are necessary for taking needful by the government. In this paper, we have tried to interpret the spreading capability of novel corona virus in India taking into consideration of 21 days lockdown data. The prediction is based on the present number of available cases and number of new cases reporting daily. We have explained the number of infected people in India comparing with Italy, China, Spain, and USA data of 21 days individually after announcing lockdown. The plot of daily new cases with the number of days spent after lockdown is fitted by linear and polynomial function. The best fitted graph is chosen for interpretation and that is based on the parameters obtained from fitting. The forecast of maximum spreading possibility is discussed with linear and 4-degree polynomial fitting parameters. Finally, some further preventive measurements are also discussed.","Bhattacharyya, A.; Bhowmik, D.; Mukherjee, J.",2020-04-25,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.22.20075572,1,Dipak Bhowmik,IIT Kanpur,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20075572v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20075572v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
10579,"The impact of SARS-CoV-2 transmission fear and COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders, severe asthma, and other high-risk groups","BackgroundThe adverse effects of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of high-risk group patients for morbidity and mortality and its impact on public health in the long term have not been clearly determined.

ObjectiveTo determine the level of COVID-19 related transmission fear and anxiety in healthcare workers and patients with primary immunodeficiency disorder (PID), severe asthma, and the ones with other comorbidities.

MethodsThe healthcare workers and patients with PID, severe asthma (all patients receiving biological agent treatment), malignancy, cardiovascular disease, hypertension (90% of patients receiving ACEI or ARB therapy), diabetes mellitus (42 % of patients receiving DPP-4 inhibitor therapy) were included in the study. A total of 560 participants, 80 individuals in each group, were provided. The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and Fear of illness and virus evaluation (FIVE) scales were applied to the groups with face to face interview methods.

ResultsThe mean age was 49.30 {+/-} 13.74 years and 306 (55 %) were female. The FIVE Scale and HADS-A scale scores of health care workers were significantly higher than other groups scores (p = 0.001 and 0.006). The second-highest scores belonged to patients with PID. There was no significant difference between the groups for the HADS-D score (p=0.07). The lowest score in all scales was observed in patients with hypertension.

ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that in the pandemic process, patients with primary immunodeficiency, asthma patients, and other comorbid patients, especially healthcare workers, should be referred to the centers for the detection and treatment of mental health conditions.","Colkesen, F.; Kilincel, O.; Sozen, M.; Yildiz, E.; Beyaz, S.; Colkesen, F.; Aytekin, G.; Kocak, M.

24883,Refining long-COVID by a prospective multimodal evaluation of patients with long-term symptoms related to SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundCOVID-19 long-haulers or """"long-COVID"""" represent 10% of COVID-19 patients and remain understudied.

MethodsIn this prospective study, we recruited 30 consecutive patients seeking medical help for persistent symptoms (> 30 days) attributed to COVID-19. All reported a viral illness compatible with COVID-19. The patients underwent a multi-modal evaluation including clinical, psychological, virological, specific immunological assays and were followed longitudinally.

ResultsThe median age was 40 [interquartile range: 35-54] and 18 (60%) were female. After a median time of 152 [102-164] days after symptom onset, fever, cough and dyspnea were less frequently reported as compared with the initial presentation, but paresthesia and burning pain emerged in 18 (60%) and 13 (43%) patients, respectively. The clinical examination was unremarkable in all patients although the median fatigue and pain visual analogic scales were 7 [5-8] and 5 [2-6], respectively.

Extensive biological studies were unremarkable, as were multiplex cytokine and ultra-sensitive interferon-a2 measurements. At this time, nasopharyngeal swab and stool RT-PCR were negative for all tested patients. Using SARS-CoV-2 serology and IFN-{gamma} ELISPOT, we found evidence of a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in 50% (15/30) of patients, with objective evidence of lack or waning of immune response in two. Finally, psychiatric evaluation showed that 11 (36.7%), 13 (43.3%) and 9 (30%) patients had a positive screening for anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, respectively.

ConclusionsHalf of patients seeking medical help for long-COVID lack SARS-CoV-2 immunity. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 immunity did not cluster clinically or biologically long haulers, who reported severe fatigue, altered quality of life, and exhibited psychological distress.

10581,Design and rationale of the Longitudinal Evaluation of Norms and Networks Study (LENNS): A cluster-randomized trial assessing the impact of a norms-centric intervention on exclusive toilet use and maintenance in peri-urban communities of Tamil Nadu,"IntroductionInconsistent toilet usage is a continuing challenge in India. Despite the impact of social expectations on toilet usage, few programs and studies have developed theoretically grounded norms-centric behavior change interventions to increase toilet use in low-income settings. This protocol details the rationale and design of an ex-ante, parallel cluster-randomized trial evaluating the impact of a demand-side, norms-centric behavior change intervention on exclusive toilet use and maintenance in peri-urban Tamil Nadu, India.

Methods and AnalysisFollowing two years of formative research, we developed an evidence-based norm-centric behavior change intervention called Nam Nalavazhvu (Tamil for """"Our wellbeing""""). The multi-level intervention aims to shift collective beliefs by shifting empirical expectations or beliefs about other relevant peoples sanitation practices. It also provides action-oriented information to aid individuals to set goals and overcome barriers to build, consistently use and maintain their toilets. This trial includes 76 wards in Pudukkottai and Karur districts, where half were randomly assigned to receive the intervention and the remaining serve as counterfactuals. During baseline and endline (conducted one year after the initiation of intervention) assessments, we collect relevant data and compare results between study arms to determine the impacts of the Nam Nalavazhvu intervention on sanitation-related behavioral, health, wellbeing outcomes and potential moderators. This study is powered to detect differences in the prevalence of exclusive toilet use between study arms. We will also conduct a process evaluation to understand the extent to which the intervention was implemented, as designed.

Ethics and DisseminationThe study protocol has been reviewed and approved by the ethics board at the University of Pennsylvania, USA and the Catalyst Foundation, India. Research findings will be disseminated through open access peer reviewed publications and presentations to stakeholders, government officials and conferences.

Trial registrationNCT04269824.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThis ex-ante, parallel cluster randomized trial assesses the impact of a norm-centric behavior change intervention strategy to improve sanitation practices. These behavior change techniques are novel to the sanitation sector but has been effective in changing a variety of behaviors, such as water use, drinking behavior, and energy consumption.
C_LIO_LIThe study outcomes include health, wellbeing outcomes, and a careful assessment of changes in social beliefs, expectations, and social determinants of collective sanitation behaviors.
C_LIO_LIThis study is being rolled out during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This can potentially impact the effectiveness of this intervention package that uses community and network-based group activities. However, through a detailed process monitoring and evaluation we will be able to assess the impact on delivery, and subsequent behavior change in this unique setting.

8813,Development and Prospective Validation of a Transparent Deep Learning Algorithm for Predicting Need for Mechanical Ventilation,"IMPORTANCEObjective and early identification of hospitalized patients, and particularly those with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), who may require mechanical ventilation is of great importance and may aid in delivering timely treatment.

OBJECTIVETo develop, externally validate and prospectively test a transparent deep learning algorithm for predicting 24 hours in advance the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients and those with COVID-19.

DESIGNObservational cohort study

SETTINGTwo academic medical centers from January 01, 2016 to December 31, 2019 (Retrospective cohorts) and February 10, 2020 to May 4, 2020 (Prospective cohorts).

PARTICIPANTSOver 31,000 admissions to the intensive care units (ICUs) at two hospitals. Additionally, 777 patients with COVID-19 patients were used for prospective validation. Patients who were placed on mechanical ventilation within four hours of their admission were excluded.

MAIN OUTCOME(S) and MEASURE(S)Electronic health record (EHR) data were extracted on an hourly basis, and a set of 40 features were calculated and passed to an interpretable deep-learning algorithm to predict the future need for mechanical ventilation 24 hours in advance. Additionally, commonly used clinical criteria (based on heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, FiO2 and pH) was used to assess future need for mechanical ventilation. Performance of the algorithms were evaluated using the area under receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value.

RESULTSAfter applying exclusion criteria, the external validation cohort included 3,888 general ICU and 402 COVID-19 patients. The performance of the model (AUC) with a 24-hour prediction horizon at the validation site was 0.882 for the general ICU population and 0.918 for patients with COVID-19. In comparison, commonly used clinical criteria and the ROX score achieved AUCs in the range of 0.773 - 0.782 and 0.768 - 0.810 for the general ICU population and patients with COVID-19, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS and RELEVANCEA generalizable and transparent deep-learning algorithm improves on traditional clinical criteria to predict the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients, including those with COVID-19. Such an algorithm may help clinicians with optimizing timing of tracheal intubation, better allocation of mechanical ventilation resources and staff, and improve patient care.","Shashikumar, S.

11397,The Age Pattern of the Male- to- Female Ratio in Mortality from COVID-19 Mirrors that of Cardiovascular Disease but not Cancer in the General Population,"BackgroundMales are at a higher risk of dying from COVID-19. Older age and cardiovascular disease are also associated with COVID-19 mortality. We compared the male-to-female (sex) ratios in mortality by age for COVID-19 with cardiovascular mortality and cancer mortality in the general population.

MethodsWe obtained data from official government sources in the US and five European countries: Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. We analyzed COVID-19 deaths by sex and age in these countries and similarly analyzed their deaths from cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease or stroke) and cancer, the two leading age-related causes of death in middle-to-high income countries.

FindingsIn both the US and European countries, the sex ratio of deaths from COVID-19 exceeded one throughout adult life. The sex ratio increased up to a peak in midlife, and then declined markedly in later life. This pattern was also observed for the sex ratio of deaths from cardiovascular disease, but not cancer, in the general populations of the US and European countries.

InterpretationThe sex ratios of deaths from COVID-19 and from cardiovascular disease exhibit similar patterns across the adult life course. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, but could stem partially from sex-related biological differences that underlie the similar pattern for cardiovascular disease. These include, we propose, comparatively longer telomeres in females, ovarian hormones, and X chromosome mosaicism.

FundingThe authors received no specific funding for this work.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSMortality from COVID-19 is higher in males and older persons. We searched PubMed.gov in June 2020, with no date restrictions, for articles published in English using the search terms """"COVID-19"""", """"deaths"""", """"mortality"""", """"sex"""", """"male"""", """"female"""", """"age"""", """"disaggregated"""", """"ratio"""", and """"stratified"""". We identified studies in several countries that stratified COVID-19 mortality data by age or by sex, but no study examined male-to-female (sex) ratios by age at a multi-national level.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the first study to aggregate data on COVID-19 deaths at a multi-national level, and analyze how the sex ratio in deaths varies by age, taking into account the population at risk in each sex/age stratum. We found a distinctive pattern in sex ratio of deaths by age, illuminating the nature of the sex effect on death from COVID-19. Moreover, we found a similar pattern in sex ratio of deaths by age for cardiovascular disease, which is strongly associated with increased risk of dying from COVID-19. We did not find a similar age pattern for the sex ratio in deaths by cancer.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe sex ratio in deaths from COVID-19 peaks in middle age and decreases at older ages, a pattern mirrored in deaths from cardiovascular disease. This intriguing similarity warrants research about whether sex-based differences in mortality from COVID-19 and from cardiovascular disease in general are partly due to common biological causes.","Nimgaonkar, I.; Valeri, L.; Susser, E.

9603,Power Laws in Superspreading Events: Evidence from Coronavirus Outbreaks and Implications for SIR Models,"While they are rare, superspreading events (SSEs), wherein a few primary cases infect an extraordinarily large number of secondary cases, are recognized as a prominent determinant of aggregate infection rates ([R]0). Existing stochastic SIR models incorporate SSEs by fitting distributions with thin tails, or finite variance, and therefore predicting almost deterministic epidemiological outcomes in large populations. This paper documents evidence from recent coronavirus outbreaks, including SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, that SSEs follow a power law distribution with fat tails, or infinite variance. We then extend an otherwise standard SIR model with the estimated power law distributions, and show that idiosyncratic uncertainties in SSEs will lead to large aggregate uncertainties in infection dynamics, even with large populations. That is, the timing and magnitude of outbreaks will be unpredictable. While such uncertainties have social costs, we also find that they on average decrease the herd immunity thresholds and the cumulative infections because per-period infection rates have decreasing marginal effects. Our findings have implications for social distancing interventions: targeting SSEs reduces not only the average rate of infection ([R]0) but also its uncertainty. To understand this effect, and to improve inference of the average reproduction numbers under fat tails, estimating the tail distribution of SSEs is vital.","Fukui, M.; Furukawa, C.",2020-06-26,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.11.20128058,2,Masao Fukui,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.11.20128058v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.11.20128058v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
11549,The effect of international travel restrictions on internal spread of COVID-19,"BackgroundCountries have restricted international arrivals to delay the spread of COVID-19. These measures carry a high economic and social cost. They may have little impact on COVID-19 epidemics if there are many more cases resulting from local transmission compared to imported cases.

MethodsTo inform decisions about international travel restrictions, we compared the ratio of expected COVID-19 cases from international travel (assuming no travel restrictions) to the expected COVID-19 cases arising from internal spread on an average day in May 2020 in each country. COVID-19 prevalence and incidence were estimated using a modelling framework that adjusts reported cases for under-ascertainment and asymptomatic infections.

FindingsWith May 2019 travel volumes, imported cases account for <10% of total incidence in 103 (95% credible interval: 76 - 130) out of 142 countries, and <1% in 48 (95% CrI: 9 - 95). If we assume that travel would decrease compared to May 2019 even in the absence of formal restrictions, then imported cases account for <10% of total incidence in 109-123 countries and <1% in 61-88 countries (depending on the assumptions about travel reductions).

InterpretationWhile countries can expect infected travellers to arrive in the absence of travel restrictions, in most countries these imported cases likely contribute little to local COVID-19 epidemics. Stringent travel restrictions may have limited impact on epidemic dynamics except in countries with low COVID-19 incidence and large numbers of arrivals from other countries.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSCountries are at different stages of COVID-19 epidemics, so many have implemented policies to minimise the risk of importing cases via international travel. Such policies include border closures, flight suspensions, quarantine and self-isolation on international arrivals. Searching PubMed and MedRxiv using the search: (""""covid"""" OR """"coronavirus"""" OR """"SARS-CoV-2"""") AND (""""travel"""" OR """"restrictions"""" OR """"flight"""" OR """"flights"""" OR """"border"""") from 1 January - 10 July 2020 returned 118 and 84 studies respectively, of which 39 were relevant to our study. These studies either concentrated in detail on the risk of importation to specific countries or used a single epidemiological or travel dataset to estimate risk. Most of them focused on the risk of COVID-19 introduction from China or other countries with cases earlier in 2020. No study combined country-specific travel data, prevalence estimates and incidence estimates to assess the global risk of importation relative to current local transmission within countries.

Added value of this studyWe combined data on airline passengers and flight frequencies with estimates of COVID-19 prevalence and incidence (adjusted for underreporting and asymptomatic cases), to estimate the risk of imported cases, relative to the level of local transmission in each country. This allows decision makers to determine where travel restriction policies make large contributions to slowing local transmission, and where they have very little overall effect.

Implications of all the available evidenceIn most countries, imported cases would make a relatively small contribution to local transmission, so travel restrictions would have very little effect on epidemics. Countries where travel restrictions would have a large effect on local transmission are those with strong travel links to countries with high COVID-19 prevalence and/or countries which have successfully managed to control their local outbreaks.","Russell, T.

24419,Rapid genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in a dense urban community using environmental (sewage) samples,"Understanding disease burden and transmission dynamics in resource-limited, developing countries like Nepal is often challenging due to a lack of adequate surveillance systems. These issues are exacerbated by limited access to diagnostic and research facilities throughout the country. Nepal has one of the highest COVID-19 case rates (915 cases per 100,000 people) in South Asia, with densely-populated Kathmandu experiencing the highest number of cases. Swiftly identifying case clusters and introducing effective intervention programs is crucial to mounting an effective containment strategy. The rapid identification of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants can also provide important information on viral evolution and epidemiology. Genomic-based environmental surveillance can help in the early detection of outbreaks before clinical cases are recognized, and identify viral micro-diversity that can be used for designing real-time risk-based interventions. This research aimed to develop a genomic-based environmental surveillance system by detecting and characterizing SARS-CoV-2 in sewage samples of Kathmandu using portable next-generation DNA sequencing devices. Out of 20 selected sites in the Kathmandu Valley, sewage samples from 16 (80%) sites had detectable SARS-CoV-2. A heat-map was created to visualize transmission activity in the community based on viral load intensity and corresponding geospatial data. Further, 41 mutations were observed in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

24588,Statins Are Associated with Improved 28-day Mortality in Patients Hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"BackgroundStatins may be protective in viral infection and have been proposed as treatment in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

ObjectiveWe evaluated the effect of statins on mortality in four groups hospitalized with (SARS-CoV-2) infection (continued statin, newly initiated statin, discontinued statin, never on statin).

DesignIn a single center cohort study of 1179 patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the outcome of death, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission or hospital discharge was evaluated. Patients statin use, laboratory data, and co-morbidities were determined via chart review and electronic health records. Using marginal structural models to account for timing of statin initiation and competing risks, we compared the likelihood of severe outcomes in the four statin exposure groups.

SettingAcademic medical center in the United States

ParticipantsPatients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection

Measurements28-day mortality, ICU admission, or discharge

ResultsAmong 1179 patients, 360 were never on a statin, 311 were newly initiated on a statin, 466 were continued on a statin, and 42 had a statin discontinued. In this cohort, 154 (13.1%) patients died by 28-days. With marginal structural model analysis, statin use reduced the hazard of 28-day mortality (HR 0.566 [CI 0.372, 0.862], p = 0.008). Both new initiation of statins (HR 0.493 [CI 0.253, 0.963], p=0.038) and continuing statin therapy reduced the hazard of 28-day mortality (HR 0.270 [CI 0.114, 0.637], p=0.003). Sensitivity analysis found that statin use was associated with improved mortality for patients > 65 years, but not for patients 65 years or younger.

LimitationObservational design

ConclusionStatin therapy during hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including new initiation and continuation of therapy, was associated with reduced short-term mortality.","Memel, Z.

8637,Quantitative assessment of the risk of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection: prospective and retrospective applications,"Airborne transmission is a recognized pathway of contagion; however, it is rarely quantitatively evaluated. This study presents a novel approach for quantitative assessment of the individual infection risk of susceptible subjects exposed in indoor microenvironments in the presence of an asymptomatic infected SARS-CoV-2 subject. The approach allowed the maximum risk for an exposed healthy subject to be evaluated or, starting from an acceptable risk, the maximum exposure time. We applied the proposed approach to four distinct scenarios for a prospective assessment, highlighting that, in order to guarantee an acceptable individual risk of 10-3 for exposed subjects in naturally ventilated indoor environments, the exposure time should be shorter than 20 min. The proposed approach was used for retrospective assessment of documented outbreaks in a restaurant in Guangzhou (China) and at a choir rehearsal in Mount Vernon (USA), showing that, in both cases, the high attack rate values can be justified only assuming the airborne transmission as the main route of contagion. Moreover, we shown that such outbreaks are not caused by the rare presence of a superspreader, but can be likely explained by the co-existence of conditions, including emission and exposure parameters, leading to a highly probable event, which can be defined as a """"superspreading event"""".","Buonanno, G.; Morawska, L.; Stabile, L.",2020-06-02,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.01.20118984,1,Luca Stabile,University of Cassino and Southern Lazio,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.01.20118984v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.01.20118984v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.envint.2020.106112
20769,The feasibility of targeted test-trace-isolate for the control of SARS-CoV-2 variants,"The SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 reportedly exhibits substantially higher transmission than the ancestral strain and may generate a major surge of cases before vaccines become widely available, while the P.1 and B.1.351 variants may be equally transmissible and also resist vaccines. All three variants can be sensitively detected by RT-PCR due to an otherwise rare del11288-11296 mutation in orf1ab; B.1.1.7 can also be detected using the common TaqPath kit. Testing, contact tracing, and isolation programs overwhelmed by SARS-CoV-2 could slow the spread of the new variants, which are still outnumbered by tracers in most countries. However, past failures and high rates of mistrust may lead health agencies to conclude that tracing is futile, dissuading them from redirecting existing tracers to focus on the new variants. Here we apply a branching-process model to estimate the effectiveness of implementing a variant-focused testing, contact tracing, and isolation strategy with realistic levels of performance. Our model indicates that bidirectional contact tracing can substantially slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants even in regions where a large fraction of the population refuses to cooperate with contact tracers or to abide by quarantine and isolation requests.","Bradshaw, W.

12969,COVID-19: Beliefs in misinformation in the Australian community,"ObjectivesTo investigate prevalence of beliefs in COVID-19 misinformation and examine whether demographic, psychosocial and cognitive factors are associated with these beliefs, and how they change over time.

Study designProspective national longitudinal community online survey.

SettingAustralian general public.

ParticipantsAdults aged over 18 years (n=4362 baseline/Wave 1; n=1882 Wave 2; n=1369 Wave 3).

Main outcome measureCOVID-19 misinformation beliefs.

ResultsStronger agreement with misinformation beliefs was significantly associated with younger age, male gender, lower education, and primarily speaking a language other than English at home (all p<0.01). After controlling for these variables, misinformation beliefs were significantly associated (p<0.001) with lower digital health literacy, lower perceived threat of COVID-19, lower confidence in government, and lower trust in scientific institutions. The belief that the threat of COVID-19 is """"greatly exaggerated"""" increased between Wave 1-2 (p=0.002), while belief that herd immunity benefits were being covered up decreased (p<0.001). Greatest support from a list of Australian Government identified myths was for those regarding  hot temperatures killing the virus (22%) and  Ibuprofen exacerbates COVID-19 (13%). Lower institutional trust and greater rejection of official government accounts were associated with greater support for COVID-19 myths after controlling for sociodemographic variables.

ConclusionThese findings highlight important gaps in communication effectiveness. Stronger endorsement of misinformation was associated with male gender, younger age, lower education and language other than English spoken at home. Misinformation can undermine public health efforts. Public health authorities must urgently target groups identified in this study when countering misinformation and seek ways to enhance public trust of experts, governments, and institutions.","Pickles, K.; Cvejic, E.; Nickel, B.; Copp, T.; Bonner, C.; Leask, J.; Ayre, J.; Batcup, C.; Cornell, S.; Dakin, T.; Dodd, R.; Isautier, J.

12763,False-Negative Mitigation in Group Testing for COVID-19 Screening,"After lifting the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions and opening businesses, screening is essential to prevent the spread of the virus. Group testing could be a promising candidate for screening to save time and resources. However, due to the high false-negative rate (FNR) of the RT-PCR diagnostic test, we should be cautious about using group testing because a groups false-negative result identifies all the individuals in a group as uninfected. Repeating the test is the best solution to reduce the FNR, and repeats should be integrated with the group-testing method to increase the sensitivity of the test. The simplest way is to replicate the test twice for each group (the 2Rgt method). In this paper, we present a new method for group testing (the groupMix method), which integrates two repeats in the test. Then we introduce the 2-stage sequential version of both the groupMix and the 2Rgt methods. We compare these methods analytically regarding the sensitivity and the average number of tests. The tradeoff between the sensitivity and the average number of tests should be considered when choosing the best method for the screening strategy. We applied the groupMix method to screening 263 people and identified 2 infected individuals by performing 98 tests. This method achieved a 63% saving in the number of tests compared to individual testing. Our experimental results show that in COVID-19 screening, the viral load can be low, and the group size should not be more than 6; otherwise, the FNR increases significantly. A web interface of the groupMix method is publicly available for laboratories to implement this method.","Alizad-Rahvar, A.

6321,The prevalence of common and stress-related mental health disorders in healthcare workers based in pandemic-affected hospitals: a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundHealthcare workers (HCWs) are considered at elevated risk of experiencing mental health disorders in working with patients with COVID-19.

AimsTo estimate the prevalence of common mental health disorders in HCWs based in hospitals where pandemic-affected patients were treated.

MethodDatabases were searched for studies published before 30th March 2020. Quantitative synthesis was used to obtain estimates of the prevalence of mental health disorders in four time windows, determined a priori (the acute phase, i.e. during and up to 1.5 months post-pandemic; 1.5-5.9 months; 6-11.9 months; 12 months and later).

ResultsNineteen studies met the review criteria. They predominantly addressed the acute phase of the SARS outbreak in Asia. The most studied outcomes were clinically-significant post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and general psychiatric caseness. For clinically significant PTSS in the acute phase, the prevalence estimate was 23.4% (95% CI 16.3, 31.2; N=4147; I2=96.2%); in the 12 months plus window, the estimate was 11.9% (8.4, 15.8; N=1136; I2=74.3%). For general psychiatric caseness, prevalence estimates were: acute phase, 34.1% (18.7, 51.4; N=3971; I2=99.1%); 6-12 months, 17.9% (13.1, 23.2; N=223; I2=0.0%); 12 months plus, 29.3% (6.0, 61.0; N=710; I2=97.8%).

ConclusionsMental health disorders are particularly common in HCWs working with pandemic-afflicted patients immediately following a pandemic, but the course of disorders following this period is poorly understood. PTSS remained elevated compared to the general population at 12 months, despite there being some evidence for natural recovery. There was considerable heterogeneity, likely linked to methodological differences. More extended follow up of HCWs is needed.","Allan, S.

23202,Estimating the super-spreading rate at workplaces using bluetooth technology,"Workplaces deploy internal guidelines to remain operational during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It is challenging to assess whether those interventions will prevent super-spreading events, where an infected individual transmits the disease to 10 or more secondary cases. Here we provide a model of infectious disease at the level of a workplace to address that problem. We take as input proximity contact records based on bluetooth technology and the infectious disease parameters from the literature. Using proximity contact data for a case-study workplace and an infection transmission model, we estimate the SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate as 0.014 per proximity contact, going up to 0.041 for the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant first detected in the UK. Defining super-spreading as events with 10 or more secondary infections, we obtain a super-spreading event rate of 2.3 per 1000 imported SARS-CoV-2 cases, rising up to 13.7 for SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7. This methodology provides the means for workplaces to determine their internal super-spreading rate or other infection related risks.","Vazquez, A.; Staebler, M.; Khanin, A.; Lichte, D.; Brucherseifer, E.",2021-03-08,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.03.04.21252550,1,Alexei Vazquez,"German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute for the Protection of Terrestrial Infrastructures",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.04.21252550v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.04.21252550v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
7464,Predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection trend using technical analysis indicators,"COVID-19 pandemic is a global emergency caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Without efficacious drugs or vaccines, mass quarantine has been the main strategy adopted by governments to contain the virus spread. This has led to a significant reduction in the number of infected people and deaths and to a diminished pressure over the health care system. However, an economic depression is following due to the forced absence of worker from their job and to the closure of many productive activities. For these reasons, governments are lessening progressively the mass quarantine measures to avoid an economic catastrophe. Nevertheless, the reopening of firms and commercial activities might lead to a resurgence of infection. In the worst-case scenario, this might impose the return to strict lockdown measures. Epidemiological models are therefore necessary to forecast possible new infection outbreaks and to inform government to promptly adopt new containment measures. In this context, we tested here if technical analysis methods commonly used in the financial market might provide early signal of change in the direction of SARS-Cov-2 infection trend in Italy, a country which has been strongly hit by the pandemic. We conclude that technical analysis indicators can be usefully adopted to this aim.","Paroli, M.; Sirinian, M.

25457,Impact of national and regional lockdowns on COVID-19 epidemic waves: Application to the 2020 spring wave in France,"BackgroundThe efficacy of national lockdowns to control COVID-19 epidemics has been demonstrated. This study aimed at assessing the impact of national and regional lockdowns, in the context of quickly growing pandemic waves, considering the French first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic as a case study.

MethodsWe developed a compartmental epidemic model considering the demographic and age profile of the population of the 13 regions of metropolitan France. We assessed the impact on morbidity, mortality, and hospital resources of simulated national and regional lockdowns starting at different time.

ResultsIn a regional lockdown scenario aimed at preventing intensive care units (ICU) saturation in continental France in March 2020, almost all regions would have had to implement a lockdown within 10 days from the actual date of the nationwide implementation. By this date, 97% of ICU capacities would have been used and almost 7000 more lives would have been lost, compared to the March 17 lockdown which limited the mortality burden in hospital to 18 130 deaths. For slowly growing epidemics, with a lower reproduction number, the expected delays between regional lockdowns increases. However, the public health costs associated with these delays tend to grow exponentially with time.

ConclusionsIn a quickly growing pandemic wave, defining the timing of lockdowns at a regional rather than national level delays by a few days the implementation of a nationwide lockdown but leads to substantially higher morbi-mortality and stress on the healthcare system.

Key messagesO_LIIn a quickly growing pandemic wave, defining the timing of lockdowns at a regional level delays the implementation of a nationwide lockdown by a few days, but leads to substantially higher morbi-mortality and stress on the healthcare system.
C_LIO_LIThe impact of a delayed regional lockdown greatly depends on the reproduction number in the region, with morbi-mortality costs growing exponentially with the delay.
C_LIO_LIIf delayed regional lockdowns are necessary to ensure population acceptability, slowing down the epidemic ahead of the measure may decrease the morbi-mortality associated with this delay.

10264,Using Machine Learning to assess Covid-19 risks,"IMPORTANCEIdentifying potential Covid-19 patients in the general population is a huge challenge at the moment. Given the low availability of infected Covid-19 patients clinical data, it is challenging to understand and comprehend similar and complex patterns in these symptomatic patients. Laboratory testing for Covid19 antigen with RT-PCR | (Reverse Transcriptase) is not possible or economical for whole populations.

OBJECTIVETo develop a Covid risk stratifier model that classifies people into different risk cohorts, based on their symptoms and validate the same.

DESIGNAnalysis of Covid cases across Wuhan and New York were done to identify the course of these cases prior to being symptomatic and being hospitalised for the infection. A dataset based on these statistics were generated and was then fed into an unsupervised learning algorithm to reveal patterns and identify similar groups of people in the population. Each of these cohorts were then classified and identified into three risk levels that were validated against the real world cases and studies.

SETTINGThe study is based on general population.

PARTICIPANTSThe adult population were considered for the analysis, development and validation of the model

RESULTSOf 1 million observations generated, 20% of them exhibited Covid symptoms and patterns, and 80% of them belonged to the asymptomatic and non-infected group of people. Upon clustering, three clinically obvious clusters were obtained, out of which the Cluster A had 20% of the symptomatic cases that were classified into one cohort, the other two cohorts, Cluster B had people with no symptoms but with high number of comorbidities and Cluster C had people with few leading indicators for the infection with few comorbidities. This was then validated against 300 participants whose data we collected as a part of a research study through our Covid-research tool and about 92% of them were classified correctly.

CONCLUSIONA model was developed and validated that classifies people into Covid risk categories based on their symptoms. This can be used to monitor and track cases that rapidly transition into being symptomatic which eventually get tested positive for the infection in order to initiate early medical interventions.","Prakash, A.; Muthya, S.; Arokiaswamy, T.

Among industrial settings, meat processing facilities in the United States have experienced particularly challenging outbreaks. We have sequenced SARS-CoV-2 whole viral genomes from individuals testing positive in an integrated regional healthcare system serving 21 counties in southwestern Wisconsin, northeastern Iowa and southeastern Minnesota, providing an overview of SARS-CoV-2 introduction and spread in a region spanning multiple jurisdictions with differing mitigation policies. While most viral introductions we detected were contained with only minor transmission chains, a striking exception was an outbreak associated with a meatpacking plant in Postville, IA. In this case, a single viral introduction led to unrestrained spread within the facility, affecting many staff and members of their households. Importantly, by surveilling viral sequences from the surrounding counties, we have documented the spread of this SARS-CoV-2 substrain from this epicenter to individuals in 13 cities in 7 counties in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota, a region spanning 185 square miles. This study highlights the regional public health consequences of failures to rapidly act to mitigate viral spread in a single industrial setting.","Richmond, C. S.; Sabin, A. P.; Jobe, D.

For this reason, we decide to describe preliminary data showing the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in children with known household exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

Our report shows that household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is high in both adults and children, with similar rates of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in all age groups, including the younger children. A total of 44 out of 80 household contacts (55%) of index patients had anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG. In particular, 16 (59,26%) adult partners had IgG antibodies compared with 28 (52,83%) of pediatric contacts (P > 0.05). Among the pediatric population, children [&ge;] 5 years of age had similar probability of having SARS-CoV-2 IgG (21/39, 53.8%) compared with those < 5 years (7/14, 50%) (P > 0.05). Adult partners and children also had a probability of having SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Interestingly, 35.7% of children and 33.3% of adults with SARS-CoV-2 IgG were previously diagnosed as COVID-19 cases.

Since this evidence of high rate of IgG in children exposed to SARS-CoV-2 has public health implication, with this comment we highlight the need of establishing appropriate guidelines for school opening and other social activities related to childhood.","Buonsenso, D.; Valentini, P.; De Rose, C.; Pata, D.; Sinatti, D.; Speziale, D.; Ricci, R.; Carfi, A.; Landi, F.; Sanguinetti, M.; Sali, M.",2020-08-12,Pediatrics,10.1101/2020.08.10.20169912,1,Danilo Buonsenso,"Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

MethodsWe performed a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 treated with HFNC and/or NIPPV to describe rates of success (live discharge without endotracheal intubation (ETI)), and identify characteristics associated with failure (ETI and/or in-hospital mortality) using Fine-Gray sub-distribution hazard models.

ResultsA total of 331 and 747 patients received HFNC and NIPPV as the highest level of non-invasive respiratory support, respectively; 154 (46.5%) in the HFNC cohort and 167 (22.4%) in the NIPPV cohort were successfully discharged without requiring ETI. In adjusted models, significantly increased risk of HFNC and NIPPV failure was seen among patients with cardiovascular disease (subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) 1.82; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17-2.83 and sHR 1.40; 95% CI 1.06-1.84), respectively, and among those with lower oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2) ratio at HFNC and NIPPV initiation (sHR, 0.32; 95% CI 0.19-0.54, and sHR 0.34; 95% CI 0.21-0.55, respectively).

ConclusionsA significant proportion of patients receiving non-invasive respiratory modalities for COVID-19 AHRF achieved successful discharge without requiring ETI, with lower success rates among those with cardiovascular disease or more severe hypoxemia. The role of non-invasive respiratory modalities in COVID-19 related AHRF requires further consideration.","Wang, J.

20154,Toward a COVID-19 testing policy: where and how to test when the purpose is to isolate silent spreaders,"BackgroundTo stop pandemics, such as COVID-19, infected individuals should be detected, treated if needed, and -to prevent contacts with susceptible individuals-isolated. Because most infected individuals may be asymptomatic, when testing misses such cases, epidemics may growth exponentially, inducing a high number of deaths. In contrast, a relatively low number of COVID-19 related deaths may occur when both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases are tested.

MethodsTo evaluate these hypotheses, a method composed of three elements was evaluated, which included: (i) county- and country-level geo-referenced data, (ii) cost-benefit related considerations, and (iii) temporal data on mortality or test positivity (TP). TP is the percentage of infections found among tested individuals. Temporal TP data were compared to the tests/case ratio (T/C ratio) as well as the number of tests performed/million inhabitants (tests/mi) and COVID-19 related deaths/million inhabitants (deaths/mi).

FindingsTwo temporal TP profiles were distinguished, which, early, displayed low ([~] 1 %) and/or decreasing TP percentages or the opposite pattern, respectively. Countries that exhibited >10 TP % expressed at least ten times more COVID-19 related deaths/mi than low TP countries. An intermediate pattern was identified when the T/C ratio was explored. Geo-referenced, TP-based analysis discovered municipalities where selective testing would be more cost-effective than alternatives.

InterpretationsWhen TP is low and/or the T/C ratio is high, testing detects asymptomatic cases and the number of COVID-19 related deaths/mi is low. Geo-referenced TP data can support cost-effective, site-specific policies. TP promotes the prompt cessation of epidemics and fosters science-based testing policies.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSTo map this field, bibliographic searches were conducted in the Web of Science, which included the following results: (i) COVID-19 (95,133 hits), (ii) SARS COV-2 (33,680 hits), (iii) testing policy and COVID-19 (939 hits), (iv) testing policy and SARS COV-2 (340 hits), (v) testing policy and COVID-19 and asymptomatic (80 hits), (vi) testing policy and SARS COV-2 and asymptomatic (54 hits); (vii) test positivity and COVID-19 and validation (7 hits), and (viii) test positivity and SARS CoV-2 and validation (5 hits). Therefore, before this study, testing policy in relation to asymptomatic cases as well as test positivity represented a very low proportion (between [~]1 thousandth to [~] 1 ten thousandth) of all publications. While many articles distinguished between diagnostic and screening tests, no paper was found in which testing policy is mentioned as part of a process ultimately designed to isolate all infected individuals. The few articles that mentioned test positivity only investigated symptomatic cases. These quanti/qualitative assessments led the authors to infer that neither testing policy nor test positivity had been adequately validated and/or investigated.

Added value of this studyWe provide the first validation of test positivity as an estimate of disease prevalence under rapidly changing conditions: in pandemics, disease prevalence may vary markedly within short periods of time. We also address a double limitation of control campaigns against COVID-19, namely: it is unknown who and where to test. Asymptomatic cases are not likely to seek medical assistance: while they feel well, they silently spread this pandemic. Because they represent approximately half of all infected individuals, they are a large, moving, and invisible target. Where to find them is also unknown because (i) randomized testing is likely to fail and (ii) testing is very limited. Usually, the locations where infected people reside are not randomly distributed but geographically clustered, and, up to now less than four persons per thousand inhabitants are tested on a given day. However, by combining geo-referenced test positivity data with cost-benefit considerations, we generate approaches not only likely to induce high benefits without increasing costs but also free of assumptions: we measure bio-geography as it is.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe fact that asymptomatic cases were not tested in many countries may explain the exponential growth and much higher number of deaths observed in those countries. Ineffective testing (and, therefore, ineffective isolation) can also result from the absence of geo-referenced data analysis. Because the geographical location where people reside, work, study, or shop is not a random event, the analysis of small greographical areas is essential. Only when actual geographical relationships are observed, optimal (cost-benefit oriented) testing policies can be devised.","Rivas, A. L.; Hoogesteijn, A. L.; Hittner, J.; Van Regenmortel, M.

24093,System-wide hematopoietic and immune signaling aberrations in COVID-19 revealed by deep proteome and phosphoproteome analysis,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has become a global crisis. To gain systems-level insights into its pathogenesis, we compared the blood proteome and phosphoproteome of ICU patients with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection, and healthy control subjects by quantitative mass spectrometry. We find that COVID-19 is marked with hyperactive T cell and B cell signaling, compromised innate immune response, and dysregulated inflammation, coagulation, metabolism, RNA splicing, transcription and translation pathways. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes global reprogramming of the kinome and kinase-substrate network, resulting in defective antiviral defense via the CK2-OPN-IL-12/IFN-/{beta} axis, lymphocyte cell death via aberrant JAK/STAT signaling, and inactivation of innate immune cells via inhibitory SIRPA, SIGLEC and SLAM family receptor signaling. Our work identifies CK2, SYK, JAK3, TYK2 and IL-12 as potential targets for immunomodulatory treatment of severe COVID-19 and provides a valuable approach and resource for deciphering the mechanism of pathogen-host interactions.","Kaneko, T.; Esmail, S.; Voss, C.; Martin, C.

23170,SARS-CoV-2 transmission in intercollegiate athletics not fully mitigated with daily antigen testing,"BackgroundHigh frequency, rapid turnaround SARS-CoV-2 testing continues to be proposed as a way of efficiently identifying and mitigating transmission in congregate settings. However, two SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks occurred among intercollegiate university athletic programs during the fall 2020 semester despite mandatory directly observed daily antigen testing.

MethodsDuring the fall 2020 semester, athletes and staff in both programs were tested daily using Quidels Sofia SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA), with positive antigen results requiring confirmatory testing with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We used genomic sequencing to investigate transmission dynamics in these two outbreaks.

ResultsIn Outbreak 1, 32 confirmed cases occurred within a university athletics program after the index patient attended a meeting while infectious despite a negative antigen test on the day of the meeting. Among isolates sequenced from Outbreak 1, 24 (92%) of 26 were closely related, suggesting sustained transmission following an initial introduction event. In Outbreak 2, 12 confirmed cases occurred among athletes from two university programs that faced each other in an athletic competition despite receiving negative antigen test results on the day of the competition. Sequences from both teams were closely related and unique from strains circulating in the community, suggesting transmission during intercollegiate competition.

ConclusionsThese findings suggest that antigen testing alone, even when mandated and directly observed, may not be sufficient as an intervention to prevent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in congregate settings, and highlights the importance of supplementing serial antigen testing with appropriate mitigation strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in congregate settings.

SummaryHigh frequency, rapid turnaround SARS-CoV-2 testing continues to be proposed as a way of efficiently identifying and mitigating transmission in congregate settings.

19099,Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of adults with mental health conditions in the UK: A qualitative interview study,"BackgroundPeople with mental health conditions have been identified as particularly vulnerable to poor mental health during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, why this population have faced these adverse effects, how they have experienced them and how they have coped remains under-explored.

AimsTo explore how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the mental health of people with existing mental health conditions, and to identify coping strategies for positive mental health.

MethodsSemi-structured qualitative interviews with 22 people with mental health conditions. Participants were purposively recruited via social media, study newsletters and third sector mental health organisations. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.

ResultsParticipants were aged 23-70 (mean age 43), predominantly female (59.1%) and of white ethnicity (68.2%). Fifty percent were unable to work due to illness and the most frequently reported mental health condition was depression. Five pandemic related factors contributed to deteriorating mental health: i) feeling safe but isolated at home ii) disruption to mental health services, iii) cancelled plans and changed routines iv) uncertainty and lack of control, v) rolling media coverage. Five coping strategies were identified for maintaining mental health: i) previous experience of adversity ii) social comparison and accountability iii) engaging in hobbies and activities, iv) staying connected with others, v) perceived social support.

ConclusionsChallenges were identified as a direct result of the pandemic and people with severe mental illnesses were particularly negatively affected. However, some found this period a time of respite, drew upon reserves of resilience and adapted their coping strategies to maintain positive wellbeing.","Burton, A.; Mckinlay, A.; Aughterson, H.; Fancourt, D.",2020-12-03,Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology,10.1101/2020.12.01.20241067,1,Alexandra Burton,University College London Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.01.20241067v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.01.20241067v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

16147,An open-label prospective observational study of antiandrogen and non-antiandrogen early pharmacological approaches in females with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. The Pre-AndroCoV Female Trial.,"BackgroundWhile COVID-19 remains largely unclear and mortality continues to raise, early effective approaches prior to complications lack, as well as researches for characterization and therapeutical potential options in actual early COVID-19. Although females seem to be less affected than females, hyperandrogenic (HA) phenotype, like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), idiopathic hirsutism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) female androgenetic alopecia (AGA), or idiopathic HA may be at higher risk due to its inherent enhanced androgenic activity. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of any early pharmacological approach to females diagnosed with COVID-19 before seven days of symptoms, as well as investigate whether HA is an additional risk factor in this population.

Materials and methodsFemales with symptoms for less than seven days confirmed for COVID-19 through positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2) were classified and divided as non-HA, HA, and HA using spironolactone (HA-spiro) groups. Patients were questioned for baseline characteristics, 23 different diseases, 44 drug classes and vaccines, 28 different symptoms, and eight different parameters to measure COVID-19 related clinical outcomes. Treatment was then provided, including azithromycin 500mg/day for five days in all cases, associated with hydroxychloroquine 400mg/day for five days, nitazoxanide 500mg twice a day for six days, or ivermectin 0.2mg/kg/day por three days, and optionally spironolactone 100mg twice a day until cure. Patients were assessed for COVID-19 clinical course, clinical and viral duration, and disease progression.

ResultsIn total, 270 females were enrolled, including 195, 67, and eight in non-HA, HA, and HA-spiro groups, respectively. Prevailing symptoms were anosmia (71.1%), ageusia (67.0%), headache (48.1%), myalgia (37.4%), dry cough (36.3%), nasal congestion or rhinorrhea (34.1%), fatigue (33.3%), weakness (29.5%), hyporexia (27.8%), thoracic pain (24.8%), diarrhea (24.1%) and dizziness (21.5%). Earliest symptoms (days) were dizziness (1.0 {+/-} 0.2 day), abdominal pain (1.1 {+/-} 0.3); conjunctival hyperemia (1.1 {+/-} 0.5), nasal congestion or rhinorrhea (1.2 {+/-} 0.5), headache (1.2 {+/-} 0.5), dry cough (1.2 {+/-} 0.5), myalgia (1.2 {+/-} 0.4), nauseas (1.3 {+/-} 0.5) and weakness (1.3 {+/-} 0.5). Time-to-treat, positive rtPCR, and duration of symptoms with and without anosmia and ageusia were significantly lower in HA-spiro than non-HA, HA, and overall non-users. Time-to-treat was similar while all duration of symptoms and positive rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 were significantly shorter in non-HA than HA. Spironolactone users were more likely to be asymptomatic than non-users during COVID-19. Fewer non-HA than HA females were affected by anosmia, ageusia, dry cough, fatigue, weakness and hyporexia. Ageusia, weakness and myalgia lasted shorter in non-HA than HA. None of the patients needed hospitalization or any other COVID-19 complication.

ConclusionsA sensitive, early detection of COVID-19 followed by a pharmaceutical approach with different drug combinations yielded irrefutable differences compared to sex-, age-, body mass index (BMI)-, and disease-matched non-treated controls in terms of clinical outcomes, ethically disallowing placebo-control randomized clinical trials in the early stage of COVID-19 due to the marked improvements. HA females presented more severe and prolonged clinical manifestations, although none progressed to worse outcomes. Spironolactone mitigated the additional risks due to HA.","Cadegiani, F.

4961,Mortality from COVID-19 in 12 countries and 6 states of the United States,"ImportanceReliable estimates of COVID-19 mortality are crucial to aid control strategies and to assess the effectiveness of interventions.

ObjectiveProject COVID-19 mortality trends to October 1, 2020, in 12 countries or regions that constitute >90% of the global COVID-19 deaths reported as of April 12, 2020.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThe Global COVID-19 Assessment of Mortality (GCAM) is an open, transparent, and continuously updated (www.cghr.org/covid) statistical model that combines actual COVID-19 mortality counts with Bayesian inference to forecast COVID-19 deaths, the date of peak deaths, and the duration of excess mortality. The analyses covered a total of 700 million population above age 20 in 12 countries or regions: USA; Italy; Spain; France; UK; Iran; Belgium; a province of China (Hubei, which accounted for 90% of reported Chinese deaths); Germany; the Netherlands; Switzerland; and Canada; and six US states: New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Louisiana, California, and Washington.

ResultsForecasted deaths across the 12 current high-burden countries sum 167,000 to 593,000 (median 253,000). The trajectory of US deaths (49,000-249,000 deaths; median 86,000)--over half of which are expected in states beyond the initial six states analysed in this study--will have the greatest impact on the eventual total. Mortality ranges are 25,000-109,000 (median 46,000) in the UK; 23,000-31,000 (median 26,000) in Italy; 21,000-37,000 (median 26,000) in France and 21,000-32,000 (median 25,000) in Spain. Estimates are most precise for Hubei, China--where the epidemic curve is complete--and least precise in California, where it is ongoing. New York has the highest cumulative median mortality rate per million (1135), about 12-fold that of Germany. Mortality trajectories are notably flatter in Germany, California, and Washington State, each of which took physical distancing and testing strategies seriously. Using past country-specific mortality as a guide, GCAM predicts surge capacity needs, reaching more than twice existing capacity in a number of places., In every setting, the results might be sensitive to undercounts of COVID-19 deaths, which are already apparent.

Conclusion and RelevanceMortality from COVID-19 will be substantial across many settings, even in the best case scenario. GCAM will provide continually updated and increasingly precise estimates as the pandemic progresses.

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has already caused over 115,000 deaths, with global deaths doubling every week.1-3 Mortality is less biased than case reporting, which is affected by testing policies. However, the daily reporting of COVID-19 deaths is already known to undercount actual deaths, varying over time and place.4-6

Reliable estimates of total COVID-19 mortality, the date of peak deaths, and of the duration of excess mortality are crucial to aid responses to the current and potential future pandemics. We have developed the Global COVID-19 Assessment of Mortality (GCAM), a statistical model to project COVID-19 mortality trends to October 1 2020 in 12 countries or regions that constitute >90% of the global COVID-19 deaths reported as of April 12th. We report also on six US states that account for 70% of the American totals to date (Supplementary Appendix).1 We quantify the COVID-19 mortality trajectory ranges in each setting. A semi-automated website (www.cghr.org/covid) provides daily updates. GCAM is open, transparent, and uses a reasonably simple method that employs publicly reported mortality data to make plausible projections. The method is designed to improve as more mortality data become available over longer time periods.","Brown, P.; Jha, P.; Cghr Covid Mortality Consortium,  ",2020-04-22,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.17.20069161,1,Prabhat Jha,University of Toronto,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069161v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069161v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
6981,The Estimated Time-Varying Reproduction Numbers during the Ongoing Pandemic of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 12 Selected Countries outside China,"BackgroundHow can we anticipate the progression of the ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)? As a measure of transmissibility, we aimed to estimate concurrently the time-varying reproduction number, R0(t), over time during the COVID-19 pandemic for each of the following 12 heavily-attacked countries: Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Belgium, United Kingdom, the United States of America, and South Africa.

MethodsWe downloaded the publicly available COVID-19 pandemic data from the WHO COVID-19 Dashboard website (https://covid19.who.int/) for the duration of January 11, 2020 and May 1, 2020. Then, we specified two plausible distributions of serial interval to apply the novel estimation method implemented in the incidence and EpiEstim packages to the data of daily new confirmed cases for robustly estimating R0(t) in the R software.

ResultsWe plotted the epidemic curves of daily new confirmed cases for the 12 selected countries. A clear peak of the epidemic curve appeared in 10 of the 12 selected countries at various time points, and then the epidemic curve declined gradually. However, the United States of America and South Africa happened to have two or more peaks and their epidemic curves either reached a plateau or still climbed up. Almost all curves of the estimated R0(t) monotonically went down to be less than or close to 1.0 up to April 30, 2020 except Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Iran, and South Africa, of which the curves surprisingly went up and down at various time periods during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the United States of America and South Africa were the two countries with the approximate R0(t) [&ge;] 1.0 at the end of April, and thus they were now facing the harshest battles against the coronavirus among the 12 selected countries. By contrast, Spain, Germany, and France with smaller values of the estimated R0(t) were relatively better than the other 9 countries.

ConclusionSeeing the estimated R0(t) going downhill speedily is more informative than looking for the drops in the daily number of new confirmed cases during an ongoing epidemic of infectious disease. We urge public health authorities and scientists to estimate R0(t) routinely during an epidemic of infectious disease and to report R0(t) daily to the public until the end of the epidemic.","Hu, F.-C.",2020-05-14,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.10.20097154,1,Fu-Chang Hu,"National Taiwan University, College of Medicine",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.10.20097154v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.10.20097154v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
18429,High throughput wastewater SARS-CoV-2 detection enables forecasting of community infection dynamics in San Diego county,"Large-scale wastewater surveillance has the ability to greatly augment the tracking of infection dynamics especially in communities where the prevalence rates far exceed the testing capacity. However, current methods for viral detection in wastewater are severely lacking in terms of scaling up for high throughput. In the present study, we employed an automated magnetic-bead based concentration approach for viral detection in sewage that can effectively be scaled up for processing 24 samples in a single 40-minute run. The method compared favorably to conventionally used methods for viral wastewater concentrations with higher recovery efficiencies from input sample volumes as low as 10ml and can enable the processing of over 100 wastewater samples in a day. The sensitivity of the high-throughput protocol was shown to detect cases as low as 2 in a hospital building with a known COVID-19 caseload. Using the high throughput pipeline, samples from the influent stream of the primary wastewater treatment plant of San Diego county (serving 2.3 million residents) were processed for a period of 13 weeks. Wastewater estimates of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome copies in raw untreated wastewater correlated strongly with clinically reported cases by the county, and when used alongside past reported case numbers and temporal information in an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model enabled prediction of new reported cases up to 3 weeks in advance. Taken together, the results show that the high-throughput surveillance could greatly ameliorate comprehensive community prevalence assessments by providing robust, rapid estimates.

ImportanceWastewater monitoring has a lot of potential for revealing COVID-19 outbreaks before they happen because the virus is found in the wastewater before people have clinical symptoms. However, application of wastewater-based surveillance has been limited by long processing times specifically at the concentration step. Here we introduce a much faster method of processing the samples, and show that its robustness by demonstrating direct comparisons with existing methods and showing that we can predict cases in San Diego by a week with excellent accuracy, and three weeks with fair accuracy, using city sewage. The automated viral concentration method will greatly alleviate the major bottleneck in wastewater processing by reducing the turnaround time during epidemics.","Karthikeyan, S.; Ronquillo, N.; Belda-Ferre, P.; Alvarado, D.; Javidi, T.; Longhurst, C.

5750,Determining the source of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a healthcare worker,"BackgroundHealthcare workers (HCWs) are at the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic and are at risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection from their interactions with patients and in the community (1, 2). Limited availability of recommended personal protective equipment (PPE), in particular N95 respirators, has fueled concerns about whether HCWs are adequately protected from exposure while caring for patients. Understanding the source of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a HCW - the community or the healthcare system - is critical for understanding the effectiveness of hospital infection control and PPE practices. In Dane County, Wisconsin, community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is relatively low (cumulative prevalence of ~0.06% - positive cases / total population in Dane county as of April 17). Although SARS-CoV-2 infections in HCWs are often presumed to be acquired during the course of patient care, there are few reports unambiguously identifying the source of acquisition.

ObjectiveTo determine the source of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a healthcare worker.","Safdar, N.; Moreno, G. K.; Braun, K. M.; Friedrich, T. C.; O'connor, D.

11046,Who is dying from Covid-19 in the United Kingdom? A review of cremation authorisations from a single South Wales' crematorium.,"BackgroundCovid 19 is pandemic in the UK. To date only studies in the UK on hospital deaths have been published in the peer reviewed literature. Legal requirements for cremation in England and Wales require the collection of information that can be used to improve understanding of Covid 19 deaths in both hospital and community settings.

AimTo document demographic and clinical characteristics, including likely place of infection, of individuals dying of Covid 19 to inform public health policy

DesignA comprehensive case series of deaths from Covid 19 between 6 April and 30 May.

SettingA crematorium in South Wales

ParticipantsIndividuals for whom an application was made for cremation.

Main outcome measuresAge, sex, date and place of death, occupation, comorbidities, where infection acquired.

ResultsOf 752 cremations, 215(28.6%) were Covid-19 of which 115 (53.5%) were male and 100 (46.5%) female. The median age was 82 years, with the youngest patient being 47 years and the oldest 103 years. Over half the deaths (121/215: 56.3%) were over 80 years. Males odds of dying in hospital, rather than the community were 1.96 times that of females (95% Confidence Intervals (CI) 1.03 -3.74, p=0.054) despite being of similar age and having a similar number of comorbidities. Only 21(9.8%) of 215 patients had no comorbidities recorded. Patients dying in nursing homes were significantly older than those dying in hospital(median 88y (IQ range 82-93y) v 80y (IQ range 71-87y): p<0.0001). Patients dying in hospital had significantly more comorbidities than those dying in nursing homes (median 2: IQ range 1-3 v. 1: IQ range 1-2: p <0.001).

ConclusionsIn a representative series, comprising both hospital and community deaths, persons over 80 with an average 2 comorbidities predominated. Although men and women were represented in similar proportions, men were more likely to die in hospital. Over half the infections were acquired in either hospitals or nursing and residential homes with implications for the management of the pandemic, historically and in the future.","Salmon, R.

22559,Targeting the Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Protein through GSK-3 Inhibition,"The coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and other coronavirus infections express a nucleocapsid protein (N) that is essential for viral replication, transcription, and virion assembly. Phosphorylation of N from SARS-CoV by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is required for its function and inhibition of GSK-3 with lithium impairs N phosphorylation, viral transcription, and replication. Here we report that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein contains GSK-3 consensus sequences and that this motif is conserved in diverse coronaviruses, despite limited overall sequence conservation, raising the possibility that SARS- CoV-2 may be sensitive to GSK-3 inhibitors including lithium. We conducted a retrospective analysis of lithium use in patients from three major health systems who were PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2. We found that patients taking lithium have a significantly reduced risk of COVID- 19 (odds ratio = 0.51 [0.34 - 0.76], p = 0.001). We also show that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is phosphorylated by GSK-3. Knockout of GSK3A and GSK3B demonstrates that GSK-3 is essential for N phosphorylation. Alternative GSK-3 inhibitors block N phosphorylation and impair replication in SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells in a cell-type dependent manner.

Targeting GSK-3 may therefore provide a new approach to treat COVID-19 and future coronavirus outbreaks.","Liu, X.; Verma, A.; Ramage, H.; Garcia, G.; Myers, R. L.; Lucas, A.; Michaelson, J.

13497,Genomic Diversity of SARS-CoV-2 During Early Introduction into the United States National Capital Region,"BackgroundThe early COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by rapid global spread. In the United States National Capital Region, over 2,000 cases were reported within three weeks of its first detection in March 2020. We aimed to use genomic sequencing to understand the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the region. By correlating genetic information to disease phenotype, we also aimed to gain insight into any correlation between viral genotype and case severity or transmissibility.

MethodsWe performed whole genome sequencing of clinical SARS-CoV-2 samples collected in March 2020 by the Johns Hopkins Health System. We analyzed these regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes alongside detailed clinical metadata and the global phylogeny to understand early establishment of the virus within the region.

ResultsWe analyzed 620 samples from the Johns Hopkins Health System collected between March 11-31, 2020, comprising 37.3% of the total cases in Maryland during this period. We selected 143 of these samples for sequencing, generating 114 complete viral genomes. These genomes belong to all five major Nextstrain-defined clades, suggesting multiple introductions into the region and underscoring the diversity of the regional epidemic. We also found that clinically severe cases had genomes belonging to all of these clades.

ConclusionsWe established a pipeline for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing within the Johns Hopkins Health system, which enabled us to capture the significant viral diversity present in the region as early as March 2020. Efforts to control local spread of the virus were likely confounded by the number of introductions into the region early in the epidemic and interconnectedness of the region as a whole.","Thielen, P.

23334,Quantification of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in Switzerland,"BackgroundIn December 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) reported a SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VoC) which is now coined B.1.1.7. Based on the UK data and later additional data from other countries, a transmission advantage of around 40-80% was estimated for this variant [1, 2, 3].

AimThe goal of this study is to estimate the transmission fitness advantage and the effective reproductive number of B.1.1.7 through time for data from Switzerland.

MethodsWe collected genomic surveillance data from 11.8% of all SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases across Switzerland between 14.12.2020 and 11.03.2021. It allows us to determine the relative proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant on a daily basis and to quantify the transmission advantage of the B.1.1.7 variant on a national and a regional scale.

ResultsWe propose a transmission advantage of 43-52% of B.1.1.7 compared to the other circulating variants. Further, we estimate a reproductive number for B.1.1.7 above 1 for Jan. 1, 2021 until now while the reproductive number for the other variants was below 1. In particular, for the time period up to Jan. 17 we obtain a reproductive number of 1.24 [1.07-1.41] and from Jan. 18 until March 1 we obtain 1.18 [1.06-1.30] based on the whole genome sequencing data. For March 10-16, we obtain 1.14 [1.00-1.26] based on all confirmed cases among which B.1.1.7 is dominant at this stage. Switzerland tightened measures on 18.01.2021 and released measures on 01.03.2021.

ConclusionIn summary, the dynamics of increase in the frequency of B.1.1.7 is as expected based on the observations in the UK. B.1.1.7 increased in absolute numbers exponentially with the point estimate for the doubling time being around 2-3.5 weeks. Our plots are available online and are currently regularly updated with new data to closely monitor the spread of B.1.1.7.","Chen, C.; Nadeau, S. A.; Topolsky, I.; Manceau, M.; Huisman, J.

20561,Indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic at two tertiary neonatal units in Zimbabwe and Malawi: an interrupted time series analysis,"BackgroundDeaths from COVID-19 have exceeded 1.8 million globally (January 2020). We examined trends in markers of neonatal care before and during the pandemic at two tertiary neonatal units in Zimbabwe and Malawi.

MethodsWe analysed data collected prospectively via the NeoTree app at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital (SMCH), Zimbabwe, and Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH), Malawi. Neonates admitted from 1 June 2019 to 25 September 2020 were included. We modelled the impact of the first cases of COVID-19 (Zimbabwe: 20 March 2020; Malawi: 3 April 2020) on number of admissions, gestational age and birth weight, source of admission referrals, prevalence of neonatal encephalopathy, and overall mortality.

FindingsThe study included 3,450 neonates at SMCH and 3,350 neonates at KCH. Admission numbers at SMCH did not initially change after the first case of COVID-19 but fell by 48% during a nurses strike (Relative risk (RR) 0{middle dot}52, 95%CI 0{middle dot}40-0{middle dot}68, p < 0{middle dot}002). At KCH, admissions dropped by 42% (RR 0{middle dot}58; 95%CI 0{middle dot}48-0{middle dot}70; p < 0{middle dot}001) soon after the first case of COVID-19. At KCH, gestational age and birth weight decreased slightly (1 week, 300 grams), outside referrals dropped by 28%, and there was a slight weekly increase in mortality. No changes in these outcomes were found at SMCH.

InterpretationThe indirect impacts of COVID-19 are context-specific. While this study provides vital evidence to inform health providers and policy makers, national data are required to ascertain the true impacts of the pandemic on newborn health.

FundingInternational Child Health Group, Wellcome Trust.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for evidence of the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on neonatal care in low-income settings using the search terms neonat* or newborn, and COVID-19 or SARS-CoV 2 or coronavirus, and the Cochrane low and middle income country (LMIC) filters, with no language limits between 01.10.2019 and 21.11.20. While there has been a decrease in global neonatal mortality rates, the smaller improvements seen in low-income settings are threatened by the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A modelling study of this threat predicted between 250000-1.1 million extra neonatal deaths as a result of decreased service provision and access in LMICs. A webinar and survey of frontline maternal/newborn healthcare workers in >60 countries reported a decline in both service attendance and in quality of service across the ante-, peri- and post-natal journey. Reporting fear of attending services, and difficulty in access, and a decrease in service quality due to exacerbation of existing service weaknesses, confusion over guidelines and understaffing. Similar findings were reported in a survey of healthcare workers providing childhood and maternal vaccines in LMICs. One study to date has reported data from Nepal describing an increase in stillbirths and neonatal deaths, with institutional deliveries nearly halved during lockdown.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the first and only study in Sub-Saharan Africa describing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on health service access and outcomes for newborns in two countries. We analysed data from the digital quality improvement and data collection tool, the NeoTree, to carry out an interrupted time series analysis of newborn admission rates, gestational age, birth weight, diagnosis of hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy and mortality from two large hospitals in Malawi and Zimbabwe (n[~]7000 babies). We found that the indirect impacts of COVID-19 were context-specific. In Sally Mugabe Central Hospital, Zimbabwe, initial resilience was demonstrated in that there was no evidence of change in mortality, birth weight or gestational age. In comparison, at Kamuzu Central Hospital, Malawi, soon after the first case of COVID-19, the data revealed a fall in admissions (by 42%), gestational age (1 week), birth weight (300 grams), and outside referrals (by 28%), and there was a slight weekly increase in mortality (2%). In the Zimbabwean hospital, admission numbers did not initially change after the first case of COVID-19 but fell by 48% during a nurses strike, which in itself was in response to challenges exacerbated by the pandemic.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur data confirms the reports from frontline healthcare workers of a perceived decline in neonatal service access and provision in LMICs. Digital routine healthcare data capture enabled rapid profiling of indirect impacts of COVID-19 on newborn care and outcomes in two tertiary referral hospitals, Malawi and Zimbabwe. While a decrease in service access was seen in both countries, the impacts on care provided and outcome differed by national context. Health systems strengthening, for example digital data capture, may assist in planning context-specific mitigation efforts.","Chimhuya, S.; Neal, S.

DesignA retrospective descriptive study

SettingChina

ParticipantsEpidemiology information was collected from publicly accessible database. 265 patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Center with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled for clinical features analysis.

Main outcome measurePrevention and control measures taken by Shanghai government, epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiology data were collected. Weibull distribution, Chi-square test, Fishers exact test, t test or Mann-Whitney U test were used in statistical analysis.

ResultsCOVID-19 transmission rate within Shanghai had reduced over 99% than previous speculated, and the exponential growth has been stopped so far. Epidemic was characterized by the first stage mainly composed of imported cases and the second stage where >50% of cases were local. The incubation period was 6.4 (95% CI 5.3 to 7.6) days and the mean onset-admission interval was 5.5 days (95% CI, 5.1 to 5.9). Median time for COVID-19 progressed to severe diseases were 8.5 days (IQR: 4.8-11.0 days). By February 11th, proportion of patients being mild, moderate, severe and critically ill were 1.9%(5/265), 89.8%(238/265), 3.8%(10/265), 4.5%(12/265), respectively; 47 people in our cohort were discharged, and 1 patient died.

ConclusionStrict controlling of the transmission rate at the early stage of an epidemic in metropolis can quickly prohibit the spread of the diseases. Controlling local clusters is the key to prevent outbreaks from imported cases. Most COVID-19 severe cases progressed within 14 days of disease onset. Multiple systemic laboratory abnormalities had been observed before significant respiratory dysfunction.","Lu, H.; Ai, J.; Shen, Y.; Li, Y.; Li, T.; Zhou, X.; Zhang, H.; Zhang, Q.; Ling, Y.; Wang, S.; Qu, H.; Gao, Y.; Li, Y.; Yu, K.; Zhu, D.; Zhu, H.; Tian, R.; Zeng, M.; Li, Q.; Song, Y.; Li, X.; Xu, J.; Xu, J.; Mao, E.; Hu, B.; Li, X.; Zhu, L.; Zhang, W.",2020-02-23,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.02.19.20025031,1,Wenhong Zhang,"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025031v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025031v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
20493,Value of radiomics features from adrenal gland and periadrenal fat CT images predicting COVID-19 progression,"BackgroundValue of radiomics features from the adrenal gland and periadrenal fat CT images for predicting disease progression in patients with COVID-19 has not been studied.

MethodsA total of 1,245 patients (685 moderate and 560 severe patients) were enrolled in a retrospective study. We proposed 3D V-Net to segment adrenal glands in onset CT images automatically, and periadrenal fat was obtained using inflation operation around the adrenal gland. Next, we built a clinical model (CM), three radiomics models (adrenal gland model [AM], periadrenal fat model [PM], and fusion of adrenal gland and periadrenal fat model [FM]), and radiomics nomogram (RN) after radiomics features extracted to predict disease progression in patients with COVID-19.

ResultsThe auto-segmentation framework yielded a dice value of 0.79 in the training set. CM, AM, PM, FM, and RN obtained AUCs of 0.712, 0.692, 0.763, 0.791, and 0.806, respectively in the training set. FM and RN had better predictive efficacy than CM (P < 0.0001) in the training set. RN showed that there was no significant difference in the validation set (mean absolute error [MAE] = 0.04) and test set (MAE = 0.075) between predictive and actual results. Decision curve analysis showed that if the threshold probability was more than 0.3 in the validation set or between 0.4 and 0.8 in the test set, it could gain more net benefits using RN than FM and CM.

ConclusionRadiomics features extracted from the adrenal gland and periadrenal fat CT images may predict progression in patients with COVID-19.

9885,Towards intervention development to increase the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination among those at high risk: outlining evidence-based and theoretically informed future intervention content,"ObjectivesDevelopment of a vaccine against COVID-19 will be key to controlling the pandemic. We need to understand the barriers and facilitators to receiving a future COVID-19 vaccine so that we can provide recommendations for the design of interventions aimed at maximising public acceptance.

DesignCross-sectional UK survey with older adults and patients with chronic respiratory disease.

MethodsDuring the UKs early April 2020  lockdown period, 527 participants (311 older adults, mean age = 70.4 years; 216 chronic respiratory participants, mean age = 43.8 years) completed an online questionnaire assessing willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, perceptions of COVID-19, and intention to receive influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. A free text response (n=502) examined barriers and facilitators to uptake. The Behaviour Change Wheel informed the analysis of these responses, which were coded to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Behaviour change techniques (BCTs) were identified.

ResultsEighty-six percent of respondents want to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. This was positively correlated with the perception that COVID-19 will persist over time, and negatively associated with perceiving the media to have over-exaggerated the risk. The majority of barriers and facilitators were mapped onto the  beliefs about consequences TDF domain, with themes relating to personal health, health consequences to others, concerns of vaccine safety, and severity of COVID-19.

ConclusionsWillingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccination is currently high among high-risk individuals. Mass media interventions aimed at maximising vaccine uptake should utilise the BCTs of information about health, emotional, social and environmental consequences, and salience of consequences.

Statement of ContributionO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this subject?C_ST_ABSO_LIUptake of a vaccine for COVID-19 will be vital for controlling the pandemic, but the success of this strategy relies on public acceptance of the vaccine.
C_LIO_LIUptake of vaccinations and public confidence in vaccines has been falling in recent years.
C_LIO_LIEvidence suggests that 74% of the French population want to receive a COVID-19 vaccination.
C_LI

What does this study add?O_LIThis study found that 86% of our sample of high-risk participants in the UK are willing to receive a future vaccine for COVID-19.
C_LIO_LIThis study showed that perceived barriers and facilitators to uptake of the COVID-19 vaccination concentrated on the  beliefs about consequences TDF domain.
C_LIO_LIThis study suggests that the content of mass media interventions to improve vaccine uptake should focus on the BCTs of information about health, emotional, social and environmental consequences, and salience of consequences. These techniques should be pitched in relation to both self and, most importantly, to others.

21129,Head-to-head comparison of direct-input RT-PCR and RT-LAMP against RTqPCR on extracted RNA for rapid SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics,"Viral pandemics, such as Covid-19, pose serious threats to human societies. To control the spread of highly contagious viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, effective test-trace-isolate strategies require population-wide, systematic testing. Currently, RT-qPCR on extracted RNA is the only broadly accepted test for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, which bears the risk of supply chain bottlenecks, often exaggerated by dependencies on proprietary reagents. Here, we directly compare the performance of gold standard diagnostic RT-qPCR on extracted RNA to direct input RT-PCR, RT-LAMP and bead-LAMP on 384 primary patient samples collected from individuals with suspected Covid-19 infection. With a simple five minute crude sample inactivation step and one hour of total reaction time, we achieve assay sensitivities of 98% (direct RT-PCR), 93% (bead-LAMP) and 82% (RT-LAMP) for clinically relevant samples (diagnostic RT-qPCR Ct <35) and a specificity of >98%. For direct RT-PCR, our data further demonstrate a perfect agreement between real-time and end-point measurements, which allow a simple binary classification similar to the powerful visual readout of colorimetric LAMP assays. Our study provides highly sensitive and specific, easy to implement, rapid and cost-effective alternatives to diagnostic RT-qPCR tests.","Kellner, M. J.; Matl, M.; Ross, J.

13503,Efficacy of Tocilizumab in Covid 19: A metanalysis of case series studies,"Backgroundcharacteristic feature of COVID-19 during its progression in severity is the cytokine storm (via interleukin-6, IL-6) which is responsible for secondary acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [4]. Tocilizumab has an antagonist effect on the IL-6 receptor. With present review and metanalysis, we intend to update the current status on the clinical efficacy of tocilizumab in the treatment of Covid 19 infections in the published literature of case series.

MATERIALS AND METHODSThe following inclusion criteria were used: (i) case series studies (number of reported patients in each study equal to or greater than ten (ii) use of tocilizumab alone or in combination with standard of care therapy (iii) Covid 19 adult patients (iv) the studies with endpoints on all-cause mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, clinical improvements.

Data synthesis and statistical analysisMeta-analysis was performed using a random effects model and the DerSimonian and Laird method.

RESULTS18 were selected for the quantitative analysis (meta-analysis). 14 studies were retrospective and 4 were prospective

Meta-analysisThe mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with tocilizumab was 21% (251/1212) Asymmetric funnel plot in the cylindrical form due to publication bias

In conclusionthe present synthesis provide us useful insights with the other available evidence to refine our strategy and equip ourselves effectively with tocilizumab to defeat COVID 19 to save humanity.

LimitationsThe included studies utilized varied doses of tocilizumab (single or double), and duration drug availability issues emerged in some centers, which may have influenced both sample sizes and study designs.

9993,Effect of hydroxychloroquine on SARS-CoV-2 viral load in patients with COVID-19,"BackgroundSome studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an effective drug in reducing the in vitro replication of SARS-CoV-2. However, the in vivo effect of HCQ still unclear. This study aims to evaluate viral load clearance in patients with COVID-19 who underwent HCQ treatment in comparison with a control group that did not receive the drug.

MethodsThis prospective study comprised consecutive viral load measurements in patients with COVID-19 hospitalized with a moderate illness. Patients received 400 mg of HCQ every 12 hours for 10 days according to the medical decision. Nasal swab samples were collected at the 1st, 7th, and 14th days of the admission.

Results155 samples were collected from 66 patients with COVID-19 (60% female), with a median age of 58 years. The viral load between studied groups, assumed as a semiquantitative measure of cycle threshold (Ct) values, presented no significant difference within the three consecutive measures ({Delta}Ct) (p>0.05). We also analyzed the {Delta}Ct viral load at different intervals of sample collection ({Delta}t <7; 7-12 and >12 days) without significant differences at any {Delta}Ct (p>0.05).

ConclusionIn this study, we did not observe any change in viral load in vivo with the use of HCQ.

SummaryWe evaluate viral load clearance in patients with COVID-19 who took hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for treatment and those who not. Prospective viral load measurements have shown any change in viral load in vivo with the use of HCQ.","Faico-Filho, K. S.; Conte, D. D.; Souza Luna, L. K.; Carvalho, J. M. A.; Perosa, A. H.

19936,"Epidemiological feature, viral shedding, and antibody seroconversion among asymptomatic carriers and symptomatic/ presymptomatic COVID-19 patients","Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is pandemic. However, data concerning the epidemiological features, viral shedding, and antibody dynamics between asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers and COVID-19 patients remain controversial. We enrolled 193 subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Ningbo and Zhoushan, Zhejiang, China from January 21 to March 6, 2020. All subjects were followed up to monitor the dynamics of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Of those, 31 were asymptomatic carriers, 149 were symptomatic patients, and 14 were presymptomatic patients. Compared to symptomatic patients, asymptomatic carriers were younger and had higher levels of white blood cell and lymphocyte, lower levels of C-reactive protein and viral load, and shorter viral shedding duration. Conversion of IgM from positive to negative was shorter in asymptomatic carriers than in COVID-19 patients (P=0.030). The proportion of those persistently seropositive for IgG was higher in COVID-19 patients than in asymptomatic carriers (P=0.037). Viral load was higher in symptomatic than presymptomatic patients. Viral shedding was longer in presymptomatic patients than in asymptomatic carriers. Conclusively, asymptomatic carriers have a higher antiviral immunity to clear SARS-CoV-2 than do symptomatic patients and this antiviral immunity is not contributable to humoral immunity.","Chen, Y.; Li, P.; Ding, Y.; Liu, M.; Liu, L.; Yi, B.; Wu, T.; Dong, H.; Lao, X.; Ding, K.; Wang, H.; Zhang, D.; Tan, X.; Wang, Z.; Xu, G.; Cao, G.",2020-12-20,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.12.18.20248447,1,Guangwen Cao,Second Military Medical University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.18.20248447v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.18.20248447v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
11674,Short-term analysis and long-term predictions for the COVID-19 epidemic in a seasonality regime: the Italian case,"As of July 14th, COVID-19 has caused in Italy 34.984 deaths and 243.344 infection cases. Strict lockdown policies were necessary to contain the first outbreak wave and prevent the Italian healthcare system from being overwhelmed by patients requiring intensive care. After the progressive reopening, predicting how the epidemic situation will evolve is urgent and fundamental to control any future outbreak and prevent a second wave. We defined a time-varying optimization procedure to repeatedly calibrate the SIDARTHE model1 with data up to June 24th. The computed parameter distributions allow us to robustly analyse how the epidemic situation evolved and outline possible future scenarios. Assuming a seasonal regime for COVID-19, we tested different lockdown policies. Our results suggest that an intermittent lockdown where six """"open days"""" are allowed every other week may prevent a resurgent exponential outbreak and, at the same time, ease the societal burden of an extensive lockdown.","Simoni, G.; Fochesato, A.; Reali, F.; Giordano, G.; Domenici, E.; Marchetti, L.",2020-07-24,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.15.20154500,2,Luca Marchetti,"Fondazione The Microsoft Research - University of Trento, Centre for Computational and Systems Biology (COSBI)",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154500v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154500v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
20135,Renin-angiotensin system blockers and mortality in COVID-19: a territory-wide study from Hong Kong,"AimsRenin-angiotensin system blockers such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase the risk of adverse outcomes in COVID-19. In this study, the relationships between ACEI/ARB use and COVID-19 related mortality were examined.

MethodsConsecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR at the Hong Kong Hospital Authority between 1st January and 28th July 2020 were included.

ResultsThis study included 2774 patients. The mortality rate of the COVID-19 positive group was 1.5% (n=42). Those who died had a higher median age (82.3[76.5-89.5] vs. 42.9[28.2-59.5] years old; P<0.0001), more likely to have baseline comorbidities of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease (P<0.0001). They were more frequently prescribed ACEI/ARBs at baseline, and steroids, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin and hydroxychloroquine during admission (P<0.0001). They also had a higher white cell count, higher neutrophil count, lower platelet count, prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, higher D-dimer, troponin, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase (P<0.0001). Multivariate Cox regression showed that age, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, the use of ACEIs/ARBs and diuretics, and various laboratory tests remained significant predictors of mortality.

ConclusionsWe report that an association between ACEIs/ARBs with COVID-19 related mortality even after adjusting for cardiovascular and other comorbidities, as well as medication use. Patients with greater comorbidity burden and laboratory markers reflecting deranged clotting, renal and liver function, and increased tissue inflammation, and ACEI/ARB use have a higher mortality risk.

19784,The Impact of COVID-19 Lockdowns on the Behavior of Italian Citizens and Particulate Matter 10 and 2.5 Emissions in Lombardy,"Italy has been one of the first nations in the world to be heavily affected by the first wave of COVID-19. To date, it is among the first countries for both total cases of contagion and deaths. A wide range of containment measures have been adopted from February to December 2020 to mitigate the pandemic, including total lockdowns across the entire country. This research sets out to evaluate not only how these restrictions influenced Italian citizens consumption habits (such as online shopping, smart working and distance learning) but also the impact of lockdowns on the concentrations of particulate matter (PM) 10 and 2.5 in the Lombardy region. In particular, this survey is aimed at investigating the environmental sustainability of the new individual behaviors after the restrictions imposed by the Government in order to quantify their effects on particulate concentrations in Lombardy, the region most damaged by both COVID-19 and air pollution. Various tools and online platforms have been used to collect data, such as Google Trends, web portals providing statistical and demographic information (e.g. AdminStat Italia and ISTAT, which is the National Institute of Statistics), surveys conducted by the Department of Civil Protection, other scientific studies, and the most reliable national newspapers. Technical data on particulate matter was collected from the website of the Regional Agency for the Protection of the Environment (ARPA). To highlight any significant change, the average daily concentrations of PM10 and 2.5 during 2020 in all the provinces of Lombardy were compared with those of the previous year. The comparison between the mean values was made through the t-test. Two values were considered as statistically confident when t < 1.5. However, since the real significance of these thresholds is not easily determined, some margins of suspicious confidence have been kept. Finally, using Pearson and Spearman correlations, possible causal correlations between changes in citizens behavior and specific key events related to COVID-19 have been dealt with. The P-value threshold was indicatively set at 0.05. Microsoft Excel 2020 and Google Sheets were used as data analysis software. In conclusion, this paper showed a substantial ineffectiveness of total and partial lockdowns in reducing PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in Lombardy. Furthermore, it has been estimated that COVID-19 has significantly changed the consumption habits of Italian citizens, thus leading to both positive and negative results in terms of sustainability. For instance, a sharp rise in the usage of home delivery services is posing a potential additional threat to the environment at present. At the same time, a positive aspect of this change is the spread of digital literacy, as Italians got quickly acquainted with the most modern technologies for distant learning and smart working, thus paving the way for the establishment of energetically and environmentally sustainable policies throughout the country.","Rovetta, A.",2020-12-29,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.12.15.20248285,2,Alessandro Rovetta,Mensana srls; Redeev srl,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.15.20248285v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.15.20248285v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
3276,Suppression and Mitigation Strategies for Control of COVID-19 in New Zealand,"A standard SEIR-type compartment model, parameterised for New Zealand, was used to simulate the spread of Covid19 in New Zealand and to test the effectiveness of various control strategies. Control aims can be broadly categorised as either suppression or mitigation. Suppression aims to keep cases to an absolute minimum for as long as possible. Mitigation aims to allow a controlled outbreak to occur, with the aim of preventing significant overloads on healthcare systems and gradually allowing the population to develop herd immunity.

Both types of strategy are fraught with uncertainty. Suppression strategies can succeed in delaying an outbreak, but only for as long as such control measures can be sustained. Once controls are eased or restricted, an epidemic is likely to follow as no herd immunity has been acquired. The success or failure of mitigation strategies can depend sensitively on the timing and efficacy of control measures, and require the ability to bring rapidly growing outbreaks under immediate control when needed. This is as yet untested even for a combination of national interventions including case isolation, household quarantine, population-wide social distancing and closure of schools and universities.

Although there are disadvantages to both types of approach, suppression has the advantage of buying time until a vaccine and/or treatment become available and allowing NZ to learn from rapidly unfolding events in other countries. A combination of successful suppression, strong border measures, and widespread contact tracing and testing resulting in containment could allow periods when control measures can be relaxed, but only if cases are reduced to a handful.

Executive SummaryO_LISuppression strategies aim to keep the number of cases to an absolute minimum for as long as possible. This requires early and effective control interventions.
C_LIO_LISuppression can only delay an epidemic, not prevent it, but may buy enough time for a vaccine or treatment to become available.
C_LIO_LIMitigation strategies aim to control an epidemic so that herd immunity is acquired by the population without overwhelming healthcare systems.

Using a direct RT-PCR method with the Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene), the clinical sensitivity of the gargle was 95.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.2 to 98.3%) and was similar to the sensitivity of the ONPS (93.8%; 95% CI, 88.2 to 97.3%), despite significantly lower viral RNA concentration in gargles, as reflected by higher cycle threshold values. No single specimen type detected all COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was stable in gargles at room temperature for at least 7 days. The simplicity of this sampling method coupled with the accessibility of spring water are clear advantages in a pandemic situation where testing frequency, turnaround time and shortage of consumables and trained staff are critical elements.","Dumaresq, J.; Coutlee, F.; Dufresne, P.; Longtin, J.; Fafard, J.; Bestman-Smith, J.; Bergevin, M.

In this study, we found that certain patient sera and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) collected prior to the COVID-19 outbreak were cross-reactive to SARS-CoV-2 full-length Spike, S2 domain, and Nucleocapsid. However, their presence did not translate into neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Importantly, we detected serum IgG reactivity to common coronaviruses in the early sera of patients with severe COVID-19 before the appearance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

22392,Predictive Modeling of COVID-19 Case Growth Highlights Evolving Demographic Risk Factors in Tennessee and Georgia,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the need to understand the unique risk drivers that contribute to uneven morbidity and mortality in US communities. Addressing the community-specific social determinants of health that correlate with spread of SARS-CoV-2 provides an opportunity for targeted public health intervention to promote greater resilience to viral respiratory infections in the future.

Our work combined publicly available COVID-19 statistics with county-level social determinants of health information. Machine learning models were trained to predict COVID-19 case growth and understand the unique social, physical and environmental risk factors associated with higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Tennessee and Georgia counties. Model accuracy was assessed comparing predicted case counts to actual positive case counts in each county. The predictive models achieved a mean r-squared (R2) of 0.998 in both states with accuracy above 90% for all time points examined. Using these models, we tracked the social determinants of health, with a specific focus on demographics, that were strongly associated with COVID-19 case growth in Tennessee and Georgia counties. The demographic results point to dynamic racial trends in both states over time and varying, localized patterns of risk among counties within the same state.

Identifying the specific risk factors tied to COVID-19 case growth can assist public health officials and policymakers target regional interventions to mitigate the burden of future outbreaks and minimize long-term consequences including emergence or exacerbation of chronic diseases that are a direct consequence of infection.","Gray, J.

DBS are used by NHS for diagnosing HCV and by PHE for large scale HIV and Hepatitis C serosurveillance; the applicability of DBS based approaches to SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection is uncertain.

ObjectiveTo compare antibody detection in dried blood spot eluates using the Roche Elecsys (R) immunoassay (index test) with antibody detection in paired plasma samples, using the same assay (reference test).

SettingOne Police and one Fire & Rescue facility in England.

Participants195 participants within a larger sample COVID-19 serodiagnostics study of keyworkers, EDSAB-HOME.

Outcome MeasuresSensitivity and specificity of DBS (the index test) relative to plasma (the reference test), at an experimental cut-off; quality of DBS sample collected; estimates of relative sensitivity of DBS vs. plasma immunoassay in a larger population.

Results18/195 (9.2%) participants tested positive using plasma samples. DBS sample quality varied markedly by phlebotomist, and low sample volume significantly reduced immunoassay signals. Using a cut-off of ten median absolute deviations above the immunoassay result with negative samples, sensitivity and specificity of DBS were 89.0% (95% CI 67.2, 96.9%) and 100.0% (95% CI 97.9, 100%) respectively compared with using plasma. The limit of detection for DBS is about 30 times higher than for plasma.

ConclusionDBS use for SARS-CoV-2 serology, though feasible, is insensitive relative to immunoassays on plasma. Sample quality impacts on assay performance. Alternatives, including the collection of capillary blood samples, should be considered for screening programs.","Mulchandani, R.; Brown, B.; Brooks, T.; Semper, A.; Machin, N.; Linley, E.; Borrow, R.; Study Investigators, E.-H.; Wyllie, D.",2020-10-21,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.19.20215228,1,David Wyllie,Public Health England,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.20215228v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.20215228v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.jcv.2021.104739
15889,Temporal Changes in Clinical Practice with COVID-19 Hospitalized Patients: Potential Explanations for Better In-Hospital Outcomes,"Background/Aims: We reviewed demographic and clinical profiles, along with measures of hospital-based clinical practice to identify temporal changes in clinical practice that may have affected in-hospital outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Methods: Data consisted of sociodemographic and clinical data captured in University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) electronic medical record (EMR) systems, linked by common variables (deidentified). The analysis population included hospitalized patients (across 21 hospitals) with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 infection during the period March 14-August 31, 2020. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital mechanical ventilation/mortality. We compared temporal trends in patient characteristics, clinical practice, and hospital outcomes using 4 time-defined epochs for calendar year 2020: March 14-March 31 (epoch 1); April 1-May 15, (epoch 2), May 16-June 28 (epoch 3); and June 29-August 31 (epoch 4). We report unadjusted survival estimates, followed by propensity score analyses to adjust for differences in patient characteristics, to compare in-hospital outcomes of epoch 4 patients (recently treated) to epoch 1-3 patients (earlier treated). Results: Mean number of hospital admissions was 9.9 per day during epoch 4, which was ~2- to 3-fold higher than the earlier epochs. Presenting characteristics of the 1,076 COVID-19 hospitalized patients were similar across the 4 epochs, including mean age. The crude rate of mechanical ventilation/mortality was lower in epoch 4 patients (17%) than in epoch 1-3 patients (23% to 35%). When censoring for incomplete patient follow-up, the rate of mechanical ventilation/mortality was lower in epoch 4 patients (p<0.0001), as was the individual component of mechanical ventilation (p=0.0002) and mortality (p=0.02). In propensity score adjusted analyses, the in-hospital relative risk (RR) of mechanical ventilation/mortality was lower in epoch 4 patients (RR=0.67, 95% CI: 0.48, 0.93). For the outcome being discharged alive within 3, 5, or 7 days of admission, adjusted odds ranged from 1.6- to 1.7-fold higher among epoch 4 patients compared to earlier treated patients. The better outcomes in epoch 4 patients were principally observed in patients under the age of 75 years. Patient level dexamethasone use was 55.6% in epoch 4 compared to 15% or less of patients in the earlier epochs. Most patients across epochs received anticoagulation drugs (principally heparin). Overall steroid (81.7% vs. 54.3%, p<0.0001) and anticoagulation use (90.4% vs. 80.7%, p=0.0001) was more frequent on the day or day after hospitalization in epoch 4 patients compared to earlier treated patients. Conclusions: In our large system, recently treated hospitalized COVID-19 patients had lower rates of in-hospital mechanical ventilation/mortality and shorter length of hospital stay. Alongside of this was a change to early initiation of glucocorticoid therapy and anticoagulation. The extent to which the improvement in patient outcomes was related to changes in clinical practice remains to be established.","Kip, K. E.; Snyder, G.; Yealy, D. M.; Mellors, J.

6531,Covid-19 Pandemic in relation to levels of Pollution with PM2.5 and Ambient Salinity. An Environmental Wake-up Call,"INTRODUCTIONCovid-19 infection continues to be a source of great loss of life and global suffering, necessitating national lockdowns. There are however some countries and cities which appear to have contained the pandemic. Common to these countries are environmental factors including the levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) and ambient salinity.

METHODPM2.5 and ambient salinity were assessed in a number of cities, differentially affected by Covid-19 infection. The cities chosen to be assessed were divided into two groups. The first group included cities having significantly high rates of Covid-19 infection, while the second group consisted of coastal cities or small island countries, all of which have low rates of Covid-19 infection. Minimum and maximum levels of PM2.5 were obtained from the Air Quality Index, one month before and one month after statutory lockdown. Salinity levels were obtained from a study that assessed chloride ion wet deposition, a surrogate for ambient salinity.

RESULTSOne month prior to the statutory national lock-down or mandatory restrictions, there appear to be high levels of particulate matter, PM2.5 (min-max 67.4 - 118.7 AQI), in countries which had a high incidence of Covid-19 infection compared to lower levels in countries that have contained the infection (min-max 45.6 - 79.8) (p<0.046). One month after national restrictions there still appeared to be higher levels of particulate matter, PM2.5 (min-max 51 - 90.5 AQI), in countries which had a high incidence of Covid-19 infection compared to countries that have contained the infection (min-max 42.7 - 69.5 AQI) but this was not statistically significant.

There seemed to be an inverse relationship between Covid-19 infection and ambient salinity levels. Countries that were spared high Covid-19 infection rates, besides their geographical isolation, also have higher ambient salinity levels (124 - 617mgCl/m2/TAG) compared to salinity levels noted in countries with high Covid-19 rates of infection (28.4 - 162. mgCl/m2/TAG) (p<0.003).

CONCLUSIONHigh levels of PM2.5 in the presence of low ambient salinity may increase the risk of Covid-19 infection in the population. Addressing these two environmental factors may attenuate the severity of the pandemic.","Muscat Baron, Y.",2020-05-08,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.03.20087056,1,Yves Muscat Baron,"Mater Dei Hospital, Medical School of Malta",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20087056v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20087056v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
8115,Study Data Element Mapping: Feasibility of Defining Common Data Elements Across COVID-19 Studies,"BackgroundNumerous clinical studies are now underway investigating aspects of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to identify a selection of national and/or multicentre clinical COVID-19 studies in the United Kingdom to examine the feasibility and outcomes of documenting the most frequent data elements common across studies to rapidly inform future study design and demonstrate proof-of-concept for further subject-specific study data element mapping to improve research data management.

Methods25 COVID-19 studies were included. For each, information regarding the specific data elements being collected was recorded. Data elements collated were arbitrarily divided into categories for ease of visualisation. Elements which were most frequently and consistently recorded across studies are presented in relation to their relative commonality.

ResultsAcross the 25 studies, 261 data elements were recorded in total. The most frequently recorded 100 data elements were identified across all studies and are presented with relative frequencies. Categories with the largest numbers of common elements included demographics, admission criteria, medical history and investigations. Mortality and need for specific respiratory support were the most common outcome measures, but with specific studies including a range of other outcome measures.

ConclusionThe findings of this study have demonstrated that it is feasible to collate specific data elements recorded across a range of studies investigating a specific clinical condition in order to identify those elements which are most common among studies. These data may be of value for those establishing new studies and to allow researchers to rapidly identify studies collecting data of potential use hence minimising duplication and increasing data re-use and interoperability","Mathewson, P.; Gordon, B.; Snowley, K.; Fennessy, C.; Denniston, A.; Sebire, N.",2020-05-26,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.05.19.20106641,1,Neil Sebire,Great Ormond Street Hospital and ICH London,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20106641v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20106641v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
24121,Viability RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2: a step forward to solve the infectivity quandary,"BackgroundIsolation, contact tracing and restrictions on social movement are being globally implemented to prevent and control onward spread of SARS-CoV-2, even though the infection risk modelled on RNA detection by RT-qPCR remains biased as viral shedding and infectivity are not discerned. Thus, we aimed to develop a rapid viability RT-qPCR procedure to infer SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in clinical specimens and environmental samples.

MethodsWe screened monoazide dyes and platinum compounds as viability molecular markers on five SARS-CoV-2 RNA targets. A platinum chloride-based viability RT-qPCR was then optimized using genomic RNA, and inactivated SARS-CoV-2 particles inoculated in buffer, stool, and urine. Our results were finally validated in nasopharyngeal swabs from persons who tested positive for COVID-19 and in wastewater samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

FindingsWe established a rapid viability RT-qPCR that selectively detects potentially infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in complex matrices. In particular, the confirmed positivity of nasopharyngeal swabs following the viability procedure suggests their potential infectivity, while the complete prevention of amplification in wastewater indicated either non-infectious particles or free RNA.

InterpretationThe viability RT-qPCR approach provides a more accurate ascertainment of the infectious viruses detection and it may complement analyses to foster risk-based investigations for the prevention and control of new or re-occurring outbreaks with a broad application spectrum.

20755,The Relationship between Democracy embracement and COVID-19 reported casualties worldwide,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 toll of cases and deaths followed an uneven pattern across the world. The literature has partly explained the observed discrepancy between the different countries by country-specific and systemic patterns worldwide. In this study, we propose an additional explanation that the magnitude of COVID-19 toll reported to the WHO could be influenced by the level of free speech and Democracy in the reporting countries.

MethodsWe constructed a longitudinal dataset including the daily COVID-19 count of cases and deaths worldwide and each countrys respective score on the Freedom in the World index. We applied two Generalized Estimating Equation models to investigate if a countrys reported toll count of COVID-19 cases and deaths is related to that countrys freedom level. We controlled for factors identified in the current literature to affect the pandemics spread.

ResultsA countrys score on the Freedom In the World Index was associated with its reported COVID-19 cases count (57028.43, 95% CI 985.3619 - 113071.5, P= 0.0461) and deaths count (3473.273, 95% CI1217.12-5729.42, P=.002). Also, despite having almost equal shares of the worlds population, countries at the bottom category of the Freedom index reported 21% and 11% of the COVID-19 toll cases and death counts reported by countries of highest scores on the index, respectively.

ConclusionsThe known magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemics morbidity and mortality appears to be as transparent as the reporting countries uphold free speech and Democracy. This pattern could potentially misguide international aid and global vaccine distribution plans.","Hussein, M. R.; Alsulaiman, T.; Habib, M. F.; Awad, E. A.; Morsi, I.; Herbold, J.

24385,Some Mathematics for the Method of Pooled PCR Test,"At the time of the worldwide COVID-19 disaster, the author learned about the pooled (RT-) PCR test from the news. From the common sense of individual tests, the idea of mixing multiple samples seems taboo, however in fact many samples can be tested with a smaller number of tests by the method. As a retired researcher of mathematical engineering, the author was deeply interested in the idea and absorbed in the mathematical formulation and intensive analysis of the method.

Later, he found that the original basic equation was already proposed in the old (1943) treatise [1] and so many related research works have been done and available as materials on the web [2], although many of those seem to be based on qualitative or intuitive analysis. In that sense, some of the analysis here seems to be already known in the field, but some results might be novel, such as boundary conditions, derivation of limit values, estimation of infection rate and adaptive optimization scheme of pool test, strict extension to multi-stage pool test, and explicit derivation of asymptotic approximate solutions of optimal pooling number and achieved efficiency measure, etc.

In any case, he decided to put it together here as a material rather than a formal treatise, hoping that the results here would be useful for deeper mathematical insights into and better understanding of the pool inspection, and also in its actual practice.","Otsu, N.",2021-04-04,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.03.26.21254430,2,Nobuyuki Otsu,AIST,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.26.21254430v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.26.21254430v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
8094,Comparing dynamics and determinants of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions among health care workers of adult and pediatric settings in central Paris,"BackgroundFrom the start of the pandemic, health-care workers (HCW) have paid a heavy toll to the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak.

ObjectivesTo describe the dynamics and determinants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in HCW.

DesignProspective observational study conducted from February 24th until April 10th, 2020.

SettingComparison of a 1,500-bed adult and a 600-bed pediatric setting of a tertiary-care university hospital located in central Paris.

ParticipantsAll symptomatic HCW screened for SARS-CoV-2 on a nasopharyngeal swab.

MeasurementsHCW screened positive were prospectively questioned on their profession, symptoms, occupational and non-occupational exposures to SARS-CoV-2.

ResultsAmong 1344 symptomatic HCW tested, 373 were positive (28%) and 336 (90%) corresponding questionnaires were completed. Three hospitalizations and no death were reported. Most HCW (70%) had patient-facing occupational activities (22% in COVID-19 dedicated units). The total number of HCW cases peaked on March 23rd, then decreased slowly, concomitantly with a continuous increase of compliance to preventive measures (including universal medical masking and personal protective equipment (PPE) for direct care to COVID-19 patients). Attack rates were of 3.2% and 2.3% in the adult and pediatric setting, respectively (p=0.0022). In the adult setting, HCW more frequently reported exposure to COVID-19 patients without PPE (25% versus 15%, p=0.046). Report of contacts with children attending out-of-home care facilities dramatically decreased over the study period.

LimitationsLack of COVID-19 negative controls and recall bias.

ConclusionUniversal masking, reinforcement of hand hygiene, and PPE with medical masks for patients care allowed protection of HCW and containment of the outbreak. Residual transmissions were related to persistent exposures with undiagnosed patients or colleagues and not to contacts with children attending out-of-home care facilities.","Contejean, A.; Leporrier, J.; Canoui, E.; Alby-Laurent, F.; Lafont, E.; Beaudeau, L.; Parize, P.; Lecieux, F.; Greffet, A.; Cheron, G.; Gauzit, R.; Fourgeaud, J.; L'honneur, A.-S.; Treluyer, J.-M.; Charlier, C.; Casetta, A.; Frange, P.; Leruez-Ville, M.; Rozenberg, F.; Lortholary, O.; Kerneis, S.",2020-05-26,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.19.20106427,1,Solen Kerneis,"Equipe Mobile d\'Infectiologie, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20106427v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20106427v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

To assess whether gout and / or RA are risk factors for death with COVID-19.

MethodsWe used data from the UK Biobank. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression was employed in the following analyses: Analysis A, to test for association between gout or RA and COVID-19 diagnosis (n=473,139); Analysis B, to test for association between gout or RA and death with COVID-19 in a case-control cohort of people who died or survived with COVID-19 (n=2,059); Analysis C, to test for association with gout or RA and death with COVID-19 in the entire UK Biobank cohort (n=473,139)

ResultsRA, but not gout, associated with COVID-19 diagnosis in analysis A. Neither RA nor gout associated with risk of death in the COVID-19-diagnosed group in analysis B. However RA associated with risk of death related to COVID-19 using the UK Biobank cohort in analysis C independent of comorbidities and other measured risk factors (OR=1.9 [95% CI 1.2 ; 3.0]). Gout was not associated with death related to COVID-19 in the same UK Biobank analysis (OR=1.2 [95% CI 0.8 ; 1.7]).

ConclusionRheumatoid arthritis is a risk factor for death with COVID-19 using the UK Biobank cohort. These findings require replication in larger data sets that also allow inclusion of a wider range of factors.

Key messagesInformation on the risk of death from COVID-19 for people with gout and rheumatoid arthritis is scarce.

In an analysis of the UK Biobank there is an increased risk of death related to COVID-19 for people with rheumatoid arthritis independent of included co-morbidities, but not gout.

15217,Clinical evolution of COVID-19 during pregnancy at different altitudes: a population-based study,"BackgroundThe impact of influenza and various types of coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) on pregnancy has been reported. However, the current pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 continues to reveal important data for understanding its behavior in pregnant women.

MethodsWe analyzed the records of 326,586 non-pregnant women of reproductive age and 7,444 pregnant women with no other risk factor who also had a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result to estimate adjusted prevalence (aP) and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) of COVID-19 and its requirement of hospitalization, intubation, ICU admission and case-fatality rates. Adjustment was done through Poisson regressions for age and altitude of residence and birth. Generalized binomial models were used to generate probability plots to display how each outcome varied across ages and altitudes.

ResultsPregnancy was independently associated with a 15% higher probability of COVID-19 (aPR: 1.15), a 116% higher probability of its following admission (aPR: 2.169) and a 127% higher probability of ICU admission (aPR: 2.275). Also, pregnancy was associated with 84.2% higher probability of developing pneumonia (aPR: 1.842) and a 163% higher probability of its following admission (aPR: 2.639). There were no significant differences in COVID-19 case-fatality rates between pregnant and non pregnant women (1.178, 95% CI: 0.68-1.67).

ConclusionPregnancy was associated with a higher probability of COVID-19, developing of pneumonia, hospitalization, and ICU admission.

14062,Disease-dependent interaction policies to support health and economic outcomes during the COVID-19 epidemic,"Lockdowns and stay-at-home orders have partially mitigated the spread of Covid-19. However, the indiscriminate nature of mitigation -- applying to all individuals irrespective of disease status -- has come with substantial socioeconomic costs. Here, we explore how to leverage the increasing reliability and scale of both molecular and serological tests to balance transmission risks with economic costs involved in responding to Covid-19 epidemics. First, we introduce an optimal control approach that identifies personalized interaction rates according to an individuals test status; such that infected individuals isolate, recovered individuals can elevate their interactions, and activity of susceptible individuals varies over time. Critically, the extent to which susceptible individuals can return to work depends strongly on isolation efficiency. As we show, optimal control policies can yield mitigation policies with similar infection rates to total shutdown but lower socioeconomic costs. However, optimal control policies can be fragile given mis-specification of parameters or mis-estimation of the current disease state. Hence, we leverage insights from the optimal control solutions and propose a feedback control approach based on monitoring of the epidemic state. We utilize genetic algorithms to identify a  switching policy such that susceptible individuals (both PCR and serological test negative) return to work after lockdowns insofar as recovered fraction is much higher than the circulating infected prevalence. This feedback control policy exhibits similar performance results to optimal control, but with greater robustness to uncertainty. Overall, our analysis shows that test-driven improvements in isolation efficiency of infectious individuals can inform disease-dependent interaction policies that mitigate transmission while enhancing the return of individuals to pre-pandemic economic activity.","Li, G.; Shivam, S.; Hochberg, M.

17311,"Declining prevalence of antibody positivity to SARS-CoV-2: a community study of 365,000 adults","BackgroundThe prevalence and persistence of antibodies following a peak SARS-CoV-2 infection provides insights into its spread in the community, the likelihood of reinfection and potential for some level of population immunity.

MethodsPrevalence of antibody positivity in England, UK (REACT2) with three cross-sectional surveys between late June and September 2020. 365104 adults used a self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test for IgG. A laboratory comparison of LFIA results to neutralization activity in panel of sera was performed.

ResultsThere were 17,576 positive tests over the three rounds. Antibody prevalence, adjusted for test characteristics and weighted to the adult population of England, declined from 6.0% [5.8, 6.1], to 4.8% [4.7, 5.0] and 4.4% [4.3, 4.5], a fall of 26.5% [-29.0, -23.8] over the three months of the study. There was a decline between rounds 1 and 3 in all age groups, with the highest prevalence of a positive result and smallest overall decline in positivity in the youngest age group (18-24 years: -14.9% [-21.6, -8.1]), and lowest prevalence and largest decline in the oldest group (75+ years: -39.0% [-50.8, -27.2]); there was no change in antibody positivity between rounds 1 and 3 in healthcare workers (+3.45% [-5.7, +12.7]).

The decline from rounds 1 to 3 was largest in those who did not report a history of COVID-19, (-64.0% [-75.6, -52.3]), compared to -22.3% ([-27.0, -17.7]) in those with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed on PCR.

DiscussionThese findings provide evidence of variable waning in antibody positivity over time such that, at the start of the second wave of infection in England, only 4.4% of adults had detectable IgG antibodies using an LFIA. Antibody positivity was greater in those who reported a positive PCR and lower in older people and those with asymptomatic infection. These data suggest the possibility of decreasing population immunity and increasing risk of reinfection as detectable antibodies decline in the population.","Ward, H.; Cooke, G.; Atchison, C.

20744,Cerebrospinal fluid in COVID-19 neurological complications: no cytokine storm or neuroinflammation.,"BACKGROUNDNeurological complications occur in COVID-19. We aimed to examine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of COVID-19 subjects with neurological complications and determine presence of neuroinflammatory changes implicated in pathogenesis.

METHODSCross-sectional study of CSF neuroinflammatory profiles from 18 COVID-19 subjects with neurological complications categorized by diagnosis (stroke, encephalopathy, headache) and illness severity (critical, severe, moderate, mild). COVID-19 CSF was compared with CSF from healthy, infectious and neuroinflammatory disorders and stroke controls (n=82). Cytokines (IL-6, TNF, IFN{gamma}, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A), inflammation and coagulation markers (high-sensitivity-C Reactive Protein [hsCRP], ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, Factor VIII) and neurofilament light chain (NF-L), were quantified. SARS-CoV2 RNA and SARS-CoV2 IgG and IgA antibodies in CSF were tested with RT-PCR and ELISA.

RESULTSCSF from COVID-19 subjects showed a paucity of neuroinflammatory changes, absence of pleocytosis or specific increases in pro-inflammatory markers or cytokines (IL-6, ferritin, or D-dimer). Anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies in CSF of COVID-19 subjects (77%) were observed despite no evidence of SARS-CoV2 viral RNA. A similar increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF, IL-12p70) and IL-10 in CSF of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 stroke subjects was observed compared to controls. CSF-NF-L was elevated in subjects with stroke and critical COVID-19. CSF-hsCRP was present almost exclusively in COVID-19 cases.

CONCLUSIONThe paucity of neuroinflammatory changes in CSF of COVID-19 subjects and lack of SARS-CoV2 RNA do not support the presumed neurovirulence of SARS-CoV2 or neuroinflammation in pathogenesis of neurological complications in COVID-19. Elevated CSF-NF-L indicates neuroaxonal injury in COVID-19 cases. The role of CSF SARS-CoV2 IgG antibodies is still undetermined.

18734,Systematic evaluation of transcriptomic disease risk and diagnostic biomarker overlap between COVID-19 and tuberculosis: a patient-level meta-analysis,"BackgroundThe novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has increased the burden on healthcare systems already strained by a high incidence of tuberculosis (TB) as co-infection and dual presentation are occurring in syndemic settings. We aimed to understand the interaction between these diseases by profiling COVID-19 gene expression signatures on RNA-sequencing data from TB-infected individuals.

MethodsWe performed a systematic review and patient-level meta-analysis by querying PubMed and pre-print servers to derive eligible COVID-19 gene expression signatures from human whole blood (WB), PBMCs or BALF studies. A WB influenza dataset served as a control respiratory disease signature. Three large TB RNA-seq datasets, comprising multiple cohorts from the UK and Africa and consisting of TB patients across the disease spectrum, were chosen to profile these signatures. Putative """"COVID-19 risk scores"""" were generated for each sample in the TB datasets using the TBSignatureProfiler package. Risk was stratified by time to TB diagnosis in progressors and contacts of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB. An integrative analysis between TB and COVID-19 single-cell RNA-seq data was performed and a population-level meta-analysis was conducted to identify shared gene ontologies between the diseases and their relative enrichment in COVID-19 disease severity states.

Results35 COVID-19 gene signatures from nine eligible studies comprising 98 samples were profiled on TB RNA-seq data from 1181 samples from 853 individuals. 25 signatures had significantly higher COVID-19 risk in active TB (ATB) compared with latent TB infection (p <0{middle dot}005), 13 of which were validated in two independent datasets. FCN1- and SPP1-expressing macrophages enriched in BALF during severe COVID-19 were identified in circulation during ATB. Shared perturbed ontologies included antigen presentation, epigenetic regulation, platelet activation, and ROS/RNS production were enriched with increasing COVID-19 severity. Finally, we demonstrate that the overlapping transcriptional responses may complicate development of blood-based diagnostic signatures of co-infection.

InterpretationOur results identify shared dysregulation of immune responses in COVID-19 and TB as a dual risk posed by co-infection to COVID-19 severity and TB disease progression. These individuals should be followed up for TB in the months subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.","Sheerin, D.; Abhimanyu, A.; Wang, X.; Johnson, W.

6922,Brazil Health Care System preparation against COVID-19,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease outbreak from 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a highly contagious virus that claimed thousands of lives around the world and disrupted the health system in many countries. The assessment of emergency capacity in every country is a necessary part of the COVID-19 response efforts. Thus, it is extremely recommended to evaluate the health care system to prepare the country to tackle COVID-19 challenges.

Methods and FindingsA retrospective and ecological study was performed with data retrieved from the public national healthcare database (DATASUS). Numbers of intensive care unit and infirmary beds, general or intensivists physicians, nurses, nursing technicians, and ventilators from each Regional Health Unity were extracted, and the beds per health professionals and ventilators per population rates were assessed. The accessibility to health services was also performed using a spatial overlay approach to verify regions that lack assistance. It was found that Brazil lacks equity, integrity, and may struggle to assist with high complexity for the COVID-19 patients in many regions of the country.

ConclusionsBrazils health system is insufficient to tackle the COVID-19 in some regions of the country where the coronavirus may be responsible for high rates of morbidity and mortality.","Luis Silva, L.; Dutra, A.

25146,Primary care and point-of-care testing during a pandemic: Clinician's perspectives on integrating rapid testing for COVID-19 into the primary care pathway,"BackgroundReal-world evidence to support the adoption of SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care (POC) tests in primary care is limited. As the first point of contact of the health system for most patients, POC testing can potentially support general practitioners (GPs) quickly identify infectious and non-infectious individuals to rapidly inform patient triaging, clinical management, and safely restore more in-person services.

ObjectivesTo explore the potential role of SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care testing in primary care services.

DesignA qualitative study using an inductive thematic analysis.

Setting21 general practices located across three regions in England.

ResultsThree major themes were identified related to POC test implementation in primary care: (1) Insights into SARS-CoV-2 POC tests; (2) System and organisational factors; and (3) Practice-level service delivery strategies. Thematic subcategories included involvement in rapid testing, knowledge and perception of the current POC testing landscape, capacity for testing, economic concerns, resource necessities, perception of personal risk and safety, responsibility for administering the test, and targeted testing strategies.

ConclusionGPs knowledge of POC tests influences their degree of trust, uncertainty, and their perception of risk of POC test use. Concerns around funding, occupational exposure, and workload play a crucial role in GPs hesitation to provide POC testing services. These concerns could potentially be addressed with government funding, the use of targeted testing, and improved triaging strategies to limit testing to essential patient cohorts.","Kierkegaard, P.; Hicks, T.; Yang, Y.; Lee, J.; Hayward, G.; Turner, P.

23159,RT-RC-PCR: a novel and highly scalable next-generation sequencing method for simultaneous detection of SARS-COV-2 and typing variants of concern,"We describe a novel assay method: reverse-transcription reverse-complement polymerase chain reaction (RT-RC-PCR), which rationalises reverse transcription and NGS library preparation into a single closed tube reaction. By simplifying the analytical process and cross-contamination risks, RT-RC-PCR presents disruptive scalability and economy while using NGS and LIMS infrastructure widely available across health service, institutional and commercial laboratories.

We present a validation of RT-RC-PCR for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by NGS. The limit of detection is comparable to real-time RT-PCR, and no obvious difference in sensitivity was detected between extracted nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) RNA and native saliva samples.

The end point measurement of RT-RC-PCR is NGS of amplified sequences within the SARS-CoV-2 genome; we demonstrated its capacity to detect different variants using amplicons containing delH69-V70 and N501Y, both of which emerged in the UK Variant of Concern B.1.1.7 in 2020.

In summary, RT-RC-PCR has potential to facilitate accurate mass testing at disruptive scale and cost, with concurrent detection of variants of concern.","Mattocks, C. J.; Ward, D.; Mackay, D.

24388,Analyzing the Global Impact of COVID-19 Vaccination Progress: A Result-oriented Storytelling Approach,"The next big step in combating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic will be gaining widespread acceptance of a vaccination campaign for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but achieving high uptake need proper understandings. Many health professionals, researchers, statisticians, and programmers to track the viruses spread in different parts of the world have used various methods. However, the proliferation of vaccines produced by talented scientists around the world has sparked a strong desire to extract meaningful insights from available data. Until now, several vaccines against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been approved and are being distributed worldwide in various regions. This study aims to report the detailed data analysis and result-oriented storytelling of the COVID-19 vaccination program of different countries across the globe. To analyze the vaccination trend globally this research utilized two different open datasets provided by ourworldindata.org and worldometers.info. An exploratory data analysis (EDA) with interactive data visualization using various python libraries was conducted, and the results are presented in this article to better understand the impact of ongoing vaccination programs around the world. Apart from the valuable insights gained from the data of various countries, this investigation also included a comparison of the number of confirmed and death cases before and after vaccination to determine the efficacy of each vaccine in each country. The results show that a large number of people are still undecided about whether or not to get a COVID-19 vaccine, despite the viruss continued devastating effects on communities. Overall, our findings contribute to ongoing research aimed at informing policy on how to persuade the unvaccinated to be vaccinated.","Dey, S. K.; Rahman, D. M. M.; Siddiqi, D. U.

22564,Effectiveness of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions on Child and Staff COVID-19 Cases in US Summer Camps,"BackgroundMost camps remained closed during Summer 2020, due to concerns regarding child transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and limited information about the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) within child congregate settings.

MethodsWe surveyed US camps about on-site operations, camper and staff demographics, COVID-19 cases amongst campers and staff, and NPI usage as related to pre-camp quarantines, facial coverings, physical distancing, cleaning, and facility modifications. For all NPIs, save quarantines, responses were provided on a 5-point Likert scale format.

ResultsWithin 486 on-site camps, a range of NPIs were instituted, most often related to reduced camper interactions, staff face coverings, cleaning, and hand hygiene. Camper facial coverings were less common, with campers always wearing masks at [~]34% of the camps. Approximately 15% of camps reported 1+ confirmed COVID-19 case in either campers or staff, with three camps reporting a COVID outbreak. In both single and multi-NPI analyses, the risk of COVID-19 cases was lowest when campers always wore facial coverings. While less effective, constant use of staff facial coverings and targeted physical distancing measures, but not pre-camp quarantine, also reduced COVID-19 risks.

ConclusionsWe found constant facial coverings, especially for campers, and targeted physical distancing measures to reduce risks of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within summer camps. Our findings provide valuable guidance for future operations of camp and other child congregate settings with regard to efficient and effective NPI usage to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Whats Known on This SubjectApproximately 82% of US overnight camps did not open during Summer 2020 due to concerns regarding childrens ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2. Camps that did operate during this time instituted varied non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, with little information available on the effectiveness of these NPIs within child congregate settings. Large population-based studies are needed to improve our understanding of the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst children and their caregivers and to determine whether and to what degree child congregate programs can safely open during the pandemic.

What This Study AddsOur study, the largest survey of COVID-19 cases in child congregate settings at the national level, provides new information on the relative effectiveness of NPIs on mitigating COVID cases among children and staff within camp settings. We showed COVID-19 case rates in campers and staff to be low relative to corresponding case rates in the US and found constant camper facial coverings to be the most effective risk reduction method for SARS-CoV-2 transmission within camps. While less effective, constant use of staff facial coverings and targeted physical distancing measures, but not pre-camp quarantines, were also shown to reduce COVID-19 risks. Our findings has important implications for child congregate settings, helping to guide their successful opening and operation.","Suh, H.

16203,The excess insulin requirement in severe COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis is related to the severity of respiratory failure and pre-existing diabetes.,"ObjectiveSevere COVID-19 has been anecdotally associated with high insulin requirements. It has been proposed that this may be driven by a direct diabetogenic effect of the virus that is unique to SARS-CoV-2, but evidence to support this is limited. To explore this, we compared insulin requirements in patients with severe COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis.

Research DesignRetrospective cohort study of patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to our intensive care unit between March and June 2020. A historical control cohort of non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis patients was identified from routinely collected audit data.

ResultsInsulin requirements were similar in patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis after adjustment for pre-existing diabetes and severity of respiratory failure.

ConclusionsIn this single center study, we could not find evidence of a unique diabetogenic effect of COVID-19. We suggest that high insulin requirements in this disease relate to its propensity to cause severe respiratory failure in patients with pre-existing metabolic disease.","Lockhart, S.; Griffiths, H.; Petrisor, B.; Usman, A.; Calvo-Latorre, J.; Heales, L.; Bansiya, V.; Mahroof, R.; Conway Morris, A.",2020-10-06,Intensive Care And Critical Care Medicine,10.1101/2020.10.03.20206284,1,Andrew Conway Morris,University of Cambridge,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.03.20206284v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.03.20206284v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1002/edm2.228
12103,Model-free estimation of COVID-19 transmission dynamics from a complete outbreak,"New Zealand had 1499 cases of COVID-19 before eliminating transmission of the virus. Extensive contract tracing during the outbreak has resulted in a dataset of epidemiologically linked cases. This data contains useful information about the transmission dynamics of the virus, its dependence on factors such as age, and its response to different control measures.

We use Monte-Carlo network construction techniques to provide an estimate of the number of secondary cases for every individual infected during the outbreak. We then apply standard statistical techniques to quantify differences between groups of individuals.

Children under 10 years old are significantly under-represented in the case data. Children infected fewer people on average and had a lower secondary attack rate in comparison to adults and the elderly. Imported cases infected fewer people on average and had a lower secondary attack rate than domestically acquired cases. Superspreading is a significant contributor to the epidemic dynamics, with 20% of cases among adults responsible for 65-85% of transmission. Asymptomatic cases infected fewer individuals than clinical cases. Serial intervals are approximately normally distributed ( = 5.0 days,{sigma} = 5.7 days). Early isolation and quarantine of cases reduced secondary transmission rates.

Border controls and strong social distancing measures, particularly when targeted at superspreading, play a significant role in reducing the spread of COVID-19.","James, A.; Plank, M.

12761,Early clinical characteristics of Covid-19: scoping review,"BackgroundThe Coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has spread rapidly across the globe. Accurate clinical characterisation studies conducted early in the pandemic are essential to informing research, diagnosis and clinical management efforts. In this scoping review we identify the clinical characteristics of patients admitted to hospital in the early months of the pandemic, focusing on symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings, and clinical outcomes.

MethodsA scoping review. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health databases were searched for studies published from January 1st 2020 to April 28th 2020. Studies which reported on at least 100 hospitalised patients with covid-19 of any age were included.

ResultsOf 1,249 studies identified through the search 78 studies were eligible for inclusion; one randomized control trial and 77 observational studies presenting data on 77,443 patients admitted with covid-19. Most studies were conducted in China (82%), 9% in the US and 10% in Europe and two studies were set in more than one country. No studies included patients from low and middle income countries. Coagulopathy was underrecognised as a complication in the early months of the pandemic. Use of corticosteroids varied widely, and the use of anticoagulants was reported in only one study. Fever, cough and dyspnoea are less common in older adults; gastrointestinal symptoms, as the only presenting feature was underrecognised. The most common laboratory finding was lymphocytopenia. Inflammatory biomarkers were commonly elevated, including C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. Typical computed tomography findings include bilateral infiltrates however imaging may be normal in early disease. Data on clinical characteristics in children and vulnerable populations were limited.

ConclusionsClinical characterisation studies from early in the pandemic indicated that covid-19 is a multisystem disease, with biomarkers indicating inflammation and coagulopathy. However, early data collection on symptoms and clinical outcomes did not consistently reflect this wide spectrum. Corticosteroid use varied widely, and anticoagulants were rarely used. Clinicians should remain vigilant to the possibility of covid-19 in patients presenting without fever, cough and dyspnoea, particularly in older adults. Further characterisation studies in different at-risk populations is needed.

4409,Smoking is Associated with COVID-19 Progression: A Meta-Analysis,"ObjectiveTo determine the association between smoking and progression of COVID-19.

DesignA meta-analysis of 12 published papers.

Data SourcePubMed database was searched on April 6, 2020.

Eligibility criteria and data analysisWe included studies reporting smoking behavior of COVID-19 patients and progression of disease. Search terms included """"smoking"""", """"smoker*"""", """"characteristics"""", """"risk factors"""", """"outcomes"""", and """"COVID-19"""", """"COVID"""", """"coronavirus"""", """"sar cov-2"""", """"sar cov 2"""". There were no language limitations. One author extracted information for each study, screened the abstract or the full text, with questions resolved through discussion among both authors. A random effects meta-analysis was applied.

Main Outcome MeasuresThe study outcome was progression of COVID-19 among people who already had the disease.

ResultsWe identified 12 papers with a total of 9,025 COVID-19 patients, 878 (9.7%) with severe disease and 495 with a history of smoking (5.5%). The meta-analysis showed a significant association between smoking and progression of COVID-19 (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.49-3.39, p=0.001). Limitations in the 12 papers suggest that the actual risk of smoking may be higher.

ConclusionsSmoking is a risk factor for progression of COVID-19, with smokers having higher odds of COVID-19 progression than never smokers.

22983,Shifting research priorities in maternal and child health in the COVID-19 pandemic era in India: a renewed focus on systems strengthening,"BackgroundThe remarkable progress seen in maternal and child health (MCH) in India over the past two decades has been impacted by setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to undertake a rapid assessment to identify key priorities for public health research in MCH in India within the context and aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsA web-based survey was developed to identify top research priorities in MCH. It consisted of 26 questions on six broad domains: vaccine preventable diseases, outbreak preparedness, primary healthcare integration, maternal health, neonatal health, and infectious diseases. Key stakeholders were invited to participate between September and November 2020. Participants assigned importance on a 5-point Likert scale, and assigned overall ranks to each sub-domain research priority. Descriptive statistics were used to examine Likert scale responses, and a ranking analysis was done to obtain an """"average ranking score"""" and identify the top research priority under each domain.

ResultsAmongst the 84 respondents, 37% were public-health researchers, 25% healthcare providers, 20% academic faculty and 13% were policy makers. Across the six domains, most respondents considered conducting research on systems strengthening as extremely important. The highest ranked research priorities were strengthening the public sector workforce (vaccine preventable diseases), enhancing public-health surveillance networks (outbreak preparedness), nutrition support through community workers (primary care integration), encouraging at least 4-8 antenatal visits (maternal health), neonatal resuscitation to reduce birth asphyxia (neonatal health) and pediatric and maternal screening and treatment of tuberculosis (infectious diseases). Common themes identified through open-ended questions were also systems strengthening priorities across domains.

ConclusionsThe overall focus for research priorities in MCH in India during the COVID-19 pandemic is on strengthening existing services and service delivery, rather than novel research. Our results highlight pivotal steps within the roadmap for advancing and sustaining maternal and child health gains during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Mehta, K.; Zodpey, S.; Banerjee, P.; Pocius, S.

13027,Rapid systematic review of the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing on saliva compared to nasopharyngeal swabs,"BackgroundNasopharyngeal sampling has been the standard collection method for COVID-19 testing. Due to its invasive nature and risk of contamination for health care workers who collect the sample, non-invasive and safe sampling methods like saliva, can be used alternatively.

MethodsA rapid systematic search was performed in PubMed and medRxiv, with the last retrieval on June 6th, 2020. Studies were included if they compared saliva with nasopharyngeal sampling for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the same RT-qPCR applied on both types of samples. The primary outcome of interest was the relative sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing on saliva versus nasopharyngeal samples (used as the comparator test). A secondary outcome was the proportion of nasopharyngeal-positive patients that tested also positive on a saliva sample.

ResultsEight studies were included comprising 1070 saliva-nasopharyngeal sample pairs allowing assessment of the first outcome. The relative sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing on saliva versus nasopharyngeal samples was 0.97 (95% CI=0.92-1.02). The second outcome incorporated patient data (n=257) from four other studies (n=97 patients) pooled with four studies from the first outcome (n=160 patients). This resulted in a pooled proportion of nasopharyngeal positive cases that was also positive on saliva of 86% (95% CI=77-93%).

DiscussionSaliva could potentially be considered as an alternative sampling method when compared to nasopharyngeal swabs. However, studies included in this review often were small and involved inclusion of subjects with insufficient information on clinical covariates. Most studies included patients who were symptomatic (78%, 911/1167). Therefore, additional and larger studies should be performed to verify the relative performance of saliva in the context of screening of asymptomatic populations and contact-tracing.","Peeters, E.; Kaur Dhillon Ajit Singh, S.; Vandesompele, J.; Mestdagh, P.; Hutse, V.; Arbyn, M.",2020-08-06,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.05.20168716,1,Marc Arbyn,Sciensano,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168716v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168716v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

The number of new diabetes cases directly attributed to lockdown were calculated using population attributable risk. Unit cost estimates of the additional burden on primary care and the cost of complications to secondary care were taken from the literature.

ResultsFrom 9 million older ([&ge;]70yrs) people living in England, 2.1 million could be defined as pre-diabetic (glycated haemoglobin 42<48 mmol/mol). The estimated population attributable fraction (0.281) (assuming relative risk of diabetes from inactivity=3.3, 40% physically active) would give rise to 392,948 new cases of diabetes which we argue are directly attributed to a prolonged period of lockdown. We estimate that the cost of screening and testing these patients in primary care ({pound}35m), their subsequent treatment and management ({pound}229m), and complications ({pound}909m) would equate to an additional {pound}1.17bn to the health care system.

ConclusionsInactivity related to lockdown in previously active older adults may contribute up to {pound}1.17b in additional healthcare costs through a potential increase in diabetes. Clear advice about the importance of physical activity may reduce this potential economic burden during global pandemics.","Kipps, C.; Hamer, M.; Hill, N.; Lorgelly, P.",2020-06-08,Health Economics,10.1101/2020.06.06.20124065,1,Mark Hamer,UCL,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.06.20124065v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.06.20124065v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
5337,Organising outpatient dialysis services during the COVID-19 pandemic. A simulation and mathematical modelling study.,"BackgroundThis study presents two simulation modelling tools to support the organisation of networks of dialysis services during the COVID-19 pandemic. These tools were developed to support renal services in the South of England (the Wessex region caring for 650 patients), but are applicable elsewhere.

MethodsA discrete-event simulation was used to model a worst case spread of COVID-19 (80% infected over three months), to stress-test plans for dialysis provision throughout the COVID-19 outbreak. We investigated the ability of the system to manage the mix of COVID-19 positive and negative patients, and examined the likely effects on patients, outpatient workloads across all units, and inpatient workload at the centralised COVID-positive inpatient unit. A second Monte-Carlo vehicle routing model estimated the feasibility of patient transport plans and relaxing the current policy of single COVID-19 patient transport to allow up to four infected patients at a time.

ResultsIf current outpatient capacity is maintained there is sufficient capacity in the South of England to keep COVID-19 negative/recovered and positive patients in separate sessions, but rapid reallocation of patients may be needed (as sessions are cleared of negative/recovered patients to enable that session to be dedicated to positive patients). Outpatient COVID-19 cases will spillover to a secondary site while other sites will experience a reduction in workload. The primary site chosen to manage infected patients will experience a significant increase in outpatients and in-patients. At the peak of infection, it is predicted there will be up to 140 COVID-19 positive patients with 40 to 90 of these as inpatients, likely breaching current inpatient capacity (and possibly leading to a need for temporary movement of dialysis equipment).

Patient transport services will also come under considerable pressure. If patient transport operates on a policy of one positive patient at a time, and two-way transport is needed, a likely scenario estimates 80 ambulance drive time hours per day (not including fixed drop-off and ambulance cleaning times). Relaxing policies on individual patient transport to 2-4 patients per trip can save 40-60% of drive time. In mixed urban/rural geographies steps may need to be taken to temporarily accommodate renal COVID-19 positive patients closer to treatment facilities.

ConclusionsDiscrete-event simulation simulation and Monte-Carlo vehicle routing model provides a useful method for stress-testing inpatient and outpatient clinical systems prior to peak COVID-19 workloads.","Allen, M.; Bhanji, A.; Willemsen, J.; Dudfield, S.; Logan, S.; Monks, T.",2020-04-27,Nephrology,10.1101/2020.04.22.20075457,1,Thomas Monks,University of Exeter,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20075457v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20075457v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1371/journal.pone.0237628
4496,Multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model for COVID-19 -- a revisit to Singapore's case,"BackgroundCOVID-19 has been impacting on the whole world critically and constantly since late December 2019. Rapidly increasing infections has raised intense world-wide attention. How to model the evolution of COVID-19 effectively and efficiently is of great significance for prevention and control.

MethodsWe propose the multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model based on the original single-chain model in [8] to describe the evolution of COVID-19 in Singapore. Multi-chains can be considered as the superposition of several single chains with different characteristics. We identify parameters of models by minimizing the penalty function.

ResultsThe numerical simulation results exhibit the multichain model performs well on data fitting. Though unsteady the increments are, they could still fall within the range of {+/-}25% fluctuation from simulation results. It is predicted by multi-chain models that Singapore are experiencing a nonnegligible risk of explosive outbreak, thus stronger measures are urgently needed to contain the epidemic.

ConclusionThe multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model provides an effective way to early detect the appearance of imported infectors and super spreaders and forecast a second outbreak. It can also explain the data in those countries where the single-chain model shows deviation from the data.","Pan, H.; Shao, N.; Yan, Y.; Luo, X.; Wang, S.; Ye, L.; Cheng, J.; Chen, W.",2020-04-17,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.13.20063792,1,Wenbin Chen,Fudan University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063792v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063792v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1007/s40484-020-0224-3
18134,Short-term forecasts to inform the response to the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK,"BackgroundShort-term forecasts of infectious disease can aid situational awareness and planning for outbreak response. Here, we report on multi-model forecasts of Covid-19 in the UK that were generated at regular intervals starting at the end of March 2020, in order to monitor expected healthcare utilisation and population impacts in real time.

MethodsWe evaluated the performance of individual model forecasts generated between 24 March and 14 July 2020, using a variety of metrics including the weighted interval score as well as metrics that assess the calibration, sharpness, bias and absolute error of forecasts separately. We further combined the predictions from individual models into ensemble forecasts using a simple mean as well as a quantile regression average that aimed to maximise performance. We compared model performance to a null model of no change.

ResultsIn most cases, individual models performed better than the null model, and ensembles models were well calibrated and performed comparatively to the best individual models. The quantile regression average did not noticeably outperform the mean ensemble.

ConclusionsEnsembles of multi-model forecasts can inform the policy response to the Covid-19 pandemic by assessing future resource needs and expected population impact of morbidity and mortality.","Funk, S.; Abbott, S.; Atkins, B.

12083,Excess mortality during the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy: a two-stage interrupted time series analysis,"BackgroundItaly was the first country outside China to experience the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a significant health burden. This study presents an analysis of the excess mortality across the 107 Italian provinces, stratified by sex, age group, and period of the outbreak.

MethodsThe analysis was performed using a two-stage interrupted time series design using daily mortality data for the period January 2015 - May 2020. In the first stage, we performed province-level quasi-Poisson regression models, with smooth functions to define a baseline risk while accounting for trends and weather conditions and to flexibly estimate the variation in excess risk during the outbreak. Estimates were pooled in the second stage using a mixed-effects multivariate meta-analysis.

ResultsIn the period 15 February - 15 May 2020, we estimated an excess of 47,490 (95% empirical confidence intervals: 43,984 to 50,362) deaths in Italy, corresponding to an increase of 29.5% (95%eCI: 26.8 to 31.9%) from the expected mortality. The analysis indicates a strong geographical pattern, with the majority of excess deaths occurring in northern regions, where few provinces experienced up to 800% increase during the peak in late March. There were differences by sex, age, and area both in the overall impact and in its temporal distribution.

ConclusionsThis study offers a detailed picture of excess mortality during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. The strong geographical and temporal patterns can be related to implementation of lockdown policies and multiple direct and indirect pathways in mortality risk.

Key MessagesO_LIThis study evaluated mortality trends in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic, reporting an excess of 47,490 (95% empirical confidence intervals: 43,984 to 50,362) deaths in the period 15 February - 15 May 2020, corresponding to an increase of 29.5% (95%eCI: 26.8 to 31.9%) from the expected mortality.
C_LIO_LIThere is a strong geographical pattern, with 71.0% of the estimated excess deaths occurring in just three northern regions (Lombardy, Veneto, and Emilia-Romagna), and few provinces showing increases in mortality up to 800% during the peak of the pandemic.
C_LIO_LIThe impact was slightly higher is men compared to women, with 24,655 and 23,125 excess deaths respectively, and varied by age, with higher mortality in the group 70-79 years old and evidence of a lower but measurable risk even in people less than 60.
C_LIO_LIThe analysis by week suggests differential trends, with more delayed impacts in women and elderly, and the risk limited to the early period in Central and Southern Italy, likely related to the implementation of lockdown policies and contributions from direct and indirect risk pathways.

15299,"Relations between demographic, geographic, and environmental statistics, and the spread of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Italy","BACKGROUND: Since January 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has raged around the world, causing nearly a million deaths and hundreds of severe economic crises. In this scenario, Italy has been one of the most affected countries. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated significant correlations between COVID-19 cases and demographic, geographical, and environmental statistics of each Italian region from February 26 to August 12, 2020. We further investigated the link between the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and 10 concentrations before the lockdown in Lombardy. METHODS: All demographic data were obtained from the AdminStat Italia website, and geographic data were from the Il Meteo website. The collection frequency was one week. Data on PM2.5 and PM10 average daily concentrations were collected from previously published articles. We used Pearson's coefficients to correlate the quantities that followed a normal distribution, and Spearman's coefficient to correlate quantities that did not follow a normal distribution. RESULTS: We found significant strong correlations between COVID-19 cases and population number in 60.0% of the regions. We also found a significant strong correlation between the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the various regions and their latitude, and with the historical averages (last 30 years) of their minimum temperatures. We identified a significant strong correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases until August 12 and the average daily concentrations of PM2.5 in Lombardy until February 29, 2020. No significant correlation with PM10 was found in the same periods. However, we found that 40 g/m^3 for PM2.5 and 50 g/m^3 PM10 are plausible thresholds beyond which particulate pollution clearly favors the spread of SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: Since SARS-CoV-2 is correlated with historical minimum temperatures and PM10 and 2.5, health authorities are urged to monitor pollution levels and to invest in precautions for the arrival of autumn. Furthermore, we suggest creating awareness campaigns for the recirculation of air in enclosed places and to avoid exposure to the cold.

Here we comprehensively characterise patients hospitalised with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and healthy community controls. PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants were more likely to receive dexamethasone and a beta-lactam antibiotic, and survive to hospital discharge than PCR-/IgG+ and PCR-/IgG-participants. PCR-/IgG+ participants exhibited a nasal and systemic cytokine signature analogous to PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants, but increased propensity for Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae colonisation. We did not find evidence that HIV co-infection in COVID-19 participants was associated with mortality or altered cytokine responses. The nasal immune signature in PCR-/IgG+ and PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants was distinct and predominated by chemokines and neutrophils. In addition, PCR-/IgG+ individuals with high COVID-19 clinical suspicion had inflammatory profiles analogous to PCR-confirmed disease and potentially represent a target population for COVID-19 treatment strategies.","Morton, B.; Barnes, K.; Anscombe, C.; Jere, K.; Kamng'ona, R.; Brown, C.; Nyirenda, J.; Phiri, T.; Banda, N.

18073,A functional genomics approach to understand host genetic regulation ofCOVID-19 severity,"Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of COVID-19 patients of European ancestry have identified genetic loci significantly associated with disease severity (1). Here, we employed the detailed clinical, immunological and multi-omics dataset of the Human Functional Genomics Projects (HFGP) to explore the physiological significance of the host genetic variants that influence susceptibility to severe COVID-19. A genomics investigation intersected with functional characterization of individuals with high genetic risk for severe COVID-19 susceptibility identified several major patterns: i. a large impact of genetically determined innate immune responses in COVID-19, with increased susceptibility for severe disease in individuals with defective monocyte-derived cytokine production; ii. genetic susceptibility related to ABO blood groups is probably mediated through the von Willebrand factor (VWF) and endothelial dysfunction. We further validated these identified associations at transcript and protein levels by using independent disease cohorts. These insights allow a physiological understanding of genetic susceptibility to severe COVID-19, and indicate pathways that could be targeted for prevention and therapy.

20369,"Clinical diagnosis of COVID-19: a prompt, feasible, and sensitive diagnostic tool for COVID-19 based on a 1,757-patient cohort (The AndroCoV Clinical Scoring for COVID-19 diagnosis).","ImportanceIn the COVID-19 pandemic, a limiting barrier for more successful approaches to COVID-19 is the lack of appropriate timing for its diagnosis, during the viral replication stage, when antiviral approaches could demonstrate efficacy, precluding progression to severe stages. Three major reasons that hamper the diagnosis earlier in the disease are the unspecific and mild symptoms in the first stage, the cost- and time-limitations of the rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2, and the insufficient sensitivity of this test as desired for screening purposes during the pandemic. More sensitive and earlier methods of COVID-19 detection should be considered as key for breakthrough changes in the disease course and response to specific therapeutic strategies. Our objective was to propose a clinical scoring for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (The AndroCoV Clinical Scoring for COVID-19 Diagnosis) that has been validated in a large population sample, aiming to encourage the management of patients with high pre-clinical likelihood of presenting COVID-19, at least during the pandemics, independent of a rtPCR-SARS-COV-2 test.

Materials and methodsThis is a compounded retrospective and prospective analysis of clinical data prospectively collected from the Pre-AndroCoV and AndroCov Trials that resulted in a clinical scoring for COVID-19 diagnosis based on likelihood of presenting COVID-19 according to the number of symptoms, presence of anosmia, and known positive household contact, in a variety of combinations of scoring criteria, aiming to the detect scorings that provided the highest pre-test probability and accuracy. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and accuracy were calculated for subjects screened in two different periods and altogether, for females, males, and both, in a total of nine different scenarios, for combinations between one, two, or three or more symptoms, or presence of anosmia in subjects without known positive household contacts, and no symptoms, one, two, or three or more symptoms, or presence of anosmia or ageusia in subjects with known positive household contacts.

Results1,757 patients were screened for COVID-19. Among the multiple combinations, requiring two or more symptoms with or without anosmia or ageusia for subjects without known contact and one or more symptoms with or without anosmia or ageusia with known positive contacts presented the highest accuracy (80.4%), and higher pretest probability and accuracy than virtually all rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 commercially available kit tests.

ConclusionThe AndroCoV Clinical Scoring for COVID-19 Diagnosis was demonstrated to be a feasible, quick, inexpensive and sensitive diagnostic tool for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. A clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 should avoid delays and missed diagnosis, and reduce costs, and should therefore be recommended as a first-line option for COVID-19 diagnosis for public health policies, at least while SARS-CoV-2 is the prevailing circulating virus.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 sensitive, accurate, and feasible?

FindingsThe present analysis of a 1,757-subject cohort of the AndroCoV trials demonstrated that clinical scoring for COVID-19 diagnosis can deliver a more sensitive and prompter diagnosis than the current gold-standard diagnostic method, rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2, with an accuracy above 80%.

MeaningA clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 avoids missed diagnosis due to insufficient sensitivity or incorrect timing of the performance of rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2, reduces costs, avoid delays on specific managements, and allows the testing of potentially effective antiviral therapeutic approaches that should work if administered in the early stage of COVID-19","Cadegiani, F.

14765,Mitigation Strategies and Compliance in the Covid-19 Fight; How Much Compliance is Enough?,"Today, with only 4% of the worlds population, the U.S. is bearing a disproportionate share of COVID-19 infections. Seeking to understand this puzzle, we investigate how mitigation strategies and compliance can work together (or in opposition) to reduce (or increase) the spread of COVID-19 infection. Drilling down to the state level, we create specific state indices suitable for the U.S. to measure the degree of strictness of public mitigation measures. In this, we build on the Oxford Stringency Index. A modified time-varying SEIRD model, incorporating this Stringency Index as well as a Compliance Indicator to reduce the transmission, is then estimated with daily data for a sample of 6 U.S. states. These are New York, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, and Arizona. We provide a simple visual policy tool to evaluate the various combinations of mitigation policies and compliance that can reduce the basic reproduction number to less than one; this is the acknowledged threshold in the epidemiological literature to control the pandemic. States successful in combating the pandemic were able to achieve a suitable combination. Understanding of this relationship by the public and policy makers is key to controlling the pandemic.

This study demonstrates the feasibility and efficiency of vaccine implementation in a carceral setting.","Berk, J.; Murphy, M.; Chan, P.; Kane, K.; Rich, J.; Brinkley-Rubinstein, L.",2021-04-29,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.04.27.21252790,1,Justin Berk,Alpert Medical School at Brown University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.27.21252790v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.27.21252790v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
11804,The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on People with Parkinson's Disease,"ObjectiveTo rapidly identify areas of need and improve care in people with Parkinsons disease (PwPD) affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, we deployed a survey focusing on the presentation and complications of COVID-19 infection and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic among those not infected.

MethodsIndividuals with and without PD participating in the online study Fox Insight (FI) were invited to complete an online survey between April 23-May 23, 2020. Among people reporting COVID-19 diagnosis, we compared the frequency of symptoms and poor outcomes in people with and without PD. Among people not reporting COVID-19, we assessed the effects of the pandemic on access to medical care and other services, and in PwPD, its effects on PD symptoms.

ResultsAmong 5,429 PwPD and 1,452 without PD, 77 reported a COVID-19 diagnosis (51 PwPD, 26 without PD). Complications were more frequent in people with longer PD duration. PwPD and COVID-19 experienced new or worsening motor (63%) and nonmotor (75%) PD symptoms. PwPD not diagnosed with COVID-19 reported disrupted medical care (64%), exercise (21%), and social activities (57%), and worsened PD motor (43%) and non-motor (52%) symptoms. Disruptions were more common for PwPD living alone, and for those with lower income and non-white race.

ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic is associated with wide-ranging effects on people with PD, and certain groups may be at particular risk. FI provides a rapid, patient-centered means to assess these effects and identify needs that can be used to improve the health of PwPD.","Brown, E. G.; Chahine, L. M.; Goldman, S.

20524,Stochastic model for COVID-19 in slums: interaction between biology and public policies,"We present a mathematical model for the simulation of the development of an outbreak of COVID-19 in a slum area under different interventions. Instead of representing interventions as modulations of the parameters of a free running epidemic we introduce a model structure that accounts for the actions but does not assume the results. The disease is modelled in terms of the progression of viremia reported in scientific works. The emergence of symptoms in the model reflects the statistics of a nation-wide highly detailed database consisting of more than 62000 cases (about a half of the confirmed by RT-PCR tests) with recorded symptoms in Argentina. The stochastic model displays several of the characteristics of COVID-19 such as a high variability in the evolution of the outbreaks, including long periods in which they run undetected, spontaneous extinction followed by a late outbreak and unimodal as well as bimodal progressions of daily counts of cases (second waves without ad-hoc hypothesis). We show how the relation between undetected cases (including the """"asymptomatic"""" cases) and detected cases changes as a function of the public policies, the efficiency of the implementation and the timing with respect to the development of the outbreak. We show also that the relation between detected cases and total cases strongly depends on the implemented policies and that detected cases cannot be regarded as a measure of the outbreak, being the dependency between total cases and detected cases in general not monotonic as a function of the efficiency in the intervention method. According to the model, it is possible to control an outbreak with interventions based on the detection of symptoms only in the case when the presence of just one symptom prompts isolation and the detection efficiency reaches about 80% of the cases. Requesting two symptoms to trigger intervention can be enough to fail in the goals.","Solari, H. G.; Natiello, M. A.",2021-04-12,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.01.06.21249318,2,Mario A.

3063,Multiple-Input Deep Convolutional Neural Network Model for COVID-19 Forecasting in China,"COVID-19 is spreading all across the globe. Up until March 23, 2020, the confirmed cases in 173 countries and regions of the globe had surpassed 346,000, and more than 14,700 deaths had resulted. The confirmed cases outside of China had also reached over 81,000, with over 3,200 deaths. In this study, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was proposed to analyze and predict the number of confirmed cases. Several cities with the most confirmed cases in China were the focus of this study, and a COVID-19 forecasting model, based on the CNN deep neural network method, was proposed. To compare the overall efficacies of different algorithms, the indicators of mean absolute error and root mean square error were applied in the experiment of this study. The experiment results indicated that compared with other deep learning methods, the CNN model proposed in this study has the greatest prediction efficacy. The feasibility and practicality of the model in predicting the cumulative number of COVID-19 confirmed cases were also verified in this study.","Huang, C.-J.; Chen, Y.-H.; Ma, Y.; Kuo, P.-H.",2020-03-27,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.23.20041608,1,Ping-Huan Kuo,National Pingtung University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041608v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041608v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
21807,Inference on the dynamics of the COVID pandemic from observational data,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWWe describe a time dependent stochastic dynamic model in discrete time for the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in various states of USA. The proposed multi-compartment model is expressed through a system of difference equations that describe their temporal dynamics. Various compartments in our model is connected to the social distancing measures and diagnostic testing rates. A nonparametric estimation strategy is employed for obtaining estimates of interpretable temporally static and dynamic epidemiological rate parameters. The confidence bands of the parameters are obtained using a residual bootstrap procedure. A key feature of the methodology is its ability to estimate latent compartments such as the trajectory of the number of asymptomatic but infected individuals which are the key vectors of COVID-19 spread. The nature of the disease dynamics is further quantified by the proposed epidemiological markers, which use estimates of such key latent compartments.","Bhattacharjee, S.; Liao, S.; Paul, D.; Chaudhuri, S.",2021-02-03,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.02.01.21250936,1,Sanjay Chaudhuri,"Deapartment of Statistics and Applied Probability, National University of Singapore",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250936v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250936v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

In Myanmar, first COVID-19 reported cases were identified on 23rd March 2020. There were 336 reported confirmed cases, 261 recovered and 6 deaths through 13th July 2020. The study was a retrospective case series and all COVID-19 confirmed cases from 23rd March to 13th July 2020 were included. The data series of COVID-19 cases were extracted from the daily official reports of the Ministry of Health and Sports (MOHS), Myanmar and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Myanmar. Among 336 confirmed cases, there were 169 cases with reported transmission events. The median serial interval was 4 days (IQR 3, 2-5) with the range of 0 - 26 days. The mean of the reproduction number was 1.44 with (95% CI = 1.30-1.60) by exponential growth method and 1.32 with (95% CI = 0.98-1.73) confident interval by maximum likelihood method. This study outlined the epidemiological characteristics and epidemic parameters of COVID-19 in Myanmar. The estimation parameters in this study can be comparable with other studies and variability of these parameters can be considered when implementing disease control strategy in Myanmar.","Thway, A.

17693,Preferential observation of large infectious disease outbreaks leads to consistent overestimation of intervention efficacy.,"Data from infectious disease outbreaks in congregate settings are often used to elicit clues about which types of interventions may be useful in other facilities. This is commonly done using before-and-after comparisons in which the infectiousness of pre-intervention cases is compared to that of post-intervention cases and the difference is attributed to intervention impact. In this manuscript, we show how a tendency to preferentially observe large outbreaks can lead to consistent overconfidence in how effective these interventions actually are. We show, in particular, that these inferences are highly susceptible to bias when the pathogen under consideration exhibits moderate-to-high amounts of heterogeneity in infectiousness. This includes important pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, influenza, Noroviruses, HIV, Tuberculosis, and many others","Zelner, J.; Masters, N.

18231,Epigenetic clocks are not accelerated in COVID-19 patients,"Age is a major risk factor for severe outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but it remains unclear if this is rather due to increased chronological age or biological age. During lifetime, specific DNA methylation changes are acquired in our genome that act as """"epigenetic clocks"""" allowing to estimate donor age and to provide a surrogate marker for biological age. In this study, we followed the hypothesis that particularly patients with accelerated epigenetic age are affected by severe outcomes of COVID-19. Using four different age predictors, we did not observe accelerated age in global DNA methylation profiles of blood samples of nine COVID-19 patients. Alternatively, we used targeted bisulfite amplicon sequencing of three age-associated genomic regions to estimate donor-age of blood samples of 95 controls and seventeen COVID-19 patients. The predictions correlated well with chronological age, while COVID-19 patients even tended to be predicted younger than expected. Furthermore, lymphocytes in nineteen COVID-19 patients did not reveal significantly accelerated telomere attrition. Our results demonstrate that these biomarkers of biological age are therefore not suitable to predict a higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection in elderly patients.","Franzen, J.; Nuechtern, S.; Tharmapalan, V.; Vieri, M.; Nikolic, M.; Han, Y.; Balfanz, P.; Marx, N.; Dreher, M.; Bruemmendorf, T.

The SIS model has two compartments, susceptible and infected. In this model, the interest is to determine the number of infected people at a given time point. However, it is also essential to know the cumulative number of infected people at a given time point, which is not directly available from the SIS models present structure. In this work, we propose a modified structure of the SIS model to determine the cumulative number of infected people at a given time point.

7034,Risk assessment and prediction of severe or critical illness of COVID-19 in the elderly,"(1) BackgroundThis study aims to investigate the clinical characteristics and risk prediction of severe or critical events of COVID-19 in the elderly patients in China.

(2) MethodsThe clinical data of COVID-19 in the elderly patients admitted to the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center during the period of January 20, 2020 to March 16, 2020 were collected. A retrospective cohort study design was conducted to screen out independent factors through Cox univariable regression analysis and multivariable regression analysis, and the efficacy of risk prediction of severe or critical illness was examined through the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

(3) ResultsA total of 110 elderly patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. 52 (47.3%) were males and 21 (19.1%) had severe or critical illness.

For COVID-19 patients, cancer is a coexisting disease that should not be Here, we conducted a multicenter retrospective study to show the clinical information and outcomes of cancer patients infected with COVID-19.

MeasurementsMedical records of COVID-19 patients with cancer admitted to hospitals from Jan 5, 2020 to Feb 18, 2020 were collected.

ResultsOf the 67 patients (median age: 66 years), the median age of patients with severe illness was older than that of patients with mild symptoms (P<0.001). The proportion of severe patients had co-morbidities was higher than patients with mild disease (P=0.004). During the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia, tumor progression and recurrence was not observed for those patients still at the anticancer treatment phase. Lymphocytopenia was the main laboratory finding accompanying increased C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in cancer patients, especially in severe cases. By Mar 10, 2020, 18 (26.9%) patients died from COVID-19. The median age of survivors was younger than that of deaths (P=0.014). Lung cancer (n=15, 22.4%) was the most common cancer type and accounted for the highest proportion COVID-19 resulted deaths (33.3%, 5/15). We observed a tendency that patients at the follow-up phase had a better prognosis than that at anticancer treatment phase (P=0.095).

ConclusionThis study showed COVID-19 patients with cancer seem to have a higher proportion of severe cases and poorer prognosis.

13988,COVID-19 is associated with relative ADAMTS13 deficiency and VWF multimer formation resembling TTP,"BackgroundThrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) has been repeatedly described in COVID-19 and may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 associated hypercoagulability. The underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We hypothesized that endothelial damage may lead to substantially increased concentrations of Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) with subsequent relative deficiency of ADAMTS13.

MethodsA prospective controlled trial was performed on 75 patients with COVID-19 of mild to critical severity and 10 healthy controls. VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), ADAMTS13 and VWF multimer formation were analyzed in a German hemostaseologic laboratory.

ResultsVWF:Ag was 4.8 times higher in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (p< 0.0001), whereas ADAMTS13 activities were not significantly different (p = 0.24). The ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio was significantly lower in COVID-19 than in the control group (24.4{+/-}20.5 vs. 79.7{+/-}33.2, p< 0.0001). Fourteen patients (18.7%) undercut a critical ratio of 10 as described in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Gel analysis of multimers resembled the TTP constellation with loss of the largest multimers in 75% and a smeary triplet pattern in 39% of the patients. The ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio decreased continuously from mild to critical disease (ANOVA p = 0.026). Moreover, it differed significantly between surviving patients and those who died from COVID-19 (p = 0.001) yielding an AUC of 0.232 in ROC curve analysis.

ConclusionCOVID-19 is associated with a substantial increase in VWF levels, which can exceed the ADAMTS13 processing capacity resulting in the formation of large VWF multimers identical to TTP. The ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio is an independent predictor of severity of disease and mortality. These findings render further support to perform studies on the use of plasma exchange in COVID-19 and to include VWF and ADAMTS13 in the diagnostic workup.","Doevelaar, A. A.

17870,Synchronization in Epidemic Growth and the Impossibility of Selective Containment,"Containment, aiming to prevent the epidemic stage of community-spreading altogether, and mitigation, aiming to merely  flatten the curve of a wide-ranged outbreak, constitute two qualitatively different approaches to combating an epidemic through non-pharmaceutical interventions. Here, we study a simple model of epidemic dynamics separating the population into two groups, namely a low-risk group and a high-risk group, for which different strategies are pursued. Due to synchronization effects, we find that maintaining a slower epidemic growth behavior for the high-risk group is unstable against any finite coupling between the two groups. More precisely, the density of infected individuals in the two groups qualitatively evolves very similarly, apart from a small time delay and an overall scaling factor quantifying the coupling between the groups. Hence, selective containment of the epidemic in a targeted (high-risk) group is practically impossible whenever the surrounding society implements a mitigated community-spreading. We relate our general findings to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Budich, J. C.; Bergholtz, E. J.",2020-11-07,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.11.06.20226894,1,Emil J.

19097,Protocol for a Feasibility study incorporating a Randomised Pilot Trial with an Embedded Process Evaluation and Feasibility Economic Analysis of ThinkCancer!: A primary care intervention to expedite cancer diagnosis in Wales,"BackgroundRelative to the rest of Europe, the UK has relatively poor cancer outcomes, with late diagnosis and a slow referral process being major contributors. General practitioners (GPs) are often faced with patients presenting with a multitude of non-specific symptoms that could be cancer. Safety netting can be used to manage diagnostic uncertainty by ensuring patients with vague symptoms are appropriately monitored, which is now even more crucial due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and its major impact on cancer referrals. The ThinkCancer! Workshop is an educational behaviour change intervention aimed at the whole general practice team, designed to improve primary care approaches to ensure timely diagnosis of cancer. The workshop will consist of teaching and awareness sessions, the appointment of a Safety Netting Champion and the development of a bespoke Safety Netting Plan, and has been adapted so it can be delivered remotely. This study aims to assess the feasibility of the ThinkCancer! Intervention for a future definitive randomised controlled trial.

MethodsThe ThinkCancer! study is a randomised, multisite feasibility trial, with an embedded process evaluation and feasibility economic analysis. Twenty-three to 30 general practices will be recruited across Wales, randomised in a ratio of 2:1 of intervention versus control who will follow usual care. The workshop will be delivered by a GP educator and will be adapted iteratively throughout the trial period. Baseline practice characteristics will be collected via questionnaire. We will also collect Primary Care Intervals (PCI), Two Week Wait (2WW) referral rates, conversion rates and detection rates at baseline and six months post-randomisation. Participant feedback, researcher reflections and economic costings will be collected following each workshop. A process evaluation will assess implementation using an adapted Normalisation Measure Development (NoMAD) questionnaire and qualitative interviews. An economic feasibility analysis will inform a future economic evaluation.

DiscussionThis study will allow us to test and further develop a novel evidenced-based complex intervention aimed at general practice teams to expedite the diagnosis of cancer in primary care. The results from this study will inform the future design of a full-scale definitive phase III trial.

22363,Quantification of the tradeoff between test sensitivity and test frequency in COVID-19 epidemic - a multi-scale modeling approach,"Control strategies that employ real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for the diagnosis and surveillance of COVID-19 epidemic are inefficient in fighting the epidemic due to high cost, delays in obtaining results, and the need of specialized personnel and equipment for laboratory processing. Cheaper and faster alternatives, such as antigen and paper-strip tests, have been proposed. They return results rapidly, but have lower sensitivity thresholds for detecting virus. To quantify the effects of the tradeoffs between sensitivity, cost, testing frequency, and delay in test return on the overall course of an outbreak, we built a multi-scale immuno-epidemiological model that connects the virus profile of infected individuals with transmission and testing at the population level. We investigated various randomized testing strategies and found that, for fixed testing capacity, lower sensitivity tests with shorter return delays slightly flatten the daily incidence curve and delay the time to the peak daily incidence. However, compared with RT-PCR testing, they do not always reduce the cumulative case count at half a year into the outbreak. When testing frequency is increased to account for the lower cost of less sensitive tests, we observe a large reduction in cumulative case counts, from 57% to as low as 1.5% half a year into the outbreak and to 3.2% three years into the outbreak. The improvement is preserved even when the testing budget is reduced by one half or one third. Our results predict that surveillance testing that employs low-sensitivity tests at high frequency is an effective tool for epidemic control.","Forde, J. E.; Ciupe, S.

22591,Follow-up study in the ski-resort Ischgl: Antibody and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 persisted for up to 8 months after infection and transmission of virus was low even during the second infection wave in Austria,"BackgroundIn early March 2020, a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the ski resort Ischgl in Austria initiated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout Austria and Northern Europe. In a cross-sectional study, we found that the seroprevalence in the adult population of Ischgl had reached 45% by the end of April. To answer the question of how long immunity persists and what effect this high-level immunity had on virus transmission, we performed a follow-up study in early November, 2020.

MethodsOf the 1259 adults that participated in the baseline study, 801 could be included in the follow-up. The study involved the analysis of binding and neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses. In addition, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Ischgl was compared to the incidence in similar municipalities in Tyrol throughout 2020.

FindingsFor the 801 individuals that participated in both studies, the seroprevalence declined from 51.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 47.9 - 54.9) to 45.4% (95% CI 42.0 - 49.0). Median antibody concentrations dropped considerably but antibody avidity increased. T cell responses were analysed in 93 cases, including all 4 formerly seropositive cases that had lost antibodies in all assays, three of which still had detectable T cell memory. In addition, the incidence in the second COVID-19 wave that hit Austria in November 2020, was significantly lower in Ischgl than in comparable municipalities in Tyrol or the rest of Austria.

InterpretationThis study has important implications as it shows that although antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 declined, T and B cell memory can be detected for up to 8 months. Complemented by infection prevention measures a level of around 40-45% immunity in Ischgl significantly reduced local virus transmission during the second wave in Austria in November 2020.

4777,Outcomes of hydroxychloroquine usage in United States veterans hospitalized with Covid-19,"BACKGROUNDDespite limited and conflicting data on the use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with Covid-19, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the emergency use of this drug when clinical trials are unavailable or infeasible. Hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with azithromycin, is being widely used in Covid-19 therapy based on anecdotal and limited observational evidence.

METHODSWe performed a retrospective analysis of data from patients hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in all United States Veterans Health Administration medical centers until April 11, 2020. Patients were categorized based on their exposure to hydroxychloroquine alone (HC) or with azithromycin (HC+AZ) as treatments in addition to standard supportive management for Covid-19. The two primary outcomes were death and the need for mechanical ventilation. We determined the association between treatment and the primary outcomes using competing risk hazard regression adjusting for clinical characteristics via propensity scores. Discharge and death were taken into account as competing risks and subdistribution hazard ratios are presented.

RESULTSA total of 368 patients were evaluated (HC, n=97; HC+AZ, n=113; no HC, n=158). Rates of death in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups were 27.8%, 22.1%, 11.4%, respectively. Rates of ventilation in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups were 13.3%, 6.9%, 14.1%, respectively. Compared to the no HC group, the risk of death from any cause was higher in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.10 to 6.17; P=0.03) but not in the HC+AZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.56 to 2.32; P=0.72). The risk of ventilation was similar in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.53 to 3.79; P=0.48) and in the HC+AZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.16 to 1.12; P=0.09), compared to the no HC group.

CONCLUSIONSIn this study, we found no evidence that use of hydroxychloroquine, either with or without azithromycin, reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with Covid-19. An association of increased overall mortality was identified in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone. These findings highlight the importance of awaiting the results of ongoing prospective, randomized, controlled studies before widespread adoption of these drugs.","Magagnoli, J.; Narendran, S.; Pereira, F.; Cummings, T.; Hardin, J.

8066,Drug treatments affecting ACE2 in COVID-19 infection: a systematic review protocol,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 virus causing COVID-19 binds human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in human tissues. ACE2 expression may be associated with COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. Routinely prescribed drugs which up- or down-regulate ACE2 expression are therefore of critical research interest as agents which might promote or reduce risk of COVID-19 infection in a susceptible population.

AimTo review evidence on routinely prescribed drug treatments in the UK that could up- or down-regulate ACE2 and potentially affect COVID-19 infection.

Design and settingSystematic review of studies published in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science from inception to April 1st 2020.

MethodA systematic review will be conducted in line with PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion criteria will be: i) assess effect of drug exposure on ACE2 level; ii) drug is included in British National Formulary (BNF) and therefore available to prescribe in UK; iii) a control, placebo or sham group is included as comparator. Exclusion criteria will be: i) ACE2 measurement in utero; ii) ACE2 measurement in children under 18 years; iii) drug not in BNF; iv) review article. Quality will be assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for human studies, and the SYRCLE risk of bias tool for animal studies.

ResultsData will be reported in summary tables and narrative synthesis.

ConclusionThis systematic review will identify drug therapies which may increase or decrease ACE2 expression. This might identify medications increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission, or as targets for intervention in mitigating transmission.","Dambha-Miller, H.; Albasri, A.; Hodgson, S.; Wilcox, C.; Islam, N.; Khan, S.; Little, P.; Griffin, S.

18456,Early chains of transmission of COVID-19 in France,"IntroductionSARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, has spread rapidly across the world. A dedicated surveillance system was implemented in France in January 2020 to improve early detection of cases and their contacts and limit secondary transmission. Our objective was to use contact-tracing data collected during this initial phase of the epidemic to better characterize SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

MethodsWe analysed data collected during contact tracing and retrospective epidemiological investigations in France from 24 January to 30 March 2020. We assessed the secondary clinical attack rate and characterized the risk of a contact becoming a case. We described chains of transmission and estimated key parameters of spread.

ResultsOver the study period, 6,082 contacts of 735 confirmed cases were traced. The overall secondary clinical attack rate was 4.1% (95%CI 3.6-4.6) and increased with age of the index case and of the contact. Family contacts were at higher risk of becoming cases (adjusted odds ratio 2.1 (95%CI 1.4-3.0)) while nosocomial contacts were at lower risk (adjusted odds ratio 0.3 (95%CI 0.1-0.7)), compared to coworkers/friends. We identified 328 infector/infectee pairs, 49% of which were family members. The distribution of secondary cases was highly over-dispersed with 80% of secondary cases being caused by 10% of cases. The mean serial interval was 5.1 days (interquartile range 2-8 days) in contact-tracing pairs where late transmission events may be censored, and 6.8 (3-8) days in pairs investigated retrospectively.

ConclusionThis study contributes to improving our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, such as the importance of superspreading events. Contact-tracing data are challenging to collect but are key to better understand emerging pathogens.

7071,COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study with focus on the over-80s and hospital-onset disease,"ObjectivesTo describe the presenting features and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in a UK hospital, with a focus on those patients over 80 years and patients with hospital onset infection.

DesignRetrospective cohort study with data extracted from the electronic records of patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to our institution.

SettingSuburban general hospital serving Londons most populous borough.

ParticipantsThe first 450 inpatients admitted to our hospital with swab-confirmed COVID-19 infection.

Primary outcomeThe primary outcome measure was death during the index hospital admission.

ResultsThe median (IQR) age was 72 (56, 83), with 150 (33%) over 80 years old and 60% male. Presenting clinical and biochemical features were consistent with those reported elsewhere. The ethnic breakdown of patients admitted was similar to that of our underlying local population with no excess of BAME deaths. Inpatient mortality was high at 38%.

Patients over 80 presented earlier in their disease course and were significantly less likely to present with the typical features of cough, breathlessness and fever. Cardiac co-morbidity and markers of cardiac dysfunction were more common, but not those of bacterial infection. Mortality was significantly higher in this group (60% vs 28%, p < 0.001).

31 (7%) of patients were classified as having hospital-onset COVID-19 infection. The peak of hospital-onset infections occurred at the same time as the overall peak of admitted infections. Despite being older and more frail, the outcomes for this cohort were no worse.

ConclusionsInpatient mortality was high, especially among the over-80s, who were more likely to present atypically. The ethnic composition of our caseload was similar to the underlying population. While a significant number of patients presented with COVID-19 while already in hospital, their outcomes were no worse.

22997,SARS-CoV-2 infection in households with and without young children: Nationwide cohort study,"BackgroundInfections with seasonally spreading human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are common among young children during winter months in the northern hemisphere, with immunological response lasting around a year. However, it is not clear whether recent household exposure to HCoVs reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsIn a nationwide cohort study we followed all adults in Denmark aged 18 to 60 years from February 27 to November 15, 2020. Hazard ratios of SARS-CoV-2 infection by number of young children aged ten months to five years living in the household were estimated using Cox regression adjusted for adult age, gender, and other potential confounders. In sensitivity analyses we investigated the effect of age of children in the household, number of children living outside of the household, and number of other adult household-members.

ResultsAmong 449,915 adults in Denmark living in households with young children, 5,761 were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, while among 2,629,821 adults without young children in their household, 33,788 were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.09). Sensitivity analyses of age of children in the household, number of children living outside of the household, and number of additional adult household members found increasing number of children, and especially increasing number of older children, to substantially increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ConclusionsLiving in a household with young children was not associated with decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby suggesting no strong preventive effect of recent exposure to HCoVs against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Husby, A.; Corn, G.; Krause, T.

5683,Impact of virus testing on COVID-19 case fatality rate: estimate using a fixed-effects model,"BackgroundIn response to the SARS-CoV2 pandemic, governments have adopted a variety of public health measures. There are variations in how much testing has been done across countries. South Korea, Germany, and Iceland take the bet of massive testing of their population. Whereas tests were not performed widely in southern European countries. As the former undergo a lower case-fatality rate due to the COVID-19 than the latter, the impact of the testing strategy must be investigated. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of testing on the case fatality rate.

MethodsWe use data on inpatients across French geographic areas and propose a novel methodology that exploits policy discontinuities at region borders to estimate the effect of COVID-19 tests on the case-fatality rate. In France, testing policies are determined locally. We compare all contiguous department pairs located on the opposite sides of a region border. The heterogeneity in testing rate between department pairs together with the similarities in other dimensions allow us to mimic the existence of treatment and control groups and to identify the impact of testing on mortality.

ResultsThe increase of one percentage point in the test rate is associated with a decrease of 0.001 percentage point in the death rate. In other words, for each additional 1000 tests, one person would have remained alive.

ConclusionMassive population testing could have a significant effect on mortality in different ways. Mass testing may help decision-makers to implement healthcare measures to limit the spread of the disease.","Terriau, A.; Albertini, J.; Poirier, A.; Le Bastard, Q.",2020-05-01,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.26.20080531,1,Quentin Le Bastard,Nantes University Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.20080531v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.20080531v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
14024,The Effect of Area Deprivation on COVID-19 Risk in Louisiana,"PurposeLouisiana currently has the highest per capita case count for COVID-19 in the United States and disproportionately affects the Black or African American population. Neighborhood deprivation has been observed to be associated with poorer health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between neighborhood deprivation and COVID-19 in Louisiana.

MethodsThe Area Deprivation Index (ADI) was calculated and used to classify neighborhood deprivation at the census tract level. A total of 17 US census variables were used to calculate the ADI for each of the 1148 census tracts in Louisiana. The data were extracted from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2018. The neighborhoods were categorized into quintiles as well as low and high deprivation. The publicly available COVID-19 cumulative case counts by census tract was obtained from the Louisiana Department of Health website on July 31, 2020. Descriptive and Poisson regression analyses were performed.

ResultsNeighborhoods in Louisiana were substantially different with respect to deprivation. The ADI ranged from 136.00 for the most deprived neighborhood and -33.87 in the least deprived neighborhood. We observed that individuals residing in the most deprived neighborhoods had a 45% higher risk of COVID-19 disease compared to those residing in the least deprived neighborhoods.

ConclusionWhile the majority of previous studies were focused on very limited socio-environmental factors such as crowding and income, this study used a composite area-based deprivation index to examine the role of neighborhood environment on COVID-19. We observed a positive relationship between neighborhood deprivation and COVID-19 risk in Louisiana. The study findings can be utilized to promote public health preventions measures besides social distancing, wearing a mask while in public and frequent handwashing in vulnerable neighborhoods with greater deprivation.","Kc, M.; Oral, E.; Straif-Bourgeois, S.; Rung, A.

19103,International estimates of intended uptake and refusal of COVID-19 vaccines: A rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of large nationally representative samples,"BackgroundWidespread uptake of COVID-19 vaccines will be essential to extinguishing the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccines have been developed in unprecedented time and hesitancy towards vaccination among the general population is unclear.

MethodsSystematic review and meta-analysis of studies using large nationally representative samples (n[&ge;]1000) to examine the percentage of the population intending to vaccinate, unsure, or intending to refuse a COVID-19 vaccine when available. Generic inverse meta-analysis and meta-regression were used to pool estimates and examine time trends. PubMed, Scopus and pre-printer servers were searched from January-November, 2020. Registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020223132).

FindingsTwenty-eight nationally representative samples (n = 58,656) from 13 countries indicate that as the pandemic has progressed, the percentage of people intending to vaccinate and refuse vaccination have been decreasing and increasing respectively. Pooled data from surveys conducted during June-October suggest that 60% (95% CI: 49% to 69%) intend to vaccinate and 20% (95% CI: 13% to 29%) intend to refuse vaccination, although intentions vary substantially between samples and countries (I2 > 90%). Being female, younger, of lower income or education level and belonging to an ethnic minority group were consistently associated with being less likely to intend to vaccinate. Findings were consistent across higher vs. lower quality studies.

InterpretationIntentions to be vaccinated when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available have been declining globally and there is an urgent need to address social inequalities in vaccine hesitancy and promote widespread uptake of vaccines as they become available.

FundingN/A

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed, Scopus and pre-print servers for manuscripts from January to November, 2020, reporting on studies examining intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in large nationally representative samples (N[&ge;]1000). No language restrictions were applied. Search terms were [(COVID OR coronavirus OR SARS-COV-2) AND (Vaccine OR Vaccination) AND (Inten* OR willing* OR attitud* OR hypothetical)]. From 792 articles, we identified 20 eligible articles reporting on 28 nationally representative samples.

Added value of this studyThis is the first systematic study and meta-analysis to estimate the proportion of the global population willing to be vaccinated against vs. intending to refuse a vaccine when COVID-19 vaccines become available and how this trend has changed over time, using large and nationally representative samples. Results indicate that COVID-19 vaccination intentions vary substantially across countries, the percentage of the population intending to be vaccinated has declined across countries as the pandemic has progressed (March-May estimate: 79%, June-October estimate: 60%) and a growing number report intending to refuse a vaccine, when available (March-May estimate: 12%, June-October estimate: 20%). There is consistent socio-demographic patterning of vaccination intentions; being female, younger, of lower income or education level and belonging to an ethnic minority group are associated with a reduced likelihood of intending to be vaccinated when a vaccine become available.

Implications of all the available evidenceIntentions to vaccinate against COVID-19 among the general public when a vaccine becomes available have been declining and this will limit the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination programmes. Findings highlight the need to improve public acceptability, trust and concern over the safety and benefit of COVID-19 vaccines and target vaccine uptake in disadvantaged groups who have already been disproportionately affected by the pandemic.","Robinson, E.; Jones, A.; Lesser, I.; Daly, M.",2020-12-03,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.12.01.20241729,1,Eric Robinson,University of Liverpool,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.01.20241729v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.01.20241729v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.02.005
22115,The protective association between statins use and adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"IntroductionStatins may reduce a cytokine storm, which has been hypothesized as a possible mechanism of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to report on adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients by statin usage.

MethodsLiteratures were searched from January 2019 to December 2020 to identify studies that reported the association between statin usage and adverse outcomes, including mortality, ICU admissions, and mechanical ventilation. Studies were meta-analyzed for mortality by the subgroups of ICU status and statin usage before and after COVID-19 hospitalization. Studies reporting an odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) were analyzed separately.

ResultsThirteen cohorts, reporting on 110,078 patients, were included in this meta-analysis. Individuals who used statins before their COVID-19 hospitalization showed a similar risk of mortality, compared to those who did not use statins (HR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.28; OR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.38, 1.03). Patients who were administered statins after their COVID-19 diagnosis were at a lower risk of mortality (HR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.61; OR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.75). The use of statins did not reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU (OR 0.65; 95% CI: 0.26, 1.64). Among non-ICU patients, statin users were at a lower risk of mortality relative to non-statin users (HR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.62; OR 0.64, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.88).

ConclusionPatients administered statins after COVID-19 diagnosis or non-ICU admitted patients were at lower risk of mortality relative to non-statin users.","Chow, R.; Im, J.; Chiu, N.; Chiu, L.; Aggarwal, R.; Lee, J.; Choi, Y.-G.; Prsic, E.

2750,Response and role of palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic: a national telephone survey of hospices in Italy,"BackgroundPalliative care is an important component of healthcare in pandemics, contributing to symptom control, psychological support, and supporting triage and complex decision making.

AimTo examine preparedness for, and impact of, the COVID-19 pandemic on hospices in Italy to inform the response in other countries.

DesignCross-sectional telephone survey, carried out in March 2020.

SettingSixteen Italian hospices, purposively sampled according to COVID-19 risk into high (more than 25 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants), medium (15-25 cases per 100,000), and low risk (fewer than 15 cases per 100,000) regions. A brief questionnaire was developed to guide the interviews. Descriptive analysis was undertaken.

ResultsSeven high risk, five medium risk and four low risk hospices provided data. Two high risk hospices had experienced COVID-19 cases among both patients and staff. All hospices had implemented policy changes, and several had rapidly implemented changes in practice including transfer of staff from inpatient to community settings, change in admission criteria, and daily telephone support for families. Concerns included scarcity of personal protective equipment, a lack of hospice-specific guidance on COVID-19, anxiety about needing to care for children and other relatives, and poor integration of palliative care in the acute setting.

ConclusionThe hospice sector is capable of responding flexibly and rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments must urgently recognise the essential contribution of hospice and palliative care to the COVID-19 pandemic, and ensure these services are integrated into the health care system response. Availability of personal protective equipment and setting-specific guidance is essential.

16598,SARS-CoV-2 sequencing reveals rapid transmission from college student clusters resulting in morbidity and deaths in vulnerable populations,"College reopening decisions during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represent a trade-off between competing risks to students, faculty and staff, and college finances. Additionally, risks taken in reopening colleges can impose significant burdens on individuals living in surrounding communities. Many colleges that reopened for in-person instruction have reported frequent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. La Crosse County, Wisconsin experienced a substantial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (2,002 cases in September 2020) that coincided with the return to in-person instruction at three local academic institutions. Genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 cases in La Crosse during that period found rapid expansion of two viral substrains. Although the majority of cases were among college-age individuals, from a total of 111 genomes sequenced we identified rapid transmission of the virus into more vulnerable populations. Eight sampled genomes represented two independent transmission events into two skilled nursing facilities, resulting in two fatalities. Our study highlights the very significant risks imposed by college administrator reopening decisions, not just on college-associated populations, but on vulnerable individuals in surrounding communities.","Richmond, C.

9663,Impact on mental health care and on mental health service users of the COVID-19 pandemic: a mixed methods survey of UK mental health care staff,"PurposeThe COVID-19 pandemic has potential to disrupt and burden the mental health care system, and to magnify inequalities experienced by mental health service users.

MethodsWe investigated staff reports regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in its early weeks on mental health care and mental health service users in the UK using a mixed methods online survey. Recruitment channels included professional associations and networks, charities and social media. Quantitative findings were reported with descriptive statistics, and content analysis conducted for qualitative data.

Results2,180 staff from a range of sectors, professions and specialties participated. Immediate infection control concerns were highly salient for inpatient staff, new ways of working for community staff. Multiple rapid adaptations and innovations in response to the crisis were described, especially remote working. This was cautiously welcomed but found successful in only some clinical situations. Staff had specific concerns about many groups of service users, including people whose conditions are exacerbated by pandemic anxieties and social disruptions; people experiencing loneliness, domestic abuse and family conflict; those unable to understand and follow social distancing requirements; and those who cannot engage with remote care.

ConclusionThis overview of staff concerns and experiences in the early COVID-19 pandemic suggests directions for further research and service development: we suggest that how to combine infection control and a therapeutic environment in hospital, and how to achieve effective and targeted tele-health implementation in the community, should be priorities. The limitations of our convenience sample must be noted.","Johnson, S.; Dalton-Locke, C.; Vera San Juan, N.; Foye, U.; Oram, S.; Papamichail, A.; Landau, S.; Rowan Olive, R.; Jeynes, T.; Shah, P.; Sheridan Rains, L.; Lloyd-Evans, B.; Carr, S.; Killaspy, H.; Gillard, S.; Simpson, A.; The Covid-19 Mental Health Policy Research Unit Group,  ",2020-06-22,Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology,10.1101/2020.06.12.20129494,3,Christian Dalton-Locke,"NIHR Mental Health Policy Research Unit, Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, UK",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.20129494v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.20129494v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1007/s00127-020-01927-4
20885,"SARS-Cov-2 prevalence, transmission, health-related outcomes and control strategies in homeless shelters: systematic review and meta-analysis","BackgroundPeople experiencing homelessness (PEH) may be at particular risk for COVID19. We synthesised the evidence on SARS-Cov-2 infection, transmission, outcomes of disease, effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), and the effectiveness of targeted strategies for infection prevention and control (IPC).

MethodsSystematic review of articles, reports and grey-literature indexed in electronic databases (EMBASE, WHO-Covid19, Web of Science), pre-print repositories, institutional websites, and handsearching. Empirical papers of any study design addressing Covid-19 in PEH or homeless shelters staff in English were included. (PROSPERO 2020 CRD42020187033)

FindingsOf 194 publications, 13 studies were included (two modelling, ten observational and one qualitative study). All were conducted in high-income countries. Random-effect meta-analysis of prevalence estimates yields a baseline SARS-Cov-2 prevalence of 2{middle dot}14% (95% Confidence-Interval, 95%CI=1{middle dot}02-3{middle dot}27) in PEH and 1{middle dot}72 % (95%CI=0{middle dot}31-3{middle dot}12) in staff. In outbreaks, the pooled prevalence increases to 29{middle dot}49% (95%CI=16{middle dot}44-29{middle dot}55) in PEH and 15{middle dot}18% (95%CI=8{middle dot}95-21{middle dot}42) in staff. Main IPC strategies were universal and rapid testing, expansion of non-congregate housing support, and individual measures in shelters (bed spacing, limited staff rotation).

InterpretationUp to 30% PEH and 17% staff are infected during outbreaks of SARS-Cov-2 in homeless shelters. Most studies were conducted in the USA. No studies were found on health-related outcomes or health effects of NPI. An overview and evaluation of IPC strategies for PEH, including a better understanding of disease transmission, and reliable data on PEH within Covid-19 notification systems is needed. Qualitative studies may serve to voice PEH experiences and guide future evaluations and IPC strategies.

FundingNo source of funding.

Panel 1: Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPeople experiencing homelessness (PEH) are at increased risk of infectious, chronic, and mental health adverse conditions. Due to the risk of transmission in shared accommodations, PEH may be particularly vulnerable to SARS-Cov-2 infection and worse clinical outcomes. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) taken to mitigate the SARS-Cov-2 outbreak may have further aggravated health and social conditions. However, there is no evidence synthesis on the SARS-Cov-2 epidemiology among PEH, the correspondent clinical and other health-related outcomes as well as health effects of NPIs on these groups.

Added value of this study

We reviewed and synthesized existent evidence on the risk of infection and transmission, risk of severe course of disease, effect of NPIs on health outcomes and the effectiveness of implemented measures to avert risks and negative outcomes among PEH. Results of the identified studies suggest that both PEH and shelter staff are at high risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection, especially in case of a local outbreak. Due to the low prevalence of symptoms at the time of a positive SARS-Cov-2 test among PEH, symptom screening alone may not be efficient to control outbreaks. Instead, universal and rapid testing conjugated with expansion of non-congregate housing support, and individual measures in shelters, are discussed as sensible strategies.

Implications of all the available evidence

A comprehensive overview of NPIs and shelter strategies targeting PEH and evaluation of their effectiveness and unintended health consequences is needed. Qualitative research considering living realities of PEH can facilitate understanding of their specific needs during the pandemic.","Mohsenpour, A.

5591,Pneumask: Modified Full-Face Snorkel Masks as Reusable Personal Protective Equipment for Hospital Personnel,"Here we adapt and evaluate a full-face snorkel mask for use as personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers, who lack appropriate alternatives during the COVID-19 crisis in the spring of 2020. The design (referred to as Pneumask) consists of a custom snorkel-specific adapter that couples the snorkel-port of the mask to a rated filter (either a medical-grade ventilator inline filter or an industrial filter). This design has been tested for the sealing capability of the mask, filter performance, CO2 buildup and clinical usability. These tests found the Pneumask capable of forming a seal that exceeds the standards required for half-face respirators or N95 respirators. Filter testing indicates a range of options with varying performance depending on the quality of filter selected, but with typical filter performance exceeding or comparable to the N95 standard. CO2 buildup was found to be roughly equivalent to levels found in half-face elastomeric respirators in literature. Clinical usability tests indicate sufficient visibility and, while speaking is somewhat muffled, this can be addressed via amplification (Bluetooth voice relay to cell phone speakers through an app) in noisy environments. We present guidance on the assembly, usage (donning and doffing) and decontamination protocols. The benefit of the Pneumask as PPE is that it is reusable for longer periods than typical disposable N95 respirators, as the snorkel mask can withstand rigorous decontamination protocols (that are standard to regular elastomeric respirators). With the dire worldwide shortage of PPE for medical personnel, our conclusions on the performance and efficacy of Pneumask as an N95-alternative technology are cautiously optimistic.

Key pointsFull-face snorkel masks are adapted for use as Personal Protective Equipment during the COVID-19 crisis, using a custom adapter that facilitates the attachment of inline medical-grade respiratory filters or NIOSH industrial respirator filters. This solution was designed as a reusable stopgap solution for healthcare workers to help address the short-term global N95 respirator shortage.","Kroo, L.; Kothari, A.; Hannebelle, M.; Herring, G.; Pollina, T.; Chang Md, R.; Banavar, S.

Here, we validated and investigated the usefulness of measuring serum antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using the iFlash3000 CLIA analyzer. We measured IgM and IgG titers against SARS-CoV-2 in sera collected from 26 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients, 53 COVID-19-suspected but PCR-negative patients, and 20 and 100 randomly selected non-COVID-19 patients who visited our hospital in 2020 and 2017, respectively. The within-day and between-day precisions were regarded as good, since the coefficient variations were below 5%. Linearity was also considered good between 0.6 AU/mL and 112.7 AU/mL for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and between 3.2 AU/mL and 55.3 AU/mL for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, while the linearity curves plateaued above the upper measurement range. We also confirmed that the seroconversion and no-antibody titers were over the cutoff values in all 100 serum samples collected in 2017. These results indicate that this measurement system successfully detects SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG. We observed four false-positive cases in the IgM assay and no false-positive cases in the IgG assay when 111 serum samples known to contain autoantibodies were evaluated. The concordance rates of the antibody test with the PCR test were 98.1% for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and 100% for IgG among PCR-negative cases and 30.8% for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and 73.1% for SARS-CoV-2 IgG among PCR-positive cases.

2987,Aerosol and Surface Transmission Potential of SARS-CoV-2,"Summary ParagraphThe novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated in Wuhan, China4 in late 2019, and its resulting coronavirus disease, COVID-19, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The rapid global spread of COVID-19 represents perhaps the most significant public health emergency in a century. As the pandemic progressed, a continued paucity of evidence on routes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission has resulted in shifting infection prevention and control guidelines between clasically-defined airborne and droplet precautions. During the initial isolation of 13 individuals with COVID-19 at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, we collected air and surface samples to examine viral shedding from isolated individuals. We detected viral contamination among all samples, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 may spread through both direct (droplet and person-to-person) as well as indirect mechanisms (contaminated objects and airborne transmission). Taken together, these finding support the use of airborne isolation precautions when caring for COVID-19 patients.","Santarpia, J. L.; Rivera, D. N.; Herrera, V.; Morwitzer, M.

18235,Association between climate and new daily diagnoses of COVID-19,"BackgroundAlthough evidence is accumulating that climate conditions may positively or negatively influence the scale of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks, uncertainty remains concerning the real impact of climate factors on viral transmission. Methods. The number of new daily cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in Verona (Italy) was retrieved from the official website of Veneto Region, while information on daily weather parameters in the same area was downloaded from IlMeteo website, a renowned Italian technological company specialized in weather forecasts. The search period ranged between March 1 to November 11, 2020. The number of new daily COVID-19 cases and meteorological data in Verona were correlated using both univariate and multivariate analysis.

ResultsThe number of daily COVID-19 diagnoses in Verona was positively associated with the number of days in lockdown and humidity, and inversely correlated with mean, min and max temperature, mean wind speed and number of days with rainfall. Days of lockdown, mean air temperature, humidity, mean wind speed and number of days with rainfall remained significantly associated in multivariate analysis. The four weather parameters contributed to explaining 61% of variance in new daily COVID-19 diagnoses. Each 1% increase in air temperature, 1% decrease in humidity, 1 km/h increase in wind speed and day with rainfall were independently associated with 1.0%, 0.3%, 1.2% and 5.4% reduction in new COVID-19 daily diagnoses. A significant difference was observed in values of all-weather parameters recorded in Verona between days with <100 or [&ge;]100 new daily COVID-19diagnoses.

ConclusionsClimate conditions may play an essential role in conditions of viral transmission, and influence the likelihood or course of local outbreaks. Preventive measures, testing policies and hospital preparedness should be reinforced during periods of higher meteorological risk and in local environments with adverse climate conditions.","Mattiuzzi, C.; Henry, B.

13643,On the use of growth models for forecasting epidemic outbreaks with application to COVID-19 data,"The initial phase dynamics of an epidemic without containment measures is commonly well modeled using exponential growth models. However, in the presence of containment measures, the exponential model becomes less appropriate. Under the implementation of an isolation measure for detected infectives, we propose to model epidemic dynamics by fitting a flexible growth model curve to reported positive cases and to infer the overall epidemic dynamics by introducing information on the detection/testing effort and recovery and death rates. The resulting modeling approach is close to the SIQR (Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered) model framework. We focused on predicting the peaks (time and size) in positive cases, actives cases and new infections. We applied the approach to data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. Fits on limited data before the observed peaks illustrate the ability of the flexible growth model to approach the estimates from the whole data.","Tovissode, C. F.; Lokonon, B.

8619,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies with a cell-free PCR assay,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to more than 4 million confirmed infections worldwide and over 300,000 deaths. While Remdesivir has recently received FDA emergency use authorization for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, convalescent plasma (CP) with high titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) from recovered donors remains a promising and widely accessible method to mitigate severe disease symptoms. Here, we describe the development and validation of a cell-free neutralization PCR assay using SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 and human ACE2 receptor-DNA conjugates. By comparing with samples collected prior to the outbreak, we confirmed that NAbs were specifically detected in COVID-19 cases. Using our unique assay, the NAb signals are detectable as early as 10 days after onset of symptoms and continue to rise, plateauing after 18 days. Notably, we showed that the use of a licensed pathogen reduction technology to inactivate potentially contaminating infectious pathogens in CP did not alter NAb signals, paving a path to safely administer effective CP therapies. The described neutralization PCR assay can serve as a qualification tool to easily identify suitable CP donors of a potentially lifesaving therapy. In addition, this assay tool is readily deployable in standard laboratories with biosafety level 2 capability, and can yield results within 2-3 hrs. This advancement can facilitate research on factors driving diverse COVID-19 disease manifestations, help evaluate the impact of various CP processing protocols on CP therapeutic efficacy and assist in accelerating vaccine efficacy assessment.","Danh, K.; Karp, D.

21267,An Online Risk Calculator for Rapid Prediction of In-hospital Mortality from COVID-19 Infection,"Prediction of mortality from COVID-19 infection might help triage patients to hospitalization and intensive care. To estimate the risk of inpatient mortality, we analyzed the data of 13,190 adult patients in the New York City Health + Hospitals system admitted for COVID-19 infection from March 1 to June 30, 2020. They had a mean age 58 years, 40% were Latinx, 29% Black, 9% White and 22% of other races/ethnicities and 2,875 died. We used Machine learning (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees; XGBoost) to select predictors of inpatient mortality from demographics, vital signs and lab tests results from initial encounters. XGBoost identified O2 saturation, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, age, and BUN with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve = 94%. We applied CART to find cut-points in these variables, logistic regression to calculate odds-ratios for those categories, and assigned points to the categories to develop a score. A score = 0 indicates a 0.8% (95% confidence interval, 0.5 - 1.0%) risk of dying and [&ge;] 12 points indicates a 98% (97-99%) risk, and other scores have intermediate risks. We translated the models into an online calculator for the probability of mortality with 95% confidence intervals (as pictured):

4324,COVID-19 outbreak at a large homeless shelter in Boston: Implications for universal testing,"The circumstances of homelessness create the potential for rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in this vulnerable population. Upon observing a cluster of COVID-19 cases from a single large homeless shelter in Boston, Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program conducted symptom assessments and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 among all guests residing at the shelter over a 2-day period. Of 408 participants, 147 (36.0%) were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. COVID-positive individuals were more likely to be male (p<0.001) but did not differ significantly from COVID-negative individuals with respect to other demographic and clinical characteristics. Cough (7.5%), shortness of breath (1.4%), and fever (0.7%) were all uncommon among COVID-positive individuals. Our findings illustrate the rapidity with which COVID-19 can be widely transmitted in a homeless shelter setting and suggest that universal PCR testing, rather than a symptom triggered approach, may be a better strategy for identifying and mitigating COVID-19 among people experiencing homelessness.","Baggett, T.

25465,Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Park Use in U.S. Cities,"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic focused attention on city parks as important public resources. However, it is unknown how city park use in 2020 compared to prior years and whether COVID-19 may have exacerbated racial/ethnic inequities in access. Moreover, traditional methods of measuring park use present major drawbacks.

MethodsWe analyzed monthly mobility data derived from a large panel of smartphone devices, cross-referenced with a database of parks locations sourced from local agencies. We assessed park use trends in 44 of the 50 most populous U.S. cities from January 2018 to November 2020 using interrupted time series regressions. We also compared parks to other city amenities (e.g., gyms and libraries).

ResultsBased on a sample of 5,559 city parks, park visits declined by 14.6% (95% CI [9.2, 19.7], p < 0.001) from March through November 2020, compared to prior levels and trends. When we segmented the COVID-19 period by time of widespread closures (March-April) and partial-to-full reopenings (May-November), we estimated a larger reduction during closures (35.7% reduction, 95% CI [33.5, 37.8], p < 0.001) compared to the reduction during reopenings (8.0% reduction, 95% CI [1.9, 13.7], p = 0.001). Reductions for other amenities were more prolonged. In park service areas where a greater proportion of residents were White, reopening was associated with more visits, suggesting that racial privilege influenced access.

ConclusionsSmartphone mobility data can address a data availability gap for monitoring park use. Park use only declined modestly in 2020. Opportunities exist to make access more racially equitable.

Significance statementParks are public resources that promote health. Little is known about how parks have been used during the COVID-19 pandemic, when parks have become particularly important public spaces. This study introduces an approach to monitor park use over time, using location data from smartphones. This approach enabled the authors to evaluate trends in park use during the pandemic, including major gaps in visits to parks according to whether they mostly served White residents or residents of color. This big data approach offers advantages over traditional methods for monitoring park use and can help city officials to identify and address inequities in park access.","Jay, J.; Heykoop, F.; Hwang, L.; De Jong, J.; Kondo, M.",2021-04-25,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.04.23.21256007,1,Jonathan Jay,Boston University School of Public Health,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.23.21256007v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.23.21256007v1.full.pdf,cc0,NA
17607,Forecasting new daily confirmed cases infected by COVID-19 in Italy from April 9th to May 18th 2020,"We aim at forecasting the outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy by using a two-part time series to model the daily relative increments. Our model is based on the data observed from 22 February to 8 April 2020 and its objective is forecasting 40 days from 9 April to 18 May 2020. All the calculations, simulations, and results in the present paper have been done in MatLab R2015b. The average curve and 80% upper and lower bounds are calculated based on 100 simulations of the fitted models. According to our model, it is expected that by May 18th, 2020, the relative increment (RI) falls to the interval of 0.31% to 1.24% (average equal to 0.78%). During the last three days of the studied period, the RI belonged to the interval 2.5% to 3%. Accordingly, It is expected that the new daily confirmed cases face a decreasing to around 1900 on average. Finally, our prediction establishes that the cumulative number of confirmed cases reaches 237635 (with 80% confidence interval equal to [226340 248417] by May 18th, 2020.","Jamshidi, B.; Talaei-Khoei, A.; Jamshidi Zargaran, S.; Rezaei, M.",2020-11-04,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.10.30.20223222,1,Babak Jamshidi,Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.20223222v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.20223222v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA

7299,Analytical performance of lateral flow immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 exposure screening on venous and capillary blood samples,"ObjectivesNumerous serologic immunoassays have been launched to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, including rapid tests. Here, we validate use of a lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) intended for rapid screening and qualitative detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG in serum, plasma, and whole blood, and compare results with ELISA. We also seek to establish the value of LFI testing on blood obtained from a capillary blood sample.

MethodsSamples collected by venous blood draw and capillary finger stick were obtained from patients with SARS-CoV-2 detected by RT-qPCR and control patients negative for SARS-CoV-2. Samples were tested with the 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold) lateral flow immunoassay, and antibody calls were compared with results obtained by ELISA.

ResultsThe Biolidics LFI kit shows clinical sensitivity of 92% at 7 days after PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 on venous blood. Test specificity was 92% for IgM and 100% for IgG. There was no significant difference in detecting IgM and IgG with Biolidics LFI and ELISA at D0 and D7 (p=1.00), except for detection of IgM at D7 (p=0.04). Finger stick whole blood of SARS-CoV-2 patients showed 93% sensitivity for antibody detection.

ConclusionsClinical performance of Biolidics 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold) is comparable to ELISA and showed consistent results across different sample types. Furthermore, we show that capillary blood obtained by finger stick shows similar sensitivity for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies as venous blood samples. This provides an opportunity for decentralized rapid testing in the community and may allow point-of-care and longitudinal self-testing for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","Black, M.

21234,An interactive COVID-19 virus Mutation Tracker (CovMT) with a particular focus on critical mutations in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) region of the Spike protein,"Almost one year has passed since the appearance of SARS-CoV-2, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of confirmed SARS-Cov-2 cases worldwide has now reached [~]92 million, with 2 million reported deaths (https://covid19.who.int). Nearly 400,000 SARS-Cov-2 genomes were sequenced from COVID-19 samples and added to public resources such as GISAID (https://gisaid.org). With the vaccines becoming available or entering trials (https://covid19.trackvaccines.org), it is vital to keep track of mutations in the genome of SARS-CoV-2, especially in the Spike proteins Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) region, which could have a potential impact on disease severity and treatment strategies.1-3 In the wake of a recent increase in cases with a potentially more infective RBD mutation (N501Y) in the United Kingdom, countries worldwide are concerned about the spread of this or similar variants. Impressive sampling and timely increase in sequencing efforts related to COVID-19 in the United Kingdom (UK) helped detect and monitor the spread of the new N501Y variant. Similar sequencing efforts are needed in other countries for timely tracking of this or different variants.

8319,Can herd immunity be achieved without breaking ICUs?,"The current COVID-19 pandemic led to the rapid overload of Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in countries where the outbreaks was not quickly controlled.

The containment measures put in place to control the outbreaks had a huge social and economic impacts, and countries are looking for strategies to relax these measures while maintaining the R0 close or below 1, in an attempt to safely reach herd immunity.

In this paper we analyse the feasibility of reaching herd immunity without saturating ICUs across countries. We provide an online tool, available at www.about-the-curve.net that simulates the time required for such a scenario with a SIR model. For United States, we find that a minimum of 5 months would be required, 22 months for UK, 1 year for Italy and 9 months for Belgium.

14580,The role of masks in reducing the risk of new waves of COVID-19 in low transmission settings: a modeling study,"ObjectivesTo evaluate the risk of a new wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a setting with ongoing low transmission, high mobility, and an effective test-and-trace system, under different assumptions about mask uptake.

DesignWe used a stochastic agent-based microsimulation model to create multiple simulations of possible epidemic trajectories that could eventuate over a five-week period following prolonged low levels of community transmission.

SettingWe calibrated the model to the epidemiological and policy environment in New South Wales, Australia, at the end of August 2020.

ParticipantsNone

InterventionFrom September 1, 2020, we ran the stochastic model with the same initial conditions(i.e., those prevailing at August 31, 2020), and analyzed the outputs of the model to determine the probability of exceeding a given number of new diagnoses and active cases within five weeks, under three assumptions about future mask usage: a baseline scenario of 30% uptake, a scenario assuming no mask usage, and a scenario assuming mandatory mask usage with near-universal uptake (95%).

Main outcome measureProbability of exceeding a given number of new diagnoses and active cases within five weeks.

ResultsThe policy environment at the end of August is sufficient to slow the rate of epidemic growth, but may not stop the epidemic from growing: we estimate a 20% chance that NSW will be diagnosing at least 50 new cases per day within five weeks from the date of this analysis. Mandatory mask usage would reduce this to 6-9%.

ConclusionsMandating the use of masks in community settings would significantly reduce the risk of epidemic resurgence.","Stuart, R. M.; Abeysuriya, R. G.; Kerr, C. C.; Mistry, D.; Klein, D.

21382,"Estimates of global SARS-CoV-2 infection exposure, infection morbidity, and infection mortality rates","We aimed to estimate, albeit crudely and provisionally, national, regional, and global proportions of respective populations that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and to assess infection morbidity and mortality rates, factoring both documented and undocumented infections. The estimates were generated by applying mathematical models to 159 countries and territories. The percentage of the worlds population that has been infected as of 31 December 2020 was estimated at 12.56% (95% CI: 11.17-14.05%). It was lowest in the Western Pacific Region at 0.66% (95% CI: 0.59-0.75%) and highest in the Americas at 41.92% (95% CI: 37.95-46.09%). The global infection fatality rate was 10.73 (95% CI: 10.21-11.29) per 10,000 infections. Globally per 1,000 infections, the infection acute-care bed hospitalization rate was 19.22 (95% CI: 18.73-19.51), the infection ICU bed hospitalization rate was 4.14 (95% CI: 4.10-4.18), the infection severity rate was 6.27 (95% CI: 6.18-6.37), and the infection criticality rate was 2.26 (95% CI: 2.24-2.28). If left unchecked with no interventions, the pandemic would eventually cause 8.18 million (95% CI: 7.30-9.18) deaths, 163.67 million (95% CI: 148.12-179.51) acute-care hospitalizations, 33.01 million (95% CI: 30.52-35.70) ICU hospitalizations, 50.23 million (95% CI: 46.24-54.67) severe cases, and 17.62 million (95% CI: 16.36-18.97) critical cases. The global population remains far below the herd immunity threshold and at risk of repeated waves of infection.

17224,Estimating the Case Fatality Ratio for COVID-19 using a Time-Shifted Distribution Analysis,"Estimating the case fatality ratio (CFR) for COVID-19 is an important aspect of public health. However, calculating CFR accurately is problematic early in a novel disease outbreak, due to uncertainties regarding the time course of disease and difficulties in diagnosis and reporting of cases. In this work, we present a simple method for calculating the case fatality ratio using only public case and death data over time by exploiting the correspondence between the time distributions of cases and deaths. The time-shifted distribution (TSD) analysis generates two parameters of interest: the delay time between reporting of cases and deaths and the case fatality ratio. These parameters converge reliably over time once the exponential growth phase has finished. Analysis is performed for early COVID-19 outbreaks in many countries, and we discuss corrections to CFR values using excess-death and seroprevalence data to estimate the infection fatality ratio (IFR). While CFR values range from 0.2-20% in different countries, estimates for IFR are mostly around 0.5-0.8% for countries that experienced moderate outbreaks and 1-3% for severe outbreaks. The simplicity and transparency of TSD analysis enhance its usefulness in characterizing a new disease as well as the state of the health and reporting systems.","Thomas, B. S.; Marks, N.

17046,SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics in acute infections,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by viral proliferation and clearance phases and can be followed by low-level viral RNA shedding. The dynamics of viral RNA concentration, particularly in the early stages of infection, can inform clinical measures and interventions such as test-based screening.

MethodsWe used prospective longitudinal RT-qPCR testing to measure the viral RNA trajectories for 68 individuals during the resumption of the 2019-20 National Basketball Association season. For 46 individuals with acute infections, we inferred the peak viral concentration and the duration of the viral proliferation and clearance phases.

FindingsOn average, viral RNA concentrations peaked 2.7 days (95% credible interval [1.2, 3.8]) after first detection at a cycle threshold value of 22.4 [20.6, 24.1]. The viral clearance phase lasted longer for symptomatic individuals (10.5 days [6.5, 14.0]) than for asymptomatic individuals (6.7 days [3.2, 9.2]). A second test within 2 days after an initial positive PCR substantially improves certainty about a patients infection phase. The effective sensitivity of a test intended to identify infectious individuals declines substantially with test turnaround time.

InterpretationSARS-CoV-2 viral concentrations peak rapidly regardless of symptoms. Sequential tests can help reveal a patients progress through infection stages. Frequent rapid-turnaround testing is needed to effectively screen individuals before they become infectious.

Chan School of Public Health (YHG).

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics affect clinical and public health measures, informing patient care, testing algorithms, contact tracing protocols, and clinical trial design. We searched Web of Science using the search terms """"ALL = ((SARS-CoV-2 OR COVID-19) AND (viral OR RNA) AND (load OR concentration OR shedding) AND (dynamic* OR kinetic* OR trajector*))"""" which returned 83 references. Of these, 22 were not pertinent to within-host SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics. The remaining 61 studies tracked SARS-CoV-2 viral trajectories in a variety of geographic locations and patient populations. Together, these studies report that viral titers normally peak at or before the onset of symptoms and that a long tail of intermittent positive tests can follow a period of acute infection. Plasma but not nasopharyngeal viral concentration is associated with increased disease severity. Most studies tracked hospitalized patients after the onset of symptoms. Two of the studies tracked pre-symptomatic and/or asymptomatic patients, but these were too sparsely sampled to clearly discern viral dynamics during the earliest stage of infection.

Added value of this studyWe implemented prospective longitudinal real time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of individuals during the resumption of the 2019-20 National Basketball Association season. This allowed us to explicitly measure viral titers during the full course of 46 acute infections. Consistent with other studies, we find that peak viral concentrations do not differ substantially between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals but that symptomatic individuals take longer to clear the virus than asymptomatic individuals. For both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, viral titers normally peak within 3 days of the first positive test. This study is the first to describe the time course of viral concentrations during the earliest stage of infection when individuals are most likely to be infectious.

Implications of all the available evidenceSymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals follow similar SARS-CoV-2 viral trajectories. Due to the rapid progression from first possible detection to peak viral concentration, frequent rapid-turnaround testing is needed to screen individuals prior to them becoming infectious.","Kissler, S.

Study designA synthetic population of Rangareddy district, Telangana state, India, with 5,48,323 agents and simulated using an ABM approach for three different scenarios.

MethodsThe patterns and trends of the COVID-19 in terms of infected, admitted, critical cases requiring intensive care and/ or ventilator support, mortality and recovery were examined. The model was simulated over a period of 365 days for a no lockdown scenario and two Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention (NPI) scenarios i.e., 50% lockdown and 75% lockdown scenarios.

ResultsResults revealed that the peak values and slope of the curve declined as NPI became more stringent. The peak values could facilitate policymakers to plan the required capacity to accommodate influx of hospitalizations.

ConclusionsABM provides better insight into projections compared to compartmental models. The results could provide a platform for researchers and modelers to explore using ABM approach for COVID-19 projections with inclusion of interventions and health system preparedness.","Ms, N.; Jammy, G.

6866,Robust ACE2 protein expression localizes to the motile cilia of the respiratory tract epithelia and is not increased by ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers,"We investigated the expression and subcellular localization of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), within the upper (nasal) and lower (pulmonary) respiratory tracts of healthy human donors. We detected ACE2 protein expression within the cilia organelle of ciliated airway epithelial cells, which likely represents the initial or early subcellular site of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry during respiratory transmission. We further determined whether ACE2 expression in the cilia of upper respiratory cells was influenced by patient demographics, clinical characteristics, co-morbidities, or medication use, and found no evidence that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) increases ACE2 protein expression.","Lee, I.

4035,Making sense of the Global Coronavirus Data: The role of testing rates in understanding the pandemic and our exit strategy,"The Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) outbreak has caused havoc across the world. Subsequently, research on COVID-19 has focused on number of cases and deaths and predicted projections have focused on these parameters. We propose that the number of tests performed is a very important denominator in understanding the COVID-19 data. We analysed the number of diagnostic tests performed in proportion to the number of cases and subsequently deaths across different countries and projected pandemic outcomes.

We obtained real time COVID-19 data from the reference website Worldometer at 0900 BST on Saturday 4th April, 2020 and collated the information obtained on the top 50 countries with the highest number of COVID 19 cases. We analysed this data according to the number of tests performed as the main denominator. Country wise population level pandemic projections were extrapolated utilising three models - 1) inherent case per test and death per test rates at the time of obtaining the data (4/4/2020 0900 BST) for each country; 2) rates adjusted according to the countries who conducted at least 100000 tests and 3) rates adjusted according to South Korea.

We showed that testing rates impact on the number of cases and deaths and ultimately on future projections for the pandemic across different countries. We found that countries with the highest testing rates per population have the lowest death rates and give us an early indication of an eventual COVID-19 mortality rate. It is only by continued testing on a large scale that will enable us to know if the increasing number of patients who are seriously unwell in hospitals across the world are the tip of the iceberg or not. Accordingly, obtaining this information through a rapid increase in testing globally is the only way which will enable us to exit the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce economic and social instability.","Potluri, R.; Lavu, D.",2020-04-11,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.06.20054239,1,Rahul Potluri,ACALM Big Data Research Group,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20054239v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20054239v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
7031,Behaviors and attitudes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: Insights from a cross-national Facebook survey,"In the absence of medical treatment and vaccination, individual behaviours are key to controlling the spread of COVID-19. We developed a rapid response monitoring system through an online survey (the """"COVID-19 Health Behavior Survey""""). Participant recruitment takes places continuously via Facebook in eight countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States). The survey collects key information on peoples health, attitudes, behaviours, and social contacts. In this paper, we present results based on a total of 71,612 completed questionnaires, collected between March 13-April 19, 2020. We find sex-specific patterns, as women show higher threat perceptions, lower confidence in the healthcare system, and a higher likelihood of adopting preventive behaviours. Our findings also show higher awareness and concern among older respondents. Finally, we find spatio-temporal heterogeneity in threat perception, confidence in organisations, and adoption of preventive behaviours.","Perrotta, D.; Grow, A.; Rampazzo, F.; Cimentada, J.; Del Fava, E.; Gil-Clavel, S.; Zagheni, E.",2020-07-15,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.05.09.20096388,2,Daniela Perrotta,"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Germany",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.09.20096388v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.09.20096388v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
13262,"SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence survey among 18,000 healthcare and administrative personnel at hospitals, pre-hospital services, and specialist practitioners in the Central Denmark Region","ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to perform a large seroprevalence survey on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among Danish healthcare workers to identify high risk groups.

DesignCross-sectional survey.

SettingAll healthcare workers and administrative personnel at the seven hospitals, pre-hospital services and specialist practitioner clinics in the Central Denmark Region were invited by e-mail to be tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by a commercial SARS-CoV-2 total antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co., Ltd., Beijing, China).

ParticipantsA total of 25,950 participants were invited. Of these, 17,987 (69%) showed up for blood sampling, and 17,971 had samples available for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing.

Main outcome measures1) Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; 2) Risk factors for seropositivity; 3) Association of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies.

ResultsAfter adjustment for assay sensitivity and specificity, the overall seroprevalence was 3.4% (CI: 2.5%-3.8%). The seroprevalence was higher in the western part of the region than in the eastern part (11.9% vs 1.2%, difference: 10.7 percentage points, CI: 9.5-12.2). In the high prevalence area, the emergency departments had the highest seroprevalence (29.7%) while departments without patients or with limited patient contact had the lowest seroprevalence (2.2%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis with age, sex, and profession as the predictors showed that nursing staff, medical doctors, and biomedical laboratory scientists had a higher risk than medical secretaries, who served as reference (OR = 7.3, CI: 3.5-14.9; OR = 4., CI: 1.8-8.9; and OR = 5.0, CI: 2.1-11.6, respectively).

Among the total 668 seropositive participants, 433 (64.8%) had previously been tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and 50.0% had a positive RT-PCR result. A total of 98% of individuals who had a previous positive viral RNA test were also found to be seropositive.

ConclusionsWe found large differences in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in staff working in the healthcare sector within a small geographical area of Denmark and signs of in-hospital transmission. Half of all seropositive staff had been tested positive by PCR prior to this survey. This study raises awareness of precautions which should be taken to avoid in-hospital transmission. Additionally, regular testing of healthcare workers for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered to identify areas with increased transmission.

14890,Safety and Efficacy of Antiviral Drugs for the Treatment of Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-analyses,"ObjectiveTo systematically review the safety and efficacy outcomes of using antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19.

MethodsFive databases were screened from inception to 27-Aug-2020. The effects of specific drug interventions on safety and efficacy were assessed in COVID-19 patients. Risk Ratios (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models.

ResultsA total of 10 studies were identified which fulfill the inclusion criteria. Patients taking antivirals had 26% less risk of having a severe adverse event (SAE) compared to controls (RR, 0.74, CI:0.62 to 0.89, P=0.002). Clinical improvement at day 14 was observed among the cases treated with antivirals compared to the control group (RR 1.24, CI: 1.00 to 1.53 p=0.05).

ConclusionThere is evidence that Remdesivir and LPV/r reduces the hospital length of stay and that patients to which antivirals were administered had less SAE and improvement when compared to patients not prescribed with antivirals. Due to a lack of power and the quality of the studies, it was not possible to determine which antivirals have a greater risk-benefit balance, and therefore the optimal approach to antiviral treatment is still uncertain.","Aponte Torres, Z.; Lopez-Leon, S.; Muthuvel, T.; Manivannan, S.; Srivastava, K.; Pavesi, M.",2020-09-10,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.09.03.20187526,1,Zuleika Aponte Torres,Aponte Epidemiology Consultancy,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.20187526v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.20187526v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
5997,A Simple Early Warning Signal for COVID-19,"The paper provides some initial evidence that daily mortality rates (for any cause) by municipality or province can be used as a statistically reliable predictor of looming COVID-19 crises. Using recently published deaths figures for 1,689 Italian municipalities, we estimate the growth in daily mortality rates between the period 2015-2019 and 2020 by province. All provinces that experienced a major COVID-19 shock in mid-March 2020 had increases in mortality rates of 100% or above already in early February 2020. This increase was particularly strong for males and older people, two recognizable features of COVID-19. Using a panel fixed effect model, we show that the association between these early increases in mortality for any cause and the March 2020 COVID-19 shock is strong and significant. We conclude that the growth in mortality rates can be used as a statistically reliable predictor of COVID-19 crises.","Ceriani, L.; Hernandez-Suarez, C.; Verme, P.",2020-05-05,Health Economics,10.1101/2020.04.28.20083261,1,Paolo Verme,World bank group,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20083261v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20083261v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
16667,A Neanderthal OAS1 Isoform Protects Against COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity: Results from Mendelian Randomization and Case-Control Studies,"Proteins detectable in peripheral blood may influence COVID-19 susceptibility or severity. However, understanding which circulating proteins are etiologically involved is difficult because their levels may be influenced by COVID-19 itself and are also subject to confounding factors. To identify circulating proteins influencing COVID-19 susceptibility and severity we undertook a large-scale two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study, since this study design can rapidly scan hundreds of circulating proteins and reduces bias due to reverse causation and confounding. We identified genetic determinants of 931 circulating proteins in 28,461 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected individuals, retaining only single nucleotide polymorphism near the gene encoding the circulating protein. We found that a standard deviation increase in OAS1 levels was associated with reduced COVID-19 death or ventilation (N = 4,336 cases / 623,902 controls; OR = 0.54, P = 7x10-8), COVID-19 hospitalization (N = 6,406 / 902,088; OR = 0.61, P = 8x10-8) and COVID-19 susceptibility (N = 14,134 / 1,284,876; OR = 0.78, P = 8x10-6). Results were consistent in multiple sensitivity analyses. We then measured OAS1 levels in 504 patients with repeated plasma samples (N=1039) with different COVID-19 outcomes and found that increased OAS1 levels in a non-infectious state were associated with protection against very severe COVID-19, hospitalization and susceptibility. Further analyses suggested that a Neanderthal isoform of OAS1 affords this protection. Thus, evidence from MR and a case-control study supported a protective role for OAS1 in COVID-19 outcomes. Available medicines, such as phosphodiesterase-12 inhibitors, increase OAS1 and could be explored for their effect on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.","Zhou, S.; Butler-Laporte, G.; Nakanishi, T.; Morrison, D.; Afilalo, J.; Afilalo, M.; Laurent, L.; Pietzner, M.; Kerrison, N.; Zhao, K.; Brunet-Ratnasingham, E.; Henry, D.; Kimchi, N.; Afrasiabi, Z.; Rezk, N.; Bouab, M.; Guzman, C.; Petitjean, L.; Xue, X.; Tselios, C.; Vulesevic, B.; Adeleye, O.; Abdullah, T.; Almamlouk, N.; Chen, Y.; Durand, M.; Chasse, M.; Normark, J.; Thysell, E.; Frithiof, R.; Lipcsey, M.; Hultstrom, M.; Paterson, C.; Pollak, M.; Zeberg, H.; Greenwood, C.

16761,Predictors of severe symptomatic laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 reinfection,"BackgroundThere is a major concern regarding the prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients who recovered to first-time illness.

ObjectiveTo evaluate factors predicting severe symptomatic laboratory-confirmed (reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RT-qPCR) SARS-COV-2 (severe acute coronavirus-2) reinfection.

MethodWe conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study in Mexico and data from 258 reinfection cases (at least 28 days between both episodes onset) were analyzed. We used risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to evaluate predictors of severe (dyspnea requiring hospital admission) secondary SARS-COV-2 infection.

ResultsThe risk of severe disease was 14.7% and the observed overall fatality rate was 4.3%. Patients with more serious primary disease were more likely to develop severe symptoms (39.5% vs. 5.5%, p < 0.001) during reinfection. In multiple analysis, factors associated with an increased risk of severe symptomatic SARS-COV-2 reinfection were increasing age (RR per year = 1.007, 95% CI 1.003-1.010), comorbidities (namely obesity [RR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.24], asthma [RR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.06-1.50], type 2 diabetes mellitus [RR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.07 - 1.38] and previous severe laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (RR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.03-1.39).

ConclusionsTo the best of our knowledge this is the first study evaluating disease outcomes in a large set of laboratory-positive cases of symptomatic SARS-COV-2 reinfection and factors associated with illness severity was characterized. Our results may contribute to the current knowledge of SARS-COV-2 pathogenicity and to identify populations at increased risk of a poorer outcome after reinfection.","Murillo-Zamora, E.; Mendoza-Cano, O.; Delgado-Enciso, I.; Hernandez-Suarez, C.

8953,"Association of Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), Adult Pneumococcal and Adult Seasonal Influenza Vaccines with Covid-19 Adjusted Mortality Rates in Level 4 European countries","IntroductionNon-specific effects of vaccines have gained increasing interest during the Covid-19 pandemic. In particular, population use of BCG vaccine has been associated with improved outcomes. This study sought to determine the association of population use of BCG, adult pneumococcal and adult seasonal influenza vaccination with Covid-19 mortality when adjusted for a number of confounding variables.

MethodsUsing publicly available data, mortality adjusted for the timeframe of crisis, population size and population characteristics was calculated. The primary analysis was the relationship between each of the day 15 and day 30 standardised mortality rates and BCG, adult pneumococcal and influenza vaccination scores using unadjusted measures and with adjustment for population structure and case fatality rates. Secondary analyses were measures of case increases and mortality increases from day 15 to day 30 for each of the relative vaccination scores. Finally, we also analysed the peak Z score reflecting increases in total mortality from historical averages reported by EuroMOMO (Euromomo.eu),

ResultsFollowing adjustment for the effects of population size, median age, population density, the proportion of population living in an urban setting, life-expectancy, the elderly dependency ratio (or proportion over 65 years), net migration, days from day 1 to lockdown and case-fatality rate, only BCG vaccination score remained significantly associated with Covid-19 mortality at day 30. In the best fit model, BCG vaccination score was associated with a 64% reduction in log(10) mortality per 10 million population (OR 0.362 reduction [95% CI 0.188 to 0.698]), following adjustment for population size, median age, density, urbanization, elderly dependency ratio, days to lockdown, yearly migration and case fatality rate.

ConclusionBCG vaccine was associated with reduced mortality rates in level 4 countries while adult pneumococcal and adult seasonal influenza vaccines were not when adjusted for a number of confounding variables.

DesignPopulation-based prospective cohort study on archive data.

SettingPreventive services and hospital care in the province of Reggio Emilia, Northern Italy.

ParticipantsAll 2653 symptomatic patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from February 27 to April 2, 2020 in the province of Reggio Emilia.

Main outcome measuresHospitalization and death up to April 2, 2020.

ResultsFemales had higher prevalence of infection than males below age 50 (2.61 vs. 1.84 {per thousand}), but lower in older ages (16.49 vs. 20.86 {per thousand} over age 80). Case fatality rate reached 20.7% (22/106) in cases with more than 4 weeks follow up. After adjusting for age and comorbidities, men had a higher risk of hospitalization (hazard ratio (HR) 1.4 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.2 to 1.6) and of death (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.1). Patients over age 80 compared to < age 50 had HR 7.1 (95% CI 5.4 to 9.3) and HR 27.8 (95% CI 12.5 to 61.7) for hospitalization and death, respectively. Immigrants had a higher risk of hospitalization (HR 1.3, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.81) than Italians and a similar risk of death. Risk of hospitalization and of death were higher in patients with heart failure (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.1and HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.6 to 3.2, respectively), arrhythmia (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.9 and HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.5, respectively), dementia (HR 1.2, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.8 and HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.8, respectively), ischemic heart disease (HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.7 and HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.5, respectively), diabetes (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 1.9 and HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.2, respectively), and hypertensions(HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.6 and HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.1, respectively), while COPD increased the risk of hospitalization (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.5) but not of death (HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.7). Previous use of ACE inhibitors has no effect on risk of death (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.34)

ConclusionsThe mechanisms underlying these associations are mostly unknown. A deeper understanding of the causal chain from infection, disease onset, and immune response to outcomes may explain how these prognostic factors act.","Giorgi Rossi, P.; Marino, M.; Formisano, D.; Venturelli, F.; Vicentini, M.; Grilli, R.; The Reggio Emilia Covid-19 Working Group,  ",2020-04-16,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.13.20063545,1,Francesco Venturelli,"Epidemiology unit, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063545v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063545v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1371/journal.pone.0238281
12119,Mathematical modelling of dynamics and containment of COVID-19 in Ukraine,"COVID-19 disease caused by the novel SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus has already brought unprecedented challenges for public health and resulted in huge numbers of cases and deaths worldwide. In the absence of effective vaccine, different countries have employed various other types of non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain the spread of this disease, including quarantines and lockdowns, tracking, tracing and isolation of infected individuals, and social distancing measures. Effectiveness of these and other measures of disease containment and prevention to a large degree depends on good understanding of disease dynamics, and robust mathematical models play an important role for forecasting its future dynamics. In this paper we focus on Ukraine, one of Europes largest countries, and develop a mathematical model of COVID-19 dynamics, using latest data on parameters characterising clinical features of disease. For improved accuracy, our model includes age-stratified disease parameters, as well as age- and location-specific contact matrices to represent contacts. We show that the model is able to provide an accurate short-term forecast for the numbers and age distribution of cases and deaths. We also simulated different lockdown scenarios, and the results suggest that reducing work contacts is more efficient at reducing the disease burden than reducing school contacts, or implementing shielding for people over 60.","Kyrychko, Y.; Blyuss, K.; Brovchenko, I.",2020-07-24,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.07.24.20161497,1,Yuliya Kyrychko,University of Sussex,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.20161497v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.20161497v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1038/s41598-020-76710-1
23530,A tale of three SARS-CoV-2 variants with independently acquired P681H mutations in New York State,"Several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have independently acquired some of the same Spike protein mutations - notably E484K, N501Y, S477N, and K417T - associated with increased viral transmission and/or reduced sensitivity to neutralization by antibodies. Repeated evolution of the same mutations, particularly in variants that are now rapidly spreading in various regions of the world, suggests a fitness advantage. Mutations at position P681 in Spike - possibly affecting viral transmission - have also evolved multiple times, including in two variants of concern. Here, we describe three variants circulating in New York State that have independently acquired a P681H mutation and the different trajectories they have taken. While one variant rose to high prevalence since later summer 2020 it appears to be in decline. The other two variants were more recently detected in New York and harbor additional Spike mutations that might be cause for continued monitoring. The latter two P681H variants have shown moderate increases in prevalence but ultimately all might be subject to the same fate as more competitive variants come to dominate the scene.","Lasek-Nesselquist, E.; Pata, J.; Schneider, E.; St. George, K.",2021-03-12,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.03.10.21253285,1,Erica Lasek-Nesselquist,Wadsworth Center,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.10.21253285v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.10.21253285v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
9147,Impact of Governmental interventions on epidemic progression and workplace activity during the COVID-19 outbreak,"In the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic brought the world to a state of paralysis. During this period, humanity has seen by far the largest organized travel restrictions and unprecedented efforts and global coordination to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using large scale human mobility and fine grained epidemic incidence data, we develop a framework to understand and quantify the effectiveness of the interventions implemented by various countries to control epidemic growth. Our analysis reveals the importance of timing and implementation of strategic policy in controlling the epidemic. Through our analysis, we also unearth significant spatial diffusion of the epidemic before and during the lock-down measures in several countries, casting doubt on the effectiveness or on the implementation quality of the proposed Governmental policies.","Ram, S.

11479,"Social Disadvantage, Politics, and SARS-CoV-2 Trends: A County-Level Analysis of United States Data","BackgroundUnderstanding the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for public health control efforts. Social, demographic, and political characteristics at the US county level might be associated with the trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 case incidence.

ObjectiveTo understand how underlying social, demographic, and political characteristics at the US county level might be associated with the trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 case incidence.

DesignRetrospective analysis of the trajectory of reported SARS-CoV-2 case counts at the US county level during June 1, 2020 - June 30,2020 and social, demographic, and political characteristics of the county.

SettingUnited States.

ParticipantsReported SARS-CoV-2 cases.

ExposuresMetropolitan designation, Social Deprivation Index (SDI), 2016 Republican Presidential Candidate Victory.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresSARS-CoV-2 case incidence.

Results1023/3142 US counties were included in the analysis. 678 (66.3%) had increasing SARS-CoV-2 case counts between June 1 - June 30, 2020. In univariate analysis, counties with increasing case counts had a significantly higher SDI (median 48, IQR 24 - 72) than counties with non-increasing case counts (median 40, IQR 19 - 66; p=0.009). In the multivariable model, metropolitan areas of 250,000 - 1 million population, higher percentage of Black residents and a 10-point or greater Republican victory were independently associated with increasing case counts.

LimitationsThe data examines county-level voting patterns and does not account for individual voting behavior, subjecting this work to the potential for ecologic fallacy.

ConclusionIncreasing case counts of SARS-CoV-2 in the US are likely driven by a combination of social disadvantage, social networks, and behavioral factors. Addressing social disadvantage and differential belief systems that may correspond with political alignment will be essential for pandemic control.","Mourad, A.; Turner, N. A.; Baker, A.

14569,Viral shedding and immunological features of children COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 could infect people at all ages, and the viral shedding and immunological features of children COVID-19 patients were analyzed.

MethodsEpidemiological information and clinical data were collected from 35 children patients. Viral RNAs in respiratory and fecal samples were detected. Plasma of 11 patients were collected and measured for 48 cytokines.

Results40% (14/35) of the children COVID-19 patients showed asymptomatic infections, while pneumonia shown by CT scan occurred in most of the cases (32/35, 91.43%). Elevated LDH, AST, CRP, neutropenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in some cases, and CD4 and CD8 counts were normal. A total of 22 cytokines were significantly higher than the healthy control, and IP-10, IFN-2 of them in children were significantly lower than the adult patients. Meanwhile, MCP-3, HGF, MIP-1, and IL-1ra were similar or lower than healthy control, while significantly lower than adult patients. Viral RNAs were detected as early as the first day after illness onset (d.a.o) in both the respiratory and fecal samples. Viral RNAs decreased as the disease progression and mostly became negative in respiratory samples within 18 d.a.o, while maintained relatively stable during the disease progression and still detectable in some cases during 36~42 d.a.o.

ConclusionCOVID-19 in children was mild, and asymptomatic infection was common. Immune responses were relatively normal in children COVID-19 patients. Cytokine storm also occurred in children patients, while much weaker than adult patients. Positive rate of viral RNAs in fecal samples was high, and profile of viral shedding were different between respiratory and gastrointestinal tract.","Yang, Y.; Zheng, H.; Peng, L.; Wei, J.; Wang, Y.; Li, X.; Peng, B.; Fang, S.; Zhang, M.; Liu, H.; Li, Y.; Feng, K.; Xing, L.; Wang, J.; Cao, M.; Wang, F.; Liu, Y.; Liu, L.; Yuan, J.",2020-08-31,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.25.20181446,1,Jing Yuan,Shenzhen Third People\'s Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.25.20181446v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.25.20181446v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
24706,Comparing between survived and deceased patients with Diabetes Mellitus and COVID-19 in Bangladesh: A cross- sectional study from COVID-19 dedicated hospital,"The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was reported to cause significantly higher mortality and morbidity among patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Although Bangladesh is amongst the top 10 countries with diabetic people, data on these patients with COVID-19 is scarce from this region. This study aimed to illustrate the clinical features and outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and DM in Bangladesh while comparing survivors and deceased.

This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted among RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients with pre-existing Diabetes Mellitus in a specialized COVID-19 hospital in Bangladesh. Data from hospital records were analyzed.

Among 921 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 admitted during the study period, 231 ([~]25%) patients with pre-existing DM (median age 60 years) were included in the analysis. The death rate among all hospitalized patients (with and without DM) was 2.8% compared to 11.3% among diabetic patients. The median hospital stay was 13 days (IQR 10.5, 17.0) for survivors and five days (IQR 2.0-8.3) for the deceased. The clinical features were not significantly different between survivors and the deceased. However, deceased patients had significantly lower blood oxygen level (85% vs 93%, p <0.001), and higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (7.9 vs 4.5, p 0.003) and serum ferritin (946.0 vs 425.0 ng/ml, p 0.03). Glycemic status was poor in both groups.

2594,The effects of border control and quarantine measures on global spread of COVID-19,"The rapid expansion of coronavirus (COVID-19) has been observed in many parts of the world. Many newly reported cases of this new coronavirus during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases). For those cases without travel history, the risk of wider spreads through community contact is even higher. However, most population models assume a homogeneous infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases can pose a different risk to community spread.

We have developed an """"easy-to-use"""" mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported, secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered. Using the dynamics of the secondary cases, we are able to determine the probability of community spread.

Using the top 10 visiting cities from Wuhan in China as an example, we first demonstrated that the arrival time and the dynamics of the outbreaks at these cities can be successfully predicted under the reproductive number R0 = 2.92 and latent period{tau} = 5.2 days. Next, we showed that although control measures can gain extra 32.5 and 44.0 days in arrival time through a high intensive border control measure and a shorter time to quarantine under a low R0 (1.4), if the R0 is higher (2.92), only 10 extra days can be gained for each of the same measures. This suggests the importance of lowering the incidence at source regions together with infectious disease control measures in susceptible regions. The study allows us to assess the effects of border control and quarantine measures on the emergence and the global spread in a fully connected world using the dynamics of the secondary cases.","Hossain, M.

As the world is reopening, the risks of new flare-ups are rising. We report a data-driven approach, grounded in strong correlation between mobility and growth in COVID-19 cases two weeks later, to establish a spatial-temporal model of """"critical mobility"""" maps that separate relatively safe mobility levels from dangerous ones. The normalized difference between the current and critical mobility has predictive power for case trajectories during the """"opening-up"""" phases. For instance, actual mobility has risen above critical mobility in many southern US counties by the end of May, foreshadowing the latest virus resurgence. Encouragingly, critical mobility has been rising throughout the USA, likely due to face mask-wearing and social distancing measures. However, critical mobility is still well below pre-COVID mobility levels in most of the country suggesting continued mobility-reduction is still necessary.","Freitag, M.

ACE2 is a major cellular-entry receptor for the COVID-19 virus. Although ACE2 is known to be expressed in many organs, whether it is expressed by the conjunctival tissue is largely unknown. Human conjunctival tissues from 68 subjects were obtained, which included 10 subjects with conjunctival nevi, 20 subjects with conjunctivitis, 9 subjects with conjunctival papilloma, 16 subjects with conjunctival cyst, 7 subjects with conjunctival polyps, and 6 ocular traumas as normal subjects. Expression of ACE2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and western blot assay. We observed the expression of ACE2 by conjunctival tissues, expecially in conjunctival epithelial cells. ACE2 was significantly (p<0.001) overexpressed in conjunctival cells obtained from subjects with conjunctivitis, conjunctival nevi, conjunctival papilloma, conjunctival cyst, and conjunctival polyps epithelial cells when compared to that in conjunctival epithelial cells obtained from control subjects.

Pediatric surgery is not an exception. Prioritization protocols allowing us to provide emergency surgical care to the children in need while controlling the pandemic spread. The aim of this study is to share our experiences with the outcome of children with COVID-19 who had a co-existing surgical emergency.

MethodsThis is a retrospective observational study. We reviewed the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data of all patients admitted in our surgery department through the emergency department and later diagnosed to have COVID-19 by RT-PCR. The study duration was 3 months (April 2020 - June 2020). A nasopharyngeal swab was taken from all patients irrespective of symptoms to detect SARS CoV 2 by RT-PCR with the purpose of detecting asymptomatic patients and patients with atypical symptoms. Emergency surgical services were provided immediately without delay and patients with positive test results were isolated according to the hospital protocol. We divided the test positive patients into 4 age groups for the convenience of data analysis. Data were retrieved from hospital records and analyzed using SPSS (version 25) software. Ethical permission was taken from the hospital ethical review board.

ResultsTotal patients were 32. Seven (21.9%) of them were neonates. Twenty-four (75%) patients were male. The predominant diagnosis was acute abdomen followed by infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), myelomeningocele, and intussusception. Only two patients had mild respiratory symptoms (dry cough). Fever was present in 13 (40.6%) patients. Fourteen (43.8%) patients required surgical treatment. The mean duration of hospital stay was 5.5 days. One neonate with ARM died in the post-operative ward due to cardiac arrest. No patient had hypoxemia or organ failure. Seven health care workers (5.51%) including doctors & nurses got infected with SARS Co V2 during this period.

ConclusionOur study has revealed a milder course of COVID-19 in children with minimal infectivity even when present in association with emergency surgical conditions. This might encourage a gradual restart to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on childrens surgery.","Hasan, M. S.; Ali, M.

22033,UK and other SARS-CoV-2-Covariants - Simulation Modeling 70% Increase,"CovidSIMVL, an agent-based contagion-based viral transmission simulation tool, was employed to simulate the effects of viral agents of differing levels of infectivity. The constructs """"Velocity"""" and """"Increase in Velocity"""" were operationalized in terms of rates of transmission events over successive iterations (generations) in a set of CovidSIMVL trials. Treating 40-70% increase in velocity as a target, based on reports in the literature for the UK variant (VUI 202012/01), the series of trials reported in the paper demonstrate the calibration of CovidSIMVL parameters to produce increases in transmission rates of 40-70% above a baseline value. A series of follow-up studies is proposed to evaluate three different possible explanations for reported increases in SARS-Cov2-2 infections that are being attributed to spread of the UK and other variants: (a) simulations where the inherent characteristics of the virus (infectivity) are varied (genomic studies); (b) simulations where the behaviour of agents is varied (e.g., movement within and between spaces) while inherent characteristics of the virus are held constant (behavioural studies); and (c) simulations where both inherent properties of the virus and the behaviour of agents are varying to """"tease out"""" the interaction between biologically-based contributions to increased case counts, and contextual/behavioural contributions (epigenetic studies).","Chang, E.; Moselle, K.

10139,Racial and ethnic determinants of Covid-19 risk,"BackgroundRacial and ethnic minorities have disproportionately high hospitalization rates and mortality related to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). There are comparatively scant data on race and ethnicity as determinants of infection risk.

MethodsWe used a smartphone application (beginning March 24, 2020 in the United Kingdom [U.K.] and March 29, 2020 in the United States [U.S.]) to recruit 2,414,601 participants who reported their race/ethnicity through May 25, 2020 and employed logistic regression to determine the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for a positive Covid-19 test among racial and ethnic groups.

ResultsWe documented 8,858 self-reported cases of Covid-19 among 2,259,841 non-Hispanic white; 79 among 9,615 Hispanic; 186 among 18,176 Black; 598 among 63,316 Asian; and 347 among 63,653 other racial minority participants. Compared with non-Hispanic white participants, the risk for a positive Covid-19 test was increased across racial minorities (aORs ranging from 1.24 to 3.51). After adjustment for socioeconomic indices and Covid-19 exposure risk factors, the associations (aOR [95% CI]) were attenuated but remained significant for Hispanic (1.58 [1.24-2.02]) and Black participants (2.56 [1.93-3.39]) in the U.S. and South Asian (1.52 [1.38-1.67]) and Middle Eastern participants (1.56 [1.25-1.95]) in the U.K. A higher risk of Covid-19 and seeking or receiving treatment was also observed for several racial/ethnic minority subgroups.

ConclusionsOur results demonstrate an increase in Covid-19 risk among racial and ethnic minorities not completely explained by other risk factors for Covid-19, comorbidities, and sociodemographic characteristics.

We distinguished between high-risk and low-risk members of the population, and modeled differences in social interactions due to context, risk level, infection status, and testing status. The model incorporates many of the currently important characteristics of the disease, including overcapacity in the healthcare system and uncertainties surrounding the proportion and transmission potential of asymptomatic cases. We compared current policy guidelines from public health agencies with alternative options, and investigated the effects of policy decisions on the overall proportion of COVID-19-related deaths. Our results support current policies to contain the outbreak but also suggest possible refinements, including emphasizing the need to reduce public, random contacts more than private contacts, and testing low-risk symptomatic individuals before high-risk symptomatic individuals. Our model furthermore points to interactions among the three policy domains; the efficacy of a particular policy choice depends on other implemented policies. Finally, our results provide an explanation for why societies like Germany, with lower average rates of social contact, are more successful at containing the outbreak than highly social societies such as Italy, despite the implementation of similar policy measures.","Mccombs, A.; Kadelka, C.",2020-04-23,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.20.20073213,1,Claus Kadelka,Iowa State University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.20073213v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.20073213v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008388
16399,When lockdown policies amplify social inequalities in COVID-19 infections. Evidence from a cross-sectional population-based survey in France.,"ObjectivesTo assess social inequalities in the trends in COVID-19 infections following lockdown

DesignA cross-sectional survey conducted among the general population in France in April 2020, during COVID-19 lockdown.

Participants10 401 participants aged 18-64, from a national cohort who lived in the three metropolitan French regions most affected by the first wave of COVID-19.

Main outcomeThe main outcome was occurrence of possible COVID-19 symptoms, defined as the occurrence of sudden onset of cough, fever, dyspnea, ageusia and/or anosmia, that lasted more than three days in the 15 days before the survey. We used multinomial regression models to identify social and health factors related to possible COVID-19 before and during the lockdown.

ResultsIn all, 1,304 (13.0%; 95% CI: 12.0%-14.0%) reported cases of possible COVID-19. The effect of lockdown on the occurrence of possible COVID-19 was different across social hierarchies. The most privileged class individuals saw a significant decline in possible COVID-19 infections between the period prior to lockdown and during the lockdown (from 8.8% to 4.3%, P=0.0001) while the decline was less pronounced among working class individuals (6.9% before lockdown and 5.5% during lockdown, P=0.03). This differential effect of lockdown remained significant after adjusting for other factors including history of chronic disease. The odds of being contaminated during lockdown as opposed to the prior period increased by 57% among working class individuals (OR=1.57; 95% CI: 1.0-2.48). The same was true for those engaged in in-person professional activities during lockdown (OR=1.53; 95% CI: 1.03-2.29).

InterpretationLockdown was associated with social inequalities in the decline in COVID-19 infections, calling for the adoption of preventive policies to account for living and working conditions. Such adoptions are critical to reduce social inequalities related to COVID-19, as working-class individuals also have the highest COVID-19 related mortality, due to higher prevalence of comorbidities.

Section 1: What is already known on this topicSignificant differences in COVID-19 incidence by gender, class and race/ethnicity are recorded in many countries in the world. Lockdown measures implemented throughout the globe have been effective in reducing transmission risks.

Such results underline the need to design COVID-19 preventive policies that take into account living and working conditions, as working-class individuals also have the highest COVID-19 related mortality, due to higher prevalence of comorbidities.","Bajos, N.",2020-10-11,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.10.07.20208595,1,Nathalie Bajos,INSERM,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208595v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208595v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1186/s12889-021-10521-5
14963,Socio-demographic correlate of knowledge and practice toward novel coronavirus among people living in Mosul-Iraq: A cross-sectional study,"Background: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a worldwide pandemic, as the Iraqi authorities have started responding and taking action to control the spread of the pandemic. The knowledge and practices of the public play an important role in curbing the spreading of the virus by following the health guidelines. This study aimed to assess the socio-demographic correlate of knowledge and practices of Iraqi living in Mosul-Iraq towards novel coronavirus during its rapid rise. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of 909 participants was conducted among Mosul-Iraq between 20th June to 1st July 2020. The survey included three parts: 1) socio-demographic characteristics, 2) participants' knowledge, 3) participants' practices. T-test, ANOVA, chi-square, and binary logistic regression were used. A p-value less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) was considered statistically significant. Results: The results showed knowledge and practice mean score of (12.91\1.67) and (21.56\2.92) with cumulative knowledge and practice of 86% and 76% respectively towards 2019-nCoV. Socio-demographic characteristics such as age, marital status, gender, level of education and employment were statistically related with a higher mean score of knowledge and practice towards the virus as P<0.05. Conclusions: We concluded that the majority of the respondents demonstrate a high level of knowledge and practices towards 2019-nCoV except respondents with socio-demographic characteristics such as those who were younger, male respondents, those with lower education and those unemployed as such campaigns that will increase the knowledge and encourage adequate preventive practice towards 2019-nCoV should be targeted towards this group.","Qubais, B.; Al-Shahrabi, R.

11210,Predicting Health Disparities in Regions at Risk of Severe Illness to inform Healthcare Resource Allocations during Pandemics,"Pandemics including COVID-19 have disproportionately affected socioeconomically vulnerable populations. To create a repeatable modelling process to identify regional population centers with pandemic vulnerability, readily available COVID-19 and socioeconomic variable datasets were compiled, and linear regression models were built during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The models were validated later in the pandemic timeline using actual COVID-19 mortality rates in states with high population densities, with New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Michigan and Pennsylvania showing the strongest predictive results. Our models have been shared with the Department of Health Commissioners of each of these states as input into a much needed """"pandemic playbook"""" for local healthcare agencies in allocating medical testing and treatment resources.","Fusillo, T.; Fusillo, T.",2020-07-08,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.07.06.20147181,1,Tara Fusillo,John F.

16095,Comparing biomarkers for COVID-19 disease with commonly associated preexisting conditions and complications.,"Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with certain preexisting health conditions and can cause respiratory failure along with other multi-organ injuries. However, the mechanism of these relationships is unclear, and prognostic biomarkers for the disease and its systemic complications are lacking. This study aims to examine the plasma protein profile of COVID-19 patients and evaluate overlapping protein modules with biomarkers of common comorbidities.

Blood samples were collected from COVID-19 cases (n=307) and negative controls (n=78) among patients with acute respiratory distress. Proteins were measured by proximity extension assay utilizing next-generation sequencing technology. Its associations to COVID-19 disease characteristics were compared to that of preexisting conditions and established biomarkers for myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and chronic kidney disease.

Several proteins were differentially expressed in COVID-19, including multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-{gamma}, CXCL10, and CCL7/MCP-3. Elevated IL-6 was associated with increased severity, while baseline IL1RL1/ST2 levels were associated with a worse prognosis. Network analysis identified several protein modules associated with COVID-19 disease characteristics overlapping with processes of preexisting hypertension and impaired kidney function. BNP and NTpro-BNP, markers for MI and stroke, increased with disease progression and were positively associated with severity. MMP12 was similarly elevated and has been previously linked to smoking and inflammation in emphysema, along with increased cardiovascular disease risk.

In conclusion, this study provides an overview of the systemic effects of COVID-19 and candidate biomarkers for clinical assessment of disease progression and the risk of systemic complications.","Huang, J.",2020-10-05,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.02.20205609,1,Jesse Huang,Karolinska Insitutet,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.02.20205609v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.02.20205609v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
20422,"Stages of COVID-19 pandemic and paths to herd immunity by vaccination: dynamical model comparing Austria, Luxembourg and Sweden","BackgroundWorldwide more than 72 million people have been infected and 1.6 million died with SARS-CoV-2 by 15th December 2020. Non-pharmaceutical interventions which decrease social interaction have been implemented to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to mitigate stress on healthcare systems and prevent deaths. The pandemic has been tackled with disparate strategies by distinct countries resulting in different epidemic dynamics. However, with vaccines now becoming available, the current urgent open question is how the interplay between vaccination strategies and social interaction will shape the pandemic in the next months.

MethodsTo address this question, we developed an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model including social interaction, undetected cases and the progression of patients trough hospitals, intensive care units (ICUs) and death. We calibrated our model to data of Luxem-bourg, Austria and Sweden, until 15th December 2020. We incorporated the effect of vaccination to investigate under which conditions herd immunity would be achievable in 2021.

ResultsThe model reveals that Sweden has the highest fraction of undetected cases, Luxembourg displays the highest fraction of infected population, and all three countries are far from herd immunity as of December 2020. The model quantifies the level of social interactions, and allows to assess the level which would keep Reff (t) below 1. In December 2020, this level is around 1/3 of what it was before the pandemic for all the three countries. The model allows to estimate the vaccination rate needed for herd immunity and shows that 2700 vaccinations/day are needed in Luxembourg to reach it by mid of April and 45,000 for Austria and Sweden. The model estimates that vaccinating the whole countrys population within 1 year could lead to herd immunity by July in Luxembourg and by August in Austria and Sweden.

ConclusionThe model allows to shed light on the dynamics of the epidemics in different waves and countries. Our results emphasize that vaccination will help considerably but not immediately and therefore social measures will remain important for several months before they can be fully alleviated.","Kemp, F.; Proverbio, D.; Aalto, A.; Mombaerts, L.; Fouquier D Herouel, A.; Husch, A.; Ley, C.; Goncalves, J.; Skupin, A.; Magni, S.",2021-01-04,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.12.31.20249088,1,Stefano Magni,"Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine, University of Luxembourg",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.31.20249088v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.31.20249088v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
5171,Risk assessment of drug-induced Long QT Syndrome for some COVID-19 repurposed drugs,"The risk-benefit ratio associated with the use of repurposed drugs to treat 2019 SARS-CoV-2 related infectious disease (COVID-19) is complicated since benefits are awaited, not proven. A thorough literature search was conducted to source information on the pharmacological properties of 5 drugs and 1 combination (azithromycin, chloroquine, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and lopinavir/ritonavir) repurposed to treat COVID-19. A risk assessment of drug-induced Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) associated with COVID-19 repurposed drugs was performed and compared to 23 well-known torsadogenic and 10 low torsadogenic risk compounds. Computer calculations were performed using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, including affinity to block the rapid component of the delayed rectifier cardiac potassium current (IKr) encoded by the human ether-a-go-go gene (hERG), propensity to prolong cardiac repolarization (QT interval) and cause torsade de pointes (TdP). Seven different LQTS indices were calculated and compared. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database was queried with specific key words relating to arrhythmogenic events. Estimators of LQTS risk levels indicated a very high or moderate risk for all COVID-19 repurposed drugs with the exception for azithromycin, although cases of TdP have been reported with this drug. There was excellent agreement among the various indices used to assess risk of drug-induced LQTS for the 6 repurposed medications and 23 torsadogenic compounds. Based on our results, monitoring of the QT interval shall be performed when some COVID-19 repurposed drugs are used, as such monitoring is possible for hospitalized patients or with the use of biodevices for outpatients.","Michaud, V.; Dow, P.; Al Rihani, S.

13917,Examining the status of improved air quality due to COVID-19 lockdown and an associated reduction in anthropogenic emissions,"Clean air is a fundamental necessity for human health and well-being. The COVID-19 lockdown worldwide resulted in controls on anthropogenic emission that have a significant synergistic effect on air quality ecosystem services (ESs). This study utilised both satellite and surface monitored measurements to estimate air pollution for 20 cities across the world. Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) data were used for evaluating tropospheric air quality status during the lockdown period. Surface measurement data were retrieved from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, USA) for a more explicit assessment of air quality ESs. Google Earth Engine TROPOMI application was utilised for a time series assessment of air pollution during the lockdown (1 Feb to 11 May 2020) compared with the lockdown equivalent periods (1 Feb to 11 May 2019). The economic valuation for air pollution reduction services was measured using two approaches: (1) median externality value coefficient approach; and (2) public health burden approach. Human mobility data from Apple (for city-scale) and Google (for country scale) was used for examining the connection between human interferences on air quality ESs. Using satellite data, the spatial and temporal concentration of four major pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and the aerosol index (AI) were measured. For NO2, the highest reduction was found in Paris (46%), followed by Detroit (40%), Milan (37%), Turin (37%), Frankfurt (36%), Philadelphia (34%), London (34%), and Madrid (34%), respectively. At the same time, a comparably lower reduction of NO2 is observed in Los Angeles (11%), Sao Paulo (17%), Antwerp (24%), Tehran (25%), and Rotterdam (27%), during the lockdown period. Using the adjusted value coefficients, the economic value of the air quality ESs was calculated for different pollutants. Using the public health burden valuation method, the highest economic benefits due to the reduced anthropogenic emission (for NO2) was estimated in US$ for New York (501M $), followed by London (375M $), Chicago (137M $), Paris (124M $), Madrid (90M $), Philadelphia (89M $), Milan (78M $), Cologne (67M $), Los Angeles (67M $), Frankfurt (52M $), Turin (45M $), Detroit (43M $), Barcelona (41M $), Sao Paulo (40M $), Tehran (37M $), Denver (30M $), Antwerp (16M $), Utrecht (14 million $), Brussels (9 million $), Rotterdam (9 million $), respectively. In this study, the public health burden and median externality valuation approaches were adopted for the economic valuation and subsequent interpretation. This one dimension and linear valuation may not be able to track the overall economic impact of air pollution on human welfare. Therefore, research that broadens the scope of valuation in environmental capitals needs to be initiated for exploring the importance of proper monetary valuation in natural capital accounting.","Sannigrahi, S.; Molter, A.; Kumar, P.; Zhang, Q.; Basu, B.; Basu, A.

4604,"A systematic review of antibody mediated immunity to coronaviruses: antibody kinetics, correlates of protection, and association of antibody responses with severity of disease","The duration and nature of immunity generated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Many public health responses and modeled scenarios for COVID-19 outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV-2 assume that infection results in an immune response that protects individuals from future infections or illness for some amount of time. The timescale of protection is a critical determinant of the future impact of the pathogen. The presence or absence of protective immunity due to infection or vaccination (when available) will affect future transmission and illness severity. The dynamics of immunity and nature of protection are relevant to discussions surrounding therapeutic use of convalescent sera as well as efforts to identify individuals with protective immunity. Here, we review the scientific literature on antibody immunity to coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 as well as the related SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and human endemic coronaviruses (HCoVs). We reviewed 1281 abstracts and identified 322 manuscripts relevant to 5 areas of focus: 1) antibody kinetics, 2) correlates of protection, 3) immunopathogenesis, 4) antigenic diversity and cross-reactivity, and 5) population seroprevalence. While studies of SARS-CoV-2 are necessary to determine immune responses to it, evidence from other coronaviruses can provide clues and guide future research.

7844,Clinical and molecular characterization of COVID-19 hospitalized patients,"Clinical and molecular characterization by Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) is reported in 35 COVID-19 patients attending the University Hospital in Siena, Italy, from April 7 to May 7, 2020. Eighty percent of patients required respiratory assistance, half of them being on mechanical ventilation. Fiftyone percent had hepatic involvement and hyposmia was ascertained in 3 patients. Searching for common genes by collapsing methods against 150 WES of controls of the Italian population failed to give straightforward statistically significant results with the exception of two genes. This result is not unexpected since we are facing the most challenging common disorder triggered by environmental factors with a strong underlying heritability (50%). The lesson learned from Autism-Spectrum-Disorders prompted us to re-analyse the cohort treating each patient as an independent case, following a Mendelian-like model. We identified for each patient an average of 2.5 pathogenic mutations involved in virus infection susceptibility and pinpointing to one or more rare disorder(s). To our knowledge, this is the first report on WES and COVID-19. Our results suggest a combined model for COVID-19 susceptibility with a number of common susceptibility genes which represent the favorite background in which additional host private mutations may determine disease progression.","Benetti, E.; Giliberti, A.; Emiliozzi, A.; Velentino, F.; Bergantini, L.; Fallerini, C.; Anedda, F.; Amitrano, S.; Conticini, E.; Tita, R.; Dalessandro, M.; Fava, F.; Marcantonio, S.; Baldassarri, M.; Bruttini, M.; Mazzei, M.

10573,Predicting the Trajectory of Any COVID19 Epidemic From the Best Straight Line,"A pipeline involving data acquisition, curation, carefully chosen graphs and mathematical models, allows analysis of COVID-19 outbreaks at 3,546 locations world-wide (all countries plus smaller administrative divisions with data available). Comparison of locations with over 50 deaths shows all outbreaks have a common feature: H(t) defined as loge(X(t)/X(t-1)) decreases linearly on a log scale, where X(t) is the total number of Cases or Deaths on day, t (we use ln for loge). The downward slopes vary by about a factor of three with time constants (1/slope) of between 1 and 3 weeks; this suggests it may be possible to predict when an outbreak will end. Is it possible to go beyond this and perform early prediction of the outcome in terms of the eventual plateau number of total confirmed cases or deaths?

We test this hypothesis by showing that the trajectory of cases or deaths in any outbreak can be converted into a straight line. Specifically Y(t) {equiv} -ln(ln(N / X (t)), is a straight line for the correct plateau value N, which is determined by a new method, Best-Line Fitting (BLF). BLF involves a straight-line facilitation extrapolation needed for prediction; it is blindingly fast and amenable to optimization. We find that in some locations that entire trajectory can be predicted early, whereas others take longer to follow this simple functional form. Fortunately, BLF distinguishes predictions that are likely to be correct in that they show a stable plateau of total cases or death (N value). We apply BLF to locations that seem close to a stable predicted N value and then forecast the outcome at some locations that are still growing wildly. Our accompanying web-site will be updated frequently and provide all graphs and data described here.","Levitt, M.; Scaiewicz, A.; Zonta, F.",2020-06-30,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.26.20140814,2,Michael Levitt,Stanford School of Medicine,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.20140814v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.20140814v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
3850,"Injection Molded Autoclavable, Scalable, Conformable (iMASC) system for aerosol-based protection","There is a dire need for personal protective equipment (PPE) within healthcare settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, single use disposable N95 face masks have been limited in supply. We have developed an Injection Molded Autoclavable, Scalable, Conformable (iMASC) system for aerosol-based protection. The iMASC system was designed as a reusable liquid silicone rubber mask with disposable N95 filter cartridges that can fit most face sizes and shapes. This system reduced the amount of N95 filter while preserving breathability and fit. Using finite element analysis, we demonstrated mask deformation and reaction forces from facial scans of twenty different wearers. In addition, we validated these findings by successful fit testing in twenty participants in a prospective clinical trial. The iMASC system has the potential to protect our healthcare workers with a reusable N95-comparable face mask that is rapidly scalable.","Traverso, C.; Byrne, J.

Although the majority of infections are mild, severe and critical COVID-19 patients face deterioration of respiratory function, and may also present extrapulmonary manifestations, mostly affecting the kidney, digestive tract, heart and nervous system. Here, we prospectively evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material by RT-PCR in urine samples obtained from critical care COVID-19 patients. In 51 patients included, we found higher serum creatinine levels, a longer hospital stay and a more frequent dialysis need in urine-positive patients. These findings could suggest that, in predisposed patients, a direct viral cytopathic effect may contribute to a more severe disease phenotype.","De Souza, S. P.; Silveira, M. A. D.; Souza, B. S. D.

8992,Systems-level immunomonitoring from acute to recovery phase of severe COVID-19,"The immune response to SARS-CoV2 is under intense investigation, but not fully understood att this moment. Severe disease is characterized by vigorous inflammatory responses in the lung, often with a sudden onset after 5-7 days of stable disease. Efforts to modulate this hyperinflammation and the associated acute respiratory distress syndrome, rely on the unraveling of the immune cell interactions and cytokines that drive such responses. Systems-level analyses are required to simultaneously capture all immune cell populations and the many protein mediators by which cells communicate. Since every patient analyzed will be captured at different stages of his or her infection, longitudinal monitoring of the immune response is critical. Here we report on a systems-level blood immunomonitoring study of 39 adult patients, hospitalized with severe COVID-19 and followed with up to 14 blood samples from acute to recovery phases of the disease. We describe an IFN{gamma} - Eosinophil axis activated prior to lung hyperinflammation and changes in cell-cell coregulation during different stages of the disease. We also map an immune trajectory during recovery that is shared among patients with severe COVID-19.

20396,Tele-Rehabilitation for People with Visual Disabilities During COVID-19 Pandemic: Lesson Learned,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 outbreak poses a global crisis in health care delivery system, including habilitation and rehabilitation services. In the present study, we shared our experiences on telerehabilitation services established primarily for students with visual disabilities (SwVD) amidst COVID-19 pandemic and its outputs.

MethodsFollowing the lockdown declared on March 23, 2020, the rehabilitative team of a tertiary eye center in north India received information that many VCS were stranded in schools for the blind in Delhi, and feeling with anxiety and panic in absence of teachers. Shortly, the room for vision rehabilitation clinic was set-up for tele-facilities. The intended services was explained while disseminating the mobile numbers. A semi-structured questionnaire consisting of closed and open-ended was developed to record COVID-19 knowledge and concerns. Inductive content analysis was used to report the qualitative information.

ResultsAs of June 30, 2020, a total of 492 clients contacted the team, with maximum from Delhi (41.5%), and predominantly males (78.8%). Around 80.3% of callers were VCS with age range of 11 to 30 years. The two most frequently encountered health needs were itching in eyes (36.1%) and headache (29%). Television news was the most used medium among callers to get COVID-19 information. Cough is a less frequently known mode of transmission (28%), similarly handwashing as a less known for prevention (17.2%). Eight concerns were recorded based on qualitative data analysis.

ConclusionTele-rehabilitation provides valuable insights and has the potential to address various concerns, uncertainty, anxiety, and fear among SVD during the pandemic.","Senjam, S.

18222,Assessment of the Impacts of Pharmaceutical and Non-pharmaceutical Intervention on COVID-19 in South Africa Using Mathematical Model,"The novel coronal virus has spread across more than 213 countries within the space of six months causing devastating public health hazard and monumental economic loss. In the absence of clinically approved pharmaceutical intervention, attentions are shifted to non-pharmaceutical controls to mitigate the burden of the novel pandemic. In this regard, a ten mutually exclusive compartmental mathematical model is developed to investigate possible effects of both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical controls incorporating both private and governments quarantine and treatments. Several reproduction numbers were calculated and used to determine the impact of both control measures as well as projected benefits of social distancing, treatments and vaccination. We investigate and compare the possible impact of social distancing incorporating different levels of vaccination, with vaccination programme incorporating different levels of treatment. Using the officially published South African COVID-19 data, the numerical simulation shows that the community reproduction threshold will be 30 when there is no social distancing but will drastically reduced to 5 (about 83% reduction) when social distancing is enforced. Furthermore, when there is vaccination with perfect efficacy, the community reproduction threshold will be 4 which increases to 12 (about 67% increment) with-out vaccination. We also established that the implementation of both interventions is enough to curtail the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa which is in confirmation with the recommendation of the world health organization.","Musa, R.; Ezugwu, A.

13340,Trends in Covid-19 risk-adjusted mortality rates in a single health system,"Early reports showed high mortality from Covid-19; by contrast, the current outbreaks in the southern and western United States are associated with fewer deaths, raising hope that treatments have improved. However, in Texas for instance, 63% of diagnosed cases are currently under 50, compared to only 52% nationally in March-April. Current demographics in Arizona and Florida are similar. Therefore, whether decreasing Covid-19 mortality rates are a reflection of changing demographics or represent improvements in clinical care is unknown. We assessed outcomes over time in a single health system, accounting for changes in demographics and clinical factors.

Methods

We analyzed biweekly mortality rates for admissions between March 1 and June 20, 2020 in a single health system in New York City. Outcomes were obtained as of July 14, 2020. We included all hospitalizations with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 disease. Patients with multiple hospitalizations (N=157, 3.3%) were included repeatedly if they continued to have laboratory-confirmed disease. Mortality was defined as in-hospital death or discharge to hospice care. Based on prior literature, we constructed a multivariable logistic regression model to generate expected risk of death, adjusting for age; sex; self-reported race and ethnicity; body mass index; smoking history; presence of hypertension, heart failure, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic kidney disease, or pulmonary disease individually as dummy variables; and admission oxygen saturation, D-dimer, C reactive protein, ferritin, and cycle threshold for RNA detection. All data were obtained from the electronic health record. We then calculated the sum of observed and expected deaths in each two-week period and multiplied each period's observed/expected (O/E) risk by the overall average crude mortality to generate biweekly adjusted rates. We calculated Poisson control limits and indicated points outside the control limits as significantly different, following statistical process control standards. The NYU institutional review board approved the study and granted a waiver of consent.

Results

We included 4,689 hospitalizations, of which 4,661 (99.4%) had died or been discharged. The median age, and the proportion male or with any comorbidity decreased over time; median real-time PCR cycle threshold increased (indicating relatively less concentration of virus) (Table). For instance, median age decreased from 67 years in the first two weeks to 49 in the last two. Peak hospitalizations were during the fifth and sixth study weeks, which accounted for 40% of the hospitalizations. Median length of stay for patients who died or were discharged to hospice was 8 days (interquartile range, 4-16).

Unadjusted mortality dropped each period, from 30.2% in the first two weeks to 3% in the last two weeks, with the last eight weeks being lower than the 95% control limits. Risk adjustment partially attenuated the mortality decline, but adjusted mortality rates in the second-to-last two weeks remained outside the control limits (Figure, Table). The O/E risk of mortality decreased from 1.07 (0.64-1.67) in the first two weeks to 0.39 (0.08-1.12) in the last two weeks.

Discussion

In this 16-week study of Covid-19 mortality at a single health system, we found that changes in demographics and severity of illness at presentation account for some, but not all, of the decrease in unadjusted mortality. Even after risk adjustment for a variety of clinical and demographic factors, mortality was significantly lower towards the end of the study period.

Incremental improvements in outcomes are likely a combination of increasing clinical experience, decreasing hospital volume, growing use of new pharmacologic treatments (such as corticosteroids, remdesivir and anti-cytokine treatments), non-pharmacologic treatments (such as proning), earlier intervention, community awareness, and lower viral load exposure from increasing mask wearing and social distancing. It is also possible that earlier periods had a more virulent circulating strain.

In summary, data from one health system suggest that Covid-19 remains a serious disease for high risk patients, but that outcomes may be improving.","Horwitz, L.; Jones, S. A.; Cerfolio, R.

24871,Emergence of multiple SARS-CoV-2 antibody escape variants in an immunocompromised host undergoing convalescent plasma treatment,"SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concerns (VOC), e.g., B.1.351 (20H/501Y.V2) and P1 (20J/501Y.V3), harboring N-terminal domain (NTD) or the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (e.g., E484K) mutations, exhibit reduced in vitro susceptibility to convalescent serum, commercial antibody cocktails, and vaccine neutralization, and have been associated with reinfection. The accumulation of these mutations could be the consequence of intra-host viral evolution due to prolonged infection in immunocompromised hosts. In this study, we document the microevolution of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from sequential tracheal aspirates from an immunosuppressed patient on tacrolimus, steroids and convalescent plasma therapy, and identify the emergence of multiple NTD and RBD mutations associated with reduced antibody neutralization as early as three weeks after infection. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the first swab (Day 0) and three tracheal aspirates (Day 7, 21 and 27) were compared at the sequence level. We identified five different S protein mutations at the NTD or RBD regions from the second tracheal aspirate sample (21 Day). The S:Q493R substitution and S:243-244LA deletion had [~]70% frequency, while ORF1a:A138T, S:141-144LGVY deletion, S:E484K and S:Q493K substitutions demonstrated [~]30%, [~]30%, [~]20% and [~]10% mutation frequency, respectively. However, the third tracheal aspirate sample collected one week later (Day 27) was predominated by the haplotype of ORF1a:A138T, S:141-144LGVY deletion and S:E484K (> 95% mutation frequency). Notably, S protein deletions (141-144LGVY and 243-244LA deletions in NTD region) and substitutions (Q493K/R and E484K in the RBD region) previously showed reduced susceptibly to monoclonal antibody or convalescent plasma. The observation supports the hypothesis that VOCs can independently arise and that immunocompromised patients on convalescent plasma therapy are potential breeding grounds for immune-escape mutants.

2085,Case fatality rate of novel coronavirus disease 2019 in China,"BackgroundA pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which have caused more than 80 thousand persons infected globally is still ongoing. This study aims to calculate its case fatality rate (CFR).

MethodsThe method, termed as converged CFR calculation, was based on the formula of dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases T days before, where T was an average time period from case confirmation to death. It was found that supposing a T, if it was smaller (bigger) than the true T, calculated CFRs would gradually increase (decrease) to infinitely near the true T with time went on. According to the law, the true T value could be determined by trends of daily CFRs calculated with different assumed T values (left of true T is decreasing, right is increasing). Then the CFR could be calculated.

ResultsCFR of COVID-19 in China except Hubei Province was 0.8% to 0.9%. So far, the CFR had accurately predicted the death numbers more than 3 weeks. CFR in Hubei of China was 5.4% by which the calculated death number corresponded with the reported number for 2 weeks.

ConclusionThe method could be used for CFR calculating while pandemics are still ongoing. Dynamic monitoring of the daily CFRs trends could help outbreak-controller to have a clear vision in the timeliness of the case confirmation.","Qi, R.; Ye, C.; Qin, X.-R.; Yu, X.-J.",2020-03-03,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.02.26.20028076,2,Xue-Jie Yu,"Wuhan University School of Health Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028076v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028076v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
15424,Diagnosis value of SARS-CoV-2 antigen/antibody combined testing using rapid diagnostic tests at hospital admission,"ObjectivesThe implementation of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) may enhance the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 testing, as RDTs are widely accessible and easy to use. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a diagnosis strategy based on a combination of antigen and IgM/IgG serological RDTs.

MethodsPlasma and nasopharyngeal samples were collected between 14 March and 11 April 2020 at hospital admission from 45 patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 and 20 negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 antigen (Ag) was assessed in nasopharyngeal swabs using the Coris Respi-Strip. For IgM/IgG detection, SureScreen Diagnostics and Szybio Biotech RDTs were used in addition to laboratory assays (Abbott Alinity i SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Theradiag COVID-19 IgM ELISA).

ResultsUsing the Ag RDT, 13 out of 45 (29.0%) specimens tested positive, the sensitivity was 87.0% for Cycle Threshold (CT) values [&le;] 25 and 0% for CT values > 25. IgG detection was associated with high CT values and the amount of time after the onset of symptoms. The profile of isolated IgM on RDTs was more frequently observed during the first and second week after the onset of symptoms. The combination of Ag and IgM/IgG RDTs enabled the detection of up to 84.0% of COVID-19 confirmed cases at hospital admission.

ConclusionAntigen and antibody-based RDTs showed suboptimal performances when used alone. However when used in combination, they are able to identify most COVID-19 patients admitted in an emergency department.","Veyrenche, N.; Bollore, K.; Pisoni, A.; Bedin, A.-S.; Mondain, A.-M.; Ducos, J.; Segondy, M.; Montes, B.; Pastor, P.; Morquin, D.; Makinson, A.; Le Moing, V.; Van De Perre, P.; Foulongne, V.; Tuaillon, E.",2020-09-28,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.09.19.20197855,2,Nicolas Veyrenche,Montpellier University Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.19.20197855v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.19.20197855v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1002/jmv.26855
18162,Predictors of adverse outcome in patients with suspected COVID-19 managed in a virtual hospital setting: a cohort study,"ObjectiveIdentify predictors of adverse outcome in a Virtual Hospital (VH) setting for COVID 19.

DesignReal-world prospective observational study.

SettingVirtual hospital remote assessment service in West Hertfordshire NHS Trust, UK.

ParticipantsPatients with suspected COVID-19 illness enrolled directly from the community (post-accident and emergency (A&E) or medical intake assessment) or post-inpatient admission.

Main outcome measureDeath or (re-)admission to inpatient hospital care over 28 days.

Results900 patients with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 (455 referred from A&E or medical intake and 445 post-inpatient) were included in the analysis. 76 (8.4%) of these experienced an adverse outcome (15 deaths in admitted patients, 3 deaths in patients not admitted, and 58 additional inpatient admissions). Predictors of adverse outcome were increase in age (OR 1.04 [95%CI: 1.02, 1.06] per year of age), history of cancer (OR 2.87 [95%CI: 1.41, 5.82]), history of mental health problems (OR 1.76 [95%CI: 1.02, 3.04]), severely impaired renal function (OR for eGFR <30 = 9.09 [95%CI: 2.01, 41.09]) and having a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result (OR 2.0 [95% CI: 1.11, 3.60]).

ConclusionsThese predictors may help direct intensity of monitoring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who are being remotely monitored by primary or secondary care services. Further research is needed to identify the reasons for increased risk of adverse outcome associated with cancer and mental health problems.

10838,A genome epidemiological study of SARS-CoV-2 introduction into Japan,"BackgroundAfter the first case of COVID-19 in Japan on 15 January 2020, multiple nationwide COVID-19 clusters were identified by the end of February. The Japanese government focused on mitigating emerging COVID-19 clusters by conducting active nationwide epidemiological surveillance. However, an increasing number of cases appeared until early April, many with unclear infection routes exhibiting no recent history of travel outside Japan. We aimed to evaluate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome sequences from COVID-19 cases until early April and characterise the genealogical networks to demonstrate possible routes of spread in Japan.

MethodsNasopharyngeal specimens were collected from patients and a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed. Positive RNA samples were subjected whole genome sequencing and a haplotype network analysis was performed.

FindingsSome of the primary clusters identified during January and February in Japan directly descended from Wuhan-Hu-1-related isolates in China and other distinct clusters. Clusters were almost contained until mid-March; the haplotype network analysis demonstrated that COVID-19 cases from late March through early April may have caused an additional large cluster related to the outbreak in Europe, leading to additional spread within Japan. National self-restraint during February was effective in mitigating the COVID-19 spread, but late action on stopping immigration and declaring national emergency in Japan might be involved in the later increase in cases.

InterpretationGenome surveillance suggested that at least two distinct SARS-CoV-2 introductions from China and other countries occurred.

24055,Head-to-head performance comparison of self-collected nasal versus professional-collected nasopharyngeal swab for a WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic test,"BackgroundIn 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended two SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow antigen detecting rapid diagnostics tests (Ag-RDTs), both initially with nasopharyngeal (NP) sample collection. Independent head-to-head studies demonstrated for SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs nasal sampling to be a comparable and reliable alternative for nasopharyngeal (NP) sampling.

MethodsWe conducted a head-to-head comparison study of a supervised, self-collected nasal mid-turbinate (NMT) swab and a professional-collected NP swab, using the Panbio Ag-RDT (the second WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT, distributed by Abbott). We calculated positive and negative percent agreement and, compared to the reference standard reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), sensitivity and specificity for both sampling techniques.

ResultsA SARS-CoV-2 infection could be diagnosed by RT-PCR in 45 of 290 participants (15.5%). Comparing the NMT and NP sampling the positive percent agreement of the Ag-RDT was 88.1% (37/42 PCR positives detected; CI 75.0% - 94.8%). The negative percent agreement was 98.8% (245/248; CI 96.5% - 99.6%). The overall sensitivity of Panbio with NMT sampling was 84.4% (38/45; CI 71.2% - 92.3%) and 88.9% (40/45; CI 76.5% - 95.5%) with NP sampling. Specificity was 99.2% (243/245; CI 97.1% - 99.8%) for both, NP and NMT sampling. The sensitivity of the Panbio test in participants with high viral load (> 7 log10 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/mL) was 96.3% (CI 81.7% - 99.8%) for both, NMT and NP sampling.

ConclusionFor the Panbio Ag-RDT supervised NMT self-sampling yields to results comparable to NP sampling.

Our data showed that the immune system and function gradually remodeled and declined with age, starting from age 16 until age 91 in 25,239 healthy controls. An analysis of the relationship between the number of lymphocytes and age revealed that the lymphocyte and subset counts tended to decline with age significantly. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific immunity declined with age and was associated with survival time in fatal cases. Loss in the expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity could be expanded in vitro. The concurrent decline in SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular and humoral immunities and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 exposure predicted fatal outcomes. Our findings provide a basis for further analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity and understanding of the pathogenesis of fatal COVID-19 cases.

20805,An open-access database of infectious disease transmission trees to explore superspreader epidemiology,"Historically, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases have caused large, deadly, and expensive multi-national outbreaks. Often outbreak investigations aim to identify who infected whom by reconstructing the outbreak transmission tree, which visualizes transmission between individuals as a network with nodes representing individuals and branches representing transmission from person to person. We compiled a database of 383 published, standardized transmission trees consisting of 16 directly-transmitted diseases ranging in size from 2 to 286 cases. For each tree and disease we calculated several key statistics, such as outbreak size, average number of secondary infections, the dispersion parameter, and the number of superspreaders. We demonstrated the potential utility of the database through short analyses addressing questions about superspreader epidemiology for a variety of diseases, including COVID-19. First, we compared the frequency and contribution of superspreaders to onward transmission across diseases. COVID-19 outbreaks had significantly fewer superspreaders than outbreaks of SARS and MERS and a dispersion parameter between that of SARS and MERS. Across diseases the presence of more superspreaders was associated with greater outbreak size. Second, we further examined how early spread impacts tree size. Generally, trees sparked by a superspreader had larger outbreak sizes than those trees not sparked by a superspreader, and this trend was significant for COVID-19 trees. Third, we investigated patterns in how superspreaders are infected. Across trees with more than one superspreader, we found support for the theory that superspreaders generate other superspreaders, even when controlling for number of secondary infections. In sum, our findings put the role of superspreading to COVID-19 transmission in perspective with that of SARS and MERS and suggest an avenue for further research on the generation of superspreaders. These data have been made openly available to encourage reuse and further scientific inquiry.

Author SummaryPublic health investigations often aim to identify who infected whom, or the transmission tree, during outbreaks of infectious diseases. These investigations tend to be resource intensive but valuable as they contain epidemiological information, including the average number of infections caused by each individual and the variation in this number. To date, there remains no standardized format nor comprehensive database of infectious disease transmission trees. To fill this gap, we standardized and compiled more than 350 published transmission trees for 16 directly-transmitted diseases into a database that is publicly available. In this paper, we give an overview of the database construction process, as well as a demonstration of the types of questions that the database can be used to answer related to superspreader epidemiology. For example, we show that COVID-19 outbreaks have fewer superspreaders than outbreaks of SARS and MERS. We also find support for the theory that superspreaders generate other superspreaders. In the future, this database can be used to answer other outstanding questions in the field of epidemiology.","Taube, J. C.; Miller, P. B.; Drake, J.

17571,"COVID-19, a social disease in Paris: a socio-economic wide association study on hospitalized patients highlights low-income neighbourhood as a key determinant of severe COVID-19 incidence during the first wave of the epidemic","BackgroundStudies have already shown that many environmental factors are associated with COVID-19 incidence. However, none have studied a very large set of socio-economic indicators and analysed to what extent these factors could highlight populations at high risk for COVID-19. We propose here a new approach, a socio-economic wide study, to pinpoint subgroups with a high incidence of COVID-19, and illustrated this approach using hospitalized cases in Paris area.

MethodsWe extracted 303 socio-economic indicators from French census data for the 855 residential units in Paris and assessed their association with COVID-19 hospitalization risk. We then fitted a predictive model using a penalized regression on these indicators to predict the incidence of patient hospitalization for COVID-19 in Paris.

FindingsThe most associated indicator was income, corresponding to the 3rd decile of the population (OR= 0.11, CI95% [0.05; 0.20]). A model including only income achieves a high performance in both the training set (AUC=0.78, CI95%: 0.72-0.85) and the test set (AUC=0.79 (CI95%: 0.71-0.87). Overall, the 45% most deprived areas gathered 86% of the areas with a high incidence of COVID-19 hospitalized cases.

InterpretationDuring the first wave of the epidemic, income predicted Paris areas at risk for a high incidence of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with a high performance. Socio-economic wide association studies, collecting passively data from hospitalized cases, therefore not necessitating any effort for health caregivers, is of particular interest in such a period of hospital overcrowding as it provides real-time indirect information on populations having high COVID-19 incidence.","Jannot, A.-S.; Countouris, H.; Burgun, A.; Katsahian, S.; Rance, B.",2020-11-03,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.10.30.20222901,1,Anne-Sophie Jannot,Universite de Paris,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.20222901v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.20222901v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
6722,Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine effectiveness in human subjects during coronavirus: a systematic review,"In a search to find effective treatments for COVID-19, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have gained attention. We aim to provide evidence to support clinical decision-making regarding medication for the treatment of COVID-19 by carrying out a systematic review of the literature. The electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, and HMIC were searched up to April 2020. Eligible study outcomes included: extubation or patient recovery. Relevant data were extracted and analysed by narrative synthesis. Our results included six studies in the review of which four studies were of good or fair quality. All eligible studies included were for coronavirus involving the use of either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to treat common symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue. Outcomes most commonly reported were improved lung function, viral clearance, and hospital discharge. Strong evidence to support the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 is lacking. Fast track trials are riddled with bias and may not conform to rigorous guidelines which may lead to inadequate data being reported. The use of these drugs in combination with other medications may be useful but without knowing which groups they are suited for and when they may cause more harm than good.","Rawaf, S.; Al-Saffar, M.; Quezada-Yamamoto, H.; Alshaikh, M.; Pelly, M.; Rawaf, D.; Dubois, E.; Majeed, A.",2020-05-11,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.05.07.20094326,1,Salman Rawaf,Imperial College London,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.07.20094326v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.07.20094326v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
3876,"The basic reproduction number and prediction of the epidemic size of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Shahroud, Iran","ObjectivesTo estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 in the early stage of the epidemic and predict the expected number of new cases in Shahroud, Northeast of Iran.

MethodsThe R0 of COVID-19 was estimated using the serial interval distribution and the number of incidence cases. The serial interval was fit with a gamma distribution. The probable incidence and cumulative incidence in the next 30 days were predicted using the assumption that daily incidence follows a Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. Data analysis was done using """"earlyR"""" and """"projections"""" packages in R software.

ResultsThe maximum-likelihood value of R0 was 2.7 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1 to 3.4) for the COVID-19 epidemic in the early 14 days and decreased to 1.13 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.25) by the end of the day 41. The expected average number of new cases in Shahroud is 9.0{+/-}3.8 case/day, which means an estimated total of 271 (95% CI: 178-383) new cases in the next 30 days.

ConclusionsIt is essential to reduce the R0 to values below one. Therefore, we strongly recommend enforcing and continuing the current preventive measures, restricting travel, and providing screening tests for a larger proportion of the population.","Khosravi, A.; Chaman, R.; Rohani-Rasaf, M.; Zare, F.; Mehravaran, S.; Emamian, M.

23685,Using Machine Learning along with Data Science algorithms to pre-process and forecast COVID-19 Cases and Deaths,"The Covid-19 pandemic has taken a major toll on the health and state of our global population. With tough decisions for allocating resources(i.e. vaccines)[1] are being made, forecasting through machine learning has become more important than ever. Moreover, as vaccines are being brought to the public and cases are going down, it is time that we reflect on where the pandemic has taken the most toll:for the purpose of future reform. This research illustrates two different models and algorithms for COVID-19 forecasting: Auto Regressive models and Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs). The results show the true potential of RNNs to work with sequential and time-series data to forecast future cases and deaths in different states. As the paper utilizes the tanh activation function and multiple LSTM layers, the research will show the importance of machine learning and its ability to help politicians make decisions when it comes to helping states during the pandemic and future reform. The data will also pre-process the time-series data, using rolling statistics and will clean the data for the auto-regressive model and RNN layers. Thus, we show that along with Recurrent Neural Network layers, activation functions also play a crucial role in the accuracy of the forecast.","Choudhary, A.",2021-03-17,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.03.15.21253571,1,Avi Choudhary,Basis Independent Silicon Valley,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.15.21253571v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.15.21253571v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
24056,Increased prevalence of AB group and FY*A red blood cell antigen in Caucasian SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma donors,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has put significant additional pressure on healthcare systems throughout the world. The identification of at-risk population beyond age, pre-existing medical conditions and socioeconomic status has been the subject of only a small part of the global COVID-19 research so far. To this day, the extent to which the red blood cell (RBC) antigens expressed by an individual can be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or clearance remains unknown.

MethodsThe phenotypes for ABO and RhD and the genotypes for 37 red blood cell (RBC) antigens were determined using high throughput platforms in 90 Caucasian convalescent plasma donors. The antigen frequencies were compared to the expected Caucasian frequencies using Z-tests for two-proportion.

ResultsThe AB phenotype and FY*A genotype frequencies were both independently and significantly increased (1.5x, p=0.018 and 2.2x, p=0.028, respectively) in the convalescent cohort (N=90) compared to reference frequencies. The AB phenotype was also significantly overrepresented (3.2x, p=0.028) within the FY*A sub-group (N=23). The O group was underrepresented within the cohort proportionally to the AB increase, although non-significantly (p=0.110). No other significant RBC antigen expression patterns in the convalescent Caucasian population were identified.

ConclusionAltogether, our study reveals ABO and Duffy RBC antigen variation among surviving, non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients turned convalescent plasma donors and contributes to the global advancement in understanding COVID-19 potential risk factors.","Trepanier, P.; Perreault, J.; Leiva, G.

At this time, new teaching modalities were employed to train the staff. This study aims to identify and quantify the effectiveness of these teaching models in terms of learning which was evaluated using case scenarios before and after the teaching session.

ObjectivesTo assess education methods and models for training of healthcare workers during rapid deployment at an ad-hoc dedicated COVID-19 hospital.

MethodsThe 5E (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate) teaching modality through peer group teaching methods was utilised in the situation. Statistical analysis was done using Mann Whitney U test.

ResultsA total of 86 participants (43 doctors and 43 nurses) answered the pre and post test questionnaires. The number of correct responses per question in the pre test (Mean + SD;49.0+ 18.53) vs post test (Mean + SD;54.40+ 15.95) with stratification by the domain of learning was analysed.

4510,Using ICU data to improve the real-time estimation of the effective reproductive number of the COVID-19 epidemic in 9 European countries,"1.We replicate a recent study by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team (Flaxman et al, 2020) that estimates both the effective reproductive number, Rt, of the current COVID-19 epidemic in 11 European countries, and the impact of different nonpharmaceutical interventions that have been implemented to try to contain the epidemic, including case isolation, the closure of schools and universities, banning of mass gatherings and/or public events, and most recently, widescale social distancing including local and national lockdowns. The main indicator they use for measuring the evolution of the epidemic is the daily number of deaths by COVID-19 in each country, which is a better statistic than the number of identified cases because it doesnt depend so much on the testing strategy that is in place in each country at each moment in time.

We improve on their estimation by using data from the number of patients in intensive care, which provides two advantages over the number of deaths: first, it can be used to construct a signal with less bias: as the healthcare system of a country reaches saturation, the mortality rate would be expected to increase, which would bias the estimates of Rt and of the impact of measures implemented to contain the epidemic; and second, it is a signal with less lag, as the time from onset of symptoms to ICU admission is shorter than the time from onset to death (on average, 7.5 days shorter). The intensive care signal we use is not just the number of people in ICU, as this would also be biased if the healthcare system has reached saturation (in this case, biased downwards, as admissions are no longer possible when all units are in use). Instead, we estimate the daily demand of intensive care, as the sum of two components: the part that is satisfied (new ICU admissions) and the part that is not (which results in excess mortality).

Thanks to the advantages of this ICU signal in terms of timeliness and bias, we find that most of the countries in the study have already reached Rt<1 with 95% confidence (Italy, Spain, Austria, Denmark, France, Norway and Switzerland, but not Belgium or Sweden), whereas the original methodology of Flaxman et al (2020), even with updated data, would only find Rt<1 with 95% confidence for Italy and Switzerland.","Hurtado, S.; Tinajero, D.",2020-04-17,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.13.20063388,1,Samuel Hurtado,NA,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063388v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063388v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
22100,How to decide which COVID-19 patient with myocardial infarction to send to the Cath Lab? - A case series of COVID-19 patients with myocardial infarction,"INTRODUCTIONThe Coronavirus pandemic has hit the world with its vast contagiousness, high morbidity, and mortality. Apart from the direct damage to the lung tissue, the corona virus infection is able to predispose patients to thrombotic disease, thus causing cerebral or coronary incidents.

AIMSThe aim of this study was to find a clinical or laboratory parameter, that would help in distinguishing between COVID-19 patients with myocardial infarction (MI), who have an infarct-related artery (IRA) and therefore, require immediate revascularization, and those, who have no IRA.

METHODSThis was a single-center, observational study of 10 consecutive patients with COVID-19, who were admitted with confirmed MI.

RESULTSIn our study group the mean age was 67.5 {+/-} 8.3 years, half of the patients were female; all of them had arterial hypertension; 8 patients (80%) had dyslipidemy; 4 (40%) had diabetes. 30% of the patients with MI did not have an IRA, and did not require pPCI. Patients with MI and IRA had significantly higher hsTrI values (48.9 {+/-} 43.2 vs 0.6 {+/-} 0.7, p=0.007) and exclusively typical chest pain 100% vs 0%, p=0.007), compared to patients with MI without an IRA. The ECG changes had only marginal statistical significance. Our results suggest that using a higher cut-off value for hsTrI (>7.5 times upper reference range) increases the specificity and positive predictive value for diagnosing a MI with the presence of IRA and need for pPCI, to 100%

CONCLUSIONIn our analysis we confirm that a higher cut-off value for hsTrI helps distinguish between COVID patients with MI, who have IRA and therefore, require immediate revascularization, compared to those, who have no IRA.","Simova, I.; Nikolov, D.; Dimitrov, N.; Kornovski, V.; Tomova, V.; Vekov, T.; Krasnaliev, Y.",2021-02-09,Cardiovascular Medicine,10.1101/2021.02.07.21251081,1,Denis Nikolov,University hospital Heart and brain - Pleven,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.07.21251081v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.07.21251081v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
4919,Multivariate Analysis of Factors Affecting COVID-19 Case and Death Rate in U.S. Counties: The Significant Effects of Black Race and Temperature,"ObjectivesCoronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly around the world, and many risk factors including patient demographics, social determinants of health, environmental variables, underlying health conditions, and adherence to social distancing have been hypothesized to affect case and death rates. However, little has been done to account for the potential confounding effects of these factors. Using a large multivariate analysis, this study illuminates modulators of COVID-19 incidence and mortality in U.S. counties while controlling for risk factors across multiple domains.

MethodsData on COVID-19 and various risk factors in all U.S. counties was collected from publicly available data sources through April 14, 2020. Counties with at least 50 COVID-19 cases were included in case analyses and those with at least 10 deaths were included in mortality models. The 661 counties meeting inclusion criteria for number of cases were grouped into quartiles and comparisons of risk factors were made using t-tests between the highest and lowest quartiles. Similar comparisons for 217 counties were made for above average and below average deaths/100,000. Adjusted linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the independent effects of factors that significantly impacted cases and deaths.

ResultsUnivariate analyses demonstrated numerous significant differences between cohorts for both cases and deaths. Risk factors associated with increased cases and/or deaths per 100,000 included increased GDP per capita, decreased social distancing, increased age, increased percent Black, decreased percent Hispanic, decreased percent Asian, decreased health, increased poverty, increased diabetes, increased coronary heart disease, increased physical inactivity, increased alcohol consumption, increased tobacco use, and decreased access to primary care. Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated Black race is a risk factor for worse COVID-19 outcome independent of comorbidities, poverty, access to health care, and other mitigating factors. Lower daily temperatures was also an independent risk factor in case load but not deaths.

ConclusionsU.S. counties with a higher proportion of Black residents are associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. However, the various suggested mechanisms, such as socioeconomic and healthcare predispositions, did not appear to drive the effect of race in our model. Counties with higher average daily temperatures are also associated with decreased COVID-19 cases but not deaths. Several theories are posited to explain these findings, including prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Additional studies are needed to further understand these effects.","Li, A. Y.; Hannah, T.

8379,"Did the National lockdown lock COVID-19 down in India, and reduce pressure on health infrastructure?","Background & objectivesThe spread of COVID-19 in India has posed a major challenge for policy makers. Policy response in form of imposition of a prolonged national lockdown has imposed substantial costs on the entire population. But the extent to which it has contained the spread of the epidemic needs to be assessed.

MethodsWe use an Interrupted Time Series model to assess the success of lockdowns in containing COVID-19. In the second step, we use four variants of the SIR models to develop a counterfactual--what would have happened without the lockdown. These results are compared with actual data. The analysis is undertaken for India, and Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu.

ResultsLockdown has reduced the number of COVID-19 cases by 23.65 to 337.73 lakh in Class I cities and towns, where COVID has mainly spread. It has averted about 0.01 to 0.10 lakh deaths. At the regional level, however, lockdown has averted a health crisis as existing ICU and ventilator facilities for critically ill patients would have been inadequate.

Interpretation & conclusionsOverall, the results for three of the four models reveal that lockdown has a modest impact on spread of COVID-19; the health infrastructure at the national level is not over strained, even at the peak. At the regional level, on the other hand, lockdowns may have been justified. However, given that identification of new cases is limited by levels of daily testing that are low even by Asian standards, analysis based upon official data may have limitations and result in flawed decisions.","Husain, Z.; Das, A.

23921,The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in different freshwater environments in urban settings determined by RT-qPCR: implications for water security,"This study is the first focused on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in different freshwater environments in an urban setting. Groundwater and surface water reservoirs for drinking water as well as water from receiving rivers of the Monterrey Metropolitan Area were sampled repeatedly during a SARS-CoV-2 peak phase between October 2020 and January 2021, and viral RNA was measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Forty-four percent of the groundwater samples had detectable viral loads between 2.6 and 38.3 copies/ml. A significant correlation between viral load and sucralose concentration in groundwater reaffirmed the hypothesis of leaching and infiltrating effluent from surface and/or failing sewage pipes and emphasized the importance of water disinfection. Twelve percent of the surface water dam samples tested positive for viral RNA, with values varying between 3.3 and 3.8 copies/ml. Finally, 13% of the river samples were positive for viral RNA, with concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 7.0 copies/ml. Untreated wastewater samples taken in the same period showed viral loads of up to 3535 copies/ml, demonstrating a dilution effect and/or wastewater facilities efficiency of three orders of magnitude. Variations in the viral loads in the groundwater and surface water over time and at the submetropolitan level generally reflected the reported trends in infection cases for Monterrey. The viral loads in the freshwater environments of Monterrey represent a low risk for recreational activities according to a preliminary risk assessment model. However, this result should not be taken lightly due to uncertainty regarding data and model constraints and the possibility of situations where the infection risk may increase considerably.","Mahlknecht, J.; Alonso-Padilla, D.; Ramos, E.; Reyes, L.

12118,Epidemiological and cohort study finds no association between COVID-19 and Guillain-Barre syndrome,"BackgroundReports of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) have emerged during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This epidemiological and cohort study sought to investigate any causative association between COVID-19 infection and GBS.

MethodsThe epidemiology of GBS cases reported via the UK National Immunoglobulin Database were studied from 2016-2019 and compared to cases reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. For the cohort study, members of the British Peripheral Nerve Society reported all cases of GBS during the pandemic. The clinical features, investigation findings and outcomes of COVID-19 (definite or probable) and non-COVID-19 associated GBS cases were compared.

ResultsThe UK GBS incidence from 2016-2019 was 1.65-1.88 per 100,000 people per year. GBS and COVID-19 incidence varied between regions and did not correlate (r = 0.06, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.63, p=0.86). GBS incidence fell between March and May 2020 compared to the same months of 2016-2019. Forty-seven GBS cases were included in the cohort study (13 definite, 12 probable COVID-19 and 22 non-COVID-19). There were no significant differences in the pattern of weakness, time to nadir, neurophysiology, CSF findings or outcome. Intubation was more frequent in the COVID-19+ve cohort (7/13, 54% vs 5/22, 23% in COVID negative) thought to be related directly to COVID-19 pulmonary involvement.

ConclusionsThis study finds no epidemiological or phenotypic clues of SARS-CoV-2 being causative of GBS. GBS incidence has fallen during the pandemic which may be the influence of lockdown measures reducing transmission of GBS inducing pathogens such as Campylobacter jejuni and respiratory viruses.","Keddie, S.; Pakpoor, J.; Mousele, C.; Pipis, M.; Machado, P.

7552,"Evaluate the risk of resumption of business for the states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut via a pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission model of COVID-19","The United States has the highest numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the world. The early hot spot states were New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. The workforce in these states was required to work from home except for essential services. It was necessary to evaluate an appropriate date for resumption of business since the premature reopening of the economy would lead to a broader spread of COVID-19, while the opposite situation would cause greater loss of economy. To reflect the real-time risk of the spread of COVID-19, it was crucial to evaluate the population of infected individuals before or never being confirmed due to the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmissions of COVID-19. To this end, we proposed an epidemic model and applied it to evaluate the real-time risk of epidemic for the states of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. We used California as the benchmark state because California began a phased reopening on May 8, 2020. The dates on which the estimated numbers of unidentified infectious individuals per 100,000 for states of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut were close to those in California on May 8, 2020, were June 1, 22, and 22, 2020, respectively. By the practice in California, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut might consider reopening their business. Meanwhile, according to our simulation models, to prevent resurgence of infections after reopening the economy, it would be crucial to maintain sufficient measures to limit the social distance after the resumption of businesses. This precaution turned out to be critical as the situation in California quickly deteriorated after our analysis was completed and its interventions after the reopening of business were not as effective as those in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.","Tian, T.; Tan, J.; Jiang, Y.; Wang, X.; Zhang, H.",2020-09-15,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.05.16.20103747,5,Heping Zhang,Yale University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.16.20103747v5?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.16.20103747v5.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.6339/21-JDS994
17067,Simulation and prediction of spread of COVID-19 in The Republic of Serbia by SEIRDS model of disease transmission,"As a response to the pandemic caused by SARS-Cov-2 virus, on 15 March, 2020, the Republic of Serbia introduced comprehensive anti-epidemic measures to curb COVID-19. After a slowdown in the epidemic, on 6 May, 2020, the regulatory authorities decided to relax the implemented measures. However, the epidemiological situation soon worsened again. As of 7 February, 2021, a total of 406,352 cases of SARSCov-2 infection have been reported in Serbia, 4,112 deaths caused by COVID-19. In order to better understand the epidemic dynamics and predict possible outcomes, we have developed an adaptive mathematical model SEAIHRDS (S-susceptible, E-exposed, A-asymptomatic, I-infected, H-hospitalized, R-recovered, D-dead due to COVID-19 infection, S-susceptible). The model can be used to simulate various scenarios of the implemented intervention measures and calculate possible epidemic outcomes, including the necessary hospital capacities. Considering promising results regarding the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, the model is extended to simulate vaccination among different population strata. The findings from various simulation scenarios have shown that, with implementation of strict measures of contact reduction, it is possible to control COVID-19 and reduce number of deaths. The findings also show that limiting effective contacts within the most susceptible population strata merits a special attention. However, the findings also show that the disease has a potential to remain in the population for a long time, likely with a seasonal pattern. If a vaccine, with efficacy equal or higher than 65%, becomes available it could help to significantly slow down or completely stop circulation of the virus in human population.

The effects of vaccination depend primarily on: 1. Efficacy of available vaccine(s), 2. Prioritization of the population categories for vaccination, and 3. Overall vaccination coverage of the population, assuming that the vaccine(s) develop solid immunity in vaccinated individuals. With expected basic reproduction number of Ro=2.46 and vaccine efficacy of 68%, an 87% coverage would be sufficient to stop the virus circulation.","Stanojevic, S.

7823,Susceptibility to and transmission of COVID-19 amongst children and adolescents compared with adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"ImportanceThe degree to which children and young people are infected by and transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus is unclear. The role of children and young people in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on susceptibility, symptoms, viral load, social contact patterns and behaviour.

ObjectiveWe undertook a rapid systematic review to address the question """"What is the susceptibility to and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children and adolescents compared with adults?""""

Data sourcesWe searched PubMed and medRxiv up to 28 July 2020 and identified 13,926 studies, with additional studies identified through handsearching of cited references and professional contacts.

Study SelectionWe included studies which provided data on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children and young people (<20 years) compared with adults derived from contact-tracing or population-screening. We excluded single household studies.

Data extraction and SynthesisWe followed PRISMA guidelines for abstracting data, independently by 2 reviewers. Quality was assessed using a critical appraisal checklist for prevalence studies. Random effects meta-analysis was undertaken.

Main OutcomesSecondary infection rate (contact-tracing studies) or prevalence or seroprevalence (population-screening studies) amongst children and young people compared with adults.

Results32 studies met inclusion criteria; 18 contact-tracing and 14 population-screening. The pooled odds ratio of being an infected contact in children compared with adults was 0.56 (0.37, 0.85) with substantial heterogeneity (95%). Three school contact tracing studies found minimal transmission by child or teacher index cases. Findings from population-screening studies were heterogenous and were not suitable for meta-analysis. The majority of studies were consistent with lower seroprevalence in children compared with adults, although seroprevalence in adolescents appeared similar to adults.

ConclusionsThere is preliminary evidence that children and young people have lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, with a 43% lower odds of being an infected contact. There is weak evidence that children and young people play a lesser role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at a population level. Our study provides no information on the infectivity of children.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the evidence on the susceptibility and transmission of children and young people to SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with adults?

FindingsIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, children and young people under 18-20 years had an 435 lower odds of secondary infection of with SARS-CoV-2 compared to adults 20 years plus, a significant difference. This finding was most marked in children under 12-14 years. Data were insufficient to conclude whether transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children is lower than by adults.

MeaningWe found preliminary evidence that children have a lower susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with adults, although data for adolescents is less clear.

3019,A Simple Mathematical Model for Estimating the Inflection Points of COVID-19 Outbreaks,"BackgroundExponential-like infection growths leading to peaks (which could be the inflection points or turning points) are usually the hallmarks of infectious disease outbreaks including coronaviruses. To predict the inflection points, i.e., inflection time (Tmax) & maximal infection number (Imax) of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), we adopted a trial and error strategy and explored a series of approaches from simple logistic modeling (that has an asymptomatic line) to sophisticated tipping point detection techniques for detecting phase transitions but failed to obtain satisfactory results.

MethodInspired by its success in diversity-time relationship (DTR), we apply the PLEC (power law with exponential cutoff) model for detecting the inflection points of COVID-19 outbreaks. The model was previously used to extend the classic species-time relationship (STR) for general DTR (Ma 2018), and it has two """"secondary"""" parameters (computed from its 3 parameters including power law scaling parameter w, taper-off parameter d to overwhelm virtually exponential growth ultimately, and a parameter c related to initial infections): one that was originally used for estimating the potential or  dark biodiversity is proposed to estimate the maximal infection number (Imax) and another is proposed to determine the corresponding inflection time point (Tmax).

ResultsWe successfully estimated the inflection points [Imax, Tmax] for most provinces ({approx}85%) in China with error rates <5% in both Imax and Tmax. We also discussed the constraints and limitations of the proposed approach, including (i) sensitive to disruptive jumps, (ii) requiring sufficiently long datasets, and (iii) limited to unimodal outbreaks.","Ma, Z.",2020-03-27,Health Informatics,10.1101/2020.03.25.20043893,1,Zhanshan (Sam) Ma,Chinese Academy of Sciences,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043893v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043893v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
14538,Vaccination for some childhood diseases may impact the outcome of covid-19 infections,"BackgroundCOVID-19 found the world in a state of unpreparedness. While research efforts to develop a vaccine are on-going, others have suggested the use of available vaccines to boost innate immunity.

ObjectiveWe analysed three databases: UNICEF Immunization Coverage, Worldometer Corona Virus Updates and World Bank List of Economies to establish the association, if any, between vaccination for various diseases and COVID-19 death rates and recoveries across world economies.

ResultsMean percentage death rates were lower in countries that vaccinated for Hepatitis-B birth dose (2.53% vs 3.79%, p = 0.001), Bacille Calmette-Guerin Vaccine (2.93% vs 5.10%, p = 0.025) and Inactivated Polio Vaccine 1st dose (2.8% vs 4.01%, p = 0.022) than those which did not report vaccination. In high income countries, a significant negative correlation with death rates was observed with vaccination for Measles-containing vaccine 2nd dose (r = -0.290, p = 0.032), Rubella-containing vaccine 1st dose (r = -0.325, p = 0.015), Hepatitis B 3rd dose (r = -0.562, p = 3.3 x10-5), Inactivated Polio vaccine 1st dose (r = -0.720, p = 0.008). Inactivated Polio Vaccine 1st dose and Measles-containing vaccine 2nd dose also correlated with better recoveries. In Low Income countries, only Rubella-containing vaccine correlated with lower deaths while Yellow fever vaccine was associated with poorer recoveries.

ConclusionOur analysis corroborates the potential benefit of vaccination and warrant further research to explore the rationale for repurposing other vaccines to fight COVID-19.","Gobe, I.; Koto, G.

9994,Development and validation of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay as a highly specific tool for determining past exposure to SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundThe Elecsys(R) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics) was developed to provide an accurate and reliable method for the detection of antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reactivity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay.

MethodsThe performance of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay was assessed at Roche Diagnostics (Penzberg, Germany). Sensitivity was evaluated using anonymised residual frozen samples from patients who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); one or more consecutive samples were collected from patients at various timepoints after PCR confirmation. Specificity was evaluated using anonymised unselected residual frozen samples from routine diagnostic testing or from blood donors; all samples were collected before December 2019 and thus deemed negative for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Cross-reactivity was evaluated using anonymised frozen samples containing a wide range of potentially cross-reacting analytes, which were purchased from commercial vendors. For sensitivity and specificity, point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.

ResultsSensitivity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay in 496 samples from 102 patients with prior PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was 99.5% (95% CI 97.0-100.0) at [&ge;]14 days after PCR confirmation. Overall specificity in 10,453 samples from routine diagnostic testing (n = 6305) and blood donors (n = 4148) was 99.80% (95% CI 99.69-99.88). Only 4/752 samples containing potential cross-reacting analytes were reactive with the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay, resulting in an overall specificity in this cohort of 99.5% (95% CI 98.6-99.9).

ConclusionThe Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay demonstrated a sensitivity of 99.5% at [&ge;]14 days after PCR confirmation and a very high specificity of 99.80%. Our findings support the use of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay as a tool for the identification of past SARS-CoV-2 infection, including in populations with a low disease prevalence.

4380,Challenges in control of Covid-19: short doubling time and long delay to effect of interventions,"The unconstrained growth rate of COVID-19 is crucial for measuring the impact of interventions, assessing worst-case scenarios, and calibrating mathematical models for policy planning. However, robust estimates are limited, with scientific focus on the time-insensitive basic reproduction number R0. Using multiple countries, data streams and methods, we consistently estimate that European COVID-19 cases doubled every three days when unconstrained, with the impact of physical distancing interventions typically seen about nine days after implementation, during which time cases grew eight-fold. The combination of fast growth and long detection delays explains the struggle in countries response better than large values of R0 alone, and warns against relaxing physical distancing measures too quickly. Testing and tracing are fundamental in shortening such delays, thus preventing cases from escalating unnoticed.","Pellis, L.; Scarabel, F.; Stage, H. B.; Overton, C. E.; Chappell, L. H.

21481,Distinctive features of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells predict recovery from severe COVID-19,"Although T cells are likely players in SARS-CoV-2 immunity, little is known about the phenotypic features of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells associated with recovery from severe COVID-19. We analyzed T cells from longitudinal specimens of 34 COVID-19 patients with severities ranging from mild (outpatient) to critical culminating in death. Relative to patients that succumbed, individuals that recovered from severe COVID-19 harbored elevated and increasing numbers of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells capable of homeostatic proliferation. In contrast, fatal COVID-19 displayed elevated numbers of SARS-CoV-2-specific regulatory T cells and a time-dependent escalation in activated bystander CXCR4+ T cells. Together with the demonstration of increased proportions of inflammatory CXCR4+ T cells in the lungs of severe COVID-19 patients, these results support a model whereby lung-homing T cells activated through bystander effects contribute to immunopathology, while a robust, non-suppressive SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response limits pathogenesis and promotes recovery from severe COVID-19.

BRIEF SUMMARYBy conducting CyTOF on total and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells from longitudinal specimens spanning the entire spectrum of COVID-19 diseases, Neidleman et al. demonstrate that spike-specific Th1 cells capable of IL7-dependent homeostatic proliferation predict survival from severe COVID-19, while Tregs and IL6+ CD8+ T cells recognizing spike predict fatal outcome. Fatal COVID-19 is characterized by escalating activation of bystander CXCR4+ T cells in the lungs. Boosting SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T effector responses while diminishing CXCR4-mediated homing may help recovery from severe disease.","Neidleman, J.; Luo, X.; George, A.

2080,Genomic variations of SARS-CoV-2 suggest multiple outbreak sources of transmission,"We examined 169 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and found that they can be classified into two major genotypes, Type I and Type II. Type I can be further divided into Type IA and IB. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that the Type IA resembles the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 most. Type II was likely evolved from Type I and predominant in the infections. Our results suggest that Type II SARS-CoV-2 was the source of the outbreak in the Wuhan Huanan market and it was likely originated from a super-spreader. The outbreak caused by the Type I virus should have occurred somewhere else, because the patients had no direct link to the market. Furthermore, by analyzing three genomic sites that distinguish Type I and Type II strains, we found that synonymous changes at two of the three sites confer higher protein translational efficiencies in Type II strains than in Type I strains, which might explain why Type II strains are predominant, implying that Type II is more contagious (transmissible) than Type I. These findings could be valuable for the current epidemic prevention and control.","Zhang, L.; Yang, J.-R.; Zhang, Z.; Lin, Z.",2020-03-05,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.02.25.20027953,2,Liangsheng Zhang,FAfu,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027953v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027953v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
2622,Highly accurate and sensitive diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2 by digital PCR,"BACKGROUNDThe outbreak of COVID-19 caused by a novel Coronavirus (termed SARS-CoV-2) has spread to over 140 countries around the world. Currently, reverse transcription quantitative qPCR (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2. However, the positive rate of RT-qPCR assay of pharyngeal swab samples are reported to vary from 30[~]60%. More accurate and sensitive methods are urgently needed to support the quality assurance of the RT-qPCR or as an alternative diagnostic approach.

METHODSWe established a reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2 on 194 clinical pharyngeal swab samples, including 103 suspected patients, 75 close contacts and 16 supposed convalescents.

RESULTSThe limit of blanks (LoBs) of the RT-dPCR assays were [~]1.6, [~]1.6 and [~]0.8 copies/reaction for ORF 1ab, N and E genes, respectively. The limit of detection (LoD) was 2 copies/reaction. For the 103 fever suspected patients, the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection was significantly improved from 28.2% by RT-qPCR to 87.4% by RT-dPCR. For close contacts, the suspect rate was greatly decreased from 21% down to 1%. The overall sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of RT-dPCR were 90%, 100% and 93 %, respectively. In addition, quantification of the viral load for convalescents by RT-dPCR showed that a longer observation period was needed in the hospital for elderly patients.

CONCLUSIONRT-dPCR could be a confirmatory method for suspected patients diagnosed by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, RT-dPCR was more sensitive and suitable for low viral load specimens from the both patients under isolation and those under observation who may not be exhibiting clinical symptoms.","Dong, L.; Zhou, J.; Niu, C.; Wang, Q.; Pan, Y.; Sheng, S.; Wang, X.; Zhang, Y.; Yang, J.; Liu, M.; Zhao, Y.; Zhang, X.; Zhu, T.; Peng, T.; Xie, J.; Gao, Y.; Wang, D.; Zhao, Y.; Dai, X.; Fang, X.",2020-03-30,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.03.14.20036129,2,Xinhua Dai,National institute of metrology China,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.14.20036129v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.14.20036129v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.talanta.2020.121726
16449,Summer School Holidays and the Growth Rate in Sars-CoV-2 Infections Across German Districts,"ObjectivesTo estimate the effect that summer school holidays had on the growth rate in Sars-CoV-2 infections across German districts. The Robert-Koch-Institute reports that during the summer holiday period a foreign country is stated as the most likely place of infection for an average of 27 and a maximum of 49 percent of new Sars-CoV-2 infections in Germany. Yet, infection may have taken place elsewhere, not all international travel is holiday-related and any impact of holiday-related travel will not be restricted to holidays abroad.

DesignCross-sectional study on observational data. In Germany, summer school holidays are coordinated between states and spread out over 13 weeks. We analyse the association between these holidays and the weekly infection growth rate in SARS-CoV-2 infections across 401 German districts. Employing a dynamic model with district fixed effects, we test whether the holiday season results in a statistically significantly higher infection growth rate than the period of two weeks before holidays start, our presumed counterfactual.

ResultsWe find effects of the holiday period equal in size to almost 50 percent of the average district growth rate in new infections in Germany during their respective final week of holidays and the two weeks after holidays end. States in the West of Germany tend to experience stronger effects than those in the East. This is consistent with another result, namely that we find statistically significant interaction effects of school holidays with per capita taxable income and the share of foreign residents in a districts population, with both factors hypothesised to increase holiday-related travels.

ConclusionsOur results suggest that changed behaviour during the holiday season accelerated the pandemic and made it considerably more difficult for public health authorities to contain the spread of the virus by means of contact tracing. Governments did not prepare adequately or timely for this acceleration.","Pluemper, T.; Neumayer, E.",2020-11-10,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.10.11.20210773,2,Thomas Pluemper,Vienna University of Economics and Business,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.11.20210773v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.11.20210773v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
24609,Global-scale analysis and longitudinal assessment of COVID-19 incidence in the first six months,"Studies examining factors responsible for COVID-19 incidence have mostly focused at the national or sub-national level. Here we undertake an analysis of COVID-19 cases at the global scale to identify key factors associated with disease incidence. A regression modeling framework was used to identify key variables associated with COVID-19 incidence, and to assess longitudinal trends in reported incidence at the country-level. New COVID-19 case dynamics in response to lockdowns was characterized via cluster analysis. Eleven variables were found to be independently associated with COVID-19 infections (p<1e-05) and a 4-variable model adequately explained global variations in COVID-19 cases (p<0.01). COVID-19 case trajectories for most countries followed the log-logistic curve. Six predominant country clusters summarized the differences in individual countrys response to lockdowns. Globally, economic and meteorological factors are important determinants of COVID-19 incidence. Analysis of longitudinal trends and lockdown effects on COVID-19 caseloads further highlights important nuances in country-specific responses to the pandemic. These findings on the first six months of the pandemic has important implications for additional phases of the disease currently underway in many countries.","Ghosh, S.; Roy, S.

22460,"Clinical evaluation of the Abbott Alinity SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific quantitative IgG and IgM assays in infected, recovered, and vaccinated groups","The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impose a significant burden on global health infrastructure. While identification and containment of new cases remains important, laboratories must now pivot and consider assessment of SARS-CoV-2 immunity in the setting of the recent availability of multiple COVID-19 vaccines. Here we have utilized the latest Abbott Alinity semi-quantitative IgM and quantitative IgG spike protein (SP) serology assays (IgMSP and IgGSP) in combination with Abbott Alinity IgG nucleocapsid (NC) antibody test (IgGNC) to assess antibody responses in a cohort of 1236 unique participants comprised of naive, SARS-CoV-2 infected, and vaccinated (including both naive and recovered) individuals. The IgMSP and IgGSP assays were highly specific (100%) with no cross-reactivity to archived samples recovered prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, including those from individuals with seasonal coronavirus infections. Clinical sensitivity was 96% after 15 days for both IgMSP and IgGSP assays individually. When considered together, the sensitivity was 100%. A combination of NC- and SP-specific serologic assays clearly differentiated naive, SARS-CoV-2-infected, and vaccine-related immune responses. Vaccination resulted in a significant increase in IgGSP and IgMSP titers, with a major rise in IgGSP following the booster (second) dose in the naive group. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals had several fold higher IgGSP responses than naive following the primary dose, with a comparatively dampened response following the booster. This work illustrates the strong clinical performance of these new serological assays and their utility in evaluating and distinguishing serological responses to infection and vaccination.","Narasimhan, M.; Mahimainathan, L.; Raj, E.; Clark, A.

Further, the rate of growth of infections in India is very close to that in Washington and California. Exponential and classic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models based on available data are used to make short and long-term predictions on a daily basis. Based on the SIR model, it is estimated that India will enter equilibrium by the end of May 2020 with the final epidemic size of approximately 13,000. However, this estimation will be invalid if India enters the stage of community transmission. The impact of social distancing, again with the assumption of no community transmission, is also assessed by comparing data from different geographical locations.","Ranjan, R.",2020-04-12,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.02.20051466,2,Rajesh Ranjan,The Ohio State University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051466v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051466v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
5803,Individual variation in susceptibility or exposure to SARS-CoV-2 lowers the herd immunity threshold,"As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads, the susceptible subpopulation is depleted causing the incidence of new cases to decline. Variation in individual susceptibility or exposure to infection exacerbates this effect. Individuals that are more susceptible or more exposed tend to be infected earlier, depleting the susceptible subpopulation of those who are at higher risk of infection. This selective depletion of susceptibles intensifies the deceleration in incidence. Eventually, susceptible numbers become low enough to prevent epidemic growth or, in other words, the herd immunity threshold (HIT) is reached. Although estimates vary, simple calculations suggest that herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 requires 60-70% of the population to be immune. By fitting epidemiological models that allow for heterogeneity to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks across the globe, we show that variation in susceptibility or exposure to infection reduces these estimates. Accurate measurements of heterogeneity are therefore of paramount importance in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.

5422,Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil,"BackgroundThe first case of COVID-19 was detected in Brazil on February 25, 2020. We report the epidemiological, demographic, and clinical findings for confirmed COVID-19 cases during the first month of the epidemic in Brazil.

MethodsIndividual-level and aggregated COVID-19 data were analysed to investigate demographic profiles, socioeconomic drivers and age-sex structure of COVID-19 tested cases. Basic reproduction numbers (R0) were investigated for Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify symptoms associated with confirmed cases and risk factors associated with hospitalization. Laboratory diagnosis for eight respiratory viruses were obtained for 2,429 cases.

FindingsBy March 25, 1,468 confirmed cases were notified in Brazil, of whom 10% (147 of 1,468) were hospitalised. Of the cases acquired locally (77{middle dot}8%), two thirds (66{middle dot}9% of 5,746) were confirmed in private laboratories. Overall, positive association between higher per capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. The median age of detected cases was 39 years (IQR 30-53). The median R0 was 2{middle dot}9 for Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Cardiovascular disease/hypertension were associated with hospitalization. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses, including influenza A and B and human rhinovirus was detected in low levels.

InterpretationSocioeconomic disparity determines access to SARS-CoV-2 testing in Brazil. The lower median age of infection and hospitalization compared to other countries is expected due to a younger population structure. Enhanced surveillance of respiratory pathogens across socioeconomic statuses is essential to better understand and halt SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

9578,Estimating the impact of physical distancing measures in containing COVID-19: an empirical analysis,"BackgroundEpidemic modelling studies predict that physical distancing is critical in containing COVID-19. However, few empirical studies have validated this finding. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of different physical distancing measures in controlling viral transmission.

MethodsWe identified three distinct physical distancing measures with varying intensity and implemented at different times--international travel controls, restrictions on mass gatherings, and lockdown-type measures--based on the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. We also estimated the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) for 142 countries and tracked Rt temporally for two weeks following the 100th reported case in each country. We regressed Rt on the physical distancing measures and other control variables (income, population density, age structure, and temperature) and performed several robustness checks to validate our findings.

FindingsComplete travel bans and all forms of lockdown-type measures have been effective in reducing average Rt over the 14 days following the 100th case. Recommended stay-at-home advisories and partial lockdowns are as effective as complete lockdowns in outbreak control. However, these measures have to be implemented early to be effective. Lockdown-type measures should be instituted two weeks before the 100th case and travel bans about a week before detection of the first case.

InterpretationA combination of physical distancing measures, if implemented early, can be effective in containing COVID-19--tight border controls to limit importation of cases, encouraging physical distancing, moderately stringent measures such as working from home, and a full lockdown in the case of a probable uncontrolled outbreak.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSEvidence on the impact of physical distancing measures on containing COVID-19 has primarily relied on epidemic modelling studies. As cases accumulate worldwide, it has become possible to use empirical data to validate the model-based findings. The few empirical studies that analyze global case data find that lockdowns and international travel restrictions are important, but have not explored, beyond these broad findings, the intensity and timeliness of the various measures to inform policymaking.

Added value of this studyWe assessed, at a normalized stage of the epidemic curve, how the intensity and implementation timing of various physical distancing measures in 142 countries affect viral transmission, measured by the time-varying reproduction number (Rt). Other similar empirical studies treat the measures as binary variables, do not address the potential confounding effect of increased caseload on transmission, and do not use Rt as the primary metric.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur results support the findings in modelling studies, and subsequent empirical studies, that physical distancing measures can limit disease spread. We found that full border control and complete lockdowns are effective, but less stringent measures such as stay-at-home recommendations and working from home are as effective. As such, the framing of lockdown measures as a binary approach may be counterproductive. Overall, these measures are only effective if they are implemented early.","Koh, W.

We conducted a systematic literature review to assess child-to-child and child-to-adult SARS-CoV-2 transmission and to characterise the potential role of school closures on community transmission. 1337 peer-reviewed articles published through August 31, 2020 were screened; 22 were included in this review. The literature appraised provides sufficient evidence that children can both be infected by and transmit SARS-CoV-2 in community, household and school settings. Transmission by children was most frequently documented in household settings, while examples of children as index cases in school settings were rare. Included studies suggested that school closures may help to reduce SARS- CoV-2 transmission, but the societal, economic, and educational impacts of prolonged school closures must be considered. In-school mitigation measures, alongside continuous surveillance and assessment of emerging evidence, will promote the protection and educational attainment of students and support the educational workforce.","Suk, J.

8428,Determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Saudi Arabia: a web-based national survey,"BackgroundVaccine hesitancy is a potential threat to global public health. Since, there is an unprecedented global effort to develop a vaccine against the COVID-19 pandemic, much less is known about its acceptance in the community. Understanding key determinants that influence the preferences and demands of a future vaccine by the community may help to develop strategies for improving the global vaccination program. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine, and their determinants among people in Saudi Arabia.

MethodsA web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted using snowball sampling strategy under a highly restricted environment. A bilingual, self-administered anonymous questionnaire was designed and sent to 1000 study participants through social media platforms and email. Study participants were recruited across the country, including the four major cities (Riyadh, Dammam, Jeddah, and Abha) in Saudi Arabia. Associations between COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and sociodemographic profile of the respondents were explored using the chi-squared test. Key determinants that predict vaccine acceptance among respondents were modelled using logistic regression analysis.

ResultsOf the 1000 survey invitees, 992 responded to the survey (response rate, 99.2%). The majority (65.8%) of the study participants were female, 29.53% were in the age group (36-45 years), and 17.9% were non-Saudi. Of the 992 respondents, 642 (64.72%) showed interest to accept the COVID-19 vaccine if it is available. Willingness to accept the future COVID-19 vaccine is relatively high among older age groups (79.2% among 45+ year old), being married (69.3%), participants with education level postgraduate degree or higher (68.8%), non-Saudi (69.1%), employed in government sector (68.9%). In multivariate model, respondents who were above 45 years (aOR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.08-3.21), and married (aOR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.28-2.50) were significantly associated with vaccine acceptance (p <.05). Besides, people having trust in the health system were most likely to accept the vaccine (aOR: 3.05; 95% CI: 1.13-4.92), and those having a higher perceived risk of acquiring infection were 2.13 times (95% CI: 1.35-3.85) higher odds of accepting the vaccine.

ConclusionAddressing sociodemographic determinants relating to the COVID-19 vaccination may help to increase uptake of the global vaccination program to tackle future pandemics.

8048,A Noncooperative Game Analysis for Controlling COVID-19 Outbreak,"COVID-19 is a global epidemic. Till now, there is no remedy for this epidemic. However, isolation and social distancing are seemed to be effective to control this pandemic. In this paper, we provide an analytical model on the effectiveness of the sustainable lockdown policy that accommodates both isolation and social distancing features of the individuals. To promote social distancing, we analyze a noncooperative game environment that provides an incentive for maintaining social distancing. Furthermore, the sustainability of the lockdown policy is also interpreted with the help of a game-theoretic incentive model for maintaining social distancing. Finally, an extensive numerical analysis is provided to study the impact of maintaining a social-distancing measure to prevent the Covid-19 outbreak. Numerical results show that the individual incentive increases more than 85% with an increasing percentage of home isolation from 25% to 100% for all considered scenarios. The numerical results also demonstrate that in a particular percentage of home isolation, the individual incentive decreases with an increasing number of individuals.","Bairagi, A.

However, data on viral loads and antibody kinetics in immunocompromised populations are lacking. We aimed to determine nasopharyngeal and plasma viral loads via RT-PCR and SARS-CoV-2 serology via ELISA and study their association with severe forms of COVID-19 and death in kidney transplant recipients. In this study we examined hospitalized kidney transplant recipients with non-severe (n = 21) and severe (n =19) COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal and plasma viral load and serological response were evaluated based on outcomes and disease severity. Ten recipients (25%) displayed persistent viral shedding 30 days after symptom onset. The SARS-CoV-2 viral load of the upper respiratory tract was not associated with severe COVID-19, whereas the plasma viral load was associated with COVID-19 severity (p=0.0087) and mortality (p=0.024). All patients harbored antibodies the second week after symptom onset that persisted for two months. We conclude that plasma viral load is associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, whereas nasopharyngeal viral load is not. SARS-CoV-2 shedding is prolonged in kidney transplant recipients and the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 does not show significant impairment in this series of transplant recipients.","Benotmane, I.; Gautier-Vargas, G.; Wendling, M.-J.; Perrin, P.; Velay, A.; Bassand, X.; Bedo, D.; Baldacini, C.; Sagnard, M.; Bozman, D.-F.; Della-Chiesa, M.; Solis, M.; Gallais, F.; Cognard, N.; Olagne, J.; Delagreverie, H.; Gontard, L.; Panaget, B.; Marx, D.; Heibel, F.; Braun-Parvez, L.; Moulin, B.; Caillard, S.; Fafi-Kremer, S.",2020-06-19,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.17.20132076,1,Samira Fafi-Kremer,"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.17.20132076v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.17.20132076v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1111/ajt.16251
19798,Fundamental Limitations of Contact Tracing for COVID-19,"Contact tracing has played a central role in COVID-19 control in many jurisdictions and is often used in conjunction with other measures such as travel restrictions and social distancing mandates. Contact tracing is made ineffective, however, by delays in testing, calling, and isolating. Even if delays are minimized, contact tracing can only prevent a fraction of onward transmissions from contacts. Without other measures in place, contact tracing alone is insufficient to prevent exponential growth in the number of cases. Even when used effectively with other measures, occasional bursts in call loads can overwhelm contact tracing systems and lead to a loss of control. We propose embracing approaches to COVID-19 control that broadly test individuals without symptoms, in whatever way is economically feasible - either with fast cheap tests that can be deployed widely, with pooled testing, or with screening of judiciously chosen groups of high-risk individuals. Only by ramping up testing of asymptomatic individuals can we avoid the inherent delays that limit the efficacy of contact tracing.","Tupper, P.

5486,Extensions of the SEIR Model for the Analysis of Tailored Social Distancing and Tracing Approaches to Cope with COVID-19,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments worldwide face the challenge of designing tailored measures of epidemic control to provide reliable health protection while allowing societal and economic activity. In this paper, we propose an extension of the epidemiological SEIR model to enable a detailed analysis of commonly discussed tailored measures of epidemic control--among them group-specific protection and the use of tracing apps. We introduce groups into the SEIR model that may differ both in their underlying parameters as well as in their behavioral response to public health interventions. Moreover, we allow for different infectiousness parameters within and across groups, different asymptomatic, hospitalization, and lethality rates, as well as different take-up rates of tracing apps. We then examine predictions from these models for a variety of scenarios. Our results visualize the sharp trade-offs between different goals of epidemic control, namely a low death toll, avoiding overload of the health system, and a short duration of the epidemic. We show that a combination of tailored mechanisms, e.g., the protection of vulnerable groups together with a """"trace & isolate"""" approach, can be effective in preventing a high death toll. Protection of vulnerable groups without further measures requires unrealistically strict isolation. A key insight is that high compliance is critical for the effectiveness of a """"trace & isolate"""" approach. Our model allows to analyze the interplay of group-specific social distancing and tracing also beyond our case study in scenarios with a large number of groups reflecting, e.g., sectoral, regional, or age differentiation and group-specific behavioral responses.","Grimm, V.; Mengel, F.; Schmidt, M.",2020-12-10,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.24.20078113,2,Martin Schmidt,Trier University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.24.20078113v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.24.20078113v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1038/s41598-021-83540-2

Results4879 respondents (71.0% women; 67.4% 65-79 years) reported that in the preceding week, 43.1% felt lonely at least some of the time, including 8.3% that felt lonely always or often. Women had increased odds of loneliness compared to men, whether living alone (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 1.52 [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.13-2.04]) or with others (2.44 [95% CI 2.04-2.92]). Increasing age group decreased the odds of loneliness (aOR 0.69 [95% CI 0.59-0.81] 65-79 years and 0.50 [95% CI 0.39-0.65] 80+ years compared to <65 years). Living alone was associated with loneliness, with a greater association in men (aOR 4.26 [95% CI 3.15-5.76]) than women (aOR 2.65 [95% CI 2.26-3.11]). Other factors associated with loneliness included: fair or poor health (aOR 1.93 [95% CI 1.54-2.41]), being a caregiver (aOR 1.18 [95% CI 1.02-1.37]), receiving care (aOR 1.47 [95% CI 1.19-1.81]), high concern for the pandemic (aOR 1.55 [95% CI 1.31-1.84]), not experiencing positive effects of pandemic distancing measures (aOR 1.94 [95% CI 1.62-2.32]), and changes to daily routine (aOR 2.81 [95% CI 1.96-4.03]).

ConclusionsWhile many older adults reported feeling lonely during COVID-19, several characteristics - such as being female and living alone - increased the odds of loneliness. These characteristics may help identify priorities for targeting interventions to reduce loneliness.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThis survey study leveraged a strong community-based partnership to obtain timely data from a large sample of older Canadians on the impacts of COVID-19.
C_LIO_LIThis study identified several characteristics that increased the odds of loneliness, which may help to identify priorities for targeted interventions to reduce loneliness.
C_LIO_LIThe data were based on a convenience sample of retired, educational staff, who are not fully representative of the Canadian population. The perspectives of vulnerable groups who may be at greater risk for loneliness (e.g. those with severe mental health illness, low income, no home internet access, etc.) are likely underrepresented in this sample.

19751,Development of a Rapid Point-Of-Care Test that Measures Neutralizing Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2,"As increasing numbers of people recover from and are vaccinated against COVID-19, tests are needed to measure levels of protective, neutralizing antibodies longitudinally to help determine duration of immunity. We developed a lateral flow assay (LFA) that measures levels of neutralizing antibodies in plasma, serum or whole blood. The LFA is based on the principle that neutralizing antibodies inhibit binding of the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The LFA compares favorably with authentic SARS-CoV-2 and pseudotype neutralization assays with an accuracy of 98%. Sera obtained from patients with seasonal coronaviruses did not prevent RBD from binding to ACE2. To demonstrate the usefulness of the LFA for measuring antibodies in convalescent plasma used for therapy, we measured conversion of non-immune plasma into strongly neutralizing plasma. This is the first report of a neutralizing antibody test that is rapid, highly portable and relatively inexpensive that might be useful in assessing COVID-19 vaccine-induced immunity.","Lake, D.

19532,"Risk factors for retirement home COVID-19 outbreaks in Ontario, Canada: A population-level cohort study","BackgroundThe epidemiology of COVID-19 in retirement homes (also known as assisted living facilities) is largely unknown. We examined the association between retirement home and community level characteristics and the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks in retirement homes during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic.

MethodsWe conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of licensed retirement homes in Ontario, Canada, from March 1st - September 24th, 2020. Our primary outcome was a COVID-19 outbreak ([&ge;]1 resident or staff confirmed case by validated nucleic acid amplification assay). We used time-dependent proportional hazards methods to model the associations between retirement home and community level characteristics and COVID-19 outbreaks.

ResultsOur cohort included all 770 licensed retirement homes in Ontario, which housed 56,491 residents. There were 172 (22.3%) COVID-19 retirement home outbreaks involving 1,045 (1.9%) residents and 548 staff (1.5%). COVID-19 cases were distributed unevenly across retirement homes, with 1,593 (92.2%) resident and staff cases occurring in 77 (10%) of homes. The adjusted hazard of a COVID-19 outbreak in a retirement home was positively associated with homes that had a large resident capacity, homes that were co-located with a long-term care facility, large corporate owned chains, homes that offered many services onsite, increases in regional COVID-19 incidence, and a higher community-level ethnic concentration.

InterpretationReadily identifiable retirement home-level characteristics are independently associated with COVID-19 outbreaks and may support risk identification. A higher ethnic concentration of the community surrounding a retirement home is associated COVID-19 outbreaks, with an uncertain mechanism.","Costa, A. P.; Manis, D. R.; Jones, A.; Stall, N.

14866,Vitamin D and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity in the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative: A Mendelian randomization study,"BackgroundIncreased vitamin D levels, as reflected by 25OHD measurements, have been proposed to protect against COVID-19 disease based on in-vitro, observational, and ecological studies. However, vitamin D levels are associated with many confounding variables and thus associations described to date may not be causal. Vitamin D Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have provided results that are concordant with large-scale vitamin D randomized trials. Here, we used two-sample MR to assess evidence supporting a causal effect of circulating 25OHD levels on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.

Methods and findingsGenetic variants strongly associated with 25OHD levels in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 443,734 participants of European ancestry (including 401,460 from the UK Biobank) were used as instrumental variables. GWASs of COVID-19 susceptibility, hospitalization, and severe disease from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative were used as outcome GWASs. These included up to 14,134 individuals with COVID-19, and 1,284,876 without COVID-19, from 11 countries. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was determined by laboratory testing or medical chart review. Population controls without COVID-19 were also included in the control groups for all outcomes, including hospitalization and severe disease. Analyses were restricted to individuals of European descent when possible. Using inverse-weighted MR, genetically increased 25OHD levels by one standard deviation on the logarithmic scale had no significant association with COVID-19 susceptibility (OR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.10; P=0.61), hospitalization (OR = 1.11; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.35; P=0.30), and severe disease (OR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.17; P=0.53). We used an additional 6 meta-analytic methods, as well as sensitivity analyses after removal of variants at risk of horizontal pleiotropy and obtained similar results. These results may be limited by weak instrument bias in some analyses. Further, our results do not apply to individuals with vitamin D deficiency.

ConclusionIn this two-sample MR study, we did not observe evidence to support an association between 25OHD levels and COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, or hospitalization. Hence, vitamin D supplementation as a means of protecting against worsened COVID-19 outcomes is not supported by genetic evidence. Other therapeutic or preventative avenues should be given higher priority for COVID-19 randomized controlled trials.

Author SummaryO_LIWhy was this study done?
- Vitamin D levels have been associated with COVID-19 outcomes in multiple observational studies, though confounders are likely to bias these associations.
- By using genetic instruments which limit such confounding, Mendelian randomization studies have consistently obtained results concordant with vitamin D supplementation randomized trials. This provides rationale to undertake vitamin D Mendelian randomization studies for COVID-19 outcomes.

C_LIO_LIWhat did the researchers do and find?
- We used the genetic variants obtained from the largest consortium of COVID-19 cases and controls, and the largest study on genetic determinants of vitamin D levels.
- We used Mendelian randomization to estimate the effect of increased vitamin D on COVID-19 outcomes, while limiting confounding.
- In multiple analyses, our results consistently showed no evidence for an association between genetically predicted vitamin D levels and COVID-19 susceptibility, hospitalization, or severe disease.

C_LIO_LIWhat do these findings mean?
- Using Mendelian randomization to reduce confounding that has traditionally biased vitamin D observational studies, we did not find evidence that vitamin D supplementation in the general population would improve COVID-19 outcomes
- These findings, together with recent randomized controlled trial data, suggest that other therapies should be prioritized for COVID-19 trials.

13840,Forecasting PPE Consumption during a Pandemic: The Case of Covid-19,"Due to the global shortage of PPE caused by increasing number of COVID-19 patients in recent months, many hospitals have had difficulty procuring adequate PPE for the clinicians who care for these patients. Faced with a shortage, hospitals have had to implement new PPE conservation policies. In this paper, we describe a tool to help hospitals better project PPE needs under various conservation policies. Though this tool is built on top of projections of the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it is agnostic as to which model--of which many are available--provides these projections. The tool combines COVID-19 patient census projections with information like staffing ratios and frequency of patient contact to provide projections of the number of items of key types of PPE needed under three built-in conservation scenarios: standard, contingency, and crisis. Users are also able to customize the tool to the specifics of their hospital and design custom conservation policies.","Lum, K.; Johndrow, J.; Cardone, A.; Fuchs, B.; Cotner, C.; Jew, O.; Parikh, R.; Draugelis, M.; Luong, T.; Hanish, A.; Weissman, G.

An application of spatial temporal model,"Background: COVID-19 has been the greatest challenge the world has faced since the second world war. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of COVID-19 in both space and time in Malawi. Methods: The study used publicly available data of COVID-19 cases for the period from 24th June to 20th August, 2020. Semiparametric spatial temporal models were fitted to the number of weekly confirmed cases as an outcome data, with time and location as independent variables. Results: The study found significant main effect of location and time with the two interacting. The spatial distribution of COVID-19 showed major cities being at greater risk than rural areas. Over time the COVID-19 risk was increasing then decreasing in most districts with the rural districts being consistently at lower risk. Conclusion. Future or present strategies to avert the spread of COVID-19 should target major cities by limiting international exposure. In addition, the focus should be on time points that had shown high risk.","Ngwira, A.; Kumwenda, F.; Munthali, E.; Nkolokosa, D.",2020-09-14,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.12.20192914,1,Alfred Ngwira Sr.,Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.12.20192914v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.12.20192914v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.7717/peerj.11003
11468,Maternal and perinatal characteristics and outcomes of pregnancies complicated with COVID-19 in Kuwait,"BackgroundIn late December of 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in the Chinese city Wuhan among a cluster of pneumonia patients. While it is known that pregnant women have reduced immunity and they are at risk for COVID-19 infection during the current pandemic, it is not clear if the disease manifestation would be different in pregnant women from non-pregnant women.

ObjectivesTo describe the maternal and neonatal clinical features as well as outcome of pregnancies complicated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsIn this retrospective national-based study, we analyzed the medical records of all SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant patients and their neonates who were admitted to New-Jahra Hospital, Kuwait, between March 15th 2020 and May 31st 2020. The outcomes of pregnancies were assessed until the end date of follow-up (June 15th 2020).

ResultsA total of 185 pregnant women were enrolled with a median age of 31 years (interquartile range, IQR: 27.5-34), and median gestational age at diagnosis was 29 weeks (IQR: 18-34). The majority (88%) of the patients had mild symptoms, with fever (58%) being the most common presenting symptom followed by cough (50.6%). During the study period, 141 (76.2%) patients continued their pregnancy, 3 (1.6%) had a miscarriage, 1 (0.5%) had intrauterine fetal death and only 2 (1.1%) patients developed severe pneumonia and required intensive care. Most of the neonates were asymptomatic, and only 2 (5%) of them tested positive on day 5 by nasopharyngeal swab testing.

ConclusionPregnant women do not appear to be at higher risk to the COVID-19 than the general population. The clinical features of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar to those of the general population having SARS-CoV-2 infection. Favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes reinforce the existing evidence and may guide healthcare professionals in the management of pregnancies complicated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ayed, A.; Embaireeg, A.; Benawadth, A.; Al-Fouzan, W.; Hammoud, M.; Alhathal, M.; Alzaydai, A.; Ayed, M.",2020-07-14,Obstetrics And Gynecology,10.1101/2020.07.10.20150623,1,Mariam Ayed,"Neonatal Department, Farwaniya Hospital, Kuwait",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150623v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150623v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1186/s12884-020-03461-2

4956,The current COVID-19 wave will likely be mitigated in the second-line European countries,"ObjectiveCountries presently apply different strategies to control the COVID-19 outbreak. Differences in population structures, decision making, health systems and numerous other factors result in various trajectories in terms of mortality at country scale. Our objective in this manuscript is to disentangle the future of second-line European countries (i.e. countries that present, today, a moderate death rate) with respect to the current COVID-19 wave.

MethodWe propose a data-driven approach, grounded on a mixture model, to forecast the dynamics of the number of deaths from COVID-19 in a given focal country using data from countries that are ahead in time in terms of COVID-19-induced mortality. In this approach, the mortality curves of ahead-in-time countries are used to build predictors, which are then used as the components of the mixture model. This approach was applied to eight second-line European countries (Austria, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Sweden), using Belgium, France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom as well as the Hubei province in China to build predictors. For this analysis, we used data pooled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.

ResultsIn general, the second-line European countries tend to follow relatively mild mortality curves (typically, those of Switzerland and Hubei) rather than fast and severe ones (typically, those of Spain, Italy, Belgium, France and the United Kingdom). From a methodological viewpoint, the performance of our forecasting approach is about 80% up to 8 days in the future, as soon as the focal country has accumulated at least two hundreds of deaths.

DiscussionOur results suggest that the continuation of the current COVID-19 wave across Europe will likely be mitigated, and not as strong as it was in most of the front-line countries first impacted by the wave.","Soubeyrand, S.; Ribaud, M.; Baudrot, V.; Allard, D.; Pommeret, D.; Roques, L.",2020-04-22,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.17.20069179,1,Samuel Soubeyrand,INRAE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069179v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069179v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
14326,Quantifying the Risk of Indoor Drainage System in Multi-unit Apartment Building as a Transmission Route of SARS-CoV-2,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on human society. The isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from patients feces on human cell line raised concerns of possible transmission through human feces including exposure to aerosols generated by toilet flushing and through the indoor drainage system. Currently, routes of transmission, other than the close contact droplet transmission, are still not well understood. A quantitative microbial risk assessment was conducted to estimate the health risks associated with two aerosol exposure scenarios: 1) toilet flushing, and 2) faulty connection of a floor drain with the buildings main sewer pipe. SARS-CoV-2 data were collected from the emerging literature. The infectivity of the virus in feces was estimated based on a range of assumption between viral genome equivalence and infectious unit. The human exposure dose was calculated using Monte Carlo simulation of viral concentrations in aerosols under each scenario and human breathing rates. The probability of COVID-19 illness was generated using the dose-response model for SARS-CoV-1, a close relative of SARS-CoV-2, that was responsible for the SARS outbreak in 2003. The results indicate the median risks of developing COVID-19 for a single day exposure is 1.11 x 10-10 and 3.52 x 10-11 for toilet flushing and faulty drain scenario, respectively. The worst case scenario predicted the high end of COVID-19 risk for the toilet flushing scenario was 5.78 x 10-4 (at 95th percentile). The infectious viral loads in human feces are the most sensitive input parameter and contribute significantly to model uncertainty.","Shi, K.-W.; Huang, Y.-H.; Quon, H.; Ou-Yang, Z.-L.; Wang, C.; Jiang, S.",2020-09-02,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.29.20184093,1,Sunny Jiang,"University of California, Irvine",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.29.20184093v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.29.20184093v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143056
19599,"An emergency system for monitoring pulse oximetry, peak expiratory flow and body temperature of patients with COVID-19 at home: Development and preliminary application","BackgroundCOVID-19 is characterized by a rapid change in the patients condition, with major changes occurring over a few days. Our aim was to develop and evaluate an emergency system for monitoring patients with COVID-19, which may be useful in hospitals where more severe patients stay in their homes.

Methodology/Principal findingsThe system consists of the home-based patient unit, which is set up around the patient and the hospital unit, which enables the medical staff to telemonitor the patients condition and help to send medical recommendations. The home unit allows the data transmission from the patient to the hospital, which is performed using a cell phone application. The hospital unit includes a virtual instrument developed in LabVIEW(R) environment that is able to provide a real-time monitoring of the oxygen saturation (SpO2), beats per minute (BPM), body temperature (BT) and peak expiratory flow (PEF). Abnormal events may be fast and automatically identified. After the design details are described, the system is validated by a 30-day home monitoring study in 12 controls and 12 patients with COVID-19 presenting asymptomatic to mild disease. Patients presented reduced SpO2 (p<0.0001) and increased BPM values (p<0.0001). Three patients (25%) presented PEF values between 50 and 80% of the predicted. Three of the 12 monitored patients presented events of desaturation (SpO2<92%). The experimental results were in close agreement with the involved pathophysiology, providing clear evidences that the proposed system can be a useful tool for the remote monitoring of patients with COVID-19.

ConclusionsAn emergency system for home monitoring of patients with COVID-19 was developed in the current study. The proposed system allowed us to quickly respond to early abnormalities in these patients. This system may contribute to conserve hospital resources for those most in need, while simultaneously enabling early recognition of patients under acute deterioration, requiring urgent assessment.","Motta, L.

11460,"Two New Models for Epidemics with Application to the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States, Italy, and the United Kingdom","The Distributed Logistic Model and the Adaptive Logistic Model of epidemics are formulated and used to study the course of cases and deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. The distributed model is designed to account for a spread of initiation times of hot spots across a country; it does especially well at capturing the initial and linear phases of epidemics. The adaptive model accounts for the development of social mitigation factors, and does especially well at capturing the declining phases of epidemics. The historical data for the U.S., Italy, and the U.K. are analyzed in detail. The parameters of the fits to the two models provide complementary information about the pandemic. The initial infection rate constant was r0 [~=] 0.29 day-1 for each country, and the effective infection rate constants evolved with time in essentially the same way for each. This suggests that mitigation effects were equally effective in all three countries. Analysis with the distributed model suggests that it took somewhat different times T for the epidemic to spread across each country, with T (US)[~=] 50 days significantly greater than the T  s of Italy or the U.K. The mortality ratio in the U.S. was about 0.061 while in Italy and U.K. it was much larger at about 0.15.","Roberts, D.

We used databases from the Italian Ministry of Education containing the number of new positive SARS-CoV-2 cases per school from September 20 to November 8, 2020 to calculate incidence among students and staff. We calculated incidence across each age group using databases from the Veneto Region system of SARS-CoV-2 cases notification in the period August 26- November 24, 2020. We used a database from the Veneto Region system of SARS-CoV-2 secondary cases tracing in Verona province schools to estimate number of tests, the frequency of secondary infections at school by type of index case and the ratio positive cases/ number of tests per school institute using an adjusted multivariable generalized linear regression model. We estimated the reproduction number Rt at the regional level from the Italian Civil Protection of regional SARS-CoV-2 cases notification database in the period 6 August-2 December 2020.

FindingsFrom September 12 to November 7 2020, SARS-CoV-2 incidence among students was lower than that in the general population of all but two Italian regions. Secondary infections were <1%, and clusters of >2 secondary cases per school were 5-7% in a representative November week. Incidence among teachers was greater than in the general population. However, when compared with incidence among similar age groups, the difference was not significant (P=0.23). Secondary infections among teachers were more frequent when the index case was a teacher than a student (38% vs. 11%, P=0.007). From August 28 to October 25 in Veneto where school reopened on September 14, the growth of SARS-CoV- 2 incidence was lower in school age individuals, maximal in 20-29 and 45-49 years old individuals. The delay between the different school opening dates in the different Italian regions and the increase in the regional Covid19 reproduction number Rt was not uniform. Reciprocally, school closures in two regions where they were implemented before other measures did not affect the rate of Rt decline.

InterpretationOur analysis does not support a role for school opening as a driver of the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in Italy, a large European country with high SARS-CoV-2 incidence.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe role of schools and at large of children as amplifiers of the Covid19 pandemics is debated. Despite biological and epidemiological evidence that children play a marginal role in Sars-CoV-2 spread, policies of school closures have been predicated, mostly based on the temporal coincidence between school reopening in certain countries and Covid19 outbreaks. Whether schools contributed to the so called """"second wave"""" of Covid19 is uncertain. Italys regionalized calendar of school reopening and databases of positivity at school allows to estimate the impact of schools on the increase of Sars-CoV-2 that occurred in autumn 2020.

Added value of this studyWe found that incidence among students is lower than in the general population and that whereas incidence among teachers appears higher than that in the general population, it is comparable to that among individuals of the same age bracket. Moreover, secondary infections at school are rare and clusters even less common. The index case of a secondary teacher case is more frequently a teacher than a student. In Veneto, during the first phase of the second wave incidence among school age individuals was low as opposed to the sustained incidence among individuals of 45-49 years. Finally, the time lag between school opening and Rt increase was not uniform across different Italian regions with different school opening dates, with lag times shorter in regions where schools opened later.

Implications of the available evidenceThese findings contribute to indicate that Covid19 infections rarely occur at school and that transmission from students to teachers is very rare. Moreover, they fail to support a role for school age individuals and school openings as a driver of the Covid19 second wave. Overall, our findings could help inform policy initiatives of school openings during the current Covid19 pandemic.","Gandini, S.; Rainisio, M.; Iannuzzo, M.

23082,"Ethnicity and COVID-19 outcomes among healthcare workers in the United Kingdom: UK-REACH ethico-legal research, qualitative research on healthcare workers' experiences, and stakeholder engagement protocol","IntroductionAs the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, emerging evidence suggests that individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds may be disproportionately affected. The UK-REACH project has been initiated to understand ethnic differentials in COVID-19 outcomes among healthcare workers (HCWs) in the United Kingdom (UK) through five inter-linked work packages. The ethico-legal work package (Work Package 3) aims to understand and address legal, ethical and acceptability issues around big data research; the healthcare workers experiences work package (Work Package 4) is a qualitative study exploring healthcare workers experiences during COVID-19 and; the stakeholder engagement work package (Work Package 5) aims to provide feedback and support with the formulation and dissemination of the project recommendations.

Methods and AnalysisWork Package 3 has two different research strands: (a) desk-based doctrinal research; and (b) empirical qualitative research with key opinion leaders. For the empirical research, in-depth interviews will be conducted digitally and recorded with participants permission. Recordings will be transcribed, coded and analysed using thematic analysis. In Work Package 4, online in-depth interviews and focus groups will be conducted with approximately 150 HCWs, from across the UK, and these will be recorded with participants consent. The recordings will be transcribed, coded and data will be analysed using thematic analysis. Work Package 5 will achieve its objectives through regular group meetings and in-group discussions.

Ethics and DisseminationEthical approval has been received from the London - Brighton & Sussex Research Ethics Committee of the Health Research Authority (Ref No. 20/HRA/4718). Results of the study will be published in open access journals, and disseminated through conference presentations, project website, stakeholder organisations, media and scientific advisory groups.

Registration DetailsRegistered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry (ISRCTN11811602).

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDYO_LIThe dual approach of doctrinal and empirical research (Work Package 3) on the use of personal data by UK-REACH will give a comprehensive understanding of the ethical and legal implications of the study, and perceptions about its use of data.
C_LIO_LIQualitative research with healthcare workers in the UK on their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic (Work Package 4) will provide insight into personal behaviour, perceptions of risk and coping mechanisms adopted both inside and outside of the work environment.
C_LIO_LIStakeholder engagement (Work Package 5) from professional regulatory bodies and staff groups is embedded within the UK-REACH study to provide feedback on project activities and support with project recommendations.
C_LIO_LIThe target participants (key opinion leaders) for Work Package 3 empirical study will likely come from predominantly White backgrounds which may limit the breadth of views obtained in interviews. This limitation will be mitigated by active recruitment of opinion leaders from a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds and active interaction with Work Package 5.
C_LIO_LIDue to the pandemic restrictions, interviews and focus group discussions will be conducted via online methods as a substitute for face-to-face meetings, posing practical and technological challenges for dynamic interaction with participants.

19339,Features and outcomes of secondary sepsis and urinary tract infections in COVID-19 patients treated with stem cell nebulization,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is the defining global crisis of our time. Secondary complication such as urinary tract infections and sepsis, worsen the already established problem, creating a new challenge.

ObjectiveTo characterize the features and outcomes in COVID-19 patients with sepsis and urinary tract infection.

MethodsAn observational and analytical study was conducted within the framework of the SENTAD COVID clinical trial at the Abu Dhabi Stem Cells Center, were the patients received a nebulization therapy with the use of autologous stem cells (group A). Those patients were compared with a not stem cells treated control arm (group B), and both received the UAE COVID 19 standard management. An analysis of the culture samples, antimicrobial agents and the efficacy of the therapy on patients outcomes was done.

ResultsA significant difference between the groups was found in the UTI incidence (p=*0.0206). Patients in group A showed a lower tendency to sepsis in comparison with group B (7% vs 21%), HR=0.35, (95% Confidence Interval: 0.13 - 0.91), p=0.0175. It was calculated a NNT=7.3. Candida albicans was the most frequently agent causing sepsis and UTI. The massive use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials was striking.

ConclusionsWe found a protective factor of stem cells against secondary infection in COVID 19 cases, in terms of sepsis and UTI. The suggested immunomodulatory effect of stem cells offers a therapeutic strategy to manage the disease and avoid several complications. Antimicrobial agents can lead to increased opportunistic infections, so a rational approach to these treatments must be considered.","Torres Zambrano, G. M.; Rivero, R.

15111,Comorbidities and Susceptibility to COVID-19: A Generalized Gene Set Meta-Analysis Approach,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to over 820,000 deaths for almost 24 million confirmed cases worldwide, as of August 27th, 2020, per WHO report. Risk factors include pre-existing conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and cancer. There are currently no effective treatments. Our objective was to complete a meta-analysis to identify comorbidity-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), potentially conferring increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection using a computational approach.

ResultsSNP datasets were downloaded from publicly available GWAS catalog for 141 of 258 candidate COVID-19 comorbidities. Gene-level SNP analysis was performed to identify significant pathways by using MAGMA program. SNP annotation program was used to analyze MAGMA-identified genes. COVID-19 comorbidities from six disease categories were found to have significant associated pathways, which were validated by Q-Q plots (p<0.05). The top 250 human mRNA gene expressions for SNP-affected pathways, extracted from publicly accessible gene expression profiles, were evaluated for significant pathways. Protein-protein interactions of identified differentially expressed genes, visualized with STRING program, were significant (p<0.05). Gene interaction networks were found to be relevant to SARS and influenza pathogenesis.

ConclusionPathways potentially affected by or affecting SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified in underlying medical conditions likely to confer susceptibility and/or severity to COVID-19. Our findings have implications in COVID-19 treatment development.","Beckman, M. F.; Igba, C. K.; Mougeot, F.

18154,The Use of Saliva as a Diagnostic Specimen for SARS CoV-2 Molecular Diagnostic Testing for Pediatric Patients,"BackgroundChildren are an important population to test for COVID-19 infection, particularly because they may shed the virus without displaying symptoms. Testing children for COVID-19 via sensitive molecular methods is important, although collecting nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens can be challenging. A less invasive mode of specimen collection that yields test results comparable to those from NP specimens would be beneficial to simplify sample collection.

MethodsTo demonstrate that saliva is a suitable specimen for collection from children, the clinical usability/acceptability and the analytic performance of saliva were compared to NP specimens suspended in viral transport medium. Four different FDA EUA-approved real-time RT-PCR assays and one EUA approved saliva collection device were investigated.

ResultsThe study population included 526 patients between the ages of 3 and 61 years, 461 (88%) were <18 years, 425 were asymptomatic (81.1%), 92 were symptomatic (17.6%). Saliva mixed with saliva stabilizing buffer was found to yield comparable sensitivity to NP specimens when tested on the AllPlex SARS-CoV-2 molecular test (Seegene Inc). The analytic sensitivity of the AllPlex assay during testing of spiked saliva mixed with SpectrumDNA saliva stabilizer was found to be 250 genomic copies/mL.

ConclusionsOf the four FDA EUA-approved SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays studied, we found the AllPlex assay to be best suited for testing saliva specimens collected from children 5 years of age or older. The sensitivity of viral detection was equivalent to NP specimens when saliva specimens were mixed with the saliva stabilizer.","Delaney, M.; Thomas, B.; Ralph, C.

2590,Impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China,"This paper examines the role of various socioeconomic factors in mediating the local and cross-city transmissions of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) in China. We implement a machine learning approach to select instrumental variables that strongly predict virus transmission among the rich exogenous weather characteristics. Our 2SLS estimates show that the stringent quarantine, massive lockdown and other public health measures imposed in late January significantly reduced the transmission rate of COVID-19. By early February, the virus spread had been contained. While many socioeconomic factors mediate the virus spread, a robust government response since late January played a determinant role in the containment of the virus. We also demonstrate that the actual population flow from the outbreak source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. The results have rich implications for ongoing global efforts in containment of COVID-19.","Qiu, Y.; Chen, X.; Shi, W.",2020-03-17,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.13.20035238,1,Wei Shi,Jinan University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035238v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035238v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1007/s00148-020-00778-2

21271,Prevalent comorbidities among young and underprivileged: Death portrait of COVID-19 among 235 555 hospitalized patients in Brazil,"BackgroundCOVID-19 has been alarmingly spreading worldwide, with Brazil ranking third in total number of cases and second in deaths. Being a continental country, which comprises many ethnic groups and an engrained social inequality, the pandemic evidenced this heterogeneous discrepancy. We aimed to estimate the impact of associated risk factors, isolated or combined, on COVID-19 severeness, detecting specific epidemiological profiles for multiple age ranges in hospitalized Brazilians.

MethodsIn this large retrospective cohort study, we used open-access data from the Ministry of Health of Brazil with COVID-19 confirmed hospitalized patients annotated in SRAG system between February and August 2020, a total of 235555 entries. The association of COVID-19 death with socio-demographic and clinical characteristics was analysed and presented as odds ratios adjusted by confounding co-variables. We also presented marginal mean aOR values for high-order interactions either by or not another fixed level or condition. We kept all other variables in the multivariate logistic models in their mean values or equal proportions.

FindingsYounger individuals with one or more comorbidities had an adjusted odds ratio up to four-fold compared to those without it, in the same age interval. Younger diabetic patients either self-declared as brown ethnicity (aOR 5{middle dot}58, 95% CI 4{middle dot}97-6{middle dot}25; p<0{middle dot}0001) or with some other associated comorbidities, mainly chronic hematologic disease (21{middle dot}09, 13{middle dot}64-32{middle dot}6; p<0{middle dot}0001) and obesity (aOR 21{middle dot}7, 95% CI not calculated; p<0{middle dot}0001), resulted in outstanding death risk. Age over 60, particularly over 90 (28{middle dot}91, 24{middle dot}5-34{middle dot}11; p<0.001), usage of invasive ventilatory support (16{middle dot}23, 14{middle dot}05-18{middle dot}75; p<0{middle dot}001), admission to intensive care units (3{middle dot}14, 2{middle dot}82-3{middle dot}48; p<0{middle dot}001), multiple respiratory symptoms (3{middle dot}24, 2{middle dot}79-3{middle dot}75; p<0{middle dot}0001), black ethnicity (1{middle dot}78, 1{middle dot}52-2{middle dot}07; p<0{middle dot}05), and diagnosis previous to hospitalization (1{middle dot}32, 1{middle dot}19-1{middle dot}47; p<0{middle dot}05) were associated with higher death odds. As protective factors, with roughly one third less death risk, we found hospitalization duration of (4, 7] days and illness onset to hospitalization over 6 days.

InterpretationWe found evidence for increased COVID-19 risk in two distinct groups: younger patients with prevalent comorbidities, especially in brown ethnicity, and patients with black ethnicity. We speculate that the pro-inflammatory synergism of COVID-19 and comorbidities, promoting an overproduction of cytokines, is partially the cause of higher mortality in this young group. Brazilian black and brown are underprivileged populations, with structural social inequality, limited healthcare access and, thus, remarkable disease vulnerability. Our study supplies essential data to patient stratification upon admission, optimizing hospital management, and to guide public policy determinations, including group prioritization for COVID-19 vaccination in Brazil.

O_TEXTBOXResearch in context

Evidence before this studyCOVID-19 is still very active, having spread to over two hundred countries and caused more than one million deaths worldwide. Its current situation requires large-scale studies to assess the impact of preexisting comorbidities, symptoms, and socioeconomic issues regarding mortality rate, especially where lack of control is evident. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv on Dec 12, 2020, for studies published in English or Brazilian Portuguese, estimating the impact of several risk factors in COVID-19 prognosis. We used the search terms """"Brazil"""" or """"risk factors"""" or """"ethnicity"""" or """"cohort"""" or """"diabetes mellitus"""" or """"mortality"""" or """"symptoms"""" or """"comorbidities"""", and related synonyms, combined with """"SARS-CoV-2"""" or """"COVID-19"""". Many pre-existing conditions have shown to directly impact patient prognosis, out of which cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes, among others, are well established in SARS-CoV-2 infection severeness. Some studies reported an increased death risk for non-white Brazilians, but no large scale cohort analyzing the impact of one or more associated risk factors in younger Brazilians patients were found.

Added value of this studyWe found that the impact of having one or two or more risk factors on mortality are progressively higher in ages (60, 80], (40, 60], (20, 40], and (0, 20], compared with people of the same age interval without comorbidities. We also found that young brown individuals with diabetes, as well as black ethnicity on its own, are population subgroups at remarkably higher risk for severe COVID-19 in Brazil. Furthermore, advanced age, usage of ventilatory support, admission to intensive care units, multiple respiratory symptoms, and diagnosis previous to hospitalization were associated with higher death odds. As protective factors, we found hospitalization duration of (4, 7] days and illness onset to hospitalization over 6 days.

Implications of all the available evidenceWe identified multiple epidemiological profiles associated with death risk in different age ranges in Brazilian COVID-19 hospitalized patients. These findings unveil that a large part of Brazilian working-age population is at a higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 death, a neglected situation that is further exacerbating inequalities, leading to a striking sociodemographic and economic impact. We hope that our analysis aids patient risk stratification, hospital management optimization, and public policy determination, including prioritization for COVID-19 vaccination in Brazil.

6278,"A new role for Biofoundries in rapid prototyping, development, and validation of automated clinical diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown how the rapid rise in demand for patient and community sample testing, required for tracing and containing a highly infectious disease, has quickly overwhelmed testing capability globally. With most diagnostic infrastructure dependent on specialised instruments, their exclusive reagent supplies quickly become bottlenecks in times of peak demand, creating an urgent need for novel approaches to boost testing capacity. We address this challenge by refocusing the full synthetic biology stack available at the London Biofoundry onto the development of alternative patient sample testing pipelines. We present a reagent-agnostic automated SARS-CoV-2 testing platform that can be quickly deployed and scaled, and that accepts a diverse range of reagents. Using an in-house-generated, open-source, MS2-virus-like-particle-SARS-CoV-2 standard, we validate RNA extraction and RT-qPCR workflows as well as two novel detection assays based on CRISPR-Cas and Loop-mediated isothermal Amplification (LAMP) approaches. In collaboration with an NHS diagnostic testing lab, we report the performance of the overall workflow and benchmark SARS-CoV-2 detection in patient samples via RT-qPCR, CRISPR-Cas, and LAMP against clinical test sets. The validated RNA extraction and RT-qPCR platform has been installed in NHS diagnostic labs with a testing capacity of 1000 samples per day and now contributes to increased patient sample processing in the UK while we continue to refine and develop novel high-throughput diagnostic methods. Finally, our workflows and protocols can be quickly implemented and adapted by members of the Global Biofoundry Alliance and the wider scientific and medical diagnostics community.","Crone, M.

14110,Exposure and risk factors for COVID-19 and the impact of staying home on Michigan residents,"COVID-19 has had a substantial impact on clinical care and lifestyles globally. The State of Michigan reports over 80,000 positive COVID-19 tests between March 1, 2020 and July 29, 2020. We surveyed 8,047 Michigan Medicine biorepository participants in late June 2020. We found that 58% of COVID-19 cases reported no known exposure to family members or to someone outside the house diagnosed with COVID-19. A significantly higher rate of COVID-19 cases were employed as essential workers (45% vs 19%, p=3x10-11). COVID-19 cases reporting a fever were more likely to require hospitalization (categorized as severe; OR = 4.6 [95% CI: 1.7-13.0, p=0.004]) whereas respondents reporting rhinorrhea was less likely to require hospitalization (categorized as mild-to-moderate; OR = 0.16 [95% CI: 0.04-0.70, p=0.016]). African-Americans reported higher rates of being diagnosed with COVID-19 (OR = 4.0 [95% CI: 2.2-7.2, p=1x10-4]), as well as higher rates of exposure to family or someone outside the household diagnosed with COVID-19, an annual household income < $40,000, living in rental housing, and chronic diseases. During the Executive Order in Michigan, African Americans, women, and the lowest income group reported worsening health behaviors and higher overall concern for the potential detrimental effects of the pandemic. The higher risk of contracting COVID-19 observed among African Americans may be due to the increased rates of working as essential employees, lower socioeconomic status, and exposure to known positive cases. Continued efforts should focus on COVID-19 prevention and mitigation strategies, as well as address the inequality gaps that result in higher risks for both short-term and long-term health outcomes.","Wu, K.-H.

11796,Changes in SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Responses Impact the Estimates of Infections in Population-Based Seroprevalence Studies,"We have determined SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in a cohort of 96 individuals with acute infection and in 578 individuals enrolled in a seroprevalence population study in Switzerland including three groups, i.e. subjects with previous RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (n=90),  positive patient contacts (n=177) and  random selected subjects (n=311). SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses specific to the Spike (S), in the monomeric and native trimeric forms, and/or the nucleocapsid (N) proteins were equally sensitive in the acute infection phase. Interestingly, as compared to anti-S antibody responses, those against the N protein appear to wane in the post-infection and substantially underestimated the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the groups of  patient positive contacts, i.e. 10.9 to 32.2% reduction and in the  random selected general population, i.e. up to 45% reduction. The overall reduction in seroprevalence targeting only anti-N IgG antibodies for the total cohort ranged from 9.4 to 31%. Of note, the use of the S protein in its native trimer form was more sensitive as compared to monomeric S proteins.

3129,Global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2: from outbreak to pandemic,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is straining health systems around the world. Although the Chinese government implemented a number of severe restrictions on peoples movement in an attempt to contain its local and international spread, the virus had already reached many areas of the world in part due to its potent transmissibility and the fact that a substantial fraction of infected individuals develop little or no symptoms at all. Following its emergence, the virus started to generate sustained transmission in neighboring countries in Asia, Western Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States, and finally in South America and Africa. As the virus continues its global spread, a clear and evidence-based understanding of properties and dynamics of the global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to design and put in place efficient and globally coordinated interventions.

MethodsWe employ molecular surveillance data of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics for inference and comprehensive analysis of its global transmission network before the pandemic declaration. Our goal was to characterize the spatial-temporal transmission pathways that led to the establishment of the pandemic. We exploited a network-based approach specifically tailored to emerging outbreak settings. Specifically, it traces the accumulation of mutations in viral genomic variants via mutation trees, which are then used to infer transmission networks, revealing an up-to-date picture of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 between and within countries and geographic regions.

Results and ConclusionsThe analysis suggest multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the majority of world regions by means of heterogeneous transmission pathways. The transmission network is scale-free, with a few genomic variants responsible for the majority of possible transmissions. The network structure is in line with the available temporal information represented by sample collection times and suggest the expected sampling time difference of few days between potential transmission pairs. The inferred network structural properties, transmission clusters and pathways and virus introduction routes emphasize the extent of the global epidemiological linkage and demonstrate the importance of internationally coordinated public health measures.","Skums, P.; Kirpich, A.; Icer Baykal, P.; Zelikovsky, A.; Chowell, G.",2020-03-27,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.22.20041145,1,Pavel Skums,Georgia State University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041145v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041145v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
12730,Impact of tocilizumab administration on mortality in severe COVID-19,"PurposeThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide pandemic has placed a significant burden on hospitals and healthcare providers. The immune response to this disease is thought to lead to a cytokine storm, which contributes to the severity of illness. There is an urgent need to confirm whether the use of tocilizumab provides a benefit in individuals with COVID-19.

MethodsA single-center propensity-score matched cohort study, including all consecutive COVID-19 patients, admitted to the medical center who were either discharged from the medical center or expired between March 1, 2020, and May 5, 2020, was performed. Patients were stratified according to the receipt of tocilizumab for cytokine storm and matched to controls using propensity scores. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.

ResultsA total of 132 patients were included in the matched dataset (tocilizumab=66; no tocilizumab=66). Approximately 73% of the patients were male. Hypertension (55%), diabetes mellitus (31%), and chronic pulmonary disease (15%) were the most common comorbidities present. There were 18 deaths (27.3%) in the tocilizumab group and 18 deaths (27.3%) in the no tocilizumab group (odds ratio, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.465 - 2.151; p=1.00). Advanced age, history of myocardial infarction, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, heart failure, and malignancy were significantly more common in patients who died.

ConclusionThe current analysis does not support the use of tocilizumab for the management of cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19. Use of this therapeutic agent should be limited to the context of a clinical trial until more evidence is available.","Tsai, A.; Diawara, O.; Nahass, R.

19356,Indicators of past COVID-19 infection status: Findings from a large occupational cohort of staff and postgraduate research students from a UK university,"Background Definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 requires resources frequently restricted to the severely ill. Cohort studies must rely on surrogate indicators to define cases of COVID-19 in the community. We describe the prevalence and overlap of potential indicators including self-reported symptoms, suspicion, and routine test results, plus home antibody testing. Methods An occupational cohort of 2807 staff and postgraduate students at a large London university. Repeated surveys covering March to June 2020. Antibody test results from 'lateral flow' IgG/IgM cassettes in June 2020. Results 1882 participants had valid antibody test results, and 124 (7%) were positive. Core symptoms of COVID-19 were common (770 participants positive, 41%), although fewer met criteria on a symptom algorithm (n=297, 16%). Suspicion of COVID-19 (n=509, 27%) was much higher than positive external tests (n=39, 2%). Positive antibody tests were rare in people who had no suspicion (n=4, 1%) or no core symptoms (n=10, 2%). In those who reported external antibody tests, 15% were positive on the study antibody test, compared with 24% on earlier external antibody tests. Discussion Our results demonstrate the agreement between different COVID indicators. Antibody testing using lateral flow devices at home can detect asymptomatic cases and provide greater certainty to self-report; but due to weak and waning antibody responses to mild infection, may under-ascertain. Multiple indicators used in combination can provide a more complete story than one used alone. Cohort studies need to consider how they deal with different, sometimes conflicting, indicators of COVID-19 illness to understand its long-term outcomes.","Davis, K. A.

13693,"Accurately Differentiating COVID-19, Other Viral Infection, and Healthy Individuals Using Multimodal Features via Late Fusion Learning","Effectively identifying COVID-19 patients using non-PCR clinical data is critical for the optimal clinical outcomes. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of various biomedical features and appropriate technical approaches to accurately detecting COVID-19 patients. In this study, we recruited 214 confirmed COVID-19 patients in non-severe (NS) and 148 in severe (S) clinical type, 198 non-infected healthy (H) participants and 129 non-COVID viral pneumonia (V) patients. The participants clinical information (23 features), lab testing results (10 features), and thoracic CT scans upon admission were acquired as three input feature modalities. To enable late fusion of multimodality data, we developed a deep learning model to extract a 10-feature high-level representation of the CT scans. Exploratory analyses showed substantial differences of all features among the four classes. Three machine learning models (k-nearest neighbor kNN, random forest RF, and support vector machine SVM) were developed based on the 43 features combined from all three modalities to differentiate four classes (NS, S, V, and H) at once. All three models had high accuracy to differentiate the overall four classes (95.4%-97.7%) and each individual class (90.6%-99.9%). Multimodal features provided substantial performance gain from using any single feature modality. Compared to existing binary classification benchmarks often focusing on single feature modality, this study provided a novel and effective breakthrough for clinical applications. Findings and the analytical workflow can be used as clinical decision support for current COVID-19 and other clinical applications with high-dimensional multimodal biomedical features.

One sentence summaryWe trained and validated late fusion deep learning-machine learning models to predict non-severe COVID-19, severe COVID-19, non-COVID viral infection, and healthy classes from clinical, lab testing, and CT scan features extracted from convolutional neural network and achieved predictive accuracy of > 96% to differentiate all four classes at once based on a large dataset of 689 participants.","Xu, M.; Ouyang, L.; Gao, Y.; Chen, Y.; Yu, T.; Li, Q.; Sun, K.; Bao, F.

5894,Modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for COVID-19: results from UK Biobank,"BackgroundInformation on risk factors for COVID-19 is sub-optimal. We investigated demographic, lifestyle, socioeconomic, and clinical risk factors, and compared them to risk factors for pneumonia and influenza in UK Biobank.

MethodsUK Biobank recruited 37-70 year olds in 2006-2010 from the general population. The outcome of confirmed COVID-19 infection (positive SARS-CoV-2 test) was linked to baseline UK Biobank data. Incident influenza and pneumonia were obtained from primary care data. Poisson regression was used to study the association of exposure variables with outcomes.

FindingsAmong 428,225 participants, 340 had confirmed COVID-19. After multivariable adjustment, modifiable risk factors were higher body mass index (RR 1.24 per SD increase), smoking (RR 1.38), slow walking pace as a proxy for physical fitness (RR 1.66) and use of blood pressure medications as a proxy for hypertension (RR 1.40). Non-modifiable risk factors included older age (RR 1.10 per 5 years), male sex (RR 1.64), black ethnicity (RR 1.86), socioeconomic deprivation (RR 1.26 per SD increase in Townsend Index), longstanding illness (RR 1.38) and high cystatin C (RR 1.24 per 1 SD increase). The risk factors overlapped with pneumonia somewhat; less so for influenza. The associations with modifiable risk factors were generally stronger for COVID-19, than pneumonia or influenza.

InterpretationThese findings suggest that modification of lifestyle may help to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and could be a useful adjunct to other interventions, such as social distancing and shielding of high risk.

18397,Delayed Stroke Treatment during COVID-19 Pandemic in China,"BackgroundSocial distance, quarantine, pathogen testing and other preventive strategies implemented during COVID-19 pandemic may negatively influence the management of acute stroke.

ObjectiveThe current study aimed to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on treatment delay of acute stroke in China.

MethodsThis study included patients with acute stroke admitted in two hospitals in Jiangsu, China. Patients admitted before and after the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak (January 31, 2020, as officially announced by Chinese government) were compared for pre- (measured as onset-to-door time) and post-hospital delay (measured as door-to-needle time). The influence factors for delayed treatment (indicated as onset-to-needle time >4.5 hours) were analyzed with multivariate logistic regression analysis.

ResultsOnset-to-door time increased from 202 min (IQR 65-492) before to 317 min (IQR 75-790) after the COVID-19 pandemic (P=0.001). Door-to-needle time increased from 50min (IQR 40-75) before to 65 min (IQR 48-84) after the COVID-19 pandemic (P=0.048). The proportion of patients with intravenous thrombolysis in those with acute ischemic stroke was decreased significantly after the pandemic (15.4% vs 20.1%; P=0.030). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that patients after COVID-19 pandemic, lower educational level, rural residency, mild symptoms and transported by other means than ambulance were associated with delayed treatment.

ConclusionsCOVID-19 pandemic has remarkable impacts on the management of acute ischemic stroke. Both pre- and post-hospital delays were prolonged significantly, and proportion of patient arrived within the 4.5-hour time window for intravenous thrombolysis treatment was decreased. Given that anti-COVID-19 measures are becoming medical routines, efforts are warranted to shorten the delay so that the outcomes of stroke could be improved.","Xu, G.; Gu, S.",2020-11-18,Neurology,10.1101/2020.11.17.20228122,1,Gelin Xu,Jinling Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.17.20228122v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.17.20228122v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
20275,Acceptable Performance of the Abbott ID NOW Among Symptomatic Individuals with Confirmed COVID-19,"INTRODUCTIONPoint of care diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, such as the ID NOW, have great potential to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The ID NOW is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic individuals within the first 7 days of symptom onset for COVID-19 if tested within 1 hour of specimen collection. However, clinical data on the performance of the ID NOW is limited, with many studies deviating from the manufacturers instructions and/or having small sample size.

METHODSAdults with COVID-19 in the community or hospital were recruited into the study. Paired throat swabs were collected, with one throat swab transported immediately in an empty sterile tube to the laboratory for ID NOW testing, and the other transported in universal transport media and tested by an in-house SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay targeting the E-gene. Positive percent agreement (PPA) was calculated.

RESULTS133 individuals were included in the study. 129 samples were positive on either the ID NOW and/or RT-PCR. Assuming any positive result on either assay represents a true positive, PPA of the ID NOW compared to RT-PCR with 95% confidence intervals was 89.1% [82.0% - 94.1%] and 91.6% [85.1% - 95.9%], respectively. When analyzing individuals with symptoms [&le;] 7 days and who had the ID NOW performed within an hour, ID NOW PPA increased to 98.2%.

DISCUSSIONIn this study, SARS-CoV-2 results from the ID NOW were reliable, especially when testing was adhered to manufacturers recommendations.","Stokes, W.; Berenger, B.; Singh, T.; Adeghe, I.; Schneider, A.; Portnoy, D.; King, T.; Scott, B.; Pabbaraju, K.; Shokoples, S.; Wong, A.

11695,Graduate students significantly more concerned than undergraduates about returning to campus in the era of COVID-19,"IntroductionAs students return to colleges and universities in the fall of 2020, it is important to understand their perception of risk and their desire for in person versus online learning, which may differ between undergraduate and graduate students.

MethodsWe anonymously surveyed 212 undergraduate and 134 graduate students in the College of Public Health, and 94 graduate students in the College of Education in late June, 2020. We asked them Likert style questions regarding their comfort returning to campus and their preferred learning strategies once back. We compared """"Strongly agree/Agree"""" with """"Neutral/Disagree/Strongly disagree"""" using a chi-square test.

ResultsGraduate students were significantly less likely to look forward to being on campus (38.3% doctoral vs 40.6% masters vs 77.7% undergraduate, p < 0.001), more likely to perceive themselves as high risk (43.3% doctoral vs 40.0% masters vs 17.5% undergraduate, p < 0.001), and were more likely to prefer all classwork online (66.7% doctoral vs 44.6% masters vs 20.8% undergraduate, p < 0.001). Graduate students were also less likely to prefer to be in the classroom as much as possible in the fall (59.2% doctoral vs 67.7% masters vs 74.5% undergraduate, p < 0.001). Most were not concerned about their ability to conduct research. Students generally supported wearing of facemasks indoors.

ConclusionsThere are important differences in perception of risk and desire for online versus in-person learning between undergraduate and graduate students.

21671,How best do we engage the general population in testing for COVID-19?,"The UK Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) emphasises the need for high levels of engagement with communities and individuals to ensure the effectiveness of any COVID-19 testing programme. A novel pilot health surveillance programme to assess the feasibility of weekly mass RT-LAMP testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus using saliva samples collected at home was developed and piloted by the University of Southampton and Southampton City Council. Rapid qualitative evaluation was conducted to explore experiences of those who took part in the programme, of those who declined and of those in the educational and healthcare organisations involved in the pilot testing who were responsible for roll-out. This included 77 interviews and 20 focus groups with 223 staff, students, pupils and household members from four schools, one university, and one community healthcare NHS trust. Conversations revealed that high levels of communication, trust and convenience were necessary to ensure peoples engagement with the programme. This suggests community leaders and stakeholder organisations should be involved throughout programme development and implementation to optimise these features of the testing.

24127,Femtomolar SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Detection Using the Microbubbling Digital Assay with Smartphone Readout Enables Antigen Burden Quantitation and Dynamics Tracking,"BackgroundLittle is known about the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 antigen burden in respiratory samples in different patient populations at different stages of infection. Current rapid antigen tests cannot quantitate and track antigen dynamics with high sensitivity and specificity in respiratory samples.

MethodsWe developed and validated an ultra-sensitive SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay with smartphone readout using the Microbubbling Digital Assay previously developed by our group, which is a platform that enables highly sensitive detection and quantitation of protein biomarkers. A computer vision-based algorithm was developed for microbubble smartphone image recognition and quantitation. A machine learning-based classifier was developed to classify the smartphone images based on detected microbubbles. Using this assay, we tracked antigen dynamics in serial swab samples from COVID patients hospitalized in ICU and immunocompromised COVID patients.

ResultsThe limit of detection (LOD) of the Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay was 0.5 pg/mL (10.6 fM) recombinant nucleocapsid (N) antigen or 4000 copies/mL inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus in nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, comparable to many rRT-PCR methods. The assay had high analytical specificity towards SARS-CoV-2. Compared to EUA-approved rRT-PCR methods, the Microbubbling Antigen Assay demonstrated a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 97% (95% confidence interval (CI), 92-99%) in symptomatic individuals within 7 days of symptom onset and positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid results, and a negative percent agreement (NPA) of 97% (95% CI, 94-100%) in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals with negative nucleic acid results. Antigen positivity rate in NP swabs gradually decreased as days-after-symptom-onset increased, despite persistent nucleic acid positivity of the same samples. The computer vision and machine learning-based automatic microbubble image classifier could accurately identify positives and negatives, based on microbubble counts and sizes. Total microbubble volume, a potential marker of antigen burden, correlated inversely with Ct values and days-after-symptom-onset. Antigen was detected for longer periods of time in immunocompromised patients with hematologic malignancies, compared to immunocompetent individuals. Simultaneous detectable antigens and nucleic acids may indicate the presence of replicating viruses in patients with persistent infections.

ConclusionsThe Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay enables sensitive and specific detection of acute infections, and quantitation and tracking of antigen dynamics in different patient populations at various stages of infection. With smartphone compatibility and automated image processing, the assay is well-positioned to be adapted for point-of-care diagnosis and to explore the clinical implications of antigen dynamics in future studies.","Chen, H.; Li, Z.; Feng, S.; Wang, A.; Richard-Greenblatt, M.; Hutson, E.; Andrianus, S.; Glaser, L.; Rodino, K.

3570,Rapid and accurate identification of COVID-19 infection through machine learning based on clinical available blood test results,"Since the sudden outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it has rapidly evolved into a momentous global health concern. Due to the lack of constructive information on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and specific treatment, it highlights the importance of early diagnosis and timely treatment. In this study, 11 key blood indices were extracted through random forest algorithm to build the final assistant discrimination tool from 49 clinical available blood test data which were derived by commercial blood test equipments. The method presented robust outcome to accurately identify COVID-19 from a variety of suspected patients with similar CT information or similar symptoms, with accuracy of 0.9795 and 0.9697 for the cross-validation set and test set, respectively. The tool also demonstrated its outstanding performance on an external validation set that was completely independent of the modeling process, with sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of 0.9512, 0.9697, and 0.9595, respectively. Besides, 24 samples from overseas infected patients with COVID-19 were used to make an in-depth clinical assessment with accuracy of 0.9167. After multiple verification, the reliability and repeatability of the tool has been fully evaluated, and it has the potential to develop into an emerging technology to identify COVID-19 and lower the burden of global public health. The proposed tool is well-suited to carry out preliminary assessment of suspected patients and help them to get timely treatment and quarantine suggestion.

7783,The Challenge of Using Epidemiological Case Count Data: The Example of Confirmed COVID-19 Cases and the Weather,"The publicly available data on COVID-19 cases provides an opportunity to better understand this new disease. However, strong attention needs to be paid to the limitations of the data to avoid making inaccurate conclusions. This article, which focuses on the relationship between the weather and COVID-19, raises the concern that the same factors influencing the spread of the disease might also affect the number of tests performed and who gets tested. For example, weather conditions impact the prevalence of respiratory diseases with symptoms similar to COVID-19, and this will likely influence the number of tests performed. This general limitation could severely undermine any similar analysis using existing COVID-19 data or similar epidemiological data, which could, therefore, mislead decision-makers on questions of great policy relevance.

In mathematical statistics, the tools to handle all of these phenomena exist; however, they are seldom used for epidemiological models. The goal of this paper is to start filling this gap by proposing a general stochastic epidemiological model, which we call SEIR Filter.

Technically our model is a heterogeneous partially observable vector autoregression model, in which we are able to express closed form formulas for the distribution of compartments and observations, so both maximum likelihood and least square estimators are analytically tractable. We give conditions for vanishing, explosion and stationary behaviour of the epidemic and we are able to express a closed form formula for reproduction number.

Finally, we present several examples of the models application. We construct an estimate age-cohort model of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Czech Republic. To demonstrate the strengths of the model, we employ it to analyse and compare three vaccination scenarios.","Smid, M.; Berec, L.; Kubena, A.

12920,SARS-CoV-2 antigens expressed in plants detect antibody responses in COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has swept the world and poses a significant global threat to lives and livelihoods, with over 16 million confirmed cases and at least 650 000 deaths from COVID-19 in the first 7 months of the pandemic. Developing tools to measure seroprevalence and understand protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is a priority. We aimed to develop a serological assay using plant-derived recombinant viral proteins, which represent important tools in less-resourced settings.

MethodsWe established an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the S1 and receptor-binding domain (RBD) portions of the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2, expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. We measured antibody responses in sera from South African patients (n=77) who had tested positive by PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Samples were taken a median of six weeks after the diagnosis, and the majority of participants had mild and moderate COVID-19 disease. In addition, we tested the reactivity of pre-pandemic plasma (n=58) and compared the performance of our in-house ELISA with a commercial assay. We also determined whether our assay could detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA in saliva.

ResultsWe demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins are readily detectable using recombinant plant-derived viral proteins, in patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. Reactivity to S1 and RBD was detected in 51 (66%) and 48 (62%) of participants, respectively. Notably, we detected 100% of samples identified as having S1-specific antibodies by a validated, high sensitivity commercial ELISA, and OD values were strongly and significantly correlated between the two assays. For the pre-pandemic plasma, 1/58 (1.7%) of samples were positive, indicating a high specificity for SARS-CoV-2 in our ELISA. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG correlated significantly with IgA and IgM responses. Endpoint titers of S1- and RBD-specific immunoglobulins ranged from 1:50 to 1:3200. S1-specific IgG and IgA were found in saliva samples from convalescent volunteers.

ConclusionsWe demonstrate that recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins produced in plants enable robust detection of SARS-CoV-2 humoral responses. This assay can be used for seroepidemiological studies and to measure the strength and durability of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in infected patients in our setting.","Makatsa, M. S.; Tincho, M.

22118,"COVID-19 infection and outcomes in a population-based cohort of 17,173 adults with intellectual disabilities compared with the general population","ObjectivesTo compare COVID-19 infection, severe infection, mortality, case-fatality, and excess deaths, among adults with intellectual disabilities and those without.

DesignRecord-linkage of all adults recorded with intellectual disabilities in Scotlands Census, 2011, and a 5% sample of other adults, to COVID-19 test results (Electronic Communication of Surveillance in Scotland), hospitalisations (Scottish Morbidity Record 01), and deaths (National Records of Scotland).

SettingGeneral population; 24th January 2020 - 15th August 2020

ParticipantsSuccessful linkage of 94.8% provided data on 17,173 adults with, and 195,859 without, intellectual disabilities.

OutcomesCrude rates of COVID-19 infection, severe infection (hospitalisation/death), mortality, and case fatality; age-, sex- and deprivation-standardised severe infection and mortality ratios; annual all-cause mortality for 2020 and 2015-2019.

ResultsAdults with intellectual disabilities had higher rates of COVID-19 infection (957/100,000 versus 513/100,000); severe infection (549/100,000 versus 237/100,000); mortality (259/100,000 versus 114/100,000); and case-fatality (30% versus 24%). Poorer COVID-19 outcomes remained after standardising for age, sex and deprivation: standardised severe infection ratio 2.59 (95% CI 1.80, 3.39) and mortality ratio 3.20 (95% CI 2.16, 4.25). These were higher among 55-64 year olds: 7.12 (95% CI 3.73, 10.50) and 16.16 (95% CI7.69, 24.63) respectively. Among adults with intellectual disabilities, all-cause mortality was only slightly higher in 2020 than the previous five years: standardised mortality ratios 2.49 (95% CI 2.17, 2.81) and 2.38 (95% CI 2.26, 2.49) respectively.

ConclusionsAdults with intellectual disabilities were more likely to be infected with COVID-19, and had worse outcomes once infected, particularly those under 65 years. Non-pharmaceutical interventions directed at formal and informal carers are essential to reduce transmission and all adults with intellectual disabilities should be immediately prioritised for vaccination regardless of age.

What this study addsO_LICompared with general population adults, adults with intellectual disabilities were almost twice as likely to become infected with COVID-19, 2.3 times as likely to have severe infection, 2.3 times as likely to have COVID-19 mortality, and had 25% higher COVID-19 case-fatality.
C_LIO_LIAfter standardising for age, sex and deprivation, people with intellectual disabilities were 3.2 times more at risk of covid-19 mortality and 2.6 times more at risk of severe infection relative to those with no intellectual disabilities
C_LIO_LICompared with general population adults, adults with intellectual disabilities had poorer outcomes among non-elderly age-groups particularly those aged 55-65 years, men, and those living in less-deprived neighbourhoods.
C_LIO_LINon-pharmaceutical initiatives are important for carers and care-provider organisations, and adults with intellectual disabilities should be prioritised in the national rollouts of COVID-19 vaccination programmes, regardless of age, sex, or neighbourhood deprivation.

11582,Prehospitalization Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) use and Clinical Outcomes in COVID-19,"Background and AimGastric acid has shown to neutralize many viruses. The working receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), which has shown to be omnipresent in the gastrointestinal tract. There is a theoretical concern that SARS-CoV-2 can escape the neutralization by gastric acid because of hypochlorhydria caused by the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and can predispose the patients for severe COVID-19.

MethodsWe studied the association between prehospitalization PPI use and clinical outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

ResultsIn our study, 15.6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were on PPIs at home. Mortality among PPI-users was 2.3 times higher than non-users, along with 2.5 times higher risk of mechanical ventilation. This relationship existed even after adjusting for confounding variables.

ConclusionThese results warrant further investigation in prospective studies to evaluate if PPI-induced hypochlorhydria is associated with worse outcomes, including mortality because of the omnipresence of ACE-2 in the gastrointestinal tract.","Ramachandran, P.; Perisetti, A.; Gajendran, M.; Jean-Louise, F.; Dwivedi, A.

In this research, we studied the trend, model Nigeria daily COVID-19 cases and forecast for the future occurrences in the country at large. We adopt the Box and Jenkins approach. The time plot showed that the cases of COVID-19 rises rapidly in recent time. KPSS test confirms the non-stationarity of the process (p < 0.05) before differencing. The test also confirmed the stationarity of the process (p > 0.05) after differencing. Various ARIMA (p,d,q) were examined with their respective AICs and Log-likelihood. ARIMA (1, 2, 1) was selected as the best model due to its least AIC (559.74) and highest log likelihood (-276.87). Both Shapiro-Wilk test and Box test performed confirm the fitness of the model (p > 0.05) for the series. Forecast for 30 days was then made for COVID-19 cases in Nigeria.

20179,Engineered CRISPR/Cas12a Enables Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Detection,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has swept through the globe at an unprecedented rate. CRISPR-based detection technologies such as DETECTR, SHERLOCK, and STOPCovid have emerged as a rapid and affordable platform that can shape the future of diagnostics. Recently, we reported engineered crRNAs for Cas12a, called ENHANCE, that enables enhanced detection of nucleic acids. Here we report development, clinical validation, and advancement of ENHANCE platform for detecting SARS-CoV-2. With an RT-LAMP pre-amplification step, ENHANCE detects samples down to a single copy with 95% accuracy and shows high specificity towards various isolates of SARS-CoV-2 against 31 highly similar and common respiratory pathogens. Utilizing LbCas12a-mediated trans-cleavage activity, ENHANCE works robustly in a wide range of magnesium concentration (3 mM-13 mM), allowing for further assay optimization. Additionally, ENHANCEv2 is developed to further improve the previously reported ENHANCE. ENHANCEv2 employs mutated LbCas12aD156R, engineered chimeric DNA-extended crRNA, and a dual reporter for both fluorescence-based reporter assay and lateral flow assay. Both ENHANCE and ENHANCEv2 are validated in 62 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs, showing 60/62 (96.7%) agreement with RT-qPCR results, and using only 5 L of sample and 20 minutes of CRISPR reaction. Lateral flow assay on paper strips displays 100% agreement with fluorescence-based reporter assay in the clinical validation. Following a 30-minute pre-amplification RT-LAMP step, the lyophilized ENHANCEv2 is shown to achieve high sensitivity and specificity while reducing CRISPR reaction time to as low as 3 minutes and maintaining its detection capability upon storage at room temperature for several weeks.","Nguyen, L.

7816,Time Dynamics of COVID-19,"We apply tools from functional data analysis to model cumulative trajectories of COVID-19 cases across countries, establishing a framework for quantifying and comparing cases and deaths across countries longitudinally. It emerges that a countrys trajectory during an initial first month """"priming period"""" largely determines how the situation unfolds subsequently. We also propose a method for forecasting case counts, which takes advantage of the common, latent information in the entire sample of curves, instead of just the history of a single country. Our framework facilitates to quantify the effects of demographic covariates and social mobility on doubling rates and case fatality rates through a time-varying regression model. Decreased workplace mobility is associated with lower doubling rates with a roughly two week delay, and case fatality rates exhibit a positive feedback pattern.","Carroll, C.; Bhattacharjee, S.; Chen, Y.; Dubey, P.; Fan, J.; Gajardo, A.; Zhou, X.; Mueller, H.-G.; Wang, J.-L.",2020-05-23,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.21.20109405,1,Hans-Georg Mueller,"University of California, Davis",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.20109405v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.20109405v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1038/s41598-020-77709-4
18098,Changing probability of experiencing food insecurity by socioeconomic and demographic groups during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK,"BackgroundFood supply concerns have featured prominently in the UK response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We assess changes in food insecurity in the UK population from April to July 2020.

MethodWe analyze 11,095 respondents from the April through July waves of the Understanding Society COVID-19 longitudinal study survey linked with Wave 9 of the UK Understanding Society study. Food insecurity was defined as having used a food bank in the last 4 weeks; being hungry but not eating in the last week; or not able to eat healthy and nutritious food in the last week. Unadjusted estimates to examine changes in population prevalence and logistic regression were used to assess the association between employment transitions and food insecurity.

FindingsThe prevalence of reporting at least one form of food insecurity rose from 7{middle dot}1% in April to 20{middle dot}2% by July 2020. Some of the largest increases were among Asian respondents (22{middle dot}91 percentage points), the self-employed (15{middle dot}90 percentage points), and 35-44-year-olds (17{middle dot}08 percentage points). In logistic regression models, those moving from employment to unemployment had higher odds of reporting food insecurity relative to furloughed individuals (OR = 2{middle dot}23; 95% CI: 1{middle dot}20-4{middle dot}131) and to the persistently employed (OR=2{middle dot}38; 95% CI: 1{middle dot}33-4{middle dot}27), adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Furloughed individuals did not differ significantly in their probability of experiencing food insecurity compared to the persistently employed (OR=1{middle dot}07; 95% CI: 0{middle dot}83 to 1{middle dot}37).

InterpretationFood insecurity has increased substantially in the UK. Steps are needed to provide subsidies or food support to vulnerable groups.

O_TEXTBOXEvidence before this studyWe searched Google Scholar with the terms """"COVID-19"""" and """"food insecurity"""" and """"UK""""; and """"food insecurity"""" and """"UK"""" and """"coronavirus"""", published between January 1st and October 31st, 2020. One cross-sectional report was identified, which found higher levels of food insecurity in early April 2020 relative to 2018. Importantly, the report relied on items used to measure food insecurity that referred to a 12-month time span in 2018 and then a 30-day time span in April 2020, a potential source of bias for examining changes in population prevalence over time.

Added value of this studyHere we provide the first longitudinal national probability study that tracks temporal changes in population prevalence of food insecurity several months following the initial COVID-19-related lockdown measures in the UK. The prevalence of food insecurity rose for all socioeconomic and demographic and groups from April to July 2020, but did so for some more than others. Some of the largest increases in food insecurity were among Asian respondents, the self-employed, respondents aged 35-44, and those living in Scotland, London, and the North West of England. At the individual level, losing employment was associated with a higher odds of food insecurity compared to those furloughed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and the persistently employed. Importantly, furloughed individuals did not differ in their probability of food insecurity relative to the persistently employed.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis study documents an alarming increase in food insecurity in the United Kingdom during the pandemic, with important implications for policy. While Coronavirus the Job Retention Scheme appeared to have conferred some protection, it is clear that not enough has been done to mitigate overall increases food insecurity in the UK. Steps are needed to provide subsidies or food support, especially since during the pandemic emergency food assistance may not be readily accessible. Taken together our results show that, while COVID is first of all a health crisis, it also has potential to become an escalating social and economic crisis if steps are not taken to protect the weak.

8657,Summer vacation and COVID-19: effects of metropolitan people going to summer provinces,"Many countries are now investigating what the effects of summer vacation might be on the COVID-19 pandemic. Here one particular such question is addressed: what will happen if large numbers of metropolitan people visit a less populated province during the summer vacation? By means of a simple epidemic model, allowing for both short and long-term visitors to the province, it is studied which features are most influential in determining if such summer movements will result in large number of infections among the province population. The method is applied to the island of Gotland off the South East coast of Sweden. It is shown that the amount of mixing between the metropolitan and province groups and the fraction of metropolitan people being infectious upon arrival are most influential. Consequently, minimizing events gathering both the province and metropolitan groups and/or reducing the number of short-term visitors could substantially decrease spreading, as could measures to lower the fraction initially infectious upon arrival.","Britton, T.; Ball, F.

14156,Genomic epidemiology of COVID-19 in care homes in the East of England,"COVID-19 poses a major challenge to care homes, as SARS-CoV-2 is readily transmitted and causes disproportionately severe disease in older people. Here, 1,167 residents from 337 care homes were identified from a dataset of 6,600 COVID-19 cases from the East of England. Older age and being a care home resident were associated with increased mortality. SARS-CoV-2 genomes were available for 700 residents from 292 care homes. By integrating genomic and temporal data, 409 viral clusters within the 292 homes were identified, indicating two different patterns - outbreaks among care home residents and independent introductions with limited onward transmission. Approximately 70% of residents in the genomic analysis were admitted to hospital during the study, providing extensive opportunities for transmission between care homes and hospitals. Limiting viral transmission within care homes should be a key target for infection control to reduce COVID-19 mortality in this population.

Impact statementSARS-CoV-2 can spread efficiently within care homes causing COVID-19 outbreaks among residents, who are at increased risk of severe disease, emphasising the importance of stringent infection control in this population.","Hamilton, W.

In the absence of any definite antiviral therapy except some benefit of remdesivir, there is an ongoing search for effective therapy. Famotidine has been shown to reduce mortality in hospitalized patients in a few studies. We conducted a systematic review on the use of famotidine in COVID-19. Methods: We searched the databases Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and Medrxiv. Title/abstract screening, full text screening and data abstraction were carried out in by two reviewers. Case series, cohort studies and randomized trials were included. Results: Five studies were eligible for inclusion: all were retrospective cohort or case series. Low quality evidence suggests a likely clinical benefit for the use of famotidine in decreasing mortality in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. A meta-analysis of two cohort studies showed a statistically significant decrease in the composite outcome for death and intubation with famotidine (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.73).

This toolbox is built upon a hierarchical epidemiological model in which two observed time series of daily proportions of infected and removed cases are emitted from the underlying infection dynamics governed by a Markov SIR infectious disease process. We extend the SIR model to incorporate various types of time-varying quarantine protocols, including government-level macro isolation policies and community-level micro inspection measures. We develop a calibration procedure for under-reported infected cases. This toolbox provides forecast, in both online and offline forms, of turning points of interest, including the time when daily infected proportion becomes smaller than the previous ones and the time when daily infected proportions becomes smaller than that of daily removed proportion, as well as the ending time of the epidemic. An R software is made available for the public, and examples on the use of this software are illustrated. Some possible extensions of our novel epidemiological models are discussed.","Song, P.

23610,Qualification of the UniBw protection concept in different rooms of the Obermenzinger high school,"Current research has shown that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via airborne particles. These particles are generated when infected persons exhale and they spread throughout the room, resulting in a high concentration and thus a high risk of infection of non-infected persons. One way to reduce the concentration of particles is to filter them using mobile room air cleaners, which can be easily set up and reduce the concentration of viruses or keep them at a low level. Since many studies are conducted in generic rooms, the question of the cleaning performance of such room air cleaners in real rooms arises. In order to investigate this, measurements of the effectiveness were carried out in a total of 4 different rooms of the """"Obermenzinger Gymnasium"""" (Obermenzinger high school) in Munich. It can be shown that good effects of the room air cleaners are achieved even under realistic conditions.

20530,Associations between Stress and Child Verbal Abuse and Corporal Punishment during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Potential Effect Modification by Lockdown Measures,"BackgroundChild abuse appears to be on the increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the extent that lockdown measures modified the association between stress and abuses has not been systematically assessed.

ObjectivesTo assess: 1) the association between caregivers stress and self-reported verbal abuse and corporal punishment of a child in the household, and; 2) modification of the stated association by experienced COVID-19 lockdown measures.

Participants and settingsCaregivers residing in villages on lockdown in the Deep South of Thailand (n=466 participants)

MethodsWe randomly sampled 12 villages in the study area, and 40 households per village. Trained enumerators who were residents of the sampled villages collected the data using phone-based interview. We measured stress level using the standard ST-5 questionnaire. We developed and pilot-tested questions for measurement of child abuse and lockdown experiences specifically for this study.

ResultsCaregivers with moderate and higher levels of stress were more likely than caregivers with low level of stress to report verbal abuse (48% vs. 23%, respectively; Adj. OR = 3.12, 95% CI = 1.89, 5.15) and corporal punishment (28% vs. 8%, respectively; Adj. OR = 2.76, 95% CI = 1.41, 5.42). We found that COVID-19 lockdown experiences modified the associations between stress and verbal abuse and corporal punishment.

ConclusionThere were associations between stress and abuses, which were modified by lockdown experiences. However, social desirability, lack of details in the answers, and potential confounding by mental illness co-morbidities were notable limitations of the study. Caveat is advised in the interpretation of the study findings.","Jeharsae, R.; Jae-Noh, M.; Jae-A-Lee, H.; Waeteh, S.; Nimu, N.; Chewae, C.; Yama, M.; Dureh, N.; Wichaidit, W.",2021-01-06,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.01.05.20248973,1,Wit Wichaidit,"Epidemiology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University.

3789,Repurposing Therapeutics for COVID-19: Rapid Prediction of Commercially available drugs through Machine Learning and Docking,"BackgroundThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread rapidly around the globe during the past 3 months. As the virus infected cases and mortality rate of this disease is increasing exponentially, scientists and researchers all over the world are relentlessly working to understand this new virus along with possible treatment regimens by discovering active therapeutic agents and vaccines. So, there is an urgent requirement of new and effective medications that can treat the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Methods and findingsWe perform the study of drugs that are already available in the market and being used for other diseases to accelerate clinical recovery, in other words repurposing of existing drugs. The vast complexity in drug design and protocols regarding clinical trials often prohibit developing various new drug combinations for this epidemic disease in a limited time. Recently, remarkable improvements in computational power coupled with advancements in Machine Learning (ML) technology have been utilized to revolutionize the drug development process. Consequently, a detailed study using ML for the repurposing of therapeutic agents is urgently required. Here, we report the ML model based on the Naive Bayes algorithm, which has an accuracy of around 73% to predict the drugs that could be used for the treatment of COVID-19. Our study predicts around ten FDA approved commercial drugs that can be used for repurposing. Among all, we suggest that the antiretroviral drug Atazanavir (DrugBank ID - DB01072) would probably be one of the most effective drugs based on the selected criterions.

ConclusionsOur study can help clinical scientists in being more selective in identifying and testing the therapeutic agents for COVID-19 treatment. The ML based approach for drug discovery as reported here can be a futuristic smart drug designing strategy for community applications.

6182,Prediction of Spreads of COVID-19 in India from Current Trend,"The article describe modelling efforts for evaluating the current level of COVID-19 infections in India, using exponential model. The Data from 15 march 2020 to 30 April 2020 are used for validating the model, where intrinsic rise rate is kept constant. It is observed that some states of India, like MAharastra, Gujarat and Delhi have a much higher daily infection cases. This is modelled by assuming an initial higher infections, keeping rise rate same. The sudden outbursts are captured using offset of values for these three states. Data from other states like Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan are also analysed and they are found to be following the same constants as India is following. Worldwide, many attempts are made to predict outburst of COVID-19 and in the model, described in this paper, turning point is not predicted, as cases in India are still rising. The developed model is based on daily confirmed infections and not on cumulative infections and rationalization is carried out for the population of various regions, while predicting infections for various states. Assigning a decay constant at this stage will be a premature exercise and keeping that in mind, exponential model predicts that India will attain 1 lakh case by 15 May 2020. The figure of 2 lakh and 3 lakh will be attained on 22 May 2020 and 26 May 2020, respectively.","Shekhar, H.",2020-05-06,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.01.20087460,1,Himanshu Shekhar,O/o DG(ACE),https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20087460v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20087460v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
24191,Serological profiles of pan-coronavirus-specific responses in COVID-19 patients using a multiplexed electro-chemiluminescence-based testing platform,"Serological assessment of SARS-CoV-2 specific responses are an essential tool for determining the prevalence of past SARS-CoV-2 infections in the population especially when testing occurs after symptoms have developed and limited contact tracing is in place. The goal of our study was to test a new 10-plex electro-chemiluminescence-based assay to measure IgM and IgG responses to the spike proteins from multiple human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, assess the epitope specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response against full-length spike protein, receptor-binding domain and N-terminal domain of the spike protein, and the nucleocapsid protein. We carried out the assay on samples collected from three sample groups: subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 from the U.S. Army hospital at Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, South Korea; healthcare administrators from the same hospital but with no reported diagnosis of COVID-19; and pre-pandemic samples. We found that the new CoV-specific multiplex assay was highly sensitive allowing plasma samples to be diluted 1:30,000 with a robust signal. The reactivity of IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could distinguish COVID-19 samples from non-COVID-19 and pre-pandemic samples. The data from the three sample groups also revealed a unique pattern of cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and seasonal coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43. Our findings show that the CoV-2 IgM response is highly specific while the CoV-2 IgG response is more cross-reactive across a range of human CoVs and also showed that IgM and IgG responses show distinct patterns of epitope specificity. In summary, this multiplex assay was able to distinguish samples by COVID-19 status and characterize distinct trends in terms of cross-reactivity and fine-specificity in antibody responses, underscoring its potential value in diagnostic or serosurveillance efforts.","Chaudhury, S.; Hutter, J.

8623,Determinants of self-reported symptoms and testing for COVID-19 in Canada using a nationally representative survey,"In April 2020, the first-ever nationally representative survey in Canada polled 4,240 adults age 18 years and older about their COVID experience in March, early in the epidemic. We examined determinants of COVID symptoms, defined as fever plus difficulty breathing/shortness of breath, dry cough so severe that it disrupts sleep, and/or loss of sense of smell; and testing for SARS-CoV-2 by respondents and/or household members. About 8% of Canadians reported that they and/or one or more household members experienced COVID symptoms. Symptoms were more common in younger than older adults, and among visible minorities. Overall, only 3% of respondents and/or household members reported testing for SARS-CoV-2. Being tested was associated with having COVID symptoms, Indigenous identity, and living in Quebec. Periodic nationally representative surveys--including high-risk older populations--of symptoms, as well as SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, are required in many countries to understand the pandemic and prepare for the future.","Wu, D.

25324,B and T cell immune responses elicited by the BNT162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine in nursing home residents,"ObjectivesThe immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine is understudied in elderly people with comorbidities. We assessed SARS-CoV-2-S-targeted antibody and T cell responses following full vaccination in nursing home residents (NHR).

MethodsWe recruited 60 NHR (44 female; median age, 87.5 years), of whom 10 had previously had COVID-19, and 18 healthy controls (15 female; median age, 48.5 years). Pre- and post-vaccination blood specimens were available for quantitation of total antibodies binding RBD and enumeration of SARS-CoV-2-S-reactive IFN-{gamma} CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry.

ResultsThe seroconversion rate in presumably SARS-CoV-2 naive NHR (95.3%), either with or without comorbidities, was similar to controls (94.4%). A robust booster effect was documented in NHR with prior COVID-19. Plasma antibody levels were higher in convalescent NHR than in individuals across the other two groups. A large percentage of NHR had SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IFN-{gamma} CD8+ and/or CD4+ T cells at baseline, in contrast to healthy controls. Either CD8+ and/or CD4+ T-cell responses were documented in all control subjects after vaccination. Contrariwise, the percentage of NHR exhibiting detectable SARS-CoV-2 IFN-{gamma} CD8+ or CD4+ T-cell responses (or both), irrespective of their baseline SARS-CoV-2 infection status, dropped consistently after vaccination. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 IFN-{gamma} CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses in NHR decreased in post-vaccination specimens.

ConclusionThe BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine elicits robust SARS-CoV-2-S antibody responses in NHR. Nevertheless, the frequency and magnitude of detectable SARS-CoV-2 IFN-{gamma} T-cell responses after vaccination was lower in NHR compared to controls.","Torres, I.; Albert, E.; Gimenez, E.; Alcaraz, M.

15819,Trajectory of COVID-19 epidemic in Europe,"The classic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model formulated by Kermack and McKendrick [1] assumes that all individuals in the population are equally susceptible to infection. From fitting such a model to the trajectory of mortality from COVID-19 in 11 European countries up to 4 May 2020 Flaxman et al. concluded that """"major non-pharmaceutical interventions - and lockdowns in particular - have had a large effect on reducing transmission"""" [2]. We show that relaxing the assumption of homogeneity to allow for individual variation in susceptibility or connectivity gives a model that has better fit to the data and more accurate 14-day forward prediction of mortality. Allowing for heterogeneity reduces the estimate of """"counterfactual"""" deaths that would have occurred if there had been no interventions from 3.2 million to 262,000, implying that most of the slowing and reversal of COVID-19 mortality is explained by the build-up of herd immunity. The estimate of the herd immunity threshold depends on the value specified for the infection fatality ratio (IFR): a value of 0.3% for the IFR gives 15% for the average herd immunity threshold.","Colombo, M.; Mellor, J.; Colhoun, H.

13728,Inadequate preparedness for response to COVID-19 is associated with stress and burnout among healthcare workers in Ghana,"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic has compounded the global crisis of stress and burnout among healthcare workers (HCWs). But few studies have empirically examined the factors driving these outcomes. We examined the association between perceived preparedness to respond to the pandemic and HCW stress and burnout and identified potential mediating factors among HCWs in Ghana.

MethodsData are from HCWs in Ghana who completed a cross-sectional self-administered online survey; 414 and 409 HCWs completed stress and burnout questions, respectively. Perceived preparedness, stress, and burnout were measured using validated psychosocial measures. We assessed associations using linear regressions with robust standard errors.

ResultsThe average score for preparedness was 24 (SD = 8.8), 16.3 (SD = 5.9) for stress, and 37.4 (SD = 15.5) for burnout. In multivariate analysis, HCWs who felt somewhat prepared and prepared had lower stress ({beta} = -1.89, 95%CI:-3.49 to -0.30 and {beta} = -2.66, 95%CI:-4.48 to -0.84) and burnout ({beta} = -7.74, 95%CI:-11.8 to -3.64 and {beta} = -9.25, 95%CI:-14.1 to -4.41) scores than those who did not feel prepared. Appreciation from management and family support were associated with lower stress and burnout, while fear of infection was associated with higher stress burnout. Fear of infection partially mediated the relationship between perceived preparedness and stress/burnout, accounting for about 16 to17% of the effect.

ConclusionLow perceived preparedness to respond to COVID-19 increases stress and burnout, and this is partly through fear of infection. Interventions to increase HCWs morale and capacity to respond to the pandemic are needed.

23512,Disulfiram associated with lower risk of Covid-19: a retrospective cohort study,"In the global COVID-19 pandemic, there is a substantial need for effective, low-cost therapeutics. We investigated the potential effects of disulfiram on the incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 in an observational study in a large database of US Veterans Administration clinical records, the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW). The study is motivated by the unique properties of disulfiram, which has been used as an anti-alcoholism drug since 1948, is non-toxic, easy to manufacture and inexpensive. Disulfiram reduces hyperinflammation in mammalian cells by inhibition of the gasdermin D pore. In a mouse model of sepsis, disulfiram reduced inflammatory cytokines and mortality. Disulfiram also is a low micromolar inhibitor of the Mpro and PLpro viral proteases of SARS-CoV-2.

To investigate the potential effects of disulfiram on the incidence and severity of COVID-19, we carried out an epidemiological study in the CDW. The VA dataset used has 944,127 patients tested for SARS-Cov-2, 167,327 with a positive test, and 2,233 on disulfiram, of which 188 had a positive SARS-Cov-2 test. A multivariable Cox regression adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, a diagnosis of alcohol use disorders, and Charlson comorbidity score revealed a reduced incidence of COVID-19 with disulfiram use with a hazard ratio of 0.66 and 95% confidence interval of 0.57 to 0.76 (P < 0.001). There were no deaths among the 188 SARS-Cov-2 positive patients treated with disulfiram. The expected number of deaths would have been 5-6 according to the 3% death rate among the untreated (P-value 0.03).

Our finding of a lower hazard ratio and less severe outcomes for COVID-19 in patients treated with disulfiram compared to those not treated is a statistical association and does not prove any causative effect of disulfiram. However, the results of this study suggest that there is a pharmacological contribution to the reduced incidence and severity of COVID-19 with the use of disulfiram. Given the known anti-inflammatory and viral anti-protease effects of disulfiram, it is reasonable and urgent to initiate accelerated clinical trials to assess whether disulfiram reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease severity and death.

STRUCTURED OUTLINEO_ST_ABSImportanceC_ST_ABSIdentifying already approved medications with well characterized antiviral or anti-inflammatory properties supported by real world evidence as candidates for clinical trials for repurposing is an important strategy to manage the pandemic given the ongoing challenges with producing and administering vaccines, the emergence of more infectious viral mutants and the paucity of approved therapies.

ObjectiveTo investigate the potential effects of disulfiram on the incidence and severity of COVID-19.

DesignRetrospective cohort study from February 20, 2020 to February 1, 2021.

SettingVeterans Health Administration. Veterans who had visited a VA primary care provider in the 18 months before their first SARS-CoV-2 test.

Participants2,233 Veterans with at least one SARS-CoV-2 laboratory (positive or negative) test result on or after February 20, 2020 and at least one pharmacy record for disulfiram on or after February 20, 2019 and 941,894 Veterans without a pharmacy record for disulfiram.

ExposureTreatment with disulfiram

Main OutcomePositive test result for SARS-CoV-2

ResultsA multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, diagnosis of an alcohol use disorder, and Charlson comorbidity score resulted in a reduced hazard of COVID-19 infection with disulfiram use, with a hazard ratio of 0.66 and 95% confidence interval of 0.57 to 0.76 (P < 0.001).

Conclusions and RelevanceThe results of this study suggest that disulfiram use contributes to a reduced incidence of COVID-19. Given the known anti-inflammatory and anti-protease effects of disulfiram, its low cost, low side effects, and general availability, it is reasonable and urgent to initiate accelerated clinical trials to assess the effect of disulfiram on infection and the development of advanced disease.","Fillmore, N.; Bell, S.; Shen, C.; Nguyen, V.; La, J.; Dubreuil, M.; Strymish, J.; Brophy, M.; Mehta, G.; Wu, H.; Lieberman, J.; Do, N.; Sander, C.",2021-03-12,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.03.10.21253331,1,Chris Sander,MSKCC,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.10.21253331v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.10.21253331v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
2819,Prognostic value of C-reactive protein in patients with COVID-19,"BackgroundElevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level was observed in most patients with COVID-19.

MethodsData of COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, were retrospectively collected and analyzed from Jan 30 to Feb 20, 2020. The prognostic value of admission CRP was evaluated in patients with COVID-19.

ResultsOut of 298 patients enrolled, 84 died and 214 recovered. Most non-survivors tended to be males, old aged, or with chronic diseases. Compared to survivors, non-survivors showed significantly elevated white blood cell and neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII, defined by platelet count multiply by NLR), CRP, procalcitonin, and D-dimer, and decreased red blood cell, lymphocyte, and platelet count. Age, neutrophil count, platelet count, and CRP were identified as independent predictors of adverse outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of CRP (0.896) was significantly higher than that of age (0.833), neutrophil count (0.820), and platelet count (0.678) in outcome prediction (all p<0.05). With a cut-off value of 41.4, CRP exhibited sensitivity 90.5%, specificity 77.6%, positive predictive value 61.3%, and negative predictive value 95.4%. Subgroup analysis revealed that CRP remained robust accuracy in adverse outcome prediction in patients with different disease severity (AUC 0.832, z=10.23, p<0.001; AUC 0.989, z=44.04, p<0.001). CRP was also an independent discriminator of severe/critical illness on admission (AUC 0.783, z=10.69, p<0.001).

ConclusionsIn patients with COVID-19, admission CRP correlated with disease severity and tended to be a good predictor of adverse outcome.","Luo, X.; Zhou, W.; Yan, X.; Guo, T.; Wang, B.; Xia, H.; Ye, L.; Xiong, J.; Jiang, Z.; Liu, Y.; Zhang, B.; Yang, W.",2020-03-23,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.21.20040360,1,Xiaomin Luo,Renmin hospital of Wuhan University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040360v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040360v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1093/cid/ciaa641

MethodsA cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted among 1,021 RT-PCR confirmed but recovered COVID-19 cases from six participating hospitals in Bangladesh.

ResultsOf the total sample, 111 (10.9%) cases were asymptomatic while the number of symptomatic cases were 910 (89.1%). Higher prevalence of COVID-19 persisted in the male population (75%) and for the 31-40 age group. More than 85% of the samples reported BCG vaccination mark. Common symptoms observed in our study samples were fever (72.4%), cough (55.9%), loss of taste (40.7%) and body ache (40%); whereas for the biochemical parameters, Neutrophil (46.4%), D-dimer (46.1%), Ferritin (37.9%) and SGPT (36.8%) levels were found elevated. Post-COVID complications including pain (31.8%), loss of concentration (24.4%) and anxiety or depression (23.1%) were found significantly prevalent.

ConclusionOur study has shown that adult males aged between 31-40 in Bangladesh are more vulnerable to being infected with COVID-19.

2499,The demand for inpatient and ICU beds for COVID-19 in the US: lessons from Chinese cities,"BackgroundSustained spread of SARS-CoV-2 has happened in major US cities. Capacity needs in Chinese cities could inform the planning of local healthcare resources.

MethodsWe described the intensive care unit (ICU) and inpatient bed needs for confirmed COVID-19 patients in two Chinese cities (Wuhan and Guangzhou) from January 10 to February 29, 2020, and compared the timing of disease control measures in relation to the timing of SARS-CoV-2 community spread. We estimated the peak ICU bed needs in US cities if a Wuhan-like outbreak occurs.

ResultsIn Wuhan, strict disease control measures were implemented six weeks after sustained local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Between January 10 and February 29, COVID-19 patients accounted for an average of 637 ICU patients and 3,454 serious inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 19,425 patients (24.5 per 10,000 adults) were hospitalized, 9,689 (12.2 per 10,000 adults) were considered to be in serious condition, and 2,087 patients (2.6 per 10,000 adults) needed critical care per day. In Guangzhou, strict disease control measures were implemented within one week of case importation. Between January 24 and February 29, COVID-19 accounted for an average of 9 ICU patients and 20 inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 15 patients were in critical condition, and 38 were classified as serious. If a Wuhan-like outbreak were to happen in a US city, the need for healthcare resources may be higher in cities with a higher prevalence of vulnerable populations.

ConclusionEven after the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, the number of seriously ill COVID-19 patients continued to rise, exceeding local hospitalization and ICU capacities for at least a month. Plans are urgently needed to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 outbreaks on the local healthcare system in US cities.","Li, R.; Rivers, C.; Tan, Q.; Murray, M.

21362,Identification of COVID-19 Subtypes Based on Immunogenomic Profiling,"Although previous studies have shown that the host immune response is crucial in determining clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, the association between host immune signatures and COVID-19 patient outcomes remains unclear. Based on the enrichment levels of 11 immune signatures (eight immune-inciting and three immune-inhibiting signatures) in leukocytes of 100 COVID-19 patients, we identified three COVID-19 subtypes: Im-C1, Im-C2, and Im-C3, by clustering analysis. Im-C1 had the lowest immune-inciting signatures and high immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C2 had medium immune-inciting signatures and high immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C3 had the highest immune-inciting signatures while the lowest immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C3 and Im-C1 displayed the best and worst clinical outcomes, respectively, suggesting that antiviral immune responses alleviated the severity of COVID-19 patients. We further demonstrated that the adaptive immune response had a stronger impact on COVID-19 outcomes than the innate immune response. The patients in Im-C3 were younger than those in Im-C1, indicating that younger persons have stronger antiviral immune responses than older persons. Nevertheless, we did not observe a significant association between sex and immune responses in COVID-19 patients. In addition, we found that the type II IFN response signature was an adverse prognostic factor for COVID-19. Our identification of COVID-19 immune subtypes has potential clinical implications for the management of COVID-19 patients.","Feng, Q.; Wang, X.",2021-01-26,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.01.24.21250387,1,Xiaosheng Wang,China Pharmaceutical University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.24.21250387v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.24.21250387v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
5227,Measuring Italian Citizens' Engagement in the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic Containment Measures A Cross-sectional Study,"BackgroundIn January 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started to spread in Italy. The Italian government adopted urgent measures to hold its spread. Enforcing compliance to such measures is crucial in order to enhance their effectiveness. Engaging citizens in the COVID-19 preventive process is today urgent in Italy and around the world. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the role of health engagement in predicting citizens compliance to health emergency containment measures.

MethodAn online survey was administered between February 28th and March 4th 2020 on a representative sample of 1000 Italians. The questionnaire included a measure of Health Engagement (PHE-S) and a series of ad hoc items intended to measure both affective and behavioral responses of the citizens to the emergency in terms of perceived susceptibility to and severity of the disease, orientation towards health management, change in habits and in purchases. To investigate the relationship between Health Engagement and these variables, a series of ANOVAs, Logistic regressions and crosstabs have been carried out.

ResultsLess engaged people show higher levels of perceived susceptibility to the virus and of severity of the disease; they trust less scientific and healthcare authorities, they feel less self-effective in managing their own health - both in normal conditions and under stress - and are less prone to cooperate with healthcare professionals. Low levels of Health Engagement are also associated with a change in the usual purchase behavior.

ConclusionsThe Patient Health Engagement Model (PHE) provides a useful framework for understanding how people will respond to health threats such as pandemics. Therefore, intervention studies should focus on particular groups and on raising their levels of engagement to increase the effectiveness of educational initiatives devoted to promote preventive behaviors.","Graffigna, G.; Barello, S.; Savarese, M.; Palamenghi, L.; Castellini, G.; Bonanomi, A.; Lozza, E.",2020-04-25,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.04.22.20075234,1,Serena Barello,Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20075234v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20075234v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1371/journal.pone.0238613
22504,"Predicting mortality, duration of treatment, pulmonary embolism and required ceiling of ventilatory support for COVID-19 inpatients: A Machine-Learning Approach","IntroductionWithin the UK, COVID-19 has contributed towards over 103,000 deaths. Multiple risk factors for COVID-19 have been identified including various demographics, co-morbidities, biochemical parameters, and physical assessment findings. However, using this vast data to improve clinical care has proven challenging.

Aimsto develop a reliable, multivariable predictive model for COVID-19 in-patient outcomes, to aid risk-stratification and earlier clinical decision-making.

MethodsAnonymized data regarding 44 independent predictor variables of 355 adults diagnosed with COVID-19, at a UK hospital, was manually extracted from electronic patient records for retrospective, case-controlled analysis. Primary outcomes included inpatient mortality, level of ventilatory support and oxygen therapy required, and duration of inpatient treatment. Secondary pulmonary embolism was the only secondary outcome. After balancing data, key variables were feature selected for each outcome using random forests. Predictive models were created using Bayesian Networks, and cross-validated.

ResultsOur multivariable models were able to predict, using feature selected risk factors, the probability of inpatient mortality (F1 score 83.7%, PPV 82%, NPV 67.9%); level of ventilatory support required (F1 score varies from 55.8% """"High-flow Oxygen level"""" to 71.5% """"ITU-Admission level""""); duration of inpatient treatment (varies from 46.7% for """"[&ge;] 2 days but < 3 days"""" to 69.8% """"[&le;] 1 day""""); and risk of pulmonary embolism sequelae (F1 score 85.8%, PPV of 83.7%, and NPV of 80.9%).

ConclusionOverall, our findings demonstrate reliable, multivariable predictive models for 4 outcomes, that utilize readily available clinical information for COVID-19 adult inpatients. Further research is required to externally validate our models and demonstrate their utility as clinical decision-making tools.

20113,Rapid COVID-19 Diagnosis Using Deep Learning of the Computerized Tomography Scans,"Several studies suggest that COVID-19 may be accompanied by symptoms such as a dry cough, muscle aches, sore throat, and mild to moderate respiratory illness. The symptoms of this disease indicate the fact that COVID-19 causes noticeable negative effects on the lungs. Therefore, considering the health status of the lungs using X-rays and CT scans of the chest can significantly help diagnose COVID-19 infection. Due to the fact that most of the methods that have been proposed to COVID-19 diagnose deal with the lengthy testing time and also might give more false positive and false negative results, this paper aims to review and implement artificial intelligence (AI) image-based diagnosis methods in order to detect coronavirus infection with zero or near to zero false positives and false negatives rates. Besides the already existing AI image-based medical diagnosis method for the other well-known disease, this study aims on finding the most accurate COVID-19 detection method among AI methods such as machine learning (ML) and artificial neural network (ANN), ensemble learning (EL) methods.","Tabrizchi, H.; Mosavi, A.; Szabo-Gali, A.; Nadai, L.",2020-12-23,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.12.20.20248582,1,Amir Mosavi,Obuda University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.20.20248582v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.20.20248582v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
3756,Can N95 respirators be reused after disinfection? And for how many times?,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a major shortage of N95 respirators, which are essential to protecting healthcare professionals and the general public who may come into contact with the virus. Thus, it is essential to determine how we can reuse respirators and other personal protection in these urgent times. We investigated multiple commonly used and easily deployable, scalable disinfection schemes on media with particle filtration efficiency of 95%. Among these, heating ([&le;]85 {degrees}C) under various humidities ([&le;]100% RH) was the most promising, nondestructive method for the preservation of filtration properties in meltblown fabrics as well as N95-grade respirators. Heating can be applied up to 50 cycles (85 {degrees}C, 30% RH) without observation in the degradation of meltblown filtration performance. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was a secondary choice which was able to withstand 10 cycles of treatment and showed small degradation by 20 cycles. However, UV can also potentially impact the material strength and fit of respirators. Finally, treatments involving liquids and vapors require caution, as steam, alcohol, and household bleach may all lead to degradation of the filtration efficiency, leaving the user vulnerable to the viral aerosols.","Liao, L.; Xiao, W.; Zhao, M.; Yu, X.; Wang, H.; Wang, Q.; Chu, S.; Cui, Y.",2020-04-17,Occupational And Environmental Health,10.1101/2020.04.01.20050443,2,Yi Cui,Stanford University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050443v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050443v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.1021/acsnano.0c03597

In this study, we hypothesize that the weather indicators could significantly influence the impact of the corona virus. The Kendall and Spearman rank correlation tests were chosen to conduct the statistical analysis. In this regard, we compiled a daily dataset including confirmed case counts, Recovered case counts, Deceased cases, Average Temperature, Maximum Relative Humidity, Maximum Wind Speed for six most affected states of India during the period of March 25, 2020 to April 24, 2020. We investigated that the average Humidity and Average Temperature seven days ago play a significant role in the recovery of coronavirus cases. The rise in average temperature will improve the recovery rate in the days to come.

22675,COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy in Underserved Communities of North Carolina,"BackgroundIn the United States, underserved communities including Blacks and Latinx are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and widespread vaccination is critical for curbing this pandemic. This study sought to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, describe attitudes related to vaccination, and identify correlates among racial minority and marginalized populations across 9 counties in North Carolina.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional survey with a self-administered questionnaire distributed at free COVID-19 testing events in underserved rural and urban communities from August 27 - December 15, 2020. Vaccine hesitancy was defined as the response of """"no"""" or """"dont know/not sure"""" to whether the participant would get the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it became available.

ResultsThe sample comprised 948 participants including 27.7% Whites, 59.6% Blacks, 12.7% Latinx, and 63% female. Thirty-two percent earned <$20K annually, 60% owned a computer and [~]80% had internet access at home. The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was 68.9% including 62.7%, 74%, and 59.5% among Whites, Blacks, and Latinx, respectively. Between September and December, the largest decline in vaccine hesitancy occurred among Whites (27.5 percentage points), followed by Latinx (17.6) and the smallest decline was among Black respondents (12.0). 51.2% of the respondents reported vaccine safety concerns, 23.7% wanted others to get of the respondents reported they would trust health care providers with information about the COVID-19 vaccine. Factors associated with hesitancy in multivariable logistic regression included being female (OR=1.90 95%CI[1.36, 2.64]), being Black (OR=1.68 [1.106 2.45]), calendar month (OR=0.76 [0.63, 0.92]), safety concerns (OR=4.28 [3.06, 5.97]), and government distrust (OR=3.57 [2.26, 5.63]).

ConclusionsThis study reached underserved minority populations in a number of different locations to investigate COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. We built on existing relationships and further engaged the community, stake holders and health department to provide free COVID-19 testing. This direct approach permitted assessment of vaccine hesitancy (which was much higher than national estimates), distrust, and safety concerns.

HighlightsO_LIThis study surveyed 948 adults at COVID-19 testing sites in 9 counties of North Carolina between August 27 and December 15, 2020 where vaccine hesitancy was widespread including 74% in Blacks, 62.7% in Whites and 59.5% in Latinx.
C_LIO_LIVaccine hesitancy declined over time but remained high for Blacks.
C_LIO_LIOn-site surveys conducted in underserved areas that were paper-based and self-administered permitted reaching adults with no internet (17%), no cell phone (20%), no computer (40%) and yearly incomes less than 20K (31%).
C_LIO_LIWidespread vaccine hesitancy in predominately minority communities of NC must be addressed to successfully implement mass COVID-19 vaccination programs.

A positive result of antibody tests suggests that the individual has potentially been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, thus allowing to identify asymptomatic infections and determine the seroprevalence in a given population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of a newly developed high throughput immunoassay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody detection on the Luminex MAGPIX platform. Clinical agreement studies were performed in 42 COVID-19 patient serum samples and 162 negative donor serum/plasma samples. Positive percent agreement (PPA) was 42.86% (95% CI: 9.90% to 81.59%), 71.43% (95% CI: 29.04% to 96.33%), and 28.57% (95% CI: 13.22% to 48.67%) for samples collected on 0-7 days, 8-14 days, and 2-8 weeks from symptom onset, respectively. Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) was 97.53% (95% CI: 93.80% to 99.32%). There was no cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody Hemoglobin (200 mg/dL), bilirubin (2 mg/dL), triglyceride (250 mg/dL) and EDTA (10 mM) showed no significant interfering effect on this assay.

Methods and FindingsWe included all patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the safety net hospital for San Francisco through April 8, 2020. Each patient had [&ge;]15 days of follow-up. Among 26 patients, the median age was 54 years (interquartile range, 43 to 62), 65% were men, and 77% were Latinx. Mechanical ventilation was initiated for 11 (42%) patients within 24 hours of ICU admission and 20 patients (77%) overall. The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 13.5 days (interquartile range, 5 to 20). Patients were managed with lung protective ventilation (tidal volume [&le;]8 ml/kg of ideal body weight and plateau pressure [&le;]30 cmH2O on 98% and 78% of ventilator days, respectively). Prone positioning was used for 13 of 20 (65%) ventilated patients for a median of 5 days (interquartile range, 2 to 10).

DesignObservational, descriptive study of ICUs monitored by a tele-ICU system across Northwell Health. Inclusion criteria: All patients admitted to Northwell Health tele-ICUs during 2019 and between March 23, 2020 and April 6, 2020.

ExposureA data extract was developed to collect data every hour for each ICU bed in the Northwell tele-critical care program as a quality reporting initiative to understand ICU capacity and resource utilization. A similar extract was developed for each hour of 2019.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresAverage of any given hour during the pre-COVID-19 and pandemic periods for the following metrics: proportion of beds occupied, proportion of ventilated patients, severity of illness (measured by the ICU Discharge Readiness Score (DRS)), and length of stay (LOS).

ResultsHourly analysis of data from 186 ICU beds from 14 ICUs and 9 hospitals were included, representing 10,714 patients in 2019 and 465 patients between March 23 and April 6, 2020. Average hourly occupancy increased from 64% to 78%, while the proportion of patients invasively ventilated increased from 33.9% to 84.2%.

However, little is known regarding the systematic review of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity. The current study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, aimed to estimate the incidence of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity after recovery from COVID-19 and to determine the factors associated with recurrent positivity.

MethodsWe searched the PubMed, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry for studies published to June 12, 2020. Studies were reviewed to determine the risk of bias. A random-effects model was used to pool results. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2.

ResultsFourteen studies of 2,568 individuals were included. The incidence of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 14.81% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.44-18.19%). The pooled estimate of the interval from disease onset to recurrence was 35.44 days (95% CI: 32.65-38.24 days), and from the last negative to recurrent positive result was 9.76 days (95% CI: 7.31-12.22 days). Patients with younger age (mean difference [MD]=-2.27, 95% CI: -2.95 to -1.80) and a longer initial illness (MD=8.24 days; 95% CI: 7.54 - 8.95; I2=98.9%) were more likely to experience recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity, while patients with diabetes (RR=0.52; 95% CI: 0.30-0.90; I2=53%), severe disease (RR=0.54; 95% CI: 0.35-0.84; I2=70%), and a low lymphocyte count (RR=0.58; 95% CI: 0.39 - 0.86; I2=48%) were less likely to experience recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity.

ConclusionsThe incidence of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 14.81%.

16479,Rapid and Low-cost Sampling for Detection of Airborne SARS-CoV-2 in Dehumidifier Condensate,"Airborne spread of COVID-19 by infectious aerosol is all but certain. However, easily implemented approaches to assess the actual environmental threat are currently unavailable. We present a simple approach with the potential to rapidly provide information about the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the atmosphere at any location. We used a portable dehumidifier as a readily available and affordable tool to collect airborne virus in the condensate. The dehumidifiers were deployed in selected locations of a hospital ward with patients reporting flu like symptoms which could possibly be due to COVID-19 over three separate periods of one week. Samples were analyzed frequently for both virus envelope protein and SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In several samples across separate deployments, condensate from dehumidifiers tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens and confirmed using two independent assays. RNA was detected, but not attributable to SARS-CoV-2. Our results point to a facile pool testing method to sample air in any location in the world and assess the presence and concentration of the infectious agent in order to obtain quantitative risk assessment of exposure, designate zones as  hot spots and minimize the need for individual testing which may often be time consuming, expensive and laborious.","Moitra, P.; Alafeef, M.; Dighe, K.; Ray, P.; Chang, J.; Ramamurthy, S.

25341,Strategies for COVID-19 vaccination under a shortage scenario: a geo-stochastic modelling approach.,"In a world being hit by waves of COVID-19, vaccination is a light on the horizon. However, the roll-out of vaccination strategies and their influence on the pandemic are still open problems. In order to compare the effect of various strategies proposed by the World Health Organization and other authorities, a previously developed SEIRS stochastic model of geographical spreading of the virus is extended by adding a compartment for vaccinated people. The parameters of the model were fitted to describe the pandemic evolution in Argentina, Mexico and Spain to analyze the effect of the proposed vaccination strategies. The mobility parameters allow to simulate different social behaviors (e.g. lock-down interventions). Schemes in which vaccines are applied homogeneously in all the country, or limited to the most densely-populated areas, are simulated and compared. The second strategy is found to be more effective. Moreover, under the current global shortage of vaccines, it should be remarked that immunization is enhanced when mobility is reduced. Additionally, repetition of vaccination campaigns should be timed considering the immunity lapse of the vaccinated (and recovered) people. Finally, the model is extended to include the effect of isolation of detected positive cases, shown to be important to reduce infections.","Barreiro, N. L.; Ventura, C.

3838,Feasibility of Controlling COVID-19 Outbreaks in the UK by Rolling Interventions,"BackgroundRecent outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led a rapid global spread around the world. For controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, many countries have implemented two non-pharmaceutical interventions: suppression like immediate lock-downs in cities at epicentre of outbreak; or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both interventions have apparent pros and cons; the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is limited. We aimed to conduct a feasibility study for robustly estimating the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, peaks and lengths of COVID-19 breakouts by taking multiple interventions in London and the UK, accounting for reduction of healthcare demand.

MethodsWe developed a model to attempt to infer the impact of mitigation, suppression and multiple rolling interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in London and the UK. Our model assumed that each intervention has equivalent effect on the reproduction number R across countries and over time; where its intensity was presented by average-number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals; early immediate intensive intervention led to increased health need and social anxiety. We considered two important features: direct link between Exposed and Recovered population, and practical healthcare demand by separation of infections into mild and critical cases. Our model was fitted and calibrated with data on cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan to estimate how suppression intervention impacted on the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths over time during January 2020, and April 2020. We combined the calibrated model with data on the cases of COVID-19 in London and non-London regions in the UK during February 2020 and March 2020 to estimate the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, and healthcare demand by using multiple interventions.

FindingsWe estimated given that multiple interventions with an intensity range from 3 to 15, one optimal strategy was to take suppression with intensity 3 in London from 23rd March for 100 days, and 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in non-London regions. In this scenario, the total infections and deaths in the UK were limited to 2.43 million and 33.8 thousand; the peak time of healthcare demand was due to the 65th day (April 11th), where it needs hospital beds for 25.3 thousand severe and critical cases. If we took a simultaneous 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in all regions of the UK, the total infections and deaths increased slightly to 2.69 million and 37 thousand; the peak time of healthcare kept the same at the 65th day, where it needs equivalent hospital beds for severe and critical cases of 25.3 thousand. But if we released high band of rolling intervention intensity to 6 or 8 and simultaneously implemented them in all regions of the UK, the COVID-19 outbreak would not end in 1 year and distribute a multi-modal mode, where the total infections and deaths in the UK possibly reached to 16.2 million and 257 thousand.

InterpretationOur results show that taking rolling intervention is probably an optimal strategy to effectively and efficiently control COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK. As large difference of population density and social distancing between London and non-London regions in the UK, it is more appropriate to implement consistent suppression in London for 100 days and rolling intervention in other regions. This strategy would potentially reduce the overall infections and deaths, and delay and reduce peak healthcare demand.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSuppression and mitigation are two common interventions for controlling infectious disease outbreaks. Previous works show rapid suppression is able to immediately reduce infections to low levels by eliminating human-to-human transmission, but needs consistent maintenance; mitigation does not interrupt transmission completely and tolerates some increase of infections, but minimises health and economic impacts of viral spread.3 While current planning in many countries is focused on implementing either suppression or mitigation, it is not clear how and when to take which level of interventions for control COVID-19 breakouts to certain country in light of balancing its healthcare demands and economic impacts.

Added value of this studyWe used a mathematical model to access the feasibility of multiple intervention to control COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK. Our model distinguished self-recovered populations, infection with mild and critical cases for estimating healthcare demand. It combined available evidence from available data source in Wuhan. We estimated how suppression, mitigation and multiple rolling interventions impact on controlling outbreaks in London and non-London regions of the UK. We provided an evidence verification point that implementing suppression in London and rolling intervention with high intensity in non-London regions is probably an optimal strategy to control COVID-19 breakouts in the UK with minimised deaths and economic impacts.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe effectiveness and impact of suppression and mitigation to control outbreaks of COVID-19 depends on intervention intensity and duration, which remain unclear at the present time. Using the current best understanding of this model, implementing consistent suppression in London for 100 days and 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in other regions potentially limit the total deaths in the UK to 33.8 thousand. Future research on how to quantify and measure intervention activities could improve precision on control estimates.","Yang, P.; Qi, J.; Zhang, S.; Bi, G.; Wang, X.; Yang, Y.; Sheng, B.; Mao, X.",2020-04-14,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.05.20054429,2,Po Yang,The University of Sheffield,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054429v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054429v2.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
9796,"Risk factors for critical-ill events of patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","BackgroundLittle is known about the risk factors for critical-ill events (intensive care, invasive ventilation, or death) in patients with COVID-19.

MethodsPatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital from February 13 to March 14 was retrospectively analyzed. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values at baseline, comorbidities, treatments and clinical outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between patients with and without critical-ill events. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate logistic regression models were developed to explore the risk factors for critical-ill events. A risk nomogram was established to predict the probability for the critical-ill events. Survival analysis of patients with critical-ill events was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method.

Results463 COVID-19 patients were included in this study, of whom 397 were non-critically ill and 66 were critically ill (all from the intensive care unit). The LASSO regression identified four variables (hypersensitive cardiac troponin I, blood urea nitrogen, haemoglobin, and interleukin-6) contributing to the critical-ill events. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital critical-ill events associated with hypersensitive cTnI greater than 0.04 ng/mL (OR 20.98,95% CI 3.51-125.31), blood urea nitrogen greater than 7.6 mmol/L (OR 5.22, 95% CI 1.52-17.81, decreased haemoglobin (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.04-1.10), and higher interleukin-6 (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.08) on admission.

ConclusionsHypersensitive cTnI greater than 0.04 ng/mL, blood urea nitrogen greater than 7.6 mmol/L, decreased haemoglobin, and high IL-6 were risk factors of critical-ill events in patients with COVID-19.

Main pointHypersensitive cTnI greater than 0.04 ng/mL, BUN greater than 7.6 mmol/L, decreased haemoglobin, and high IL-6 were risk factors of critical-ill events (intensive care, invasive ventilation, or death) in patients with COVID-19.","Yang, S.; Ma, L.; Wang, Y.-L.; Wang, Q.; Tong, Q.; Chen, M.; Zhang, H.; Yu, D.-H.; Dai, S.-M.; Cui, R.",2020-06-16,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.14.20130765,1,Ran Cui,Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People\'s Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.14.20130765v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.14.20130765v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
24624,Racial Disparities in the SOFA Score Among Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19,"BackgroundSequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score predicts probability of in-hospital mortality. Many crisis standards of care use SOFA score to allocate medical resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Research QuestionAre SOFA scores disproportionately elevated among Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients hospitalized with COVID-19, compared to Non-Hispanic White patients?

Study Design and MethodsRetrospective cohort study conducted in Yale New Haven Health System, including 5 hospitals with total of 2681 beds. Study population drawn from consecutive patients aged [&ge;]18 admitted with COVID-19 from March 29th to August 1st, 2020. Patients excluded from the analysis if not their first admission with COVID-19, if they did not have SOFA score recorded within 24 hours of admission, if race and ethnicity data were not Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic White, or Hispanic, or if they had other missing data. The primary outcomes was SOFA score, with peak score within 24 hours of admission dichotomized as <6 or [&ge;]6.

10232,Estimation of Undetected Symptomatic and Asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 Infection and prediction of its spread in USA,"The reported COVID-19 cases in the USA have crossed over 2 million, and a large number of infected cases are undetected whose estimation can be done if country-wide antibody testing is performed. In this work, we estimate this undetected fraction of the population by modeling and simulation approach. We propose a new epidemic model SIPHERD in which three categories of infection carriers Symptomatic, Purely Asymptomatic, and Exposed are considered with different transmission rates that are taken dependent on the lockdown conditions, and the detection rate of the infected carriers is taken dependent on the tests done per day. The model is first validated for Germany and South Korea and then applied for prediction of total number of confirmed, active and death, and daily new positive cases in the United States. Our study also demonstrates the possibility of a second wave of the infection if social distancing regulations are relaxed to a large extent. We estimate that around 12.7 million people are already infected, and in the absence of any vaccine, 17.7 million (range: 16.3-19.2) people, or 5.3% (range: 4.9-5.8) of the population will be infected by when the disease spread ends in the USA.

16549,The Characteristics of Health Care Workers with COVID-19 and Relationship Between COVID-19 Mortality and BCG/Tuberculosis History: a multi-center study,"BackgroundToday, COVID-19 pandemic has brought countries health services into sharp focus. Despite the low incidence of cases(1.2%) and high mortality rate(2.4%) among Turkish population, the low mortality rate(0.3%) despite the high incidence(11.5%) declared in healthcare workers drew our groups attention. Therefore, we aimed to report the characteristics of infected health-care workers and investigate the relationship between BCG vaccine and tuberculosis history with COVID-19 mortality in infected health-care worker population.

MethodThis study was conducted in three hospitals to assess the clinical presentations, disease severity and correlation with BCG vaccine and tuberculous history in COVID-19 positive health-care workers by an online questionnaire platform. The relationship between characteristics and tuberculosis history were investigated according to hospitalization status of the patients.

ResultTotal of 465 infected healthcare workers included in the study. The rate of history of direct care and contact to tuberculosis patient, presence of previous tuberculosis treatment and BCG scar, presence of radiological infiltrations was significantly higher in hospitalized healthcare workers. The ratio of direct care and direct contact to the patient with tuberculosis, and presence of family history of tuberculosis were statistically significantly higher in patients with radiological infiltrations.

ConclusionAlthough COVID-19 risk and incidence are higher among healthcare workers compared to the normal population due to higher virus load, this study brings evidence for the fact that the lower mortality rate seen in infected healthcare workers might be due to healthcare workers frequent exposure to tuberculosis bacillus and the mortality-reducing effects of BCG vaccine, despite the higher hospitalization rate and radiological infiltrations due to over-triggered immune system.","Torun, S.; Ozkaya, S.; Sen, N.; Kanat, F.; Karaman, I.; Yosunkaya, S.; Sengoren Dikis, O.; Asan, A.; Aydogan Eroglu, S.; Atal, S.

Here we propose an extended SEIR model to explore the dynamics of containment and then explore scenarios for the local extinction of the disease. We present both the deterministic and stochastic version fo the model and derive the [R]0 and the probability of local extinction after relaxation (elimination of transmission) of containment, [P]0. We show that local extinctions are possible without further interventions, with reasonable probability, as long as the number of active cases is driven to single digits and strict control of case importation is maintained. The maintenance of defensive behaviors, such as using masks and avoiding agglomerations are also important factors. We also explore the importance of population immunity even when above the herd immunity threshold.","Coelho, F. C.; Carvalho, L. M.; Lana, R. M.; Cruz, O. G.; Bastos, L. S.; Codeco, C. T.; Gomes, M.

11619,Comparison of the COVID-19 infection risks by close contact and aerosol transmission,"A comprehensive understanding of the transmission routes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is of great importance for the effective control of the spread of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Human-to-human transmission by close contact where large respiratory droplets play a significant role has been established as the main transmission route. At the same time the transmission by small aerosol is getting increasing attention. There is no distinct boundary between droplets and aerosol in nature so it is natural to investigate the infection risk due to aerosol. Here, we utilized a newly developed dose-response relation, combined with a box model for the exposure estimation, to quantitatively evaluate the infection risk of SARS-CoV-2 through aerosol transmission and compared with the risk due to close contact. The results indicated that the median infection risk via aerosol transmission was about 3.7x10-5 (95% confidence interval: 3.5x10-6 to 4.4x10-4) for one hour of exposure in a room with the size of 10 m (width)x10 m (length)x3 m (height) with one infected individual in it. The risk was more than three orders of magnitude lower than the risk at short distance, about 12.8% within 1 m, based on a meta-analysis. A simple exponential regression model Risk=10-0.90xD+0.10 (D<=5 m) could be utilized to characterize the magnitude of infection risk in the considered scenario based on the distance D from the infected individual. With prolonged exposure duration and large exposed population, the infection caused by aerosol transmission could be considerable, thus it is necessary to be cautious for the potential aerosol transmission risk in such situations.","Zhang, X.; Wang, J.",2020-07-15,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.07.13.20152900,1,Jing Wang,"1.

5871,Incidence of COVID-19 and Connections with Air Pollution Exposure: Evidence from the Netherlands,"The fast spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has resulted in the emergence of several hot-spots around the world. Several of these are located in areas associated with high levels of air pollution. This study investigates the relationship between exposure to particulate matter and COVID-19 incidence in 355 municipalities in the Netherlands. The results show that atmospheric particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 is a highly significant predictor of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and related hospital admissions. The estimates suggest that expected COVID-19 cases increase by nearly 100 percent when pollution concentrations increase by 20 percent. The association between air pollution and case incidence is robust in the presence of data on health-related preconditions, proxies for symptom severity, and demographic control variables. The results are obtained with ground-measurements and satellite-derived measures of atmospheric particulate matter as well as COVID-19 data from alternative dates. The findings call for further investigation into the association between air pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. If particulate matter plays a significant role in COVID-19 incidence, it has strong implications for the mitigation strategies required to prevent spreading.

HighlightsO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSResearch on viral respiratory infections has found that infection risks increase following exposure to high concentrations of particulate matter. Several hot-spots of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 infections are in areas associated with high levels of air pollution.

ApproachThis study investigates the relationship between exposure to particulate matter and COVID-19 incidence in 355 municipalities in the Netherlands using data on confirmed cases and hospital admissions coded by residence, along with local PM2.5, PM10, population density, demographics and health-related pre-conditions. The analysis utilizes different regression specifications that allow for spatial dependence, nonlinearity, alternative error distributions and outlier treatment.

ResultsPM2.5 is a highly significant predictor of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and related hospital admissions. Taking the WHO guideline of 10mcg/m3 as a baseline, the estimates suggest that expected COVID-19 cases increase by nearly 100% when pollution concentrations increase by 20%.

ConclusionThe findings call for further investigation into the association between air pollution on SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. If particulate matter plays a significant role in the incidence of COVID-19 disease, it has strong implications for the mitigation strategies required to prevent spreading, particularly in areas that have high levels of pollution.","Andree, B.

6982,"Outbreak of Kawasaki disease in children during COVID-19 pandemic: a prospective observational study in Paris, France","BackgroundAcute clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are less frequent and less severe in children than in adults. However, recent observations raised concerns about potential post-viral severe inflammatory reactions in children infected with SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsWe describe an outbreak of cases of Kawasaki disease (KD) admitted between April 27 and May 7, 2020, in the general paediatrics department of a university hospital in Paris, France. All children prospectively underwent nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology testing, and echocardiography. The number of admissions for KD during the study period was compared to that observed since January 1, 2018, based on discharge codes, using Poisson regression.

ResultsA total of 17 children were admitted for KD over an 11-day period, in contrast with a mean of 1.0 case per 2-week period over 2018-2019 (Poisson incidence rate ratio: 13.2 [95% confidence interval: 7.3-24.1], p <0.001). Their median age was 7.5 (range, 3.7-16.6) years, and 59% of patients originated from sub-Saharan Africa or Caribbean islands. Eleven patients presented with KD shock syndrome (KDSS) requiring intensive care support, and 12 had myocarditis. All children had marked gastrointestinal symptoms at the early stage of illness and high levels of inflammatory markers. Fourteen patients (82%) had evidence of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive RT-PCR 7/17, positive IgG antibody detection 14/16). All patients received immunoglobulins and some received corticosteroids (5/17). The clinical outcome was favourable in all patients.

ObjectWe examined mobility information provided by Apple Inc. to a susceptible-infected-recovery model.

MethodWhen applying a polynomial function to daily Apple data with the SIR model, we presumed the function up to a cubic term as in our earlier study.

ResultsEstimation results demonstrated R0 as 1.507 and its 95% confidence interval was [1.502, 1.509].. The estimated coefficients of Apple data was 1.748 and its 95% confidence interval was [1.731, 1.788].

Discussion and ConclusionResults show that mobility data from Apple Inc. can explain the entire course of the outbreak in COVID-19 in Japan. Therefore, monitoring Apple data might be sufficient to adjust control measures to maintain an effective reproduction number of less than one.","Kurita, J.; Sugawara, T.; Ohkusa, Y.",2020-06-08,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.04.26.20081315,4,Junko Kurita,"Department of Nursing Tokiwa University, Ibaraki, Japan",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.20081315v4?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.20081315v4.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

18326,COVID-19 Quarantine Reveals Grade-specific Behavioral Modification of Myopia: One-Million Chinese Schoolchildren Study,"BackgroundHigh prevalence of myopia of adolescent has been a global public health concern. Their risk factors and effective prevention methods for myopia across schoolchildren developmental stages are critically needed but remain uncertain due to the difficulty in implementing intervention measurements under normal life situation. We aimed to study the impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on myopia development among over one-million schoolchildren.

MethodsWe designed the ongoing longitudinal project of Myopic Epidemiology and Intervention Study (MEIS) to biannually examine myopia among millions of schoolchildren for ten years in Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China. In the present study, we performed three examinations of myopia in 1,305 elementary and high schools for schoolchildren in June 2019, December 2019 and June 2020. We used the normal period (June-December 2019) and COVID-19 quarantine period (January-June 2020) for comparisons. Myopia was defined as an uncorrected visual acuity of 20/25 or less and a spherical equivalent refraction (SER) of -0.5 diopters (D) or less. High myopia was defined as an SER of -6.0 D or less.

FindingsIn June 2019, 1,001,749 students aged 7-18 were eligible for examinations. In the 6-month and 12-month follow-up studies, there were 813,755 eligible students (81.2%) and 768,492 eligible students (76.7%), respectively. Among all students, we found that half-year myopia progression increased approximate 1.5 times from -0.263 D (95% CI, -0.262 to -0.264) during normal period to -0.39 D (95% CI, -0.389 to -0.391) during COVID-19 quarantine (P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified grade rather than age was significantly associated with myopia (Hazard ratio [HR]: 1.10, 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.13; P < 0.001) and high myopia (HR: 1.40, 95% CI, 1.35 to 1.46; P < 0.001) after adjustment for other factors. The prevalence, progression, and incidence of myopia and high myopia could be categorized into two grade groups: I (grades 1-6) and II (grades 7-12). Specifically, COVID-19 quarantine for 6 months sufficiently increased risk of developing myopia (OR: 1.36, 95% CI, 1.33 to 1.40) or high myopia (OR: 1.30, 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.39) in Grade Group I, but decreased risk of developing myopia (OR: 0.45, 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.48) or high myopia (OR: 0.57, 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.59) in Grade Group II.

InterpretationThe finding that behavioral modifications for six months during COVID-19 quarantine sufficiently and grade-specifically modify myopia development offers the largest human behavioral intervention data at the one million scale to identify the grade-specific causal factors and effective prevention methods for guiding the formulation of myopia prevention and control policies.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSMyopia is the most-common refractive error worldwide. Myopia with younger onset may result in developing high myopia, which is associated with sight-threatening ocular diseases such as maculopathy, retinal detachment, opticneuropathy, glaucoma, retinal atrophy, choroidal neovascularization. In light of the increasing prevalence of myopia and high myopia has been a global public health concern, the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on myopia development has gained substantial attention. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and MEDLINE databases for original articles reported between database inception and November 10, 2020, using the following search terms: (coronavirus OR COVID* OR SARS-COV-2 OR lockdown OR quarantine) AND (myopia OR short-sightedness OR refractive error). To date, there was no original study reported to uncover the influence of COVID-19 quarantine on myopia progression.

Added value of this studyThis study provides the largest longitudinal intervention data on myopia progression in Chinese schoolchildren covering all grades of schoolchildren at one-million scale. COVID-19 quarantine model uncovers that behavioral modifications for six months may lead to significant increase of overall prevalence of myopia associated with their increased screen times and decreased outdoor activity times. Importantly, their effects on developing myopia or high myopia of students are grade-dependent, which were risk factors for elementary schools period but protective factors for high schools period partly due to reduced school education burden.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis one-million schoolchildren myopia survey offers evidence that six months behavioral modifications sufficiently and grade-specifically change the progression of myopia and high myopia. In view of the increased use of electronic devices is an unavoidable trend, effective myopia prevention strategy according to grade among students is urgently needed. Since COVID-19 outbreak is still ongoing and spreading, international collaborate efforts are warranted to uncover the influence of COVID-19 on myopia progression to further substantiate these findings.","Xu, L.; Ma, Y.; Yuan, J.; Zhang, Y.; Wang, H.; Zhang, G.; Tu, C.; Lu, X.; Li, J.; Xiong, Y.; Chen, F.; Liu, X.; Xue, Z.; Zhou, M.; Li, W.-Q.; Wu, N.; Chen, H.; Chen, J.; Lu, F.; Su, J.; Qu, J.",2020-11-18,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.11.15.20231936,1,Jia Qu,Wenzhou Medical University Eye Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.15.20231936v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.15.20231936v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
10150,A downscaling approach to compare COVID-19 count data from databases aggregated at different spatial scales,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten various regions around the world, obtaining accurate and reliable COVID-19 data is crucial for governments and local communities aiming at rigorously assessing the extent and magnitude of the virus spread and deploying efficient interventions. Using data reported between January and February 2020 in China, we compared counts of COVID-19 from near-real time spatially disaggregated data (city-level) with fine-spatial scale predictions from a Bayesian downscaling regression model applied to a reference province-level dataset. The results highlight discrepancies in the counts of coronavirus-infected cases at district level and identify districts that may require further investigation.","Python, A.; Bender, A.; Blangiardo, M.; Illian, J.

22891,The impact of varying class sizes on epidemic spread in a university population,"A common non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) during the Covid-19 pandemic has been group size limits. Further, educational settings of schools and universities have either fully closed or reduced their class sizes. As countries begin to reopen classrooms, a key question will be how large classes can be while still preventing local outbreaks of disease. Here we develop and analyse a simple, stochastic epidemiological model where individuals (considered as students) live in fixed households and are assigned to a fixed class for daily lessons. We compare key measures of the epidemic - the peak infected, the total infected by day 180 and the calculated R0 - as the size of class is varied. We find that class sizes of 10 could largely restrict outbreaks and often had overlapping inter-quartile ranges with our most cautious case of classes of 5. However, class sizes of 30 or more often result in large epidemics. Reducing the class size from 40 to 10 can reduce R0 by over 30%, as well as signficantly reducing the numbers infected. Intermediate class sizes show considerable variation, with the total infected varying by as much as from 10% to 80% for the same class size. We show that additional in-class NPIs can limit the epidemic still further, but that reducing class sizes appears to have a larger effect on the epidemic. We do not specifically tailor our model for Covid-19, but our results stress the importance of small class sizes for preventing large outbreaks of infectious disease.","Best, A.; Singh, P.; Ward, C.; Vitale, C.; Oliver, M.; Idris, L.; Poulston, A.",2021-04-22,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.02.26.21252501,2,Alex Best,University of Sheffield,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.26.21252501v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.26.21252501v2.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
4703,Faecal immunochemical testing (FIT): Sources of analytical variation based on three years of routine testing in the context of DG30,"AimsTo determine analytical capabilities of a commonly used faecal immunochemical test (FIT) to detect haemoglobin (Hb) in the context of NICE guidance DG30, and the likely use of FIT to reprioritise patients delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsData obtained from independent verification studies and clinical testing of the HM-JACKarc FIT method in routine primary care practice were analysed to derive analytical performance characteristics.

ResultsDetection capabilities for the FIT method were 0.5 {micro}g/g (limit of blank), 1.1 (limit of detection) and 15.0 {micro}g/g (limit of quantification). 31 of 33 (94%) non-homogenised specimens analysed in triplicate were consistently categorised relative to 10 {micro}g/g compared to all 33 (100%) homogenised specimens. Imprecision in non-homogenised specimens was higher (median 27.8%, (range 20.5% - 48.6%)) than in homogenised specimens (10.2%, (7.0 to 13.5%)). Considerable variation was observed in sequential clinical specimens from individual patients but no positive or negative trend in specimen degradation was observed (p=0.26).

ConclusionsThe FIT method is capable of detecting Hb at concentrations well below the DG30 threshold of 10 {micro}g/g. However, total imprecision is considerable when including sampling variation. Binary categorisation against a single defined threshold above and below 10 {micro}g/g was more consistent and improved following specimen homogenisation. This approach may be more appropriate when reporting results for symptomatic patients tested in primary care, including those who have had definitive investigation delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and need to be re-prioritised.

Key MessagesFaecal immunochemical testing (FIT) is increasingly used to detect blood at low haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations in specimens from symptomatic primary care patients but the analytical characteristics in this context have not been fully documented.

A commonly used FIT method showed good capability in a routine UK clinical setting to detect Hb at the NICE recommended threshold of 10{micro}g/g. Imprecision estimates were considerable when sampling was considered, even above the limit of quantification of 15 {micro}g/g.

Analytical variability appears too high for reliable reporting of quantitative Hb concentrations: reporting positive or negative results around a threshold of 10{micro}g/g appears more appropriate after sample homogenisation.

Dichotomous FIT reporting is likely to be an important tool to risk stratify patients with lower GI cancer symptoms who have had their test deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic","James, T.

DesignProspective national population-based cohort study using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS).

SettingAll 194 obstetric units in the UK

Participants427 pregnant women admitted to hospital with confirmed Sars-CoV-2 infection between 01/03/2020 and 14/04/2020. 694 comparison women who gave birth between 01/11/2017 and 31/10/2018.

Main outcome measuresIncidence of maternal hospitalisation, infant infection. Rates of maternal death, level 3 critical care unit admission, preterm birth, stillbirth, early neonatal death, perinatal death; odds ratios for infected versus comparison women.

ResultsEstimated incidence of hospitalisation with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy 4.9 per 1000 maternities (95%CI 4.5-5.4). The median gestation at symptom onset was 34 weeks (IQR 29-38). Black or other minority ethnicity (aOR 4.49, 95%CI 3.37-6.00), older maternal age (aOR 1.35, 95%CI 1.01-1.81 comparing women aged 35+ with those aged 30-34), overweight and obesity (aORs 1.91, 95%CI 1.37-2.68 and 2.20, 95%CI 1.56-3.10 respectively compared to women with a BMI<25kg/m2) and pre-existing comorbidities (aOR 1.52, 95%CI 1.12-2.06) were associated with admission with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. 247 women (58%) gave birth or had a pregnancy loss; 180 (73%) gave birth at term. 40 (9%) hospitalised women required respiratory support. Twelve infants (5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, six of these infants within the first 12 hours after birth.

ConclusionsThe majority of pregnant women hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 were in the late second or third trimester, supporting guidance for continued social distancing measures in later pregnancy. Most had good outcomes and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to infants was uncommon. The strong association between admission with infection and black or minority ethnicity requires urgent investigation and explanation.

6299,Functional alteration of innate T cells in critically ill Covid-19 patients,"Covid-19 can induce lung infection ranging from mild pneumonia to life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Dysregulated host immune response in the lung is a key feature in ARDS pathophysiology. However, cellular actors in Covid-19-driven ARDS are poorly understood. Here, we dynamically analyzed the biology of innate T cells, a heterogeneous class (MAIT, {gamma}{delta}T and iNKT cells) of T lymphocytes, presenting potent anti-infective and regulatory functions. Patients presented a compartmentalized lung inflammation paralleled with a limited systemic inflammation. Circulating innate T cells of critically ill Covid-19 patients presented a profound and persistent phenotypic and functional alteration. Highly activated innate T cells were detected in airways of patients suggesting a recruitment to the inflamed site and a potential contribution in the regulation of the local inflammation. Finally, the expression of the CD69 activation marker on blood iNKT and MAIT cells at inclusion was predictive of disease severity. Thus, patients present an altered innate T cell biology that may account for the dysregulated immune response observed in Covid-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Jouan, Y.; Guillon, A.; Gonzalez, L.; Perez, Y.; Ehrmann, S.; Ferreira, M.; Daix, T.; Jeannet, R.; Francois, B.; Dequin, P.-F.; Si-Tahar, M.; Baranek, T.; Paget, C.",2020-05-06,Intensive Care And Critical Care Medicine,10.1101/2020.05.03.20089300,1,Christophe Paget,Inserm U1100,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089300v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089300v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
21502,Evaluation of spike protein antigens for SARS-CoV-2 serology,"BackgroundSpike protein domains are being used in various serology-based assays to detect prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, there has been limited comparison of human antibody titers against various spike protein antigens among COVID-19 infected patients.

MethodsWe compared four spike proteins (RBD, S1, S2 and a stabilized spike trimer (ST)) representing commonly used antigens for their reactivity to human IgG antibodies using indirect ELISA in serum from COVID-19 patients and pre-2020 samples. ST ELISA was also compared against the EUROIMMUN IgG ELISA test. Further, we estimated time appropriate IgG and IgA seropositivity rates in COVID-19 patients using a panel of sera samples collected longitudinally from the day ofonset of symptoms (DOS).

ResultsAmong the four spike antigens tested, the ST demonstrated the highest sensitivity (86.2%; 95% CI: 77.8-91.7%), while all four antigens showed high specificity to COVID-19 sera (94.7-96.8%). 13.8% (13/94) of the samples did not show seroconversion in any of the four antigen-based assays. In a double-blinded head-to-head comparison, ST based IgG ELISA displayed a better sensitivity (87.5%, 95%CI: 76.4-93.8%) than the EUROIMMUN IgG ELISA (67.9%, 95% CI: 54.8-78.6%). Further, in ST-based assays, we found 48% and 50% seroconversion in the first six days (from DOS) for IgG and IgA antibodies, respectively, which increased to 84% (IgG) and 85% (IgA) for samples collected [&ge;]22 days DOS.

15781,"Onset, duration, and persistence of taste and smell changes and other COVID-19 symptoms: longitudinal study in Israeli patients","ObjectivesThe multifaceted manifestation of COVID-19 requires longitudinal characterization of symptoms, to aid with screening and disease management.

MethodsPhone interviews and follow-ups were completed with 112 mostly mild COVID-19 RT-PCR-positive adult patients, over a six-months period.

ResultsMore than one symptom at disease onset was experienced by [~]70% of the patients. About 40% of the patients experienced fever, dry cough, headache, or muscle ache as the first symptom. Fatigue, if reported, usually was the first to appear. Smell and taste changes were experienced 3.9 {+/-} 5.4 and 4.6 {+/-} 5.7 days (mean {+/-} SD) after disease onset and emerged as first symptom in 15% and 18% of patients, respectively. Fever had the shortest duration (5.8 {+/-} 8.6 days), and taste and smell changes were the longest-lasting symptoms (17.2 {+/-} 17.6 and 18.9 {+/-} 19.7 days, durations censored at 60 days). Longer smell recovery correlated with smell change severity. Cough, taste change and smell change persisted after negative RT-PCR tests (in 20%, 26% and 29% of the patients in total). At six-months follow-up, 46% of the patients had at least one unresolved symptom, most commonly fatigue (21%), chemosensory changes (14%) or breath difficulty (9%).

ConclusionsMore than one symptom typically occurred at disease onset. Chemosensory changes and cough persisted after negative RT-PCR in a quarter of the patients. Almost half of the patients reported at least one unresolved symptom at six-months follow up, mainly fatigue, smell changes and breath difficulty.

11162,Community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in England: Results from the ONS Coronavirus Infection Survey Pilot,"ObjectiveTo estimate the percentage of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) over time in the community in England and to quantify risk factors.

DesignRepeated cross-sectional surveys of population-representative households with longitudinal follow-up if consent given.

SettingEngland

Participants34,992 Individuals aged 2 years and over from 16,722 private residential households. Data were collected in a pilot phase of the survey between 26 April and 28 June 2020.

Main outcome measuresPercentage of individuals in the community testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using throat and nose swabs. Individuals were asked about any symptoms and potential risk factors.

ResultsThe percentage of people in private-residential households testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 reduced from 0.32% (95% credible interval (CrI) 0.19% to 0.52%) on 26 April to 0.08% (95% CrI 0.05% to 0.12%) on 28 June, although the prevalence stabilised near the end of the pilot. Factors associated with an increased risk of testing positive included having a job with direct patient contact (relative exposure (RE) 4.06, 95% CrI 2.42 to 6.77)), working outside the home (RE 2.49, 95% CrI 1.39 to 4.45), and having had contact with a hospital (RE 2.20, 95% CrI 1.09 to 4.16 for having been to a hospital individually and RE 1.95, 95% CrI 0.81 to 4.09 for a household member having been to a hospital). In 133 visits where individuals tested positive, 82 (61%, 95% CrI 53% to 69%) reported no symptoms, stably over time.

ConclusionThe percentage of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals declined between 26 April and 28 June 2020. Positive tests commonly occurred without symptoms being reported. Working outside your home was an important risk factor, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be essential for early detection of increases in infections following return to work and other relaxations of control measures.

What is already known on this topic- Unprecedented control measures, such as national lockdowns, have been widely implemented to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
- Previous mass surveillance has been based on data sources such as hospital admission, deaths or self-reported symptoms that do not measure community prevalence of virus directly.
- Decisions regarding the continued need for social distancing measures in the overall population, specific subgroups and geographic areas heavily rely on accurate and up-to-date information about the number of people and risk factors for testing positive.


What this study adds- The percentage of individuals from the general community in England testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 clearly declined between 26 April and 28 June 2020 from around one in three 300 to around one in a thousand.
- Risk factors for testing positive included having a job with direct patient contact, having had (indirect) contact with a hospital in the past 2 weeks, and working outside your home.
- Positive tests commonly occurred without symptoms being reported and the percentage of individuals with a positive test that reported no symptoms was stable over time.","Pouwels, K.

6175,Evaluating efficiency of pooling specimens for PCR-based detection of COVID-19,"In the age of a pandemic, such as the ongoing one caused by SARS-CoV-2, the world faces limited supply of tests, PPE and reagents, and factories are struggling to meet the growing demands. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of pooling specimen for testing of SARS-CoV-2 virus, to determine whether costs and resource savings could be achieved without impacting the sensitivity of the testing. Ten specimens were pooled for testing, containing either one or two known positive specimen of varying viral concentrations. Pooling specimens did not affect the sensitivity of detecting SARS-CoV-2, and the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) between testing of pooling specimen and subsequent individual testing was not significantly different using paired t-test. This study also identified cost savings garnered from pooling of specimen for testing at 4 differing prevalence rates, ranging from 0.1-10%. Pooling specimens to test for COVID-19 infection in low prevalence areas or in low risk population can dramatically decrease the resources burden on lab operations by up to 80%. This paves the possibility for large-scale population screening, allowing for assured policy decisions by governmental bodies to ease lockdown restrictions in areas with low incidence of infection, or with lower risk populations.","Wacharapluesadee, S.; Kaewpom, T.; Ampoot, W.; Ghai, S.; Khamhang, W.; Worachotsueptrakun, K.; Wanthong, P.; Nopvichai, C.; Supharatpariyakorn, T.; Putcharoen, O.; Paitoonpong, L.; Suwanpimolkul, G.; Jantarabenjakul, W.; Hemachudha, P.; Krichphiphat, A.; Buathong, R.; Plipat, T.; Hemachudha, T.",2020-05-06,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.02.20087221,1,Supaporn Wacharapluesadee,"Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Centre, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, K",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.02.20087221v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.02.20087221v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1002/jmv.26005
3671,Case fatality rate in COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundEstimating the prevalence of severe or critical illness and case fatality of COVID-19 outbreak in December, 2019 remains a challenge due to biases associated with surveillance, data synthesis and reporting. We aimed to address this limitation in a systematic review and meta-analysis and to examine the clinical, biochemical and radiological risk factors in a meta-regression.

MethodsPRISMA guidelines were followed. PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched using pre-specified keywords on March 07, 2020. Peer-reviewed empirical studies examining rates of severe illness, critical illness and case fatality among COVID-19 patients were examined. Numerators and denominators to compute the prevalence rates and risk factors were extracted. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed. Results were corrected for publication bias. Meta-regression analyses examined the moderator effects of potential risk factors.

ResultsThe meta-analysis included 29 studies representing 2,090 individuals. Pooled rates of severe illness, critical illness and case fatality among COVID-19 patients were 15%, 5% and 0.8% respectively. Adjusting for potential underreporting and publication bias, increased these estimates to 26%, 16% and 7.4% respectively. Increasing age and elevated LDH consistently predicted severe / critical disease and case fatality. Hypertension; fever and dyspnea at presentation; and elevated CRP predicted increased severity.

ConclusionsRisk factors that emerged in our analyses predicting severity and case fatality should inform clinicians to define endophenotypes possessing a greater risk. Estimated case fatality rate of 7.4% after correcting for publication bias underscores the importance of strict adherence to preventive measures, case detection, surveillance and reporting.","Kahathuduwa, C.

16060,"Evaluation of the accuracy, ease of use and limit of detection of novel, rapid, antigen-detecting point-of-care diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2","BackgroundReliable point-of-care (POC) diagnostics not requiring laboratory infrastructure could be a game changer in the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the Global South. We assessed performance, limit of detection and ease-of-use of three antigen-detecting, rapid POC tests (Ag-RDT) for SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsThis prospective, multi-centre diagnostic accuracy study recruited participants suspected to have SARS-CoV-2 in Germany and the UK. Paired nasopharyngeal swabs (NP) or NP and/or oropharyngeal swabs (OP) were collected from participants (one for clinical RT-PCR and one for Ag-RDT). Performance of each of three Ag-RDTs was compared to RT-PCR overall, and according to predefined subcategories e.g. cycle threshold (CT)-value, days from symptoms onset, etc. In addition, limited verification of the analytical limit-of-detection (LOD) was determined. To understand the usability a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire and ease-of-use (EoU) assessment were performed.

ResultsBetween April 17th and August 25th, 2020, 2417 participants were enrolled, with 70 (3.0%) testing positive by RT-PCR. The best-performing test (SD Biosensor, Inc. STANDARD Q) was 76x6% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 62x8-86x4) sensitive and 99x3% (CI 98x6-99x6) specific. A sub-analysis showed all samples with RT-PCR CT-values <25 were detectable by STANDARD Q. The test was considered easy-to-use (SUS 86/100) and suitable for POC. Bioeasy and Coris showed specificity of 93x1% (CI 91x0%-94x8%) and 95x8% (CI 93x4%-97x4%), respectively, not meeting the predefined target of [&ge;]98%.

ConclusionThere is large variability in performance of Ag-RDT with SD Biosensor showing promise. Given the usability at POC, this test is likely to have impact despite imperfect sensitivity; however further research and modelling are needed.","Krueger, L.

17598,Role of ivermectin in the prevention of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers in India: A matched case-control study,"BackgroundIvermectin is one among several potential drugs explored for its therapeutic and preventive role in COVID-19 infection. The study was aimed to explore the association between ivermectin prophylaxis and development of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers.

MethodsA hospital-based matched case-control study was conducted among healthcare workers of AIIMS Bhubaneswar, India, from September to October 2020. Profession, gender, age and date of diagnosis were matched for 186 case-control pairs. Cases and controls were healthcare workers who tested positive and negative, respectively, for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. Exposure was defined as the intake of ivermectin and/or hydroxychloroquine and/or vitamin-C and/or other prophylaxis for COVID-19. Data collection and entry was done in Epicollect5, and analysis was performed using STATA version 13. Conditional logistic regression models were used to describe the associated factors for COVID-19 infection.

ResultsIvermectin prophylaxis was taken by 77 controls and 38 cases. Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis (0.27, 95% CI, 0.15-0.51) was associated with 73% reduction of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers for the following one month, those who were involved in physical activity (3.06 95% CI, 1.18-7.93) for more than an hour/day were more likely to contract COVID-19 infection. Type of household, COVID duty, single-dose ivermectin prophylaxis, vitamin-C prophylaxis and hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis were not associated with COVID-19 infection.

ConclusionTwo-dose ivermectin prophylaxis at a dose of 300 g/kg with a gap of 72 hours was associated 73% reduction of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers for the following one-month.

5153,Estimating the burden of SARS-CoV-2 in France,"France has been heavily affected by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and went into lockdown on the 17th March 2020. Using models applied to hospital and death data, we estimate the impact of the lockdown and current population immunity. We find 2.6% of infected individuals are hospitalized and 0.53% die, ranging from 0.001% in those <20y to 8.3% in those >80y. Across all ages, men are more likely to be hospitalized, enter intensive care, and die than women. The lockdown reduced the reproductive number from 3.3 to 0.5 (84% reduction). By 11 May, when interventions are scheduled to be eased, we project 3.7 million (range: 2.3-6.7) people, 5.7% of the population, will have been infected.

1514,Estimated effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent international spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),"Traveller screening is being used to limit further global spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) following its recent emergence. Here, we project the impact of different travel screening programs given remaining uncertainty around the values of key nCoV life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected travellers. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. These findings emphasize the need for measures to track travellers who become ill after being missed by a travel screening program. We make our model available for interactive use so stakeholders can explore scenarios of interest using the most up-to-date information. We hope these findings contribute to evidence-based policy to combat the spread of nCoV, and to prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.","Gostic, K.; Gomez, A. C. R.; Mummah, R.

7811,P0: Progress to zero: A simple metric to measure COVID-19 progress by country/region,"The current COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating impact on the world. As of May 8th, 2020, more than half of the world is in lockdown, 3.6 million people have been infected, and over 250,000 of them have died. This is the first pandemic in human history that has been tracked on a daily basis across the world. Currently, progress is being tracked by a series of metrics, including new cases, deaths, and the effective reproduction number over time (R(t)), which epidemiologists have emphasized.

While it is an important measure, R(t) is not observable and is dependent on the absolute number of active cases; therefore, two geographies could have a similar R(t) but be having very different experiences. Here, we propose a metric to monitor progress on addressing the COVID pandemic that we name """"progress to zero"""" or P0. P0 corresponds to the percentage decline from a previously recorded peak level. The metric ranges from 0% (representing a geography that has not yet peaked) to 100% (representing a geography wherein 0 cases have been recorded for at least seven days). Our metric helps leaders focus on progress to a desired goal, easily can be tracked over time, can quickly identify retreat from progress, and is comparable across geographies regardless of their size.","Lavista Ferres, J.

19778,"Minimizing exposure to respiratory droplets, 'jet riders' and aerosols in air-conditioned hospital rooms by a 'Shield-and-Sink' strategy","ObjectivesIn COVID-19, transfer of respiratory materials transmits disease but the interplay of droplet and aerosol physics, physiology and environment is not fully understood. To advance understanding of disease transmission mechanisms and to find novel exposure minimization strategies, we studied cough-driven material transport modes and the efficacy of control strategies.

Design and methodsComputer simulations and real-world experiments were used for integrating an intensive care setting, multi- physics, and physiology. Patient-focused airflow management and air purification strategies were examined computationally and validated by submicron particle exhalation imaging in volunteers.

ResultsRespiratory materials ejected by cough exhibited four transport modes: long-distance ballistic, short- distance ballistic, """"jet rider"""", and aerosol modes. Interaction with air conditioning driven flow contaminated a hospital room rapidly. Different than large droplets or aerosols, """"jet rider"""" droplets travelled with the turbulent air jet initially, but fell out at a distance, were not well eliminated by air conditioning and exposed bystanders at larger distance and longer time; their size predisposes them to preferential capture in the nasal mucosa, the primordial COVID-19 infection site. """"Cough shields"""" captured large droplets but induced lateral dispersion of aerosols and jet riders. An air purification device alone had limited efficacy. A """"Shield and Sink"""" approach combining """"cough shields"""" with """"virus sinks"""" miminized exposure to all secretions in modeling and real-life experiments.

Conclusions""""Jet riders"""" have characteristics of highly efficient respiratory infection vectors and may play a role in Covid- 19 transmission. Exposure to all droplet types can be minimized through an easily implemented """"Shield and Sink"""" strategy.

6986,Rapid implementation of real-time SARS-CoV-2 sequencing to investigate healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections,"BackgroundThe burden and impact of healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections is unknown. We aimed to examine the utility of rapid sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 combined with detailed epidemiological analysis to investigate healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections and to inform infection control measures.

MethodsWe set up rapid viral sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from PCR-positive diagnostic samples using nanopore sequencing, enabling sample-to-sequence in less than 24 hours. We established a rapid review and reporting system with integration of genomic and epidemiological data to investigate suspected cases of healthcare-associated COVID-19.

ResultsBetween 13 March and 24 April 2020 we collected clinical data and samples from 5191 COVID-19 patients in the East of England. We sequenced 1000 samples, producing 747 complete viral genomes. We conducted combined epidemiological and genomic analysis of 299 patients at our hospital and identified 26 genomic clusters involving 114 patients. 66 cases (57.9%) had a strong epidemiological link and 15 cases (13.2%) had a plausible epidemiological link. These results were fed back to clinical, infection control and hospital management teams, resulting in infection control interventions and informing patient safety reporting.

ConclusionsWe established real-time genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in a UK hospital and demonstrated the benefit of combined genomic and epidemiological analysis for the investigation of healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections. This approach enabled us to detect cryptic transmission events and identify opportunities to target infection control interventions to reduce further healthcare-associated infections.","Meredith, L.

18556,Single cell profiling of COVID-19 patients: an international data resource from multiple tissues,"[Abstract]In late 2019 and through 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic swept the world, presenting both scientific and medical challenges associated with understanding and treating a previously unknown disease. To help address the need for great understanding of COVID-19, the scientific community mobilized and banded together rapidly to characterize SARS-CoV-2 infection, pathogenesis and its distinct disease trajectories. The urgency of COVID-19 provided a pressing use-case for leveraging relatively new tools, technologies, and nascent collaborative networks. Single-cell biology is one such example that has emerged over the last decade as a powerful approach that provides unprecedented resolution to the cellular and molecular underpinnings of biological processes. Early foundational work within the single-cell community, including the Human Cell Atlas, utilized published and unpublished data to characterize the putative target cells of SARS-CoV-2 sampled from diverse organs based on expression of the viral receptor ACE2 and associated entry factors TMPRSS2 and CTSL (Muus et al., 2020; Sungnak et al., 2020; Ziegler et al., 2020). This initial characterization of reference data provided an important foundation for framing infection and pathology in the airway as well as other organs. However, initial community analysis was limited to samples derived from uninfected donors and other previously-sampled disease indications. This report provides an overview of a single-cell data resource derived from samples from COVID-19 patients along with initial observations and guidance on data reuse and exploration.","Ballestar, E.; Farber, D.

10836,Identifying main and interaction effects of risk factors to predict intensive care admission in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study in Hong Kong,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic, placing significant burdens on the healthcare systems. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a machine learning approach incorporating hidden nonlinear interactions can improve prediction for Intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

MethodsConsecutive patients admitted to public hospitals between 1st January and 24th May 2020 in Hong Kong with COVID-19 diagnosed by RT-PCR were included. The primary endpoint was ICU admission.

ResultsThis study included 1043 patients (median age 35 (IQR: 32-37; 54% male). Nineteen patients were admitted to ICU (median hospital length of stay (LOS): 30 days, median ICU LOS: 16 days). ICU patients were more likely to be prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, anti-retroviral drugs lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir, ribavirin, steroids, interferon-beta and hydroxychloroquine. Significant predictors of ICU admission were older age, male sex, prior coronary artery disease, respiratory diseases, diabetes, hypertension and chronic kidney disease, and activated partial thromboplastin time, red cell count, white cell count, albumin and serum sodium. A tree-based machine learning model identified most informative characteristics and hidden interactions that can predict ICU admission. These were: low red cells with 1) male, 2) older age, 3) low albumin, 4) low sodium or 5) prolonged APTT. A five-fold cross validation confirms superior performance of this model over baseline models including XGBoost, LightGBM, random forests, and multivariate logistic regression.

ConclusionsA machine learning model including baseline risk factors and their hidden interactions can accurately predict ICU admission in COVID-19.","Zhou, J.; Tse, G.; Lee, S.; Liu, T.; Wu, W.

9065,HIGH LIVER FAT ASSOCIATES WITH HIGHER RISK OF DEVELOPING SYMPTOMATIC COVID-19 INFECTION - INITIAL UK BIOBANK OBSERVATIONS,"BackgroundA high proportion of COVID-19 patients develop acute liver dysfunction. Early research has suggested that pre-existing fatty liver disease may be a significant risk factor for hospitalisation. Liver fat, in particular, is a modifiable parameter and can be a target for public health policy and individual patient plans. In this study we aimed to assess pre-existing liver disease as a risk factor for developing symptomatic COVID-19.

MethodsFrom 502,506 participants from the UK Biobank, 42,146 underwent MRI (aged 45-82), and had measures of liver fat, liver fibroinflammatory disease and liver iron. Patients were censored on May 28th to determine how many had tested for COVID-19 with symptomatic disease. UK testing was restricted to those with symptoms in hospital. COVID-19 symptoms included fever, dry cough, sore throat, diarrhoea and fatigue. Univariate analysis was performed on liver phenotypic biomarkers to determine if these variables increased risk of symptomatic COVID-19, and compared to previously described risk factors associated with severe COVID-19, including to age, ethnicity, gender and obesity,

FindingsIncreased liver fat was associated with a higher risk for symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 in this population in univariate analysis(OR:1.85, p = 0.03). In obese participants, only those with concomitant fatty liver([&ge;]10%) were at increased risk(OR:2.96, p = 0.02), with those having normal liver fat (< 5%) showing no increased risk(OR:0.36, p = 0.09).

ConclusionsUK Biobank data demonstrated an association between pre-existing liver disease and obesity with severe COVID-19, with higher proportions of liver fat in obese individuals a likely risk factor for symptomatic disease and severity.

Public policy measures to protect patients with liver disease who may have almost double the risk of the general population should be considered, especially as dietary and pharmacological strategies to reduce body weight and liver fat already exist.

18635,Covid-19 pandemic lessons: Uncritical communication of test results can induce more harm than benefit and raises questions on standardized quality criteria for communication and liability,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic is characterized by both health and economic risks. A  safety loop model postulates risk-related decisions are not based on objective and measurable risks but on the subjective perception of those risks. We here illustrate a quantification of the difference between objective and subjective risks.

MethodThe objective risks (or chances) can be obtained from traditional 2 x 2 tables by calculating the positive (+LR) and negative (-LR) likelihood ratios. The subjective perception of objective risks is calculated from the same 2 x 2 tables by exchanging the X- and Y-axes. The traditional 2 x 2 table starts with the hypothesis, uses a test and a gold standard to confirm or exclude the investigated condition. The 2 x 2 table with inverted axes starts with the communication of a test result and presumes that the communication of bad news (whether right or false) will induce  perceived anxiety while good news will induce  perceived safety. Two different functions (confirmation and exclusion) of both perceptions (perceived anxiety and safety) can be quantified with those calculations.

ResultsThe analysis of six published tests and of one incompletely reported test on COVID-19 polymerase chain reactions (completed by four assumptions on high and low sensitivities and specificities) demonstrated that none of these tests induces  perceived safety. Eight of the ten tests confirmed the induction of perceived anxiety with +LRs (range 3.1 - 5900). In two of these eight tests a -LR (0.25 and 0.004) excluded the induction of perceived safety.

ConclusionsCommunication of test results caused perceived anxiety but not perceived safety in 80% of the investigated tests. Medical tests - whether right or false - generate strong psychological messages. In the case of COVID-19 tests may induce more perceived anxiety than safety.","Porzsolt, F.; Pfuhl, G.; Kaplan, R.

13073,Infection fatality risk for SARS-CoV-2: a nationwide seroepidemiological study in the non-institutionalized population of Spain,"ObjectiveTo estimate the range of the age- and sex-specific infection fatality risk (IFR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths and excess all-cause deaths.

DesignNationwide population-based seroepidemiological study combined with two national surveillance systems.

Setting and participantsNon-institutionalized Spanish population of all ages.

Main outcome measuresThe range of IFR was calculated as the observed number of COVID-19 deaths and excess deaths divided by the estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the non-institutionalized Spanish population. Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths were obtained from the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE) and excess all-cause deaths from the Monitoring Mortality System (MoMo) up to July 15, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infections were derived from the estimated seroprevalence by a chemiluminiscent microparticle immunoassay for IgG antibodies in 61,092 participants in the ENE-COVID nationwide serosurvey between April 27 and June 22, 2020.

ResultsThe overall IFR (95% confidence interval) was 0.8% (0.8% to 0.9%) for confirmed COVID-19 deaths and 1.1% (1.0% to 1.2%) for excess deaths. The IFR ranged between 1.1% (1.0% to 1.2%) and 1.4% (1.3% to 1.5%) in men and between 0.6% (0.5% to 0.6%) and 0.8% (0.7% to 0.8%) in women. The IFR increased sharply after age 50, ranging between 11.6% (8.1% to 16.5%) and 16.4% (11.4% to 23.2%) in men [&ge;]80 years and between 4.6% (3.4% to 6.3%) and 6.5% (4.7% to 8.8%) in women [&ge;]80 years.

ConclusionThe sharp increase in SARS-CoV-2 IFR after age 50 was more marked in men than in women. Fatality from COVID-19 is substantially greater than that reported for other common respiratory diseases such as seasonal influenza.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICInfection fatality risk (IFR) for SARS-CoV-2 is a key indicator for policy decision making, but its magnitude remains under debate. Case fatality risk, which accounts for deaths among confirmed COVID-19 cases, overestimates SARS-CoV-2 fatality as it excludes a large proportion of asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic infections. Population-based seroepidemiological studies are a valuable tool to properly estimate the number of infected individuals, regardless of symptoms. Also, because ascertainment of deaths due to COVID-19 is often incomplete, the calculation of the IFR should be complemented with data on excess all-cause mortality. In addition, data on age- and sex-specific IFR are scarce, even though age and sex are well known modifiers of the clinical evolution of COVID-19.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSUsing the ENE-COVID nationwide serosurvey and two national surveillance systems in Spain, this study provides a range of age- and sex-specific IFR estimates for SARS-CoV-2 based on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths and excess all-cause deaths. The risk of death was very low among infected individuals younger than 50 years, but it increased sharply with age, particularly among men. In the oldest age group ([&ge;]80 years), it was estimated that 12% to 16% of infected men and 5% to 6% of infected women died during the first epidemic wave.","Pastor-Barriuso, R.; Perez-Gomez, B.; Hernan, M.

5364,"Resident physician exposure to novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV-2) within New York City during exponential phase of COVID-19 pandemic: Report of the New York City Residency Program Directors COVID-19 Research Group","BackgroundFrom March 2-April 12, 2020, New York City (NYC) experienced exponential growth of the COVID-19 pandemic due to novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Little is known regarding how physicians have been affected. We aimed to characterize COVID-19 impact on NYC resident physicians.

MethodsIRB-exempt and expedited cross-sectional analysis through survey to NYC residency program directors (PDs) April 3-12, 2020, encompassing events from March 2-April 12, 2020.

FindingsFrom an estimated 340 residency programs around NYC, recruitment yielded 91 responses, representing 24 specialties and 2,306 residents. 45.1% of programs reported at least one resident with confirmed COVID-19: 101 resident physicians were confirmed COVID-19-positive, with additional 163 residents presumed positive for COVID-19 based on symptoms but awaiting or unable to obtain testing. 56.5% of programs had a resident waiting for, or unable to obtain, COVID-19 testing. Two COVID-19-positive residents were hospitalized, with one in intensive care. Among specialties with >100 residents represented, negative binomial regression indicated that infection risk differed by specialty (p=0.039). Although most programs (80%) reported quarantining a resident, with 16.8% of residents experiencing quarantine, 14.9% of COVID-19-positive residents were not quarantined. 90 programs, encompassing 99.2% of the resident physicians, reported reuse or extended mask use, and 43 programs, encompassing 60.4% of residents, felt that personal protective equipment (PPE) was suboptimal. 65 programs (74.7%) have redeployed residents elsewhere to support COVID-19 efforts.

InterpretationMany resident physicians around NYC have been affected by COVID-19 through direct infection, quarantine, or redeployment. Lack of access to testing and concern regarding suboptimal PPE are common among residency programs. Infection risk may differ by specialty.

13614,"Evidence and magnitude of seasonality in SARS-CoV-2 transmission: Penny wise, pandemic foolish?","ImportanceIntensity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and planning required to balance concerns of saving lives and avoiding economic collapse, could depend significantly on whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission is sensitive to seasonal changes.

ObjectiveHypothesis is that increasing temperature results in reduced SARS CoV-2 transmission and may help slow the increase of cases over time.

SettingFifty representative Northern Hemisphere countries meeting specific criteria had sufficient COVID-19 case and meteorological data for analysis.

MethodsRegression was used to find relationship between the log of number of COVID-19 cases and temperature over time in 50 representative countries. To summarize the day-day variability, and reduce dimensionality, we selected a robust measure, Coefficient of Time (CT), for each location. The resulting regression coefficients were then used in a multivariable regression against meteorological, country-level and demographic covariates.

ResultsMedian minimum daily temperature showed the strongest correlation with the reciprocal of CT (which can be considered as a rate associated with doubling time) for confirmed cases (adjusted R2 = 0.610, p = 1.45E-06). A similar correlation was found using median daily dewpoint, which was highly colinear with temperature, and therefore was not used in the analysis. The correlation between minimum median temperature and the rate of increase of the log of confirmed cases was 47% and 45% greater than for cases of death and recovered cases of COVID-19, respectively. This suggests the primary influence of temperature on SARS-CoV2 transmission more than COVID-19 morbidity. Based on the correlation between temperature and the rate of increase in COVID-19, it can be estimated that, between the range of 30 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a one degree increase leads to a 1% decrease--and a one degree decrease leads to a 3.7% increase--in the rate of increase of the log of daily confirmed cases.

ConclusionThe results suggest that boreal summer months are associated with slower rates of COVID-19 transmission, with the reverse true in winter months. Knowledge of COVID-19 seasonality could prove useful in local planning for phased reductions social interventions and help to prepare for the timing of possible pandemic resurgence during cooler months.","Kaplin, A.

14577,"Decontaminating N95 respirators during the Covid-19 pandemic: simple and practical approaches to increase decontamination capacity, speed, safety and ease of use.","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a severe shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), especially N95 respirators. Efficient, effective and economically feasible methods for large-scale PPE decontamination are urgently needed.

Aims(1) to develop protocols for effectively decontaminating PPE using vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP); (2) to develop novel approaches that decrease set up and take down time while also increasing decontamination capacity (3) to test decontamination efficiency for N95 respirators heavily contaminated by makeup or moisturizers.

MethodsWe converted a decommissioned Biosafety Level 3 laboratory into a facility that could be used to decontaminate N95 respirators. N95 respirators were hung on metal racks, stacked in piles, placed in paper bags or covered with makeup or moisturizer. A VHP(R)VICTORYTM unit from STERIS was used to inject VHP into the facility. Biological and chemical indicators were used to validate the decontamination process.

FindingsN95 respirators individually hung on metal racks were successfully decontaminated using VHP. N95 respirators were also successfully decontaminated when placed in closed paper bags or if stacked in piles of up to six. Stacking reduced the time needed to arrange N95 respirators for decontamination by approximately two-thirds while almost tripling facility capacity. Makeup and moisturizer creams did not interfere with the decontamination process.

ConclusionsRespirator stacking can reduce the hands-on time and increase decontamination capacity. When personalization is needed, respirators can be decontaminated in labeled paper bags. Make up or moisturizers do not appear to interfere with VHP decontamination.","Russo, R.; Levine, C.; Veilleux, C.; Peixoto, B.; Mccormick-Ell, J.; Block, T.; Gresko, A.; Delmas, G.; Chitale, P.; Frees, A.; Ruiz, A.; Alland, D.",2020-08-21,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.08.17.20177022,1,Riccardo Russo,"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20177022v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20177022v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.jhin.2020.12.006
16099,COVID-19 Outbreaks in Refugee Camps. A simulation study.,"1We built a mathematical model for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and analyze it using both a deterministic and a stochastic approach. We used this model to project the burden of the disease in refugee camps characterized by peculiar demographic characteristics and a high level of deprivation, including lack of medical facilities and personnel, as well as limited possibility to implement containment and quarantine measures. Most of the parameters in our model were adapted from published literature but we used our own estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0 as well as the lethality by age group and gender. We projected the burden in terms of number of infections, number of deaths and number of bed-days in hospitalization and intensive care, among others. We conclude that the harsh conditions of refugee camps combined with a high share of young people leads to a relatively mild scenario for the burden of the disease.","Hernandez-Suarez, C.

18514,COVID-19: how the pandemic impacted the emergency department and urgent surgical activity in a medium-size Italian hospital.,"BackgroundsCOVID-19 has grown rapidly in Lombardy, particularly in the province of Bergamo. To deal with the pressure the pandemic has exerted on the Italian health system; many hospitals have had to reorganize their medical and surgical activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate how the pandemic influenced the emergency department and urgent surgical activity in a medium-size hospital in the province of Bergamo.

MethodsIn this retrospective observational study, we analyzed the number of admissions to the medical and surgical Emergency Room and their severity compared with those in the same period in previous years (2011-2019). Admission in the medical and surgical department and urgent surgical operation was also assessed.

ResultsFrom March 7th to April 5th, 2020, we observe a reduction in emergency department access (-53%) when compared with the corresponding period of previous years. The number of medical admissions was similar to the past years (+0.9%), we observed a drastic reduction of surgical patients (-82.5%). We experienced a significant increase in hospitalizations in the medical department (+359%) and a reduction of admission in the surgical department (-71.2%).

ConclusionSARS-CoV2 disease has spread so suddenly and severely that it has stressed Italian health system, in particular the Lombard one. Our data show the rise of critical medical ER accesses and the significant expansion in hospitalisation in the medical department with the necessary hospital reorganisation to face COVID-19 emergency. We also observed a reduction in both surgical ER accesses and urgent surgical activity.","Pinotti, E.; Carissimi, F.; Baronio, G.; Montuori, M.; Ongaro, D.; Ciocca Vasino, M.",2020-11-20,Surgery,10.1101/2020.11.19.20234856,1,Enrico Pinotti,Policlinico San Pietro,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.19.20234856v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.19.20234856v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
9115,Multicenter point-prevalence evaluation of the utilization and safety of drug therapies for COVID-19,"BackgroundThere are currently no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of COVID-19. At the onset of the pandemic, off-label medication use was supported by limited or no clinical data. We sought to characterize experimental COVID-19 therapies and identify safety signals during this period.

MethodsWe conducted a non-interventional, multicenter, point prevalence study of patients hospitalized with suspected/confirmed COVID-19. Clinical and treatment characteristics within a 24-hour window were evaluated in a random sample of up to 30 patients per site. The primary objective was to describe COVID-19 targeted therapies. The secondary objective was to describe adverse drug reactions (ADRs).

ResultsA total of 352 patients from 15 US hospitals were included. Most patients were treated at academic medical centers (53.4%) or community hospitals (42.6%). Sixty-seven patients (19%) were receiving drug therapy in addition to supportive care. Drug therapies included hydroxychloroquine (69%), remdesivir (10%), and interleukin-6 inhibitors (9%). Five patients (7.5%) were receiving combination therapy. Patients with a history of asthma (14.9% vs. 7%, p = 0.037) and those enrolled in clinical trials (26.9% vs.

3.2%, p< 0.001) were more likely to receive therapy. Among those receiving COVID-19 therapy, eight patients (12%) experienced an ADR, and ADRs were more commonly recognized in patients enrolled in clinical trials (62.5% vs 22%, OR = 5.9, p = 0.028).

ConclusionsWhile we observed high rates of supportive care for patients with COVID-19, we also found that ADRs were common among patients receiving drug therapy including in clinical trials. Comprehensive systems are needed to identify and mitigate ADRs associated with experimental COVID-19 therapies.","Rhodes, N. J.; Dairem, A.; Moore, W.; Shah, A.; Postelnick, M. J.; Badowski, M.

23199,"Measuring the exposure of Black, Asian and other ethnic groups to Covid-infected neighbourhoods in English towns and cities","Drawing on the work of The Doreen Lawrence Review - a report on the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities in the UK - this paper develops an index of exposure, measuring which ethnic groups have been most exposed to Covid-19 infected residential neighbourhoods during the first and second waves of the pandemic in England. The index is based on a Bayesian Poisson model with a random intercept in the linear predictor, allowing for extra-Poisson variation at neighbourhood and town/city scales. This permits within-city differences to be decoupled from broader regional trends in the disease. The research finds that members of ethnic minority groups tend to be living in areas with higher infection rates but also that the risk of exposure is distributed unevenly across these groups. Initially, in the first wave, the disease disproportionately affected Black residents. As the pandemic has progressed, especially the Pakistani but also the Bangladeshi and Indian groups have had the highest exposure. This higher exposure of the Pakistani group is not straightforwardly a function of neighbourhood deprivation because it is present across a range of average house prices. However, we find evidence to support the view, expressed in The Doreen Lawrence Review, that it is linked to occupational and environmental exposure, particularly residential density.","Harris, R.; Brunsdon, C.",2021-03-08,Occupational And Environmental Health,10.1101/2021.03.04.21252893,1,Richard Harris,University of Bristol,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.04.21252893v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.04.21252893v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
17547,Feasibility of collecting and processing of COVID-19 convalescent plasma for treatment of COVID-19 in Uganda,"IntroductionEvidence that supports the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) for treatment of COVID-19 is increasingly emerging. However, very few African countries have undertaken the collection and processing of CCP. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of collecting and processing of CCP, in preparation for a randomized clinical trial of CCP for treatment of COVID-19 in Uganda.

MethodsIn a cross-sectional study, persons with documented evidence of recovery from COVID-19 in Uganda were contacted and screened for blood donation via telephone calls. Those found eligible were asked to come to the blood donation centre for further screening and consent. Whole blood collection was undertaken from which plasma was processed. Plasma was tested for transfusion transmissible infections (TTIs) and anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody titers. SARS-CoV-2 testing was also done on nasopharyngeal swabs from the donors.

Results192 participants were contacted of whom 179 (93.2%) were eligible to donate. Of the 179 eligible, 23 (12.8%) were not willing to donate and reasons given included: having no time 7(30.4%), fear of being retained at the COVID-19 treatment center 10 (43.5%), fear of stigma in the community 1 (4.3%), phobia for donating blood 1 (4.3%), religious issues 1 (4.4%), lack of interest 2 (8.7%) and transport challenges 1 (4.3%). The median age was 30 years and females accounted for 3.7% of the donors. A total of 30 (18.5%) donors tested positive for different TTIs. Antibody titer testing demonstrated titers of more than 1:320 for all the 72 samples tested. Age greater than 46 years and female gender were associated with higher titers though not statistically significant.

ConclusionCCP collection and processing is possible in Uganda. However, concerns about stigma and lack of time, interest or transport need to be addressed in order to maximize donations.","Muttamba, W.; Lusiba, J.; Namakula, O. L.; Kibwika, P.

23543,Evolution of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 over seven months: experience of the Nationwide Seroprevalence ENE-COVID Study in Spain,"ObjectivesTo analyse temporal trends in SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid IgG throughout the four rounds of the nationwide seroepidemiologic study ENE-COVID (April-November 2020), and to compare the fourth-round results of two immunoassays detecting antibodies against nucleocapsid and to S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD).

MethodsA chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) was offered to all participants in the first three rounds (Abbott; anti-nucleocapsid IgG). In the fourth round we offered this test and a chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) (Beckman; anti-RBD IgG) to i) a randomly selected sub-cohort, ii) participants who were IgG-positive in any of the three first rounds; and iii) participants who were IgG-positive in the fourth round by point-of-care immunochromatography.

ResultsImmunoassays involving 10,153 participants (82.2% of people invited to donate samples) were performed in the fourth round. A total of 2595 participants (35.1% of participants with immunoassay results in the four rounds) were positive for anti-nucleocapsid IgG in at least one round. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG became undetectable in 43.3% of participants with positive first-round results. Pneumonia was more frequent in participants with anti-nucleocapsid IgG in all four rounds (11.2%) than those in which IgG became undetectable (2.4%).

In fourth round, anti-nucleocapsid and anti-RBD IgG were detected in 5.5% and 5.4% participants of the randomly selected sub-cohort, and in 26.6% and 25.9% participants with at least one previous positive result, respectively. Agreement between techniques was 90.3% (kappa: 0.72).

18754,"N95 respirators, disposable procedure masks and reusable cloth face coverings: total inward leakage and filtration efficiency of materials against aerosol","Humans expel physiological particles continuously through normal respiratory activities such as breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing; a portion of these are aerosol in the size range <5.0 {micro}m. Misconceptions exist on how to best implement face coverings as an effective preventive health measure against potentially infectious respiratory generated aerosol. The aim of this study was to characterise the performance of face coverings against aerosol when worn by individuals, and to quantify the maximum aerosol penetration through the material used in the construction of each mask. The former addresses their use as a means of possible protection against aerosol present in the environment and the latter having relevance to filtration and reducing human generated aerosol from reaching the environment. Face covering performance was assessed by measuring the total inward leakage of aerosol through the mask material and face seal. Aerosol penetration was measured on swatches of material taken from the face covering. An inert polydisperse charge-neutralized NaCl aerosol, with a distribution ranging from 0.023 {micro}m to 5 m in diameter, was used for the experiments.

Total inward leakage tests were completed to assess the protection factor for nine variations of face coverings, including seven reusable cloth masks, of which six were homemade and one was commercially manufactured, and two styles of disposable procedure masks, one with ear loops and one with ties. Our results have shown that face coverings in general provide the wearer only limited protection against aerosol in the environment. All reusable cloth face coverings obtained a practical protection level of less than 2. The performance of the disposable procedure masks varied from 1.7 to 3.6. The mean practical protection level for the nine face coverings was 1.95 with a standard deviation of 0.89. Comparatively, a N95 respirator achieved a protection factor of 166. We have further shown that aerosol readily penetrates through most materials used in face coverings. Aerosol swatch penetration tests were completed on six different fabrics commonly available for reusable homemade face coverings, four different material systems comprised of multiple material types, eight different disposable procedure masks and the filtering material from three different N95 respirators. Maximum aerosol penetration through the six common fabrics varied from 39% to 91%; for systems comprised of multiple types of materials 4% to 23%; for materials used in disposable procedure masks 16% to 80%; and for filtering materials used in N95 respirators 1.0% to 1.9%. We also highlight that with the exception of some of the reusable cloth materials, penetration of particulates at 5 {micro}m diameter, representing the minimum filtration efficiency that could be achieved against droplets, was insignificant; the six common fabrics showed penetration from 1% to 44%; the fabric systems comprised of multiple types of materials <0.9%; the materials used in disposable procedure masks <0.9% to 6%; and the filtering materials used in three different N95 respirators <0.9%. The observations from this study directly demonstrate that face coverings may be optimized by incorporating high filtration efficiency materials in their construction. Face coverings with an enhanced level of filtration would be of benefit in circumstances where SARS-CoV-2 may be present in the aerosol of infected individuals to reduce aerosol emission from respiratory activities penetrating through into the environment.","Duncan, S.; Bodurtha, P.

24434,Efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma and intravenous immunoglobulin in critically ill COVID-19 patients. A controlled clinical trial.,"BackgroundThe proportion of critically ill COVID-19 patients has collapsed hospital care worldwide. The need for alternative therapies for this group of patients is imperative. This study aims to compare the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) compared with human immunoglobulin (IVIg) in patients requiring the administration of high oxygen levels or mechanical ventilation.

MethodsThis is a controlled, randomized, open clinical trial of patients with pneumonia secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection, that fulfilled criteria for severe or critical disease. They were randomized in a 1:2 ratio; group 1 was administered IVIg at a dose of 0.3 grams per kilogram of ideal weight, in an 8-hour infusion every 24 hours, for 5 days. Group 2 was administered 200 ml of CP infused in 2 hours, for 2 days. The primary outcomes were duration of hospitalization and mortality at 28 days.

ResultsOne hundred and ninety (190) patients were randomized; 130 to the CP group, and 60 to the IVIg group. Their average age was 58 years (IQR 47 - 72), and most were male (n= 119, 62.6 %). On inclusion, 85.2 % of patients (n=162) were on invasive mechanical ventilation therapy. Overall mortality in all included patients was 53 % (n= 102), with a median follow-up of 14 days (IQI 8 - 26). Mortality at 28 days was 45.2 % (n=86). In the intention-to-treat analysis, there was no difference between groups neither in mortality on follow-up (53.8 vs. 53.3, p =1.0) nor at 28 days (46.2 vs 43 %, p=0.75, Log Rank p = 0.83). Per-protocol analysis between treatment groups revealed no difference in mortality throughout hospitalization (51.5 vs 51.4 %, p=1.0) nor after 28 days (42.1 vs 42.87 %, p=0.92 Log Rank p = 0.54). Only 23 patients in the CP group received plasma with detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

ConclusionsIn critically ill patients or on invasive mechanical ventilation for treatment of Covid-19, the use of CP is not superior to IVIg in terms of hospitalization duration or mortality. The use of CP is based on complex logistics and requires an assured level of antibodies if used therapeutically. IVIg does not appear to be useful in this group of patients.

19048,Predictive accuracy of computer-aided versions of the on-admission National Early Warning Score in estimating the risk of COVID-19 for unplanned admission to hospital: a retrospective development and validation study,"ObjectivesTo consider the potential of the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) for COVID-19 risk prediction on unplanned admission to hospital.

DesignLogistic regression model development and validation study using a cohort of unplanned emergency medical admission to hospital.

SettingYork Hospital (YH) as model development dataset and Scarborough Hospital (SH) as model validation dataset.

ParticipantsUnplanned adult medical admissions discharged over 3 months (11 March 2020 to 13 June 2020) from two hospitals (YH for model development; SH for external model validation) based on admission NEWS2 electronically recorded within {+/-}24 hours of admission. We used logistic regression modelling to predict the risk of COVID-19 using NEWS2 (Model M0) versus enhanced cNEWS models which included age + sex (model M1) + subcomponents (including diastolic blood pressure + oxygen flow rate + oxygen scale) of NEWS2 (model M2). The ICD-10 code  U071 was used to identify COVID-19 admissions. Model performance was evaluated according to discrimination (c statistic), calibration (graphically), and clinical usefulness at NEWS2 [&ge;]5.

ResultsThe prevalence of COVID-19 was higher in SH (11.0%=277/2520) than YH (8.7%=343/3924) with higher index NEWS2 (3.2 vs 2.8) but similar in-hospital mortality (8.4% vs 8.2%). The c-statistics for predicting COVID-19 for cNEWS models (M1,M2) was substantially better than NEWS2 alone (M0) in development (M2: 0.78 (95%CI 0.75-0.80) vs M0 0.71 (95%CI 0.68-0.74)) and validation datasets (M2: 0.72 (95%CI 0.69-0.75) vs M0 0.65 (95%CI 0.61-0.68)). Model M2 had better calibration than Model M0 with improved sensitivity (M2: 57% (95%CI 51%-63%) vs M0 44% (95%CI 38%-50%)) and similar specificity (M2: 76% (95%CI 74%-78%) vs M0 75% (95%CI 73%-77%)) for validation dataset at NEWS2[&ge;]5.

ConclusionsModel M2 is reasonably accurate for predicting the on-admission risk of COVID-19. It may be clinically useful for an early warning system at the time of admission especially to triage large numbers of unplanned hospital admissions.","Faisal, M.; Mohammed, M.

9951,"Epidemiological characteristics of patients with residual SARS-Cov-2 in Linyi, China","Patients with 2019 novel Coronavirus infection are probably show positive testing results again. In order to better treat these patients and provide basis for further control measures, we analyze the epidemiological outcomes and clinical features of patients with residual Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) in Linyi city. From January 23 to March 31 in 2020, epidemiological and clinical information of confirmed patients are collected for analysis. Stool and pharyngeal swab samples are collected for RT-PCR testing. 64 confirmed patients are included and 17 patients present re-positive testing after discharge. For these 17 patients, 70.59% are family aggregated, the interval between first time of negative testing and first time of re-positive testing is 11.82{+/-}3.42 days. There is no difference between patients with continued negative testing results and re-positive testing. After discharge, the interval between first time of negative testing and first time of re-positive testing is associated with severity of disease (p=0.013). Besides, the duration from first time to last time of re-positive testing is associated with exposure or contact history (p=0.049) and severity of disease (p=0.001).

22763,Epidemiological and Genomic analysis of a Sydney Hospital COVID-19 Outbreak,"Australias early COVID-19 experience involved clusters in northern Sydney, including hospital and aged-care facility (ACF) outbreaks. We explore transmission dynamics, drivers and outcomes of a metropolitan hospital COVID-19 outbreak that occurred in the context of established local community transmission. A retrospective cohort analysis is presented, with integration of viral genome sequencing, clinical and epidemiological data. We demonstrate using genomic epidemiology that the hospital outbreak (n=23) was linked to a concurrent outbreak at a local aged care facility, but was phylogenetically distinct from other community clusters. Thirty day survival was 50% for hospitalised patients (an elderly cohort with significant comorbidities) and 100% for staff. Staff who acquired infection were unable to attend work for a median of 26.5 days (range 14-191); an additional 140 staff were furloughed for quarantine. Transmission from index cases showed a wide dispersion (mean 3.5 persons infected for every patient case and 0.6 persons infected for every staff case). One patient, who received regular nebulised medication prior to their diagnosis being known, acted as an apparent superspreader. No secondary transmissions occurred from isolated cases or contacts who were quarantined prior to becoming infectious. This analysis elaborates the wide-ranging impacts on patients and staff of nosocomial COVID-19 transmission and highlights the utility of genomic analysis as an adjunct to traditional epidemiological investigations. Delayed case recognition resulted in nosocomial transmission but once recognised, prompt action by the outbreak management team and isolation with contact and droplet (without airborne) precautions were sufficient to prevent transmission within this cohort. Our findings support current PPE recommendations in Australia but demonstrate the risk of administering nebulised medications when COVID-19 is circulating locally.","Tennant, E.; Figtree, M.; Tallon, J.; Bull, R.; Yeung, M.; Deveson, I.

6043,A Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model of COVID-19 epidemic trend in Malaysia under Movement Control Order (MCO) using a data fitting approach,"BackgroundIn this work, we presented a Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemiological model of COVID-19 epidemic in Malaysia post- and pre-Movement Control Order (MCO). The proposed SIR model was fitted to confirmed COVID-19 cases from the official press statements to closely reflect the observed epidemic trend in Malaysia. The proposed model is aimed to provide an accurate predictive information for decision makers in assessing the public health and social measures related to COVID-19 epidemic.

MethodsThe SIR model was fitted to the data by minimizing a weighted loss function; the sum of the residual sum of squares (RSS) of infected, removed and total cases. Optimized beta ({beta}),), gamma ({gamma}) parameter values) parameter values and the starting value of susceptible individuals (N) were obtained.

ResultsThe SIR model post-MCO indicates the peak of infection on 10 April 2020, less than 100 active cases by 8 July 2020, less than 10 active cases by 29 August 2020, and close to zero daily new case by 22 July 2020, with a total of 6562 infected cases. In the absence of MCO, the model predicts the peak of infection on 1 May 2020, less than 100 active cases by 14 February 2021, less than 10 active cases by 26 April 2021 and close to zero daily new case by 6 October 2020, with a total of 1.6 million infected cases. Conclusion: The results suggest that the present MCO has significantly reduced the number of susceptible population and the total number of infected cases. The method to fit the SIR model used in this study was found to be accurate in reflecting the observed data. The method can be used to predict the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in other countries.","Arifin, W. N.; Chan, W. H.; Amaran, S.; Musa, K.

3399,Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19 and Impact on Public Health Policy,"In this work we construct a mathematical model for the transmission and spread of coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19. Our model features delay terms to account for (a) the time lapse or latency period between contracting the disease and displaying symptoms, and (b) the time lag in testing patients for the virus due to the limited numbers of testing facilities currently available. We find that the delay introduces a significant disparity between the actual and reported time-trajectories of cases in a particular region. Specifically, the reported case histories lag the actual histories by a few days. Hence, to minimize the spread of the disease, lockdowns and similarly drastic social isolation measures need to be imposed some time before the reported figures are approaching their peak values. We then account for the social reality that lockdowns can only be of a limited duration in view of practical considerations. We find that the most effective interval for imposing such a limited-time lockdown is one where the midpoint of the lockdown period coincides with the actual peak of the spread of the disease in the absence of the lockdown. We further show that the true effectivity of imposing a lockdown may be misrepresented and grossly underestimated by the reported case trajectories in the days following the action.","Shayak, B.; Sharma, M.

Fears were raised higher, effective policies for prevention and control were concerned.

MethodsTill March 3, 91273 confirmed COVID-19 cases were included in. Using Mann-Whitney U test, the provinces that reported the life tracks of confirmed cases to public had lower increased in daily new confirmed cases.

ResultsCompared with the paired province, Tianjin, Jilin, Gansu, Shanxi, Hainan and Guizhou had significant differences in the number of new confirmed cases and have lower mean rank (P<0.05). Shanghai had a lower mean rank (P=0.175) but no significant difference. Besides, the successful prevention and control work need other effective strategies, such as real time media coverage, isolating the suspected cases or close contacts, delaying the return of work, closing schools, wearing facial masks, and disinfecting the communities, et.al.

ConclusionsStrategies must be adjusted in real time according to the epidemic. Reporting the life tracks of confirmed cases was an effective way to control the epidemic.

We use a survey experiment to examine the prevalence of non-compliance with social distancing in nine countries and test pre-registered hypotheses about individual-level characteristics associated with less social distancing. Leveraging a list experiment to control for social desirability bias, we find large cross-national variation in adherence to social distancing guidelines. Compliance varies systematically with COVID-19 fatalities and the strictness of lockdown measures. We also find substantial heterogeneity in the role of individual-level predictors. While there is an ideological gap in social distancing in the US and New Zealand, this is not the case in European countries. Taken together, our results suggest caution when trying to model pandemic health policies on other countries experiences.

Here we evaluate the efficacy of ozone treatment over bacterial strains and virus-like particles.

MethodA preparation of a lentiviral vector (lentivector) and dried cultures of two bacterial strains (gram + Staphylococcus aureus and gram - Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis) were placed inside an ambulance at two different locations. The interior of the vehicle was subjected to 10 min and 20 min treatments (3 and 6 times the recommended time by the manufacturer). Following the treatments, lentivector preparations were titrated, and viable bacteria (colony forming units, CFUs) counted and compared to pre-treatment titers and infectious CFUs of the same lysates and cultures.

ResultsNone of the treatments significantly reduced either lentivector titer or the number of viable bacteria.

ConclusionsAt least in the analyzed conditions and for the microorganisms used in this study, it can be concluded that ozone treatment is not advisable for the disinfection of emergency vehicles.","Biurrun, J.; Garcia, B.; Perez, A.; Kochan, G.; Escors, D.; Crespo, J.; Lasa, I.; Echarri, A.",2020-05-26,Emergency Medicine,10.1101/2020.05.24.20111666,1,David Escors,Navarrabiomed,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.24.20111666v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.24.20111666v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
24862,Convalescent Plasma Use in the United States was inversely correlated with COVID-19 Mortality: Did Convalescent Plasma Hesitancy cost lives?,"BackgroundThe US Food and Drug Administration authorized Convalescent Plasma (CCP) therapy for hospitalized COVID-19 patients via the Expanded Access Program (EAP) and the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), leading to use in about 500,000 patients during the first year of the pandemic for the US.

MethodsWe tracked the number of CCP units dispensed to hospitals by blood banking organizations and correlated that usage with hospital admission and mortality data.

ResultsCCP usage per admission peaked in Fall 2020, with more than 40% of inpatients estimated to have received CCP between late September and early November 2020. However, after randomized controlled trials failed to show a reduction in mortality, CCP usage per admission declined steadily to a nadir of less than 10% in March 2021. We found a strong inverse correlation (r = -0.52, P = 0.002) between CCP usage per hospital admission and deaths occurring two weeks after admission, and this finding was robust to examination of deaths taking place one, two or three weeks after admission. Changes in the number of hospital admissions, SARS-CoV-2 variants, and age of patients could not explain these findings. The retreat from CCP usage might have resulted in as many as 29,000 excess deaths from mid-November 2020 to February 2021.

ConclusionsA strong inverse correlation between CCP use and mortality per admission in the USA provides population level evidence consistent with the notion that CCP reduces mortality in COVID-19 and suggests that the recent decline in usage could have resulted in excess deaths.","Casadevall, A.; Dragotakes, Q.; Johnson, P.

22142,Associations of DMT therapies with COVID-19 severity in multiple sclerosis,"Background: People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are a vulnerable group for severe COVID-19, particularly those taking immunosuppressive disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). We examined the characteristics of COVID-19 severity in an international sample of people with MS. Methods: Data from 12 data-sources in 28 countries were aggregated. Demographic and clinical covariates were queried, alongside COVID-19 clinical severity outcomes, hospitalisation, admission to ICU, requiring artificial ventilation, and death. Characteristics of outcomes were assessed in patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression. Results: 657 (28.1%) with suspected and 1,683 (61.9%) with confirmed COVID-19 were analysed. Older age, progressive MS-phenotype, and higher disability were associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Compared to dimethyl fumarate, ocrelizumab and rituximab were associated with hospitalisation (aOR=1.56,95%CI=1.01-2.41; aOR=2.43,95%CI=1.48-4.02) and ICU admission (aOR=2.30,95%CI=0.98-5.39; aOR=3.93,95%CI=1.56-9.89), though only rituximab was associated with higher risk of artificial ventilation (aOR=4.00,95%CI=1.54-10.39). Compared to pooled other DMTs, ocrelizumab and rituximab were associated with hospitalisation (aOR=1.75,95%CI=1.29-2.38; aOR=2.76,95%CI=1.87-4.07) and ICU admission (aOR=2.55,95%CI=1.49-4.36; aOR=4.32,95%CI=2.27-8.23) but only rituximab with artificial ventilation (aOR=6.15,95%CI=3.09-12.27). Compared to natalizumab, ocrelizumab and rituximab were associated with hospitalisation (aOR=1.86,95%CI=1.13-3.07; aOR=2.88,95%CI=1.68-4.92) and ICU admission (aOR=2.13,95%CI=0.85-5.35; aOR=3.23,95%CI=1.17-8.91), but only rituximab with ventilation (aOR=5.52,95%CI=1.71-17.84). Importantly, associations persisted on restriction to confirmed COVID-19 cases. No associations were observed between DMTs and death. Conclusions: Using the largest cohort of people with MS and COVID-19 available, we demonstrated consistent associations of rituximab with increased risk of hospitalisation, ICU admission, and requiring artificial ventilation, and ocrelizumab with hospitalisation and ICU admission, suggesting their use may be a risk factor for more severe COVID-19.","Simpson-Yap, S.; De Brouwer, E.; Kalincik, T.; Rijke, N.; Hillert, J.; Walton, C.; Edan, G.; Moreau, Y.

15834,Performance characteristics of the VIDAS(R) SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG serological assays,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread worldwide. Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies plays an important role in understanding and controlling the pandemics, notably through epidemiological surveillance. Well validated and highly specific SARS-CoV-2 serological assays are urgently needed. We describe here the analytical and clinical performance of VIDAS(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgM and VIDAS(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgG, two CE-marked, EUA-authorized, automated, qualitative assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG, respectively. Both assays showed high within-run and within-laboratory precision (coefficients of variation < 11.0%) and very low cross-reactivity towards sera of patients with a past common coronavirus or respiratory virus infection. Clinical specificity determined on up to 989 pre-pandemic healthy donors was [&ge;] 99% with a narrow 95% confidence interval for both IgM and IgG assays. Clinical sensitivity was determined on up to 232 samples from 130 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients. The positive percent agreement (PPA) with SARS-CoV-2 PCR reached 100% at [&ge;] 16 days (VIDAS(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgM) and [&ge;] 32 days (VIDAS(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgG) of symptom onset. Combined IgM/IgG test results improved the PPA compared to each test alone. SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion followed closely that of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and remained stable over time, while SARS-CoV-2 IgM levels rapidly declined. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG responses were significantly higher in COVID-19 hospitalized vs. non-hospitalized patients. Altogether, the VIDAS(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays are highly specific and sensitive serological tests suitable for the reliable detection of past acute SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Renard, N.; Daniel, S.; Cayet, N.; Pecquet, M.; Raymond, F.; Pons, S.; Lupo, J.; Tourneur, C.; Pretis, C.; Gerez, G.; Blasco, P.; Combe, M.; Canova, I.; Lesenechal, M.; Berthier, F.",2020-11-24,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.09.28.20196030,2,Mylene Lesenechal,BIOMERIEUX,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.28.20196030v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.28.20196030v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1128/JCM.02292-20
9532,Identifying novel factors associated with COVID-19 transmission and fatality using the machine learning approach,"The COVID-19 virus has infected millions of people and resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. By using the logistic regression model, we identified novel critical factors associated with COVID19 cases, death, and case fatality rates in 154 countries and in the 50 U.S. states. Among numerous factors associated with COVID-19 risk, we found that the unitary state system was counter-intuitively positively associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. Blood type B was a protective factor for COVID-19 risk, while blood type A was a risk factor. The prevalence of HIV, influenza and pneumonia, and chronic lower respiratory diseases was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk. Obesity and the condition of unimproved water sources were associated with increased COVID-19 risk. Other factors included temperature, humidity, social distancing, smoking, and vitamin D intake. Our comprehensive identification of the factors affecting COVID-19 transmission and fatality may provide new insights into the COVID-19 pandemic and advise effective strategies for preventing and migrating COVID-19 spread.","Li, M.; Zhang, Z.; Cao, W.; Liu, Y.; Du, B.; Chen, C.; Liu, Q.; Uddin, M.

23626,"COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance and Hesitancy in Low and Middle Income Countries, and Implications for Messaging","We analyze COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across 15 survey samples covering ten low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Asia, Africa, and South America, Russia (an upper-middle-income country), and the United States, using survey responses from 44,260 individuals. We find considerably higher willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine in LMIC samples (80% on average) compared to the United States (65%) and Russia (30%). Vaccine acceptance was primarily explained by an interest in personal protection against COVID-19, while concern about side effects was the most commonly expressed reason for reluctance. Health workers were the most trusted sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines. Our findings suggest that prioritizing vaccine distribution to LMICs should yield high returns in promoting global immunization coverage, and that vaccination campaigns in these countries should focus on translating acceptance into uptake. Messaging highlighting vaccine efficacy and safety, delivered by healthcare workers, may be most effective in addressing remaining hesitancy.","Solis Arce, J. S.; Warren, S. S.; Meriggi, N.

16386,Age-targeted dose allocation can halve COVID-19 vaccine requirements,"In anticipation of COVID-19 vaccine deployment, we use an age-structured mathematical model to investigate the benefits of optimizing age-specific dose allocation to suppress the transmission, morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 and the associated disease, COVID-19. To minimize transmission, we find that the highest priority individuals across 179 countries are typically those between 30 and 59 years of age because of their high contact rates and higher risk of infection and disease. Conversely, morbidity and mortality are initially most effectively reduced by targeting 60+ year olds who are more likely to experience severe disease. However, when population-level coverage is sufficient -- such that herd immunity can be achieved through targeted dose allocation -- prioritizing middle-aged individuals becomes the most effective strategy to minimize hospitalizations and deaths. For each metric considered, we show that optimizing the allocation of vaccine doses can more than double their effectiveness.","Meehan, M. T.; Cocks, D. G.; Caldwell, J. M.; Trauer, J.

15441,A comparison of five epidemiological models for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in India,"Many popular disease transmission models have helped nations respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by informing decisions about pandemic planning, resource allocation, implementation of social distancing measures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions. We study how five epidemiological models forecast and assess the course of the pandemic in India: a baseline model, an extended SIR (eSIR) model, two extended SEIR (SAPHIRE and SEIR-fansy) models, and a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model (ICM). Using COVID-19 data for India from March 15 to June 18 to train the models, we generate predictions from each of the five models from June 19 to July 18. To compare prediction accuracy with respect to reported cumulative and active case counts and cumulative death counts, we compute the symmetric mean absolute prediction error (SMAPE) for each of the five models. For active case counts, SMAPE values are 0.72 (SEIR-fansy) and 33.83 (eSIR). For cumulative case counts, SMAPE values are 1.76 (baseline) 23.10 (eSIR), 2.07 (SAPHIRE) and 3.20 (SEIR-fansy). For cumulative death counts, the SMAPE values are 7.13 (SEIR-fansy) and 26.30 (eSIR). For cumulative cases and deaths, we compute Pearsons and Lins correlation coefficients to investigate how well the projected and observed reported COVID-counts agree. Three models (SAPHIRE, SEIR-fansy and ICM) return total (sum of reported and unreported) counts as well. We compute underreporting factors as of June 30 and note that the SEIR-fansy model reports the highest underreporting factor for active cases (6.10) and cumulative deaths (3.62), while the SAPHIRE model reports the highest underreporting factor for cumulative cases (27.79).","Purkayastha, S.; Bhattacharyya, R.; Bhaduri, R.; Kundu, R.; Gu, X.; Salvatore, M.; Mishra, S.; Mukherjee, B.",2020-09-22,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.09.19.20198010,2,Bhramar Mukherjee,University of Michigan,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.19.20198010v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.19.20198010v2.full.pdf,cc_by,NA

6964,Deep Transfer Learning-based COVID-19 prediction using Chest X-rays,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is spreading very rapidly across the globe because of its highly contagious nature, and is declared as a pandemic by world health organization (WHO). Scientists are endeavoring to ascertain the drugs for its efficacious treatment. Because, till now, no full-proof drug is available to cure this deadly disease. Therefore, identifying COVID-19 positive people and to quarantine them, can be an effective solution to control its spread. Many machine learning and deep learning techniques are being used quite effectively to classify positive and negative cases. In this work, a deep transfer learning-based model is proposed to classify the COVID-19 cases using chest X-rays or CT scan images of infected persons. The proposed model is based on the ensembling of DenseNet121 and SqueezeNet1.0, which is named as DeQueezeNet. The model can extract the importance of various influential features from the X-ray images, which are effectively used to classify the COVID-19 cases. The performance study of the proposed model depicts its effectiveness in terms of accuracy and precision.

19220,Association between Participation in Government Subsidy Program for Domestic Travel and Symptoms Indicative of COVID-19 Infection,"ImportanceAs countermeasures against the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many countries have introduced or considering financial incentives for people to engage in economic activities such as travel and use restaurants. Japan has implemented a large-scale, nationwide government-funded program that subsidizes up to 50% of all travel expenses since July 2020 with the aim of reviving the travel industry. However, it remains unknown as to how such provision of government subsidies for travel impacted the COVID-19 pandemic.

ObjectiveTo investigate the association between participation in government subsidies for domestic travel in Japan and the incidence of COVID-19 infections.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsUsing the data from a large internet survey conducted between August 25 and September 30, 2020, in Japan, we examined whether individuals who used subsidies experienced a higher likelihood of symptoms indicative of the COVID-19 infection.

ExposureParticipation in the government subsidy program for domestic travel.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresFive symptoms indicative of the COVID-19 infection (high fever, sore throat, cough, headache, and smell and taste disorder) within the past one month of the survey.

ResultsOf the 25,482 respondents (50.3% [12,809] women; mean [SD] age, 48.4 [17.4] years), 3,289 (12.9%) participated in the subsidy program at the time of survey. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that participants in the subsidy program exhibited higher incidence of high fever (adjusted rate, 4.8% for participants vs. 3.7% for non-participants; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.90; 95%CI, 1.42-2.54; p<0.001), sore throat (19.8% vs. 11.3%; aOR, 2.09; 95%CI, 1.37-3.20; p=0.002), cough (19.1% vs. 11.2%; aOR 1.96; 95%CI, 1.27-3.02; p=0.007), headache (29.1% vs. 25.5%; aOR, 1.24; 95%CI, 1.07-1.43; p=0.007), and smell and taste disorder (2.6% vs. 1.8%; aOR 1.98; 95%CI; 1.15-3.40; p=0.01) compared with non-participants.

23115,Covid-19 impact on Parkinson's Disease patients treated by drugs or deep brain stimulation,"PurposeCovid-19 has affected all people, especially those with chronic diseases, including Parkinsons Disease (PD). Covid-19 may affect both motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms of PD patients. We intend to evaluate different aspects of Covid-19 impact on PD patients.

Methods647 PD patients were evaluated in terms of PD-related and Covid-19-related clinical presentations in addition to past medical history during the pandemic through an online questioner. They were compared with an age-matched control group consist of 673 individuals and a sample of the normal population consist of 1215 individuals.

ResultsThe prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients was 11.28%. The mortality was 1.23% among PD patients. The prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients who undergone DBS was 18.18%. No significant association was found between the duration of disease and the prevalence of Covid-19. A statistically significant higher prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients who had direct contact with SARS-CoV-19 infected individuals was found. No statistically significant association has been found between the worsening of motor symptoms and Covid-19. PD patients and the normal population may differ in the prevalence of some psychological disorders, including anxiety and sleeping disorders, and Covid-19 may affect the psychological status.

ConclusionPD patients possibly follow tighter preventive protocols, which lead to lower prevalence and severity of Covid-19 and its consequences in these patients. Although it seems Covid-19 does not affect motor and psychological aspects of PD as much as it was expected, more accurate evaluations are suggested in order to clarify such effects.","Salari, M.; Etemadifar, M.; Zali, A.; Aminzade, Z.; Farsinejad, P.; Tehrani Fateh, S.",2021-03-05,Neurology,10.1101/2021.03.03.21252464,1,Sepand Tehrani Fateh,Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.03.21252464v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.03.21252464v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
12490,"An Analysis of Territorial Patterns in COVID-19 Mortality in France, Spain, Italy and the UK","This paper provides an overview of territorial patterns of COVID-19 deaths in four European countries severely affected by the pandemic, Spain, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The analysis focuses on cumulated COVID-19 mortality at the sub-regional level, following the territorial subdivision of countries adopted by the European Union. The paper builds upon a dataset with highly granular information on COVID- 19 deaths assembled from various sources. The analysis shows remarkable differences in territorial patterns of COVID-19 mortality, both within and across the four countries reviewed. Results somewhat differ depending on the aspect considered (concentration of deaths or mortality rates) but, in general, Italy, France and Spain display significant territorial disparities, with selected sub-regions being disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Instead, the picture is more uniform in the UK, with comparatively lower differences across the various sub- regions. These findings suggest that analyses of COVID-19 mortality at the national level (and, sometimes, even at the regional level) may conceal major differences and therefore be of limited use, both analytically and from an operational viewpoint.","Zavatta, R.",2020-07-29,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.07.27.20162677,1,Roberto Zavatta,Economisti Associati,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.20162677v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.20162677v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
25566,Predicting daily COVID-19 case rates from SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations across a diversity of wastewater catchments,"We assessed the relationship between municipality COVID-19 case rates and SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in the primary sludge of corresponding wastewater treatment facilities. Over 1,000 daily primary sludge samples were collected from six wastewater treatment facilities with catchments serving 18 cities and towns in the State of Connecticut, USA. Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations during a six-month time period that overlapped with fall 2020 and winter 2021 COVID-19 outbreaks in each municipality. We fit a single regression model to estimate reported case rates in the six municipalities from SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations collected daily from corresponding wastewater treatment facilities. Results demonstrate the ability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in primary sludge to estimate COVID-19 reported case rates across treatment facilities and wastewater catchments, with coverage probabilities ranging from 0.94 to 0.96. Leave-one-out cross validation suggests that the model can be broadly applied to wastewater catchments that range in more than one order of magnitude in population served. Estimation of case rates from wastewater data can be useful in locations with limited testing availability or testing disparities, or delays in individual COVID-19 testing programs.","Zulli, A.; Pan, A.; Bart, S.

Although there are outbreak reports involving mass gatherings, the contribution to overall transmission is unknown.

MethodsWe used data from a survey of social contact behaviour that specifically asked about contact with groups to estimate the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) due to groups as the relative change in the Basic Reproduction Number when groups are prevented.

FindingsGroups of 50+ individuals accounted for 0.5% of reported contact events, and we estimate that the PAF due to groups of 50+ people is 5.4% (95%CI 1.4%, 11.5%). The PAF due to groups of 20+ people is 18.9% (12.7%, 25.7%) and the PAF due to groups of 10+ is 25.2% (19.4%, 31.4%)

InterpretationLarge groups of individuals have a relatively small epidemiological impact; small and medium sized groups between 10 and 50 people have a larger impact on an epidemic.","Brooks-Pollock, E.; Read, J.

11652,The amplified second outbreaks of global COVID-19 pandemic,"COVID-19 is now in an epidemic phase, with a second outbreak likely to appear at any time. The intensity and timing of a second outbreak is a common concern worldwide. In this study, we made scenario projections of the potential second outbreak of COVID-19 using a statistical-epidemiology model, which considers both the impact of seasonal changes in meteorological elements and human social behaviors such as protests and city unblocking. Recent street protests in the United States and other countries are identified as a hidden trigger and amplifier of the second outbreak. The scale and intensity of subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks in the U.S. cities where the epidemic is under initial control are projected to be much greater than those of the first outbreak. For countries without reported protests, lifting the COVID-19 related restrictions prematurely would accelerate the spread of the disease and place mounting pressure on the local medical system that is already overloaded. We anticipate these projections will support public health planning and policymaking by governments and international organizations.","Huang, J.; Liu, X.; Zhang, L.; Yang, K.; Chen, Y.; Huang, Z.; Liu, C.; Lian, X.; Wang, D.",2020-07-20,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.07.15.20154161,2,Jianping Huang,Collaborative Innovation Center for Western Ecological Safety,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154161v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154161v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
18356,Designing Efficient Contact Tracing Through Risk-Based Quarantining,"Contact tracing for COVID-19 is especially challenging because transmission often occurs in the absence of symptoms and because a purported 20% of cases cause 80% of infections, resulting in a small risk of infection for some contacts and a high risk for others. Here, we introduce risk-based quarantine, a system for contact tracing where each cluster (a group of individuals with a common source of exposure) is observed for symptoms when tracing begins, and clusters that do not display them are released from quarantine. We show that, under our assumptions, risk-based quarantine reduces the amount of quarantine time served by more than 30%, while achieving a reduction in transmission similar to standard contact tracing policies where all contacts are quarantined for two weeks. We compare our proposed risk-based quarantine approach against test-driven release policies, which fail to achieve a comparable level of transmission reduction due to the inability of tests to detect exposed people who are not yet infectious but will eventually become so. Additionally, test-based release policies are expensive, limiting their effectiveness in low-resource environments, whereas the costs imposed by risk-based quarantine are primarily in terms of labor and organization.","Perrault, A.; Charpignon, M.; Gruber, J.; Tambe, M.; Majumder, M.

9404,What does and does not correlate with COVID-19 death rates,"We correlate county-level COVID-19 death rates with key variables using both linear regression and negative binomial mixed models, although we focus on linear regression models. We include four sets of variables: socio-economic variables, county-level health variables, modes of commuting, and climate and pollution patterns. Our analysis studies daily death rates from April 4, 2020 to May 27, 2020. We estimate correlation patterns both across states, as well as within states. For both models, we find higher shares of African American residents in the county are correlated with higher death rates. However, when we restrict ourselves to correlation patterns within a given state, the statistical significance of the correlation of death rates with the share of African Americans, while remaining positive, wanes. We find similar results for the share of elderly in the county. We find that higher amounts of commuting via public transportation, relative to telecommuting, is correlated with higher death rates. The correlation between driving into work, relative to telecommuting, and death rates is also positive across both models, but statistically significant only when we look across states and counties. We also find that a higher share of people not working, and thus not commuting either because they are elderly, children or unemployed, is correlated with higher death rates. Counties with higher home values, higher summer temperatures, and lower winter temperatures have higher death rates. Contrary to past work, we do not find a correlation between pollution and death rates. Also importantly, we do not find that death rates are correlated with obesity rates, ICU beds per capita, or poverty rates. Finally, our model that looks within states yields estimates of how a given states death rate compares to other states after controlling for the variables included in our model; this may be interpreted as a measure of how states are doing relative to others. We find that death rates in the Northeast are substantially higher compared to other states, even when we control for the four sets of variables above. Death rates are also statistically significantly higher in Michigan, Louisiana, Iowa, Indiana, and Colorado. Californias death rate is the lowest across all states.

It is important to understand that this research, and other observational analyses like it, only identify correlations: these relationships are not necessarily causal. However, these correlations may help policy makers identify variables that may potentially be causally related to COVID-19 death rates and adopt appropriate policies after understanding the causal relationship.","Knittel, C.

6961,Cross-sectional IgM and IgG profiles in SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundAccurate serological assays can improve the early diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, but few studies have compared performance characteristics between assays in symptomatic and recovered patients.

MethodsWe recruited 32 patients who had 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19; 18 hospitalized and actively symptomatic, 14 recovered mild cases), and measured levels of IgM (against the full-length S1 or the highly homologous SARS-CoV E protein) and IgG (against S1 receptor binding domain [RBD]). We performed the same analysis in 103 pre-2020 healthy adult control (HC) participants and 13 participants who had negative molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2.

ResultsAnti-S1-RBD IgG levels were very elevated within days of symptom onset for hospitalized patients (median 2.04 optical density [OD], vs. 0.12 in HC). People who recovered from milder COVID-19 only reached similar IgG levels 28 days after symptom onset. IgM levels were elevated early in both groups (median 1.91 and 2.12 vs. 1.14 OD in HC for anti-S1 IgM, 2.23 and 2.26 vs 1.52 in HC for anti-E IgM), with downward trends in hospitalized cases having longer disease duration. The combination of the two IgM levels showed similar sensitivity for COVID-19 as IgG but greater specificity, and identified 4/10 people (vs. 3/10 by IgG) with prior symptoms and negative molecular testing to have had COVID-19.

ConclusionsDisease severity and timing both influence levels of IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2, with IgG better for early detection of severe cases but IgM more suited for early detection of milder cases.","Ozturk, T.; Howell, C.; Benameur, K.; Ramonell, R.

19444,Efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation in severe and critical-ill COVID-19 patients: a controlled study,"Severe and critical ill COVID-19 patients frequently need acute care hospitalization including mechanical ventilation at ICU due to acute respiratory distress. A high proportion of these patients will develop ICU-acquired weakness and a need for rehabilitation. However data on rehabilitation outcomes in these patients are scarce and the efficacy of rehabilitation remains essentially unclear. We therefore compared the rehabilitation outcomes between COVID-19 patients with pneumonia and other patients with common pneumonia to assess their rehabilitation efficacies.

We retrospectively compared the performances of six-min walk test (6MWT), chronic respiratory questionnaire (CRQ), and functional independence measure (FIM) at the discharge from pulmonary rehabilitation between 51 Covid-19 patients and 51 patients with common pneumonia using linear regression controlled for baseline values at entrance, age, sex and cumulative Illness rating scale. Fisher exact test was applied to test whether the odd ratios (ORs) of non-improvement/improvement in 6MWT (>30-m) and CRQ (>10-point) at discharge were different between the two groups.

Covid-19 patients had similar performances at discharge in 6MWT (P-value=0.14), CRQ (P-value=0.55), and 4.2-point higher (P-value=0.004) in FIM compared to the control group. No differences in the outcomes were found between severe and critical COVID-19 patients. The OR of non-improvement/improvement in 6MWT was 0.30 (P-value=0.13) between COVID-19 and control groups; but the odd of non-improvement in CRQ tended to be 3.02 times higher (P-value =0.075) in COVID-19 group.

In-house rehabilitation is effective and suitable for COVID-19 patients irrespective from disease severity. The discrepancy of high physical improvement and relatively low gains of disease related quality of life compared to control patients with common pneumonia is however remarkable. Further studies need to evaluate whether this discrepancy is an indicator of chronic disease development.","Buesching, G.; Zhang, Z.; Schmid, J.

9376,Work-related and Personal Factors Associated with Mental Well-being during COVID-19 Response: A Survey of Health Care and Other Workers,"ObjectiveMeasure the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, work-exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being among faculty and staff at a university and academic medical center during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and describe work-related and personal factors associated with mental health and well-being.

DesignObservational cohort study conducted between April 17 and May 1, 2020 using a web-based questionnaire.

SettingMedical and main campuses of a university.

ParticipantsAll faculty, staff, and post-doctoral fellows.

ExposuresWork factors including supervisor support and exposure to high-risk clinical settings; personal factors including demographics and family/home stressors.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresStress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being.

ResultsThere were 5550 respondents (overall response rate of 34.3%). 38% of faculty and 14% of staff (n=915) were providing clinical care, while 57% of faculty and 77% of staff were working from home. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and work exhaustion were somewhat higher among clinicians than non-clinicians. Among all workers, anxiety, depression, and high work exhaustion were independently associated with community or clinical exposure to COVID-19 [Prevalence Ratios and 95% confidence intervals 1.37(1.09- 1.73), 1.28(1.03 - 1.59), and 1.24(1.13 - 1.36) respectively]. Poor family supportive behaviors by supervisors were also associated with these outcomes [1.40 (1.21 - 1.62), 1.69 (1.48 - 1.92), 1.54 (1.44 - 1.64)]. Age below 40 and a greater number of family/home stressors were also associated with poorer outcomes. Among the subset of clinicians, caring for patients with COVID-19 and work in high-risk clinical settings were additional risk factors.

Conclusions and ImplicationsOur findings suggest that the pandemic has had negative effects on mental health and well-being among both clinical and non-clinical employees. Prevention of exposure to COVID-19 and increased supervisor support are modifiable risk factors that may protect mental health and well-being.","Evanoff, B. A.; Strickland, J. R.; Dale, A.

6603,Myocardial characteristics as the prognosis for COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundAmid the crisis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), front-line clinicians in collaboration with backstage medical researchers analyzed clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients and reported the prognosis using myocardial data records upon hospitalization.

MethodsWe reported 135 cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted in The First Peoples Hospital of Jiangxia District in Wuhan, China. Demographic data, medical history, and laboratory parameters were taken from inpatient records and compared between patients at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and non-ICU isolation wards for prognosis on disease severity. In particular, survivors and non-survivors upon ICU admission were compared for prognosis on disease mortality.

ResultsFor COVID-19 patients, blood test results showed more significantly deranged values in the ICU group than those in non-ICU. Among those parameters for ICU patients, myocardial variables including troponin T, creatine kinase isoenzymes, myoglobin, were found significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors.

ConclusionsUpon hospitalization abnormal myocardial metabolism in COVID-19 patients could be prognostic indicators of a worsened outcome for disease severity and mortality.","Zhang, J.; Ding, D.; Cao, C.; Zhang, J.; Huang, X.; Fu, P.; Liang, G.; Xu, W.; Tao, Z.",2020-05-09,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.06.20068882,1,Zhimin Tao,"School of Medicine, Jiangsu University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.20068882v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.20068882v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
25639,Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection over six months among Nicaraguan outpatients,"New information is emerging about SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology and immunity, but little of this information comes from low- and middle-income countries or from patients receiving care in the outpatient setting. The current study investigated the SARS-CoV-2 infection status and antibody responses in 157 patients seeking care for a respiratory disease suggestive of COVID-19 in private healthcare clinics during the first wave (June-October 2020) of infections in Nicaragua. We examined nasal swabs for the presence of viral RNA via RT-PCR and longitudinally collected sera for the changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibody levels over six months. Among patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, we evaluated if clinical symptoms were associated with age, hematological parameters and co-morbidities. The combination of PCR and paired serology identified 60 (38%) of the 157 outpatients as acute COVID-19. While both PCR and serology identified the majority (n = 38, 64%) of the acute infections, a notable number of outpatients were identified by RT-qPCR (n = 13, 22%) or by serology (n = 9, 14%) only. During the longitudinal study, we identified 6 new infections by serology among the 97 non-COVID-19 subjects. In conclusion, this study report that more than one third of the outpatients seeking care for acute respiratory disease during the first epidemic wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Nicaragua had an acute mild COVID-19 infection that correlate with prolonged humoral response. This immune response to the RBD antigen, more likely IgG dependent, significantly increased between the acute to convalescent and decay in the late convalescent but still remained seropositive.","Bucardo, F.; Gonzalez, F.; Zepeda, O.; Toval Ruiz, C.

6229,Measuring voluntary and policy-induced social distancing behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Staying home and avoiding unnecessary contact is an important part of the effort to contain COVID-19 and limit deaths. Every state in the United States enacted policies to encourage distancing, and some mandated staying home. Understanding how these policies interact with individuals voluntary responses to the COVID-19 epidemic is critical for estimating the transmission dynamics of the pathogen and assessing the impact of policies. We use the variation in policy responses along with smart device data, which measures the amount of time Americans stayed home, to show that there was substantial voluntary avoidance behavior. We disentangle the extent to which observed shifts in behavior are induced by policy and find evidence of a non-trivial voluntary response to local reported COVID-19 cases and deaths, such that around 45 cases in a home county is associated with the same amount of time at home as a stay-at-home order. People responded to the risk of contracting COVID-19 and to policy orders, though the response to policy orders crowds out or displaces a large share of the voluntary response, suggesting that, during early stages of the U.S. outbreak, better compliance with social distancing recommendations could have been achieved with policy crafted to complement voluntary behavior.

Significance StatementAmericans are spending substantially more time at home to reduce the spread of COVID-19. This behavioral shift is a mix of voluntary disease avoidance and policy-induced behavioral changes. Both need to be accounted for. Disentangling voluntary from policy-induced behavioral changes is critical for governments relaxing or renewing restrictions. A substantial share of the behavioral response appears to be voluntary, but this behavior was offset by strong stay-at-home orders. Local testing and rapid reporting is a first step to making better use of voluntary behavioral changes.","Yan, Y.; Malik, A. A.; Bayham, J.; Fenichel, E. P.; Couzens, C.; Omer, S.

4083,"A streamlined approach to rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, avoiding RNA extraction","In the current pandemic, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples by nucleic acid (NA) molecular analysis is the only method available to diagnose COVID-19 disease and to assess patients infectiveness. Recently, the demand for laboratory reagents has greatly increased; in particular, there is a worldwide shortage of RNA extraction kits. Here, we describe a fast, simple and inexpensive method for the detection of SARS CoV-2 RNA, which includes a pretreatment with Proteinase K and a heating-cooling cycle before the amplification. This method bypasses the RNA extraction step; it leads to a higher amount of available viral RNA compared to the automated extraction methods, and generates the same profile in the subsequent amplification phase.","Marzinotto, S.; Mio, C.; Cifu', A.; Verardo, R.; Pipan, C.; Schneider, C.; Curcio, F.",2020-04-11,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.04.06.20054114,1,Francesco Curcio,"Department of Laboratory Medicine, ASU FC, Udine, Italy",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20054114v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20054114v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
6985,The association of cardiovascular disease and other pre-existing comorbidities with COVID-19 mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundExploring the association of coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19) mortality with chronic pre-existing conditions may promote the importance of targeting these populations during this pandemic to optimize survival. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to explore the association of pre-existing conditions with COVID-19 mortality.

MethodsWe searched MEDLINE, OVID databases, SCOPUS, and medrxiv.org for the period December 1, 2019, to May 1, 2020. The outcome of interest was the risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients with and without pre-existing conditions. Comorbidities explored were cardiovascular diseases (coronary artery disease, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, and stroke. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. All analyses were performed using random-effects models and heterogeneity was quantified.

ResultsTen chronic conditions from 19 studies were included in the meta-analysis (n = 61,455 patients with COVID-19; mean age, 61 years; 57% male). Overall the between-study study heterogeneity was medium and studies had low publication bias and high quality. Coronary heart disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and cancer significantly increased the risk of mortality from COVID-19. The risk of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with coronary heart disease was 2.4 times as high as those without coronary heart disease (RR= 2.40, 95%CI=1.71-3.37, n=5) and twice as high in patients with hypertension as high as that compared to those without hypertension (RR=1.89, 95%CI= 1.58-2.27, n=9). Patients with cancer also were at twice the risk of mortality from COVID-19 compared to those without cancer (RR=1.93 95%CI 1.15-3.24, n=4), and those with congestive heart failure were at 2.5 times the risk of mortality compared to those without congestive heart failure (RR=2.66, 95%CI 1.58-4.48, n=3).

ConclusionsCOVID-19 patients with all any cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and cancer have an increased risk of mortality. Tailored infection prevention and treatment strategies targeting this high-risk population are warranted to optimize survival.","Ssentongo, P.; Ssentongo, A. E.; Heilbrunn, E. S.; Ba, D.

11860,Role of intermediate care unit admission and non-invasive respiratory support during the COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective cohort study,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to shortage of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) capacity. We developed a triage strategy including non-invasive respiratory support and admission to the intermediate care unit (IMCU). ICU admission was restricted to patients requiring invasive ventilation.

ObjectivesThe aim of this study is to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted to the intermediate care unit.

MethodRetrospective cohort including consecutive patients admitted between March 28th and April 27th 2020. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure avoiding ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included the rate of emergency intubation, 28-days mortality and predictors of ICU admission.

ResultsOne hundred fifty seven patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia were admitted to the IMCU. Among the 85 patients admitted for worsening respiratory failure, 52/85 (61%) avoided ICU admission. In multivariate analysis, PaO2/FiO2 (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.96 to 0.99) and Body Mass Index (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.98) were significantly associated with ICU admission. No death or emergency intubation occurred in the intermediate care unit. Among the 72 patients transferred from the ICU, 60/72 (83%) presented neurological complications.

ConclusionsNon-invasive respiratory support including High-Flow Nasal Oxygen and continuous positive airway pressure prevents ICU admission for a large proportion of patients with COVID-19 hypoxemic respiratory failure. In the context of the COVID pandemic, intermediate care units may play an important role in preserving ICU capacity by avoiding ICU admission for patients with worsening respiratory failure and allowing early discharge of ICU patients.","Grosgurin, O.; Leidi, A.; Darbellay-Farhoumand, P.; Carballo, S.; Reny, J.-L.; Adler, D.; Bollen Pinto, B.; Rossel, A.; Serratrice, J.; Agoritsas, T.; Stirnemann, J.; Marti, C.",2020-07-17,Intensive Care And Critical Care Medicine,10.1101/2020.07.17.20155929,1,Olivier Grosgurin,Geneva University Hospitals,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20155929v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20155929v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
21769,Differential expression of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 in Nasal Tissue of Patients with Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became a pandemic and a global health emergency. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed in nasal epithelial cells and plays a major role in cellular entry leading to infection. High expression of ACE2 has been suggested to be a potential risk factor for virus infection and disease severity. However the profile of ACE2 gene expression in diseases of the upper airways remains poorly understood. We herein investigated ACE2 gene expression in the nasal tissues of a cohort of Swedish patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNPs) using RT-qPCR. ACE2 mRNA expression was significantly reduced in the nasal mucosa of CRSwNP patients compared to that of controls. Moreover, we observed a sex-dependant difference in nasal ACE2 expression, where significantly lower levels of the ACE2 transcript were detected in the nasal mucosa of only female CRSwNP patients. These findings indicate that CRSwNP patients with a decrease in ACE2 gene expression may thereby be less prone to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. These results enhance our understanding on the profile of ACE2 expression in the nasal mucosa of patients with upper airway diseases, and their susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2.","Fowler, P.

3365,The Novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) Directly Decimates Human Spleens and Lymph Nodes,"While lymphocytopenia is a common characteristic of patients infected by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the mechanisms responsible for this depletion are unclear. Through careful inspection of the spleens and lymph nodes (LNs) from six cases with postmortem examinations, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 could directly infect secondary lymphoid organs to induce cell death. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), the potential receptor of SARS-CoV-2, expresses on tissue-resident CD169+ macrophages in spleens and LNs. Immunofluorescent staining confirmed that viral nucleocaspid protein (NP) can be found in ACE2+ cells, CD169+ macrophages, but not in CD3+ T cells or B220+ B cells in spleens and LNs. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces severe tissue damage including lymph follicle depletion, splenic nodule atrophy, histiocyte hyperplasia and lymphocyte reductions. Moreover, in situ TUNEL staining illustrated that viral infection leads to severe lymphocyte apoptosis, which might be mediated by viral antigens inducing Fas upregulation. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 also triggers macrophages to produce IL-6, a proinflammatory cytokine that directly promotes lymphocyte necrosis. Collectively, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 directly neutralizes human spleens and LNs through infecting tissue-resident CD169+ macrophages.","Chen, Y.; Feng, Z.; Diao, B.; Wang, R.; Wang, G.; Wang, C.; Tan, Y.; Liu, L.; Wang, C.; Liu, Y.; Liu, Y.; Yuan, Z.; Ren, L.; Wu, Y.",2020-03-31,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.03.27.20045427,1,Yongwen Chen,"Institute of Immunology, PLA, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045427v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045427v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
3199,"Clinical features and outcomes of 197 adult discharged patients with COVID-19 in Yichang, Hubei","PurposeTo investigate the epidemiology and clinical features of discharged adult patients with coronavirus infection disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Yichang.

MethodThe retrospective study recruited 197 cases of COVID-19 discharged from Yichang Central Peoples Hospital and Yichang Third Peoples Hospital from Jan 17 to Feb 26, 2020. All cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR or chest computer tomography (CT). The survivors were followed up until March 4,2020. Clinical data, including demographic characteristic, presentation, underlying illness, exposure history, laboratory examination, radiology and prognosis were enrolled and analyzed by SPSS 19.0 software.

ResultsThere were 197 adult discharged patients with COVID-19 in this study. Statistical analysis indicated that the average age was 55.94 years, and female patients were 99(50.3%).Those patients mainly resided in urban with exposure history in 2 weeks, while 7 medical staffs were infected. Fever (77.6%%), cough (43.6%) and weakness (14.7%) were the common symptoms. Leukocytes were mainly normal or decreased in 185 patients (92.9%), both lymphocytes and eosinophils were below normal range, the ratios were 56.9% and 50.3%, respectively. On the contrary, lactate dehydrogenases raised in 65 patients. C-reactive protein (72.4%) elevated in the most of patients. The sensitivity of RT-PCR was 63.5%. Chest CT indicated that bilateral patchy shadows (69.0%) were the most common imaging manifestations.169(85.8%) patients recovered and transferred to a designated hospital for observation, and the others (14.2%) turned worst and died of acute respiratory failure.

ConclusionCOVID-19 infection with highly contagious have become a life-threaten public healthy problem, the sensitivity of RT-PCR was limited. Chest CT scan was recommended for the suspected patients. Furthermore, lymphocytopenia and eosinophils declining without leukocytes increasing may be considered as a useful evidence for the diagnosis.","Zhou, F.; Yu, X.; Tong, X.; Zhang, R.",2020-04-05,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.26.20041426,2,Rong Zhang,Yichang Central people\'s hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20041426v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20041426v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
11353,In-house modification and improvement of the CDC real-time PCR diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection.,"The world is currently facing an unprecedented pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) which was first reported in late 2019 by China to the World Health Organization (WHO). The containment strategy for COVID-19, which has non-specific flu-like symptoms and where upwards of 80% of the affected has either mild or no symptoms, is critically centered upon diagnostic testing, tracking and isolation. Thus, the development of specific and sensitive diagnostic tests for COVID-19 is key towards the first successful step of disease management. Public health organizations like the WHO and the US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have developed real-time PCR (RT-PCR) based diagnostic tests to aid in the detection of acute infection. In this study we sought to modify the CDC RT-PCR diagnostic assay protocol to increase its sensitivity and to make the assay directly portable to health care providers in a community-based hospital setting. A number of modifications to the original protocol were tested. Increasing the RT-PCR annealing temperature by 7{degrees}C to 62{degrees}C was associated with the most significant improvement in sensitivity, wherein the cycle-threshold (Ct) value for the N2 assay was reduced by [~]3 units, in effect both reducing the overall number of inconclusive results and yielding N1/N2 assays to have similar Ct values. The limit of detection of the modified assay was also improved (0.86 RNA copies/{micro}l for both nCoV 2019_N1/N2 assays) compared to the CDC RT-PCR diagnostic assay (1 and 3.16 RNA copies/{micro}l for nCoV 2019_N1 and N2 assay, respectively). Using this modification, there was no significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 detection rate when viral RNA extraction was performed either manually or through an automated extraction method. We believe this modified protocol allows for more sensitive detection of the virus which in turn will be useful for pandemic management.","Das, S.; Dowell-Martino, C.; Arrigo, L.; Fiedler, P.

17620,What is the efficacy and safety of rapid exercise tests for exertional desaturation in Covid-19: A rapid review protocol,"BackgroundEven when resting pulse oximetry is normal in the patient with acute Covid-19, hypoxia can manifest on exertion. We sought to summarise the literature on the performance of different rapid tests for exertional desaturation.

Research questionWhat tests have been formally evaluated for the rapid assessment of exertional hypoxia? What is the evidence for their accuracy, practicability and safety in the context of suspected acute Covid-19? To what extent will these tests help identify patients with evidence of either silent or hidden hypoxia leading to earlier recognition of those at risk of severe outcomes?

MethodWe aim to review three independent searches of AMED, CINAHL, EMBASE MEDLINE, Cochrane and PubMed using LitCovid, Scholar and Google databases until 24th September 2020. Screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal of full-text papers will be completed independently by two reviewers including a topic expert and a review expert. Studies will be tabulated and assessed for risk of bias using QUADAS 2 tool.

DiscussionThis rapid review aims to produce key findings relevant to the assessment of exertional desaturation in patients with suspected Covid-19. Establishing a validated tool to assess exertional desaturation will help to ensure that future research on this topic can be undertaken in a consistent way. An exertional desaturation test should be used in combination with a comprehensive clinical evaluation and only on patients whose resting oximetry reading is 96% or above unless in a supervised care setting. It should be terminated if the patient experiences adverse effects.","Kalin, A.; Greenhalgh, T.; Javid, B.; Knight, M.; Inada-Kim, M.",2020-11-04,Respiratory Medicine,10.1101/2020.10.31.20223453,1,Trish Greenhalgh,"University of Oxford, UK",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.31.20223453v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.31.20223453v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1186/s13643-021-01620-w
21344,Preliminary Evidence on Long COVID in children,"There is increasing evidence that adult patients diagnosed with acute COVID-19 suffer from Long COVID initially described in Italy.

To date, data on Long COVID in children are lacking.

We assessed persistent symptoms in pediatric patients previously diagnosed with COVID-19. More than a half reported at least one persisting symptom even after 120 days since COVID-19, with 42.6% being impaired by these symptoms during daily activities. Symptoms like fatigue, muscle and joint pain, headache, insomnia, respiratory problems and palpitations were particularly frequent, as also described in adults.

The evidence that COVID-19 can have long-term impact children as well, including those with asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic COVID-19, highlight the need for pediatricians, mental health experts and policy makers of implementing measures to reduce impact of the pandemic on childs health.","Buonsenso, D.; Munblit, D.; De Rose, C.; Sinatti, D.; Ricchiuto, A.; Carfi, A.; Valentini, P.",2021-01-26,Pediatrics,10.1101/2021.01.23.21250375,1,Danilo Buonsenso,"Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

18180,Does the timing of government COVID-19 policy interventions matter? Policy analysis of an original database.,"ObjectiveThough the speed of policy interventions is critical in responding to a fast spreading pandemic, there is little research on this topic. This study aims to (1) review the state of research on the topic (2) compile an original dataset of 87 COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions across 17 countries and (3) analyses the timing of COVID-19 policy interventions on mortality rates of individual countries.

DesignStatistical analysis using Excel and R language version 3.4.2 (2017-09-28) of 1479 non-pharmaceutical policy interventions data points.

SettingChina, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Australia, Germany, Canada, India, United Arab Emirates, United States of America, South Africa, Egypt, Jordan, France, Iran, United Kingdom and Italy.

Population36 health policies, 19 fiscal policies; 8 innovation policies; 19 social distancing policies, and 5 travel policies - related to COVID-19.

InterventionsWe calculate the time (time-lag) between the start date of a policy and three-time specific events: the first reported case in Wuhan, China; the first nationally reported disease case; the first nationally reported death.

Main Outcome MeasuresNational level mortality rates across 17 countries. Mortality rate is equivalent to (death attributed to COVID-19) / (death attributed to COVID-19 + COVID-19 recovered cases).

ResultsThe literature review found 22 studies that looked at policy and timing with respect to mortality rates. Only four were multicountry, multi-policy studies. Based on the analysis of the database, we find no significant direction of the association (positive or negative) between the time lag from the three specified points and mortality rates. The standard deviation (SD) of policy lags was of the same order of magnitude as the mean of lags (30.57 and 30.22 respectively), indicating that there is no consensus among countries on the optimal time lags to implement a given policy. At the country level, the average time lag to implement a policy decreased the longer the time duration between the countrys first case and the Wuhan first case, indicating countries got faster to implement policies as more time passed.

ConclusionsThe timing of policy interventions across countries relative to the first Wuhan case, first national disease case, or first national death, is not found to be correlated with mortality. No correlation between country quickness of policy intervention and country mortality was found. Countries became quicker in implementing policies as time passed. However, no correlation between country quickness of policy intervention and country mortality was found. Policy interventions across countries relative to the first recorded case in each country, is not found to be correlated with mortality for 86 of the 87 policies. At the country level we find that no correlation was found between country-average delays in implementing policies and country mortality. Further there is no correlation with higher country rankings in The Global Health Security Index and policy timing and mortality rates.

22620,Informing patients that they are at high risk for serious complications of viral infection increases vaccination rates,"For many vaccine-preventable diseases like influenza, vaccination rates are lower than optimal to achieve community protection. Those at high risk for infection and serious complications are especially advised to be vaccinated to protect themselves. Using influenza as a model, we studied one method of increasing vaccine uptake: informing high-risk patients, identified by a machine learning model, about their risk status. Patients (N=39,717) were evenly randomized to (1) a control condition (exposure only to standard direct mail or patient portal vaccine promotion efforts) or to be told via direct mail, patient portal, and/or SMS that they were (2) at high risk for influenza and its complications if not vaccinated; (3) at high risk according to a review of their medical records; or (4) at high risk according to a computer algorithm analysis of their medical records. Patients in the three treatment conditions were 5.7% more likely to get vaccinated during the 112 days post-intervention (p < .001), and did so 1.4 days earlier (p < .001), on average, than those in the control group. There were no significant differences among risk messages, suggesting that patients are neither especially averse to nor uniquely appreciative of learning their records had been reviewed or that computer algorithms were involved. Similar approaches should be considered for COVID-19 vaccination campaigns.","Shermohammed, M.; Goren, A.; Lanyado, A.; Yesharim, R.; Wolk, D. M.; Doyle, J.; Meyer, M. N.; Chabris, C.

2290,Estimating the burden of United States workers exposed to infection or disease: a key factor in containing risk of COVID-19 infection,"IntroductionWith the global spread of COVID-19, there is a compelling public health interest in quantifying who is at increased risk of disease. Occupational characteristics, such as interfacing with the public and being in close quarters with other workers, not only put workers at high risk for disease, but also make them a nexus of disease transmission to the community. This can further be exacerbated through presenteeism, the term used to describe the act of coming to work despite being symptomatic for disease. Understanding which occupational groups are exposed to infection and disease in the workplace can help to inform public health risk response and management for COVID-19, and subsequent infectious disease outbreaks.

MethodsTo estimate the burden of United States workers exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, national employment data (by Standard Occupational Classification) maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with BLS O*NET survey data, which ranks occupations with particular physical, ergonomic, and structural exposures. For this analysis, occupations reporting exposure to infection or disease more than once a month was the focus.

ResultsBased on our analyses, approximately 10% (14.4 M) of United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per week. Approximately 18.4% (26.7 M) of all United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per month. While the majority of exposed workers are employed in healthcare sectors, other occupational sectors also have high proportions of exposed workers. These include protective service occupations (e.g. police officers, correctional officers, firefighters), office and administrative support occupations (e.g. couriers and messengers, patient service representatives), education occupations (e.g. preschool and daycare teachers), community and social services occupations (community health workers, social workers, counselors), and even construction and extraction occupations (e.g. plumbers, septic tank installers, elevator repair).

ConclusionsThe large number of persons employed in a wide variety of occupations with frequent exposure to infection and disease underscore the importance of all workplaces developing risk response plans for COVID-19. This work also serves as an important reminder that the workplace is a key locus for public health interventions, which could protect both workers and the communities they serve.","Baker, M.

7233,SARS-CoV-2 spillover into hospital outdoor environments,"The outbreak of coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has rapidly spread throughout over 200 countries, posing a global threat to human health. Till 15th May 2020, there are over 4.5 million confirmed cases, with roughly 300,000 death1. To date, most studies focus on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in indoor environment owing to its main transmission routes via human respiratory droplets and direct contact2,3. It remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can spill over and impose transmission risks to outdoor environments despite potential threats to people and communities. Here, we investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by measuring viral RNA in 73 samples from outdoor environment of three hospitals in Wuhan. We detected SARS-CoV-2 in soils (205-550 copies/g), aerosols (285-1,130 copies/m3) and wastewaters (255 to 18,744 copies/L) in locations close to hospital departments receiving COVID-19 patients or in wastewater treatment sectors. These findings reveal significant viral spillover in hospital outdoor environments that was possibly caused by respiratory droplets from patients or aerosolized particles from wastewater containing SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in other areas or on surfaces with regular disinfection implemented. Soils may behave as viral warehouse through deposition and serve as a secondary source spreading SARS-CoV-2 for a prolonged time. For the first time, our findings demonstrate that there are high-risk areas in hospital outdoor environments to spread SARS-CoV-2, calling for sealing of wastewater treatment unit and complete sanitation to prevent COVID-19 transmission risks.","Zhang, D.; Yang, Y.; Huang, X.; Jiang, J.; Li, M.; Zhang, X.; Ling, H.; Li, J.; Liu, Y.; Li, G.; Li, W.; Yi, C.; Zhang, T.; Jiang, Y.; Xiong, Y.; Hu, Z.; Wang, X.; Deng, S.; Zhao, P.; Qu, J.",2020-05-19,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.12.20097105,2,Dayi Zhang,Tsinghua University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20097105v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20097105v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
17250,"Detecting COVID-19 infection hotspots in England using large-scale self-reported data from a mobile application: a prospective, observational study","BackgroundAs many countries seek to slow the spread of COVID-19 without reimposing national restrictions, it has become important to track the disease at a local level to identify areas in need of targeted intervention.

MethodsWe performed modelling on longitudinal, self-reported data from users of the COVID Symptom Study app in England between 24 March and 29 September, 2020. Combining a symptom-based predictive model for COVID-19 positivity and RT-PCR tests provided by the Department of Health we were able to estimate disease incidence, prevalence and effective reproduction number. Geographically granular estimates were used to highlight regions with rapidly increasing case numbers, or hotspots.

FindingsMore than 2.8 million app users in England provided 120 million daily reports of their symptoms, and recorded the results of 170,000 PCR tests. On a national level our estimates of incidence and prevalence showed similar sensitivity to changes as two national community surveys: the ONS and REACT-1 studies. On 28 September 2020 we estimated 15,841 (95% CI 14,023-17,885) daily cases, a prevalence of 0.53% (95% CI 0.45-0.60), and R(t) of 1.17 (95% credible interval 1.15-1.19) in England. On a geographically granular level, on 28 September 2020 we detected 15 of the 20 regions with highest incidence according to Government test data, with indications that our method may be able to detect rapid case increases in regions where Government testing provision is more limited.

InterpretationSelf-reported data from mobile applications can provide an agile resource to inform policymakers during a fast-moving pandemic, serving as an independent and complementary resource to more traditional instruments for disease surveillance.

Of the 382 results, we found eight that utilised user-reported data to ascertain a users COVID-19 status. Of these, none sought to provide disease surveillance on a national level, or to compare these predictions to other tools to ascertain their accuracy. Furthermore, none of these papers sought to use their data to highlight geographical areas of concern.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, we provide the first demonstration of mobile technology to provide national-level disease surveillance. Using over 120 million reports from more than 2.8 million users across England, we estimate incidence, prevalence, and the effective reproduction number. We compare these estimates to those from national community surveys to understand the effectiveness of these digital tools. Furthermore, we demonstrate the large number of users can be used to provide disease surveillance with high geographical granularity, potentially providing a valuable source of information for policymakers seeking to understand the spread of the disease.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur findings suggest that mobile technology can be used to provide real-time data on the national and local state of the pandemic, enabling policymakers to make informed decisions in a fast-moving pandemic.","Varsavsky, T.; Graham, M.

8601,ON THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HERD IMMUNITY LEVELS REQUIRED TO STOP COVID-19 EPIDEMICS,"COVID-19 evolved into a pandemic in 2020 affecting more than 150 countries. Given the absence of a vaccine, discussion has taken place on the strategy of allowing the virus to spread in a population, to increase population """"herd immunity"""". Knowledge of the minimum proportion of a population required to have recovered from COVID-19 infection in order to attain """"herd"""" immunity, Pcrit, is important for formulating epidemiological policy. A method for measuring uncertainty about Pcrit based on a widely used package, EpiEstim, is derived. The procedure is illustrated using data from twelve countries at two early times during the COVID-19 epidemic. It is shown that simple plug-in measures of confidence on estimates of Pcrit are misleading, but that a full characterization of statistical uncertainty can be derived from EpiEstim, which reports percentiles only. Because of the important levels of uncertainty, it is risky to design epidemiological policy based on guidance provided by a single point estimate.","Gianola, D.",2020-06-01,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.31.20118695,1,Daniel Gianola,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.31.20118695v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.31.20118695v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
4336,Intervention strategies against COVID-19 and their estimated impact on Swedish healthcare capacity,"ObjectivesDuring March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread globally, and non-pharmaceutical interventions are being used to reduce both the load on the healthcare system as well as overall mortality.

DesignIndividual-based transmission modelling using Swedish demographic and Geographical Information System data and conservative COVID-19 epidemiological parameters.

SettingSweden

ParticipantsA model to simulate all 10.09 million Swedish residents.

Interventions5 different non-pharmaceutical public-health interventions including the mitigation strategy of the Swedish government as of 10 April; isolation of the entire household of confirmed cases; closure of schools and non-essential businesses with or without strict social distancing; and strict social distancing with closure of schools and non-essential businesses.

Main outcome measuresEstimated acute care and intensive care hospitalisations, COVID-19 attributable deaths, and infections among healthcare workers from 10 April until 29 June.

FindingsOur model for Sweden shows that, under conservative epidemiological parameter estimates, the current Swedish public-health strategy will result in a peak intensive-care load in May that exceeds pre-pandemic capacity by over 40-fold, with a median mortality of 96,000 (95% CI 52,000 to 183,000). The most stringent public-health measures examined are predicted to reduce mortality by approximately three-fold. Intensive-care load at the peak could be reduced by over two-fold with a shorter period at peak pandemic capacity.

ConclusionsOur results predict that, under conservative epidemiological parameter estimates, current measures in Sweden will result in at least 40-fold over-subscription of pre-pandemic Swedish intensive care capacity, with 15.8 percent of Swedish healthcare workers unable to work at the pandemic peak. Modifications to ICU admission criteria from international norms would further increase mortality.

What is already known?- The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly in Europe and globally since March 2020.
- Mitigation and suppression methods have been suggested to slow down or halt the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most European countries have enacted strict suppression measures including lockdown, school closures, enforced social distancing; while Sweden has chosen a different strategy of milder mitigation as of today (10 April 2020).
- Different national policy decisions have been justified by socio-geographic differences among countries. Such differences as well as the tempo and stringency of public-health interventions are likely to affect the impact on each countrys mortality and healthcare system.


What this study adds?- Individual-based modelling of COVID-19 spread using Swedish demographics and conservative epidemiological assumptions indicates that the peak of the number of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 can be expected in early May under the current strategy, shifted earlier and attenuated with more stringent public health measures.
- Healthcare needs are expected to substantially exceed pre-pandemic capacity even if the most aggressive interventions considered were implemented in the coming weeks. In particular the need for intensive care unit beds will be at least 40-fold greater than the pre-pandemic capacity if the current strategy is maintained, and at least 10-fold greater if strategies approximating the most stringent in Europe are introduced by 10 April.
- Our model predicts that, using median infection-fatality-rate estimates, at least 96,000 deaths would occur by 1 July without mitigation. Current policies reduce this number by approximately 15%, while even more aggressive social distancing measures, such as adding household isolation or mandated social distancing can reduce this number by more than 50%.","Gardner, J.

MethodsMedicare claims data was used to identify patients age 65 years or older with diagnosis of COVID-19 between April 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020. Demographic characteristics, chronic medical conditions, and other patient risk factors that existed before the advent of COVID-19 were identified. A random forest model was used to empirically explore factors associated with COVID-19 death. The independent impact of factors identified were quantified using multivariate logistic regression with random effects.

ResultsWe identified 534,023 COVID-19 patients of whom 38,066 had an inpatient death. Demographic characteristics associated with COVID-19 death included advanced age (85 years or older: aOR: 2.07; 95% CI, 1.99-2.16), male sex (aOR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.82-1.94), and non-white race (Hispanic: aOR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.66-1.83). Leading comorbidities associated with COVID-19 mortality included sickle cell disease (aOR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.21-2.47), chronic kidney disease (aOR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.29-1.36), leukemias and lymphomas (aOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.14-1.30), heart failure (aOR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.16-1.22), and diabetes (aOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.15-1.22).

ConclusionsWe created a personalized risk prediction calculator to identify candidates for early vaccine and therapeutics allocation (www.predictcovidrisk.com). These findings may be used to protect those at greatest risk of death from COVID-19.","Dun, C.; Walsh, C.; Bae, S.; Adalja, A.; Toner, E.; Lash, T. A.; Hashim, F.; Paturzo, J.; Segev, D.

4597,Epidemic Landscape and Forecasting of SARS-CoV-2 in India,"BACKGROUNDIndia was one of the countries to institute strict measures for SARS-CoV-2 control in early phase. Since, then, the epidemic growth trajectory was slow before registering an explosion of cases due to local cluster transmissions.

METHODSWe estimated growth rate and doubling time of SARS-CoV-2 for India and high burden states using crowd sourced time series data. Further, we also estimated Basic Reproductive Number (R0) and time dependent reproductive number (Rt) using serial intervals from the data. We compared the R0 estimated from five different methods and R0 from SB was further used in analysis. We modified standard SIR models to SIRD model to accommodate deaths using R0 with the Sequential Bayesian method (SBM) for simulation in SIRD models.

RESULTSOn an average, 2.8 individuals were infected by an index case. The mean serial interval was 3.9 days. The R0 estimated from different methods ranged from 1.43 to 1.85. The mean time to recovery was 14 {+/-} 5.3 days. Daily epidemic growth rate of India was 0.16 [95%CI; 0.14, 0.17] with a doubling time of 4.30 days [95%CI; 3.96, 4.70]. From the SIRD model, it can be deduced that the peak of SARS-CoV-2 in India will be around mid-July to early August 2020 with around 12.5% of population likely to be infected at the peak time.

CONCLUSIONSThe pattern of spread of SARS-CoV-2 in India is suggestive of community transmission. There is a need to increase fund for infectious disease research and epidemiologic studies. All the current gains may be reversed rapidly if air travel and social mixing resumes rapidly. For the time being, these must be resumed only in a phased manner, and should be back to normal levels only after we are prepared to deal with the disease with efficient tools like vaccine or a medicine.","Lathika Rajendrakumar, A.; Thakarakkattil Narayanan Nair, A.; Nangia, C.; Kumar Chourasia, P.; Kumar Chourasia, M.; Ghouse Syed, M.; Sasidharan Nair, A.; B Nair, A.; Fazaludeen Koya, M.

19672,Acceptability and feasibility of strategies to shield the vulnerable during the COVID-19 outbreak: a qualitative study in six Sudanese communities,"BackgroundShielding of high-risk groups from coronavirus disease (COVID-19), either within their households or safe communal structures, has been suggested as a realistic alternative to severe movement restrictions in response to the COVID-19 epidemic in low-income countries. To our knowledge, this concept has not been tested or evaluated in resource-poor settings. This study aimed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of strategies to shield persons at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, during the COVID-19 epidemic in six communities in Sudan.

MethodsWe purposively sampled participants from six communities, illustrative of urban, rural and forcibly-displaced settings. In-depth telephone interviews were held with 59 members of households with one or more members at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Follow-up interviews were held with 30 community members after movement restrictions were eased across the country. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using a two-stage deductive and inductive thematic analysis.

ResultsMost participants were aware that some people are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes but were unaware of the concept of shielding. Most participants found shielding acceptable and consistent with cultural inclinations to respect elders and protect the vulnerable. However, extra-household shielding arrangements were mostly seen as socially unacceptable. Participants reported feasibility concerns related to the social isolation of shielded persons and loss of income for shielding families. The acceptability and feasibility of shielding strategies were reduced after movement restrictions were eased, as participants reported lower perception of risk in their communities and increased pressure to comply with social commitments outside the house.

ConclusionShielding is generally acceptable in the study communities. Acceptability is influenced by feasibility, and by contextual changes in the epidemic and associated policy response. The promotion of shielding should capitalise on the cultural and moral sense of duty towards elders and vulnerable groups. Communities and households should be provided with practical guidance to implement feasible shielding options. Households must be socially, psychologically and financially supported to adopt and sustain shielding effectively.","Abdelmagid, N.; Ahmed, S. A.

15657,SCOAT-Net: A Novel Network for Segmenting COVID-19 Lung Opacification from CT Images,"The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide at a rapid rate. There is no clinically automated tool to quantify the infection of COVID-19 patients. Automatic segmentation of lung opacification from computed tomography (CT) images provides excellent potential, which is of great significance for judging the disease development and treatment response of the patients. However, the segmentation of lung opacification from CT slices still faces some challenges, including the complexity and variability features of the opacity regions, the small difference between the infected and healthy tissues, and the noise of CT images. Besides, due to the limited medical resources, it is impractical to obtain a large amount of data in a short time, which further hinders the training of deep learning models. To answer these challenges, we proposed a novel spatial and channel-wise coarse-to-fine attention network (SCOAT-Net) inspired by the biological vision mechanism, which is for the segmentation of COVID-19 lung opacification from CT Images. SCOAT-Net has the spatial-wise attention module and the channel-wise attention module to attract the self-attention learning of the network, which serves to extract the practical features at the pixel and channel level successfully. Experiments show that our proposed SCOAT-Net achieves better results compared to state-of-the-art image segmentation networks.","Zhao, S.; Li, Z.; Chen, Y.; Zhao, W.; Xie, X.; Liu, J.; Zhao, D.; Li, Y.",2020-10-19,Radiology And Imaging,10.1101/2020.09.23.20191726,3,Yongjie Li,"MOE Key Lab for Neuroinformation, School of Life Science and Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.23.20191726v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.23.20191726v3.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
18519,The Invasive Respiratory Infection Surveillance (IRIS) Initiative reveals significant reductions in invasive bacterial infections during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BackgroundStreptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis are leading causes of invasive diseases including bacteraemic pneumonia and meningitis, and of secondary infections post-viral respiratory disease. They are typically transmitted via respiratory droplets. We investigated rates of invasive disease due to these pathogens during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsLaboratories in 26 countries across six continents submitted data on cases of invasive disease due to S pneumoniae, H influenzae and N meningitidis from 1 January 2018 to 31 May 2020. Weekly cases in 2020 vs 2018-2019 were compared. Streptococcus agalactiae data were collected from nine laboratories for comparison to a non-respiratory pathogen. The stringency of COVID-19 containment measures was quantified by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Changes in population movements were assessed by Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports. Interrupted time series modelling quantified changes in rates of invasive disease in 2020 relative to when containment measures were imposed.

FindingsAll countries experienced a significant, sustained reduction in invasive diseases due to S pneumoniae, H influenzae and N meningitidis, but not S agalactiae, in early 2020, which coincided with the introduction of COVID-19 containment measures in each country. Similar impacts were observed across most countries despite differing stringency in COVID-19 control policies. There was no evidence of a specific effect due to enforced school closures.

InterpretationThe introduction of COVID-19 containment policies and public information campaigns likely reduced transmission of these bacterial respiratory pathogens, leading to a significant reduction in life-threatening invasive diseases in many countries worldwide.","Brueggemann, A.

23801,Hospitalization of mild cases of community-acquired pneumonia decreased more than severe ones during the COVID-19 epidemic,"ObjectiveThe epidemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected the entire health care systems. Our aim was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the number and severity of cases for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Japan.

MethodsUsing claims data from the Quality Indicator/Improvement Project (QIP) database, we included urgent cases of inpatients for CAP from August 1, 2018, to July 30, 2020. We compared the monthly ratio of inpatient cases from August 2018 to July 2019 and August 2019 to July 2020 as a year-over-year comparison. We also compared this ratio according to the severity score """"A-DROP"""" and performed an interrupted time series analysis (ITS) to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the monthly number of inpatient cases.

ResultsA total of 67,900 inpatient cases for CAP in 262 hospitals were included. During the COVID-19 epidemic (defined as the period between March and July 2020), the number of inpatient cases for CAP drastically decreased during the epidemic compared with the same period in the past year (-48.1%), despite only a temporary reduction in the number of other urgent admissions. The number of inpatient cases decreased according to the severity of pneumonia. Milder cases showed a greater decrease in the year-over-year ratio than severe ones (mild -55.2%, moderate -45.8%, severe -39.4%, and extremely severe - 33.2%). The ITS analysis showed that the COVID-19 epidemic reduced the monthly number of inpatient cases for CAP significantly (estimated decrease: -1233 cases; 95% CI, -521 to -1955).

ConclusionsOur study showed a significant reduction in the number of inpatient cases for CAP during the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan. The milder cases showed a greater decrease in the year-over-year ratio of the number of inpatient cases.","Nagano, H.; Takada, D.; Shin, J.-H.; Morishita, T.; Kunisawa, S.; Imanaka, Y.",2021-03-20,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.03.18.21253861,1,Yuichi Imanaka,"Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.18.21253861v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.18.21253861v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
9348,Quantifying hospital flows and occupancy due to COVID-19 outbreak in France. Was French lockdown effective?,"ContextThe spread of SARS-CoV-2 led to a rapid and deadly pandemic which reached almost all countries in the world in a few months. In most countries, rigorous measures of mitigation, including national or subnational lockdowns were established. The present work aimed at quantifying the effect of national lockdown in France on hospital occupancy.

MethodsA compartmental model describing patient hospital flows was developed, where the effect of lockdown was quantified on the hospitalization rate. Model parameters were estimated using nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) modelling.

ResultsFrench lockdown led to a hospitalization rate decreased by thrice from 12 days after its beginning. However, lockdown may not to have decreased either hospital occupancy or deaths in hospital, which would have been both decreased by 30% and 85% in average if lockdown was started 20 and 30 days before this date, respectively.

ConclusionThe present work showed an intrinsic effect of lockdown to decrease hospital burden, but its efficacy on hospital burden may have been increased if established sooner.","Ternant, D.",2020-06-19,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.06.08.20125765,2,David Ternant,University of Tours,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.08.20125765v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.08.20125765v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

We tested the hypothesis that meteorological factors (air temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, wind speed and rainfall) are independently associated with transmissibility of COVID-19 quantified using the basic reproduction rate (R0). We used publicly available datasets on daily COVID-19 case counts (total n = 108,308), three-hourly meteorological data and community mobility data over a three-month period. Estimated R0 varied between 1.15-1.28. Mean daily air temperature (inversely) and wind speed (positively) were significantly associated with time dependent R0, but the contribution of countrywide lockdown to variability in R0 was over three times stronger as compared to that of temperature and wind speed combined. Thus, abating temperatures and easing lockdown may concur with increased transmissibility of COVID-19.","Kulkarni, H.; Khandait, H. V.; Narlawar, U. W.; Rathod, P.

16471,Evaluation of saliva sampling procedures for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics reveals differential sensitivity and association with viral load,"Nasopharyngeal sampling has been the preferential collection method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. Alternative sampling procedures that are less invasive and do not require a healthcare professional would be more preferable for patients and health professionals. Saliva collection has been proposed as such a possible alternative sampling procedure. We evaluated the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing on two different saliva collection devices (spitting versus swabbing) compared to nasopharyngeal swabs in over 2500 individuals that were either symptomatic or had high-risk contacts with infected individuals. We observed an overall poor sensitivity in saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection (30.8% and 22.4% for spitting and swabbing, respectively). However, when focusing on individuals with medium to high viral load, sensitivity increased substantially (97.0% and 76.7% for spitting and swabbing, respectively), irrespective of symptomatic status. Our results suggest that saliva cannot readily replace nasopharyngeal sampling for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics but may enable identification of cases with medium to high viral loads.","Mestdagh, P.; Gillard, M.; Arbyn, M.; Pirnay, J.-P.; Poels, J.; Hellemans, J.; Peeters, E.; Hutse, V.; Vermeiren, C.; Boutier, M.; De Wever, V.; Soentjens, P.; Djebara, S.; Malonne, H.; Andre, E.; Smeraglia, J.; Vandesompele, J.",2020-10-13,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.06.20207902,1,Pieter Mestdagh,Ghent University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.06.20207902v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.06.20207902v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
13514,Sixty-day mortality among 520 Italian hospitalized COVID-19 patients according to the adopted ventilatory strategy in the context of an integrated multidisciplinary clinical organization: a population-based cohort study,"BackgroundAmong COVID-19 patients, the decision of which ventilation strategy to adopt is crucial and not guided by existing outcome evidence. We described the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients according to the adopted respiratory strategy.

MethodsPopulation-based cohort study including all COVID-19 patients (26/02/2020-18/04/2020) within Rimini Italian province. Hospitalized patients were classified according to the maximum level of respiratory support: oxygen supplementation (group Oxygen), NIV (group NIV-only), IMV (group IMV-only), and IMV after a NIV trial (group IMV-after-NIV). Sixty-day mortality risk was estimated with a Cox proportional hazard analysis adjusted by age, sex, and administration of steroids, canakinumab, and tocilizumab.

FindingsWe identified 1,424 symptomatic patients: 520 (36.5%) were hospitalized, the remaining 904 (63.5%) were treated at home with no 60-days death. According to the respiratory support, 408 (78.5%) were assigned to Oxygen, 46 (8.8%) to NIV-only, 25 (4.8%) to IMV-after-NIV, and 41 (7.9%) to IMV-only groups. There was no significant difference in the P/F at IMV inception among IMV-after-NIV and IMV-only groups (p=0.9). Overall 60-day mortality was 24.2% (Oxygen: 23.0%; NIV-only: 19.6%; IMV-after-NIV: 32.0%; IMV-only: 36.6%; p = 0.165). Compared with Oxygen group, the 60-day mortality risk significantly increased for IMV-after-NIV (HR 2.776; p=0.024) and IMV-only group (HR 2.966; p=0.001).

ConclusionsThis study provides a population-based figure of the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic. A similar 60-days mortality risk was found for patients undergoing immediate IMV and those intubated after a NIV trial.

16024,Seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2 Antibodies in Scottish Healthcare Workers,"IntroductionHealthcare workers are believed to be at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The extent of that increased risk compared to the general population and the groups most at risk have not been extensively studied.

MethodsA prospective observational study of health and social care workers in NHS Tayside (Scotland, UK) from May to September 2020. The Siemens SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay was used to establish seroprevalence in this cohort. Patients provided clinical information including demographics and workplace information. Controls, matched for age and sex to the general Tayside population, were studied for comparison.

ResultsA total of 2062 health and social care workers were recruited for this study. The participants were predominantly female (81.7%) and 95.2% were white. 299 healthcare workers had a positive antibody test (14.5%). 11 out of 231 control sera tested positive (4.8%). Healthcare workers therefore had an increased likelihood of a positive test (odds ratio 3.4 95% CI 1.85-6.16, p<0.0001). Dentists, healthcare assistants and porters were the job roles most likely to test positive. Those working in front-line roles with COVID-19 patients were more likely to test positive (17.4% vs. 13.4%, p=0.02). 97.1% of patients who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR had positive antibodies, compared to 11.8% of individuals with a symptomatic illness who had tested negative. Anosmia was the symptom most associated with the presence of detectable antibodies.

ConclusionIn this study, healthcare workers were three times more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. The seroprevalence data in different populations identified in this study will be useful to protect healthcare staff during future waves of the pandemic.","Abo-Leyah, H.; Gallant, S.; Cassidy, D.; Giam, Y.

2223,Association of Cardiovascular Manifestations with In-hospital Outcomes in Patients with COVID-19: A Hospital Staff Data,"BackgroundThe outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain a huge threat to the public health worldwide. Clinical data is limited up to now regarding nosocomial infection of COVID-19 and the risk factors in favor of severe conversion of non-severe case with COVID-19.

AimsThis study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features of COVID-19 in terms of nosocomial infection and explain the association of cardiovascular manifestations (CVMs) with in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases.

MethodsRetrospective, single-center case series of 41 consecutive hospitalized health staff with confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the Central Hospital of Wuhan in Wuhan, China, from January 15 to January 24, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data and in-hospital adverse events were collected and analyzed. Final date of follow-up was March 3, 2020. A comparative study was applied between cases with CVMs and those without CVMs.

ResultsOf all, clinicians and clinical nurses accounted for 80.5%, while nosocomial infection by patient contact accounted for 87.8%. The population was presented with a mean age of 39.1 {+/-} 9.2 and less comorbidities than community population. The three most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 cases analyzed were fever (82.9%), myalgia or fatigue (80.5%) and cough (63.4%). While, the three most frequent initial symptoms were myalgia or fatigue (80.5%), fever (73.2%) and cough (41.5%). There were 95.1% cases featured as non-severe course of disease according to the official standard in China. Patients with CVMs and those without CVMs accounted for 58.5% and 41.5%, respectively. Compared with cases without CVMs, patients with CVMs were presented with lower baseline lymphocyte count (0.99 {+/-} 0.43 and 1.55 {+/-} 0.61, P<0.001), more who had at least once positive nucleic acid detection of throat swab during admission (50.0% and 11.8%, P=0.011), and more received oxygen support (79.2% and 23.5%, P<0.001). The rate of in-hospital adverse events was significantly higher in patients with CVMs group (75.0% and 23.5%, P=0.001). Multivariable logistic regression model indicated that, coexisting with CVMs in COVID-19 patients was not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events.

ConclusionsMost of hospital staff with COVID-19 were nosocomial infection, featured non-severe course of disease. Cases with CVMs suffered from more in-hospital adverse events than those without CVMs. But concomitant CVMs were not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events in COVID-19 patients.","Liu, R.; Ming, X.; Xu, O.; Zhou, J.; Peng, H.; Xiang, N.; Zhang, J.; Zhu, H.",2020-03-12,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.02.29.20029348,5,Jinqing Yuan,"Department of Cardiology, Fuwai Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029348v5?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029348v5.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
21575,Development and external validation of prognostic models for COVID-19 to support risk stratification in secondary care,"ObjectivesExisting UK prognostic models for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 are limited by reliance on comorbidities, which are under-recorded in secondary care, and lack of imaging data among the candidate predictors. Our aims were to develop and externally validate novel prognostic models for adverse outcomes (death, intensive therapy unit (ITU) admission) in UK secondary care; and externally validate the existing 4C score.

DesignCandidate predictors included demographic variables, symptoms, physiological measures, imaging, laboratory tests. Final models used logistic regression with stepwise selection.

SettingModel development was performed in data from University Hospitals Birmingham (UHB). External validation was performed in the CovidCollab dataset.

ParticipantsPatients with COVID-19 admitted to UHB January-August 2020 were included.

Main outcome measuresDeath and ITU admission within 28 days of admission.

Results1040 patients with COVID-19 were included in the derivation cohort; 288 (28%) died and 183 (18%) were admitted to ITU within 28 days of admission. Area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) for mortality was 0.791 (95%CI 0.761-0.822) in UHB and 0.767 (95%CI 0.754-0.780) in CovidCollab; AUROC for ITU admission was 0.906 (95%CI 0.883-0.929) in UHB and 0.811 (95%CI 0.795-0.828) in CovidCollab. Models showed good calibration. Addition of comorbidities to candidate predictors did not improve model performance. AUROC for the 4C score in the UHB dataset was 0.754 (95%CI 0.721-0.786).

ConclusionsThe novel prognostic models showed good discrimination and calibration in derivation and external validation datasets, and outperformed the existing 4C score. The models can be integrated into electronic medical records systems to calculate each individual patients probability of death or ITU admission at the time of hospital admission. Implementation of the models and clinical utility should be evaluated.

Article SummaryO_ST_ABSStrengths and limitations of this studyC_ST_ABSO_LIWe developed novel prognostic models predicting mortality and ITU admission within 28 days of admission for patients hospitalised with COVID-19, using a large routinely collected dataset gathered at admission with a wide range of possible predictors (demographic variables, symptoms, physiological measures, imaging, laboratory test results).
C_LIO_LIThese novel models showed good discrimination and calibration in both derivation and external validation cohorts, and outperformed the existing ISARIC model and 4C score in the derivation dataset. We found that addition of comorbidities to the set of candidate predictors included in model derivation did not improve model performance.
C_LIO_LIIf integrated into hospital electronic medical records systems, the model algorithms will provide a predicted probability of mortality or ITU admission for each patient based on their individual data at, or close to, the time of admission, which will support clinicians decision making with regard to appropriate patient care pathways and triage. This information might also assist clinicians in explaining complex prognostic assessments and decisions to patients and their relatives.
C_LIO_LIA limitation of the study was that in the external validation cohort we were unable to examine all of the predictors included in the original full UHB model due to only a reduced set of candidate predictors being available in CovidCollab. Nevertheless, the reduced model performed well and the results suggest it may be applicable in a wide range of datasets where only a reduced set of predictor variables is available.
C_LIO_LIFurthermore, it was not possible to carry out stratified analysis by ethnicity as the UHB dataset contained too few patients in most of the strata, and no ethnicity data was available in the CovidCollab dataset.

25394,Model-based evaluation of alternative reactive class closure strategies against COVID-19,"There are contrasting results concerning the effect of reactive school closure on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. To shed light on this controversy, here we develop a data-driven computational model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to investigate mechanistically the effect on COVID-19 outbreaks of school closure strategies based on syndromic surveillance and antigen screening of students. We found that by reactively closing classes based on syndromic surveillance, SARS-CoV-2 infections are reduced by no more than 13.1% (95%CI: 8.6%-20.2 %), due to the low probability of timely symptomatic case identification among the young population. We thus investigated an alternative triggering mechanism based on repeated screening of students using antigen tests. Should population-level social distancing measures unrelated to schools enable maintaining the reproduction number (R) at 1.3 or lower, an antigen-based screening strategy is estimated to fully prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in the general population. Depending on the contribution of schools to transmission, this strategy can either prevent COVID-19 outbreaks for R up to 1.9 or to at least greatly reduce outbreak size in very conservative scenarios about school contribution to transmission. Moving forward, the adoption of antigen-based screenings in schools could be instrumental to limit COVID-19 burden while vaccines continue to roll out through 2021, especially in light of possible continued emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Liu, Q.; Zhang, J.; Peng, C.; Litvinova, M.; Huang, S.; Poletti, P.; Trentini, F.; Guzzetta, G.; Marziano, V.; Zhou, T.; Viboud, C.; Bento, A.

18145,Excess mortality for care home residents during the first 23 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in England: a national cohort study,"BackgroundTo estimate excess mortality for care home residents during the COVID-19 pandemic in England, exploring associations with care home characteristics.

MethodsDaily number of deaths in all residential and nursing homes in England notified to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) from 1st January 2017 to 7th August 2020. Care home level data linked with CQC care home register to identify homes characteristics: client type (over 65s/children and adults), ownership status (for-profit/not-for-profit; branded/independent), and size (small/medium/large).

Excess deaths computed as the difference between observed and predicted deaths using local authority fixed-effect Poisson regressions on pre-pandemic data. Fixed-effect logistic regressions were used to model odds of experiencing COVID-19 suspected/confirmed deaths.

FindingsUp to 7th August 2020 there were 29,542 (95%CI: 25,176 to 33,908) excess deaths in all care homes. Excess deaths represented 6.5% (95%CI: 5.5% to 7.4%) of all care home beds, higher in nursing (8.4%) than residential (4.6%) homes. 64.7% (95%CI: 56.4% to 76.0%) of the excess deaths were confirmed/suspected COVID-19. Almost all excess deaths were recorded in the quarter (27.4%) of homes with any COVID-19 fatalities.

The odds of experiencing COVID-19 attributable deaths were higher in homes providing nursing services (OR: 1.8, 95%CI: 1.6 to 2.0); to older people and/or with dementia (OR: 5.5, 95%CI: 4.4 to 6.8); among larger (vs. small) homes (OR: 13.3, 95%CI: 11.5 to 15.4); belonging to a large provider/brand (OR: 1.2, 95%CI: 1.1 to 1.3). There was no significant association with for-profit status of providers.

InterpretationTo limit excess mortality, policy should be targeted at care homes to minimise the risk of ingress of disease and limit subsequent transmission. Our findings provide specific characteristic targets for further research on mechanisms and policy priority.

FundingNIHR.

Summary boxO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSGlobally, residents in care homes have experienced disproportionately high morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. Excess mortality incorporates all direct and indirect mortality effects of the pandemic.

We searched MEDLINE for published literature, pre-publication databases (medRxiv and Lancet pre-print) and grey literature (ONS and Google) for care homes AND COVID-19 AND mortality, to 31st October 2020. We screened for evidence on excess deaths in care homes in England, and international evidence of the association of COVID-19 deaths and outbreaks with care home characteristics.

Official estimates from England and Wales have reported aggregated excess deaths by place of occurrence, but we identified no peer-reviewed excess deaths study in this setting. These aggregates, however, do not account for care home residents dying in other settings (e.g. hospital), nor provide sufficient information to reflect on the impacts of enacted policies over the period, or to inform new policies for future virus waves.

Previous peer-reviewed and pre-publication studies have also shown the heterogeneous effects of COVID-19 by care home characteristics in other countries. Particularly important from the current literature appears to be care home size, with larger care homes tending to be associated with more negative outcomes in studies with smaller sample sizes. A study from the Lothian region of Scotland additionally found excess deaths concentrated in a minority of homes that experienced an outbreak. However, a national breakdown of excess deaths by care home characteristics is largely lacking from the current literature in England, with a specific market structure and policy context.

Added value of this studyWe use nationally representative administrative data from all care homes in England to estimate overall excess deaths and by care home characteristics: setting type (nursing or residential home), client types (offering services for people aged 65+ and/or people with dementia or offering services to children and adults), ownership status (whether not-for-profit - charity/NHS/LA-run homes - or for-profit), whether known to be affiliated to a large provider/brand or independent, and classification according to their registered maximum bed capacity (small, medium and large).

We then used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the adjusted odds of a care home experiencing a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 death across these characteristics.

We found that only 65% of excess deaths were flagged as officially confirmed/suspected COVID-19 attributed. However, almost all excess deaths occurred in the roughly quarter of care homes that reported at least one suspected/confirmed COVID-19 death. After adjusting for other care home characteristics, larger care homes (vs. small) had the highest odds of experiencing at least one suspected/confirmed COVID-19 death. These findings confirm those from the previous literature, in a unique policy context and with national data.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe fact that nearly all excess deaths occurred in care homes with at least one COVID-19 attributed death suggests that directly-attributed deaths are very likely to be under-recorded. It also suggests that any indirect mortality effect, of COVID-19 and any enacted policies, were predominantly constrained to those homes experiencing an outbreak.

Larger homes are likely to experience higher footfall in general, and so higher probability of contact with an infected individual, which is likely a contributing factor to the association. Furthermore, it might be easier to ensure person-centred protocols in small care homes due to the scale.

There is an urgent need for further research to explore the mechanisms in relation to care home characteristics. Also, to empirically test effective interventions, in consideration of additional impacts on quality of life and psychological wellbeing. However, until this is possible, prioritising existing resources, such as testing and PPE equipment, for care homes to prevent ingress of disease is key to preventing large excess mortality.","Morciano, M.; Stokes, J.

6340,Contact tracing and isolation of asymptomatic spreaders to successfully control the COVID-19 epidemic among healthcare workers in Milan (Italy),"ObjectiveTo study the source, symptoms, and duration of infection, preventive measures, contact tracing and their effects on SARS-CoV-2 epidemic among healthcare workers (HCW) in 2 large hospitals and 40 external healthcare services in Milan (Italy) to propose effective measures to control the COVID-19 epidemic among healthcare workers.

DesignEpidemiological observational study.

SettingTwo large hospitals and 40 territorial healthcare units, with a total of 5700 workers.

Participants143 HCWs with a SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal (NF) swab in a population made of 5,700 HCWs.

Main outcome measuresClinical data on the history of exposure, contacts inside and outside of the hospital, NF swab dates and results. A daily online self-reported case report form consisting of the morning and evening body temperature and 11 other symptoms (cough, dyspnoea, discomfort, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhoea, anosmia, dysgeusia, conjunctival hyperaemia).

ResultsMost workers were tested and found positive due to a close contact with a positive colleague (49%), followed by worker-initiated testing due to symptoms (and unknown contact, 28%), and a SARS-CoV-2 positive member of the family (9.8%). 10% of NF swabs performed in the framework of contact tracing resulted positive, compared to only 2.6% through random testing. The first (index) case caused a cluster of 7 positive HCWs discovered through contact tracing and testing of 250 asymptomatic HCWs. HCWs rarely reported symptoms of a respiratory infection, and up to 90% were asymptomatic or with mild symptoms in the days surrounding the positive NF swab. During the 15-day follow-up period, up to 40% of HCWs reported anosmia and dysgeusia/ageusia as moderate or heavy, more frequently than any other symptom. The time necessary for 95% of HCWs to be considered cured (between the positive and two negative NF swabs) was 30 days.

ConclusionHCWs represent the main source of infection in healthcare institutions, 90% are asymptomatic or with symptoms not common in a respiratory infection. The time needed to overcome the infection in 95% of workers was 30 days. Contact tracing allows identifying asymptomatic workers which would spread SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital and is a more successful strategy than random testing.

What is already known on this topic?There are more than 3 million SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and more than 200,000 deaths attributed to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) worldwide.

Commonly reported symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, muscle pain, discomfort, and many prevention strategies are based on identifying these symptoms of infection.

The virus can be spread even by asymptomatic patients or patients with mild symptoms, and healthcare workers (HCWs) represent 10% of overall cases and often more than 10% of hospital personnel are commonly infected.

HCWs represent both a vulnerable population and an irreplaceable resource in the fight against this epidemic and further analysis is needed to show how and why they get infected and introduce successful prevention measures.

What this study adds?The first (index) case in our study was infected by a family member, but due to close contacts with colleagues managed to infect other 7 HCWs. Contrary to a common expectation that HCWs get infected from patients, they regularly get infected by other HCWs.

Up to 90% of HCWs were asymptomatic or had only mild symptoms. Random testing for SARS-CoV-2 was not efficient. Active search for suspect cases through contact tracing is the strategy of choice to identify most of the positive HCWs.

Most HCWs remained asymptomatic during the 15-day follow-up period, and even in the days prior to the positive NF swab. Anosmia and ageusia/dysgeusia were reported more commonly than classic symptoms of a respiratory infection.

Contrary to the recommended quarantine of 14 days, 30 days were necessary for 95% of the workers to be declared cured (two negative NF swabs)","Mandic-Rajcevic, S.; Masci, F.; Crespi, E.; Franchetti, S.; Longo, A.; Bollina, I.; Veloci, S.; Amorosi, A.; Baldelli, R.; Boselli, L.; Negroni, L.; Za, A.; Orfeo, N.

14194,Covid-19 Social Distancing Interventions by State Mandate and their Correlation to Mortality in the United States,"BackgroundEvaluate the correlation between U.S. state mandated social interventions and Covid-19 mortality using a retrospective analysis of Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) data.

MethodsTwenty-seven (27) states in the United States were selected on June 17, 2020 from IHME data which had clearly defined and dated establishment of statewide mandates for social distancing measures to include: School closures, Prohibition on mass gatherings, business closures, stay at home orders, severe travel restrictions, and closure of non-essential businesses. The state Covid-19 mortality prevalence was defined as total normalized deaths to the peak daily mortality rate. The state mortality prevalence was correlated to the total number of mandates-days from their date of establishment to the peak daily mortality date. The slope of the maximum daily mortality rate was also correlated to mandate-days.

ResultsThe standardized mortality per state to the initial peak mortality rate did not demonstrate a discernable correlation to the total mandate days (R2 = 0.000006, p= 0.995). The standardized peak mortality rate per state suggested a slight correlation to the total mandate days (R2 = 0.053,p=0.246), but was not statistically significant. There was a significant correlation between standardized mortality and state population density (R2 = 0.524,p=0.00002).

ConclusionsThe analysis appears to suggest no mandate effective reduction in Covid-19 mortality nor a reduction in Covid-19 mortality rate to its defined initial peak when interpreting the mean-effect of the mandates as present in the data. A strong correlation to population density suggests human interaction frequency does affect the total mortality and maximum mortality rate.

20919,Optimal piecewise constant vaccination and lockdown policies for COVID-19,"We formulate a controlled system of ordinary differential equations, with vaccination and lockdown interventions as controls, to simulate the mitigation of COVID-19. The performance of the controls is measured through a cost functional involving vaccination and lockdown costs as well as the burden of COVID19 quantified in DALYs. We calibrate parameters with data from Mexico City and Valle de Mexico. By using differential evolution, we minimize the cost functional subject to the controlled system and find optimal policies that are constant in time intervals of a given size. The main advantage of these policies relies on its practical implementation since the health authority has to make only a finite number of different decisions. Our methodology to find optimal policies is relatively general, allowing changes in the dynamics, the cost functional, or the frequency the policymaker changes actions.","Salcedo-Varea, G.

3881,Derivation of the effective reproduction number R for COVID-19 in relation to mobility restrictions and confinement,"The spread of COVID-19 is posing an unprecedented threat to health systems worldwide1. The fast propagation of the disease combined with the existence of covert contagions by asymptomatic individuals make the controlling of this disease particularly challenging. The key parameter to track the progression of the epidemics is the effective reproduction number [R], defined as the number of secondary infections generated by an infected individual2. The suppression of the epidemics is directly related to this value, and is attained when [R] < 1. Here, we find an analytical expression for [R] as a function of mobility restrictions and confinement measures, using an epidemic model tailored for COVID-19. This expression for [R] is an extremely useful tool to design containment policies that are able to suppress the epidemics. We applied our epidemic model for the case of Spain, successfully forecasting both the observed incidence in each region and the overload of the health system. The expression for [R] allowed us to determine the precise reduction of mobility{kappa} 0 needed to bend the curve of epidemic incidence, which turned out to be{kappa} 0 [~] 0.7. This value, for the case of Spain, translates to a total lockdown with the exception of the mobility associated to essential services, a policy that was finally enforced on March 28.","Arenas, A.; Cota, W.; Gomez-Gardenes, J.; Gomez, S.; Granell, C.; Matamalas, J.

21178,Simulating the impact of different vaccination policies on the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City,"PurposeTo analyze potential COVID-19 epidemic outcomes in New York City under different SARS-CoV-2 virus circulation scenarios and vaccine rollout policies from early Jan 2021 to end of June 2021.

Key findingsIn anticipation of the potential arrival and dominance of the more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variant:

O_LIMass-vaccination would be critical to mitigating epidemic severity (26-52% reduction in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, compared to no vaccination, provided the new UK variant supplants currently circulating variants).
C_LIO_LIPrioritizing key risk groups for earlier vaccination would lead to greater reductions in hospitalizations and deaths than infections. Thus, in general this would be a good strategy.
C_LIO_LICurrent vaccination prioritization policy is suboptimal. To avert more hospitalizations and deaths, mass-vaccination of all individuals 65 years or older should be done as soon as possible. For groups listed in the same phase, 65+ year-olds should be given first priority ahead of others.
C_LIO_LIAvailable vaccine doses should be given to the next priority groups as soon as possible without awaiting hesitant up-stream groups.
C_LIO_LIWhile efficacy of vaccination off-protocol is unknown, provided immune response following a first vaccine dose persists, delaying the 2nd vaccine dose by [~]1 month (i.e. administer the two doses 8 weeks apart) can substantially reduce infections, hospitalizations, and deaths compared to the 3-week apart regimen. Across all scenarios tested here, delaying the 2nd vaccine dose leads to the largest reduction in severe epidemic outcomes (e.g. hospitalizations and deaths). Therefore, to protect as many people as possible, this strategy should be considered if rapid increases in infections, hospitalization or deaths and/or shortages in vaccines were to occur.

19615,Self-harm presentations to Emergency Departments and Place of Safety during the first wave of the UK COVID-19 pandemic: South London and Maudsley data on service use from February to June 2020.,"The lockdown and social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on both mental health service delivery, and the ways in which people are accessing these services. Previous reports from the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for around 1.2m residents in South London) have highlighted increased use of virtual contacts by mental health teams, with dropping numbers of face-to-face contacts over the first wave of the pandemic. There has been concern that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to higher mental health emergencies, particularly instances of self-harm. However, with people advised to stay at home during the  first wave lockdown, it is as yet unclear whether this impacted mental health service presentations. Taking advantage of SLaMs Clinical Records Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with daily updates of information from its electronic mental health records, this paper describes overall presentations to Emergency Department (ED) mental health liaison teams, and those with self-harm. The paper focussed on three periods: i) a pre-lockdown period 1st February to 15th March, ii) a lockdown period 16th March to 10th May and iii) a post-lockdown period 11th May to 28th June. In summary, all attendances to EDs for mental health support decreased during the lockdown period, including those with self-harm. All types of self-harm decreased during lockdown, with self-poisoning remaining the most common. Attendances to EDs for mental health support increased post-lockdown, although were only just approaching pre-lockdown levels by the end of June 2020.","Nuzum, E.; Martin, E.; Morgan, G.; Dutta, R.; Mueller, C.; Polling, C.; Pritchard, M.; Velupillai, S.; Stewart, R.",2020-12-14,Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology,10.1101/2020.12.10.20247155,1,Robert Stewart,King\'s College London,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.20247155v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.20247155v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

The system utilises Bayesian phylogenetics to capture evolutionary and infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. It identified the effectiveness of preventive measures in Canadas Atlantic bubble and mobile populations such as New York State. Its robustness extends to the prediction of cross-species disease transmission as we inferred SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to lions and tigers in New York Citys Bronx Zoo.

The program was administered as a research study ahead of clinical implementation, enabling us to launch surveillance testing while continuing to optimize the assay. Results of both the testing protocol itself and the study participants experience show how the program succeeded in providing routine, robust testing capable of contributing to outbreak prevention within a campus community and offer strategies for encouraging participation and a sense of civic responsibility.","Ehrenberg, A.

7191,A pitfall in estimating the effective reproductive number Rt for COVID-19,"The effective reproductive number Rt of COVID-19 is determined indirectly from data that are only incompletely known. Approaches based on reconstructing these data by sampling time lags from suitable distributions introduce noise effects that can result in distorted estimates of Rt. This, in turn, may lead to misleading interpretations of the efficacy of the various measures taken to limit COVID-19 transmission. We discuss in some detail a study used for real time monitoring of the reproductive number in Switzerland; see https://ncs-tf.ch/en/situation-report.

We argue that the method used to derive the above curve is systematically flawed and leads to an underestimation of the efficacy of the lockdown. The method adopted by the Robert Koch Institute suffers from similar deficiencies, their impact is however smaller.","Wyler, D.; Petermann, M.",2020-07-03,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.05.12.20099366,2,Daniel Wyler,University of Zurich,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20099366v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20099366v2.full.pdf,cc_by,10.4414/smw.2020.20307
2351,Evaluation of the secondary transmission pattern and epidemic prediction of COVID-19 in the four metropolitan areas of China,"Understanding the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 is crucial for evaluating its spread pattern, especially in metropolitan areas of China, as its spread can lead to secondary outbreaks outside Wuhan, the center of the new coronavirus disease outbreak. In addition, the experiences gained and lessons learned from China have the potential to provide evidence to support other metropolitan areas and large cities outside China with emerging cases. We used data reported from January 24, 2020, to February 23, 2020, to fit a model of infection, estimate the likely number of infections in four high-risk metropolitan areas based on the number of cases reported, and increase the understanding of the COVID-19 spread pattern. Considering the effect of the official quarantine regulations and travel restrictions for China, which began January 23[~]24, 2020, we used the daily travel intensity index from the Baidu Maps app to roughly simulate the level of restrictions and estimate the proportion of the quarantined population. A group of SEIR model statistical parameters were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and fitting on the basis of reported data. As a result, we estimated that the basic reproductive number, R0, was 2.91 in Beijing, 2.78 in Shanghai, 2.02 in Guangzhou, and 1.75 in Shenzhen based on the data from January 24, 2020, to February 23, 2020. In addition, we inferred the prediction results and compared the results of different levels of parameters. For example, in Beijing, the predicted peak number of cases was approximately 466 with a peak time of February 29, 2020; however, if the city were to implement different levels (strict, mild, or weak) of travel restrictions or regulation measures, the estimation results showed that the transmission dynamics would change and that the peak number of cases would differ by between 56% and [~]159%. We concluded that public health interventions would reduce the risk of the spread of COVID-19 and that more rigorous control and prevention measures would effectively contain its further spread but that the risk will increase when businesses and social activities return to normal before the end of the epidemic. Besides, the experiences gained and lessons learned from China are potential to provide evidences supporting for other metropolitan areas and big cities with emerging cases outside China.","Su, L.; Hong, N.; Zhou, X.; He, J.; Ma, Y.; Jiang, H.; Han, L.; Chang, F.; Shan, G.; Zhu, W.; Long, Y.",2020-04-15,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.03.06.20032177,3,Yun Long,Peking Union Medical College Hospital,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032177v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032177v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3389/fmed.2020.00171
5229,Role of the atmospheric pollution in the Covid-19 outbreak risk in Italy,"After the initial outbreak in China, the diffusion in Italy of SARS-CoV-2 is exhibiting a clear regional trend with Northern areas being the most affected in terms of both frequency and severity of cases. Among multiple factors possibly involved in such geographical differences, a role has been hypothesized for atmospheric pollution. We provide additional evidence on the possible influence of air quality, particularly in terms of chronicity of exposure on the spread viral infection in Italian regions. Actual data on COVID-19 outbreak in Italian provinces and corresponding long-term air quality evaluations, were obtained from Italian and European agencies, elaborated and tested for possible interactions. Our elaborations reveal that, beside concentrations, the chronicity of exposure may influence the anomalous variability of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. Data on distribution of atmospheric pollutants (NO2, O3, PM2.5 and PM10) in Italian regions during the last 4 years, days exceeding regulatory limits, and years of the last decade (2010-2019) in which the limits have been exceeded for at least 35 days, confirmed that Northern Italy has been constantly exposed to chronic air pollution. Long-term air-quality data significantly correlated with cases of Covid-19 in up to 71 Italian provinces (updated 27 April 2020) providing further evidence that chronic exposure to atmospheric contamination may represent a favourable context for the spread of the virus. Pro-inflammatory responses and high incidence of respiratory and cardiac affections are well known, while the capability of this coronavirus to bind particulate matters remains to be established. Atmospheric and environmental pollution should be considered as part of an integrated approach for sustainable development, human health protection and prevention of epidemic spreads but in a long-term and chronic perspective, since adoption of mitigation actions during a viral outbreak could be of limited utility.

22031,Outdoor transmission of COVID-19: Analysis of windspeed,"BackgroundTo examine whether outdoor exposures may contribute to the COVID-19 epidemic, we hypothesized that slower outdoor windspeed is associated with increased risk of transmission when individuals socialize outside.

MethodsDaily COVID-19 incidence reported between 3/16/2020-12/31/2020 was the outcome. Average windspeed and maximal daily temperature were derived from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Negative binomial regression was used to model incidence, adjusting for susceptible population size.

ResultsCases were very high in the initial wave but diminished quickly once lockdown procedures were enacted. Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted analyses revealed that warmer days with windspeed <5.5 MPH had increased COVID-19 incidence (aIRR=1.50, 95% C.I.=[1.25-1.81], P<0.001) as compared to days with average windspeed [&ge;]5.5 MPH.

ConclusionThis study suggests that outdoor transmission of COVID-19 may occur by noting that the risk of transmission of COVID-19 in the summer was highest on days when wind was reduced.","Clouston, S.; Morozova, O.; Meliker, J.",2021-02-08,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.02.05.21251179,1,Sean Clouston,Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.05.21251179v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.05.21251179v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA

Surveillance and short-term modeling forecasts are critical to provide timely information for decisions on control strategies. We use a model that explains the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic over time in the entire African continent, parameterized by socioeconomic and geoeconomic variations and the lagged effects of social policy and meteorological history. We observed the effect of the human development index, containment policies, testing capacity, specific humidity, temperature and landlocked status of countries on the local within-country and external between-country transmission. One week forecasts of case numbers from the model were driven by the quality of the reported data. Seeking equitable behavioral and social interventions, balanced with coordinated country-specific strategies in infection suppression, should be a continental priority to control the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa.","Ssentongo, P.; Fronterre, C.; Geronimo, A.; Greybush, S.

24885,The allometric propagation of COVID-19 is explained by human travel,"We analyzed the number of cumulative positive cases of COVID-19 as a function of time in countries around the World. We tracked the increase in cases from the onset of the pandemic in each region for up to 150 days. We found that in 81 out of 146 regions the trajectory was described with a power-law function for up to 30 days. We also detected scale-free properties in the majority of sub-regions in Australia, Canada, China, and the United States (US). We developed an allometric model that was capable of fitting the initial phase of the pandemic and was the best predictor for the propagation of the illness for up to 100 days. We then determined that the power-law COVID-19 exponent correlated with measurements of human mobility. The COVID-19 exponent correlated with the magnitude of air passengers per country. This correlation persisted when we analyzed the number of air passengers per US states, and even per US metropolitan areas. Furthermore, the COVID-19 exponent correlated with the number of vehicle miles travelled in the US. Together, air and vehicular travel explained 70 % of the variability of the COVID-19 exponent. Taken together, our results suggest that the scale-free propagation of the virus is present at multiple geographical scales and is correlated with human mobility. We conclude that models of disease transmission should integrate scale-free dynamics as part of the modeling strategy and not only as an emergent phenomenological property.","Tuladhar, R.; Grigolini, P.; Santamaria, F.",2021-04-23,Epidemiology,10.1101/2021.04.08.21255169,2,Fidel Santamaria,University of Texas at San Antonio,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.08.21255169v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.08.21255169v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
23754,Interim results of the safety and immune-efficacy of 1 versus 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 for cancer patients in the context of the UK vaccine priority guidelines,"BackgroundThe efficacy and safety profile of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have not been definitively established in immunocompromised patient populations. Patients with a known cancer diagnosis were hitherto excluded from trials of the vaccines currently in clinical use.

MethodsThis study presents data on the safety and immune efficacy of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine in 54 healthy controls and 151 mostly elderly patients with solid and haematological malignancies, respectively, and compares results for patients who were boosted with BNT162b2 at 3 weeks versus those who were not. Immune efficacy was measured as antibody seroconversion, T cell responses, and neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain and of a variant of concern (VOC) (B.1.1.7). We also collected safety data for the BNT162b2 vaccine up to 5 weeks following first dose.

FindingsThe vaccine was largely well tolerated. However, in contrast to its very high performance in healthy controls (>90% efficacious), immune efficacy of a single inoculum in solid cancer patients was strikingly low (below 40%) and very low in haematological cancer patients (below 15%). Of note, efficacy in solid cancer patients was greatly and rapidly increased by boosting at 21-days (95% within 2 weeks of boost). Too few haematological cancer patients were boosted for clear conclusions to be drawn.

ConclusionsDelayed boosting potentially leaves most solid and haematological cancer patients wholly or partially unprotected, with implications for their own health; their environment and the evolution of VOC strains. Prompt boosting of solid cancer patients quickly overcomes the poor efficacy of the primary inoculum in solid cancer patients.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSome cancer patients have been shown to exhibit sustained immune dysregulation, inefficient seroconversion and prolonged viral shedding as a consequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Consequently, their exclusion and, in particular, the exclusion of patients receiving systemic anti-cancer therapies, from the registry trials of the 5 approved COVID-19 vaccines raises questions about the efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in this patient population. In addition, whilst the change in the UKs dosing interval to 12-weeks aimed to maximise population coverage, it is unclear whether this strategy is appropriate for cancer patients and those on systemic anti-cancer therapies.

Added value of this studyWe report that the RNA-based SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine administered in cancer patients was well tolerated, and we provide first insights into both antibody and T cell responses to the vaccine in an immunocompromised patient population.

Implications of all the available evidenceIn cancer patients, one dose of 30ug of BNT162b2 yields poor vaccine efficacy, as measured by seroconversion rates, viral neutralisation capacity and T cell responses, at 3- and 5-weeks following the first inoculum. Patients with solid cancers exhibited a significantly greater response following a booster at 21-days. These data support prioritisation of cancer patients for an early (21-day) second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Given the globally poor responses to vaccination in patients with haematological cancers, post-vaccination serological testing, creation of herd immunity around these patients using a strategy of  ring vaccination, and careful follow-up should be prioritised.","Monin-Aldama, L.; Laing, A.

23152,Model-based estimation of transmissibility and reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 P.1 variant,"The variant of concern (VOC) P.1 emerged in the Amazonas state (Brazil) in November-2020. It contains a constellation of mutations, ten of them in the spike protein. Consequences of these specific mutations at the population level have been little studied so far, despite the detection of P.1 variant in 26 countries, with local transmission in at least four other countries in the Americas and Europe. Here, we estimate P.1s transmissibility and reinfection using a model-based approach, by fitting data from the Brazilian national health surveillance of hospitalized individuals and frequency of the P.1 variant in Manaus from December 2020 to February 2021, when the city was devastated by four times more cases than in the previous peak (April 2020). The new variant was found to be about 2.6 times more transmissible (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 2.4-2.8) than previous circulating variant(s). The city already had a high prevalence of individuals previously affected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (estimated as 78%, CI:73-83%), and the fitted model attributed 28% of the cases during the period to reinfections by the variant P.1. Our estimates rank P.1 as the most transmissible among the current identified SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, posing a serious threat and requiring urgent measures to control its global spread.","Coutinho, R.

17367,Corona-Independent Excess Mortality Due to Reduced Use of Emergency Medical Care in the Corona Pandemic: A Population-Based Observational Study,"BackgroundA significant decrease in the number of cases of emergency medical care during the first phase of the Corona pandemic has been reported from various regions of the world. Due to the lack of or delayed use of medical assistance, particularly in the case of time-critical clinical pictures (myocardial infarction, stroke), a corona collateral damage syndrome is postulated regarding possible health consequences. The present study investigates changes in the use of preclinical and clinical emergency care and effects on overall mortality in a rural area.

MethodsThe number of patients in the emergency department at the Klinikum Hochrhein and the ambulance service were retrospectively aggregated and analyzed regarding the total number and selected tracer diagnoses and alarm keywords. The investigation period was the 9th to 22nd calendar week 2020 compared to the identical period of the previous year. In addition, the death rates in the district were collected directly from the registries and related to the number of patients in emergency care.

ResultsOverall, the number of patients in clinical and preclinical emergency care declined significantly during the investigation period. This concerned in particular emergency inpatient treatment of patients with exacerbations or complications of severe chronic diseases. At the same time, excess mortality occurred in April 2020, which was still highly significant even after excluding deaths on or with COVID-19.

DiscussionOnly about 55 % of the excess mortality in April 2020 can be attributed to COVID-19 and is associated with the decline in inpatient emergency treatment, especially of chronically ill patients. Since a drift of patients with the use of other service providers is unlikely, we assume that fears of infection in overburdened hospitals, one-sided public communication and reporting, and the extent of contact restrictions have contributed significantly to the decline in case numbers and to excess mortality (collateral damage).

ConclusionFor similar situations in the future, it is strongly recommended to make crisis communication and media coverage more balanced so as not to prevent people with acute health problems from receiving medical assistance. Contact restrictions should be critically reviewed and limited to the objectively necessary minimum.","Kortuem, S.

20431,Do school closures and school reopenings affect community transmission of COVID-19? A systematic review of observational studies,"BackgroundSchool closures are associated with significant negative consequences and exacerbate inequalities. They were implemented worldwide to control SARS-CoV-2 in the first half of 2020, but their effectiveness, and the effects of lifting them, remain uncertain. This review summarises observational evidence of the effect of school closures and school reopenings on SARS-CoV-2 community transmission.

MethodsThe study protocol was registered on Prospero (ID:CRD42020213699). On 07 January 2021 we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, the WHO Global COVID-19 Research Database, ERIC, the British Education Index, the Australian Education Index, and Google. We included observational studies with quantitative estimates of the effect of school closures/reopenings on SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. We excluded prospective modelling studies and intra-school transmission studies. We performed a narrative synthesis due to data heterogeneity. We used the ROBINS-I tool to assess risk of bias.

FindingsWe identified 7,474 articles, of which 40 were included, with data from 150 countries. Of these 32 studies assessed school closures, and 11 examined reopenings. There was substantial heterogeneity between school closure studies, with half of the studies at lower risk of bias reporting reduced community transmission by up to 60%, and half reporting null findings. The majority (n=3 out of 4) of school reopening studies at lower risk of bias reported no associated increases in transmission.

ConclusionsSchool closure studies were at risk of confounding and collinearity from other non-pharmacological interventions implemented around the same time as school closures, and the effectiveness of closures remains uncertain. School reopenings, in areas of low transmission and with appropriate mitigation measures, were generally not accompanied by increasing community transmission. With such varied evidence on effectiveness, and the harmful effects, policymakers should take a measured approach before implementing school closures; and should look to reopen schools in times of low transmission, with appropriate mitigation measures.","Walsh, S.; Chowdhury, A.; Braithwaite, V.; Russell, S.; Birch, J.

24490,Estimating the strength of selection for new SARS-CoV-2 variants,"A challenge to controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is the ability of the virus to adapt to its new human hosts, with novel and more transmissible strains of the virus being continually identified. Yet there are no generally accepted methods to consistently estimate the relative magnitude of the change in transmissiblity of newly emerging variants. In this paper we consider three methods for examining and quantifying positive selection of new and emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2 over an existing wild-type strain. We consider replication at the level of countries and allow for the action of other processes that can change variants frequencies, specifically migration and drift. We apply these methods to the D614G spike mutation and the variant designated B.1.1.7, in every country where there is sufficient sequence data. For each of D614G and B.1.1.7, we find evidence for strong selection (greater than 25% increased contagiousness) in more than half of countries analyzed. Our results also shows that the selective advantages of these strains are highly heterogeneous at the country level, suggesting the need for a truly global perspective on the molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.","Van Dorp, C.

17956,Balancing quarantine and self-distancing measures in adaptive epidemic networks,"We study the relative importance of two key control measures for epidemic spreading: endogenous social self-distancing and exogenous imposed quarantine. We use the framework of adaptive networks, moment-closure, and ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to introduce several novel models based upon susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) dynamics. First, we compare computationally expensive, adaptive network simulations with their corresponding computationally highly efficient ODE equivalents and find excellent agreement. Second, we discover that there exists a relatively simple critical curve in parameter space for the epidemic threshold, which strongly suggests that there is a mutual compensation effect between the two mitigation strategies: as long as social distancing and quarantine measures are both sufficiently strong, large outbreaks are prevented. Third, we study the total number of infected and the maximum peak during large outbreaks using a combination of analytical estimates and numerical simulations. Also for large outbreaks we find a similar compensation effect as for the epidemic threshold. This suggests that if there is little incentive for social distancing within a population, drastic quarantining is required, and vice versa. Both pure scenarios are unrealistic in practice. Our models show that only a combination of measures is likely to succeed to control epidemic spreading. Fourth, we analytically compute an upper bound for the total number of infected on adaptive networks, using integral estimates in combination with the moment-closure approximation on the level of an observable. This is a methodological innovation. Our method allows us to elegantly and quickly check and cross-validate various conjectures about the relevance of different network control measures. In this sense it becomes possible to adapt models rapidly to new epidemic challenges such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic.","Horstmeyer, L.; Kuehn, C.; Thurner, S.",2020-11-10,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.11.07.20227595,1,Leonhard Horstmeyer,Complexity Science Hub Vienna,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.07.20227595v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.07.20227595v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
17081,"Cost and social distancing dynamics in a mathematical model of COVID-19 with application to Ontario, Canada","A mathematical model of COVID-19 is presented where the decision to increase or decrease social distancing is modelled dynamically as a function of the measured active and total cases as well as the perceived cost of isolating. Along with the cost of isolation, we define an overburden healthcare cost and a total cost. We explore these costs by adjusting parameters that could change with policy decisions. We observe that two disease prevention practices, namely increasing isolation activity and increasing incentive to isolate do not always lead to optimal health outcomes. We demonstrate that this is due to the fatigue and cost of isolation. We further demonstrate that an increase in the number of lock-downs, each of shorter duration can lead to minimal costs. Our results are compared to case data in Ontario, Canada from March to August 2020 and details of expanding the results to other regions are presented.

23278,A Rapid Method to Evaluate Pre-Travel Testing Programs for COVID-19: A Study in Hawaii,"BackgroundPre-travel testing programs are being implemented around the world to curb COVID-19 and its variants from incoming travelers. A common approach is a single pre-travel test, 72 hours before departure, such as in Hawaii; however this raises concerns for those who are incubating or those infected after pre-travel testing or during transit. We need a rapid method to assess the effectiveness of pre-travel testing programs, and we use Hawaii as our case study.

MethodsWe invited travelers departing from Kahului main airport at the end of their visit to Maui (major tourist destination among the Hawaiian islands) and performed COVID-19 PCR testing. Eligible participants needed a negative pre-travel test and a Hawaiian stay [&le;] 14 days. We designed for anonymous testing at the end of travel so that travel plans would be unaffected, and we aimed for [&ge;] 70% study participation.

ResultsAmong consecutive eligible travelers, 282 consented and 111 declined to participate, leading to a 72% (67-76%, 95% confidence interval) participation rate. Among 281 tested participants, two were positive with COVID-19, with an estimated positivity rate of 7 cases per 1,000 travelers. The top states of residence are California (58%) and Washington (21%). The mean length of stay was 7.7 {+/-} 0.2 days. Regarding pre-travel testing, 87% had non-nasopharyngeal tests and 66% had self-administered tests.

ConclusionsThis positivity rate leads to an estimated 17-30 infected travelers arriving daily to Maui in November-December 2020, and an estimated 52-70 infected travelers arriving daily to Hawaii during the same period. These counts surpass the Maui District Health Offices projected ability to accommodate 10 infected visitors daily in Maui; therefore, an additional mitigation layer for travelers is recommended. This rapid field study can be replicated widely in airports to assess effectiveness of pre-travel programs and can be expanded to evaluate COVID-19 importation and its variants.","Hou, A.

13490,"Effect of covid-19 lockdown on child protection medical assessments: a retrospective observational study in Birmingham, UK.","ObjectivesTo determine any change in referral patterns and outcomes in children (0-18) referred for child protection medical examination (CPME) during the covid-19 pandemic compared to previous years.

DesignRetrospective observational study, analysing routinely collected clinical data from CPME reports in a rapid response to the pandemic lockdown.

SettingBirmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust, which provides all routine CPME for Birmingham, England, population 1.1 million including 288,000 children.

ParticipantsChildren aged under 18 years attending CPME during an 18 week period from late February to late June during the years 2018, 2019, and 2020.

Main Outcome MeasuresNumbers of referrals, source of disclosure and outcomes from CPME

ResultsThere were 78 CPME referrals in 2018, 75 in 2019 and 47 in 2020, this was a 39.7% (95%CI 12.4-59.0) reduction in referrals from 2018 to 2020, and a 37.3% (95%CI 8.6-57.4) reduction from 2019 to 2020. There were fewer CPME referrals initiated by school staff in 2020, 12(26%) compared to 36 (47%) and 38 (52%) in 2018 and 2019 respectively. In all years 75.9% of children were known to social care prior to CPME, and 94% of CPME concluded that there were significant safeguarding concerns.

ConclusionsSchool closure due to covid-19 may have harmed children as child abuse has remained hidden. There needs to be either mandatory attendance at schools in future or viable alternatives found. There may be a significant increase in safeguarding referrals when schools fully re-open as children disclose the abuse they have experienced at home.

Article summary: Strengths and Limitations of the StudyO_LIThis is a highly robust study: we obtained CPME reports for 97% of CPME referrals during the study period.
C_LIO_LIWe ensured consistency of data extraction by double reviewing every report, with further consensus discussions for the few cases that raised uncertainties.
C_LIO_LIThe team extracting the data comprised highly experienced paediatricians with expertise in child abuse.
C_LIO_LIOne weakness is that we only considered minor injuries from outpatient CPME, excluding those admitted to hospital, so our findings do not include those with more serious NAI, however they would be taken to hospital for treatment due to the severity of their injuries.

24035,Impact of Clinical and Genomic Factors on SARS-CoV2 Disease Severity,"The SARS-CoV2 virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic is manifesting itself in different ways among infected people. While many are experiencing mild flue-like symptoms or are even remaining asymptomatic after infection, the virus has also led to serious complications, overloading ICUs while claiming more than 2.6 million lives world-wide. In this work, we apply AI methods to better understand factors that drive the severity of the disease. From the UK BioBank dataset we analyzed both clinical and genomic data of patients infected by this virus. Leveraging positive-unlabeled machine learning algorithms coupled with RubricOE, a state-of-the-art genomic analysis framework for genomic feature extraction, we propose severity prediction algorithms with high F1 score. Furthermore, we extracted insights on clinical and genomic factors driving the severity prediction. We also report on how these factors have evolved during the pandemic w.r.t. significant events such as the emergence of the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV2 virus strain.","Dey, S.; Bose, A.; Chakraborty, P.; Ghalwash, M.; Saenz, A.

2598,A high efficient hospital emergency responsive mode is the key of successful treatment of 100 COVID-19 patients in Zhuhai,"BackgroundSince December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. The mortality of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in severe and critical cases is very high. Facing this kind of public health emergency, high efficient administrative emergency responsive mode in designated hospital is needed.

MethodAs an affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, our hospital is the only designated one for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in Zhuhai, a medium-sized city. Novel coronavirus pneumonia department, which is administrative led by the president of hospital directly, has been established at early stage of epidemic crisis in my hospital. In NCP department, there are core members of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (PCCM) specialist and multidisciplinary team. Dont stick to national guidelines of NCP, based on professional opinion by respiratory professor and expert group, we focused on individualized treatment and timely adjustment of treatment and management strategies in working about COVID-19 patients.

Results1. High working efficiency: By Mar 02, 2020, we have completed 2974 citywide consultations and treatment of 366 inpatients, including 101 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. 2. Excellent therapeutic effect: Among 101 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, all were cured and discharged, except for one death. No secondary hospital infection, no pipeline infection and no pressure sore were found in all patients. 3. Finding and confirming person-to-person transmission characteristic of COVID-19 prior to official release conference: Strengthened protection is key point to zero infection in healthcare group and medical faculty and lower rate of second generation infectious patients. 4. Timely adjustment management and treatment strategy prior to guideline update: The first evidence of digestive tract involvement in COVID-19 has been found, and the earliest clinical trial of chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 has been carried out in our hospital.

ConclusionsIn our hospital, establishment of NCP department, which is administratively led by the president of hospital directly and specialized conduct by respiratory professor, is the key to success in management and treatment of COVID-19 patients. This hospital emergency responsive mode could provide reference for other hospitals and cities in epidemic situation.","Huang, J.; Li, Z.; Qu, X.; Zheng, X.; Tu, C.; Chen, M.; Tan, C.; Liu, J.; Shan, H.",2020-03-17,Health Systems And Quality Improvement,10.1101/2020.03.15.20034629,1,Jing Liu,Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yan-sen University,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20034629v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20034629v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
13240,Mass molecular testing for COVID19 using NGS-based technology and a highly scalable workflow,"Since first reported case of the new coronavirus infection in Wuhan, China, researchers and governments have witnessed an unseen rise in the number of cases. Thanks to the rapid work of Chinese scientists, the pathogen now called SARS-CoV-2 has been identified and its whole genome has been deposited in public databases by early January 2020. The availability of the genome has allowed researchers to develop Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assays, which are now the gold-standard for molecular diagnosis of the respiratory syndrome COVID19. Because of the rising number of cases and rapid spreading, the world has been facing a shortage of RT-PCR supplies, especially the ones involved in RNA extraction. This has been a major bottleneck to increase testing capacity in many countries that do not significantly manufacture these supplies (Brazil included). Additionally, RT-PCR scalability is highly dependent on equipment that usually perform testing of 96 samples at a time. In this work, we describe a cost-effective molecular NGS-based test for diagnosis of COVID19, which uses a single-step RNA extraction and presents high scalability and accuracy when compared to the gold-standard RT-PCR. A single run of the NGS-based test using the Illumina NextSeq 550 mid-end sequencing equipment is able to multiplex 1,536 patients samples, providing individual semi-qualitative results (detected, not detected). Detected results are provided with fragments per million (FPM) values, which was demonstrated to correlate with RT-PCR Cycle Threshold (CT) values. Besides, usage of the high-end Illumina Novaseq platform may yield diagnostic for up to 6,144 samples in a single run. Performance results when compared with RT-PCR show general accuracy of 96% (or 98% when only samples with CT values for gene N lower than 30 are considered). We have also developed an online platform, called VarsVID(R), a Varstation(R) feature, to help test executors to easily scale testing numbers. Sample registering, wet-lab worksheets, sample sheet for sequencing and results display are all features provided by VarsVID(R) on Varstation(R). Altogether, these results will contribute to control COVID19 pandemics.","Malta, F. D. M.; Amgarten, D. E.; Val, F. C.; Santana, R. A. F.; Cervato, M. C.; De Azevedo, B. M. C.; Basqueira, M. D.

To assess the effects of the pandemic, a team of researchers across a wide range of disciplines developed and implemented the Lifelines COVID-19 questionnaire, leading to the development of the Lifelines COVID-19 cohort. This cohort is recruited from participants of the Lifelines prospective population cohort and the Lifelines NEXT birth cohort, and participants were asked to fill out detailed questionnaires about their physical and mental health and experiences on a weekly basis starting in late March of 2020 and on a bi-weekly basis staring in June 2020. The Lifelines region covers the three Northern provinces of the Netherlands-- Drenthe, Groningen and Friesland--which together account for [~]10% of the Dutch population. To date, >70,000 people have responded to the questionnaires at least once, and the questionnaire program is still ongoing. Data collected by the questionnaires will be used to address four aspects of the outbreak: (1) how the COVID-19 pandemic developed in the three northern provinces of the Netherlands, (2) which environmental risk factors predict disease susceptibility and severity, (3) which genetic risk factors predict disease susceptibility and severity and (4) what are the psychological and societal impacts of the crisis.

9452,Hydroxychloroquine plus standard care compared with the standard care alone in COVID-19: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Background & ObjectiveThe efficacy and safety of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in treating coronavirus disease COVID-19 pandemic is disputed. This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of HCQ plus the standard of care in COVID-19 patients.

MethodsPubMed, The Cochrane Library, Embase, and web of sciences were searched up to June 1, 2020. The references list of the key studies was reviewed for additional relevant resources. Clinical studies registry databases were searched for identifying potential clinical trials. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaborations tool. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan software (version 5.3).

ResultsThree randomized controlled trials with total number of 242 patients were identified eligible for meta-analysis. No significant differences were observed between HCQ and standard care in terms of viral clearance (Risk ratio [RR] = 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.91, 1.16; P = 0.68), disease progression (RR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.10, 0.81; P = 0.94), Chest CT (RR = 1.40; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.91; P = 0.03). There is a significant difference between HCQ and standard care for adverse events (RR = 2.88; 95% CI = 1.50, 5.54; P = 0.002).

ConclusionAlthough the current meta-analysis failed to confirm the efficacy and safety of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, further rigorous randomized clinical trials are necessary to evaluate conclusively the efficacy and safety of HCQ against COVID-19.","Amani, B.; Khanijahani, A.; Amani, B.",2020-06-12,Respiratory Medicine,10.1101/2020.06.05.20122705,1,Behnam Amani,Tehran University of Medical Sciences,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.05.20122705v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.05.20122705v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
4734,Antibody testing for COVID-19: A report from the National COVID Scientific Advisory Panel,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic caused >1 million infections during January-March 2020. There is an urgent need for reliable antibody detection approaches to support diagnosis, vaccine development, safe release of individuals from quarantine, and population lock-down exit strategies. We set out to evaluate the performance of ELISA and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) devices.

MethodsWe tested plasma for COVID (SARS-CoV-2) IgM and IgG antibodies by ELISA and using nine different LFIA devices. We used a panel of plasma samples from individuals who have had confirmed COVID infection based on a PCR result (n=40), and pre-pandemic negative control samples banked in the UK prior to December-2019 (n=142).

ResultsELISA detected IgM or IgG in 34/40 individuals with a confirmed history of COVID infection (sensitivity 85%, 95%CI 70-94%), vs. 0/50 pre-pandemic controls (specificity 100% [95%CI 93-100%]). IgG levels were detected in 31/31 COVID-positive individuals tested [&ge;]10 days after symptom onset (sensitivity 100%, 95%CI 89-100%). IgG titres rose during the 3 weeks post symptom onset and began to fall by 8 weeks, but remained above the detection threshold. Point estimates for the sensitivity of LFIA devices ranged from 55-70% versus RT-PCR and 65-85% versus ELISA, with specificity 95-100% and 93-100% respectively. Within the limits of the study size, the performance of most LFIA devices was similar.

ConclusionsCurrently available commercial LFIA devices do not perform sufficiently well for individual patient applications. However, ELISA can be calibrated to be specific for detecting and quantifying SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG and is highly sensitive for IgG from 10 days following first symptoms.","Adams, E.

17977,Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Cardiac Rehabilitation Delivery around the World,"BackgroundTo investigate impacts of COVID-19 on CR delivery around the globe, including effects on providers and patients.

MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, a piloted survey was administered to CR programs globally via REDCap from April-June/2020. The 50 members of the ICCPR and personal contacts facilitated program identification.

ResultsOverall, 1062(18.3% program response rate) responses were received from 70/111(63.1% country response rate) countries in the world with existent CR programs. Of these, 367(49.1%) programs reported they had stopped CR delivery, and 203(27.1%) stopped temporarily (mean=8.3{+/-}2.8weeks). Alternative models were delivered in 322(39.7%) programs, primarily through low-tech modes (n=226,19.3%). 353(30.2%) respondents were re-deployed, and 276 (37.3%) felt the need to work due to fear of losing their job, despite the perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 (mean=30.0%{+/-}27.4/100). 266(22.5%) reported anxiety, 241(20.4%) were concerned about exposing their family, 113(9.7%) reported increased workload to transition to remote delivery, and 105(9.0%) were juggling caregiving responsibilities during business hours. Patients were often contacting staff regarding grocery shopping for heart-healthy foods (n=333,28.4%), how to use technology to interact with the program (n=329,27.9%), having to stop their exercise because they have no place to exercise (n=303,25.7%), and their risk of death from COVID-19 due to pre-existing cardiovascular disease (n=249,21.2%). Respondents perceived staff (n=488,41.3%) and patient (n=453,38.6%) personal protective equipment, as well as COVID-19 screening (n=414,35.2%) and testing (n=411,35.0%) as paramount to in-person service resumption.

ConclusionApproximately 4400 programs ceased service delivery. Those that remain open are implementing new technologies to ensure their patients receive CR safely, despite the challenges.

Highlights- COVID-19 has impacted cardiac rehabilitation (CR) delivery around the globe.
- In this cross-sectional study, a survey was completed by 1062 (18.3%) CR programs from 70 (63.1%) countries.
- The pandemic has resulted in cessation of [~]75% of CR programs, with others ceasing initiation of new patients, reducing components delivered, and/or changing of mode delivery with little opportunity for planning and training.
- There is also significant psychosocial and economic impact on CR providers.
- Alternative CR model (e.g. home-based, virtual) reimbursement advocacy is needed, to ensure safe, accessible secondary prevention delivery.","Ghisi, G. L. D.

23402,Point-of-care ultrasonography for risk stratification of non-critical suspected COVID-19 patients on admission (POCUSCO): a prospective binational study,"BackgroundLung point-of-care ultrasonography (L-POCUS) is highly effective in detecting pulmonary peripheral patterns and may allow early identification of patients who are likely to develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We hypothesized that L-POCUS performed during the initial examination would identify non-severe COVID-19 patients with a high risk of getting worse.

MethodsPOCUSCO was a prospective, multicenter study. Non-critical adult patients who were admitted to the emergency department (ED) for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were included and had L-POCUS performed within 48 hours following admission. The severity of lung damage was assessed using the L-POCUS score based on 36 points for ARDS. The primary outcome was the rate of patients requiring intubation or who died within 14 days following inclusion.

ResultsAmong 296 participating patients, 8 (2.7%) had primary outcome. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic of L-POCUS was 0.80 [95%CI:0.60-0.94]. The score values which achieved a sensibility > 95% in defining low-risk patients and a specificity > 95% in defining high-risk patients were <1 and [&ge;]16, respectively. The rate of patients with an unfavorable outcome was 0/95 (0%[95%CI:0-3.9]) for low-risk patients (score=0) versus 4/184 (2.17%[95%CI:0.8-5.5]) for intermediate-risk patients (score 1-15) and 4/17 (23.5%[95%CI:11.4-42.4]) for high-risk patients (score [&ge;]16). In patients with confirmed COVID-19 (n=58), the AUC of L-POCUS was 0.97 [95%CI:0.92-1.00].

ConclusionsL-POCUS allows risk-stratification of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. These results should be confirmed in a population with a higher risk of an unfavorable outcome.

16959,On nonlinear incidence rate of Covid-19,"Classical Susceptible-Infected-Removed model with constant transmission rate and removal rate may not capture real world dynamics of epidemic due to complex influence of multiple external factors on the spread. On top of that transmission rate may vary widely in a large region due to non-stationarity of spatial features which poses difficulty in creating a global model. We modified discrete global Susceptible-Infected-Removed model by using time varying transmission rate, recovery rate and multiple spatially local models. No specific functional form of transmission rate has been assumed. We have derived the criteria for disease-free equilibrium within a specific time period. A single Convolutional LSTM model is created and trained to map multiple spatiotemporal features to transmission rate. The model achieved 8.39% mean absolute percent error in terms of cumulative infection cases in each locality in a 10-day prediction period. Local interpretations of the model using perturbation method reveals local influence of different features on transmission rate which in turn is used to generate a set of generalized global interpretations. A what-if scenario with modified recovery rate illustrates rapid dampening of the spread when forecasted with the trained model. A comparative study with current normal scenario reveals key necessary steps to reach baseline.","Paul, S.

24611,Reliable assessment of in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by a Rapid Antigen Detection Test,"The identification and isolation of highly infectious SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals is an important public health strategy. Rapid antigen detection tests (RADT) are promising candidates for large-scale screenings due to timely results and feasibility for on-site testing. Nonetheless, the diagnostic performance of RADT in detecting infectious individuals is yet to be fully determined. Two combined oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from individuals at a routine SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic center. Side-by-side evaluations of RT-qPCR and RADT as well as live virus cultures of positive samples were performed to determine the sensitivity of the Standard Q COVID-19 Ag Test (SD Biosensor/Roche) in detecting SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with cultivable virus. A total of 2,028 samples were tested and 118 virus cultures inoculated. SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in 210 samples by RT-qPCR, representing a positive rate of 10.36%. The Standard Q COVID-19 Ag Test yielded a positive result in 92 (4.54%) samples resulting in an overall sensitivity and specificity of 42.86% and 99.89%. For adjusted Ct values <20, <25, and <30 the RADT reached sensitivities of 100%, 98.15%, and 88.64%, respectively. All 29 culture positive samples were detected by RADT. While overall sensitivity was low, Standard Q COVID-19 RADT reliably detected patients with high RNA loads. Additionally, negative RADT results fully corresponded with the lack of viral cultivability in Vero E6 cells. These results indicate that RADT can be a valuable tool for the detection of individuals that are likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2. RADT testing could therefore guide public health testing strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

5536,Real-time time-series modelling for prediction of COVID-19 spread and intervention assessment,"Substantial amount of data about the COVID-19 pandemic is generated every day. Yet, data streaming, while considerably visualized, is not accompanied with advanced modelling techniques to provide real-time insights. This study introduces a unified platform which integrates visualization capabilities with advanced statistical methods for predicting the virus spread in the short run, using real-time data. The platform is backed up by advanced time series models to capture any possible non-linearity in the data which is enhanced by the capability of measuring the expected impact of preventive interventions such as social distancing and lockdowns. The platform enables lay users, and experts, to examine the data and develop several customized models with different restriction such as models developed for specific time window of the data. Our policy assessment of the case of Australia, shows that social distancing and travel ban restriction significantly affect the reduction of number of cases, as an effective policy.","Hossein Rashidi, T.; Shahriari, S.; Azad, A.; Vafaee, F.",2020-04-29,Health Policy,10.1101/2020.04.24.20078923,1,Fatemeh Vafaee,UNSW Sydney,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.24.20078923v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.24.20078923v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
9835,Predictive accuracy of a hierarchical logistic model of cumulative SARS-CoV-2 case growth,"BackgroundInfectious disease predictions models, including virtually all epidemiological models describing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic up to June 2020, are rarely evaluated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the predictive accuracy of a prognostic model for forecasting the development of the cumulative number of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases in countries and administrative regions worldwide.

MethodsThe cumulative number of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases was forecasted in 251 regions with a horizon of two weeks, one month, and two months using a previously described hierarchical logistic model at the end of March 2020. Forecasts were compared to actual observations by using a series of evaluation metrics.

ResultsOn average, predictive accuracy was very high in nearly all regions at the two weeks forecast, high in most regions at the one month forecast, and notable in the majority of the regions at the two months forecast. Higher accuracy was associated with the availability of more data for estimation and with a more pronounced cumulative case growth from the first case to the date of estimation. In some strongly affected regions, cumulative case counts were considerably underestimated.

ConclusionsWith keeping its limitations in mind, the investigated model can be used for the preparation and distribution of resources during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Future research should primarily address the models assumptions and its scope of applicability. In addition, establishing a relationship with known mechanisms and traditional epidemiological models of disease transmission would be desirable.","Kriston, L.",2020-06-16,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.06.15.20130989,1,Levente Kriston,University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.20130989v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.20130989v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.1186/s12874-020-01160-2
11692,Direct-to-Consumer Chat-Based Remote Care Before and During the COVID-19 Outbreak,"ObjectiveTo compare the patient population, common complaints, and physician recommendations in direct-to-consumer chat-based consults, before and during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Data sourcesData on patient characteristics, patient complaints, and physician recommendations from 36,864 chat-based telemedicine consults with physicians in an online-clinic by patients from across the United States between April 2019 and April 2020.

Study DesignWe perform a retrospective analysis comparing patient characteristics, visit characteristics, and physician recommendation before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. We examine patient age and gender, visit time, patient chief complains, and physician medical recommendation (including prescription drugs, reassurance, and referrals).

Principal FindingsBefore March 2020, most patients were female (75 percent) and 18-44 years old (89 percent). Common complaints such as abdominal pain, dysuria, or sore throat suggested minor acute conditions. Most cases (67 percent) were resolved remotely, mainly via prescriptions; a minority were referred. Since March 2020, the COVID-19 emergency has led to a sharp (fourfold) increase in case volume, including more males (from 25 to 29 percent), patients aged 45 and older (from 11 to 17 percent), and more cases involving mental health complaints and complaints related to COVID-19. Across all symptoms, significantly more cases (78 percent) have been resolved remotely.

ConclusionsThe COVID-19 outbreak in the United States has been associated with a sharp increase in the use of chat-based telemedicine services, including by new patient demographics, an increase in both COVID-19 and mental health complains, and an increase in remote case resolutions.","Zeltzer, D.; Vodonos Zilberg, A.; Paz, Y.

1695,The lockdown of Hubei Province causing different transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan and Beijing,"BackgroundAfter the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) starting in late 2019, a number of researchers have reported the predicted the virus transmission dynamics. However, under the strict control policy the novel coronavirus does not spread naturally outside Hubei Province, and none of the prediction closes to the real situation.

Methods and findingsWe used the traditional SEIR model, fully estimated the effect of control measures, to predict the virus transmission in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, and Beijing. We forecast that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV would reach its peak around March 6{+/-}10 in Wuhan and March 20{+/-}16 in Beijing, respectively. The infectious population in Beijing would be much less (only 0.3%) than those in Wuhan at the peak of this transmission wave. The number of confirmed cases in cities inside Hubei Province grow exponentially, whereas those in cities outside the province increase linearly.

ConclusionsThe unprecedented province lockdown substantially suspends the national and global outbreak of 2019-nCoV.","Li, X.; Zhao, X.; Sun, Y.",2020-02-17,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.02.09.20021477,2,Xinhai Li,"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021477v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021477v2.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
19659,Maintenance therapy with infliximab or vedolizumab in inflammatory bowel disease is not associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence: UK experience in the 2020 pandemic,"BackgroundThere has been great concern amongst clinicians and patients that immunomodulatory treatments for IBD may increase risk of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or progression to severe disease.

MethodsSera from 640 patients attending for maintenance infliximab or vedolizumab infusions between April and June 2020 at the John Radcliffe Hospital (Oxford, UK) and Royal London Hospital (London, UK) were tested using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Demographic and clinical data were collated from electronic patient records and research databases.

ResultsSeropositivity rates of 3.0% (12/404), 7.2% (13/180), and 12.5% (7/56) were found in the Oxford and London adult IBD cohorts and London paediatric IBD cohorts respectively. Seroprevalence rates in the Oxford adult IBD cohort were lower than that seen in non-patient facing health-care workers within the same hospital (7.2%). Seroprevalence rates of the London paediatric IBD cohort were comparable to a contemporary healthy cohort collected at the same hospital (54/396, 13.6%).

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 seropositivity rates are not elevated in patients with IBD receiving maintenance infliximab or vedolizumab infusions. There is no rationale based on these data for elective interruption of maintenance therapy, and we recommend continuation of maintenance therapy. These data do not address the efficacy of vaccination in these patients.","Mcgregor, C. G.; Adams, A.; Sadler, R.; Arancibia-Carcamo, C.

6948,Increased levels of anxiety among medical and non-medical university students during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Arab Emirates.,"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase anxiety levels within the community and in particular medical students who are already considered psychologically vulnerable groups. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, no study has yet estimated the effect of this pandemic on university students in the UAE or its impact on the psychological well-being of medical students.

MethodsIn this study, we surveyed 1485 medical (comprising medical and dental) and non-medical university students across 4 emirates within the UAE. We used an online platform to assess knowledge, sources of information, changes in hygienic behavior, perceptions of fear and worry and anxiety levels using the generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale. The GAD-7 score was measured at three time points; during hospital visits for medical/dental students, before the introduction of online learning and after online learning for all students.

ResultsThe majority of students demonstrated high levels of knowledge and utilized reliable sources of information. Non-medical students exercised higher compliance with social restrictions, while medical students practiced better hand hygiene. Almost half of students reported anxiety levels ranging from mild to severe with females reporting higher anxiety scores during hospital visits (OR=2.02, 95% CI, 1.41 to 2.91) and medical students reporting lower anxiety levels in comparison to dental students (OR=0.61, 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.84). Medical students reported higher levels of anxiety during their clinical rotations which decreased with the introduction of online learning, yet, non-medical students anxiety levels increased with online learning.

ConclusionsThis is the first study to provide important information on the initial response and anxiety levels in university students across the UAE. The findings from our study can be used to support the development of effective screening strategies and interventions to build psychological resilience among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health emergencies in the future.","Saddik, B.; Hussein, A.; Sharif-Askari, F.

17531,Association between anti-interferon-alpha autoantibodies and COVID-19 in systemic lupus erythematosus,"ObjectivesAnti-type I interferon (IFN) autoantibodies have been reported in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Recently, an association of these autoantibodies with severe COVID-19 was reported in the general population. We assessed whether having pre-existing anti-IFN autoantibodies was associated with COVID-19 infection in SLE patients.

MethodsPatients with SLE who developed COVID-19 between April 1st to October 1st, 2020 were studied. Biobanked pre-COVID-19 plasma from these SLE subjects and healthy controls were tested for anti-IFN IgG autoantibodies by ELISA. The ability of plasma anti-IFN autoantibodies to block signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation by recombinant human IFN in vitro was assessed by flow cytometry.

ResultsTen SLE subjects with COVID-19 were identified. A 40% of these subjects had stable autoantibodies against IFN for up to three years preceding COVID-19 diagnosis. A 50% of the subjects with these autoantibodies neutralized IFN induced STAT1 phosphorylation.None of the other SLE samples blocked IFN signaling.

ConclusionsWe noted an increased prevalence of pre-existing anti-IFN autoantibodies in SLE patients with COVID-19 compared to the reported prevalence in lupus patients and the general population with severe COVID-19. Autoantibodies against IFN in SLE patients may be pathogenic and patients with them maybe at-risk of developing COVID-19.

Key MessagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about this subject?C_ST_ABS- Anti-type I interferon (IFN) autoantibodies have been reported in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and have recently been associated with severe COVID-19 in the general population.


What does this study add?- SLE subjects with COVID-19 had an increased prevalence of pre-existing anti-IFN autoantibodies compared to the reported prevalence in lupus patients and the general population with severe COVID-19.
- Plasma from 50% of subjects with these autoantibodies were able to block in vitro activity of IFN.
- SLE patients with pre-existing anti-IFN autoantibodies had more severe COVID-19 manifestations.


How might this impact on clinical practice or future developments?- Anti-IFN autoantibodies may be pathogenic and could prove to be a helpful prognostic marker to predict which SLE patient may develop COVID-19 and inform preventive measures and management of this subset of patients.","Gupta, S.; Nakabo, S.; Chu, J.; Hasni, S.; Kaplan, M.",2020-11-03,Rheumatology,10.1101/2020.10.29.20222000,1,Sarthak Gupta,National Institutes of Health,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.29.20222000v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.29.20222000v1.full.pdf,cc0,NA
16963,"PREVALENCE OF ANTIBODIES AGAINST SARS-CoV-2 IN PROFESSIONALS OF A PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY AT SAO PAULO, SP, BRAZIL","BackgroundCovid-19 Serology may document exposure and perhaps protection to the virus and serological test may help understand epidemic dynamics. We tested health workers form a public laboratory to evaluate previous exposure to the virus and estimate the prevalence of antibodies against-SARS-CoV-2 in Adolfo Lutz Institute, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil.

MethodsThis study was an open, prospective evaluation among professionals of Adolfo Lutz Institute some administrative personnel from the Secretary of Health that shares common areas with the institute. We used a lateral flow immunoassay (rapid test) to detect IgG and IgM for SARS-CoV-2; positive samples were further evaluated using Roche Electrochemiluminescence assay. SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was also offered to participants.

ResultsA total of 406 HPs participated. Thirty five (8.6%) tested positive on rapid test and 32 these rapid test seropositive cases were confirmed by ECLIA. 43 HPs had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected at a median of 33 days, and the three cases not reactive at Roche ECLIA had a previous positive RNA. Outsourced professionals (34% seropositive), males (15%) workers referring COVID-19 patients at home (22%) and those living farther form the institute tended to have higher prevalence of seropositivity, but in multivariable logistic analysis only outsourced workers and those with COVID patients at home remained independently associated to seropositivity. We observed no relation of seropositivity to COVID samples handling. Presence of at least one symptom was common but some clinical manifestations as anosmia/dysgeusia. Fatigue, cough and fever were associated to seropositivity.

ConclusionsWe documented a relatively high (8.6%) of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological reactivity in this population, higher among outsourced workers and those residing with COVID-19 patients. COVID related work did not increased seropositivity. Some symptoms show strong association to COVID-19 serology and may be used in scoring tools for screening or diagnosis in resort limited settings.","Silva, V. O.; De Oliveira, E. L.; Castejon, M.

20474,Different selection dynamics of S and RdRp between SARS-CoV-2 genomes with and without the dominant mutations,"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic that has affected millions of people worldwide, with no dedicated treatment or vaccine currently available. As pharmaceutical research against and the most frequently used tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection both depend on the genomic and peptide sequences of the virus for their efficacy, understanding the mutation rates and content of the virus is critical. Two key proteins for SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication are the S protein, responsible for viral entry into the cells, and RdRp, the RNA polymerase responsible for replicating the viral genome. Due to their roles in the viral cycle, these proteins are crucial for the fitness and infectiousness of the virus. Our previous findings had shown that the two most frequently observed mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, 14408C>T in the RdRp coding region, and 23403A>G in the S gene, are correlated with higher mutation density over time. In this study, we further detail the selection dynamics and the mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2 genes, comparing them between isolates carrying both mutations, and isolates carrying neither. We find that the S gene and the RdRp coding region show the highest variance between the genotypes, and their selection dynamics contrast each other over time. The S gene displays higher positive selection in mutant isolates early on, and undergoes increasing negative selection over time, whereas the RdRp region in the mutant isolates shows strong negative selection throughout the pandemic.","Kochan, N.; Eskier, D.; Suner, A.; Karakülah, G.; Oktay, Y.",2021-01-05,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2021.01.03.20237602,1,Yavuz Oktay,Izmir Biomedicine and Genome Center (IBG),https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.03.20237602v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.03.20237602v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1016/j.meegid.2021.104796
17628,MODELLING PRESYMPTOMATIC INFECTIOUSNESS IN COVID-19,"This paper considers SEPIR, the extension of an existing parametric SEIR continuous simulation compartment model. Both models can be fitted to real data as they include parameters that can simply be estimated from the data. However SEPIR deploys an additional presymptomatic (also called asymptomatic) infectious stage that is not included in SEIR but which is known to exist in COVID-19. This stage is also parametrised and so can be fitted to data. Both SEPIR and the existing SEIR model assume a homogeneous mixing population, an idealisation that is unrealistic in practice when dynamically varying control strategies are deployed against virus. This means that if either model is to represent more than just a single period in the behaviour of the epidemic, then the parameters of the model will have to be time dependent. This issue is also discussed in this paper.","Cheng, R.; Dye, C.; Dagpunar, J.; Williams, B.",2020-11-04,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.11.01.20224014,1,Russell Cheng,University of Southampton,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.01.20224014v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.01.20224014v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
24012,Mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic: findings from the CLINIMEX exercise cohort in the year of 2020,"Background and ObjectiveThe COVID-19 pandemic has heavily hit Brazil and, in particular, our Clinics current location in Copacabana - Rio de Janeiro city, where, as of mid-February 2021, it led to one death per 266 inhabitants. After having recently updated the vital status and mortality data in our exercise population (CLINIMEX exercise cohort), we hypothesized that the review of their evaluation reports would offer a unique opportunity to unearth some relevant information about the association between selected variables assessed in our comprehensive Exercise Medicine evaluation protocol, in particular, aerobic and musculoskeletal (MUSK) fitness, clinical variables, and death due to COVID-19.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective study using data from the CLINIMEX exercise cohort that included 6,101 non-athletic men and women aged >30 years who were alive as of March 12th, 2020, and whos vital status was followed up to December 14th, 2020. For data analysis, two approaches were used: 1) comparison of frequency of deaths and relative % of underlying causes of death between the last 18-months pre-pandemic and 9-month pandemic periods; and 2) data from 51 variables from the participants most recent evaluation, including sex, age and clinical profile plus other variables obtained from physical examination, spirometry, (MUSK) fitness (e.g., sitting-rising test) and maximal cycling leg cardiopulmonary exercise testing (e.g. maximal VO2 and cardiorespiratory optimal point) were selected for comparison between groups of non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 deaths. Results: Age at death varied from 51 to 102 years [mean = 80 years]. Only 4 participants that died - 3 COVID-19 and 1 non-COVID-19 - were healthy at the time of their evaluation [p=.52]. COVID-19 was the most frequent (n=35; 36.5%) cause of death among the 96 deaths during this 9-month period. Comparing pre-pandemic and pandemic periods, there was a 35% increase in deaths and proportionately fewer deaths due to neoplasia and other causes other than cardiovascular or endocrine diseases. Results of aerobic and MUSK fitness tests indicated that the majority of the study participants were relatively unfit when compared to available age and sex-reference values. Indeed, there were few differences in the 51 selected variables between the two groups, suggesting a somewhat healthier profile among COVID-19 death participants: lower body mass index [p=.04], higher % of predicted forced vital capacity [p=.04], lower number of previous percutaneous coronary interventions [p=.04] and lower resting supine diastolic blood pressure [p=.03], with no differences for aerobic/MUSK fitness variables or past history of exercise/sports [p>.05].

ConclusionOur data support that COVID-19 was a frequent and premature cause of death in a convenience sample of primarily white, unhealthy, middle-age and elderly individuals and that data from exercise/sport history and physical fitness testing obtained some years earlier were unable to distinguish non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 deaths.","Araujo, C.

17463,"Features of α-Hydroxybutyrate Dehydrogenase during various specific periods in COVID-19 patients within Xiangyang, China: a cohort study","BackgroundCoronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has spread all over the world and brought extremely huge losses. There is no study to systematically analyse the features of hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (-HBDH) in COVID-19 patients during the periods before and after illness progression, before death and course from exposure onset.

MethodsWe collected all included patients general information, clinical type, -HBDH value and outcome, and analyzed -HBDH values within different initial time and different periods.

ResultsIn the first 30 days after symptom onset, the -HBDH median value was 156.33 U/L. The first test of -HBDH since exposure onset appeared on the 8th day, it increased from the 8th day to 18th day and decreased after the 18th day. -HBDH median value showed a slight change until it started to increase 1 day before transforming to severe type, while it continued to increase during 4 days before and after transforming to critical type. The -HBDH median value ranged from 191.11 U/L to 455.11U/L before death.

Conclusions-HBDH value increases in some COVID-19 patients, obviously in severe type, critical type and death patients, and mainly in 18 days after exposure onset and 10 days after symptom onset. -HBDH increases 1 day before transforming to severe type, continues to increase in critical type and death patients, increases rapidly 5 days before death. The increase of -HBDH suggests that COVID-19 patients have tissues and organs damage, mainly in heart. In brief, -HBDH is an important indicator to judge the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.","Zhu, H.; Qu, G.; Yu, H.; Huang, G.; Chen, L.; Zhang, M.; Wan, S.; Pei, B.",2020-11-01,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.10.28.20221127,1,Bin Pei,"Center of Evidence-Based Medicine, Xiangyang No.1 People\'s Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine, Xiangyang, 441000, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.28.20221127v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.28.20221127v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
9511,"Private Health Sector in India: Ready and willing, yet underutilized in the Covid-19 pandemic.","BackgroundThe private medical sector is a resource that must be estimated for efficient inclusion into public healthcare during pandemics.

MethodsA survey was conducted among private healthcare workers to ascertain their views on the potential resources that can be accessed from the private sector and methods to do the same.

ResultsThere were 213 respondents, 80% of them being doctors. Nearly half (47.4%) felt that the contribution from the private medical sector has been suboptimal. Areas suggested for improved contributions by the private sector related to patient care (71.8%) and provision of equipment (62.4%), with fewer expectations (39.9%) on the research front. Another area of deemed support was maintaining continuity of care for non-COVID patients using virtual consultation services (77.4%), tele-consultation being the preferred option (60%). 58.2% felt that the Government had not involved the private sector adequately; and 45.1% felt they should be part of policy-making.

ConclusionA streamlined pathway to facilitate the private sector to join hands with the public sector for a national cause is the need of the hour. Through our study, we have identified gaps in the current contribution by the private sector and identified areas in which they could contribute, by their own admission.","Davalbhakta, S.; Sharma, S.; Gupta, S.; Agarwal, V.; Pandey, G.; Misra, D.

6754,"Chaos, Percolation and the Coronavirus Spread: a two-step model.","We discuss a two-step model for the rise and decay of a new coronavirus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV-2) first reported in December 2019, COVID-19. The first stage is well described by the same equation for turbulent flows, population growth and chaotic maps: a small number of infected d0 grows exponentially to a saturation value d{infty}. The typical growth {lambda} time (aggressive spreading of the virus) is given by [Formula], where{lambda} is the Lyapunov exponent.!After a time tcrit determined by social distancing and/or other measures, the spread decreases exponentially as for nuclear decays and non-chaotic maps. Some countries, like China, S. Korea and Italy are in this second stage while others including the USA are near the end of the growth stage. The model predicts 15,000 ({+/-}2,250) casualties for the Lombardy region (Italy) at the end of the spreading around May 10,2020. Without the quarantine, the casualties would have been more than 50,000, hundred days after the start of the pandemic. The data from the 50 US states are of very poor quality because of an extremely late and confused response to the pandemic, resulting unfortunately in a large number of casualties, more than 70,000 on May 6, 2020.

13426,Comprehensive Systematic Review to Identify putative COVID-19 Treatments: Roles for Immunomodulator and Antiviral Treatments,"ObjectivesTo identify putative COVID-19 treatments and identify the roles of immunomodulators and antivirals in disease management.

DesignSystematic review.

Data sourcesPubMed, bioRxiv.org and medRxiv.org were searched for studies suggestive of effective treatments for COVID-19. Additional studies were identified via a snowballing method applied to the references of retrieved papers as well as a subsequent targeted search for drug names.

Review methodsInclusion criteria included any case series or randomised control trials in any language that were published from 18th December 2019 to 18th April 2020 and described COVID-19 treatment. Of an initial 2140 studies identified from the initial search, 29 studies were found to meet the inclusion criteria and included in this comprehensive systematic review.

Results19 studies of antiviral treatments for COVID-19 have been reported and seven studies for immunomodulatory treatments. Six randomised controlled trials have been published with one positive trial for Hydroxychloroquine. This small study consisted of 31 patients though subsequent studies showed contradictory findings. All the remaining studies were observational studies, retrospective case reviews or non-randomised trials and these results are difficult to interpret due to methodological issues.

ConclusionsTo date, an impressive number of studies have been performed in a short space of time, indicative of a resilient clinical trials infrastructure. However, there is a lack of high quality evidence to support any novel treatments for COVID-19 to be incorporated into the current standard of care. The majority of the studies of treatments for COVID-19 could only be found in pre-print servers. Future clinical reviews should therefore be Comprehensive Systematic Reviews involving pre-print studies to prevent potential unnecessary replications of clinical studies.","Hill, T.; Baker, M.; Isherwood, L.; Lee, L.

19692,Foistar(Camostat mesylate) associated with the significant decrease in CRP levels compared to Kaletra(Lopinavir/Ritonavir) treatment in Korean mild COVID-19 pneumonic patients.,"BackgroundThere is limited information due to absence of virus titer and symptom related changes. Nonetheless, this is the first comparative study between the use of Foistar (Camostat mesilate) and Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir) on COVID-19 infection.

MethodsPatients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing that were admitted to Seoul Medical Center (Seoul, South Korea) where is the largest public medical center in South Korea between August 1 and September 20, 2020 were included

The data of the patients with pneumonia who received Foistar (Foistar group) during their hospitalization period were primarily collected, and the patients who received Kaletra (Kaletra group) during their hospitalization period were matched to have a similar age group to that of Foistar group so that three times the number of Foistar group patients were randomly selected into Kaletra group and their body temperature, CRP level, WBC count, and event of diarrhea were collected, accordingly.

ResultsA total of 29 patients (7 Foistar group and 22 Kaletra group) was included. The median age was 69, and all had mild COVID-19 (WHO ordinal scale 3 or 4) on admission. 6 patients out of 7 patients (85.71%) from Foistar group who exhibited elevated CRP levels (CRP >0.4mg/dL) on admission have controlled their CRP levels to the normal range. In Kaletra group, 11 out of 18 patients (61.11%) have controlled their CRP levels to the normal range, and only 1 of 2 patients (50.00%) who had normal CRP level has maintained his or her normal CRP level. The difference in the white blood cell counts was not significant between two groups. None of the patients in the study had hyperkalemia.

ConclusionThis study has found a probable association of controlling inflammatory reactions and fever in COVID-19 patients with Foistar (camostat mesilate) use. In addition, there was no significant adverse drug event found from this study upon the Foistar use. These results may encourage the use of Foistar as a treatment option for the patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.","Choi, J.-P.; Choi, J.-P.; Kim, H.-J.; Han, J.; Park, S.; Han, J.",2020-12-15,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.12.10.20240689,1,Jae-Phil Choi,"Seoul Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.20240689v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.20240689v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
8611,SARS-CoV-2 infection: the environmental endurance of the virus can be influenced by the increase of temperature,"ABSRACTThe COVID-19 disease, a respiratory disease transmitted by a new betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2. As for other viral respiratory agents, SARS-CoV-2 spreads by person to person through respiratory droplets and direct contact and potentially by indirect contact through fomites. The goal of the current study is to evaluate whether the increase of temperature can influence the environmental endurance of SARS-CoV-2.

We tested SARS-CoV-2 environmental stability in parallel at room temperature (RT, 20{degrees}C-25{degrees}C) and at average maximum temperature of June (JT) estimated at 28{degrees}C in Italy. The virus inoculated on plastic surface was harvested at predefined time-points and tested to evaluate viral titres on Vero cells by TCID50.

Our results confirm that fomite transmission of the emerging SARS-CoV2 is possible, since the virus remains viable on surfaces up to 84 hours at both RT and JT. Moreover, a remarkable difference between the two temperatures exists, suggesting that virus vitality can be influenced by the environmental temperature.

Our results support the hypothesis that in the hot season the increase of temperature could influence the environmental endurance of SARS-CoV2 and reduce Covid-19 transmission probability.","Magurano, F.; Baggieri, M.; Marchi, A.; Rezza, G.; Nicoletti, L.; Covid-19 Study Group,  ",2020-06-01,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.05.30.20099143,1,Fabio Magurano,Istituto Superiore di Sanita\',https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.30.20099143v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.30.20099143v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.cmi.2020.10.034

17424,Retrospective assessment of SARS-COV2 virus circulation during lockdown in two hospital childcare centers hosting healthcare workers children in a French area of high transmission.,"BackgroundEvidence as to whether childcare and school closure limits the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus is limited, especially because the role of children in SARS-CoV2 transmission remains unclear.

MethodsBetween May 29 and July 2, 2020, a retrospective cohort study was conducted among two populations: requisitioned health-care workers and requisitioned staff from hospitals childcare centers, to investigate the virus circulation during lockdown, in a French area of high transmission.

ResultsThe infection attack rate was 6/52 (11.6%) and 8/46 (17.4%) among health-care workers and childcare staff, respectively. An early epidemic occurred among Montreuil s hospital childcare staff, but the parents were not affected (p=0.029). Among Aulnay-sous-bois childcare center, three staff members were infected but none of them was in charge of a child whose parents were infected. Also among the parents of the children they cared for, none developed antibodies. Out of 14 infections, 12 were reliable to a source of transmission, mostly among colleagues.

Discussion-conclusionThe assessment of viral circulation among healthcare workers and childcare staff suggests that the children did not contribute to SARS-CoV-2 spread in our setting.","Penot, P.; Delaval, A.",2020-10-30,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.10.28.20191981,1,Pauline Penot,Centre hospitalier intercommunal Andre Gregoire,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.28.20191981v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.28.20191981v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
23898,"The Spike-specific IgA in milk commonly-elicited after SARS-Cov-2 infection is concurrent with a robust secretory antibody response, exhibits neutralization potency strongly correlated with IgA binding, and is highly durable over time","Approximately 10% of infants will experience COVID-19 illness requiring advanced care (1). A potential mechanism to protect this population could be provided by passive immunity through the milk of a previously infected mother. We and others have reported on the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in human milk (2-5). We now report the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgA in the milk of 75 COVID-19-recovered participants, and find that 88% of samples are positive for Spike-specific IgA. In a subset of these samples, 95% exhibited robust IgA activity as determined by endpoint binding titer, with 50% considered high-titer. These IgA positive specimens were also positive for Spike-specific antibodies bearing the secretory component. Levels of IgA antibodies and antibodies bearing secretory component were shown to be strongly positively correlated. The secretory IgA response was dominant among the milk samples tested compared to the IgG response, which was present in 75% of samples and found to be of high-titer in only 13% of cases. Our IgA durability analysis using 28 paired samples, obtained 4-6 weeks and 4-10 months after infection, found that all samples exhibited persistently significant Spike-specific IgA, with 43% of donors exhibiting increasing IgA titers over time. Finally, COVID-19 and pre-pandemic control milk samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies; 6 of 8 COVID-19 samples exhibited neutralization of Spike-pseudotyped VSV (IC50 range, 2.39 - 89.4ug/mL) compared to 1 of 8 controls. IgA binding and neutralization capacities were found to be strongly positively correlated. These data are highly relevant to public health, not only in terms of the protective capacity of these antibodies for breastfed infants, but also for the potential use of such antibodies as a COVID-19 therapeutic, given that secretory IgA is highly stable not only in milk and the infant mouth and gut, but in all mucosa including the gastrointestinal tract, upper airway, and lungs (6).","Fox, A.; Marino, J.; Amanat, F.; Oguntuyo, K.

25017,Covid-19: Early evening curfews are not effective and may backfire,"BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, some countries have introduced early evening curfews. Several studies try measure the effectiveness of such measures across different countries, but clear identification of effects is elusive.

ObjectiveWe examined the impact of an early evening curfew on mobility by studying a shift in curfews from 9pm to 6pm in Greece.

Data and MethodsWe took advantage of a natural experiment in Greece, where curfews shifted from 9pm to 6pm in one Region, but not in another. We followed a difference-in-differences econometric approach, where we compared trends in mobility in groceries and pharmacies as well as residential spaces before and after the introduction of the 6pm curfew, in the two regions.

ResultsThe relative difference in the time spent in groceries and pharmacies between the two regions before and after the intervention, is statistically insignificant [coeff: -9.95; 95%CI -44.358 to 24.458]. The relative increase in time spent at residential spaces after the 6pm curfew was only 4.625 percentage points [coeff: 4.625; 95%CI 1.412 to 7.838].

ConclusionsWe found that the 6pm instead of 9pm curfew in Athens led to a 4.63 percentage point relative increase in time spent at home and had no effect on time spent in groceries and pharmacies. Considering that this was a result of a 18.75% reduction in hours where people were allowed to leave home, it seems that the early evening curfew led to more crowding in indoor spaces - which may facilitate the spread of disease. Interventions should be based on a thorough analysis of human behaviour, that anticipates substitution of activities.","Vandoros, S.; Velias, A.; Georganas, S.",2021-04-15,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2021.04.13.21255091,1,Sotiris Georganas,City University London,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.13.21255091v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.13.21255091v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
6588,Impact of essential workers in the context of social distancing for epidemic control,"Many governments have responded to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic by imposing social policies that restrict interactions outside of the home, resulting in a large fraction of the workforce either working from home or not working. However, to maintain essential services, a substantial number of workers are not subject to these limitations, and maintain many of their pre-intervention interactions. To explore how interactions among such """"essential"""" workers, and between essential workers and the rest of the population, impact disease risk and the effectiveness of pandemic control, we evaluated several models of essential worker interactions within a standard epidemiology framework. The models were designed to correspond to key characteristics of, respectively, cashiers, factory employees, and healthcare workers. We find in all three models that essential workers are at substantially elevated risk of infection compared to the rest of the population, and that increasing the numbers of essential workers necessitates the imposition of more stringent interaction controls on the rest of the population in order to manage the pandemic. However, different archetypes of essential workers differ in both their individual probability of infection and impact on the broader pandemic, highlighting the need to understand and target for intervention the specific risks faced by different groups of essential workers.","Milligan, W.

Limited data are available characterizing SARS-Cov-2 infection in the United States.

ObjectiveTo determine associations between demographic and clinical factors and testing positive for coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19+), and among Covid-19+ subsequent hospitalization and intensive care.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsRetrospective cohort study including all patients tested for Covid-19 between February 8 and March 30, 2020, inclusive. We extracted electronic health record data from the national Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, on 2,026,227 patients born between 1945 and 1965 and active in care.

ExposuresDemographic data, comorbidities, medication history, substance use, vital signs, and laboratory measures. Laboratory tests were analyzed first individually and then grouped into a validated summary measure of physiologic injury (VACS Index).

Main Outcomes and MeasuresWe evaluated which factors were associated with Covid-19+ among all who tested. Among Covid-19+ we identified factors associated with hospitalization or intensive care. We identified independent associations using multivariable and conditional multivariable logistic regression with multiple imputation of missing values.

ResultsAmong Veterans aged 54-75 years, 585/3,789 (15.4%) tested Covid-19+. In adjusted analysis (C-statistic=0.806) black race was associated with Covid-19+ (OR 4.68, 95% CI 3.79-5.78) and the association remained in analyses conditional on site (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.89-3.46).

In adjusted models, laboratory abnormalities (especially fibrosis-4 score [FIB-4] >3.25 OR 8.73, 95% CI 4.11-18.56), and VACS Index (per 5-point increase OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.43-1.84) were strongly associated with hospitalization. Associations were similar for intensive care. Although significant in unadjusted analyses, associations with comorbid conditions and medications were substantially reduced and, in most cases, no longer significant after adjustment.

Conclusions and RelevanceBlack race was strongly associated with Covid-19+, but not with hospitalization or intensive care. Among Covid-19+, risk of hospitalization and intensive care may be better characterized by laboratory measures and vital signs than by comorbid conditions or prior medication exposure.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with testing positive for coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19+), and among Covid-19+ subsequent hospitalization and intensive care among Veterans in the United States?

FindingsIn this retrospective cohort study of 2,026,227 Veterans aged 54-75 years and active in care, 585/3,789 (15.4%) tested Covid-19+. Black race was strongly associated with Covid-19+, but not with hospitalization or intensive care. Among Covid-19+, laboratory abnormalities and a summary measure of physiologic injury were strongly associated with hospitalization and intensive care.

MeaningRacial differences in testing positive for Covid-19 may be an underestimate of the general population as racial health disparities in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System tend to be smaller than in the private sector. Risk of hospitalization and intensive care may be better characterized by laboratory measures and vital signs than by comorbid conditions or prior medication exposure.","Rentsch, C.

25513,Contrasting epidemiology and population genetics of COVID-19 infections defined with 74 polymorphic loci in SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled globally.,"SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus causing COVID-19, has infected and killed several millions of people worldwide. Since the first COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved with a few genetic variants associated with higher infectivity. We aimed to identify polymorphic loci in SARS-CoV-2 that can be used to define and monitor the viral epidemiology and population genetics in different geographical regions. Between December 2019 and September 2020, we sampled 5,959 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. More than 80% of the genomes sampled in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania and South America were reportedly isolated from clinical infections in older patients, [&ge;] 20 years. We used the first indexed genome (NC_045512.2) as a reference and constructed multilocus genotypes (MLGs) for each sampled genome based on amino acids detected at 74 polymorphic loci located in ORF1ab, ORF3a, ORF8, matrix (M), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) genes. Eight of the 74 loci were informative in estimating the risk of carrying infections with mutant alleles among different age groups, gender and geographical regions. Four mutant alleles - ORF1ab L4715, S G614, and N K203 and R204 reached 90% prevalence globally, coinciding with peaks in transmission but not COVID-19 severity, from March to August 2020. During this period, the MLG genetic diversity was moderate in Asia, Oceania and North America; in contrast to Africa, Europe and South America, where lower genetic diversity and absence of linkage disequilibrium indicated clonal SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Despite close relatedness to Asian MLGs, MLGs in the global population were genetically differentiated by geographic region, suggesting structure in SARS-CoV-2 populations. Our findings demonstrate the utility of the 74 loci as a genetic tool to study and monitor SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and evolution, which can inform future control interventions.","Chan, F.; Ataide, R.; Richards, J.

We have reported a simple method to inactivate artificially influenza virus-contaminated medical mask without affecting the filterability of mask by heating with hair dryer for 30min. In this study, we extended our studies to optimize our protocols and evaluate the filterability of mask after several-rounds of heat treatment. We found that baking at 70{degrees}C for 30min almost completely inactivated virus as hair dryer treatment for 30min described before. One-round of heat treatment with hair dryer for 30min or baking at 70{degrees}C for 30min did not affect filterability of mask whilst two-rounds of treatment slightly but significantly reduced filterability of mask. Thus, heating with hair dryer for 30min or baking at 70{degrees}C for 30min can inactive contaminated medical mask and the treated mask can be reused at least once.","Song, W.; Pan, B.; Kan, H.; Xu, Y.; Yi, Z.",2020-07-06,Public And Global Health,10.1101/2020.07.01.20144527,1,Zhigang Yi,"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE/NHC/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.01.20144527v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.01.20144527v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
13394,COVID-19 Severity Index: predictive score for hospitalized patients,"IntroductionPandemics pose a major challenge for public health preparedness, requiring a coordinated international response and the development of solid containment plans. An early and accurate identification of high-risk patients in the course of the actual COVID-19 pandemic is vital for planning and for making proper use of available resources.

ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to identify the key variables to create a predictive model that could be used effectively for triage.

MethodsA narrative literature review of 651 articles was conducted to assess clinical, laboratory and imaging findings of COVID-19 confirmed cases. After screening, 10 articles met the inclusion criteria and a list of suggested variables was gathered. A modified Delphi process analysis was performed to consult experts in order to generate a final list of variables for the creation of the predictive model.

ResultsThe modified Delphi process analysis identified 44 predictive variables that were used for building a severity prediction score, the COVID-19 Severity Index.

ConclusionSpecifically designed for current COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 Severity Index could be used as a reliable tool for strategic planning, organization and administration of resources by easily identifying hospitalized patients with higher risk of transfer to Intensive Care Unit (ICU).","Huespe, I.; Carboni Bisso, I.; Gemelli, N.

3324,In search for the hotspots of Disease X: A biogeographic approach to mapping the predictive risk of WHO s Blueprint Priority Diseases,"Anthropization of natural habitats including climate change along with overpopulation and global travel have been contributing to emerging infectious diseases outbreaks. The recent COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, highlights such threats to human health, social stability and global trade and economy. We used species distribution modelling and environmental data from satellite imagery to model Blueprint Priority Diseases occurrences. We constructed classical regression and Support Vector Machine models based on environmental predictor variables such as landscape, tree cover loss, climatic covariates. Models were evaluated and a weighed mean was used to map the predictive risk of disease emergence. We mapped the predictive risk for filovirus, Nipah, Rift Valley Fever and coronavirus diseases. Elevation, tree cover loss and climatic covariates were found to significant factors influencing disease emergence. We also showed the relevance of disease biogeography and in the identification potential hotspots for Disease X in regions in Uganda and China.

Article Summary LineIn our study with the use of a biogeographic approach, we were able to identify Wuhan as a potential hotspot of disease emergence in the absence of COVID-19 data and we confirm that distribution of disease emergence in humans is spatially dependent on environmental factors.","Jagadesh, S.; Combe, M.; Nacher, M.; Gozlan, R.

1887,Estimation of the epidemic properties of the 2019 novel coronavirus: A mathematical modeling study,"BackgroundThe 2019 novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has been spreading rapidly in China. Decisions about its pandemic threat and the appropriate level of public health response depend heavily on estimates of its basic reproduction number and assessments of interventions conducted in the early stages of the epidemic.

MethodsWe conducted a mathematical modeling study using five independent methods to assess the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19, using data on confirmed cases obtained from the China National Health Commission for the period 10th January - 8th February. We analyzed the data for the period before the closure of Wuhan city (10th January - 23rd January) and the post-closure period (23rd January - 8th February) and for the whole period, to assess both the epidemic risk of the virus and the effectiveness of the closure of Wuhan city on spread of COVID-19.

FindingsBefore the closure of Wuhan city the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was 4.38 (95% CI: 3.63 - 5.13), dropping to 3.41 (95% CI: 3.16 - 3.65) after the closure of Wuhan city. Over the entire epidemic period COVID-19 had a basic reproduction number of 3.39 (95% CI: 3.09 - 3.70), indicating it has a very high transmissibility.

InterpretationCOVID-19 is a highly transmissible virus with a very high risk of epidemic outbreak once it emerges in metropolitan areas. The closure of Wuhan city was effective in reducing the severity of the epidemic, but even after closure of the city and the subsequent expansion of that closure to other parts of Hubei the virus remained extremely infectious. Emergency planners in other cities should consider this high infectiousness when considering responses to this virus.

5106,Optimal control of the COVID-19 pandemic with non-pharmaceutical interventions,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced societies across the world to resort to social distancing to slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Due to the economic impacts of social distancing, there is growing desire to relax these measures. To characterize a range of possible strategies for control and to understand their consequences, we performed an optimal control analysis of a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Given that the pandemic is already underway and controls have already been initiated, we calibrated our model to data from the US and focused our analysis on optimal controls from May 2020 through December 2021. We found that a major factor that differentiates strategies that prioritize lives saved versus reduced time under control is how quickly control is relaxed once social distancing restrictions expire in May 2020. Strategies that maintain control at a high level until summer 2020 allow for tapering of control thereafter and minimal deaths, whereas strategies that relax control in the short term lead to fewer options for control later and a higher likelihood of exceeding hospital capacity. Our results also highlight that the potential scope for controlling COVID-19 until a vaccine is available depends on epidemiological parameters about which there is still considerable uncertainty, including the basic reproduction number and the effectiveness of social distancing. In light of those uncertainties, our results do not constitute a quantitative forecast and instead provide a qualitative portrayal of possible outcomes from alternative approaches to control.","Perkins, A.; Espana, G.",2020-04-23,Epidemiology,10.1101/2020.04.22.20076018,1,Alex Perkins,University of Notre Dame,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20076018v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20076018v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1007/s11538-020-00795-y
16287,"Clinical, laboratory, and temporal predictors of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 after COVID-19","BackgroundSARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies may protect from reinfection and disease, providing the rationale for administration of plasma containing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (nAb) as a treatment for COVID-19. The clinical factors and laboratory assays to streamline plasma donor selection, and the durability of nAb responses, are incompletely understood.

MethodsAdults with virologically-documented SARS-CoV-2 infection in a convalescent plasma donor screening program were tested for serum IgG to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 domain, nucleoprotein (NP), and for nAb.

ResultsAmongst 250 consecutive persons studied a median of 67 days since symptom onset, 243/250 (97%) were seropositive on one or more assays. Sixty percent of donors had nAb titers [&ge;]1:80. Correlates of higher nAb titer included older age (adjusted OR [AOR] 1.03/year of age, 95% CI 1.00-1.06), male sex (AOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.13-3.82), fever during acute illness (AOR 2.73, 95% CI 1.25-5.97), and disease severity represented by hospitalization (AOR 6.59, 95% CI 1.32-32.96). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of anti-S1 and anti-NP antibody results yielded cutoffs that corresponded well with nAb titers, with the anti-S1 assay being slightly more predictive. NAb titers declined in 37 of 41 paired specimens collected a median of 98 days (range, 77-120) apart (P<0.001). Seven individuals (2.8%) were persistently seronegative and lacked T cell responses.

ConclusionsNab titers correlated with COVID-19 severity, age, and sex. Standard commercially available SARS-CoV-2 IgG results can serve as useful surrogates for nAb testing. Functional nAb levels were found to decline and a small proportion of COVID-19 survivors lack adaptive immune responses.","Boonyaratanakornkit, J.; Morishima, C.; Selke, S.; Zamora, D.; Mcguffin, S.; Shapiro, A.

14054,Cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans: a systematic review,"IntroductionUnderstanding the cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is critical to vaccine development, epidemiological surveillance and control strategies. This systematic review critically evaluates and synthesises the relevant peer-reviewed and pre-print literature published in recent months.

MethodsFor this systematic review, independent keyword-structured literature searches were carried out in MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19 Primer for studies published from 01/01/2020-26/06/2020. Papers were independently screened by two researchers, with arbitration of disagreements by a third researcher. Data were independently extracted into a pre-designed Excel template and studies critically appraised using a modified version of the MetaQAT tool, with resolution of disagreements by consensus. Findings were narratively synthesised.

Results61 articles were included. Almost all studies used observational designs, were hospital-based, and the majority had important limitations. Symptomatic adult COVID-19 cases consistently show peripheral T cell lymphopenia, which positively correlates with increased disease severity, duration of RNA positivity, and non-survival; while asymptomatic and paediatric cases display preserved counts. People with severe or critical disease generally develop more robust, virus-specific T cell responses. T cell memory and effector function has been demonstrated against multiple viral epitopes, and, cross-reactive T cell responses have been demonstrated in unexposed and uninfected adults, but the significance for protection and susceptibility, respectively, remains unclear.

InterpretationA complex pattern of T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been demonstrated, but inferences regarding population level immunity are hampered by significant methodological limitations and heterogeneity between studies. In contrast to antibody responses, population-level surveillance of the cellular response is unlikely to be feasible in the near term. Focused evaluation in specific sub-groups, including vaccine recipients, should be prioritised.","Shrotri, M.; Van Schalkwyk, M. C.

We use simple epidemiological models to explore estimates for the magnitude and timing of future Covid-19 cases given different impacts of the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 as well as its interaction with vaccines and nonpharmaceutical interventions. We find that variations in the immune response to primary SARS-CoV-2 infections and a potential vaccine can lead to dramatically different immunity landscapes and burdens of critically severe cases, ranging from sustained epidemics to near elimination.

21209,Artificial Intelligence for Emotion-Semantic Trending and People Emotion Detection During COVID-19 Social Isolation,"Taking advantage of social media platforms, such as Twitter, this paper provides an effective framework for emotion detection among those who are quarantined. Early detection of emotional feelings and their trends help implement timely intervention strategies. Given the limitations of medical diagnosis of early emotional change signs during the quarantine period, artificial intelligence models provide effective mechanisms in uncovering early signs, symptoms and escalating trends. Novelty of the approach presented herein is a multitask methodological framework of text data processing, implemented as a pipeline for meaningful emotion detection and analysis, based on the Plutchik/Ekman approach to emotion detection and trend detection. We present an evaluation of the framework and a pilot system. Results of confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework for topic trends and emotion detection of COVID-19 tweets. Our findings revealed Stay-At-Home restrictions result in people expressing on twitter both negative and positive emotional semantics (feelings), where negatives are """"Anger"""" (8.5% of tweets), followed by """"Fear"""" (5.2%), """"Anticipation"""" (53.6%) and positive emotional semantics are """"Joy"""" (14.7%) and """"Trust"""" (11.7%). Semantic trends of safety issues related to staying at home rapidly decreased within the 28 days and also negative feelings related to friends dying and quarantined life increased in some days. These findings have potential to impact public health policy decisions through monitoring trends of emotional feelings of those who are quarantined. The framework presented here has potential to assist in such monitoring by using as an online emotion detection tool kit.","Jelodar, H.; Orji, R.; Matwin, S.; Weerasinghe, S.; Oyebode, O.; Wang, Y.",2021-01-24,Health Informatics,10.1101/2021.01.16.21249943,1,Hamed Jelodar,Nanjing University of Science and Tchonology,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.16.21249943v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.16.21249943v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
18338,Low Dose Radiation Therapy for COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Pilot Study,"BackgroundThe World Health Organization (WHO) has declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as pandemic in March 2020. Currently there is no vaccine or specific effective treatment for COVID-19. The major cause of death in COVID-19 is severe pneumonia leading to respiratory failure. Radiation in low doses (<100 cGy) has been known for its anti-inflammatory effect and therefore, low dose radiation therapy (LDRT) to lungs can potentially mitigate the severity of pneumonia and reduce mortality. We conducted a pilot trial to study the feasibility and clinical efficacy of LDRT to lungs in the management of patients with COVID-19.

MethodsFrom June to Aug 2020, we enrolled 10 patients with COVID-19 having moderate to severe risk disease [National Early Warning Score (NEWS) of [&ge;]5]. Patients were treated as per the standard COVID-19 management guidelines along with LDRT to both lungs with a dose of 70cGy in single fraction. Response assessment was done based on the clinical parameters using the NEWS.

ResultsAll patients completed the prescribed treatment. Nine patients had complete clinical recovery mostly within a period ranging from 3-7 days. One patient, who was a known hypertensive, showed clinical deterioration and died 24 days after LDRT. No patients showed the signs of acute radiation toxicity.

ConclusionResults of our study (90% response rate) suggest the feasibility and clinical effectiveness of LDRT in COVID-19 patients having moderate to severe risk disease.

23595,Magnesium Treatment on Methylation Changes of Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2),"BackgroundThe viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 requires host-expressed TMPRSS2 to facilitate the viral spike (S) protein priming.

ObjectivesTo test the hypothesis that Mg treatment leads to DNA methylation changes in TMPRSS2.

MethodsThis study is nested within the Personalized Prevention of Colorectal Cancer Trial (PPCCT), a double-blind 2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial, which enrolled 250 participants from Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Target doses for both Mg and placebo arms were personalized.

ResultsWe found that 12-week of personalized Mg treatment significantly increased 5-mC methylation at cg16371860 (TSS1500, promoter) by 7.2% compared to placebo arm (decreased by 0.1%) in those aged < 65 years old. The difference remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, sex and baseline methylation as well as FDR correction (FDR-adjusted P =0.014). Additionally, Mg treatment significantly reduced 5-hmC level at cg26337277 (close proximity to TSS200 and 5UTR, promoter) by 2.3% compared to increases by 7.1% in the placebo arm after adjusting for covariates in those aged < 65 years old (P=0.003). The effect remained significant at FDR of 0.10 (adjusted P value=0.088).

ConclusionAmong individuals aged younger than 65 years with the Ca:Mg intake ratios equal to or over 2.6, reducing Ca:Mg ratios to around 2.3 increased 5-mC modifications (i.e. cg16371860) and reduced 5-hmC modifications (i.e. cg26337277) in the TMPRSS2 gene. These findings, if confirmed, provide another mechanism for the role of Mg intervention for the prevention of COVID-19 and treatment of early and mild disease by modifying the phenotype of the TMPRSS2 genotype.","Fan, L.; Zhu, X.; Zheng, Y.; Zhang, W.; Seidner, D.

Ad26.COV2.S was administered at a dose level of 5x1010 or 1x1011 viral particles (vp) per vaccination, either as a single dose or as a two-dose schedule spaced by 56 days in healthy adults (18-55 years old; cohort 1a & 1b; n= 402 and healthy elderly >65 years old; cohort 3; n=394). Vaccine elicited S specific antibody levels were measured by ELISA and neutralizing titers were measured in a wild-type virus neutralization assay (wtVNA). CD4+ T-helper (Th)1 and Th2, and CD8+ immune responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). RESULTS We here report interim analyses after the first dose of blinded safety data from cohorts 1a, 1b and 3 and group unblinded immunogenicity data from cohort 1a and 3. In cohorts 1 and 3 solicited local adverse events were observed in 58% and 27% of participants, respectively. Solicited systemic adverse events were reported in 64% and 36% of participants, respectively. Fevers occurred in both cohorts 1 and 3 in 19% (5% grade 3) and 4% (0% grade 3), respectively, were mostly mild or moderate, and resolved within 1 to 2 days after vaccination. The most frequent local adverse event (AE) was injection site pain and the most frequent solicited AEs were fatigue, headache and myalgia. After only a single dose, seroconversion rate in wtVNA (50% inhibitory concentration - IC50) at day 29 after immunization in cohort 1a already reached 92% with GMTs of 214 (95% CI: 177; 259) and 92% with GMTs of 243 (95% CI: 200; 295) for the 5x1010 and 1x1011vp dose levels, respectively. A similar immunogenicity profile was observed in the first 15 participants in cohort 3, where 100% seroconversion (6/6) (GMTs of 196 [95%CI: 69; 560]) and 83% seroconversion (5/6) (GMTs of 127 [95% CI: <58; 327]) were observed for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively. Seroconversion for S antibodies as measured by ELISA (ELISA Units/mL) was observed in 99% of cohort 1a participants (GMTs of 528 [95% CI: 442; 630) and 695 (95% CI: 596; 810]), for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively, and in 100% (6/6 for both dose levels) of cohort 3 with GMTs of 507 (95% CI: 181; 1418) and 248 (95% CI: 122; 506), respectively. On day 14 post immunization, Th1 cytokine producing S-specific CD4+ T cell responses were measured in 80% and 83% of a subset of participants in cohort 1a and 3, respectively, with no or very low Th2 responses, indicative of a Th1-skewed phenotype in both cohorts. CD8+ T cell responses were also robust in both cohort 1a and 3, for both dose levels. CONCLUSIONS The safety profile and immunogenicity after only a single dose are supportive for further clinical development of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp, as a potentially protective vaccine against COVID-19.

13630,Protection Level and Reusability of a Modified Full-Face Snorkel Mask as Alternative Personal Protective Equipment for Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The worldwide outbreak of the COVID-19 drastically increased pressure on medical resources and highlighted the need for rapidly available, large-scale and low-cost personal protective equipment (PPE). In this work, an alternative full-face mask is adapted from a modified snorkel mask to be used as PPE with two medical grade filters and a 3D-printed adapter. As the mask covers the eyes, mouth and nose, it acts as a full-face shield, providing additional protection to healthcare workers. The filtration efficiency of different medical filters is measured for particles below 300 nm to cover the size of the SARS-CoV-2 and small virus-laden droplets. The filtration performance of the adapted full-face mask is characterized using NaCl particles below 500 nm and different fitting scenarios. The mask is compared to a commercial respirator and characterized according to the EN 149 standard, demonstrating that the protection fulfills the requirements for the FFP2 level (filtering face-piece 2, stopping at least 94% of airborne particles). The device shows a good resistance to several cycles of decontamination (autoclaving and ethanol immersion), is easy to be produced locally at low cost and helps addressing the shortage in FFP2 masks and face shields by providing adequate protection to healthcare workers against particles below 500 nm.","Schmitt, J.; Jones, L.

20063,Changes in UK hospital mortality in the first wave of COVID-19: the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol prospective multicentre observational cohort study,"BackgroundMortality rates of UK patients hospitalised with COVID-19 appeared to fall during the first wave. We quantify potential drivers of this change and identify groups of patients who remain at high risk of dying in hospital.

MethodsThe International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK recruited a prospective cohort admitted to 247 acute UK hospitals with COVID-19 in the first wave (March to August 2020). Outcome was hospital mortality within 28 days of admission. We performed a three-way decomposition mediation analysis using natural effects models to explore associations between week of admission and hospital mortality adjusting for confounders (demographics, comorbidity, illness severity) and quantifying potential mediators (respiratory support and steroids).

FindingsUnadjusted hospital mortality fell from 32.3% (95%CI 31.8, 32.7) in March/April to 16.4% (95%CI 15.0, 17.8) in June/July 2020. Reductions were seen in all ages, ethnicities, both sexes, and in comorbid and non-comorbid patients. After adjustment, there was a 19% reduction in the odds of mortality per 4 week period (OR 0.81, 95%CI 0.79, 0.83). 15.2% of this reduction was explained by greater disease severity and comorbidity earlier in the epidemic. The use of respiratory support changed with greater use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV). 22.2% (OR 0.94, 95%CI 0.94, 0.96) of the reduction in mortality was mediated by changes in respiratory support.

InterpretationThe fall in hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients during the first wave in the UK was partly accounted for by changes in case mix and illness severity. A significant reduction was associated with differences in respiratory support and critical care use, which may partly reflect improved clinical decision making. The remaining improvement in mortality is not explained by these factors, and may relate to community behaviour on inoculum dose and hospital capacity strain.

FundingNIHR & MRC

Key points / Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSRisk factors for mortality in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 have been established. However there is little literature regarding how mortality is changing over time, and potential explanations for why this might be. Understanding changes in mortality rates over time will help policy makers identify evolving risk, strategies to manage this and broader decisions about public health interventions.

Added value of this studyMortality in hospitalised patients at the beginning of the first wave was extremely high. Patients who were admitted to hospital in March and early April were significantly more unwell at presentation than patients who were admitted in later months. Mortality fell in all ages, ethnic groups, both sexes and in patients with and without comorbidity, over and above contributions from falling illness severity. After adjustment for these variables, a fifth of the fall in mortality was explained by changes in the use of respiratory support and steroid treatment, along with associated changes in clinical decision-making relating to supportive interventions. However, mortality was persistently high in patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation, and in those patients who received non-invasive ventilation outside of critical care.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe observed reduction in hospital mortality was greater than expected based on the changes seen in both case mix and illness severity. Some of this fall can be explained by changes in respiratory care, including clinical learning. In addition, introduction of community policies including wearing of masks, social distancing, shielding of vulnerable patients and the UK lockdown potentially resulted in people being exposed to less virus.

The decrease in mortality varied depending on the level of respiratory support received. Patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation have persistently high mortality rates, albeit with a changing case-mix, and further research should target this group.

Severe COVID-19 disease has primarily affected older people in the UK. Many of these people, but not all have significant frailty. It is essential to ensure that patients and their families remain at the centre of decision-making, and we continue with an individualised approach to their treatment and care.","Docherty, A.

5383,Estimation of SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality rate by real-time antibody screening of blood donors,"BackgroundThe pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has tremendous consequences for our societies. Knowledge of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is needed to accurately monitor the spread of the epidemic and also to calculate the infection fatality rate (IFR). These measures may help the authorities to make informed decisions and adjust the current societal interventions. Blood donors comprise approximately 4.7% of the similarly aged population of Denmark and blood is donated in all areas of the country. The objective of this study was to perform real-time seroprevalence surveying among blood donors as a tool to estimate previous SARS-CoV-2 infections and the population based IFR.

MethodsAll Danish blood donors aged 17-69 years giving blood April 6 to 17 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and G antibodies using a commercial lateral flow test. Antibody status was compared between areas and an estimate of the IFR was calculated. The seroprevalence was adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity taking the uncertainties of the test validation into account when reporting the 95% confidence intervals (CI).

ResultsThe first 9,496 blood donors were tested and a combined adjusted seroprevalence of 1.7% (CI: 0.9-2.3) was calculated. The seroprevalence differed across areas. Using available data on fatalities and population numbers a combined IFR in patients younger than 70 is estimated at 82 per 100,000 (CI: 59-154) infections.

ConclusionsThe IFR was estimated to be slightly lower than previously reported from other countries not using seroprevalence data. The IFR, including only individuals with no comorbidity, is likely several fold lower than the current estimate. This may have implications for risk mitigation. We have initiated real-time nationwide anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveying of blood donations as a tool in monitoring the epidemic.","Erikstrup, C.; Hother, C. E.; Pedersen, O. B.

19496,Contacts and behaviours of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic at the start of the 2020/21 academic year,"CONQUEST (COroNavirus QUESTionnaire) is an online survey of contacts, behaviour, and COVID-19 symptoms for University of Bristol (UoB) staff/students. We analysed survey results from the start of the 2020/2021 academic year, prior to the second national lockdown (14/09/2020-01/11/2020), where COVID-19 outbreaks led to lockdown of some student halls of residence. The aim of these analyses was to enhance knowledge of student contact patterns to inform infection disease mathematical modelling approaches.

Responses captured information on demographics, contacts on the previous day, symptoms and self-isolation during the prior week, and COVID-19 status.

740 students provided 1261 unique records. Of 42 (3%) students testing positive in the prior fortnight, 99% had been self-isolating. The median number of contacts on the previous day was 2 (interquartile range: 1-5), mode: 1, mean: 6.1; 8% had [&ge;]20 contacts. 57% of student contacts were other UoB students/staff.

12340,Association of contact to small children with mild course of COVID-19,"It is known that severe COVID-19 cases in small children are rare. If a childhood-related infection would be protective against severe course of COVID-19, it would be expected that adults with intensive and regular contact to small children also may have a mild course of COVID-19 more frequently. To test this hypothesis, a survey among 4,010 recovered COVID-19 patients was conducted in Germany. 1,186 complete answers were collected. 6.9% of these patients reported frequent and regular job-related contact to children below 10 years of age and 23.2% had own small children, which is higher than expected. In the relatively small subgroup with intensive care treatment (n=19), patients without contact to small children were overrepresented. These findings are not well explained by age, gender or BMI distribution of those patients and should be validated in other settings.","Dugas, M.; Schrempf, I.

23863,"PREDICTIVE IMMUNOLOGICAL, VIROLOGICAL, AND ROUTINE LABORATORY MARKERS FOR CRITICAL COVID-19 ON ADMISSION.Immunocovid study","IntroductionEarly identification of COVID-19 patients at risk of critical illness is challenging for clinicians. Immunological, virological, and routine laboratory markers to be used in addition to clinical data are needed.

Aim and methodsBlood tests to measure neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), levels of ferritin, CRP, D-dimer, complement components (C3, C4), lymphocyte subsets, and cytokines, and SARS-Cov2 RT-PCR tests were performed in COVID-19 confirmed cases within 48 hours of admission. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were determined by RT-PCR from oral or nasopharyngeal swabs on the day of admission. Severity of symptoms was categorized as mild (grade 1), severe (grade 2), and critical (grade 3).

Results120 patients were included. COVID-19 was mild in 49, severe in 32, and critical in 39. Ferritin >370 ng/mL (OR 16.4, 95% CI 5.3-50.8), D-dimer >440 ng/mL (OR 5.45, 95% CI 2.36-12.61), CRP >7.65 mg/dL (OR 11.54, 95% CI 4.3-30.8), NLR >3.77 (OR 13.4, 95% CI 4.3-41.1), IL-6 >142.5 pg/mL (OR 8.76, 95% CI 3.56-21.54), IL-10 >10.8 pg/mL (OR 16.45, 95% CI 5.32-50.81), sIL-2r (sCD25) >804.5 pg/mL (OR 14.06, 95% CI 4.56-43.28), IL-1Ra >88.4 pg/mL (OR 4.54, 95% CI 2.03-10.17), and IL-18 >144 pg/mL (OR 17.85, 95% CI 6.54-48.78) were associated with critical COVID-19 in the univariate age-adjusted analysis. In the multivariate age-adjusted analysis, this association was confirmed only for ferritin, CRP,NLR, IL-10, sIL-2r, and IL-18. T, B, and NK cells were significantly decreased in critical patients. SARS-CoV-2 was undetected in blood except in 3 patients with indeterminate results. Ct values determined by RT-PCR from oral/nasopharyngeal swabs on admission were not related to symptom severity.

Conclusionlevels of ferritin, D-dimer, CRP, NLR, and cytokines and cytokine receptors IL-6, IL1-Ra, sCD25, IL-18, and IL-10, taken together with clinical data, can contribute to the early identification of critical COVID-19 patients.","Gasalla, M.

11935,Dynamics and significance of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BACKGROUNDCharacterizing the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and developing accurate serologic assays are needed for diagnostic purposes and estimating population-level seroprevalence.

METHODSWe measured the kinetics of early antibody responses to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 259 symptomatic North American patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (up to 75 days after symptom onset) compared to antibody levels in 1548 individuals whose blood samples were obtained prior to the pandemic.

RESULTSBetween 14-28 days from onset of symptoms, IgG, IgA, or IgM antibody responses to RBD were all accurate in identifying recently infected individuals, with 100% specificity and a sensitivity of 97%, 91%, and 81% respectively. Although the estimated median time to becoming seropositive was similar across isotypes, IgA and IgM antibodies against RBD were short-lived with most individuals estimated to become seronegative again by 51 and 47 days after symptom onset, respectively. IgG antibodies against RBD lasted longer and persisted through 75 days post-symptoms. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were highly correlated with neutralizing antibodies targeting the S protein. No cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-targeted antibodies was observed with several known circulating coronaviruses, HKU1, OC 229 E, OC43, and NL63.

CONCLUSIONSAmong symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases, RBD-targeted antibodies can be indicative of previous and recent infection. IgG antibodies are correlated with neutralizing antibodies and are possibly a correlate of protective immunity.","Iyer, A. S.; Jones, F.

9724,Self-reported taste and smell disorders in patients with COVID-19: distinct features in China,"ObjectivesWe aimed to explore the frequencies of nasal symptoms in patients with COVID-19, including loss of smell and taste, as well as their presentation as the first symptom of the disease and their association with the severity of COVID-19.

MethodsIn this retrospective study, 1,206 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included and followed-up by telephone call one month after discharged from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. Demographic data, laboratory values, comorbidities, symptoms, and numerical rating scale scores (0-10) of nasal symptoms were extracted from the hospital medical records, and confirmed or reevaluated by the telephone follow-up.

ResultsFrom COVID-19 patients (N = 1,172) completing follow-up, 199 (17%) subjects had severe COVID-19 and 342 (29.2%) reported nasal symptoms. The most common nasal symptom was loss of taste (20.6%, median score = 6), while 11.4% had loss of smell (median score = 5). The incidence of nasal symptom including loss of smell and loss of taste as the first onset symptom was <1% in COVID-19 patients. Loss of smell or taste scores showed no correlation with the scores of other nasal symptoms. Loss of taste scores, but not loss of smell scores, were significantly increased in severe vs. non-severe COVID-19 patients. Interleukin (IL)-6 and lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) serum levels positively correlated with loss of taste scores. About 80% of COVID-19 patients recovered from smell and taste dysfunction in 2 weeks.

ConclusionIn the Wuhan COVID-19 cohort, only 1 out of 10 hospital admitted patients had loss of smell while 1 out 5 reported loss of taste which was associated to severity of COVID-19. Most patients recovered smell and taste dysfunctions in 2 weeks.","Song, J.; Deng, Y.-K.; Wang, H.; Wang, Z.-C.; Liao, B.; Ma, J.; He, C.; Pan, L.; Liu, Y.; Alobid, I.; Wang, D.-Y.; Zeng, M.; Mullol, J.; Liu, Z.",2020-06-15,Otolaryngology,10.1101/2020.06.12.20128298,1,Zheng Liu,"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.20128298v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.20128298v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1007/s11596-021-2312-7
5576,COVID-19 Outcomes in Saudi Arabia and the UK: A Tale of Two Kingdoms,"BackgroundWhile the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths around the world is starting to peak, it is essential to point out how different countries manage the outbreak and how different measures and experience resulted in different outcomes. This study aimed to compare the effect of the measures taken by Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom (UK) governments on the outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic as predicted by a mathematical model.

MethodData on the numbers of cases, deaths and government measures were collected from Saudis Ministry of Health and Public Health England. A prediction of the trend of cases, deaths and days to peak was then modelled using the mathematical technique, Exponential Logistic Growth and Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) model. The measures taken by the governments and the predicted outcomes were compared to assess effectiveness.

ResultWe found over three months that 22 fast and extreme measures had been taken in Saudi Arabia compared to eight slow and late measures in the UK. This resulted in a decline in numbers of current infected cases per day and mortality in Saudi Arabia compared to the UK. Based on the SIR model, the predicted number of COVID-19 cases in Saudi as of 31st of March was 2,064, while the predicted number of cases was 63012 in the UK. In addition, the pandemic is predicted to peak earlier on the 27th of March in Saudi Arabia compared to the 2nd of May 2020 in the UK. The end of transition phases for Saudi and UK according to the model, were predicted to be on 18th of April and 24th of May, respectively. These numbers relate to early and decisive measures adopted by the Saudi government.

ConclusionWe show that early extreme measures, informed by science and guided by experience, helped reduce the spread and related deaths from COVID-19 in Saudi. Actions were taken by Saudi under the national slogan """"We are all responsible"""" resulted in the observed reduced number of current and predicted cases and deaths compared to the UK approach """"keep calm and carry on"""".","Komies, S.; Aldhahir, A.

4237,Calcium channel blocker amlodipine besylate is associated with reduced case fatality rate of COVID-19 patients with hypertension,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now spread to more than 100 countries posing as a serious threat to the public health on a global scale. Patients with comorbidity such as hypertension suffer more severe infection with elevated case fatality rate. Development of effective anti-viral drug is in urgent need to treat COVID-19 patients. Here we report that calcium channel blockers (CCBs), a type of anti-hypertension drugs that are widely used in the clinics, can significantly inhibit the post-entry replication events of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Comparison with two other major types of anti-hypertension drugs, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), showed that only CCBs display significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy. Combined treatment with chloroquine and CCBs significantly enhanced the anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy. Retrospective clinical investigation of COVID-19 patients revealed that the CCB amlodipine besylate administration was associated with reduced case fatality rate of patients with hypertension. Results from this study suggest that CCB administration for COVID-19 patients with hypertension as the comorbidity might improve the disease outcome.","Zhang, L.; Sun, Y.; Zeng, H.-L.; Peng, Y.; Jiang, X.; Shang, W.-J.; Wu, Y.; Li, S.; Zhang, Y.-L.; Yang, L.; Chen, H.; Jin, R.; Liu, W.; Li, H.; Peng, K.; Xiao, G.",2020-04-14,Pathology,10.1101/2020.04.08.20047134,1,Gengfu Xiao,"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, Hubei, 430071, P.

15513,"An analysis of clinical and geographical metadata of over 75,000 records in the GISAID COVID-19 database","During the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak that caused the coronavirus pandemic it is important now more than ever that scientists and public health officials work side-by-side and use their available resources to track patient information from those that have been affected by the novel coronavirus. The ability to track the disease helps identify possible trends and patterns that can be used by public health officials to make more informed decisions. Tracking data like this may be the key to helping states and countries safely re-open. However, when analyzing large collections of data there is the occurrence of confounding factors such as biases in patient sampling. In this project, a massive collection of COVID-19 data was analyzed, and explored potential biases in patient sampling were explored.","Velazquez, A.; Bustria, M.; Ouyang, Y.; Moshiri, N.",2020-09-23,Infectious Diseases,10.1101/2020.09.22.20199497,1,Niema Moshiri,"University of California, San Diego",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.22.20199497v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.22.20199497v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
14020,A viral perspective on worldwide non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19,"Quantifying the effectiveness of large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 is critical to adapting responses against future waves of the pandemic. By combining phylogenetic data of 5,198 SARS-CoV-2 genomes with the chronology of non-pharmaceutical interventions in 57 countries, we examine how interventions and combinations thereof alter the divergence rate of viral lineages, which is directly related to the epidemic reproduction number. Home containment and education lockdown had the largest independent impacts and were predicted to reduce the reproduction number by 35% and 26%, respectively. However, we find that in contexts with a reproduction number >2, no individual intervention is sufficient to stop the epidemic and increasingly stringent intervention combinations may be required. Our phylodynamic approach can complement epidemiological models to inform public health strategies against COVID-19.","Rasigade, J.-P.; Barray, A.; Shapiro, J.
