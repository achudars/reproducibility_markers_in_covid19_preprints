The virus enters host cells through an interaction between the spike glycoprotein and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Directly preventing this interaction presents an attractive possibility for suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here we report the isolation and characterization of an alpaca-derived single domain antibody fragment, Ty1, that specifically targets the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, directly preventing ACE2 engagement. The nanobody binds with high affinity in the low nM range to the RBD, occluding ACE2. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bound complex at 2.9 Å resolution reveals that Ty1 binds to an epitope on the RBD accessible in both the ‘up’ and ‘down’ conformations and that Ty1 sterically hinders RBD-ACE2 binding. This 12.8 kDa nanobody does not need an Fc domain to neutralize SARS-CoV-2, and can be expressed in high quantities in bacteria, presenting opportunities for manufacturing at scale. Ty1 is therefore an excellent candidate as an intervention against COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",10.1038/s41467-020-18174-5,95,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.02.130161v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.02.130161v2.full.pdf

Recently, viral mutants termed ""variants of concern"" (VOC) have emerged with the potential to escape host immunity. VOC B.1.351 was first discovered in South Africa in late 2020, and causes global concern due to poor neutralization with propensity to evade preexisting immunity from ancestral strains. We tested the efficacy of a spike encoding mRNA vaccine (CVnCoV) against the ancestral strain BavPat1 and the novel VOC B.1.351 in a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. Naive mice and mice immunized with formalin-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 preparation were used as controls. mRNA-immunized mice developed elevated SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibody as well as neutralization titers against the ancestral strain BavPat1. Neutralization titers against VOC B.1.351 were readily detectable but significantly reduced compared to BavPat1. VOC B.1.351-infected control animals experienced a delayed course of disease, yet nearly all SARS-CoV-2 challenged naive mice succumbed with virus dissemination and high viral loads. CVnCoV vaccine completely protected the animals from disease and mortality caused by either viral strain. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in oral swabs, lung, or brain in these groups. Only partial protection was observed in mice receiving the formalin-inactivated virus preparation.

In this study, we applied a single-cell, multi-omic technology to generate the first unified ex vivo characterization of the CD8+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 across 4 major HLA class I alleles. We found that HLA genotype conditions key features of epitope specificity, TCR /{beta} sequence diversity, and the utilization of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive memory T cell pools. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed functionally diverse T cell phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells, associated with both disease stage and epitope specificity.

Most community detection algorithms tend to be un- or semi-supervised and assume that communities are dense network subgraphs, which is not always true, as protein complexes can exhibit diverse network topologies. The few existing supervised machine learning methods are serial and can potentially be improved in terms of accuracy and scalability by using better-suited machine learning models and by using parallel algorithms, respectively. Here, we present Super.Complex, a distributed supervised machine learning pipeline for community detection in networks. Super.Complex learns a community fitness function from known communities using an AutoML method and applies this fitness function to detect new communities. A heuristic local search algorithm finds maximally scoring communities with epsilon-greedy and pseudo-metropolis criteria, and an embarrassingly parallel implementation can be run on a computer cluster for scaling to large networks. In order to evaluate Super.Complex, we propose three new measures for the still outstanding issue of comparing sets of learned and known communities. On a yeast protein-interaction network, Super.Complex outperforms 6 other supervised and 4 unsupervised methods. Application of Super.Complex to a human protein-interaction network with ~8k nodes and ~60k edges yields 1,028 protein complexes, with 234 complexes linked to SARS-CoV-2, with 111 uncharacterized proteins present in 103 learned complexes. Super.Complex is generalizable and can be used in different applications of community detection, with the ability to improve results by incorporating domain-specific features. Learned community characteristics can also be transferred from existing applications to detect communities in a new application with no known communities.

Author summaryCharacterization of protein complexes, i.e. sets of proteins assembling into a single larger physical entity, is important, as such assemblies play many essential roles in cells, ranging from gene regulation (as for the elaborate multiprotein complexes of mRNA transcription and elongation) to establishing the major structural elements of cells (as for key cytoskeletal protein complexes, such as microtubules and their trafficking proteins). Disruption of protein-protein interactions often leads to disease, therefore identifying a complete list of protein complexes allows us to better understand the association of protein and disease. From networks of protein-protein interactions, potential protein complexes can be identified computationally through the application of community detection methods, which flag groups of entities interacting with each other in certain patterns. In this work, we present Super.Complex, a generalizable and scalable supervised machine learning-based community detection algorithm that outperforms existing methods by accurately learning and using patterns from known communities. We propose 3 novel evaluation measures to compare learned and known communities, an outstanding issue. We use Super.Complex to identify 1028 human protein complexes, including 234 complexes linked to SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, and 103 complexes containing 111 uncharacterized proteins.",NA,206,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.22.449395v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.22.449395v1.full.pdf

Since the absence of antibodies does not equate to absence of immune memory, we sought to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B cells in COVID-19 convalescent patients. In this study, we report on the evolution of the overall humoral immune responses on 101 blood samples obtained from 32 COVID-19 convalescent patients between 16 and 233 days post-symptom onset. Our observations indicate that anti-Spike and anti-RBD IgM in plasma decay rapidly, whereas the reduction of IgG is less prominent. Neutralizing activity in convalescent plasma declines rapidly compared to Fc-effector functions. Concomitantly, the frequencies of RBD-specific IgM+ B cells wane significantly when compared to RBD-specific IgG+ B cells, which increase over time, and the number of IgG+ memory B cells which remain stable thereafter for up to 8 months after symptoms onset. With the recent approval of highly effective vaccines for COVID-19, data on the persistence of immune responses are of central importance. Even though overall circulating SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific antibodies contract over time during convalescence, we demonstrate that RBD-specific B cells increase and persist up to 8 months post symptom onset. We also observe modest increases in RBD-specific IgG+ memory B cells and importantly, detectable IgG and sustained Fc-effector activity in plasma over the 8-month period. Our results add to the current understanding of immune memory following SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is critical for the prevention of secondary infections, vaccine efficacy and herd immunity against COVID-19.",NA,83,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.25.428097v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.25.428097v1.full.pdf

Here we report cryo-EM and crystal structures for seven potent NTD-directed neutralizing antibodies in complex with spike or isolated NTD. These structures defined several antibody classes, with at least one observed in multiple convalescent donors. The structures revealed all seven antibodies to target a common surface, bordered by glycans N17, N74, N122, and N149. This site - formed primarily by a mobile {beta}-hairpin and several flexible loops - was highly electropositive, located at the periphery of the spike, and the largest glycan-free surface of NTD facing away from the viral membrane.

Using the SG2 primer pair, designed by Sigma-Aldrich, we were able to detect the equivalent of 1.7x106 viral copies per mL of saliva after heat inactivation; approximately equivalent to the median viral load in symptomatic patients. This would make our assay potentially useful for rapid detection of high-shedding infected individuals. We also provide a comparison of the PCR efficiency and specificity, which varied considerably, across 9 reported primer pairs for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Primer pairs SG2 and CCDC-N showed highest specificity and PCR efficiency. Finally, we provide an alternate primer pair to use as a positive control for human RNA detection in SARS-CoV-2 assays, as we found that the widely used US CDC primers (targeting human RPP30) do not span an exon-exon junction and therefore does not provide an adequate control for the reverse transcription reaction.",NA,77,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.29.109702v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.29.109702v2.full.pdf

The inhibition of the activity of the two key cytokines, IFN{gamma} and IL-6, can significantly reduce or even reverse the development of the cytokine storm. The objective of our investigations is to reveal the anti-inflammatory potential of heparin for prevention and suppression of the development of CRS in acute COVID-19 patients.

The effect of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) on IFN{gamma} signalling inside the stimulated WISH cells was investigated by measuring its antiproliferative activity and the translocation of phosphorylated STAT1 in the nucleus. The mechanism of heparin binding to IFN{gamma} and IL-6 and therefore inhibition of their activity was studied by means of extensive molecular-dynamics simulations. We find that LMWH binds with high affinity to IFN{gamma} and is able to inhibit fully the interaction with its cellular receptor. It also influences the biological activity of IL-6 by binding to either IL-6 or IL-6/IL-6R thus preventing the formation of the IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 signaling complex. Our conclusion is that heparin is a potent anti-inflammatory agent that can be used in acute inflammatory conditions, due to its potential to inhibit both IFN {gamma} and IL-6 signalling pathways. Based on our results and available clinical observations, we suggest the administration of LMWH to COVID-19 patients in the initial stages of the acute phase.

In this study, to understand genome evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the current pandemic, we examined mutations of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 which could inhibit its error-correcting function. First, to obtain functionally important sites of nsp14, we examined 62 representative coronaviruses belonging to alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and unclassified coronaviruses. As a result, 99 out of 527 amino acid sites of nsp14 were evolutionarily conserved. We then examined nsp14 sequences obtained from 28,082 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and identified 6 amino acid changes in nsp14 mutants that were not detected in the 62 representative coronaviruses. We examined genome substitution rates of these mutants and found that an nsp14 mutant with a proline to leucine change at position 203 (P203L) showed a higher substitution rate (35.9 substitutions/year) than SARS-CoV-2 possessing wild-type nsp14 (19.8 substitutions/year). We confirmed that the substitution rate of the P203L is significantly higher than those of other variants containing mutations in structural proteins. Although the number of SARS-CoV-2 variants containing P203L mutation of nsp14 is limited (26), these mutants appeared at least 10 times independently in the current pandemic.

In this regard, the latest SARS-CoV-2 variant, B.1.1.7 lineage, reported from the United Kingdom (UK) is of great significance, in that it contains several mutations that increases its infection and transmission rates as evidenced by the increased number of clinical reports. Specifically, the N501Y mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) domain has been shown to possess increased affinity for ACE2, although the basis for this not yet clear. Here, we dissect the mechanism underlying the increased affinity using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the available ACE2-S1-RBD complex structure (6M0J) and show a prolonged and stable interaction of the Y501 residue in the N501Y mutant S1-RBD with interfacial residues, Y41 and K353, in ACE2 as compared to the wild type S1-RBD. Additionally, we find that the N501Y mutant S1-RBD displays altered dynamics that likely aids in its enhanced interaction with ACE2.

It has been reported that the UK and South African strains may have higher transmission capabilities, eventually due to amino acid substitutions on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The pathogenicity seems modified but is still under investigation. Here we used the experimental structure of the Spike RBD domain co-crystallized with part of the ACE2 receptor and several in silico methods to analyze the possible impacts of three amino acid replacements (Spike K417N, E484K, N501Y) with regard to ACE2 binding. We found that the N501Y replacement in this region of the interface (present in both UK and South African strains) should be favorable for the interaction with ACE2 while the K417N and E484K substitutions (South African) would seem unfavorable. It is unclear if the N501Y substitution in the South African strain could counterbalance the predicted less favorable (regarding binding) K417N and E484K Spike replacements. Our finding suggests that, if indeed the South African strain has a high transmission level, this could be due to the N501Y replacement and/or to substitutions in regions outside the direct Spike-ACE2 interface.

Worldwide concerted effort to identify viral genomic changes across different sub-types has identified several strong changes in the coding region. However, there have not been many studies focusing on the variations in the 5 and 3 untranslated regions and their consequences. Considering the possible importance of these regions in host mediated regulation of viral RNA genome, we wanted to explore the phenomenon.

MethodsTo have an idea of the global changes in 5 and 3-UTR sequences, we downloaded 8595 complete and high-coverage SARS-CoV2 genome sequence information from human host in FASTA format from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) from 15 different geographical regions. Next, we aligned them using Clustal Omega software and investigated the UTR variants. We also looked at the putative host RNA binding protein (RBP) and microRNA binding sites in these regions by  RBPmap and  RNA22 v2 respectively. Expression status of selected RBPs and microRNAs were checked in lungs tissue.

ResultsWe identified 28 unique variants in SARS-CoV2 UTR region based on a minimum variant percentage cut-off of 0.5. Along with 241C>T change the important 5-UTR change identified was 187A>G, while 29734G>C, 29742G>A/T and 29774C>T were the most familiar variants of 3UTR among most of the continents. Furthermore, we found that despite of the variations in the UTR regions, binding of host RBP to them remains mostly unaltered, which further influenced the functioning of specific miRNAs.

ConclusionOur results, shows for the first time in SARS-Cov2 infection, a possible cross-talk between host RBPs-miRNAs and viral UTR variants, which ultimately could explain the mechanism of escaping host RNA decay machinery by the virus. The knowledge might be helpful in developing anti-viral compounds in future.",10.1371/journal.pone.0237559,317,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.09.134585v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.09.134585v2.full.pdf

The effect of the RBD was mimicked by blocking ACE2. A mutated non-binding RBD did not potentiate constriction. A similar RBD-potentiated capillary constriction occurred in human cortical slices.

We report that astodrimer sodium inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells, with 50% effective concentrations (EC50) for i) reducing virus-induced cytopathic effect of 0.002 to 0.012 mg/mL in Vero E6 cells, and ii) infectious virus release by plaque assay of 0.019 to 0.031 mg/mL in Vero E6 cells and 0.031 to 0.045 mg/mL in Calu-3 cells.

With this aim, we performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations on a selected set of possible Spike variants in order to assess the stabilizing effect of particular amino acid substitutions, with a special focus on the mutations that are both characteristic of the top three most worrying variants at the moment, i.e the English, South African and Amazonian ones, and that occur at the molecular interface between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and its human ACE2 receptor. We characterize these variants effect in terms of (i) residues mobility, (ii) compactness, studying the network of interactions at the interface, and (iii) variation of shape complementarity via expanding the molecular surfaces in the Zernike basis. Overall, our analyses highlighted greater stability of the three variant complexes with respect to both the wild type and two negative control systems, especially for the English and Amazonian variants. In addition, in the three variants, we investigate the effects a not-yet observed mutation in position 501 could provoke on complex stability. We found that a phenylalanine mutation behaves similarly to the English variant and may cooperate in further increasing the stability of the South African one, hinting at the need for careful surveillance for the emergence of such kind of mutations in the population.

Apoptotic T cell death following HIV-1 infection leads to a compromised immune system and eventually AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). A review of several studies that focused on long-term survivors of HIV-1 reveals that these survivors had deletion-mutations in Hap. A subset of these survivors changed course and experienced CD4+ T cell death and progression to AIDS. These individuals had virus that regained Hap gene sequence that had previously been deleted. Analysis of the changes in the genetic sequences with in vivo progression of the revertant HIV-1 virus allowed identification of a specific region in Hap we are calling MORT.

Potential human mRNAs targeted by MORT mi/siRNAs include gene/RNA sequences of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), survivin, and apollon, along with many other human gene sites/RNAs.

We found that this course increased science identity and successfully improved key research competencies as per the Undergraduate Research Student Self-Assessment (URSSA) survey. This course is ideal for flipped classrooms ranging from introductory biology to upper-level neuroscience courses and can be integrated directly into the lecture period without the need for building a new course. Given the low cost, recent comfort with virtual learning environments, and the current proliferation of flipped biology classrooms following the 2020 pandemic, this curriculum could serve as an ideal project-based active-learning tool for equitably increasing access to authentic research experiences.",NA,261,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.28.450232v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.28.450232v1.full.pdf

Once inhaled, SARS-CoV-2 particles gain entry into respiratory ciliated cells by interacting with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). It is known that ACE2 functions within the renin-angiotensin system to regulate blood pressure, fluid homeostasis and inflammation. However, it is largely unknown what roles ACE2 has in ciliated cells of the airway. Therefore, understanding the function and nature of ACE2 within airway tissue has become an essential element in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. Airway mucociliary tissue was generated in-vitro using primary human nasal epithelial cells isolated from nasal turbinates of donors and the air-liquid interface (ALI) model of differentiation. Using ALI tissue we cloned transcripts for three distinct variants of ACE2, one of which encodes the full-length ACE2 protein, the other two transcripts are truncated isoforms that had only been predicted to exist via sequence analysis software. We demonstrate that all three isoforms have the capacity to be glycosylated, a known modification of full-length ACE2. Immunofluorescence microscopy of individual ACE2 isoform transfected cells reveals distinct localization of variant 1 relative to X1 and X2. Double staining immunohistochemistry of ALI tissue using antibodies to either the N-term or C-term region of ACE2 revealed distinct and overlapping signals in the apical cytosol of ciliated cells. Most notably only the ACE2 C-term antibody displayed plasma-membrane localization in ciliated cells. We also observed a decrease in the total amount of ACE2 in ALI tissue derived from a 33 year-old male donor when compared to a 34 year-old female donor, thus there may be variation in the abundance of ACE2 protein in the airway among the population. Together, our data begins to highlight the dynamic status of the ACE2 protein in airway mucociliary tissue and we propose multiple ACE2 parameters that may impact an individuals susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. These parameters include the balance of cytosolic versus membrane bound ACE2, isoform expression levels, maintenance of post-translational modifications and the impact of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors on these processes.",NA,70,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.190074v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.190074v2.full.pdf

We observed that retroviruses pseudotyped with SG614 infected ACE2-expressing cells markedly more efficiently than those with SD614. This greater infectivity was correlated with less S1 shedding and greater incorporation of the S protein into the pseudovirion. Similar results were obtained using the virus-like particles produced with SARS-CoV-2 M, N, E, and S proteins.

We find support for three SARS-CoV-2 lineages co-circulating, each with significantly different demographic dynamics concordant with known epidemiological factors. For example, Lineage C emerged in Europe with a high growth rate in late February, just prior to the exponential increase in cases in several European countries. Mutations that characterize Lineage C in particular are non-synonymous and occur in functionally important gene regions responsible for viral replication and cell entry.

In the USA, two highly protective mRNA vaccines are available: BNT162b2 from Pfizer/BioNTech and mRNA-1273 from Moderna (3, 4). These vaccines induce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, including neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) predominantly directed against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) (1-4). Serum NAbs are induced at modest levels within [~]1 week of the first dose, but their titers are strongly boosted by a second dose at 3 (BNT162b2) or 4 weeks (mRNA-1273) (3, 4).

However, the enhancement of computational power, the demand for adaptable predictive frameworks, the short past of the disease, and uncertainties related to input data and prediction rules, also make other classical and machine learning techniques viable options.

OBJECTIVEThis study investigates the efficiency of six models in forecasting COVID-19 confirmed cases with 17 days ahead. We compare the models autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Holt-Winters, support vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbors regressor (KNN), random trees regressor (RTR), seasonal linear regression with change-points (Prophet), and simple logistic regression (SLR).

MATERIAL AND METHODSWe implement the models to data provided by the health surveillance secretary of Amapaa, a Brazilian state fully carved in the Amazon rainforest, which has been experiencing high infection rates. We evaluate the models according to their capacity to forecast in different historical scenarios of the COVID-19 progression, such as exponential increases, sudden decreases, and stability periods of daily cases. To do so, we use a rolling forward splitting approach for out-of-sample validation. We employ the metrics RMSE, R-squared, and sMAPE in evaluating the model in different cross-validation sections.

FINDINGSAll models outperform SLG, especially Holt-Winters, that performs satisfactorily in all scenarios. SVR and ARIMA have better performances in isolated scenarios. To implement the comparisons, we have created a web application, which is available online.

CONCLUSIONThis work represents an effort to assist the decision-makers of Amapa in future decisions to come, especially under scenarios of sudden variations in the number of confirmed cases of Amapa, which would be caused, for instance, by new contamination waves or vaccination. It is also an attempt to highlight alternative models that could be used in future epidemics.",NA,419,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.09.332908v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.09.332908v1.full.pdf

Two datasets for Sars-CoV-2 infection group and BCG-vaccinated group were downloaded. Differentially Expressed Genes were identified. Gene ontology and pathways were functionally enriched, and networking was constructed in NetworkAnalyst. Lastly, correlation between post-BCG vaccination and COVID-19 transcriptome signatures were established. A total of 161 DEGs (113 upregulated DEGs and 48 downregulated genes) were identified in the Sars-CoV-2 group. In the pathway enrichment analysis, cross-reference of upregulated KEGG pathways in Sars-CoV-2 with downregulated counterparts in the BCG-vaccinated group, resulted in the intersection of 45 common pathways, accounting for 86.5% of SARS-CoV-2 upregulated pathways. Of these intersecting pathways, a vast majority were immune and inflammatory pathways with top significance in IL-17, TNF, NOD-like receptors, and NF-{kappa}B signaling pathways. Our data suggests BCG-vaccination may incur a protective role in COVID-19 patients until a targeted vaccine is developed.

The Spike protein, responsible for cell receptor binding and viral internalization, possesses multiple disulfide bonds raising the possibility that disulfide-reducing agents might disrupt Spike function, prevent viral entry and serve as effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Here we show the first experimental evidence that reagents capable of reducing disulfide bonds can inhibit viral infection in cell-based assays. Molecular dynamics simulations of the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) predict increased domain flexibility when the four disulfide bonds of the domain are reduced. This flexibility is particularly prominent for the surface loop, comprised of residues 456-490, which interacts with the Spike cell receptor ACE2. Consistent with this finding, the addition of exogenous disulfide bond reducing agents affects the RBD secondary structure, lowers its melting temperature from 52 to 36-39{degrees}C and decreases its binding affinity to ACE2 by two orders of magnitude at 37{degrees}C. Finally, the reducing agents dithiothreitol (DTT) and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) inhibit viral replication at high {micro}M - low mM levels with a negligible effect on cell viability at these concentrations. The antiviral effect of monothiol-based reductants N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and reduced glutathione (GSH) was not observed due to decreases in cell viability.

Virus entry into the brain also occurred, likely via gustatory-olfactory-trigeminal pathway with eventual compromise to the blood brain barrier. Despite this, no conspicuous signs of disease were observed and no deer mice succumbed to infection. Expression of several innate immune response genes were elevated in the lungs, notably IFN, Cxcl10, Oas2, Tbk1 and Pycard. Elevated CD4 and CD8{beta} expression in the lungs was concomitant with Tbx21, IFN{gamma} and IL-21 expression, suggesting a type I inflammatory immune response. Contact transmission occurred from infected to naive deer mice through two passages, showing sustained natural transmission. In the second deer mouse passage, an insertion of 4 amino acids occurred to fixation in the N-terminal domain of the spike protein that is predicted to form a solvent-accessible loop. Subsequent examination of the source virus from BEI Resources indicated the mutation was present at very low levels, demonstrating potent purifying selection for the insert during in vivo passage. Collectively, this work has determined that deer mice are a suitable animal model for the study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, and that they have the potential to serve as secondary reservoir hosts that could lead to periodic outbreaks of COVID-19 in North America.",NA,532,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.241810v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.241810v1.full.pdf

We aimed to demonstrate the effect of anti-COVID-19 agent remdesivir on renal fibrosis.

MethodsRemdesivir and its active nucleoside metabolite GS-441524 were used to treat TGF-{beta} stimulated renal fibroblasts (NRK-49F) and human renal epithelial cells (HK2). Cell viability was determined by CCK8 assay, and fibrotic markers were measured by Western blotting. Vehicle or remdesivir were given by intraperitoneal injection or renal injection through the left ureter in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mice. Serum and kidneys were harvested. The concentrations of remdesivir and GS-441524 were measured using LC-MS/MS. Renal and liver function were assessed. Renal fibrosis was evaluated by Massons trichrome staining and Western blotting.

ResultsRemdesivir and GS-441524 inhibited cell proliferation and the expression of fibrotic markers (fibronectin, pSmad3, and aSMA) in NRK-49F and HK2 cells. Intraperitoneal injection or renal injection of remdesivir attenuated renal fibrosis of UUO kidneys. Renal and liver function were not changed in remdesivir treated UUO mice.

SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Coronaviridae family, which is transmitted from animal to human and because of being contagious, further it transmitted human to human. Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is known as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019) as a global pandemic. But, no specific medications are available for the treatment of COVID-19 so far. As a corollary, there is a need for a potential vaccine to impede the progression of the disease. Lately, it has been documented that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for viral replication as well as interferes with host immune responses. We have comparatively analyzed the sequences of N protein of SARS-CoV-2 for the identification of core attributes and analyzed the ancestry through phylogenetic analysis. Subsequently, we have predicted the most immunogenic epitope for T-cell as well as B-cell. Importantly, our investigation mainly focused on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I potential peptides and NTASWFTAL interacted with most human leukocyte antigen (HLA) that are encoded by MHC class I molecules.

Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 rapidly adapts to Vero E6 cells that leads to loss of furin cleavage motif in spike protein. The adaptation is achieved by asymptotic expansion of minor virus subpopulations to dominant genotype, but wildtype sequence is maintained at low percentage in the virus swarm, and mediate reverse adaptation once the virus is passaged on human lung cells. The Vero E6-adapted virus show defected cell entry in human lung cells and the mutated spike variants cannot be processed by furin or TMPRSS2. However, the mutated S1/S2 site is cleaved by cathepsins with higher efficiency. Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 can rapidly adapt spike protein to available proteases and advocate for deep sequence surveillance to identify virus adaptation potential and novel variant emergence.

Significance StatementRecently emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants B1.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa) and B.1.1.248 (Brazil) harbor spike mutation and have been linked to increased virus pathogenesis. The emergence of these novel variants highlight coronavirus adaptation and evolution potential, despite the stable consensus genotype of clinical isolates. We show that subdominant variants maintained in the virus population enable the virus to rapidly adapt upon selection pressure. Although these adaptations lead to genotype change, the change is not absolute and genome with original genotype are maintained in virus swarm. Thus, our results imply that the relative stability of SARS-CoV-2 in numerous independent clinical isolates belies its potential for rapid adaptation to new conditions.",NA,9,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.241414v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.241414v2.full.pdf

We found divergent immunological responses in the CNS compartment, including increased levels of IL-12 and IL-12-associated innate and adaptive immune cell activation. Moreover, we found increased proportions of B cells in the CSF relative to the periphery and evidence of clonal expansion of CSF B cells, suggesting a divergent intrathecal humoral response to SARS-CoV-2.

We used a library screening approach to detect binding interactions across one of the largest known panels of membrane-bound and soluble receptors, comprising 5845 targets, expressed recombinantly in human cells. We were able confirm and replicate SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 and other putative coreceptors such as CD209 and CLEC4M. More significantly, we identified interactions with a number of novel SARS-CoV-2 S binding proteins. Three of these novel receptors, NID1, CNTN1 and APOA4 were specific to SARS-CoV-2, and not SARS-COV, with APOA4 binding the S-protein with equal affinity as ACE2. With this knowledge we may further understand the disease pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients and how infection by SARS-CoV-2 may lead to differences in pathology in specific organs or indeed the virulence observed in different ethnicities.

The gravity of the situation mandates accelerated efforts to identify safe and effective vaccines. Here, we generated measles virus (MeV)-based vaccine candidates expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S). Insertion of the full-length S protein gene in two different MeV genomic positions resulted in modulated S protein expression. The variant with lower S protein expression levels was genetically stable and induced high levels of effective Th1-biased antibody and T cell responses in mice after two immunizations. In addition to neutralizing IgG antibody responses in a protective range, multifunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses with S protein-specific killing activity were detected. These results are highly encouraging and support further development of MeV-based COVID-19 vaccines.

Significance StatementThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, yet. Therefore, effective vaccine concepts are urgently needed. In search for such a concept, we have analysed a measles virus-based vaccine candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2. Using this well known, safe vaccine backbone, we demonstrate here induction of functional immune responses in both arms of adaptive immunity with the desired immune bias. Therefore, occurrence of immunopathologies such as antibody-dependent enhancement or enhanced respiratory disease is rather unlikely. Moreover, the candidate still induces immunity against the measles, recognized as a looming second menace, when countries are entrapped to stop routine vaccination campaigns in the face of COVID-19. Thus, a bivalent measles-based COVID-19 vaccine could be the solution for two significant public health threats.",NA,302,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.198291v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.198291v1.full.pdf

Effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. We recently discovered four SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitors including boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII and GC-376 with potent antiviral activity against infectious SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. Despite the weaker enzymatic inhibition of calpain inhibitors II and XII against Mpro compared to GC-376, calpain inhibitors II and XII had more potent cellular antiviral activity. This observation promoted us to hypothesize that the cellular antiviral activity of calpain inhibitors II and XII might also involve the inhibition of cathepsin L in addition to Mpro. To test this hypothesis, we tested calpain inhibitors II and XII in the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay in Vero E6 cells and found that both compounds significantly decreased pseudoviral particle entry into cells, indicating their role in inhibiting cathepsin L. The involvement of cathepsin L was further confirmed in the drug time-of-addition experiment. In addition, we found that these four compounds not only inhibit SARS-CoV-2, but also SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, as well as human coronaviruses (CoVs) 229E, OC43, and NL63. The mechanism of action is through targeting the viral Mpro, which was supported by the thermal shift binding assay and enzymatic FRET assay. We further showed that these four compounds have additive antiviral effect when combined with remdesivir.

However, partner proteins that elucidate PKP2 cellular mechanism to understand cardiac dysfunction in ACM are mostly unknown. Here we identify the actin-based motor proteins Myh9 and Myh10 as key PKP2 interactors, and demonstrate that the expression of the ACM-related PKP2 mutant R735X alters actin fiber organization and cell mechanical stiffness. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 protein acts similarly to this known pathogenic R735X mutant, altering the actomyosin component distribution on cardiac cells. Our data reveal that the viral Nsp1 hijacks PKP2 into the cytoplasm and mimics the effect of delocalized R735X mutant. These results demonstrate that cytoplasmic PKP2, wildtype or mutant, induces the collapse of the actomyosin network, since shRNA-PKP2 knockdown maintains the cell structure, validating a critical role of PKP2 localization in the regulation of actomyosin architecture. The fact that Nsp1 and PKP2 mutant R735X share similar phenotypes also suggests that direct SARS-CoV-2 heart infection could induce a transient ACM-like disease in COVID-19 patients, which may contribute to right ventricle dysfunction, observed in patients with poor survival prognosis.

We found that intranasal inoculation with higher viral doses (2x103 and 2x104 PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 caused lethality of all mice and severe damage of various organs, including lungs, liver, and kidney, while lower doses (2x101 and 2x102 PFU) led to less severe tissue damage and some mice recovered from the infection. In this humanized hACE2 mouse model, SARS-CoV-2 infection damaged multiple tissues, with a dose-dependent effect in most tissues. Similar damage was observed in biopsy samples from COVID-19 patients. Finally, the mice that recovered after infection with a low dose of virus also survived rechallenge with a high dose of virus. Compared to other existing models, the K18-hACE2 model seems to be the most sensitive COVID-19 model reported to date. Our work expands the information available about this model to include analysis of multiple infectious doses and various tissues with comparison to human biopsy samples from COVID-19 patients.

One of the main drug target proteins proposed so far is the SARS-CoV-2 viral protease 3CLpro (also called Mpro), an essential component for viral replication. Ongoing ligand- and receptor-based computational screening efforts would be facilitated by an improved understanding of the electrostatic, hydrophobic and steric features that characterize small molecule inhibitors binding stably to 3CLpro, as well as by an extended collection of known binders.

Here, we present combined virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulation, machine learning and in vitro experimental validation analyses which have led to the identification of small molecule inhibitors of 3CLpro with micromolar activity, and to a pharmacophore model that describes functional chemical groups associated with the molecular recognition of ligands by the 3CLpro binding pocket. Experimentally validated inhibitors using a ligand activity assay include natural compounds with available prior knowledge on safety and bioavailability properties, such as the natural compound rottlerin (IC50 = 37 M), and synthetic compounds previously not characterized (e.g. compound CID 46897844, IC50 = 31 M). In combination with the developed pharmacophore model, these and other confirmed 3CLpro inhibitors may provide a basis for further similarity-based screening in independent compound databases and structural design optimization efforts, to identify 3CLpro ligands with improved potency and selectivity.

Overall, this study suggests that the integration of virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning can facilitate 3CLpro-targeted small molecule screening investigations. Different receptor-, ligand- and machine learning-based screening strategies provided complementary information, helping to increase the number and diversity of identified active compounds. Finally, the resulting pharmacophore model and experimentally validated small molecule inhibitors for 3CLpro provide resources to support follow-up computational screening efforts for this drug target.",NA,66,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.02.433618v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.02.433618v1.full.pdf

Various anti-inflammatory therapeutics have shown mixed efficacy in treating COVID-19, and the mechanisms by which hyperinflammation occurs are not well understood. Previous research indicated that monocytes, a key innate immune cell, undergo metabolic reprogramming and produce inflammatory cytokines when stimulated with SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized that binding by the viral spike protein mediates this effect, and that drugs which regulate immunometabolism could inhibit the inflammatory response in monocytes. Monocytes stimulated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit 1 showed a dose-dependent increase in glycolytic metabolism that was associated with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-. This response was dependent on hypoxia-inducible factor-1, as chetomin inhibited glycolysis and cytokine production. Inhibition of glycolytic metabolism by 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) or glucose deprivation also inhibited the glycolytic response, and 2-DG strongly suppressed cytokine production. Glucose-deprived monocytes rescued cytokine production by upregulating oxidative phosphorylation, an effect which was not present in 2-DG-treated monocytes due to the known effect of 2-DG on suppressing mitochondrial metabolism. Finally, pre-treatment of monocytes with metformin strongly suppressed spike protein-mediated cytokine production in monocytes, and abrogated glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism. Likewise, metformin pre-treatment blocked cytokine induction by SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020 in direct infection experiments in monocytes. In summary, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces a pro-inflammatory immunometabolic response in monocytes that can be suppressed by metformin, and metformin likewise suppresses inflammatory responses to live SARS-CoV-2.

In the current study, SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was investigated for the presence of large scale internal RNA base pairing in its genome. This property, termed genome scale ordered RNA structure (GORS) has been previously associated with host persistence in other positive-strand RNA viruses, potentially through its shielding effect on viral RNA recognition in the cell. Genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were remarkably structured, with minimum folding energy differences (MFEDs) of 15%, substantially greater than previously examined viruses such as HCV (MFED 7-9%). High MFED values were shared with all coronavirus genomes analysed created by several hundred consecutive energetically favoured stem-loops throughout the genome. In contrast to replication-association RNA structure, GORS was poorly conserved in the positions and identities of base pairing with other sarbecoviruses - even similarly positioned stem-loops in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV rarely shared homologous pairings, indicative of more rapid evolutionary change in RNA structure than in the underlying coding sequences. Sites predicted to be base-paired in SARS-CoV-2 showed substantially less sequence diversity than unpaired sites, suggesting that disruption of RNA structure by mutation imposes a fitness cost on the virus which is potentially restrictive to its longer evolution.

For this, we took an unbiased proteomic approach for analyses of exosomes isolated from plasma of healthy volunteers and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Our results revealed that tenascin-C (TNC) and fibrinogen-{beta} (FGB) are highly abundant in exosomes from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients plasma as compared to that of healthy normal controls.

Together, our results demonstrated that soluble mediators, like TNC and FGB, are transported through plasma exosomes in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and trigger pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in cells of distant organs in COVID-19 patients.

ImportanceExosomes play an important role in intercellular communication by inducing physiological changes in recipient cells by transferring bioactive proteins.

This approach is multi-tiered, beginning with compiling the theoretical protein sequences from genomic derived data. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 we begin with 496 peptides that would be produced by proteolytic digestion of the viral proteins. To eliminate peptides that would cause cross-reactivity and false positives we remove peptides from consideration that have sequence homology or similar chemical characteristics using a progressively larger database of background peptides. Using this pipeline, we can remove 47 peptides from consideration as diagnostic due to the presence of peptides derived from the human proteome. To address the complexity of the human microbiome, we describe a method to create a database of all proteins of relevant abundance in the saliva microbiome. By utilizing a protein-based approach to the microbiome we can more accurately identify peptides that will be problematic in COVID-19 studies which removes 12 peptides from consideration. To identify diagnostic peptides, another 7 peptides are flagged for removal following comparison to the proteome backgrounds of viral and bacterial pathogens of similar clinical presentation. By aligning the protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 field isolates deposited to date we can identify peptides for removal due to their presence in highly variable regions that may lead to false negatives as the pathogen evolves. We provide maps of these regions and highlight 3 peptides that should be avoided as potential diagnostic or vaccine targets. Finally, we leverage publicly deposited proteomics data from human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, as well as a second study with the closely related MERS-CoV to identify the two proteins of highest abundance in human infections. The resulting final list contains the 24 peptides most unique and diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These peptides represent the best targets for the development of antibodies are clinical diagnostics. To demonstrate one application of this we model peptide fragmentation using a deep learning tool to rapidly generate targeted LCMS assays and data processing method for detecting CoVID-19 infected patient samples.

In the current drug repurposing study, we identified the leukotriene (D4) receptor antagonist Montelukast as a novel agent that simultaneously targets two important drug targets of SARS-CoV-2. We initially demonstrated the dual inhibition profile of Montelukast through multiscale molecular modeling studies. Next, we characterized its effect on both targets by different in vitro experiments including the Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based main protease enzyme inhibition assay, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, pseudovirus neutralization on HEK293T / hACE2, and virus neutralization assay using xCELLigence MP real time cell analyzer. Our integrated in silico and in vitro results confirmed the dual potential effect of the Montelukast both on virus entry into the host cell (Spike/ACE2) and on the main protease enzyme inhibition. The virus neutralization assay results showed that while no cytotoxicity of the Montelukast was observed at 12 M concentration, the cell index time 50 (CIT50) value was delayed for 12 hours. Moreover, it was also shown that Favipiravir, a well-known antiviral used in COVID-19 therapy, should be used by 16-fold higher concentrations than Montelukast in order to have the same effect of Montelukast. The rapid use of new small molecules in the pandemic is very important today. Montelukast, whose pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties are very well characterized and has been widely used in the treatment of asthma since 1998, should urgently be completed in clinical phase studies and if its effect is proven in clinical phase studies, it should be used against COVID-19.",NA,112,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.26.424423v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.26.424423v1.full.pdf

Metal ions embedded into PPE may inactivate respiratory viruses, but confounding factors such as absorption of viruses make measuring and optimizing the inactivation characteristics difficult. Here we used polyamide 6.6 (PA66) fibers that had zinc ions embedded during the polymerisation process and systematically investigated if these fibers can absorb and inactivate pandemic SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus H1N1. We find that these viruses are readily absorbed by PA66 fabrics and inactivated by zinc ions embedded into this fabric. The inactivation rate (pfu{middle dot}gram-1{middle dot}min-1) exceeds the number of active virus particles expelled by a cough and supports a wide range of viral loads. Moreover, we found that the zinc content and the virus inactivating property of the fabric remain stable over 50 standardized washes.

Here, we compared a variety of replication features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and analysed the cytopathology caused by the two closely related viruses in the commonly used Vero E6 cell line. Compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 generated higher levels of intracellular viral RNA, but strikingly about 50-fold less infectious viral progeny was recovered from the culture medium. Immunofluorescence microscopy of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells established extensive cross-reactivity of antisera previously raised against a variety of nonstructural proteins, membrane and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV. Electron microscopy revealed that the ultrastructural changes induced by the two SARS viruses are very similar and occur within comparable time frames after infection. Furthermore, we determined that the sensitivity of the two viruses to three established inhibitors of coronavirus replication (Remdesivir, Alisporivir and chloroquine) is very similar, but that SARS-CoV-2 infection was substantially more sensitive to pre-treatment of cells with pegylated interferon alpha. An important difference between the two viruses is the fact that - upon passaging in Vero E6 cells - SARS-CoV-2 apparently is under strong selection pressure to acquire adaptive mutations in its spike protein gene.

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic is an RNA virus prone to mutations. Formation of a stable binding interface between the Spike (S) protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) of host actuates viral entry. Yet, how this binding interface evolves as virus acquires mutations during pandemic remains elusive. Here, using a high fidelity bioinformatics pipeline, we analysed 31,403 SARS-CoV-2 genomes across the globe, and identified 444 non-synonymous mutations that cause 49 distinct amino acid substitutions in the RBD. Molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested independent emergence of these RBD mutants during pandemic. In silico structure modelling of interfaces induced by mutations on residues which directly engage ACE2 or lie in the near vicinity revealed molecular rearrangements and binding energies unique to each RBD mutant. Comparative structure analysis using binding interface from mouse that prevents SARS-CoV-2 entry uncovered minimal molecular determinants in RBD necessary for the formation of stable interface. We identified that interfacial interaction involving amino acid residues N487 and G496 on either ends of the binding scaffold are indispensable to anchor RBD and are well conserved in all SARS-like corona viruses. All other interactions appear to be required to locally remodel binding interface with varying affinities and thus may decide extent of viral transmission and disease outcome. Together, our findings propose the modalities and variations in RBD-ACE2 interface formation exploited by SARS-CoV-2 for endurance.

ImportanceCOVID-19, so far the worst hit pandemic to mankind, started in January 2020 and is still prevailing globally. Our study identified key molecular arrangements in RBD-ACE2 interface that help virus to tolerate mutations and prevail. In addition, RBD mutations identified in this study can serve as a molecular directory for experimental biologists to perform functional validation experiments.

To investigate whether naturally occurring mutations in the spike protein are able to prevent antibody binding, yet while maintaining the ability to bind ACE2 and viral infectivity, mutations in the spike protein identified in cases of human infection were mapped to the crystallographically-determined interfaces between the spike protein and ACE2 (PDB entry 6M0J), antibody CC12.1 (PDB entry 6XC2), and antibody P2B-2F6 (PDB entry 7BWJ).

Both antibody binding interfaces partially overlap with the ACE2 binding interface. Among 16 mutations that map to the RBD:CC12.1 interface, 11 are likely to disrupt CC12.1 binding but not ACE2 binding. Among 12 mutations that map to the RBD:P2B-2F6 interface, 8 are likely to disrupt P2B-2F6 binding but not ACE2 binding. As expected, none of the mutations observed to date appear likely to disrupt the RBD:ACE2 interface.

We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 with mutated forms of the spike protein may retain the ability to bind ACE2 while evading recognition by antibodies that arise in response to the original wild-type form of the spike protein. It seems likely that immune evasion will be possible regardless of whether the spike protein was encountered in the form of infectious virus, or as the immunogen in a vaccine. Therefore, it also seems likely that reinfection with a variant strain of SARS-CoV-2 may occur among people who recover from Covid-19, and that vaccines with the ability to generate antibodies against multiple variant forms of the spike protein will be necessary to protect against variant forms of SARS-CoV-2 that are already circulating in the human population.",NA,329,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.13.422567v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.13.422567v1.full.pdf

One of the spotlights had been focused on the autophagy inhibitors as a target mechanism effective in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Consequently, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a derivative of CQ, was suggested as the first potentially be therapeutic strategies as they are known to be autophagy inhibitors.

Our data indicated that GNS561 showed the highest antiviral effect for two SARS-CoV-2 strains compared to CQ and remdesivir. Focusing on the autophagy mechanism, we showed that GNS561, located in LAMP2-positive lysosomes, together with SARS-CoV-2, blocked autophagy by increasing the size of LC3-II spots and the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm with the presence of multilamellar bodies characteristic of a complexed autophagy.

Currently, our knowledge of the mechanisms of COVID-19 disease pathogenesis is very limited which has hampered attempts to develop targeted antiviral strategies. Therefore, we urgently need an effective therapy for this unmet medical need. Viruses hijack and dysregulate cellular machineries in order for them to replicate and infect more cells. Thus, identifying and targeting dysregulated signaling pathways that have been taken over by viruses is one strategy for developing an effective antiviral therapy. We have developed a high-throughput drug screening system to identify potential antiviral drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2. We utilized a small molecule library of 430 protein kinase inhibitors, which are in various stages of clinical trials. Most of the tested kinase antagonists are ATP competitive inhibitors, a class of nucleoside analogs, which have been shown to have potent antiviral activity. From the primary screen, we have identified 34 compounds capable of inhibiting viral cytopathic effect in epithelial cells. Network of drug and protein relations showed that these compounds specifically targeted a limited number of cellular kinases. More importantly, we have identified mTOR-PI3K-AKT, ABL-BCR/MAPK, and DNA-Damage Response (DDR) pathways as key cellular signaling pathways critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subsequently, a secondary screen confirmed compounds such as Berzosertib (VE-822), Vistusertib (AZD2014), and Nilotinib with anti SARS-CoV-2 activity. Finally, we found that Berzosertib, an ATR kinase inhibitor in the DDR pathway, demonstrated potent antiviral activity in a human epithelial cell line and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hIPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. These inhibitors are already in clinical trials of phase 2 or 3 for cancer treatment, and can be repurposed as promising drug candidates for a host-directed therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, we have identified small molecule inhibitors exhibiting anti SARS-CoV-2 activity by blocking key cellular kinases, which gives insight on important mechanism of host-pathogen interaction. These compounds can be further evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 patients following additional in vivo safety and efficacy studies.

Both preparations had similar physicochemical and microbiological quality and showed ELISA immunoreactivity towards S1 protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD).

In our studies, we analysed 91 molecular features for 339 viral genes and 463 human genes that consisted of 677873 codon positions.

The envelope protein E, the membrane glycoprotein M and ORF7 could have been further benefited by a high rate of A/T in the third codon position. Thereby, the mistranslation or de-regulation of protein synthesis could produce collateral effects, as a consequence of viral occupancy of the host translation machinery due tomolecular similarities with viral genes. Furthermore, we provided a list of candidate human genes whose molecular features match those of SARS-CoV-2, SARSand MERS genes, which should be considered to be incorporated into genetic population studies to evaluate thesusceptibility to respiratory viral infections caused by these viruses.

Broad spectrum antiviral drugs have a particular advantage when dealing with rapid disease outbreaks, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Since viruses are completely dependent on internal cell mechanisms, they must cross cell membranes during their lifecycle, creating a dependence on processes involving membrane dynamics. Thus, in this study we examined whether the synthesis of glycosphingolipids, biologically active components of cell membranes, can serve as an antiviral therapeutic target. We examined the antiviral effect of two specific inhibitors of GlucosylCeramide synthase (GCS); (i) Genz-123346, an analogue of the FDA-approved drug Cerdelga(R), (ii) GENZ-667161, an analogue of venglustat which is currently under phase III clinical trials. We found that both GCS inhibitors inhibit the replication of four different enveloped RNA viruses of different genus, organ-target and transmission route: (i) Neuroinvasive Sindbis virus (SVNI), (ii) West Nile virus (WNV), (iii) Influenza A virus, and (iv) SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, GCS inhibitors significantly increase the survival rate of SVNI-infected mice. Our data suggest that GCS inhibitors can potentially serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy and should be further examined in preclinical and clinical trial. Analogues of the specific compounds tested have already been studied clinically, implying they can be fast-tracked for public use. With the current COVID-19 pandemic, this may be particularly relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Despite the benefits of mechanical ventilators, prolonged or misuse of these ventilators may lead to ventilation-associated/ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI). Damage caused to epithelial cells within the alveoli can lead to various types of complications and increased mortality rates. A key component of the immune response is recruitment of macrophages, immune cells that differentiate into phenotypes with unique pro- and/or anti-inflammatory roles based on the surrounding environment. An imbalance in pro- and anti-inflammatory responses can have deleterious effects on the individuals health. To gain a greater understanding of the mechanisms of the immune response to VILI and post-ventilation outcomes, we develop a mathematical model of interactions between the immune system and site of damage while accounting for macrophage polarization. Through Latin hypercube sampling we generate a virtual cohort of patients with biologically feasible dynamics.

Single-cell transcriptomics unveiled the cellular identities of airway and alveolar tissue and the differentiation of WNThi cycling alveolar stem cells, a human-specific lung cell type4. These synthetic human lung buds are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-dependent susceptibilities to infection, intercellular transmission and cytopathology in airway and alveolar tissue in individual lung buds. Interestingly, we detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies isolated from convalescent plasma that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and intercellular transmission.

Consequently, Spike protein pseudotyped vectors are a useful tool to study viral entry and its inhibition, with retroviral, lentiviral (LV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vectors the most commonly used systems. Methods to increase the titer of such vectors commonly include concentration by ultracentrifugation and truncation of the Spike protein cytoplasmic tail. However, limited studies have examined whether such a modification also impacts the proteins function. Here, we optimized concentration methods for SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotyped VSV vectors, finding that tangential flow filtration produced vectors with more consistent titers than ultracentrifugation. We also examined the impact of Spike tail truncation on transduction of various cell types and sensitivity to convalescent serum neutralization. We found that tail truncation increased Spike incorporation into both LV and VSV vectors and resulted in enhanced titers, but had no impact on sensitivity to convalescent serum inhibition. In addition, we analyzed the effect of the D614G mutation, which became a dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant early in the pandemic. Our studies revealed that, similar to the tail truncation, D614G independently increases Spike incorporation and vector titers, but that this effect is masked by also including the cytoplasmic tail truncation. Therefore, the use of full-length Spike protein, combined with tangential flow filtration, is recommended as a method to generate high titer pseudotyped vectors that retain native Spike protein functions.

IMPORTANCEPseudotyped viral vectors are useful tools to study the properties of viral fusion proteins, especially those from highly pathogenic viruses. The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been investigated using pseudotyped lentiviral and VSV vector systems, where truncation of its cytoplasmic tail is commonly used to enhance Spike incorporation into vectors and to increase the titers of the resulting vectors. However, our studies have shown that such effects can also mask the phenotype of the D614G mutation in the ectodomain of the protein, which was a dominant variant early in the COVID-19 pandemic. To better ensure the authenticity of Spike protein phenotypes when using pseudotyped vectors, we therefore recommend using full-length Spike proteins, combined with tangential flow filtration methods of concentration, if higher titer vectors are required.",NA,172,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.21.449352v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.21.449352v1.full.pdf

The paradigm is that a diverse enough repertoire of TCRs should always provide a proper, though rare, specificity for any given need. Expansion of such rare T cells would provide enough fighters for an efficacious immune response and enough antigen-experienced cells for memory3,4.

The Allen Institute for AI and collaborators announced the availability of a rapidly growing open dataset of publications, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). As the pace of research accelerates, biomedical scientists struggle to stay current. To expedite their investigations, scientists leverage hypothesis generation systems, which can automatically inspect published papers to discover novel implicit connections. We present an automated general purpose hypothesis generation systems AGATHA-C and AGATHA-GP for COVID-19 research. The systems are based on graph-mining and the transformer model. The systems are massively validated using retrospective information rediscovery and proactive analysis involving human-in-the-loop expert analysis. Both systems achieve high-quality predictions across domains (in some domains up to 0.97% ROC AUC) in fast computational time and are released to the broad scientific community to accelerate biomedical research. In addition, by performing the domain expert curated study, we show that the systems are able to discover on-going research findings such as the relationship between COVID-19 and oxytocin hormone.

Consequently, a large number of EM images of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 viruses with cells have been made available by numerous labs. However, due to EM recording techniques at high resolution, images of infection scenes are very noisy and they appear two dimensional ( flat). Current research consequently aims (A) at methods that can remove noise, and (B) at techniques that allow for recovering a 3D impression of the virus or its parts. Here we discuss a novel method which can recover a spatial impression of a whole infection scene at high resolution. In contrast to previous approaches which aim at the reconstruction of single spike proteins or a single virus, the here used method can be applied to a single noisy EM image of an infection scene. As one example image, we show a high resolution image of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in Vero cell cultures (Fig. 1). The method we use is based on probabilistic machine learning algorithms which can operate in a  zero-shot setting, i.e., in a setting when just one noisy image (and no large and clean image corpus) is available. The probabilistic method we apply can estimate non-noisy images by inferring first order statistics (pixel means) across image patches using a previously learned probabilistic image representation. Estimating higher order statistics and appropriately chosen probabilistic models then allow for the generation of images that enhance details and give a spatial impression of a full nanoscopic scene.",NA,133,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.25.432265v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.25.432265v1.full.pdf

While vaccine updates for current variants of concern (VOCs) are underway, it is likewise important to prepare for further antigenic mutations as the virus navigates the heterogeneous global landscape of host immunity. Toward this end, a wealth of data and tools exist that can augment existing genetic surveillance of VOC evolution. In this study, we integrate published datasets describing genetic, structural, and functional constraints on mutation along with computational analyses of antibody-spike co-crystal structures to identify a set of potential antigenic drift sites (PADS) within the receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Further, we project the PADS set into a continuous epitope-paratope space to facilitate interpretation of the degree to which newly observed mutations might be antigenically synergistic with existing VOC mutations, and this representation suggests that functionally convergent and synergistic antigenic mutations are accruing across VOC NTDs. The PADS set and synergy visualization serve as a reference as new mutations are detected on VOCs, enable proactive investigation of potentially synergistic mutations, and offer guidance to antibody and vaccine design efforts.

Nsp5 from several coronaviruses have also been found to cleave host proteins, disrupting molecular pathways involved in innate immunity. Nsp5 from the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus interacts with and can cleave human proteins, which may be relevant to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Based on the continuing global pandemic, and emerging understanding of coronavirus Nsp5-human protein interactions, we set out to predict what human proteins are cleaved by the coronavirus Nsp5 protease using a bioinformatics approach.

ResultsUsing a previously developed neural network trained on coronavirus Nsp5 cleavage sites (NetCorona), we made predictions of Nsp5 cleavage sites in all human proteins. Structures of human proteins in the Protein Data Bank containing a predicted Nsp5 cleavage site were then examined, generating a list of 92 human proteins with a highly predicted and accessible cleavage site. Of those, 48 are expected to be found in the same cellular compartment as Nsp5. Analysis of this targeted list of proteins revealed molecular pathways susceptible to Nsp5 cleavage and therefore relevant to coronavirus infection, including pathways involved in mRNA processing, cytokine response, cytoskeleton organization, and apoptosis.

ConclusionsThis study combines predictions of Nsp5 cleavage sites in human proteins with protein structure information and protein network analysis. We predicted cleavage sites in proteins recently shown to be cleaved in vitro by SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5, and we discuss how other potentially cleaved proteins may be relevant to coronavirus mediated immune dysregulation.

Currently, as dangerous mutations emerge there is an increased demand for specific treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The spike glycoprotein on the virus membrane binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on host cells through its receptor binding domain (RBD) to mediate virus entry. Thus, blocking this interaction may inhibit viral entry and consequently stop infection. Here, we generated fusion proteins composed of the extracellular portions of ACE2 and RBD fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 (ACE2-Ig and RBD-Ig, respectively). We demonstrate that ACE2-Ig is enzymatically active and that it can be recognized by the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, independently of its enzymatic activity. We further show that RBD-Ig efficiently inhibits in vitro and in vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection, better than ACE2-Ig. Mechanistically we show that anti-spike antibodies generation, ACE2 enzymatic activity and ACE2 surface expression were not affected by RBD-Ig. Finally, we show that RBD-Ig is more efficient than ACE2-Ig at neutralizing high virus concentration infection. We thus propose that RBD-Ig physically blocks virus infection by binding to ACE2 and that RBD-Ig should be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.

Author SummarySARS-CoV-2 infection caused serious socio-economic and health problems around the globe. As dangerous mutations emerge, there is an increased demand for specific treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. SARS-CoV-2 infection starts via binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) to its receptor, ACE2, on host cells. To intercept this binding, we generated Ig-fusion proteins. ACE2-Ig was generated to possibly block RBD by binding to it and RBD-Ig to block ACE2. We indeed showed that the fusion proteins bind to their respective target. We found that it is more efficient to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking ACE2 receptor with RBD-Ig. We also showed that RBD-Ig does not interfere with ACE2 activity or surface expression. Importantly, as our treatment does not target the virus directly, it may be efficient against any emerging variant. We propose here that RBD-Ig physically blocks virus infection by binding to ACE2 and thus it may be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.",NA,47,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.18.440302v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.18.440302v1.full.pdf

SARS-CoV-2 is thought to disable various features of host immunity and cellular defense. The SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) is known to inhibit host protein translation and could be a target for antiviral therapy against COVID-19. However, how SARS-CoV-2 circumvents this translational blockage for the production of its own proteins is an open question. Here, we report a bipartite mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 which operates by: (1) hijacking the host ribosome via direct interaction of its C-terminal domain (CT) with the 40S ribosomal subunit and (2) specifically lifting this inhibition for SARS-CoV-2 via a direct interaction of its N-terminal domain (NT) with the 5 untranslated region (5 UTR) of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA. We show that while Nsp1-CT is sufficient for binding to 40S and inhibition of host protein translation, the 5 UTR of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA removes this inhibition by binding to Nsp1-NT, suggesting that the Nsp1-NT-UTR interaction is incompatible with the Nsp1-CT-40S interaction. Indeed, lengthening the linker between Nsp1-NT and Nsp1-CT of Nsp1 progressively reduced the ability of SARS-CoV-2 5 UTR to escape the translational inhibition, supporting that the incompatibility is likely steric in nature. The short SL1 region of the 5 UTR is required for viral mRNA translation in the presence of Nsp1. Thus, our data provide a comprehensive view on how Nsp1 switches infected cells from host mRNA translation to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA translation, and that Nsp1 and 5 UTR may be targeted for anti-COVID-19 therapeutics.",NA,277,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.18.302901v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.18.302901v1.full.pdf

The cobas PCR Media transport medium developed by Roche facilitates high throughput analyses on cobas multianalyzer PCR platforms. There is no data on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA after freezing and thawing of clinical samples in this transport medium, but potential denaturing of the molecular template could impair test results. Our objective was to compare the quality and results of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing when performed on fresh or frozen samples in cobas PCR Media. Viral whole genome sequencing was performed using Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION platform. Genomic coverage and sequencing depth did not significantly differ between fresh and frozen samples (n=10). For samples with lower viral inoculum and PCR cycle threshold above 30, sequencing quality scores and detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms did not differ either. Freezing of cobas PCR Media does not negatively affect the quality of SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequencing results and it is therefore a suitable transport medium for outsourcing sequencing analyses to reference laboratories.

Obesity and diabetes are usually associated with dysregulated lipid synthesis and clearance which can initiate or aggravate pulmonary inflammation and injury. It has been shown that for viral entry into the host cell, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors present on the cells. We aimed to characterize how SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates lipid metabolism pathways in the host and the effect of dysregulated lipogenesis on the regulation of ACE2, specifically in obesity. In our study, through the re-analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data, we first found that lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed upregulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism, including the SOC3 gene which is involved in regulation of inflammation and inhibition of leptin signaling. This is of interest as viruses may hijack host lipid metabolism to allow completion of their viral replication cycles. Furthermore, a mouse model of diet-induced obesity showed a significant increase in Ace2 expression in the lungs which negatively correlated with the expression of genes that code for sterol response element binding proteins 1 and 2 (SREBP). Suppression of Srebp1 showed a significant increase in Ace2 expression in the lung.

There is a critical global need for therapeutic intervention strategies that can be deployed to safely treat COVID-19 disease and reduce associated morbidity and mortality. Increasing evidence shows that both natural and synthetic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), also referred to as Host Defense Proteins/Peptides (HDPs), can inhibit SARS-CoV-2, paving the way for the potential clinical use of these molecules as therapeutic options. In this manuscript, we describe the potent antiviral activity exerted by brilacidin--a de novo designed synthetic small molecule that captures the biological properties of HDPs--on SARS-CoV-2 in a human lung cell line (Calu-3) and a monkey cell line (Vero). These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in these cell culture models is primarily a result of the impact of brilacidin on viral entry and its disruption of viral integrity. Brilacidin has demonstrated synergistic antiviral activity when combined with remdesivir. Collectively, our data demonstrate that brilacidin exerts potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 and thus supports brilacidin as a promising COVID-19 drug candidate.

We analyzed the binding surface of ACE2 from several important animal species to begin to understand the parameters for the ACE2 recognition by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). We employed Shannon entropy analysis to determine the variability of ACE2 across its sequence and particularly in its RBD interacting region, and assessed differences between various species ACE2 and human ACE2. As cattle are a known reservoir for coronaviruses with previous human zoonotic transfer, and has a relatively divergent ACE2 sequence, we compared the binding kinetics of bovine and human ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. This revealed a nanomolar binding affinity for bovine ACE2 but an approximate ten-fold reduction of binding compared to human ACE2.

COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. Given the most optimistic projections estimating that it will take over a year to develop a vaccine, the best short-term strategy may lie in identifying virus-specific targets for small molecule interventions. All coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called -1 PRF to control the relative expression of their proteins. Prior analyses of SARS-CoV revealed that it employs a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of -1 PRF, and that it also harbors a -1 PRF attenuation element. Altering -1 PRF activity negatively impacts virus replication, suggesting that this molecular mechanism may be therapeutically targeted. Here we present a comparative analysis of the original SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals. Structural and functional analyses revealed that both elements promote similar rates of -1 PRF and that silent coding mutations in the slippery sites and in all three stems of the pseudoknot strongly ablated -1 PRF activity. The upstream attenuator hairpin activity has also been functionally retained. Small-angle x-ray scattering indicated that the pseudoknots in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 had the same conformation. Finally, a small molecule previously shown to bind the SARS-CoV pseudoknot and inhibit -1 PRF was similarly effective against -1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that such frameshift inhibitors may provide promising lead compounds to counter the current pandemic.",10.1074/jbc.ac120.013449,53,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.991083v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.991083v2.full.pdf

While these immunogens display the epitopes of potent neutralizing antibodies, they also present epitopes recognized by non or weakly neutralizing (""off-target"") antibodies. Using our recently developed electron microscopy epitope mapping approach, we have uncovered a phenomenon wherein off-target antibodies elicited by HIV trimer subunit vaccines cause the otherwise highly stabilized trimeric proteins to degrade into cognate protomers. Further, we show that these protomers expose an expanded suite of off-target epitopes, normally occluded inside the prefusion conformation of trimer, that subsequently elicit further off-target antibody responses.

While each omics data can be examined separately, jointly integrating multiple omics data allows for a deeper understanding and insights to be gained from the study. In particular data integration can be performed horizontally, where biological entities from multiple omics measurements are mapped to common reactions and pathways. However, data integration remains a challenge due to the complexity of the data and the difficulty in interpreting analysis results.

ResultsHere we present GraphOmics, a user-friendly platform to explore, integrate multiple omics datasets and support hypothesis generations. Users can upload transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics data to GraphOmics. Relevant entities are connected based on their biochemical relationships, and mapped to reactions and pathways from Reactome. From the Data Browser in GraphOmics, mapped entities and pathways can be ranked, sorted and filtered according to their statistical significance (p-values) and fold changes. Context-sensitive panels provide information on the currently selected entities, while interactive heatmaps and clustering functionalities are also available. As a case study, we demonstrated how GraphOmics was used to interactively explore multi-omics data and support hypothesis generations using two complex datasets from existing Zebrafish regeneration and Covid-19 human studies.

We also noted that convergent evolution has potentially occurred across several locations in the genome, showing selection pressures, including on the spike glycoprotein where we noted a potentially critical mutation that could affect its binding to the ACE2 receptor. We also report on mutations that could prevent current molecular diagnostics from detecting some of the sub-clades.

However, an unbiased understanding of the molecular processes across brain cell types that could contribute to these symptoms in COVID-19 patients is still missing. Here, we profile 47,678 droplet-based single-nucleus transcriptomes from the frontal cortex and choroid plexus across 10 non-viral, 4 COVID-19, and 1 influenza patient. We complement transcriptomic data with immunohistochemical staining for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. We find that all major cortex parenchymal and choroid plexus cell types are affected transcriptionally with COVID-19. This arises, in part, from SARS-CoV-2 infection of the cortical brain vasculature, meninges, and choroid plexus, stimulating increased inflammatory signaling into the brain. In parallel, peripheral immune cells infiltrate the brain, microglia activate programs mediating the phagocytosis of live neurons, and astrocytes dysregulate genes involved in neurotransmitter homeostasis. Among neurons, layer 2/3 excitatory neurons--evolutionarily expanded in humans4--show a specific downregulation of genes encoding major SNARE and synaptic vesicle components, predicting compromised synaptic transmission. These perturbations are not observed in terminal influenza. Many COVID-19 gene expression changes are shared with those in chronic brain disorders and reside in genetic variants associated with cognitive function, schizophrenia, and depression.

Here, we investigated genetic variations in a 414-583 amino acid region of the Spike protein, partially encompassing the ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), across a subset of 570 nasopharyngeal samples isolated between April 2020 and February 2021, from Washington, California, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota and Illinois. We found that samples isolated since November have an increased number of amino acid mutations in the region, with L452R being the dominant mutation. This mutation is associated with a recently discovered CAL.20C viral variant from clade 20C, lineage B.1.429, that since November-December 2020 is associated with multiple outbreaks and is undergoing massive expansion across California. In some samples, however, we found a distinct L452R-carrying variant of the virus that, upon detailed analysis of the GISAID database genomes, is also circulating primarily in California, but emerged even more recently.

The newly identified variant derives from the clade 20A (lineage B.1.232) and is named CAL.20A. We also found that the SARS-CoV-2 strain that caused the only recorded case of infection in an ape - gorillas in the San Diego Zoo, reported in January 2021 - is CAL.20A. In contrast to CAL.20C that carries two additional to L452R mutations in the Spike protein, L452R is the only mutation found in CAL.20A. According to the phylogenetic analysis, however, emergence of CAL.20C was also specifically triggered by acquisition of the L452R mutation. Further analysis of GISAID-deposited genomes revealed that several independent L452R-carrying lineages have recently emerged across the globe, with over 90% of the isolates reported between December 2020 - February 2021. Taken together, these results indicate that the L452R mutation alone is of significant adaptive value to SARS-CoV-2 and, apparently, the positive selection for this mutation became particularly strong only recently, possibly reflecting viral adaptation to the containment measures or increasing population immunity. While the functional impact of L452R has not yet been extensively evaluated, leucine-452 is positioned in the receptor-binding motif of RBD, in the interface of direct contact with the ACE2 receptor. Its replacement with arginine is predicted to result in both a much stronger binding to the receptor and escape from neutralizing antibodies. If true, this in turn might lead to significantly increased infectivity of the L452R variants, warranting their close surveillance and in-depth functional studies.",NA,51,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.22.432189v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.22.432189v2.full.pdf

We further evaluated the top 26 hits and determined their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, as well as other pathogenic RNA viruses. 20 of the 26 drugs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells (A549 epithelial cell line), with EC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 8 micromolar. We investigated the mechanism of action for these and found that masitinib, a drug originally developed as a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor for cancer treatment, strongly inhibited the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CLpro. X-ray crystallography revealed that masitinib directly binds to the active site of 3CLpro, thereby blocking its enzymatic activity. Mastinib also inhibited the related viral protease of picornaviruses and blocked picornaviruses replication. Thus, our results show that masitinib has broad anti-viral activity against two distinct beta-coronaviruses and multiple picornaviruses that cause human disease and is a strong candidate for clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.",NA,374,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.274639v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.274639v1.full.pdf

Although the capacity for recombination among betacoronaviruses is well documented, there is limited evidence of recombination between SARS-CoV-2 strains. By identifying the mutations that primarily determine SARS-CoV-2 clade structure, we developed a lightweight approach for detecting recombinant genomes. Among the over 537,000 genomes queried, we detect 1175 putative recombinants that contain multiple mutational markers from distinct clades. Additional phylogenetic analysis and the observed co-circulation of predicted parent clades in the geographic regions of exposure further support the feasibility of recombination in these detected cases. An analysis of these detected cases did not reveal any evidence for recombination hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Although most recombinant genotypes were detected a limited number of times, at least two recombinants are now widely transmitted. Recombinant genomes were also found to contain substitutions of concern for elevated transmissibility and lower vaccine efficacy, including D614G, N501Y, E484K, and L452R. Adjusting for an unequal probability of detecting recombinants derived from different parent clades, and for geographic variation in clade abundance, we estimate that at most 5% of circulating viruses in the USA and UK are recombinant.

In response to the growing threat of the COVID-19 pandemic in February, 2020, the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) began issuing Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) to laboratories and commercial manufacturers for the development and implementation of diagnostic tests1. So far, the gold standard assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection is the RT-qPCR (real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction) test2. However, the authorized RT-qPCR test protocols vary widely, not only in the reagents, controls, and instruments they use, but also in the SARS-CoV-2 genes they target, what results constitute a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection, and their limit of detection (LoD). The FDA has provided a web site that lists most of the tests that have been issued EUAs, along with links to the authorization letters and summary documents describing these tests1. However, it is very challenging to use this site to compare or replicate these tests for a variety of reasons. First, at least 12 of 18 tests for EUA submissions made prior to March 31, 2020, are not listed there. To our knowledge, no EUAs have been issued for these applications. Second, the data are not standardized and are only provided as longhand prose in the summary documents. Third, some details (e.g. primer sequences) are absent from several of the test descriptions. Fourth, for tests provided by commercial manufacturers, summary documents are completely missing. To address at least the first three issues, we have developed a database, EUAdb (EUAdb.org), that holds standardized information about EUA-issued tests and is focused on RT-qPCR diagnostic tests, or ""high complexity molecular-based laboratory developed tests""1. By providing a standardized ontology and curated data in a relational architecture, we seek to facilitate comparability and reproducibility, with the ultimate goal of consistent, universal and high-quality testing nationwide. Here, we document the basics of the EUAdb data architecture and simple data queries. The source files can be provided to anyone who wants to modify the database for his/her own research purposes.

These immunogens induced robust S-binding, ACE2-inhibition, and authentic and pseudovirus neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in mice. A Spike-ferritin nanoparticle (SpFN) vaccine elicited neutralizing titers more than 20-fold higher than convalescent donor serum, following a single immunization, while RBD-Ferritin nanoparticle (RFN) immunogens elicited similar responses after two immunizations. Passive transfer of IgG purified from SpFN- or RFN-immunized mice protected K18-hACE2 transgenic mice from a lethal SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge. Furthermore, SpFN- and RFN-immunization elicited ACE2 blocking activity and neutralizing ID50 antibody titers >2,000 against SARS-CoV-1, along with high magnitude neutralizing titers against major VoC.

Cancer patients are more prone to clinically evolve to more severe COVID-19 conditions, but the determinants of such a more severe outcome remain largely unknown. We have determined the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences of cancer patients and healthcare workers (HCW; non-cancer controls) by deep sequencing and investigated the within-host viral quasispecies of each infection, quantifying intrahost genetic diversity. Naso- and oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2+ swabs from 57 cancer patients and 14 healthcare workers (HCW) from the Brazilian Cancer Institute were collected in April-May 2020. Complete genome amplification using ARTIC network V3 multiplex primers was performed followed by next-generation sequencing. Assemblies were conducted in Geneious R11, where consensus sequences were extracted and intrahost single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) were identified. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis was performed using PhyMLv.3.0 and lineages were classified using Pangolin and CoV-GLUE. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all but one strain belonged to clade B1.1. Four genetically linked mutations known as the globally dominant SARS-CoV-2 haplotype (C241T, C3037T, C14408T and A23403G) were found in the majority of consensus sequences. SNV signatures of previously characterized Brazilian genomes were also observed in most samples. Another 85 SNVs were found at a lower frequency (1.4-19.7%). Cancer patients displayed a significantly higher intrahost viral genetic diversity compared to HCW (p = 0.009). Intrahost genetic diversity in cancer patients was independent of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values, and was not associated with disease severity, use of corticosteroids, or use of antivirals, characteristics that could influence viral diversity. Such a feature may explain, at least in part, the more adverse outcomes to which cancer/COVID-19 patients experience.

Author SummaryCancer patients are more prone to clinically evolve to more severe COVID-19 conditions, but the determinants of such a more severe outcome remain largely unknown. In this study, phylogenetic and variation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from cancer patients and non-cancer healthcare workers at the Brazilian National Cancer Institute were characterized by deep sequencing. Viral genomes showed signatures characteristic of Brazilian viruses, consistent with the hypothesis of local, community transmission rather than virus importation from abroad. Despite most genomes in patients and healthcare workers belonging to the same lineage, intrahost variability was higher in cancer patients when compared to non-cancer counterparts. The intrahost genomic diversity analysis presented in our study highlights the relaxed evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a vulnerable population of cancer patients.

Demonstrated in crystal structures, the residues 452 and 484 in RBD are not in direct contact with interfacial residues in the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This suggests that albeit there are some possibly nonlocal effects, the E484Q and L452R mutations might not significantly affect RBDs binding with ACE2, which is an important step for viral entry into host cells. Thus, without the known molecular mechanism, these two successful mutations (from the point of view of SARS-CoV-2) can be hypothesized to evade human antibodies. Using in silico all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation as well as deep learning (DL) approaches, here we show that these two mutations significantly reduce the binding affinity between RBD and the antibody LY-CoV555 (also named as Bamlanivimab) that was proven to be efficacious for neutralizing the wide-type SARS-CoV-2. With the revealed molecular mechanism on how L452R and E484K evade LY-CoV555, we expect that more specific therapeutic antibodies can be accordingly designed and/or a precision mixing of antibodies can be achieved in a cocktail treatment for patients infected with the variant B.1.617.

Therefore, well characterized recombinant RBDs are essential. We have performed an in-depth structural and functional characterization of RBDs expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. To structurally characterize the native RBDs (comprising N- and O-glycans and additional posttranslational modifications) a multilevel mass spectrometric approach was employed. Released glycan and glycopeptide analysis were integrated with intact mass analysis, glycan-enzymatic dissection and top-down sequencing for comprehensive annotation of RBD proteoforms. The data showed distinct glycosylation for CHO- and HEK293-RBD with the latter exhibiting antenna fucosylation, higher level of sialylation and a combination of core 1 and core 2 type O-glycans. Additionally, from both putative O-glycosylation sites, we could confirm that O-glycosylation was exclusively present at T323, which was previously unknown. For both RBDs, the binding to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of positive patients and affinity to ACE2 receptor was addressed showing comparable results.

No such inflammatory response was observed in response to membrane (M), envelope (E), and neucleocapsid (N) proteins.

Further, such an activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway is abrogated in Tlr2-deficient macrophages. Consistently, administration of S protein induces IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-1 {beta} in wild-type, but not Tlr2-deficient mice.

To demonstrate the validity of our approach, we conduct an extensive comparative genomic analysis of more than 20,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Our classification system delineates 12 clusters and 4 super-clusters in SARS-CoV-2, with a highly biased spatio-temporal distribution worldwide, and provides important observations concerning the evolutionary processes associated with the emergence of novel viral types. Based on the estimates of SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate and genetic distances of genomes of the early pandemic phase, we infer that SARS-CoV-2 could have been circulating in humans since August-November 2019. The observed pattern of genomic variability is remarkably similar between all clusters and super-clusters, being UTRs and the s2m element, a highly conserved secondary structure element, the most variable genomic regions. While several polymorphic sites that are specific to one or more clusters were predicted to be under positive or negative selection, overall, our analyses also suggest that the emergence of novel genome types is unlikely to be driven by widespread convergent evolution and independent fixation of advantageous substitutions. While, in the absence of rigorous experimental validation, several questions concerning the evolutionary processes and the phenotypic characteristics (increased/decreased virulence) remain open, we believe that the approach outlined in this study can be of relevance for the tracking and functional characterization of different types of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.",NA,156,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.172924v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.172924v2.full.pdf

With most viral infections, the presence of specific serum antibodies has provided a reliable biomarker for the exposure to the virus of interest. SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, does not reliably induce a durable antibody response, especially in sub-clinically infected individuals. Consequently, it is plausible for a recently infected individual to yield a false negative result within only a few months after exposure. Immunodiagnostic attention has therefore shifted to studies of specific T cell memory to SARS-CoV-2. Most reports published so far agree that a T cell response is engaged during SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they also state that in 20-81% of non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals, T cells respond to SARS-CoV-2 antigens (mega peptide pools), allegedly due to T cell cross-reactivity with coronaviruses causing Common Cold (CCC), or other antigens. Here we show that by introducing irrelevant mega peptide pools as negative controls to account for chance cross-reactivity, and by establishing the antigen dose-response characteristic of the T cells, one can clearly discern between cognate T cell memory induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection vs. cross-reactive T cell responses in individuals who had not been infected with SARS-CoV-2.",NA,284,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.29.402677v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.29.402677v1.full.pdf

Understanding the interaction mechanism of viral and host proteins involved in different signaling pathways may help decipher the attacking mechanism on the signal transmission during diseases, followed by discovering appropriate therapeutic solutions.

The expression of any viral gene depends mostly on the host translational machinery. Recent studies report the great significance of codon usage biases in establishing host-viral protein-protein interactions (PPI). Exploiting the codon usage patterns between a pair of co-evolved host and viral proteins may present novel insight into the host-viral protein interactomes during disease pathogenesis. Leveraging the codon usage pattern similarity (and dissimilarity), we propose a computational scheme to recreate the hostviral protein interaction network (HVPPI). We use seventeen (17) essential signaling pathways for our current work and study the possible targeting mechanism of SARS-CoV2 viral proteins on such pathway proteins. We infer both negatively and positively interacting edges in the network. We can find a relationship where one host protein may target by more than one viral protein.

Extensive analysis performed to understand the network topologically and the attacking behavior of the viral proteins. Our study reveals that viral proteins, mostly utilize codons, rare in the targeted host proteins (negatively correlated interaction). Among non-structural proteins, NSP3 and structural protein, Spike (S) protein, are the most influential proteins in interacting multiple host proteins. In ranking the most affected pathways, MAPK pathways observe to be worst affected during the COVID-19 disease.

Further exploration via CoPIC led to the discovery of extensive ternary complexes composed of these components, which infer potential higher-order complexes.

Using in silico analyses (machine learning techniques and comparative genomics), several features associated to coronavirus pathogenicity have been recently proposed, including a potential increase in the strength of a predicted novel nuclear export signal (NES) motif in the nucleocapsid protein.

Here, we have used a well-established nuclear export assay to experimentally establish whether the recently proposed nucleocapsid NESs are capable of mediating nuclear export, and to evaluate if their activity correlates with coronavirus pathogenicity.

The six NES motifs tested were functional in our assay, but displayed wide differences in export activity. Importantly, these differences in NES strength were not related to strain pathogenicity. Rather, we found that the NESs of the strains belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus were markedly stronger than the NESs of the strains belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus.

We conclude that, while some of the genomic features recently identified in silico could be crucial contributors to coronavirus pathogenicity, this does not appear to be the case of nucleocapsid NES activity, as it is more closely related to coronavirus genus than to pathogenic capacity.",NA,302,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.06.328138v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.06.328138v1.full.pdf

To decipher any correlation between SARS-CoV-2 evolution and its epidemiology in India, we studied the mutational diversity of spike glycoprotein, the key player for the attachment, fusion and entry of virus to the host cell. For this, we analyzed the sequences of 630 Indian isolates as available in GISAID database till June 07, 2020, and detected the spike protein variants to emerge from two major ancestors - Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 and its D614G variant. Average stability of the docked spike protein - host receptor (S-R) complexes for these variants correlated strongly (R2=0.96) with the fatality rates across Indian states. However, while more than half of the variants were found unique to India, 67% of all variants showed lower stability of S-R complex than the respective ancestral variants, indicating a possible fitness loss in recently emerged variants, despite a continuous increase in mutation rate. These results conform to the sharply declining fatality rate countrywide (>7-fold during April 11 - June 28, 2020). Altogether, while we propose the potential of S-R complex stability to track disease severity, we urge an immediate need to explore if SARS-CoV-2 is approaching mutational meltdown in India.

Author summaryEpidemiological features are intricately linked to evolutionary diversity of rapidly evolving pathogens, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. Our work suggests the potential of average stability of complexes formed by the circulating spike mutational variants and the human host receptor to track the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a given region. In India, the stability of these complexes for recent variants tend to decrease relative to their ancestral ones, following countrywide declining fatality rate, in contrast to an increasing mutation rate. We hypothesize such a scenario as nascent footprints of Mullers ratchet, proposing large-scale population genomics study for its validation, since this understanding could lead to therapeutic approaches for facilitating mutational meltdown of SARS-CoV-2, as experienced earlier for influenza A virus.",NA,83,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255570v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255570v2.full.pdf

Enriched magnetic nanoparticles were then detected by means of frequency magnetic mixing detection technology, using a portable magnetic read-out device. Measuring signals corresponded to the amount of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in the sample.

During transmission, host cell invasion is controlled by a large-scale conformational change of the Spike protein. This conformational rearrangement leads to membrane fusion, which creates transmembrane pores through which the viral genome is passed to the host. During Spike-protein-mediated fusion, the fusion peptides must be released from the core of the protein and associate with the host membrane. Interestingly, the Spike protein possesses many post-translational modifications, in the form of branched glycans that flank the surface of the assembly. Despite the large number of glycosylation sites, until now, the specific role of glycans during cell invasion has been unclear. Here, we propose that glycosylation is needed to provide sufficient time for the fusion peptides to reach the host membrane, otherwise the viral particle would fail to enter the host. To understand this process, an all-atom model with simplified energetics was used to perform thousands of simulations in which the protein transitions between the prefusion and postfusion conformations. These simulations indicate that the steric composition of the glycans induces a pause during the Spike protein conformational change. We additionally show that this glycan-induced delay provides a critical opportunity for the fusion peptides to capture the host cell. This previously-unrecognized role of glycans reveals how the glycosylation state can regulate infectivity of this pervasive pathogen.",NA,202,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.18.427189v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.18.427189v1.full.pdf

The SARS-CoV-2 FRNA provides a quantitative assessment of a large number of infected cells through use of a high-content imaging system. Because of this approach, and the fact that it does not involve subjective interpretation, this assay is more efficient and more accurate than other neutralization assays. In addition, the ability to set robust acceptance criteria for individual plates and specific test wells provided further rigor to this assay. Such agile adaptability avails use with multiple virus variants.

Here, we study proteolytic cleavage of viral and cellular proteins in two cell line models of SARS-CoV-2 replication using mass spectrometry to identify protein neo-N-termini generated through protease activity. We identify previously unknown cleavage sites in multiple viral proteins, including major antigenic proteins S and N, which are the main targets for vaccine and antibody testing efforts. We discovered significant increases in cellular cleavage events consistent with cleavage by SARS-CoV-2 main protease, and identify 14 potential high-confidence substrates of the main and papain-like proteases, validating a subset with in vitro assays. We showed that siRNA depletion of these cellular proteins inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, and that drugs targeting two of these proteins: the tyrosine kinase SRC and Ser/Thr kinase MYLK, showed a dose-dependent reduction in SARS-CoV-2 titres.

Evolutionary dynamics, gene-specific phylogeny and emergence of the novel co-evolving mutations in nine structural and non-structural genes among circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains in ten states of India have been assessed.

Materials and methods46 SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences submitted from India were downloaded from the GISAID (39/46) or from NCBI (7/46) database. Phylogenetic study and analyses of mutation were based on the nine structural and non-structural genes of SARS-CoV-2 strains. Secondary structure of RdRP/NSP12 protein was predicted with respect to the novel A97V mutation.

ResultsPhylogenetic analyses revealed the evolution of ""genome-type clusters"" and adaptive selection of ""L"" type SARS-CoV-2 strains with genetic closeness to the bat SARS-like coronaviruses than pangolin or MERS-CoVs. With regards to the novel co-evolving mutations, 2 groups are seen to circulate in India at present: the ""major group"" (52.2%) and the ""minor group"" (30.4%), harboring four and five co-existing mutations, respectively. The ""major group"" mutations fall in the A2a clade. All the minor group mutations, except 11083G>T (L37F, NSP6) were unique to the Indian isolates.

The neutralizing activity of vaccine-elicited antibodies is even more focused on the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) than for infection-elicited antibodies. However, within the RBD, binding of vaccine-elicited antibodies is more broadly distributed across epitopes than for infection-elicited antibodies. This greater binding breadth means single RBD mutations have less impact on neutralization by vaccine sera than convalescent sera.

Despite the evidence about SARS-CoV-2 infecting the human gut, little is known about the importance of the enteric phase of SARS-CoV-2 for the viral lifecycle and for the development of COVID-19-associated pathologies. Similarly, it remains unknown whether the innate immune response triggered in this organ to combat viral infection is similar or distinct compared to the one triggered in other organs.

DesignWe exploited human ileum- and colon-derived organoids as a non-transformed culture model supporting SARS-CoV-2 infection. We characterized the replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in intestinal epithelial cells and correlated the expression of the viral receptor ACE2 with infection. We performed conventional and targeted single-cell transcriptomics and multiplex single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and used IFN-reporter bioassays to characterize the response of primary human intestinal epithelial cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsWe identified a subpopulation of enterocytes as the prime target of SARS-CoV-2. We found the lack of positive correlation between susceptibility to infection and the expression of ACE2 and revealed that SARS-CoV-2 downregulates ACE2 expression upon infection. Infected cells activated strong proinflammatory programs and produced interferon, while expression of interferon-stimulated genes was limited to bystander cells due to SARS-CoV-2 suppressing the autocrine action of interferon in infected cells.

ConclusionOur findings reveal that SARS-CoV-2 curtails the immune response in primary human intestinal epithelial cells to promote its replication and spread and this highlights the gut as a proinflammatory reservoir that should be considered to fully understand SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future? O_LIThe absence of correlation between ACE2 levels and susceptibility suggest that medications influencing ACE2 levels (e.g. high blood pressure drugs) will not make patients more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
C_LIO_LIThe restricted cell tropism and the distinct immune response mounted by the GI tract, suggests that specific cellular restriction/replication factors and organ specific intrinsic innate immune pathways can represent unique therapeutic targets to treat COVD-19 patients by considering which organ is most infected/impacted by SARS-CoV-2.

There is a need, however, for a flexible, platform agnostic, method that can provide multiple throughput options depending on changing requirements as the pandemic peaks and troughs. Here we present CoronaHiT, a method capable of multiplexing up to 96 small genomes on a single MinION flowcell or >384 genomes on Illumina NextSeq, using transposase mediated addition of adapters and PCR based addition of barcodes to ARTIC PCR products. We demonstrate the method by sequencing 95 and 59 SARS-CoV-2 genomes for routine and rapid outbreak response runs, respectively, on Nanopore and Illumina platforms and compare to the standard ARTIC LoCost nanopore method.

In conclusion, we demonstrate that CoronaHiT can multiplex up to 96 SARS-CoV-2 genomes per MinION flowcell and that Illumina sequencing can be performed on the same libraries, which will allow significantly higher throughput.

Despite these massive cellular profiling efforts, many studies have focused on defining myeloid dysfunction in specific diseases without identifying common pan-disease trends in the mononuclear phagocyte compartment within the lung.

The pathogen SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the lower respiratory tract and causes fatal pneumonia. Although tremendous efforts have been put into investigating the pathogeny of SARS-CoV-2, the underlying mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with its host is largely unexplored. Here, by comparing the genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and human, we identified five fully conserved elements in SARS-CoV-2 genome, which were termed as ""human identical sequences (HIS)"". HIS are also recognized in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV genome. Meanwhile, HIS-SARS-CoV-2 are highly conserved in the primate. Mechanically, HIS-SARS-CoV-2, behaving as virus-derived miRNAs, directly target to the human genomic loci and further interact with host enhancers to activate the expression of adjacent and distant genes, including cytokines gene and angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), a well-known cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2), which further increases hyaluronan formation. Noteworthily, hyaluronan level in plasma of COVID-19 patients is tightly correlated with severity and high risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and may act as a predictor for the progression of COVID-19. HIS antagomirs, which downregulate hyaluronan level effectively, and 4-Methylumbelliferone (MU), an inhibitor of hyaluronan synthesis, are potential drugs to relieve the ARDS related ground-glass pattern in lung for COVID-19 treatment. Our results revealed that unprecedented HIS elements of SARS-CoV-2 contribute to the cytokine storm and ARDS in COVID-19 patients.

We find PF-00835231 with at least similar or higher potency than remdesivir or GC-376. A time-of-drug-addition approach delineates the timing of early SARS-CoV-2 life cycle steps in A549+ACE2 cells and validates PF-00835231s early time of action. In a model of the human polarized airway epithelium, both PF-00835231 and remdesivir potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations. Finally, we show that the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein, which was previously suggested to diminish PF-00835231s efficacy based on experiments in monkey kidney Vero E6 cells, does not negatively impact PF-00835231 efficacy in either A549+ACE2 cells or human polarized airway epithelial cultures. Thus, our study provides in vitro evidence for the potential of PF-00835231 as an effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral and addresses concerns that emerged based on prior studies in non-human in vitro models.

ImportanceThe arsenal of SARS-CoV-2 specific antiviral drugs is extremely limited. Only one direct-acting antiviral drug is currently approved, the viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, and it has limited efficacy. Thus, there is a substantial need to develop additional antiviral compounds with minimal side effects and alternate viral targets. One such alternate target is its main protease, 3CLpro (Mpro), an essential component of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle processing the viral polyprotein into the components of the viral polymerase complex. In this study, we characterize a novel antiviral drug, PF-00835231, which is the active component of the first-in-class 3CLpro-targeting regimen in clinical trials. Using 3D in vitro models of the human airway epithelium, we demonstrate the antiviral potential of PF-00835231 for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.",NA,19,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.28.272880v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.28.272880v2.full.pdf

We determined whether nervus terminalis neurons and their peripheral and central projections may provide an alternative route from the nose to the brain. Nervus terminalis neurons were double-labeled with antibodies against ACE2 and nervus terminalis markers in postnatal mice.

We now have extended our in vivo studies of STI-2020 to include disease treatment efficacy, profiling of biodistribution of STI-2020 in mice when antibody is delivered intranasally (IN) or intravenously (IV), as well as pharmacokinetics in mice following IN antibody administration. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters were treated with STI-2020 using these routes, and treatment effects on severity and duration of COVID-19-like disease in this model were evaluated. In SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters, treatment with STI-2020 12 hours post-infection using the IN route led to a decrease in severity of clinical disease signs and a more robust recovery during 9 days of infection as compared to animals treated with an isotype control antibody.

We introduce a target capture next-generation sequencing methodology, the ONETest Coronaviruses Plus, to sequence SARS-CoV-2 genomes and select genes of other respiratory viruses simultaneously.

MethodsWe applied the ONETest on 70 respiratory samples (collected in Florida, USA between May and July, 2020), in which SARS-CoV-2 had been detected by a qualitative PCR assay. For 48 (69%) of the samples, we also applied the ARTIC protocol for Illumina sequencing. All the libraries were sequenced as 2x150 nucleotide reads on an Illumina instrument. The ONETest data were analyzed using an in-house pipeline and the ARTIC data using a published pipeline to produce consensus SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, to which lineages were assigned using pangolin.

ResultsOf the 70 ONETest libraries, 45 (64%) had a complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence (> 29,000 bases and with > 90% of its bases covered by at least 10 reads). Of the 48 ARTIC libraries, 25 (52%) had a complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence.

In 24 out of 34 (71%) samples in which both the ONETest and ARTIC sequences were complete or near-complete and in which lineage could be assigned to both the ONETest and ARTIC sequences, the SARS-CoV-2 lineage identified was the same.

ConclusionsThe ONETest can be used to sequence the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in archived samples and thereby enable detection of circulating and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Target capture approaches, such as the ONETest, are less prone to loss of sequence coverage probably due to amplicon dropouts encountered in amplicon approaches, such as ARTIC. With its added value of characterizing other major respiratory pathogens, although not assessed in this study, the ONETest can help to better understand the epidemiology of infectious respiratory disease in the post COVID-19 era.",NA,188,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.25.437083v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.25.437083v1.full.pdf

Although SARS-CoV-2 propagates efficiently in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, antivirals such as nucleos(t)ide analogs (nucs) often exhibit decreased activity in these cells due to inefficient metabolization. Limited SARS-CoV-2 replication and propagation occurs in human cells, which are the most relevant testing platforms. By performing serial passages of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate in the human hepatoma cell line clone Huh7.5, we selected viral populations with improved viability in human cells. Culture adaptation led to the emergence of a significant number of high frequency changes (>90% of the viral population) in the region coding for the spike glycoprotein, including a deletion of nine amino acids in the N-terminal domain and 3 amino acid changes (E484D, P812R, and Q954H). We demonstrated that the Huh7.5-adapted virus exhibited a >3-Log10 increase in infectivity titers (TCID50) in Huh7.5 cells, with titers of ~8 Log10TCID50/mL, and >2-Log10 increase in the human lung cancer cell line Calu-1, with titers of ~6 Log10TCID50/mL. Culture adaptation in Huh7.5 cells further permitted efficient infection of the otherwise SARS-CoV-2 refractory human lung cancer cell line A549, with titers of ~6 Log10TCID50/mL. The enhanced ability of the virus to replicate and propagate in human cells permitted screening of a panel of nine nucs, including broad-spectrum compounds. Remdesivir, EIDD-2801 and to a limited extent galidesivir showed antiviral effect across these human cell lines, whereas sofosbuvir, uprifosbuvir, valopicitabine, mericitabine, ribavirin, and favipiravir had no apparent activity.

ImportanceThe cell culture adapted variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained in the present study, showed significantly enhanced replication and propagation in various human cell lines, including lung derived cells otherwise refractory for infection with the original virus. This SARS-CoV-2 variant will be a valuable tool permitting investigations across human cell types, and studies of identified mutations could contribute to our understanding of viral pathogenesis. In particular, the adapted virus can be a good model for investigations of viral entry and cell tropism for SARS-CoV-2, in which the spike glycoprotein plays a central role. Further, as shown here with the use of remdesivir and EIDD-2801, two nucs with significant inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2, large differences in the antiviral activity are observed depending on the cell line.

However, because the viral phylogeny is already so large - and will undoubtedly grow many fold - placing new sequences onto the tree has emerged as a barrier to real-time genomic contact tracing. Here, we resolve this challenge by building an efficient, tree-based data structure encoding the inferred evolutionary history of the virus. We demonstrate that our approach improves the speed of phylogenetic placement of new samples and data visualization by orders of magnitude, making it possible to complete the placements under real-time constraints. Our method also provides the key ingredient for maintaining a fully-updated reference phylogeny.

Here we analyzed the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other single-strand RNA (ssRNA) viruses for the presence of a unique cis RNA element called SECReTE. This motif consists of 10 or more consecutive triplet nucleotide repeats where a pyrimidine nucleotide (C or U) in present every third base, and which we identified in mRNAs encoding secreted proteins in bacteria, yeast, and humans. This motif facilitates mRNA localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), along with the enhanced translation and secretion of translated protein. We now examined for SECReTE presence in Group IV and V RNA viruses, the former including the Coronaviridae, like SARS-CoV-2 and other positive (+)ssRNA viruses, and the latter consisting of negative (-) ssRNA viruses. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains 40 SECReTE motifs at an abundance of ~1.3 SECReTEs/kilobase (kb). Moreover, all ssRNA viruses we examined contain multiple copies of this motif and appears in (+)ssRNA viruses as non-random in occurrence and independent of genome length. Importantly, (+)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Coronaviruses and Hepaciviruses), which utilize ER membranes to create double membrane vesicles to serve as viral replication centers (VRCs), contain more SECReTE motifs per kb as compared to (-)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Rabies, Mumps, and Influenza), that replicate in the nucleus or the cytoplasm, or other (+)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Enteroviruses and Flaviviruses) which employ different organellar membranes. As predicted by our earlier work, SECReTE sequences are mostly found in membranal or ER-associated/secreted proteins. Thus, we propose that SECReTE motifs could be important for the efficient translation and secretion of secreted viral proteins, as well as for VRC formation. Future studies of SECReTE function and identification of SECReTE-binding proteins could provide new drug targets to treat COVID-19 and other (+)ssRNA related diseases.",NA,214,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.050088v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.050088v1.full.pdf

A consequence of poor wastewater management is the discharge of untreated wastewater carrying infectious SARS-CoV-2 into natural water systems that are home to marine mammals. Here, we predict the susceptibility of marine mammal species using a modelling approach. We identified that many species of whale, dolphin and seal, as well as otters, are predicted to be highly susceptible to infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In addition, geo-mapping highlights how current wastewater management in Alaska may lead to susceptible marine mammal populations being exposed to the virus. Localities such as Cold Bay, Naknek, Dillingham and Palmer may require additional treatment of their wastewater to prevent virus spillover through sewage. Since over half of these susceptibility species are already at risk worldwide, the release of the virus via untreated wastewater could have devastating consequences for their already declining populations. For these reasons, we discuss approaches that can be taken by the public, policymakers and wastewater treatment facilities to reduce the risk of virus spillover in our natural water systems.

The relationships between innate cellular responses in ARDS resulting from COVID-19 compared to other causes of ARDS, such as bacterial sepsis is unclear. Moreover, the beneficial effects of dexamethasone therapy during severe COVID-19 remain speculative but understanding the mechanistic effects could improve evidence-based therapeutic interventions. To interrogate these relationships, we developed an scRNAseq atlas that is freely accessible (https://www.biernaskielab.ca/COVID_neutrophil). We discovered that compared to bacterial ARDS, COVID-19 was associated with distinct neutrophil polarization characterized by either interferon (IFN) or prostaglandin (PG) active states. Neutrophils from bacterial ARDS had higher expression of antibacterial molecules such as PLAC8 and CD83. Dexamethasone therapy in COVID patients rapidly altered the IFNactive state, downregulated interferon responsive genes, and activated the IL1R2+ve neutrophils. Dexamethasone also induced the emergence of immature neutrophils expressing immunosuppressive molecules ARG1 and ANXA1, which were not present in healthy controls. Moreover, dexamethasone remodeled global cellular interactions by changing neutrophils from information receivers into information providers. Importantly, male patients had higher proportions of IFNactive neutrophils and a greater degree of steroid-induced immature neutrophil expansion. Indeed, the highest proportion of IFNactive neutrophils was associated with mortality. These results define neutrophil states unique to COVID-19 when contextualized to other life-threatening infections, thereby enhancing the relevance of our findings at the bedside.

The cellular host factors and pathways co-opted by SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in the execution of their life cycles remain ill-defined. To develop an extensive compendium of host factors required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E), we performed parallel genome-scale CRISPR knockout screens. These screens uncovered multiple host factors and pathways with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles, including major dependency on glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, SREBP signaling, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis, as well as an unexpected requirement for several poorly characterized proteins. We identified an absolute requirement for the VTT-domain containing protein TMEM41B for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and all other coronaviruses. This human Coronaviridae host factor compendium represents a rich resource to develop new therapeutic strategies for acute COVID-19 and potential future coronavirus spillover events.

Considering the worldwide emergency status due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, effective pan-coronavirus antiviral drugs are required to tackle the ongoing as well as future (re)emerging virus outbreaks. Protein kinase CK2 has been deemed a promising therapeutic target in COVID-19 supported by its in vitro pharmacologic inhibition and molecular studies on SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. CIGB-325 is a first-in-class synthetic peptide impairing the CK2-mediated signaling whose safety and clinical benefit have been evidenced in Covid-19 and cancer patients after intravenous administration. Here, we explored the putative antiviral effect of CIGB-325 over MDBK cells infected by bovine coronavirus (BCoV) Mebus. Importantly, CIGB-325 inhibited both the cytopathic effect and the number of plaques forming units with a half-inhibitory concentrations IC50 = 3.5 M and 17.7 M, respectively. Accordingly, viral protein accumulation at the cytoplasm was clearly reduced by treating BCoV-infected cells with CIGB-325 over time, as determined by immunocytochemistry. Of note, data from pull-down assay followed by western blot and/or mass spectrometry identification revealed physical interaction of CIGB-325 with nucleocapsid (N) protein and a bona fide cellular CK2 substrates. Functional enrichment and network analysis from the CIGB-325 interacting proteins indicated cytoskeleton reorganization and protein folding as the most represented biological processes disturbed by this anti-CK2 peptide. Altogether, our findings not only unveil the direct antiviral activity of CIGB-325 on coronavirus infection but also provide molecular clues underlying such effect.

Even though population sizes are integrated out and not explicitly sampled through MCMC, we are still able to generate samples from the population size posteriors, which allows demographic reconstruction through time.

The virus concentration is considered as a continuous variable and virus movement is modelled by diffusion, while changes in the states of cells (i.e. healthy, infected, dead) are represented by a stochastic agent-based model. The two subsystems are intertwined: the probability of an agent getting infected in the ABM depends on the local viral concentration, and the source term of viral production in the PDE is determined by the cells that are infected.

We develop a computational tool that allows us to study the hybrid system and the generated spatial patterns in detail. We systematically compare the outputs with a classical ODE system of viral dynamics, and find that the ODE model is a good approximation only if the diffusion coefficient is large.

Viruses can also spread through fusion of infected with uninfected cells. We compared the requirements of ACE2 expression, proteolytic activation, and the sensitivity to inhibitors for SARS2-S-mediated and SARS-CoV-S(SARS1-S)-mediated cell-cell fusion. SARS2-S-driven fusion was moderately increased by TMPRSS2 and strongly by ACE2, while SARS1-S-driven fusion was strongly increased by TMPRSS2 and less so by ACE2 expression. In contrast to SARS1-S, SARS2-S-mediated cell-cell fusion was efficiently activated by Batimastat-sensitive metalloproteases. Mutation of the S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site reduced effector-target-cell fusion when ACE2 or TMPRSS2 were limiting and rendered SARS2-S-driven cell-cell fusion more dependent on TMPRSS2. When both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were abundant, initial target-effector-cell fusion was unaltered compared to wt SARS2-S, but syncytia remained smaller. Mutation of the S2 site specifically abrogated activation by TMPRSS2 for both cell-cell fusion and SARS2-S-driven pseudoparticle entry but still allowed for activation by metalloproteases for cell-cell fusion and by cathepsins for particle entry. Finally, we found that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor Bromhexine was unable to reduce TMPRSS2-activated cell-cell fusion by SARS1-S and SARS2-S as opposed to the inhibitor Camostat. Paradoxically, Bromhexine enhanced cell-cell fusion in the presence of TMPRSS2, while its metabolite Ambroxol exhibited inhibitory activity in some conditions. On Calu-3 lung cells, Ambroxol weakly inhibited SARS2-S-driven lentiviral pseudoparticle entry, and both substances exhibited a dose-dependent trend towards weak inhibition of authentic SARS-CoV-2.

IMPORTANCECell-cell fusion allows the virus to infect neighboring cells without the need to produce free virus and contributes to tissue damage by creating virus-infected syncytia. Our results demonstrate that the S2 cleavage site is essential for activation by TMPRSS2 and unravel important differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, among those greater dependence of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2 expression and activation by metalloproteases for cell-cell fusion. Bromhexine, reportedly an inhibitor of TMPRSS2, is currently tested in clinical trials against coronavirus disease 2019. Our results indicate that Bromhexine enhances fusion in some conditions. We therefore caution against use of Bromhexine in higher dosage until its effects on SARS-CoV-2 spike activation are better understood. The related compound Ambroxol, which similarly to Bromhexine is clinically used as an expectorant, did not exhibit activating effects on cell-cell fusion. Both compounds exhibited weak inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection at high concentrations, which might be clinically attainable for Ambroxol.",NA,17,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.25.221135v4?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.25.221135v4.full.pdf

Using a suite of statistical, population genetics, and theoretical approaches, we show that the globally most represented spike protein variant (i.e., the G clade, A [-&gt;] G nucleotide change at genomic position 23,403; D [-&gt;] G amino acid change at spike protein position 614) i) underwent a significant demographic expansion in most countries not explained by stochastic effects or enhanced pathogenicity; ii) affects the spike S1/S2 furin-like site increasing its conformational plasticity (short range effect), and iii) modifies the internal motion of the receptor-binding domain affecting its cross-connection with other functional domains (long-range effect).

Our study unambiguously links the spread of the G614 with a non-random process, and we hypothesize that this process is related to the selective advantage produced by a specific structural modification of the spike protein.

Among the various naturally-occurring mutations, the E484K mutation shared by both the 501Y.V2 and 501Y.V3 variants attracted serious concerns, which may potentially enhance the receptor binding affinity and reduce the immune response. In the present study, the molecular mechanism behind the impacts of E484K mutation on the binding affinity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) with the receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) was investigated by using the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with the molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MMGBSA) method. Our results indicate that the E484K mutation results in more favorable electrostatic interactions compensating the burial of the charged and polar groups upon the binding of RBD with hACE2, which significantly improves the RBD-hACE2 binding affinity. Besides that, the E484K mutation also causes the conformational rearrangements of the loop region containing the mutant residue, which leads to more tight binding interface of RBD with hACE2 and formation of some new hydrogen bonds. The more tight binding interface and the new hydrogen bonds formation also contribute to the improved binding affinity of RBD to the receptor hACE2. In addition, six neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies complexed with RBD were selected to explore the effects of E484K mutation on the recognition of these antibodies to RBD. The simulation results show that the E484K mutation significantly reduces the binding affinities to RBD for most of the studied neutralizing antibodies, and the decrease in the binding affinities is mainly owing to the unfavorable electrostatic interactions caused by the mutation. Our studies revealed that the E484K mutation may improve the binding affinity between RBD and the receptor hACE2, implying more transmissibility of the E484K-containing variants, and weaken the binding affinities between RBD and the studied neutralizing antibodies, indicating reduced effectiveness of these antibodies.

In addition to VCM, we also illustrate the data dictionary for patients phenotype used by the COVID-19 Host Genetic Initiative. Our effort is part of a broad vision: availability of conceptual models for both human genomics and viruses will provide important opportunities for research, especially if interconnected by the same human being, playing the role of virus host as well as provider of genomic and phenotype information.",NA,363,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.067637v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.067637v3.full.pdf

Reverse transcriptase droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR), a technology that partitions each reaction into 20,000 nanolitre-sized droplets prior to amplification, offers an attractive platform for SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification. We evaluated eight primer/probe sets originally developed for real-time RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests for use in RT-ddPCR, and identified three (Charite-Berlin E-Sarbeco and Pasteur Institute IP2 and IP4) as the most efficient, precise and sensitive for RT-ddPCR-based SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was one of the first drugs used to treat COVID-19 patients due to its supposed capacity of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in vitro.

While its efficacy is debated, HCQ has been associated with QT interval prolongation and potentially Torsades de Pointes, especially in patients predisposed to developing drug-induced Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) as silent carriers of variants associated with congenital LQTS. If confirmed, these effects represent a limitation to the at-home use of HCQ for COVID-19 infection as adequate ECG monitoring may be challenging.

We investigated the proarrhythmic profile of HCQ with Multi-Electrode Arrays after subchronic exposure of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from two healthy donors, one asymptomatic and two symptomatic LQTS patients.

We demonstrate that: I) HCQ induced a concentration-dependent Field Potential Duration (FPD) prolongation in vitro and triggered arrhythmias that halted the beating at high concentration. II) hiPSC-CMs from healthy or asymptomatic carriers tolerated higher concentrations of HCQ and showed lower susceptibility to HCQ-induced electrical abnormalities regardless of baseline FPD values. These findings agree with the clinical safety records of HCQ and demonstrated that hiPSC-CMs potentially discriminates symptomatic vs asymptomatic mutation carriers through pharmacological interventions.

A better understanding of the pathophysiology associated with COVID-19 is crucial to improve treatment modalities and to develop effective prevention strategies. Transcriptomic and proteomic data on the host response against SARS-CoV-2 still have anecdotic character; currently available data from other coronavirus infections are therefore a key source of information.

MethodsWe investigated selected molecular aspects of three human coronavirus (HCoV) infections, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, through a network based-approach. A functional analysis of HCoV-host interactome was carried out in order to provide a theoretic host-pathogen interaction model for HCoV infections and in order to translate the results in prediction for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

The 3D model of S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was compared to the structure of the corresponding SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV S-glycoprotein. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E and the host interactome were inferred through published protein-protein interactions (PPI) as well as gene co-expression, triggered by HCoV S-glycoprotein in host cells.

ResultsAlthough the amino acid sequences of the S-glycoprotein were found to be different between the various HCoV, the structures showed high similarity, but the best 3D structural overlap shared by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, consistent with the shared ACE2 predicted receptor. The host interactome, linked to the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, mainly highlighted innate immunity pathway components, such as Toll Like receptors, cytokines and chemokines.

ConclusionsIn this paper, we developed a network-based model with the aim to define molecular aspects of pathogenic phenotypes in HCoV infections.

Sequence analysis suggests that the three adjacent nucleotide changes that result in the K203/R204 variant have arisen by homologous recombination from the core sequence (CS) of the leader transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) as opposed to a step-wise mutation model. The resulting sequence changes generate a novel sub-genomic RNA transcript for the C-terminal dimerization domain. Deep sequencing data from 981 clinical samples confirmed the presence of the novel TRS-CS-dimerization domain RNA in individuals with the K203/R204 variant. Quantification of sub-genomic RNA indicates that viruses with the K203/R204 variant may also have increased expression of sub-genomic RNA from other open reading frames. The K203/R204 variant results in a novel sub-genomic RNA. The finding that homologous recombination from the TRS may have occurred since the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in humans resulting in both coding changes and novel sub-genomic RNA transcripts suggests this as a mechanism for diversification and adaptation within its new host.

ImportanceA major variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (R203K/G204R in the nucleocapsid) results in changes to the nucleocapsid at both the protein and RNA level. We show this variant likely arose by homologous recombination from the core sequence of the leader transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) elsewhere in the viral genome. This recombination event introduced a new TRS between the RNA binding and dimerization domains of nucleocapsid that generates a novel sub-genomic RNA transcript. Presence of the K203/R204 variant was significantly associated with increased expression of nucleocapsid and sub-genomic RNA from other open reading frames. The mechanism by which the virus generates diversity, specifically how this KR variant arose and how it generated a novel major sub-genomic transcript is relevant to how future major shifts may arise and their potential functional implications.",NA,5,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.029454v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.029454v2.full.pdf

Several strains of influenza A virus are shown to successfully infect the human primary cell-based airway tissue cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI), and as a proof-of-concept, the effect of the antiviral oseltamivir on one strain of Influenza A is evaluated. Human coronaviruses NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and SARS-CoV-2 enter host cells via ACE2 and utilize the protease TMPRSS2 for protein priming, and we confirm expression of both in our ALI model. We also demonstrate coronavirus infection in this system with HCoV-NL63, observing sufficient viral propagation over 96 hours post-infection to indicate successful infection of the primary cell-based model. This new capability has the potential to address a gap in the rapid assessment of therapeutic efficacy of various small molecules and antiviral agents against influenza and other respiratory viruses including coronaviruses.",NA,522,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.23.112797v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.23.112797v1.full.pdf

To investigate the role of S1R in SARS-CoV-2 infection in the heart, we used human cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CM) as an experimental model. Here we show that the S1R antagonist NE-100 decreases SARS-CoV-2 infection and viral replication in hiPSC-CMs. Also, NE-100 reduces cytokine release and cell death associated with infection. Because S1R is involved in cardiac physiology, we investigated the effects of NE-100 in cardiomyocyte morphology and function.

In this study, we firstly analyzed 20 convalescent serum samples collected from SARS-CoV infected individuals during the 2003 SARS outbreak. All patient sera reacted strongly with the S1 subunit and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV, cross-reacted with the S ectodomain, S1, RBD, and S2 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, and neutralized both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S protein-driven infections. Multiple panels of antisera from mice and rabbits immunized with a full-length S and RBD immunogens of SARS-CoV were also characterized, verifying the cross-reactive neutralization against SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, we found that a palm civet SARS-CoV-derived RBD elicited more potent cross-neutralizing responses in immunized animals than the RBD from a human SARS-CoV strain, informing a strategy to develop a universe vaccine against emerging CoVs.

An improved understanding of T-cell immunity will greatly aid in the development of new cancer immunotherapies and vaccines for life threatening pathogens. Central to the design of such targeted therapies are computational methods to predict non-native epitopes to elicit a T cell response, however, we currently lack accurate immunogenicity inference methods. Another challenge is the ability to accurately simulate immunogenic peptides for specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, for both synthetic biological applications and to augment real training datasets. Here, we proposed a beta-binomial distribution approach to derive epitope immunogenic potential from sequence alone. We conducted systematic benchmarking of five traditional machine learning (ElasticNet, KNN, SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost) and three deep learning models (CNN, ResNet, GNN) using three independent prior validated immunogenic peptide collections (dengue virus, cancer neoantigen and SARS-Cov-2). We chose the CNN model as the best prediction model based on its adaptivity for small and large datasets, and performance relative to existing methods. In addition to outperforming two highly used immunogenicity prediction algorithms, DeepHLApan and IEDB, DeepImmuno-CNN further correctly predicts which residues are most important for T cell antigen recognition. Our independent generative adversarial network (GAN) approach, DeepImmuno-GAN, was further able to accurately simulate immunogenic peptides with physiochemical properties and immunogenicity predictions similar to that of real antigens. We provide DeepImmuno-CNN as source code and an easy-to-use web interface.

To control emerging viruses, existing successful anti(retro)viral therapies can inspire antiviral strategies, as conserved viral enzymes (eg., viral proteases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases) represent targets of choice. Since 2003, much effort has been expended in the characterization of the SARS-CoV replication/transcription machinery. Until recently, a pure and highly active preparation of SARS-CoV recombinant RNA synthesis machinery was not available, impeding target-based high throughput screening of drug candidates against this viral family. The current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic revealed a new pathogen whose RNA synthesis machinery is highly (>96% aa identity) homologous to SARS-CoV. This phylogenetic relatedness highlights the potential use of conserved replication enzymes to discover inhibitors against this significant pathogen, which in turn, contributes to scientific preparedness against emerging viruses. Here, we report the use of a purified and highly active SARS-CoV replication/transcription complex (RTC) to set-up a high-throughput screening of Coronavirus RNA synthesis inhibitors. The screening of a small (1,520 compounds) chemical library of FDA-approved drugs demonstrates the robustness of our assay and will allow to speed-up drug repositioning or novel drug discovery against the SARS-CoV-2.

However, previous studies only characterized short-period SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE. In this study, continuously monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE-ALI cultures for a long period of up to 51 days revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection was long lasting with recurrent replication peaks appearing between an interval of approximately 7-10 days, which was consistent in all the tested HAE-ALI cultures derived from 4 lung bronchi of independent donors.

As for other RNA viruses, genomic RNA structures are expected to play crucial roles in several steps of the coronavirus replication cycle. Despite this, only a handful of functionally conserved structural elements within coronavirus RNA genomes have been identified to date.

Here, we performed RNA structure probing by SHAPE-MaP to obtain a single-base resolution secondary structure map of the full SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genome. The SHAPE-MaP probing data recapitulate the previously described coronavirus RNA elements (5' UTR, ribosomal frameshifting element, and 3' UTR), and reveal new structures. Secondary structure-restrained 3D modeling of highly-structured regions across the SARS-CoV-2 genome allowed for the identification of several putative druggable pockets. Furthermore, [~]8% of the identified structure elements show significant covariation among SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, hinting at their functionally-conserved role.

Here we developed a pilot-scale production of a purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate (PiCoVacc), which induced SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, rats and non-human primates. These antibodies potently neutralized 10 representative SARS-CoV-2 strains, indicative of a possible broader neutralizing ability against SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating worldwide. Immunization with two different doses (3g or 6 g per dose) provided partial or complete protection in macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, respectively, without any antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Systematic evaluation of PiCoVacc via monitoring clinical signs, hematological and biochemical index, and histophathological analysis in macaques suggests that it is safe.

SARS-Cov-2 entry into a cell is dependent upon binding of the viral spike (S) protein to cellular receptor and on cleavage of the spike protein by the host cell proteases such as Cathepsin L and Cathepsin B. CTSL/B are crucial elements of lysosomal pathway and both enzymes are almost exclusively located in the lysosomes.CTSL disruption offers potential for CoVID-19 therapies. The mechanisms of disruption include: decreasing expression of CTSL, direct inhibition of CTSL activity and affecting the conditions of CTSL environment (increase pH in lysosomes).

We have conducted a high throughput drug screen gene expression analysis to identify compounds that would downregulate the expression of CTSL/CTSB. One of the top significant results shown to downregulate the expression of the CTSL gene is Amantadine. Amantadine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as a prophylactic agent for influenza and later for Parkinsons disease. It is available as a generic drug..

Amantadine in addition to downregulating CTSL appears to further disrupt lysosomal pathway, hence interfering with the capacity of the virus to replicate. It acts as a lysosomotropic agent altering the CTSL functional environment. We hypothesize that Amantadine could decrease the viral load in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and as such it may serve as a potent therapeutic decreasing the replication and infectivity of the virus likely leading to better clinical outcomes.

Herein, we report the comprehensive and precise site-specific O-glycosylation landscapes of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins, which were characterized using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Following digestion using trypsin and trypsin/Glu-C, and de-N-glycosylation using PNGase F, we determined the mucin-type (GalNAc-type) O-glycosylation pattern of S proteins, including unambiguous O-glycosites and the 6 most common O-glycans occupying them, via Byonic identification and manual validation. Finally, 43 O-glycosites were identified in the insect cell-expressed S protein. Most glycosites were modified by non-sialylated O-glycans such as HexNAc(1) and HexNAc(1)Hex(1). In contrast, 30 O-glycosites were identified in the human cell-expressed S protein S1 subunit. Most glycosites were modified by sialylated O-glycans such as HexNAc(1)Hex(1)NeuAc(1) and HexNAc(1)Hex(1)NeuAc(2). Our results are the first to reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a mucin-type glycoprotein; clustered O-glycans often occur in the N- and the C-termini of the S protein, and the O-glycosite and O-glycan compositions vary with the host cell type.

However, how environmental exposure enhances the severity of COVID-19 remains to be fully understood. In the present report, we provide evidence showing that mdig, a previously reported environmentally-induced oncogene that antagonizes repressive trimethylation of histone proteins, is a master regulator for SARS-CoV-2 receptors neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and NRP2, cathepsins, glycan metabolism and inflammation, key determinants for viral infection and cytokine storm of the patients. Depletion of mdig in bronchial epithelial cells by CRISPR-Cas-9 gene editing resulted in a decreased expression of NRP1, NRP2, cathepsins, and genes involved in protein glycosylation and inflammation, largely due to a substantial enrichment of lysine 9 and/or lysine 27 trimethylation of histone H3 (H3K9me3/H3K27me3) on these genes as determined by ChIP-seq. These data, accordingly, suggest that mdig is a key mediator for the severity of COVID-19 in response to environmental exposure and targeting mdig may be one of the effective strategies in ameliorating the symptom and reducing the mortality of COVID-19.",NA,143,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.31.429010v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.31.429010v1.full.pdf

The definition of the correlates of protection necessary to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, require both immune parameters but the complexity of traditional tests limits virus-specific T cell measurements.

MethodsWe test the sensitivity and performance of a simple and rapid SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific T cell test based on stimulation of whole blood with peptides covering the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein followed by cytokine (IFN-{gamma}, IL-2) measurement in different cohorts including BNT162b2 vaccinated (n=112; 201 samples), convalescent asymptomatic (n=62; 62 samples) and symptomatic (n=68; 115 samples) COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-1 convalescent individuals (n=12; 12 samples).

ResultsThe sensitivity of the rapid cytokine whole blood test equates traditional methods of T cell analysis (ELISPOT, Activation Induced Markers). Utilizing this test we observed that Spike-specific T cells in vaccinated preferentially target the S2 region of Spike and that their mean magnitude is similar between them and SARS-CoV-2 convalescents at 3 months after vaccine or virus priming respectively. However, a wide heterogeneity of Spike-specific T cell magnitude characterizes the individual responses irrespective of the time of analysis. No correlation between neutralizing antibody levels and Spike-specific T cell magnitude were found.

ConclusionsRapid measurement of cytokine production in whole blood after peptide activation revealed a wide dynamic range of Spike-specific T cell response after vaccination that cannot be predicted from neutralizing antibody quantities.

Loss of biodiversity and our connectedness to nature, along with poor microbial literacy may be augmenting the negative consequences of germaphobia on ecosystem health. In this study, we created an online questionnaire to acquire data on attitudes towards, and knowledge of microbes. We collected data on nature connectedness and interactions with nature and explored the relationships between these variables. We found a significant association between attitudes towards microbes and both duration and frequency of visits to natural environments. A higher frequency of visits to nature per week, and a longer duration spent in nature per visit, significantly associated with positive attitudes towards microbes. We found no association between nature connectedness and attitudes towards microbes. We found a significant relationship between knowledge of  lesser known microbial groups (e.g., identifying that fungi, algae, protozoa, and archaea are microbes) and positive attitudes towards microbes. However, we also found that people who correctly identified viruses as being microbes expressed less positive views of microbes overall -- this could potentially be attributed to a  COVID-19 effect. Our results suggest that basic microbial literacy and nature engagement may be important in reducing/preventing germaphobia. The results also suggest that a virus-centric phenomenon (e.g., COVID-19) could increase broader germaphobia. As the rise of immune-related disorders and mental health conditions have been linked to germaphobia, reduced biodiversity, and non-targeted sterilisation, our findings point to a feasible strategy to potentially help ameliorate these negative consequences. A greater emphasis on microbial literacy and promoting time spent in nature could be useful in promoting resilience in human health and more positive/constructive attitudes towards the foundations of our ecosystems - the microorganisms.",NA,80,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.08.430200v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.08.430200v1.full.pdf

SARS-CoV-2 induced a strong antiviral response with upregulation of antiviral factors such as OAS1-3 and IFIT1-3, and Th1 chemokines CXCL9/10/11, as well as a reduction in transcription of ribosomal proteins. SARS-CoV-2 culture in human airway epithelial cultures replicated the in vivo antiviral host response. Patient-matched longitudinal specimens (mean elapsed time = 6.3 days) demonstrated reduction in interferon-induced transcription, recovery of transcription of ribosomal proteins, and initiation of wound healing and humoral immune responses. Expression of interferon-responsive genes, including ACE2, increased as a function of viral load, while transcripts for B cell-specific proteins and neutrophil chemokines were elevated in patients with lower viral load. Older individuals had reduced expression of Th1 chemokines CXCL9/10/11 and their cognate receptor, CXCR3, as well as CD8A and granzyme B, suggesting deficiencies in trafficking and/or function of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells.

In our investigations to determine the protective responses of the viral epitopes, we unexpectedly noted that animals immunized with complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) alone and later challenged with CVB3 were completely protected against myocarditis. Similarly, the pancreatitis-inducing ability of CVB3 was remarkably reduced to only 10% in the CFA group as opposed to 73.3% in the control group that received no CFA.

Rapid SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is often unavailable but could support public health organizations and hospitals in monitoring and determining transmission links. Here we report the use of reverse complement polymerase chain reaction (RC-PCR), a novel technology for WGS of SARS-CoV-2 enabling library preparation in a single PCR saving time, resources and enables high throughput screening. Additionally, we show SARS-CoV-2 diversity and possible transmission within the Radboud university medical center (Radboudumc) during September 2020 using RC-PCR WGS.

MethodsA total of 173 samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March and September 2020 were selected for whole-genome sequencing. Ct values of the samples ranged from 16 to 42. They were collected from 83 healthcare workers and three patients at the Radboudumc, in addition to 64 people living in the area around the hospital and tested by the local health services. For validation purposes, nineteen of the included samples were previously sequenced using Oxford Nanopore Technologies and compared to RC-PCR WGS results. The applicability of RC-PCR WGS in outbreak analysis for public health service and hospitals was tested on six suspected clusters containing samples of healthcare workers and patients with an epidemiological link.

FindingsRC-PCR resulted in sequencing data for 146 samples. It showed a genome coverage of up to 98,2% for samples with a maximum Ct value of 32. Comparison to Oxford Nanopore technologies gives a near-perfect agreement on 95% of the samples (18 out of 19). Three out of six clusters with a suspected epidemiological link were fully confirmed, in the others, four healthcare workers were not associated. In the public health service samples, a previously unknown chain of transmission was confirmed.

Significance statementSAR-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing using RC-PCR is a reliable technique and applicable for use in outbreak analysis and surveillance. Its ease of use, high-trough screening capacity and wide applicability makes it a valuable addition or replacement during this ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSAt present whole genome sequencing techniques for SARS-CoV-2 have a large turnover time and are not widely available. Only a few laboratories are currently able to perform large scale SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. This restricts the use of sequencing to aid hospital and community infection prevention.

Added value of this studyHere we present clinical and technical data on a novel Whole Genome Sequencing technology, implementing reverse-complement PCR. It is able to obtain high genome coverage of SARS-CoV-2 and confirm and exclude epidemiological links in 173 healthcare workers and patients. The RC-PCR technology simplifies the workflow thereby reducing hands on time. It combines targeted PCR and sequence library construction in a single PCR, which normally takes several steps. Additionally, this technology can be used in concordance with the widely available range of Illumina sequencers.

Dexamethasone can limit inflammation by inhibiting the activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors. High dose dexamethasone, however, has undesirable side effects. Here, we show that Ceylon cinnamon and its major compound cinnamaldehyde can mitigate inflammatory signaling in vitro.

Small molecules that interfere with binding of the viral spike receptor binding domain (RBD) to the host ACE2 receptor may be effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Here we screened 512 pure compounds derived from natural products using a high-throughput RBD/ACE2 binding assay and identified (-)-hopeaphenol, a resveratrol tetramer, in addition to vatalbinoside A and vaticanol B, as potent and selective inhibitors of RBD/ACE2 binding and viral entry. For example, (-)-hopeaphenol disrupted RBD/ACE2 binding with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.11 M in contrast to an IC50 of 28.3 M against the unrelated host ligand/receptor binding pair PD-1/PD-L1 (selectivity index = 257.3). When assessed against the USA-WA1/2020 variant, (-)-hopeaphenol also inhibited entry of a VSV{Delta}G-GFP reporter pseudovirus expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike into ACE2-expressing Vero-E6 cells and in vitro replication of infectious virus in cytopathic effect assays (IC50 = 10.2 M) without cytotoxicity.

Thus, there is an urgent need for treatments that can lessen the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in patients who become seriously affected. Many viruses including HIV, the common cold, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use a unique mechanism known as -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) to successfully replicate and infect cells in the human host. SARS-CoV (the coronavirus responsible for SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 possess a unique RNA structure, a three-stemmed pseudoknot, that stimulates -1 PRF. Recent experiments identified that small molecules can be introduced as antiviral agents to bind with the pseudoknot and disrupt its stimulation of -1 PRF. If successfully developed, small molecule therapy that targets -1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2 is an excellent strategy to improve patients prognoses. Crucial to developing these successful therapies is modeling the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF pseudoknot. Following a structural alignment approach, we identify similarities in the -1 PRF pseudoknots of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the original SARS-CoV, as well as a third coronavirus: MERS-CoV, the coronavirus responsible for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).

Aiming to understand a host genetic component of COVID-19, we focused on variants in genes encoding proteases and genes involved in innate immunity that could be important for susceptibility and resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Analysis of sequence data of coding regions of FURIN, PLG, PRSS1, TMPRSS11a, MBL2 and OAS1 genes in 143 unrelated individuals from Serbian population identified 22 variants with potential functional effect. In silico analyses (PolyPhen-2, SIFT, MutPred2 and Swiss-Pdb Viewer) predicted that 10 variants could impact the structure and/or function of proteins. These protein-altering variants (p.Gly146Ser in FURIN; p.Arg261His and p.Ala494Val in PLG; p.Asn54Lys in PRSS1; p.Arg52Cys, p.Gly54Asp and p.Gly57Glu in MBL2; p.Arg47Gln, p.Ile99Val and p.Arg130His in OAS1) may have predictive value for inter-individual differences in the response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Next, we performed comparative population analysis for the same variants using extracted data from the 1000 genomes project. Population genetic variability was assessed using delta MAF and Fst statistics. Our study pointed to 7 variants in PLG, TMPRSS11a, MBL2 and OAS1 genes with noticeable divergence in allelic frequencies between populations worldwide.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) glycoprotein is a major immunogenic and protective protein, and plays a crucial role in viral pathogenesis. In this study, we successfully constructed a synthetic codon-optimized DNA-based vaccine as a countermeasure against SARS-CoV-2; denoted as VIU-1005. The design was based on the synthesis of codon-optimized coding sequence for optimal mammalian expression of a consensus full-length S glycoprotein. The successful construction of the vaccine was confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing, and the protein expression of the S protein was confirmed by western blot and immunofluorescence staining in mammalian cells. The immunogenicity of the vaccine was tested in two mouse models (BALB/c and C57BL/6J). Th1-skewed systemic S-specific IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were significantly induced in both models four weeks post three injections with 100 g of the VIU-1005 vaccine via intramuscular needle injection but not intradermal or subcutaneous routes. Importantly, such immunization induced long-lasting IgG response in mice that lasted for at least 6 months. Interestingly, using a needle-free system, we showed an enhanced immunogenicity of VIU-1005 in which lower doses such as 25-50 g or less number of doses were able to elicit significantly high levels of Th1-biased systemic S-specific IgG antibodies and nAbs via intramuscular immunization compared to needle immunization. Compared to the intradermal needle injection which failed to induce any significant immune response, intradermal needle-free immunization elicited robust Th1-biased humoral response similar to that observed with intramuscular immunization. Furthermore, immunization with VIU-1005 induced potent S-specific cellular response as demonstrated by the significantly high levels of IFN-{gamma}, TNF and IL-2 cytokines production in memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in BALB/c mice. Together, our results demonstrate that the synthetic VIU-1005 candidate DNA vaccine is highly immunogenic and capable of inducing long-lasting and Th1-skewed immune response in mice.

Some viruses use specific packaging signals, which are conserved sequence/structure motifs present only in the full-length genome. Recent work has shown that viral proteins important for packaging can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), where one or two viral nucleic acid binding proteins condense with the genome. The compositional simplicity of viral components lends itself well to theoretical modeling compared to more complex cellular organelles. Viral LLPS can be limited to one or two viral proteins and a single genome that is enriched in LLPS-promoting features. In our previous study, we observed that LLPS-promoting sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are located at the 5' and 3' ends of the genome, whereas the middle of the genome is predicted to consist mostly of solubilizing elements. Is this arrangement sufficient to drive single genome packaging, genome compaction, and genome cyclization? We addressed these questions using a coarse-grained polymer model, LASSI, to study the LLPS of nucleocapsid protein with RNA sequences that either promote LLPS or solubilization. With respect to genome cyclization, we find the most optimal arrangement restricts LLPS-promoting elements to the 5' and 3' ends of the genome, consistent with the native spatial patterning. Genome compaction is enhanced by clustered LLPS-promoting binding sites, while single genome packaging is most efficient when binding sites are distributed throughout the genome. These results suggest that many and variably positioned LLPS-promoting signals can support packaging in the absence of a singular packaging signal which argues against necessity of such a feature. We hypothesize that this model should be generalizable to multiple viruses as well as cellular organelles like paraspeckles, which enrich specific, long RNA sequences in a defined arrangement.

Statement of significanceThe COVID-19 pandemic has motivated research of the basic mechanisms of coronavirus replication. A major challenge faced by viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 is the selective packaging of a large genome in a relatively small capsid while excluding host and sub-genomic nucleic acids. Genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 can condense with the Nucleocapsid (N-protein), a structural protein component critical for packaging of many viruses. Notably, certain regions of the genomic RNA drive condensation of N-protein while other regions solubilize it. Here, we explore how the spatial patterning of these opposing elements promotes single genome compaction, packaging, and cyclization. This model informs future in silico experiments addressing spatial patterning of genomic features that are experimentally intractable because of the length of the genome.",NA,34,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.06.425605v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.06.425605v2.full.pdf

Currently, there is no effective therapy against this virus. This article evaluated the in vitro antiviral effect of Atorvastatin against SARS-CoV-2 and also identified the interaction affinity between Atorvastatin and three SARS-CoV-2 proteins, using in silico structure-based molecular docking approach.

Materials and methodsThe antiviral activity of Atorvastatin against SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated by three different treatment strategies using a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. The interaction of Atorvastatin with Spike, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro) was evaluated by molecular docking.

ResultsAtorvastatin showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of 79%, 54.8%, 22.6% and 25% at 31.2, 15.6, 7.9, and 3.9 {micro}M, respectively, by pre-post-treatment strategy. In addition, atorvastatin demonstrated an antiviral effect of 26.9% at 31.2 {micro}M by pre-infection treatment. This compound also inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in 66.9%, 75%, 27.9% and 29.2% at concentrations of 31.2, 15.6, 7.9, and 3.9 {micro}M, respectively, by post-infection treatment. The interaction of atorvastatin with SARS-CoV-2 Spike, RdRp and 3CL protease yielded a binding affinity of -8.5 Kcal/mol, -6.2 Kcal/mol, and -7.5 Kcal/mol, respectively.

ConclusionOur study demonstrated the in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of Atorvastatin, mainly against the late steps of the viral replicative cycle. A favorable binding affinity with viral proteins by bioinformatics methods was also shown. Due to its low cost, availability, well-established safety and tolerability, and the extensive clinical experience of atorvastatin, it could prove valuable in reducing morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.

ImportanceThe COVID-19 pandemic constitutes the largest global public health crisis in a century, with enormous health and socioeconomic challenges. Therefore, it is necessary to search for specific antivirals against its causative agent (SARS-CoV-2). In this sense, the use of existing drugs may represent a useful treatment option in terms of safety, cost-effectiveness, and timeliness. Atorvastatin is widely used to prevent cardiovascular events.

In this paper, we describe a drug repurposing strategy based on a virtual screening of druggable pockets located in the central β-sheet core of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein RBD supported by in vitro tests identifying several steroidal derivatives as SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors. Our results demonstrate that several potential binding sites exist in the SARS CoV-2 S protein, and that the occupancy of these pockets reduces the ability of the S protein RBD to bind to the ACE2 consensus in vitro. In particular, natural occurring and clinically available steroids as glycyrrhetinic and oleanolic acids, as well as the bile acids derivatives glyco-UDCA and obeticholic acid have been shown to be effective in preventing virus entry in the case of low viral load.

Efficacy is observed against the six viral families causing most human respiratory viral disease, irrespective of strain, including both influenza (FLUV) and SARS-CoV-2, with cell culture EC50 at or below 100 nM. Survival benefit is demonstrated in pigs against another member of family Coronaviridae, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and shown equally effective in mild and severe disease. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) titer is reduced by drug treatment in cotton rats. A substantial barrier to viral resistance is demonstrated for FLUV. Drug resin affinity chromatography (DRAC) reveals a novel drug target: a multi-protein complex (MPC) formed transiently, in an energy-dependent fashion, and composed of host proteins implicated in both viral lifecycles and manipulation of innate immunity. The protein composition of this host MPC is modified upon viral infection, with increase or decrease of some proteins and appearance or complete loss of others. Valosin-containing protein, also known as Transitional endoplasmatic reticulum ATPase (VCP/p97), is present in the target MPC of uninfected cells and significantly increased in both FLUV and CoV infection. SQSTM1/p62, a key regulator of the autophagy pathway of innate immunity whose dysfunction is implicated in cytokine storm, is i) found in the target MPC from uninfected cells, ii) diminished in DRAC eluates by infection, and iii) restored by drug treatment of infected cells. 14-3-3 is one of likely several proteins that comprise the drug-binding site. Advanced compounds with improved pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and lung exposure are approaching criteria for a Target Product Profile. We propose these novel drug targets to comprise a previously unappreciated molecular basis for homeostasis that is modified by viruses to allow exploitation for viral propagation and is restored by treatment with the therapeutic compounds presented.

Now, there is a direct need for additional small animal models to study the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and for fast-tracked medical countermeasure development. Here, we show that transgenic mice expressing the human SARS-CoV-2 receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]) under a cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18) are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that infection resulted in a dose-dependent lethal disease course. After inoculation with either 104 TCID50 or 105 TCID50, the SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in rapid weight loss in both groups and uniform lethality in the 105 TCID50 group. High levels of viral RNA shedding were observed from the upper and lower respiratory tract and intermittent shedding was observed from the intestinal tract. Inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in upper and lower respiratory tract infection with high infectious virus titers in nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs. The observed interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary pathology, with SARS-CoV-2 replication evident in pneumocytes, were similar to that reported in severe cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and upregulation of Th1 and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Extrapulmonary replication of SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of several animals at 7 DPI but not at 3 DPI. The rapid inflammatory response and observed pathology bears resemblance to COVID-19. Taken together, this suggests that this mouse model can be useful for studies of pathogenesis and medical countermeasure development.

Authors SummaryThe disease manifestation of COVID-19 in humans range from asymptomatic to severe. While several mild to moderate disease models have been developed, there is still a need for animal models that recapitulate the severe and fatal progression observed in a subset of patients. Here, we show that humanized transgenic mice developed dose-dependent disease when inoculated with SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. The mice developed upper and lower respiratory tract infection, with virus replication also in the brain after day 3 post inoculation. The pathological and immunological diseases manifestation observed in these mice bears resemblance to human COVID-19, suggesting increased usefulness of this model for elucidating COVID-19 pathogenesis further and testing of countermeasures, both of which are urgently needed.",10.1371/journal.ppat.1009195,322,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.246314v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.246314v1.full.pdf

As a result, novel therapeutic strategies are in high demand. Viral entry into target cells is frequently sensitive to cell membrane lipid composition and membrane organization. Evidence suggests that cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 is most efficient when the target cell plasma membrane is replete with cholesterol; and recent data implicate cholesterol flux through the high-affinity receptor for cholesterol-rich high-density lipoprotein (HDL), called scavenger receptor type B-1 (SR-B1), as critical for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Here, we demonstrate that a cholesterol-poor synthetic biologic high-density lipoprotein (HDL NP) targets SR-B1 and inhibits cell entry of a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudovirus. Human cells expressing SR-B1 are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and viral entry can be inhibited by 50-80% using HDL NPs in an SR-B1-dependent manner.

Four structural proteins, envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) glycoprotein, play a key role in controlling the entry into human cells and virion assembly of SARS-CoV-2. However, how these genes evolve during its human to human transmission is largely unknown. In this study, we screened and analyzed roughly 3090 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from GenBank database. The distribution of the four gene alleles is determined:16 for E, 40 for M, 131 for N and 173 for S genes. Phylogenetic analysis shows that global SARS-CoV-2 isolates can be clustered into three to four major clades based on the protein sequences of these genes. Intragenic recombination event isnt detected among different alleles. However, purifying selection has conducted on the evolution of these genes. By analyzing full genomic sequences of these alleles using codon-substitution models (M8, M3 and M2a) and likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) of codeML package, it reveals that codon 614 of S glycoprotein has subjected to strong positive selection pressure and a persistent D614G mutation is identified. The definitive positive selection of D614G mutation is further confirmed by internal fixed effects likelihood (IFEL) and Evolutionary Fingerprinting methods implemented in Hyphy package. In addition, another potential positive selection site at codon 5 in the signal sequence of the S protein is also identified. The allele containing D614G mutation has undergone significant expansion during SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, implying a better adaptability of isolates with the mutation. However, L5F allele expansion is relatively restricted. The D614G mutation is located at the subdomain 2 (SD2) of C-terminal portion (CTP) of the S1 subunit. Protein structural modeling shows that the D614G mutation may cause the disruption of salt bridge among S protein monomers increase their flexibility, and in turn promote receptor binding domain (RBD) opening, virus attachment and entry into host cells. Located at the signal sequence of S protein as it is, L5F mutation may facilitate the protein folding, assembly, and secretion of the virus. This is the first evidence of positive Darwinian selection in the spike gene of SARS-CoV-2, which contributes to a better understanding of the adaptive mechanism of this virus and help to provide insights for developing novel therapeutic approaches as well as effective vaccines by targeting on mutation sites.",NA,111,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.170688v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.170688v2.full.pdf

Small molecule inhibitors that reverse disease severity have proven difficult to discover. One of the key approaches that has been widely applied in an effort to speed up the translation of drugs is drug repurposing. A few drugs have shown in vitro activity against Ebola virus and demonstrated activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. Most notably the RNA polymerase targeting remdesivir demonstrated activity in vitro and efficacy in the early stage of the disease in humans. Testing other small molecule drugs that are active against Ebola virus would seem a reasonable strategy to evaluate their potential for SARS-CoV-2. We have previously repurposed pyronaridine, tilorone and quinacrine (from malaria, influenza, and antiprotozoal uses, respectively) as inhibitors of Ebola and Marburg virus in vitro in HeLa cells and of mouse adapted Ebola virus in mouse in vivo. We have now tested these three drugs in various cell lines (VeroE6, Vero76, Caco-2, Calu-3, A549-ACE2, HUH-7 and monocytes) infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as other viruses (including MHV and HCoV 229E). The compilation of these results indicated considerable variability in antiviral activity observed across cell lines. We found that tilorone and pyronaridine inhibited the virus replication in A549-ACE2 cells with IC50 values of 180 nM and IC50 198 nM, respectively. We have also tested them in a pseudovirus assay and used microscale thermophoresis to test the binding of these molecules to the spike protein. They bind to spike RBD protein with Kd values of 339 nM and 647 nM, respectively. Human Cmax for pyronaridine and quinacrine is greater than the IC50 hence justifying in vivo evaluation. We also provide novel insights into their mechanism which is likely lysosomotropic.",10.1021/acsomega.0c05996,400,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.01.407361v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.01.407361v1.full.pdf

The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) promotes viral entry3. We find that halofuginone reduces HS biosynthesis, thereby reducing spike protein binding, SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus, and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Halofuginone also potently suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication post-entry and is 1,000-fold more potent than Remdesivir4. Inhibition of HS biosynthesis and SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on specific inhibition of PRS, possibly due to translational suppression of proline-rich proteins. We find that pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins of SARS-CoV-2, as well as several HS proteoglycans, are proline-rich, which may make them particularly vulnerable to halofuginones translational suppression. Halofuginone is orally bioavailable, has been evaluated in a phase I clinical trial in humans and distributes to SARS-CoV-2 target organs, including the lung, making it a near-term clinical trial candidate for the treatment of COVID-19.",NA,37,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.22.436522v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.22.436522v3.full.pdf

We have constructed a novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, CoVac501, which is a self-adjuvanting peptide vaccine conjugated with Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonists. The vaccine contains two immunodominant peptides screened from receptor-binding domain (RBD) and is fully chemically synthesized. And the vaccine has optimized nanoemulsion formulation, outstanding stability and safety. In non-human primates (NHPs), CoVac501 elicited high and persistent titers of RBD-specific and protective neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), which were also effective to RBD mutations. CoVac501 was found to elicit the increase of memory T cells, antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses and Th1-biased CD4+ T cell immune responses in NHPs. More importantly, the sera from the immunized NHPs can prevent infection of live SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.

Especially, the variant B.1.351 in South Africa with the hallmark of triple mutations (N501Y, K417N and E484K) is worrisome. Quickly after the outbreak of this new variant, several studies showed that both N501Y and E484K can enhance the binding between RBD and the human ACE2 receptor. However, the mutation K417N seems to be unfavorable because it removes one interfacial salt-bridge. So far, it is still not well understood why the K417N mutation is selected in the viral evolution. Here, we show that despite the loss in the binding affinity (1.48 kcal/mol) between RBD and ACE2 the K417N mutation abolishes a buried interfacial salt-bridge between RBD and the neutralizing antibody CB6 and thus substantially reduces their binding energy by 9.59 kcal/mol, facilitating the variants to efficiently elude CB6 (as well as many other antibodies). Thus, when proliferating from person to person the virus might have adapted to the human immune system through evasive mutations. Taking into account limited and relevant experimental works in the field, we show that our theoretical predictions are consistent with existing experimental findings. By harnessing the revealed molecular mechanism for variants, it becomes feasible to redesign therapeutic antibodies accordingly to make them more efficacious.

However, these reported models and their associated electrostatic potential maps represent an unknown admixture of conformations stemming from the underlying energy landscape of the spike protein. As for any protein, some of the spikes conformational motions are expected to be biophysically relevant, but cannot be interpreted only by static models. Using experimental cryo-EM images, we present the energy landscape of the spike protein conformations, and identify molecular rearrangements along the most-likely conformational path in the vicinity of the open (so called 1RBD-up) state. The resulting global and local atomic refinements reveal larger movements than those expected by comparing the reported 1RBD-up and 1RBD-down cryo-EM models. Here we report greater degrees of ""openness"" in global conformations of the 1RBD-up state, not revealed in the single-model interpretations of the density maps, together with conformations that overlap with the reported models. We discover how the glycan shield contributes to the stability of these conformations along the minimum free-energy pathway. A local analysis of seven key binding pockets reveals that six out them, including those for engaging ACE2, therapeutic mini-proteins, linoleic acid, two different kinds of antibodies, and protein-glycan interaction sites, switch conformations between their known apo- and holo-conformations, even when the global spike conformation is 1RBD-up. This is reminiscent of a conformational pre-equilibrium.

Extensive studies on interferon-induced intracellular signal transduction pathways led to the elucidation of the Jak-Stat pathway. Furthermore, advances in gene expression profiling by microarrays have revealed that type I interferon rapidly induced multiple transcription factor mRNA levels. In this study, transcription factor profiling in the transcriptome was used to gain novel insights into the role of inducible transcription factors in response to type I interferon signaling in immune cells and in lung epithelial cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Modeling the interferon-inducible transcription factor mRNA data in terms of distinct sub-networks based on biological functions such as antiviral response, immune modulation, and cell growth revealed enrichment of specific transcription factors in mouse and human immune cells. The evolutionarily conserved core type I interferon gene expression consists of the inducible transcriptional factor mRNA of the antiviral response sub-network and enriched in granulocytes. Analysis of the type I interferon-inducible transcription factor sub-networks as distinct protein-protein interaction pathways revealed insights into the role of critical hubs in signaling.

ResultsThe number of people to test and frequency of testing needed depended on turnaround time, facility size, and test characteristics. Parameters are calculated for a variety of scenarios.

Here we perform computational modeling of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA localization across eight subcellular neighborhoods. We compare hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to the human transcriptome and other coronaviruses and perform systematic sub-sequence analyses to identify the responsible signals.

The 5 and 3 viral untranslated regions possess the strongest and most distinct localization signals.

In this study, efforts were made to check the infectivity of a local SARS-CoV-2 isolate in hamster model and evaluate the differential expression of lung proteins during acute infection and convalescence. The findings of this study confirm the infectivity of this isolate in vivo. Analysis of clinical parameters and tissue samples shows a similar type of pathophysiological manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection as reported earlier in COVID-19 patients and hamsters infected with other isolates. The lung-associated pathological changes were very prominent on the 4th day post-infection (dpi), mostly resolved by 14dpi. Here, we carried out quantitative proteomic analysis of the lung tissues from SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters at day 4 and day 14 post infection. This resulted in the identification of 1,585 differentially expressed proteins of which 68 proteins were significantly altered among both the infected groups. Pathway analysis revealed complement and coagulation cascade, platelet activation, ferroptosis and focal adhesion as the top enriched pathways. In addition, we also identified altered expression of two pulmonary surfactant-associated proteins (Sftpd and Sftpb), known for their protective role in lung function. Together, these findings will aid in the identification of candidate biomarkers and understanding the mechanism(s) involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

This is especially important if the disease-causing agent has no effective treatment, such as the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (the pathogen causing COVID-19), and shows no or similar symptoms to other common infections. We report a silicon-based integrated Point-of-Need (PoN) transducer (TriSilix) that can chemically-amplify and detect pathogen-specific sequences of nucleic acids (NA) quantitatively in real-time. Unlike other silicon-based technologies, TriSilix can be produced at wafer-scale in a standard laboratory; we have developed a series of methodologies based on metal-assisted chemical (wet) etching, electroplating, thermal bonding and laser-cutting to enable a cleanroom-free low-cost fabrication that does not require processing in an advanced semiconductor foundry. TriSilix is, therefore, resilient to disruptions in the global supply chain as the devices can be produced anywhere in the world. To create an ultra-low-cost device, the architecture proposed exploits the intrinsic properties of silicon and integrates three modes of operation in a single chip: i) electrical (Joule) heater, ii) temperature sensor (i.e. thermistor) with a negative temperature coefficient that can provide the precise temperature of the sample solution during reaction and iii) electrochemical sensor for detecting target NA. Using TriSilix, the sample solution can be maintained at a single, specific temperature (needed for isothermal amplification of NA such as Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) or cycled between different temperatures (with a precision of {+/-}1.3{degrees}C) for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) while the exact concentration of amplicons is measured quantitatively and in real-time electrochemically. A single 4-inch Si wafer yields 37 TriSilix chips of 10x10x0.65 mm in size and can be produced in 7 hours, costing ~US $0.35 per device. The system is operated digitally, portable and low power - capable of running up to 35 tests with a 4000 mAh battery (a typical battery capacity of a modern smartphone).

Severe RNA virus respiratory infections often correlate with high viral load and excessive inflammation. Understanding the dynamics of the innate immune response and its manifestation at the cell and tissue levels are vital to understanding the mechanisms of immunopathology and developing improved, strain independent treatments. Here, we present a novel spatialized multicellular spatial computational model of two principal components of tissue infection and response: RNA virus replication and type-I interferon mediated antiviral response to infection within lung epithelial cells. The model is parameterized using data from influenza virus infected cell cultures and, consistent with experimental observations, exhibits either linear radial growth of viral plaques or arrested plaque growth depending on the local concentration of type I interferons. Modulating the phosphorylation of STAT or altering the ratio of the diffusion constants of interferon and virus in the cell culture could lead to plaque growth arrest. The dependence of arrest on diffusion constants highlights the importance of developing validated spatial models of cytokine signaling and the need for in vitro experiments to measure these diffusion constants. Sensitivity analyses were performed under conditions creating both continuous plaque growth and arrested plaque growth. Findings suggest that plaque growth and cytokine assay measurements should be collected during arrested plaque growth, as the model parameters are significantly more sensitive and more likely to be identifiable. The models metrics replicate experimental immunostaining imaging and titer based sampling assays. The model is easy to extend to include SARS-CoV-2-specific mechanisms as they are discovered or to include as a component linking epithelial cell signaling to systemic immune models.

Author SummaryCOVID-19 is possibly the defining healthcare crisis of the current generation, with tens of millions of global cases and more than a million reported deaths. Respiratory lung infections form lesions in the lungs, whose number and size correlate with severity of illness. In some severe cases, the disease triggers a severe inflammatory condition known as cytokine storm. Given the complexity of the immune system, computational modeling is needed to link molecular signaling at the site of inflection to the signaling impact on the overall immune system, ultimately revealing how severe inflammatory conditions may emerge. Here, we created a computational model of the early stages of infection that simulates lung cells infected with RNA viruses, such those responsible for COVID-19 and influenza, to help explore how the disease forms viral plaques, an in vitro analog to lesion growth in the lung. Our model recapitulates in vitro observations that pretreatment of biological signaling molecules called with type-I interferons, which are currently being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19. Analyzing the model, we, can stop viral plaque growth. We found that enhancing certain aspects of the innate immune system, such as the JAK/STAT pathway, may be able to stop viral plaque growth, suggesting molecules involved in this pathway as possible drug candidates. Quantifying the parameters needed to model interferon signaling and viral replication, experiments should be performed under conditions that inhibit viral growth, such as pretreating cells with interferon. We present a computational framework that is essential to constructing larger models of respiratory infection induced immune responses, can be used to evaluate drugs and other medical interventions quickly, cheaply, and without the need for animal testing during the initial phase, and that defines experiments needed to improve our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms regulating the immune response.",NA,199,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.16.435618v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.16.435618v1.full.pdf

Evidence is growing that these responses are critical in SARS -CoV-2 immunity. Assessment of a SARS -CoV-2 spike ferritin nanoparticle (SpFN) immunogen paired with two distinct adjuvants, Alhydrogel(R) (AH) or Army Liposome Formulation containing QS-21 (ALFQ) demonstrated unique vaccine evoked immune signatures. SpFN+ALFQ enhanced recruitment of highly activated classical and non -classical antigen presenting cells (APCs) to the vaccine-draining lymph nodes of mice. The multifaceted APC response of SpFN+ALFQ vaccinated mice was associated with an increased frequency of polyfunctional spike -specific T cells with a bias towards TH1 responses and more robust SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific recall response. In addition, SpFN+ALFQ induced Kb spike(539-546)-specific memory CD8+ T cells with effective cytolytic function and distribution to the lungs. This epitope is also present in SARS-CoV, thus suggesting that generation of cross-reactive T cells may provide protection against other coronavirus strains.

Some of these variants exhibited increased replication, higher transmission and virulence, and were partially resistant to antibody neutralization from natural infection or vaccination. With over 130 million confirmed cases and widespread vaccination around the globe, the emergence of new escape SARS-CoV-2 variants could be accelerated. New therapeutics insensitive to mutations are thus urgently needed.

Most importantly, the inhibitor was equally effective against other coronavirus spike proteins that shared as low as 35% amino-acid sequence identity, underscoring its extreme tolerance to mutations. The small-sized inhibitor would also allow simple delivery by, for instance, nasal spray. We expect the inhibitor reported here to be an invaluable aid to help end COVID-19 pandemic.

Dominating a heat map of the aggregated predictions, 3 histidine residues in S2 are consistently predicted as destabilising in pre-fusion (all 3) and post-fusion (2 of 3) structures. Other predicted features include the more moderate energetics of surface salt-bridge interactions, and sidechain-mainchain interactions. Two aspartic acid residues in partially buried salt-bridges (D290 - R273 and R355 - D398) have pKas that are calculated to be elevated and destabilising in more open forms of the spike trimer. These aspartic acids are most stabilised in a tightly closed conformation that has been observed when linoleic acid is bound, and which also affects the interactions of D614. The D614G mutation is known to modulate the balance of closed to open trimer. It is suggested that D398 in particular contributes to a pH-dependence of the open/closed equilibrium, potentially coupled to the effects of linoleic acid binding and D614G mutation, and possibly also A570D mutation.

For example, MICHA provides an integrative web server and database to obtain compound annotation including chemical structures, targets and disease indications. In addition, the annotation of cell line samples, assay protocols and literature references can be greatly eased by retrieving manually curated catalogues. Once the annotation is complete, MICHA can export a report that conforms to the FAIR principle (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) of drug screening studies. To consolidate the utility of MICHA, we provide FAIRified protocols from several major cancer drug screening studies, as well as recently conducted COVID-19 studies. With the integrative webserver and database, we envisage a wider adoption of the MICHA strategy to foster a community-driven effort to improve the open access of drug sensitivity assays.",NA,300,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.03.409409v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.03.409409v1.full.pdf

However, the lack of biologically relevant pre-clinical experimental models of SARS-CoV-2 infection as a complement of classic cell lines represents a major barrier for scientific and medical progress. Here, we advantageously used human reconstituted airway epithelial models of nasal or bronchial origin to characterize viral infection kinetics, tissue-level remodeling of the cellular ultrastructure and transcriptional immune signatures induced by SARS-CoV-2. Our results underline the relevance of this model for the preclinical evaluation of antiviral candidates.

Synthetic HS mimetic pixatimod is a drug candidate for cancer with immunomodulatory and heparanase-inhibiting properties. Here we show that pixatimod binds to and destabilizes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (S1-RBD), and directly inhibits its binding to human ACE2, consistent with molecular modelling identification of multiple molecular contacts and overlapping pixatimod and ACE2 binding sites. Assays with multiple clinical isolates of live SARS-CoV-2 virus show that pixatimod potently inhibits infection of monkey Vero E6 and human bronchial epithelial cells at concentrations within its safe therapeutic dose range. Furthermore, in a K18-hACE2 mouse model pixatimod demonstrates that pixatimod markedly attenuates SARS-CoV-2 viral titer and COVID-19-like symptoms. This demonstration of potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity establishes proof-of-concept for targeting the HS-Spike protein-ACE2 axis with synthetic HS mimetics.

A major concern is whether the available vaccines will be equally effective against these variants. The vaccines are designed to induce an immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein7, 8, which is required for viral entry to host cells9. Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is often evaluated by antibody production, while less is known about the T-cell response. Here we developed, characterized, and implemented two standardized, functional assays to measure T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in uninfected, convalescent, and vaccinated individuals. We found that vaccinated individuals had robust T-cell responses to the wild type spike and nucleocapsid proteins, even more so than convalescent patients. We also found detectable but diminished T-cell responses to spike variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.1.248) among vaccinated but otherwise healthy donors. Since decreases in antibody neutralization have also been observed with some variants10-12, investigation into the T-cell response to these variants as an alternative means of viral control is imperative.

Higher input amounts of bacteriophage Phi6 are shown to delay and protect the phage from environmental decay, both when the phage are dried in plastic tubes, and when they are stored in saline solution at 4{degrees}C. When bacteriophage Phi6 are placed in LB (Luria-Bertani) growth medium prior to placement on the plastic surface, viral recovery is not influenced by the starting concentration. The protection is reflected in longer half-lives of the phage at higher concentrations compared to lower. Because experiments supporting the possibility of fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses rely upon survival of infectious virus following inoculation of various surfaces, high initial amounts of input virus on a surface may generate artificially inflated survival times compared to realistic lower levels of virus that a subject would normally encounter. This is not only because there are extra half-lives to go through at the higher concentrations, but also because the half-lives themselves are extended at the higher virus concentrations. It is important to design surface drying experiments for pathogens with realistic levels of input virus, and to consider the role of the carrier and matrix if the results are to be clinically relevant.

IMPORTANCEDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, a lot of attention has been paid to the environmental decay of SARS-CoV-2 due to proposed transmission of the virus via fomites. However, published experiments have commenced with very high virus titer inoculums, an experimental design not representative of real-life conditions. The study described here evaluated the impact of initial virus titer on environmental decay of an enveloped virus, using a non-pathogenic surrogate for SARS-CoV-2, enveloped bacteriophage Phi6. We establish that higher concentrations of virus can protect the virus from environmental decay, depending on conditions. This has important implications for stability studies of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. Our results point to a limitation in the fundamental methodology that has been used to attribute fomite transmission for almost all respiratory viruses.",NA,131,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.17.444592v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.17.444592v1.full.pdf

Resolution of the COVID-19 pandemic has been advanced by the recent development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, but vaccine efficacy is partly compromised by the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced transmissibility2. The emergence of these variants emphasizes the need for further development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies, especially in aged populations. Here, we describe the isolation of a new set of highly virulent mouse-adapted viruses and use them to test a novel therapeutic drug useful in infections of aged animals. Initially, we show that many of the mutations observed in SARS-CoV-2 during mouse adaptation (at positions 417, 484, 501 of the spike protein) also arise in humans in variants of concern (VOC)2. Their appearance during mouse adaptation indicates that immune pressure is not required for their selection. Similar to the human infection, aged mice infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 develop more severe disease than young mice. In murine SARS, in which severity is also age-dependent, we showed that elevated levels of an eicosanoid, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and of a phospholipase, PLA2G2D, contributed to poor outcomes in aged mice3,4. Using our virulent mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2, we show that infection of middle-aged mice lacking expression of DP1, a PGD2 receptor, or PLA2G2D are protected from severe disease. Further, treatment with a DP1 antagonist, asapiprant, protected aged mice from a lethal infection. DP1 antagonism is one of the first interventions in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals that specifically protects aged animals, and demonstrates that the PLA2G2D-PGD2/DP1 pathway is a useful target for therapeutic interventions.

The receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike protein is one of the promising candidates to develop effective vaccines since it can induce potent neutralizing antibodies. We previously reported the production of RBD in Pichia pastoris and showed it is structurally identical to the protein produced in mammalian HEK-293T cells. In this work we designed an RBD multimer construct with the purpose of increasing RBD immunogenicity. We produced multimeric particles by a transpeptidation reaction between the RBD expressed in P. pastoris and Lumazine Synthase from Brucella abortus (BLS), which is a highly immunogenic and very stable decameric protein of 170 kDa. We vaccinated mice with two doses 30 days apart, and then we measured humoral immune response. When the number of RBD copies coupled to BLS was high (6-7 RBD molecules per BLS decamer, in average), the immune response was significantly better than that elicited by RBD alone or even by RBD-BLS comprising low number of RBD copies (1-2 RBD molecules per BLS decamer). Remarkably, the construct with high number of RBD copies induced high IgG titers with high neutralizing capacity. Furthermore, a superior immune response was observed when Al(OH)3 adjuvant was added to this formulation, exhibiting a higher titer of neutralizing antibodies. Altogether our results suggest that RBD covalent coupled to BLS forming a multimer-particle shows an advantageous architecture to the antigen-presentation to the immune system which enhances immune responses.

In the present communication we compare the influence of overweight and undernutrition in the levels of renal angiotensin converting enzymes 1 and 2. Since the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been implicated in the progress of kidney failure during Covid-19, we also investigated the influence of Angiotensin-(3–4) (Ang-(3–4)) the shortest angiotensin-derived peptide, which is considered the physiological antagonist of several angiotensin II effects. We found that both overweight and undernutrition downregulate the levels of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) without influence on the levels of ACE1 in kidney rats. Administration of Ang-(3–4) recovers the control levels of ACE2 in overweight but not in undernourished rats.

A detailed analysis of the human host response to SARS CoV 2 with expression profiling by high throughput sequencing has executed with primary human lung epithelium cell lines. Clustered genes annotation and gene network construction are performed with the help of String database.

Functional enrichment analysis of genes present in gene network has completed using String database, ToppFun online tool and NetworkAnalyst tool. For SARS CoV2 virus particles, keratin proteins, which are part of cytoskeleton structure of host cell, play a major role in cell to cell virus particle transmission. Among three types of cell- cell communication, only anchoring junction between basal cell membrane and basal lamina, is involved in this virus transmission. In this junction point, hemidesmosome structure play a vital role in virus spread from one cell to basal lamina in respiratory tract. In this protein complex structure, keratin, integrin and laminin proteins of host cell is used to promote the spread of virus infection into extracellular matrix.

The test measures the capacity of serum or purified antibodies to neutralize a recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. This recombinant virus (VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-{Delta}19CT) induces fusion in Vero cell monolayers, which is detected as luciferase signal using a dual split protein (DSP) reporter system. VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-{Delta}19CT infection was blocked by monoclonal -SARS-CoV-2-spike antibodies and by plasma or serum from SARS-CoV-2 convalescing individuals. The assay exhibited 100% specificity in validation tests, and across all tests zero false positives were detected. In blinded analyses of 230 serum samples, only two unexpected results were observed based on available clinical data. We observed a perfect correlation between results from our assay and 80 samples that were also assayed using a commercially available ELISA. To quantify the magnitude of the anti-viral response, we generated a calibration curve by adding stepped concentrations of -SARS-CoV-2-spike monoclonal antibody to pooled SARS-CoV-2 seronegative serum. Using the calibration curve and a single optimal 1:100 serum test dilution, we reliably measured neutralizing antibody levels in each test sample. Virus neutralization units (VNUs) calculated from the assay correlated closely (p < 0.0001) with PRNTEC50 values determined by plaque reduction neutralization test against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the IMMUNO-COV assay accurately quantitates SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in human sera and therefore is a potentially valuable addition to the currently available serological tests. The assay can provide vital information for comparing immune responses to the various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are currently in development, or for evaluating donor eligibility in convalescent plasma therapy studies.",NA,474,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.26.117549v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.26.117549v1.full.pdf

Thus here we collected 2,142 high-quality genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 160 regions in over 50 countries and reconstructed their phylogeny, and also analyzed the interaction between the polymorphisms of spike protein and human ACE2 (hACE2). Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus in other hosts show SARS-CoV-2 is highly possible originated from Bat-CoV (RaTG13) found in horseshoe bat and a recombination event may occur on the spike protein of Pangolin-CoV to imbue it the ability to infect humans. Moreover, compared to the S gene of SARS-CoV-2, it is more conserved in the direct-binding sites of RBD and we noticed that spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 may under a consensus evolution to adapt to human hosts better. 3,860 amino acid mutations in spike protein RBD (T333-C525) of SARS-CoV-2 were simulated and their stability and affinity binding to hACE2 (S19-D615) were calculated.

Raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) are kept for fur production, in particular in China, and were suspected as potential intermediate host for both SARS-CoV6 and SARS-CoV2. Here we demonstrate susceptibility of raccoon dogs for SARS-CoV-2 infection after intranasal inoculation and transmission to direct contact animals. Rapid, high level virus shedding, in combination with minor clinical signs and pathohistological changes, seroconversion and absence of viral adaptation highlight the role of raccoon dogs as a potential intermediate host. The results are highly relevant for control strategies and emphasize the risk that raccoon dogs may represent a potential SARS-CoV-2 reservoir.

Soon after the pandemic was recognized by epidemiologists, a group of biologists comprising the ARTIC Network, has devised a multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol and primer set for targeted whole-genome amplification of SARS-CoV-2. The ARTIC primer set amplifies 98 amplicons, which are separated only in two PCRs, across a nearly entire viral genome. The original primer set and protocol showed a fairly small amplification bias when clinical samples with relatively high viral loads were used. However, when samples viral load was low, several amplicons, especially amplicons 18 and 76, exhibited low coverage or complete dropout. We have determined that these dropouts were due to a dimer formation between the forward primer for amplicon 18, 18_LEFT, and the reverse primer for amplicon 76, 76_RIGHT. Replacement of 76_RIGHT with an alternatively designed primer was sufficient to produce a drastic improvement in coverage of both amplicons. Based on this result, we replaced 12 primers in total in the ARTIC primer set that were predicted to be involved in 14 primer interactions.

Viruses are expected to quickly acquire beneficial mutations upon jumping to a new host species. Advantageous nucleotide substitutions can be identified by their parallel occurrence in multiple independent lineages and are likely to result in changes to protein sequences. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is acquiring mutations more slowly than expected for neutral evolution, suggesting purifying selection is the dominant mode of evolution during the initial phase of the pandemic. However, several parallel mutations arose in multiple independent lineages and may provide a fitness advantage over the ancestral genome. We propose plausible reasons for several of the most frequent mutations. The absence of mutations in other genome regions suggests essential components of SARS-CoV-2 that could be the target of drug development.

Efficiently designing irreversible inhibitors, though, remains challenging. Here, we present covalentizer, a computational pipeline for creating irreversible inhibitors based on complex structures of targets with known reversible binders. For each ligand, we create a custom-made focused library of covalent analogs. We use covalent docking, to dock these tailored covalent libraries and to find those that can bind covalently to a nearby cysteine while keeping some of the main interactions of the original molecule. We found ~11,000 cysteines in close proximity to a ligand across 8,386 protein-ligand complexes in the PDB. Of these, the protocol identified 1,553 structures with covalent predictions. In prospective evaluation against a panel of kinases, five out of nine predicted covalent inhibitors showed IC50 between 155 nM - 4.2 M.

To overcome these limitations, we propose that elucidation and pharmacologic targeting of host cell Master Regulator proteins--whose aberrant activities govern the reprogramed state of infected-coronavirus cells--presents unique opportunities to develop novel mechanism-based therapeutic approaches to antiviral therapy, either as monotherapy or as a complement to established treatments. Specifically, we propose that a small module of host cell Master Regulator proteins (ViroCheckpoint) is hijacked by the virus to support its efficient replication and release. Conventional methodologies are not well suited to elucidate these potentially targetable proteins. By using the VIPER network-based algorithm, we successfully interrogated 12h, 24h, and 48h signatures from Calu-3 lung adenocarcinoma cells infected with SARS-CoV, to elucidate the time-dependent reprogramming of host cells and associated Master Regulator proteins. We used the NYS CLIA-certified Darwin OncoTreat algorithm, with an existing database of RNASeq profiles following cell perturbation with 133 FDA-approved and 195 late-stage experimental compounds, to identify drugs capable of virtually abrogating the virus-induced Master Regulator signature.

Nonhuman primates (NHP) are a useful model for demonstrating whether mRNA-1273 mediates protection against B.1.351.

MethodsNonhuman primates received 30 or 100 {micro}g of mRNA-1273 as a prime-boost vaccine at 0 and 4 weeks, a single immunization of 30 {micro}g at week 0, or no vaccine. Antibody and T cell responses were assessed in blood, bronchioalveolar lavages (BAL), and nasal washes. Viral replication in BAL and nasal swabs were determined by qRT-PCR for sgRNA, and histopathology and viral antigen quantification were performed on lung tissue post-challenge.

ResultsEight weeks post-boost, 100 {micro}g x2 of mRNA-1273 induced reciprocal ID50 neutralizing geometric mean titers against live SARS-CoV-2 D614G and B.1.351 of 3300 and 240, respectively, and 430 and 84 for the 30 {micro}g x2 group. There were no detectable neutralizing antibodies against B.1351 after the single immunization of 30 {micro}g. On day 2 following B.1.351 challenge, sgRNA in BAL was undetectable in 6 of 8 NHP that received 100 {micro}g x2 of mRNA-1273, and there was a [~]2-log reduction in sgRNA in NHP that received two doses of 30 {micro}g compared to controls. In nasal swabs, there was a 1-log10 reduction observed in the 100 {micro}g x2 group. There was limited inflammation or viral antigen in lungs of vaccinated NHP post-challenge.

This has led to speculations that some lineages of SARS-CoV-2 may be evolving towards higher transmissibility. The most plausible candidate mutations under putative natural selection are those which have emerged repeatedly and independently (homoplasies). Here, we formally test whether any of the recurrent mutations that have been observed in SARS-CoV-2 are significantly associated with increased viral transmission. To do so, we develop a phylogenetic index to quantify the relative number of descendants in sister clades with and without a specific allele. We apply this index to a carefully curated set of recurrent mutations identified within a dataset of 46,723 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from patients worldwide. We do not identify a single recurrent mutation in this set convincingly associated with increased viral transmission. Instead, recurrent SARS-CoV-2 mutations currently in circulation appear to be evolutionary neutral. Recurrent mutations also seem primarily induced by the human immune system via host RNA editing, rather than being signatures of adaptation to the novel human host.

The virus having its roots in Wuhan (China) has been spread over the world by its own property to change itself accordingly. These changes correspond to its transmission and pathogenicity due to which the concept of social distancing appeared into the picture. In this paper, a few findings from the whole genome sequence analysis of viral genome sequences submitted from India are presented. The data used for analysis comprises 440 collective genome sequences of virus submitted in GenBank, GISAID, and SRA projects, from around the world as well as 28 viral sequences from India. Multiple sequence alignment of all genome sequences was performed and analysed. A novel non-synonymous mutation 4809C>T (S1515F) in NSP3 gene of SARS-CoV2 Indian strains is reported along with other frequent and important changes from around the world: 3037C>T, 14408C>T, and 23403A>G. The novel change was observed in samples collected in the month of March, whereas was found to be absent in samples collected in January with the respective persons travel history to China. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the sequences with this change as one separate clade. Mutation was predicted as stabilising change by insilco tool DynaMut. A second patient in the world to our knowledge with multiple (Wuhan and USA) strain contraction was observed in this study. The infected person is among the two early infected patients with travel history to China. Strains sequenced in Iran stood out to have different variants, as most of the reported frequent variants were not observed. The objective of this paper is to highlight the similarities and changes observed in the submitted Indian viral strains. This helps to keep track on the activity, that how virus is changing into a new subtype. Major strains observed were European with the novel change in India and other being emergent clade of Iran. Its important to observe the changes in NSP3 gene, as this gene has been reported with extensive positive selection as well as potential drug target.

The development of a unified view and a working model which is consistent with the diverse experimental data is an important focal point of the current work. In this study, we used an integrative computational approach to examine molecular mechanisms underlying functional effects of the D614G mutation by exploring atomistic modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins as allosteric regulatory machines. We combined coarse-grained simulations, protein stability and dynamic fluctuation communication analysis along with network-based community analysis to simulate structures of the native and mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in different functional states. The results demonstrated that the D614 position anchors a key regulatory cluster that dictates functional transitions between open and closed states. Using molecular simulations and mutational sensitivity analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins we showed that the D614G mutation can improve stability of the spike protein in both closed and open forms, but shifting thermodynamic preferences towards the open mutant form. The results offer support to the reduced shedding mechanism of S1 domain as a driver of the increased infectivity triggered by the D614G mutation. Through distance fluctuations communication analysis, we probed stability and allosteric communication propensities of protein residues in the native and mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, providing evidence that the D614G mutation can enhance long-range signaling of the allosteric spike engine. By employing network community analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, our results revealed that the D614G mutation can promote the increased number of stable communities and allosteric hub centers in the open form by reorganizing and enhancing the stability of the S1-S2 inter-domain interactions and restricting mobility of the S1 regions. This study provides atomistic-based view of the allosteric interactions and communications in the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, suggesting that the D614G mutation can exert its primary effect through allosterically induced changes on stability and communications in the residue interaction networks.",NA,173,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.26.428331v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.26.428331v1.full.pdf

Here, we interrogate the transcriptional features and cellular landscapes of the aging human lung through integrative analysis of bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. By intersecting these age-associated changes with experimental data on host interactions between SARS-CoV-2 or its relative SARS-CoV, we identify several age-associated factors that may contribute to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. We observed that age-associated gene expression and cell populations are significantly linked to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. The aging lung is characterized by increased vascular smooth muscle contraction, reduced mitochondrial activity, and decreased lipid metabolism. Lung epithelial cells, macrophages, and Th1 cells decrease in abundance with age, whereas fibroblasts, pericytes and CD4+ Tcm cells increase in abundance with age.

Recent work suggests that only the naive state can give rise to trophectoderm and that primed iPSC generate mixed amnionic and mesoderm lineages. Here we identify conditions that efficiently drive the specification of primed iPSC to trophectoderm, named Trophoblast Stem Cell (TSC). iPS-derived-TSC share transcriptional, morphological and functional characteristics with human in vivo cytotrophoblasts including activation of human endogenous retroviruses, expression of COVID-19 associated host factors and generation of multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts with a large fusion index. At high densities in 5% O2, iPS-derived-TSC form villi-like structures and express extravillous and syncytiotrophoblast proteins HCG-{beta} and HLA-G.

Correlation, concordance, positive percent agreement (PPA), and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated at several cutoffs. Results were compared in patients categorized by clinical outcomes.Results The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer (EC50) and the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays was 0.29, 0.47, and 0.46 respectively. At an EC50 of 1:32, the concordance kappa with Roche was 0.49 (95% CI; 0.23-0.75), with Abbott was 0.52 (0.28-0.77), and with EUROIMMUN was 0.61 (0.4-0.82). At the same neutralizing titer, the PPA and NPA for the Roche was 100% (94-100) &amp; 56% (30-80); Abbott was 96% (88-99) &amp; 69% (44-86); and EUROIMMUN was 91% (80-96) &amp; 81% (57-93) for distinguishing neutralizing antibodies. Patients who died, were intubated, or had a cardiac injury from COVID-19 infection had significantly higher neutralizing titers relative to those with mild symptoms.Conclusion COVID-19 patients generate an antibody response to multiple viral proteins such that the calibrator ratios on the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays are all associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Nevertheless, commercial serological assays have poor NPA for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, making them imperfect proxies for neutralization.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",10.1093/clinchem/hvaa211,590,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.01.182220v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.01.182220v1.full.pdf

However, it is still unclear why it was restricted to higher latitudes during the initial days and later cascaded in the tropics. Here, we analyzed 176 SARS-CoV-2 genomes across different latitudes and climate (Koppens climate) that provided insights about within species virus evolution and its relation to abiotic factors. Two genetically variant groups, named as G1 and G2 were identified, well defined by four mutations. The G1 group (ancestor), is mainly restricted to warm and moist, temperate climate (Koppens C climate) while its descendent G2 group surpasses the climatic restrictions of G1, initially cascading into neighboring cold climate (D) of higher latitudes and later into hot climate of the tropics (A). It appears that the gradation of temperate climate (Cfa-Cfb) to cold climate (Dfa-Dfb) drives the evolution of G1 into G2 variant group which later adapted to tropical climate (A) as well. It seems this virus followed inverse latitudinal gradient in the beginning due to its preference towards temperate (C) and cold climate (D). Our work elucidates virus evolutionary studies combined with climatic studies can provide crucial information about the pathogenesis and natural spreading pathways in such outbreaks which is hard to achieve through individual studies. Mutational insights gained may help design an efficacious vaccine.

SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs endothelial function and induces vascular inflammation, leading to endotheliitis. SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on the binding of Spike glycoprotein (S protein) to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the host cells. We show here that S protein alone can damage vascular endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro and in vivo, manifested by impaired mitochondrial function, decreased ACE2 expression and eNOS activity, and increased glycolysis. The underlying mechanism involves S protein downregulation of AMPK and upregulation of MDM2, causing ACE2 destabilization.

A growing number of studies have focused on immunological determinants to develop better biomarkers for therapies.

AimThe dynamics of the insurgence of immunity is at the core of the both SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and therapies. This paper addresses a fundamental question in the management of the infection: can we describe the insurgence (and the span) of immunity in COVID-19? The in-silico model developed here answers this question at individual (personalized) and population levels.

We simulate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and analyze the impact of infecting viral load, affinity to the ACE2 receptor and age in the artificially infected population on the course of the disease.

MethodsWe use a stochastic agent-based immune simulation platform to construct a virtual cohort of infected individuals with age-dependent varying degree of immune competence. We use a parameter setting to reproduce known inter-patient variability and general epidemiological statistics.

ResultsWe reproduce in-silico a number of clinical observations and we identify critical factors in the statistical evolution of the infection. In particular we evidence the importance of the humoral response over the cytotoxic response and find that the antibody titers measured after day 25 from the infection is a prognostic factor for determining the clinical outcome of the infection.

Our modeling framework uses COVID-19 infection to demonstrate the actionable effectiveness of simulating the immune response at individual and population levels. The model developed is able to explain and interpret observed patterns of infection and makes verifiable temporal predictions.

Within the limitations imposed by the simulated environment, this work proposes in a quantitative way that the great variability observed in the patient outcomes in real life can be the mere result of subtle variability in the infecting viral load and immune competence in the population.

In this work we i) show the power of model predictions, ii) identify the clinical end points that could be more suitable for computational modeling of COVID-19 immune response, iii) define the resolution and amount of data required to empower this class of models for translational medicine purposes and, iv) we exemplify how computational modeling of immune response provides an important view to discuss hypothesis and design new experiments, in particular paving the way to further investigations about the duration of vaccine-elicited immunity especially in the view of the blundering effect of immunesenescence.",NA,51,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.20.423670v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.20.423670v2.full.pdf

The active form of remdesivir acts as a nucleoside analogue and inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-25-7. Remdesivir is incorporated by the RdRp into the growing RNA product and allows for addition of three more nucleotides before RNA synthesis stalls6,8. Here we use synthetic RNA chemistry, biochemistry and cryo-electron microscopy to establish the molecular mechanism of remdesivir-induced RdRp stalling. We show that addition of the fourth nucleotide following remdesivir incorporation into the RNA product is impaired by a barrier to further RNA translocation. This translocation barrier causes retention of the RNA 3-nucleotide in the substrate-binding site of the RdRp and interferes with entry of the next nucleoside triphosphate, thereby stalling RdRp. In the structure of the remdesivir-stalled state, the 3-nucleotide of the RNA product is matched with the template base, and this may prevent proofreading by the viral 3-exonuclease that recognizes mismatches9,10.

No approved vaccine yet exists for any form of coronavirus. Here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell and B-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties. These epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies. We identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles, and two potential neutralizing B-cell epitopes near the 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor binding domain (440-460 and 494-506). Analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding-change mutations. These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good MHC-I presentation scores (p=0.02). No mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain. Based on these findings, the spike protein is likely immunogenic and a potential vaccine candidate. We validated our computational pipeline with SARS-CoV experimental data.

Significance StatementThe novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has affected more than 100 countries and continues to spread. There is an immediate need for effective vaccines that contain antigens which trigger responses from human T-cells and B-cells (known as epitopes). Here we identify potential T-cell epitopes through an analysis of human antigen presentation, as well as B-cell epitopes through an analysis of protein structure. We identify a list of top candidates, including an epitope located on 2019-nCoV spike protein that potentially triggers both T-cell and B-cell responses. Analyzing 68 samples, we observe that viral mutations are more likely to happen in regions with strong antigen presentation, a potential form of immune evasion.

Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these novel viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent 2019-nCoV, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor.

Angiotensin II (Ang II) peptide, which has a naturally high affinity for ACE2, may be useful in inhibiting this interaction. In this study, we computationally designed several Ang II mutants to find a strong binding sequence to ACE2 receptor and examined the role of ligand substitution in the docking of native as well as mutant Ang II to the ACE2 receptor. The peptide in the ACE2-peptide complex was coordinated to zinc in the ACE2 cleft. Exploratory molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to measure the time-based stability of the native and mutant peptides and their receptor complexes. The MD-generated root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values are mostly similar between the native and seven mutant peptides considered in this work, although the values for free peptides demonstrated higher variation, and often were higher in amplitude than peptides associated with the ACE2 complex. An observed lack of a strong secondary structure in the short peptides is attributed to the latters greater flexibility and movement. The strongest binding energies within the ACE2-peptide complexes were observed in the native Ang II and only one of its mutant variants, suggesting ACE2 cleft is designed to provide optimal binding to the native sequence. An examination of the S1 binding site on ACE2 suggests that complex formation alone with these peptides may not be sufficient to allosterically inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins.

We have developed a mass-spectrometry based method for the detection of the SARS CoV-2 virus in nasopharynx epithelial swabs, based on the detection of the viral nucleocapsid N protein.

We identified a number of transcriptional programs that are altered across the spectrum of disease severity, few of which are common between the lung and peripheral immune environments. In the lung, comparing severe and moderate patients revealed severity-specific responses of enhanced interferon, A20/I{kappa}B, IL-2, and IL-6 pathway signatures along with broad signaling activity of IFNG, SPP1, CCL3, CCL8, and IL18 across cell types. These signatures contrasted with features unique to ARDS observed in the blood compartment, which included depletion of interferon and A20/I{kappa}B signatures and a lack of IL-6 response. The cell surface marker S1PR1 was strongly upregulated in patients diagnosed with ARDS compared to non-ARDS patients in {gamma}{delta} T cells of the blood compartment, and we nominate S1PR1 as a potential marker for immunophenotyping ARDS in COVID-19 patients using flow cytometry.

Despite that there have been emergently approved vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have remained rising. Thus, rapid diagnosis and necessary public health measures are still key parts to contain the pandemic. In this study, the colorimetric isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests (iNAATs) for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), cross-priming amplification (CPA), and polymerase spiral reaction (PSR) were designed and evaluated. The three methods showed the same limit of detection (LOD) value of 1 copy of the targeted gene per reaction. However, for the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic-RNA, LAMP outperformed both CPA and PSR, exhibiting the LOD value of roughly 43.14 genome copies/reaction. The results can be read with the naked eye within 45 minutes, without cross-reactivity to closely related coronaviruses. Moreover, the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in simulated patient specimens by iNAATs was also successful. Finally, the ready-to-use lyophilized reagents for LAMP reactions were shown to maintain the sensitivity and LOD value of the liquid assays.

Severe and not mild infection correlated with high titers of IgG against Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that were capable of viral inhibition. B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing revealed two VH genes, VH3-38 and VH3-53, that were enriched during severe infection. Of the 22 antibodies cloned from two severe donors, six exhibited potent neutralization against live SARS-CoV-2, and inhibited syncytia formation. Using peptide libraries, competition ELISA and RBD mutagenesis, we mapped the epitopes of the neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) to three different sites on the Spike. Finally, we used combinations of nAbs targeting different immune-sites to efficiently block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of 49 healthy BCR repertoires revealed that the nAbs germline VHJH precursors comprise up to 2.7% of all VHJHs.

PIMT-TS showed the lowest percentage of lymphocytes and monocytes with higher relative numbers of CD4+ (p =0,000). At the same time, we describe a differential expression of CD64, CD11a and CD11b. Monocytes and neutrophils in PIMS-TS showed higher levels of CD64 expression compared to all groups (p = 0,000). Also, proteins involved in leukocyte tissue migration, like CD11a and CD11b were highly expressed compare to other severe viral or bacterial infections (p = 0,000). In PIMS-TS this increased CD11a expression could be a sign of the activation and trafficking of these leukocytes. These findings are congruent with an inflammatory process and the trend of these cells to leave the bloodstream. In conclusion, we compare for the first time the innate cellular response of children with PIMS-TS with other severe forms of viral or bacterial infection and Kawasaki disease.

We performed sequence and structural analyses to explore how antibody features correlate with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Cryo-EM structures of 910-30 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer revealed its binding interactions and ability to disassemble spike. Despite heavy chain sequence similarity, biophysical analyses of IGHV3-53/3-66 antibodies highlighted the importance of native heavy:light pairings for ACE2 binding competition and for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. We defined paired heavy:light sequence signatures and determined antibody precursor prevalence to be ~1 in 44,000 human B cells, consistent with public antibody identification in several convalescent COVID-19 patients.

We have previously studied the use of semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives as drug candidates for inhibition of cancer, fibrosis, and bone regeneration. In this study, we have screened a panel of naturally occurring and semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, using a cell culture infection assay. We show that the natural oxysterols, 7-ketocholesterol, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol, substantially inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation in cultured cells. Among semi-synthetic oxysterols, Oxy186 displayed antiviral activity comparable to natural oxysterols. In addition, related oxysterol analogues Oxy210 and Oxy232 displayed more robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities, reducing viral replication more than 90% at 10 M and 99% at 15 M, respectively. When orally administered in mice, peak plasma concentrations of Oxy210 fall into a therapeutically relevant range (19 M), based on the dose-dependent curve for antiviral activity in our cell culture infection assay. Mechanistic studies suggest that Oxy210 reduced replication of SARS-CoV-2 with disrupting the formation of double membrane vesicles (DMVs), intracellular membrane compartments associated with viral replication. Oxy210 also inhibited the replication of hepatitis C virus, another RNA virus whose replication is associated with DMVs, but not the replication of the DMV-independent hepatitis D virus.

Interestingly, the majority of individuals have low neutralization capacity and only 6% of the healthcare workers showed high neutralizing titers against both authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus and the pseudotyped virus. We found the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection generates antigen-specific isotypes as well as a diverse combination of antibody isotypes, with high titers of IgG, IgM and IgA against both antigens correlating with neutralization capacity. Importantly, we found that neutralization correlated with antibody titers as quantified by ELISA. This suggests that an ELISA assay can be used to determine seroneutralization potential.

In this study, we developed an approach for sequencing the region encoding the SARS-CoV-2 virion surface proteins from large numbers of individual virus RNA genomes per sample. We applied this approach to the WA-1 reference clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 passaged in vitro and to upper respiratory samples from 7 study participants with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from cell culture were diverse, including 18 haplotypes with non-synonymous mutations clustered in the spike NH2-terminal domain (NTD) and furin cleavage site regions. By contrast, cross-sectional analysis of samples from participants with COVID-19 showed fewer virus variants, without structural clustering of mutations. However, longitudinal analysis in one individual revealed 4 virus haplotypes bearing 3 independent mutations in a spike NTD epitope targeted by autologous antibodies. These mutations arose coincident with a 6.2-fold rise in serum binding to spike and a transient increase in virus burden. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a capacity for rapid genetic adaptation that becomes detectable in vivo with the onset of humoral immunity, with the potential to contribute to delayed virologic clearance in the acute setting.

Author SummaryMutant sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) arising during any individual case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could theoretically enable the virus to evade immune responses or antiviral therapies that target the predominant infecting virus sequence. However, commonly used sequencing technologies are not optimally designed to detect variant virus sequences within each sample. To address this issue, we developed novel technology for sequencing large numbers of individual SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA molecules across the region encoding the virus surface proteins. This technology revealed extensive genetic diversity in cultured viruses from a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2, but lower diversity in samples from 7 individuals with COVID-19. Importantly, concurrent analysis of paired serum samples in selected individuals revealed relatively low levels of antibody binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at the time of initial sequencing. With increased serum binding to spike protein, we detected multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants bearing independent mutations in a single epitope, as well as a transient increase in virus burden. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 replication creates sufficient virus genetic diversity to allow immune-mediated selection of variants within the time frame of acute COVID-19. Large-scale studies of SARS-CoV-2 variation and specific immune responses will help define the contributions of intra-individual SARS-CoV-2 evolution to COVID-19 clinical outcomes and antiviral drug susceptibility.",NA,131,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.21.432184v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.21.432184v1.full.pdf

In these animal models, SARS-CoV-2 infection results in viral replication and a mild disease disease. Therefore, the protective efficacy of the vaccine in these animals is commonly evaluated by its ability to elicit immunologic responses, diminish viral replication and prevent weight loss.

While the global source sink dynamics of the different seasonal influenza viruses have been studied intensively, its local spread remains less clear. In order to improve our understanding of how influenza is transmitted on a city scale, we collected an extremely densely sampled set of influenza sequences alongside patient metadata. To do so, we sequenced influenza viruses isolated from patients of two different hospitals, as well as private practitioners in Basel, Switzerland during the 2016/2017 influenza season. The genetic sequences reveal that repeated introductions into the city drove the influenza season. We then reconstruct how the effective reproduction number changed over the course of the season. We find trends in transmission dynamics correlated positively with trends in temperature, but not relative humidity nor school holidays. Alongside the genetic sequence data that allows us to see how individual cases are connected, we gathered patient information, such as the age or household status. Zooming into the local transmission outbreaks suggests that the elderly were to a large extent infected within their own transmission network, while school children likely drove the spread within the remaining transmission network. These patterns will be valuable to plan interventions combating the spread of respiratory diseases within cities given that similar patterns are observed for other influenza seasons and cities.

Author summaryAs shown with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, respiratory diseases can quickly spread around the globe. While it can be hugely important to understand how diseases spread around the globe, local spread is most often the main driver of novel infections of respiratory diseases such as SARS-CoV-2 or influenza.

The genetic sequence data allows us to reconstruct the how the transmission dynamics changed over the course of the season, which we correlate to changes, but not humidity or school holidays. Additionally, the genetic sequence data allows us to see how individual cases are connected.

To aid global efforts focusing on SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting, we report exploratory results from frameshifting and cellular replication experiments with locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), which support the FSE as a therapeutic target but highlight difficulties in achieving strong inactivation.

This variation is derived from discontinuous subgenomic RNA synthesis where the polymerase switches template from a 3 proximal genome body sequence to a 5 untranslated leader sequence. This leads to a fusion between the common 5 leader sequence and a 3 proximal body sequence in the RNA product. This process revolves around a common core sequence (CS) that is present at both the template sites that make up the fusion junction. Base-pairing between the leader CS and the nascent complementary minus strand body CS, and flanking regions (together called the transcription regulating sequence, TRS) is vital for this template switching event. However, various factors can influence the site of template switching within the same TRS duplex. Here, we model the duplexes formed between the leader and complementary body TRS regions, hypothesising the role of the stability of the TRS duplex in determining the major sites of template switching for the most abundant mRNAs.

Monocytes are heterogeneous and characterized by three distinct subsets in humans. Classical and non-classical monocytes represent the most abundant subsets, each carrying out distinct biological functions. Consequently, altered frequencies of different subsets have been associated with inflammatory conditions, such as infections and autoimmune disorders including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and, more recently, COVID-19. Dissecting the contribution of different monocyte subsets to disease is currently limited by samples and cohorts, often resulting in underpowered studies and, consequently, poor reproducibility. Public transcriptomes provide an alternative source of data characterized by high statistical power and real world heterogeneity. However, most transcriptome datasets profile bulk blood or tissue samples, requiring the use of in silico approaches to quantify changes in the levels of specific cell types.

Here, we integrated 853 publicly available microarray expression profiles of sorted human monocyte subsets from 45 independent studies to identify robust and parsimonious gene expression signatures, consisting of 10 genes specific to each subset. These signatures, although derived using only datasets profiling healthy individuals, maintain their accuracy independent of the disease state in an independent cohort profiled by RNA-sequencing (AUC = 1.0). Furthermore, we demonstrate that our signatures are specific to monocyte subsets compared to other immune cells such as B, T, dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells (AUC = 0.87~0.88, p<2.2e-16). This increased specificity results in estimated monocyte subset levels that are strongly correlated with cytometry-based quantification of cellular subsets (r = 0.69, p = 6.7e-4). Consequently, we show that these monocyte subset-specific signatures can be used to quantify changes in monocyte subsets levels in expression profiles from patients in clinical trials. Finally, we show that proteins encoded by our signature genes can be used in cytometry-based assays to specifically sort monocyte subsets.

Transcriptional profiling studies found that infected pHAE cultures had a molecular signature dominated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine induction, including IL-6, TNF, CXCL8. We also identified NF-{kappa}B and ATF4 transcription factors as key drivers of this pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Surprisingly, we observed a complete lack of a type I or III IFN induction during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pre-treatment or post-treatment with type I and III IFNs dramatically reduced virus replication in pHAE cultures and this corresponded with an upregulation of antiviral effector genes. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 induces a strong pro-inflammatory cytokine response yet blocks the production of type I and III IFNs. Further, SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to the effects of type I and III IFNs, demonstrating their potential utility as therapeutic options to treat COVID-19 patients.

IMPORTANCEThe current pandemic of respiratory illness, COVID-19, is caused by a recently emerged coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. This virus infects airway and lung cells causing fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Severe cases of COVID-19 can result in lung damage, low blood oxygen levels, and even death. As there are currently no vaccines or antivirals approved for use in humans, studies of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary human airway epithelial cultures induces a strong pro-inflammatory cytokine response yet blocks the production of type I and III IFNs. Further, SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to the effects of type I and III IFNs, demonstrating their potential utility as therapeutic options to treat COVID-19 patients.",10.1128/jvi.00985-20,355,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.105437v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.105437v1.full.pdf

Unfolding curves revealed that the frameshift signal formed multiple different structures: at least two distinct pseudoknotted conformers with different unfolding forces and energy barriers, as well as alternative stem-loop structures. Refolding curves showed that stem 1 formed first in the pseudoknotted conformers, followed by stem 3 and then stem 2.

Here, using ribosome profiling in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, we identify structural elements that regulate viral gene expression, alternative translation initiation events, as well as host responses regulated by mRNA translation. We found that the ribosome density was low within the SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting element but high immediately downstream, which suggests the utilization of a highly efficient ribosomal frameshifting strategy. In SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, although many chemokine, cytokine and interferon stimulated genes were upregulated at the mRNA level, they were not translated efficiently, suggesting a translational block that disarms host innate host responses.

Several emerging variants have shown decreased susceptibility to neutralization by vaccine induced immunity, most notably the B.1.351 variant, although the overall impact on vaccine efficacy remains to be determined. Here, we present the initial evaluation in mice of two updated COVID-19 mRNA vaccines designed to target emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants: (1) monovalent mRNA-1273.351 encodes for the S protein found in the B.1.351 lineage and (2) mRNA-1273.211 comprising a 1:1 mix of mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351. Both vaccines were evaluated as a 2-dose primary series in mice; mRNA-1273.351 was also evaluated as a booster dose in animals previously vaccinated with 2-doses of mRNA-1273.

PurposeThe objective of this study is to investigate whether CQ and HCQ could be ACE2 blockers and used to inhibit 2019-nCoV virus infection.

MethodsIn our study, we used CCK-8 staining, flow cytometry and immunofluorescent staining to evaluate the toxicity and autophagy of CQ and HCQ, respectively, on ACE2 high-expressing HEK293T cells (ACE2h cells). We further analyzed the binding character of CQ and HCQ to ACE2 by molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays, 2019-nCoV spike pseudotyped virus was also used to observe the viropexis effect of CQ and HCQ in ACE2h cells.

ResultsResults showed that HCQ is slightly more toxic to ACE2h cells than CQ. Both CQ and HCQ could bind to ACE2 with KD =(7.31{+/-}0.62)e-7 M and (4.82{+/-}0.87)e-7 M, respectively. They exhibit equivalent suppression effect for the entrance of 2019-nCoV spike pseudotyped virus into ACE2h cells.

Recent cell-based analyses of SARS-CoV-2 protein - protein interactions have mapped the human proteins targeted by the virus. The DNA polymerase  - primase complex or primosome - responsible for initiating DNA synthesis in genomic duplication - was identified as a target of nsp1 (non structural protein 1), a major virulence factor in the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Here, we report the biochemical characterisation of the interaction between nsp1 and the primosome and the cryoEM structure of the primosome - nsp1 complex. Our data provide a structural basis for the reported interaction between the primosome and nsp1. They suggest that Pol  - primase plays a part in the immune response to the viral infection, and that its targeting by SARS-CoV-2 aims to interfere with such function.",NA,47,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.17.448816v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.17.448816v1.full.pdf

These symptoms and the associated laboratory values strongly resemble toxic shock syndrome, an escalation of the cytotoxic adaptive immune response triggered upon the binding of pathogenic superantigens to MHCII molecules and T cell receptors (TCRs). Here, we used structure-based computational models to demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) exhibits a high-affinity motif for binding TCR, interacting closely with both the - and {beta}-chains variable domains complementarity-determining regions. The binding epitope on S harbors a sequence motif unique to SARS-CoV-2 (not present in any other SARS coronavirus), which is highly similar in both sequence and structure to bacterial superantigens. Further examination revealed that this interaction between the virus and human T cells is strengthened in the context of a recently reported rare mutation (D839Y/N/E) from a European strain of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the interfacial region includes selected residues from a motif shared between the SARS viruses from the 2003 and 2019 pandemics, which has intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-like character. These data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 S may act as a superantigen to drive the development of MIS-C as well as cytokine storm in adult COVID-19 patients, with important implications for the development of therapeutic approaches.

SignificanceAlthough children have been largely spared from severe COVID-19 disease, a rare hyperinflammatory syndrome has been described in Europe and the East Coast of the United States, termed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MISC). The symptoms and diagnostic lab values of MIS-C resemble those of toxic shock, typically caused by pathogenic superantigens stimulating excessive activation of the adaptive immune system. We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike has a sequence and structure motif highly similar to those of bacterial superantigens, and may directly bind to the T cell receptors. This sequence motif, not present in other coronaviruses, may explain the unique potential for SARS-CoV-2 to cause both MIS-C and the cytokine storm observed in adult COVID-19 patients.",10.1073/pnas.2010722117,487,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.109272v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.109272v1.full.pdf

The molecular evolution in nine genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed using three different approaches: phylogenetic signal assessment, emergence of amino acid substitutions, and Bayesian evolutionary rate estimation in eight successive fortnights since the virus emergence.

All observed phylogenetic signals were very low and trees topologies were in agreement with those signals. However, after four months of evolution, it was possible to identify regions revealing an incipient viral lineages formation despite the low phylogenetic signal, since fortnight 3.

In June 2020, all African countries registered human infections with SARS-CoV-2.

The virus is mutating steadily and this is monitored by a well curated database of viral nucleotide sequences from samples taken from infected individual thus enabling phylogenetic analysis and phenotypic associations.

MethodsWe downloaded from the GISAID database, SARS-CoV-2 sequences established from four West African countries Ghana, Gambia, Senegal and Nigeria and then performed phylogenetic analysis employing the nextstrain pipeline. Based on mutations found within the sequences we calculated and visualized statistics characterizing clades according to the GISAID nomenclature.

ResultsWe found country-specific patterns of viral clades: the later Europe-associated G-clades predominantly in Senegal and Gambia, and combinations of the earlier (L, S, V) and later clades in Ghana and Nigeria. Contrary to our expectations, the later Europe-associated G-clades emerged before the earlier clades. Detailed analysis of distinct samples showed that some of the earlier clades might have circulated latently and some reflect migration routes via Mali and Tunisia.

ConclusionsThe distinct patterns of viral clades in the West African countries point at its emergence from Europe and China via Asia and Europe. The observation that the later clades emerged before the earlier clades could be simply due to founder effects or due to latent circulation of the earlier clades. Only a marginal correlation of the G-clades associated with the D614G mutation could be identified with the relatively low case fatality (0.6-3.2).

The spike protein (S) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells1. The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar2, but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-CoV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-23. Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced Betacoronaviruses to reveal that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant shared by SARS and SARS-Cov2 with two completely-conserved key functional features, an ion-channel and a PDZ-binding Motif (PBM). These features trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)4-6, the leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection7,8. However, three drugs approved for human use may inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Protein E, either acting upon the ion channel (Amantadine and Hexamethylene amiloride9,10) or the PBM (SB2035805), thereby potentially increasing the survival of the host, as already demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1in animal models. Hence, blocking the SARS protein E inhibits development of ARDS in vivo. Given that our results demonstrate that the protein E subcluster for the SARS clade is quasi-identical for the key functional regions of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, we conclude that use of approved drugs shown to act as SARS E protein inhibitors can help prevent further casualties from COVID-2019 while vaccines and other preventive measures are being developed.",10.3389/fcimb.2020.00405,108,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.952895v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.952895v2.full.pdf

We fortuitously found that C3A was more susceptible to human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 infection than HepG2, which was attributed to the increased efficiency of virus entry into C3A cells. In an effort to search for the host cellular protein(s) mediating the differential susceptibility of the two cell lines to HCoV-OC43 infection, we found that ADAP2, GILT and LY6E, three cellular proteins with known activity of interfering virus entry, expressed at significantly higher levels in HepG2 cells. Functional analyses revealed that ectopic expression of LY6E, but not GILT or ADAP2, in HEK 293 cells inhibited the entry of HCoV-OC43. While overexpression of LY6E in C3A and A549 cells efficiently inhibited the infection of HCoV-OC43, knockdown of LY6E expression in HepG2 significantly increased its susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection. Moreover, we found that LY6E also efficiently restricted the entry mediated by the envelope spike proteins of other human coronaviruses, including the currently pandemic SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, overexpression of serine protease TMPRSS2 or amphotericin treatment significantly neutralized the IFITM3 restriction of human coronavirus entry, but did not compromise the effect of LY6E on the entry of human coronaviruses. The work reported herein thus demonstrates that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis via a distinct mechanism.

ImportanceVirus entry into host cells is one of the key determinants of host range and cell tropism and is subjected to the control by host innate and adaptive immune responses. In the last decade, several interferon inducible cellular proteins, including IFITMs, GILT, ADAP2, 25CH and LY6E, had been identified to modulate the infectious entry of a variety of viruses. Particularly, LY6E was recently identified as host factors to facilitate the entry of several human pathogenic viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A virus and yellow fever virus. Identification of LY6E as a potent restriction factor of coronaviruses expands the biological function of LY6E and sheds new light on the immunopathogenesis of human coronavirus infection.",10.1128/JVI.00562-20,413,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.021469v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.021469v1.full.pdf

SARS-CoV-1 mutates frequently because of its RNA genome, which challenges the antiviral development. Here, we performed computational saturation mutagenesis of the S protein of SARS-CoV-1 to identify the residues crucial for its functions. We used the structure-based energy calculations to analyze the effects of the missense mutations on the SARS-CoV-1 S stability and the binding affinity with hACE2. The sequence and structure alignment showed similarities between the S proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, we found that target mutations of S protein amino acids generate similar effects on their stabilities between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. For example, G839W of SARS-CoV-1 corresponds to G857W of SARS-CoV-2, which decrease the stability of their S glycoproteins. The viral mutation analysis of the two different SARS-CoV-1 isolates showed that mutations, T487S and L472P, weakened the S-hACE2 binding of the 2003-2004 SARS-CoV-1 isolate. In addition, the mutations of L472P and F360S destabilized the 2003-2004 viral isolate. We further predicted that many mutations on N-linked glycosylation sites would increase the stability of the S glycoprotein. Our results can be of therapeutic importance in the design of antivirals or vaccines against SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.

Author SummarySevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) is an RNA virus that undergoes frequent mutations, which may result in more virulent SARS-CoV-1 variants. To prevent another pandemic in the future, scientists must understand the mechanisms of viral mutations and predict if any variants could become a dominant. The infection of SARS-CoV-1 in cells is largely depending on the interactions of the viral Spike (S) and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). We applied a computational method to predict S missense mutations that will make SARS-CoV-1 more virulent. We are interested in the variants that can change SARS-CoV-1 spike protein stability and/or change the virus-receptor interactions. We mutated each residue of SARS-CoV-1 spike to all possible amino acids; we calculated the differences between the folding energy and binding energy of each variant and the wildtype and identified the target S mutations with significant effects on protein stability and protein-protein interaction. We found some viral mutations could destabilize S and weaken S-hACE2 binding of SARS-CoV-1 isolate. Our results show that the computational saturation mutagenesis is a reliable approach in the analysis and prediction of missense mutations.",NA,315,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.30.450547v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.30.450547v1.full.pdf

A key symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the onset of fever, with a hyperthermic temperature range of 38 to 41{degrees}C. Fever is an evolutionarily conserved host response to microbial infection and inflammation that can influence the outcome of viral pathogenicity and regulation of host innate and adaptive immune responses. However, it remains to be determined what effect elevated temperature has on SARS-CoV-2 tropism and replication. Utilizing a 3D air-liquid interface (ALI) model that closely mimics the natural tissue physiology and cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory airway, we identify tissue temperature to play an important role in the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show that temperature elevation induces wide-spread transcriptome changes that impact upon the regulation of multiple pathways, including epigenetic regulation and lncRNA expression, without disruption of general cellular transcription or the induction of interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral immune defences. Respiratory tissue incubated at temperatures >37{degrees}C remained permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection but severely restricted the initiation of viral transcription, leading to significantly reduced levels of intraepithelial viral RNA accumulation and apical shedding of infectious virus. To our knowledge, we present the first evidence that febrile temperatures associated with COVID-19 inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our data identify an important role for temperature elevation in the epithelial restriction of SARS-CoV-2 that occurs independently of the induction of canonical IFN-mediated antiviral immune defences and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression.",NA,380,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.04.411389v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.04.411389v1.full.pdf

Here we used a comprehensive library of mammalian carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) to probe critical sugar residues on the full-length trimeric Spike and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Two lectins, Clec4g and CD209c, were identified to strongly bind to Spike. Clec4g and CD209c binding to Spike was dissected and visualized in real time and at single molecule resolution using atomic force microscopy. 3D modelling showed that both lectins can bind to a glycan within the RBD-ACE2 interface and thus interferes with Spike binding to cell surfaces. Importantly, Clec4g and CD209c significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 infections. These data report the first extensive map and 3D structural modelling of lectin-Spike interactions and uncovers candidate receptors involved in Spike binding and SARS-CoV-2 infections.

AimWe tested Norway rats inhabiting the sewer system of Antwerp, Belgium, for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 following a local COVID-19 epidemic peak. In addition, we discuss the use and interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests on non-human samples.

MethodsBetween November and December 2020, Norway rat oral swabs, feces and tissues from the sewer system of Antwerp were collected to be tested by RT-qPCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Serum samples were screened for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using a Luminex microsphere immunoassay (MIA). Samples considered positive were then checked for neutralizing antibodies using a conventional viral neutralization test (cVNT).

ResultsThe serum of 35 rats was tested by MIA showing 3 potentially positive sera that were later shown to be negative by cVNT. All tissue samples of 39 rats analyzed tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

ConclusionThis is the first study that evaluates SARS-CoV-2 infection in urban rats. We can conclude that the sample of 39 rats had never been infected with SARS-CoV-2.

In addition to respiratory complications as a result of SARS-CoV-2 illness, accumulating evidence suggests that neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated with the disease caused by the virus. In this study, we investigated the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 stimulation on neuroinflammation in BV-2 microglia. Analyses of culture supernatants revealed an increase in the production of TNF, IL-6, IL-1{beta} and iNOS/NO. SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 increased protein expressions of phospho-p65 and phospho-I{kappa}B, as well as enhancing DNA binding and transcriptional activity of NF-{kappa}B. Pro-inflammatory effects of the glycoprotein effects were reduced in the presence of BAY11-7082 (1 M). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 in BV-2 microglia increased the protein expression of NLRP3, as well as caspase-1 activity. However, pre-treatment with CRID3 (1 M) or BAY11-7082 (1 M) resulted in the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome/caspase-1. It was also observed that CRID3 attenuated SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1-induced increase in IL-1{beta} production. Increased protein expression of p38 MAPK was observed in BV-2 microglia stimulated with the spike glycoprotein S1, and was reduced in the presence of SKF 86002. These results have provided the first evidence demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 glycoprotein-induced neuroinflammation in BV-2 microglia. We propose that promotion of neuroinflammation by this glycoprotein is mediated through activation of NF-{kappa}B, NLRP3 inflammasome and p38 MAPK.

Ever since the start of SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19 pandemic, countless uncertainties have been revolving around the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. While air pollution has been shown to be strongly correlated to increased SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality, whether environmental pollutants such as ground level ozone affects the susceptibility of individuals to SARS-CoV-2 is not yet established.

ObjectiveTo investigate the impact of ozone inhalation on the expression levels of signatures associated with host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsWe analyzed lung tissues collected from mice that were sub-chronically exposed to air or 0.8ppm ozone for three weeks (4h/night, 5 nights/week), and analyzed the expression of signatures associated with host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells requires proteolytic priming by the host-derived protease, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). The TMPRSS2 protein and Tmprss2 transcripts were significantly elevated in the extrapulmonary airways, parenchyma, and alveolar macrophages from ozone-exposed mice. A significant proportion of additional known SARS-CoV-2 host susceptibility genes were upregulated in alveolar macrophages and parenchyma from ozone-exposed mice.

ConclusionsOur data indicate that the unhealthy levels of ozone in the environment may predispose individuals to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the severity of this pandemic, and the challenges associated with direct testing of host-environment interactions in clinical settings, we believe that this mice-ozone-exposure based study informs the scientific community of the potentially detrimental effects of the ambient ozone levels determining the host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.",NA,496,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.10.377408v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.10.377408v1.full.pdf

Blocking this interaction provides a potent approach to preventing and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, the ability of {beta}-chitosan to block the binding interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and ACE2 was investigated. The inhibitory effect of {beta}-chitosan on inflammation induced by the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD was also studied. Native-PAGE analysis indicated that {beta}-chitosan could bind with ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and a conjugate of {beta}-chitosan and ACE2 could no longer bind with the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD. HPLC analysis suggested that a conjugate of {beta}-chitosan and the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD displayed high binding affinity without dissociation under high pressure (40 MPa) compared with that of {beta}-chitosan and ACE2. Furthermore, immunofluorescent staining of Vero E6 cells and lungs from hACE2 mice showed that the presence of {beta}-chitosan prevented SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD from binding to ACE2. Meanwhile, {beta}-chitosan could dramatically suppress the inflammation caused by the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD both in vitro and vivo. Moreover, the decreased expression of ACE2 caused by {beta}-chitosan treatment was restored by addition of TAPI-1, an inhibitor of the transmembrane protease ADAM17. Our findings demonstrated that {beta}-chitosan displays an antibody-like function capable of neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and effectively preventing the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2. Moreover, ADAM17 activation induced by {beta}-chitosan treatment can enhance the cleavage of the extracellular domain of ACE2, releasing the active ectodomain into the extracellular environment, which can prevent the binding, internalization, and degradation of ACE2 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and thus diminish inflammation.

The research revealed 32 G>U and 16 G>U/A mutations located within the S2M sequence in human SARS-CoV-2 models. These polymorphisms appear to make the S2M secondary and tertiary structures in human SARS-CoV-2 models less stable when compared to the S2M structures of bat/pangolin models. This grants the RNA structures more flexibility, which could be one of its escape mechanisms from host defenses or facilitate its entry into host proteins and enzymes.

We aimed to identify and characterize genes that are co-expressed with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and to further explore their biological functions and potential as druggable targets.METHODS Using the gene expression profiles of 1,038 lung tissue samples, we performed a weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of co-expressed genes. We explored the biology of co-expressed genes using bioinformatics databases, and identified known drug-gene interactions.RESULTS ACE2 was in a module of 681 co-expressed genes; 12 genes with moderate-high correlation with ACE2 (r&gt;0.3, FDR&lt;0.05) had known interactions with existing drug compounds. TMPRSS2 was in a module of 1,086 co-expressed genes; 15 of these genes were enriched in the gene ontology biologic process ‘Entry into host cell’, and 53 TMPRSS2-correlated genes had known interactions with drug compounds.CONCLUSION Dozens of genes are co-expressed with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, many of which have plausible links to COVID-19 pathophysiology. Many of the co-expressed genes are potentially targetable with existing drugs, which may help to fast-track the development of COVID-19 therapeutics.Competing Interest StatementS.M. reports personal fees from Novartis and Boehringer-Ingelheim, outside the submitted work.

Here, we introduce  weighted-nearest neighbor analysis, an unsupervised framework to learn the relative utility of each data type in each cell, enabling an integrative analysis of multiple modalities. We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of hundreds of thousands of human white blood cells alongside a panel of 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. We demonstrate that integrative analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states and validate the presence of previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets, and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and COVID-19. Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to analyze single-cell multimodal datasets, including paired measurements of RNA and chromatin state, and to look beyond the transcriptome towards a unified and multimodal definition of cellular identity.

As the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is cleaved into the S1 and the S2 domain by furin protease, Nrp1 binds to the newly created C-terminal RRAR amino acid sequence of the S1 domain. In this study, we model the association of a Nrp1 (a2-b1-b2) protein with the Spike protein computationally and analyze the topological constraints in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein for binding with Nrp1 and ACE2. Importantly, we study the exit mechanism of S2 from the S1 domain with the assistance of ACE2 as well as Nrp1 by molecular dynamics pulling simulations. In the presence of Nrp1, by binding the S1 more strongly to the host membrane, there is a high probability of S2 being pulled out, rather than S1 being stretched. Thus, Nrp1 binding could stimulate the exit of S2 from the S1 domain, which will likely increase virus infectivity as the liberated S2 domain mediates the fusion of virus and host membranes. Understanding of such a Nrp1-assisted viral infection opens the gate for the generation of protein-protein inhibitors, such as antibodies, which could attenuate the infection mechanism and protect certain cells in a future combination therapy.",NA,50,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.06.425627v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.06.425627v2.full.pdf

Studying the evolution and transmission patterns in different countries is crucial to implement effective strategies for disease control and prevention. In this work, we present the full genome sequence for 17 SARS-CoV-2 isolates corresponding to the earliest sampled cases in Mexico. Global and local phylogenomics, coupled with mutational analysis, consistently revealed that these viral sequences are distributed within 2 known lineages, the SARS-CoV-2 lineage A/G, containing mostly sequences from North America, and the lineage B/S containing mainly sequences from Europe. Based on the exposure history of the cases and on the phylogenomic analysis, we characterized fourteen independent introduction events. Additionally, three cases with no travel history were identified. We found evidence that two of these cases represent local transmission cases occurring in Mexico during mid-March 2020, denoting the earliest events described in the country. Within this Mexican cluster, we also identified an H49Y amino acid change in the spike protein. This mutation is a homoplasy occurring independently through time and space, and may function as a molecular marker to follow on any further spread of these viral variants throughout the country. Our results depict the general picture of the SARS-CoV-2 variants introduced at the beginning of the outbreak in Mexico, setting the foundation for future surveillance efforts.

IMPORTANCEUnderstanding the introduction, spread and establishment of SARS-CoV-2 within distinct human populations is crucial to implement effective control strategies as well as the evolution of the pandemics. In this work, we describe that the initial virus strains introduced in Mexico came from Europe and the United States and the virus was circulating locally in the country as early as mid-March.

Many epithelial changes are driven by the type 2 cytokine IL-13, but the effects of IL-13 on SARS-CoV-2 infection are unknown.

ObjectivesWe sought to discover how IL-13 and other cytokines affect expression of genes encoding SARS-CoV-2-associated host proteins in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and determine whether IL-13 stimulation alters susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsWe used bulk and single cell RNA-seq to identify cytokine-induced changes in SARS-CoV-2-associated gene expression in HBECs. We related these to gene expression changes in airway epithelium from individuals with mild-moderate asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We analyzed effects of IL-13 on SARS-CoV-2 infection of HBECs.

Measurements and Main ResultsTranscripts encoding 332 of 342 (97%) SARS-CoV-2-associated proteins were detected in HBECs ([&ge;]1 RPM in 50% samples). 41 (12%) of these mRNAs were regulated by IL-13 (>1.5-fold change, FDR < 0.05). Many IL-13-regulated SARS-CoV-2-associated genes were also altered in type 2 high asthma and COPD. IL-13 pretreatment reduced viral RNA recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and decreased dsRNA, a marker of viral replication, to below the limit of detection in our assay. Mucus also inhibited viral infection.

ConclusionsIL-13 markedly reduces susceptibility of HBECs to SARS-CoV-2 infection through mechanisms that likely differ from those activated by type I interferons. Our findings may help explain reports of relatively low prevalence of asthma in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and could lead to new strategies for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection.",NA,195,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.25.432762v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.25.432762v1.full.pdf

The envelope (E) protein, one of four structural proteins encoded in the viral genome, is a 75-residue integral membrane protein whose transmembrane domain exhibits ion channel activity and whose cytoplasmic domain participates in protein-protein interactions. These activities contribute to several aspects of the viral replication-cycle, including virion assembly, budding, release, and pathogenesis. Here, we describe the structure and dynamics of full-length SARS-CoV-2 E protein in hexadecylphosphocholine micelles by NMR spectroscopy. We also characterized its interactions with four putative ion channel inhibitors. The chemical shift index and dipolar wave plots establish that E protein consists of a long transmembrane helix (residues 8-43) and a short cytoplasmic helix (residues 53-60) connected by a complex linker that exhibits some internal mobility. The conformations of the N-terminal transmembrane domain and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain are unaffected by truncation from the intact protein. The chemical shift perturbations of E protein spectra induced by the addition of the inhibitors demonstrate that the N-terminal region (residues 6-18) is the principal binding site. The binding affinity of the inhibitors to E protein in micelles correlates with their antiviral potency in Vero E6 cells: HMA {approx} EIPA > DMA >> Amiloride, suggesting that bulky hydrophobic groups in the 5 position of the amiloride pyrazine ring play essential roles in binding to E protein and in antiviral activity. An N15A mutation increased the production of virus-like particles, induced significant chemical shift changes from residues in the inhibitor binding site, and abolished HMA binding, suggesting that Asn15 plays a key role in maintaining the protein conformation near the binding site. These studies provide the foundation for complete structure determination of E protein and for structure-based drug discovery targeting this protein.

Author SummaryThe novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the world-wide pandemic of COVID-19, has become one of the greatest threats to human health. While rapid progress has been made in the development of vaccines, drug discovery has lagged, partly due to the lack of atomic-resolution structures of the free and drug-bound forms of the viral proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) protein, with its multiple activities that contribute to viral replication, is widely regarded as a potential target for COVID-19 treatment. As structural information is essential for drug discovery, we established an efficient sample preparation system for biochemical and structural studies of intact full-length SARS-CoV-2 E protein and characterized its structure and dynamics. We also characterized the interactions of amilorides with specific E protein residues and correlated this with their antiviral activity during viral replication. The binding affinity of the amilorides to E protein correlated with their antiviral potency, suggesting that E protein is indeed the likely target of their antiviral activity. We found that residue asparagine15 plays an important role in maintaining the conformation of the amiloride binding site, providing molecular guidance for the design of inhibitors targeting E protein.",NA,210,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.06.438579v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.06.438579v1.full.pdf

These observations open up an obvious question about the rate and direction of mutational pressure for further vaccine and therapeutics designing. In this study, we did a comparative analysis of ORF1a and ORF1b by using the first isolate (Wuhan strain) as the parent sequence. We observed that most of the nucleotide mutations are C to U transitions. The rate of synonymous C to U transitions is significantly higher than the rate of nonsynonymous ones, indicating negative selection on amino acid substitutions. Further, trends in nucleotide usage bias have been investigated in 49 coronaviruses species. A strong bias in nucleotide usage in fourfold degenerated sites towards uracil residues is seen in ORF1 of all the studied coronaviruses. A more substantial mutational U pressure is observed in ORF1a than in ORF1b owing to the translation of ORF1ab via programmed ribosomal frameshifting. Unlike other nucleotide mutations, mutational U pressure caused by cytosine deamination, mostly occurring in the RNA-plus strand, cannot be corrected by the proof-reading machinery of coronaviruses.

SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike protein, in particular the receptor binding domain (RBD), to bind human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry, and thus targeting RBD holds the promise for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, a competitive biopanning strategy of a phage display antibody library was applied to screen blocking antibodies against RBD. High-affinity antibodies were enriched after the first round using a standard panning process in which RBD-His recombinant protein was immobilized as a bait. At the next two rounds, immobilized ACE2-Fc and free RBD-His proteins were mixed with the enriched phage antibodies. Antibodies binding to RBD at epitopes different from ACE2-binding site were captured by the immobilized ACE2-Fc, forming a ""sandwich"" complex. Only antibodies competed with ACE2 for recognizing RBD at the same or similar epitopes can bind to the free RBD-His in the supernatant and be subsequently separated by the Ni-NTA magnetic beads. Top 1 lead from the competitive biopanning of a synthetic antibody library, Lib AB1, was produced as the full-length IgG1 format.

Several Mpro inhibitors have been reported with potent enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral activity, including GC376, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, each containing a reactive warhead that covalently modifies the catalytic Cys145. In this study, we report an expedited drug discovery approach by coupling structure-based design and Ugi four-component (Ugi-4CR) reaction methodology to the design of non-covalent Mpro inhibitors. The most potent compound 23R had cellular antiviral activity similar to covalent inhibitors such as GC376. Our designs were guided by overlaying the structure of SARS-CoV Mpro + ML188 (R), a non-covalent inhibitor derived from Ug-4CR, with the X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro + calpain inhibitor XII/GC376/UAWJ247. Binding site analysis suggests a strategy of extending the P2 and P3 substitutions in ML188 (R) to achieve optimal shape complementary with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Lead optimization led to the discovery of 23R, which inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV-2 viral replication with an IC50 of 0.31 M and EC50 of 1.27 M, respectively. The binding and specificity of 23R to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro were confirmed in a thermal shift assay and native mass spectrometry assay. The co-crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with 23R revealed the P2 biphenyl fits snuggly into the S2 pocket and the benzyl group in the -methylbenzyl faces towards the core of the enzyme, occupying a previously unexplored binding site located in between the S2 and S4 pockets.

As a result, there is a critical need for rapid and continuously updated access to the latest molecular data in a format in which all data can be quickly cross-referenced and compared. We adapted our genome browser visualization tool to the viral genome for this purpose. Molecular data, curated from published studies or from database submissions, are mapped to the viral genome and grouped together into ""annotation tracks"" where they can be visualized along the linear map of the viral genome sequence and programmatically downloaded in standard format for analysis.

ResultsThe UCSC Genome Browser for SARS-CoV-2 (https://genome.ucsc.edu/covid19.html) provides continuously updated access to the mutations in the many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in GISAID and the international nucleotide sequencing databases, displayed alongside phylogenetic trees. These data are augmented with alignments of bat, pangolin, and other animal and human coronavirus genomes, including per-base evolutionary rate analysis. All available annotations are cross-referenced on the virus genome, including those from major databases (PDB, RFAM, IEDB, UniProt) as well as up-to-date individual results from preprints. Annotated data include predicted and validated immune epitopes, promising antibodies, RT-PCR and sequencing primers, CRISPR guides (from research, diagnostics, vaccines, and therapies), and points of interaction between human and viral genes. As a community resource, any user can add manual annotations which are quality checked and shared publicly on the browser the next day.

ConclusionsWe invite all investigators to contribute additional data and annotations to this resource to accelerate research and development activities globally. Contact us at genome-www@soe.ucsc.edu with data suggestions or requests for support for adding data.

Unlike RT-qPCR, SARS-CoV-2 Whole Genome Sequencing (cWGS) has the added advantage of identifying cryptic origins of the virus, and the extent of community-based transmissions versus new viral introductions, which can in turn influence public health policy decisions. However, practical and cost considerations of cWGS should be addressed before it can be widely implemented.

MethodsWe performed shotgun transcriptome sequencing using RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs of patients with COVID-19, and compared it to targeted SARS-CoV-2 full genome amplification and sequencing with respect to virus detection, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. To track virus origin, we used open-source multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tools to compare the assembled SARS-CoV-2 genomes to publicly available sequences.

ResultsWe show a significant improvement in whole genome sequencing data quality and viral detection using amplicon-based target enrichment of SARS-CoV-2. With enrichment, more than 99% of the sequencing reads mapped to the viral genome compared to an average of 0.63% without enrichment. Consequently, a dramatic increase in genome coverage was obtained using significantly less sequencing data, enabling higher scalability and significant cost reductions. We also demonstrate how SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences can be used to determine their possible origin through phylogenetic analysis including other viral strains.

These severe cases are often associated with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and low antiviral responses which can lead to systemic complications. We have evaluated transcriptional and cytokine secretion profiles from infected cell cultures and detected a distinct upregulation of inflammatory cytokines that parallels samples taken from infected patients. Building on these observations, we found a specific activation of NF-{kappa}B and a block of IRF3 nuclear translocation in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.

Here, we report our study on allosteric communication within RBD that propagates the signal from ACE2-binding site towards allosteric site for the post-binding activation of proteolytic cleavage. Using MD simulations, we have demonstrated allosteric crosstalk within RBD in apo- and receptor-bound states where dynamic correlated motions and electrostatic energy perturbations contribute. While allostery, based on correlated motions, dominates inherent distal communication in apo-RBD, electrostatic energy perturbations determine favorable crosstalk within RBD upon binding to ACE2. Notably, allosteric path is constituted with evolutionarily conserved residues pointing towards their biological relevance. As revealed from recent structures, in the trimeric arrangement of spike, RBD of one copy interacts with S2 domain of another copy. Interestingly, the allosteric site identified is in direct contact (H-bonded) with a region in RBD that corresponds to the interacting region of RBD of one copy with S2 of another copy in trimeric constitution.

To this end, we created a construct expressing recombinant N fused to a N-terminal maltose binding protein tag which helps keep the oligomeric N soluble for purification.

In the course of comparing the results of both tests, we found that the standard RT-qPCR test can have low detection efficiency (less than 50%) in a real testing scenario which may be only partly explained by low viral representation in many samples. This finding points to the importance of directly monitoring detection efficiency in test environments.

Expanding testing capabilities to conduct population-wide screening for COVID-19 requires innovation in diagnostic services at both the molecular and industrial scale. No report to-date has considered the complexity of laboratory infrastructure in conjunction with the available molecular assays to offer a standardised solution to testing. Here we present CONTAIN. A modular biosafety level 2+ laboratory optimised for automated RT-qPCR COVID-19 testing based on a standard 40ft shipping container. Using open-source liquid-handling robots and RNA extraction reagents we demonstrate a reproducible workflow for RT-qPCR COVID-19 testing. With five OT2 liquid handlers, a single CONTAIN unit reaches a maximum daily testing capacity of 2400 tests/day. We validate this workflow for automated RT-qPCR testing, using both synthetic SARS-CoV-2 samples and patient samples from a local NHS hospital. Finally, we discuss the suitability of CONTAIN and its flexibility in a range of diagnostic testing scenarios including high-density urban environments and mobile response units.

Many results have been described on the status of the immune system of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, but there are still aspects that have not been fully characterized. In this study, we have analyzed a cohort of patients with mild, moderate and severe disease. We performed flow cytometric studies and correlated the data with the clinical features and clinical laboratory values of patients. Both conventional and unsupervised data analyses concluded that patients with severe disease are characterized, among others, by a higher state of activation in all T cell subsets, higher expression of perforin and granzyme B in cytotoxic cells, expansion of adaptive NK cells and the accumulation of activated and immature dysfunctional monocytes which are identified by a low expression of HLA-DR and an intriguing abrupt change in the expression pattern of CD300 receptors. More importantly, correlation analysis showed a strong association between the alterations in the immune cells and the clinical signs of severity. These results indicate that patients with severe COVID-19 have a broad perturbation of their immune system, and they will help to understand the immunopathogenesis of severe COVID-19 as well as could be of special value for physicians to decide which specific therapeutic options are most effective for their patients.",10.3389/fimmu.2021.655934,486,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.22.423917v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.22.423917v1.full.pdf

Here, we develop single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) that potently disrupt the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2. By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we identified a panel of nanobodies that bind to multiple epitopes on Spike and block ACE2 interaction via two distinct mechanisms. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one exceptionally stable nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains (RBDs) locked into their inaccessible down-state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains stability and function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment.

Due to the sporadic nature of spillover events and limited availability of data, developing and validating robust, spatially explicit, predictions is challenging. Recent efforts have begun to make progress in this direction by capitalizing on machine learning methodologies. An important weakness of existing approaches, however, is that they generally rely on combining human and reservoir infection data during the training process and thus conflate risk attributable to the prevalence of the pathogen in the reservoir population with the risk attributed to the realized rate of spillover into the human population. Because effective planning of interventions requires that these components of risk be disentangled, we developed a multi-layer machine learning framework that separates these processes. Our approach begins by training models to predict the geographic range of the primary reservoir and the subset of this range in which the pathogen occurs. The spillover risk predicted by the product of these reservoir specific models is then fit to data on realized patterns of historical spillover into the human population. The result is a geographically specific spillover risk forecast that can be easily decomposed and used to guide effective intervention. Applying our method to Lassa virus, a zoonotic pathogen that regularly spills over into the human population across West Africa, results in a model that explains a modest but statistically significant portion of geographic variation in historical patterns of spillover. When combined with a mechanistic mathematical model of infection dynamics, our spillover risk model predicts that 897,700 humans are infected by Lassa virus each year across West Africa, with Nigeria accounting for more than half of these human infections.

Author SummaryThe 2019 emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is a grim reminder of the threat animal-borne pathogens pose to human health. Even prior to SARS-CoV-2, the spillover of pathogens from animal reservoirs was a persistent problem, with pathogens such as Ebola, Nipah, and Lassa regularly but unpredictably causing outbreaks. Machine-learning models that anticipate when and where pathogen transmission from animals to humans is likely to occur would help guide surveillance efforts and preemptive countermeasures like information campaigns or vaccination programs. We develop a novel machine learning framework that uses datasets describing the distribution of a virus within its host and the range of its animal host, along with data on spatial patterns of human immunity, to infer rates of animal-to-human transmission across a region. By training the model on data from the animal host alone, our framework allows rigorous validation of spillover predictions using human data. We apply our framework to Lassa fever, a viral disease of West Africa that is spread to humans by rodents, and use the predictions to update estimates of Lassa virus infections in humans. Our results suggest that Nigeria is most at risk for the emergence of Lassa virus, and should be prioritized for outbreak-surveillance.",10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008811,8,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.979658v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.979658v3.full.pdf

This stems from the heterogenous response of individuals to disease which is also reflected in the inter-individual variability of gene expression responses. This in turn obscures differential gene expression analysis (DGE). In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, we wondered whether an alternative to DGE approaches could be applied to dissect the molecular nature of a host-response to infection exemplified here by an analysis of H1N1 influenza, community/hospital acquired pneumonia (CAP) and sepsis. To this end, we turned to the analysis of ensemble gene noise. Ensemble gene noise, as we defined it here, represents a variance within an individual for a collection of genes encoding for either members of known biological pathways or subunits of annotated protein complexes. From the law of total variance, ensemble gene noise depends on the stoichiometry of the ensemble genes expression and on their average noise (variance). Thus, rather than focusing on specific genes, ensemble gene noise allows for the holistic identification and interpretation of gene expression disbalance on the level of gene networks and systems. Comparing H1N1, CAP and sepsis patients we spotted common disturbances in a number of pathways/protein complexes relevant to the sepsis pathology which lead to an increase in the ensemble gene noise. Among others, these include mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and peroxisomes which could be readily targeted for adjuvant treatment by methylene blue and 4-phenylbutyrate respectively. Finally, we showed that ensemble gene noise could be successfully applied for the prediction of clinical outcome, namely mortality, of CAP and sepsis patients. Thus, we conclude that ensemble gene noise represents a promising approach for the investigation of molecular mechanisms of a pathology through a prism of alterations in coherent expression of gene circuits.",NA,474,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.035717v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.035717v1.full.pdf

SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cell receptor, TMPRSS2 protease, and FURIN peptidase to invade human cells. Here, we investigated 1,378 whole-exome sequences of individuals from the Middle Eastern populations (Kuwait, Qatar, and Iran) to explore natural variations in the ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN genes. We identified two activating variants (K26R and N720D) in the ACE2 gene that are more common in Europeans than in the Middle Eastern, East Asian, and African populations. We postulate that K26R can activate ACE2 and facilitate binding to S-protein RBD while N720D enhances TMPRSS2 cutting and, ultimately, viral entry. We also detected deleterious variants in FURIN that are frequent in the Middle Eastern but not in the European populations.

Aiming to overcome these problems, we present DeepEMhancer, a deep learning approach designed to perform automatic post-processing of cryo-EM maps. Trained on a dataset of pairs of experimental maps and maps sharpened using their respective atomic models, DeepEMhancer has learned how to post-process experimental maps performing masking-like and sharpening-like operations in a single step.

Using computational modeling approach, this study resolved the evolutionary pattern of bonding affinity of ACE2 in 247 jawed vertebrates to the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. First, high-or-low binding affinity phenotype divergence of ACE2 to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has appeared in two ancient species of jawed vertebrates, Scyliorhinus torazame (low-affinity, Chondrichthyes) and Latimeria chalumnae (high-affinity, Coelacanthimorpha). Second, multiple independent affinity divergence events recur in fishes, amphibians-reptiles, birds, and mammals. Third, high affinity phenotypes go up in mammals, possibly implying the rapid expansion of mammals might accelerate the evolution of coronaviruses. Fourth, we found natural mutations at eight amino acid sites of ACE2 can determine most of phenotype divergences of bonding affinity in 247 vertebrates and resolved their related structural basis.

Here, we develop novel severe disease animal models for COVID-19 involving disruption of adaptive immunity in Syrian hamsters. Cyclophosphamide (CyP) immunosuppressed or RAG2 knockout (KO) hamsters were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by the respiratory route. Both the CyP-treated and RAG2 KO hamsters developed clinical signs of disease that were more severe than in immunocompetent hamsters, notably weight loss, viral loads, and fatality (RAG2 KO only). Disease was prolonged in transiently immunosuppressed hamsters and uniformly lethal in RAG2 KO hamsters. We evaluated the protective efficacy of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody and found that pretreatment, even in immunosuppressed animals, limited infection.

However, as soon as the vaccines were released - the only scientifically verified and efficient therapeutic option thus far - a few mutations combined into variants of SARS-CoV-2 that are more transmissible and virulent emerged raising doubts about their efficiency. Therefore, this work aims to explain possible molecular mechanisms responsible for the increased transmissibility and the increased rate of hospitalizations related to the new variants. A combination of theoretical methods was employed. Constant-pH Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to quantify the stability of several spike trimeric structures at different conformational states and the free energy of interactions between the receptor binding domain (RBD) and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) for the most worrying variants. Electrostatic epitopes were mapped using the PROCEEDpKa method. These analyses showed that the increased virulence is more likely to be due to the improved stability to the S trimer in the opened state (the one in which the virus can interact with the cellular receptor ACE2) than due to alterations in the complexation RBD-ACE2, once the increased observed in the free energy values is small. Conversely, the South African variant (B.1.351), when compared with the wild type SARS-CoV-2, is much more stable in the opened state (either with one or two RBDs in the up position) than in the closed state (with the three RBDs in the down position). Such results contribute to the understanding of the natural history of disease and also to indicate possible strategies to both develop new therapeutic molecules and to adjust the vaccine doses for a higher production of B cells antibodies.

Despite its relevance, there is scarce information about its evolutionary traces. The aim of this study was to investigate the diversification patterns of the spike for each clade of SARS-CoV-2 through different approaches.

MethodsTwo thousand and one hundred sequences representing the seven clades of the SARS-CoV-2 were included. Patterns of genetic diversifications and nucleotide evolutionary rate were estimated for the spike genomic region.

ResultsThe haplotype networks showed a star shape, where multiple haplotypes with few nucleotide differences diverge from a common ancestor. Four hundred seventy nine different haplotypes were defined in the seven analyzed clades. The main haplotype, named Hap-1, was the most frequent for clades G (54%), GH (54%), and GR (56%) and a different haplotype (named Hap-252) was the most important for clades L (63.3%), O (39.7%), S (51.7%), and V (70%). The evolutionary rate for the spike protein was estimated as 1.08 x 10-3 nucleotide substitutions/site/year. Moreover, the nucleotide evolutionary rate after nine months of pandemic was similar for each clade.

ConclusionsIn conclusion, the present evolutionary analysis is relevant since the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the target for most therapeutic candidates; besides, changes in this protein could have consequences on viral transmission, response to antivirals and efficacy of vaccines.

We performed studies in mice to understand how the priming dose of a SARS CoV-2 vaccine affects long-term immunity to SARS CoV-2. We first primed C57BL/6 mice with an adenovirus-based vaccine encoding SARS CoV-2 spike protein (Ad5-SARS-2 spike), similar to that used in the CanSino and Sputnik V vaccines. This prime was administered either at a low dose (LD) of 106 PFU or at a standard dose (SD) of 109 PFU, followed by a SD boost in all mice four weeks later. As expected, the LD prime induced lower immune responses relative to the SD prime. However, the LD prime elicited immune responses that were qualitatively superior, and upon boosting, mice that were initially primed with a LD exhibited significantly more potent immune responses.

These maps are available on our WormFlux website. We show that WormPaths provides easy-to-navigate maps and that the different levels in WormPaths can be used for metabolic pathway enrichment analysis of transcriptomic data. In the unfortunate event of additional lockdowns, we envision further developing these maps to be more interactive, with an analogy of road maps that are available on mobile devices.",NA,545,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.22.424026v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.22.424026v1.full.pdf

ARDS results from injury to the alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) barrier; clinical recovery requires epithelial regeneration. During physiologic regeneration, AEC2s proliferate, exit the cell cycle, and transiently assume a transitional state before differentiating into AEC1s; transitional cells persist with ineffectual AEC1 differentiation in pulmonary fibrosis. It is unknown why transitional cells differentiate into AEC1s during physiologic regeneration but persist with ensuing scar in fibrosis and whether incomplete AEC1 differentiation from transitional cells without fibrosis may underlie prolonged respiratory failure in COVID-19 ARDS. Immunostaining of postmortem COVID-19 ARDS lungs revealed abundant transitional cells. They were typically cuboidal or partially spread, occasionally flat, but rarely expressed AEC1 markers. They formed organized monolayers on alveolar septa without fibrosis. Immunostaining and/or meta-analysis of scRNAseq datasets revealed that transitional cells in two mouse models of physiologic regeneration, COVID-19 ARDS, and fibrosis express markers of cell cycle exit but only in fibrosis express a specific senescence marker. These data suggest that in COVID-19 ARDS, physiologic AEC1 differentiation from transitional cells is incomplete, thus underlying prolonged barrier permeability and respiratory failure, but as in physiologic regeneration, is ongoing without fibrosis.",NA,36,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.12.426404v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.12.426404v3.full.pdf

Tests must include fail-safe controls that affirmatively report the presence of intact RNA and demonstrate success of all steps of the assay. A result of ""no virus signal"" is insufficient for clinical interpretation: controls must also say ""The reaction worked as intended and would have found virus if present."" Unfortunately, a widely used test specified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) incorporates a control that does not perform as intended and claimed. Detecting SARS-CoV-2 with this assay requires both intact RNA and successful reverse transcription. The CDC-specified control does not require either of these, due to its inability to differentiate human genomic DNA from reverse-transcribed RNA. Patient DNA is copurified from nasopharyngeal swabs during clinically-approved RNA extraction and is sufficient to return an ""extraction control success"" signal using the CDC design. As such, this assay fails-unsafe: truly positive patient samples return a false-negative result of ""no virus detected, control succeeded"" following any of several readily-encountered mishaps. This problem affects tens-of-millions of patients worth of shipped assays, but many of these flawed reagents have not yet been used. There is an opportunity to improve this important diagnostic tool. As demonstrated here, a re-designed transcript-specific control correctly monitors sample collection, extraction, reverse transcription, and qPCR detection.

In the virions the RNA is protected by viral capsid proteins, membrane proteins and nucleocapsid proteins. To overcome this protection we set out to construct RNase fusion with human ACE2 receptor N-terminal domain (ACE2NTD). We constructed six proteins expressed in E. coli cells: 1) MBP-ACE2NTD, 2) ACE2NTD-GFP, 3) RNase I (6xHis), 4) RNase III (6xHis), 5) RNase I-ACE2NTD (6xHis), and 6) human RNase A-ACE2NTD150 (6xHis). We evaluated fusion expression in different E. coli strains, partially purified MBP-ACE2NTD protein from the soluble fraction of bacterial cell lysate, and refolded MBP-ACE2NTD protein from inclusion body. The engineered RNase I-ACE2NTD (6xHis) and hRNase A-ACE2NTD (6xHis) fusions are active in cleaving COVID-19 RNA in vitro. The recombinant RNase I (6xHis) and RNase III (6xHis) are active in cleaving RNA and dsRNA in test tube. This study provides a proof-of-concept for construction of fusion protein between human cell receptor and nuclease that may be used to degrade viral nucleic acids in our environment.

Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus.

MethodsPutative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.

ResultsOur analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3-part spanning 24,341-30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch.

ConclusionsThe levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus.

Mechanistically, we showed that simeprevir inhibits the main protease (Mpro) and unexpectedly the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Our results thus reveal the viral protein targets of simeprevir, and provide preclinical rationale for the combination of simeprevir and remdesivir for the pharmacological management of COVID-19 patients.

The disease has caused a global pandemic, leading to deaths of thousands of people across the world and thus finding origin of this novel coronavirus is important in responding and controlling the pandemic. Recent research results suggest that bats or pangolins might be the hosts for SARS-CoV-2 based on comparative studies using its genomic sequences. This paper investigates the SARS-CoV-2 origin by using artificial intelligence (AI) and raw genomic sequences of the virus. More than 300 genome sequences of COVID-19 infected cases collected from different countries are explored and analysed using unsupervised clustering methods. The results obtained from various AI-enabled experiments using clustering algorithms demonstrate that all examined SARS-CoV-2 genomes belong to a cluster that also contains bat and pangolin coronavirus genomes. This provides evidence strongly supporting scientific hypotheses that bats and pangolins are probable hosts for SARS-CoV-2.

However, currently available applications for network visualization are not suited to understand the COVID-19 epidemic spatiotemporally, due to functional limitations That motivated us to develop Haplotype Explorer, an intuitive tool for visualizing and exploring haplotype networks. Haplotype Explorer enables people to dissect epidemiological consequences via interactive node filters to provide spatiotemporal perspectives on multimodal spectra of infectious diseases, including introduction, outbreak, expansion, and containment, for given regions and time spans.

A safe and effective vaccine is desperately needed to prevent the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2; yet, rational vaccine design efforts are currently hampered by the lack of knowledge regarding viral epitopes targeted during an immune response, and the need for more in-depth knowledge on betacoronavirus immunology. To that end, we developed a computational workflow using a series of open-source algorithms and webtools to analyze the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 and identify putative T cell and B cell epitopes. Using increasingly stringent selection criteria to select peptides with significant HLA promiscuity and predicted antigenicity, we identified 41 potential T cell epitopes (5 HLA class I, 36 HLA class II) and 6 potential B cell epitopes, respectively. Docking analysis and binding predictions demonstrated enrichment for peptide binding to HLA-B (class I) and HLA-DRB1 (class II) molecules. Overlays of predicted B cell epitopes with the structure of the viral spike (S) glycoprotein revealed that 4 of 6 epitopes were located in the receptor-binding domain of the S protein. To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively analyze all 10 (structural, non-structural and accessory) proteins from SARS-CoV-2 using predictive algorithms to identify potential targets for vaccine development.

Significance StatementThe novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 recently emerged from China, rapidly spreading and ushering in a global pandemic. Despite intensive research efforts, our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 immunology and the proteins targeted by the immune response remains relatively limited, making it difficult to rationally design candidate vaccines. We employed a suite of bioinformatic tools, computational algorithms, and structural modeling to comprehensively analyze the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome for potential T cell and B cell epitopes.

Here, we characterized the TCR repertoire of MIS-C patients and found a profound expansion of TCR Beta Variable gene (TRBV)11-2. Furthermore, TRBV11-2 skewing was remarkably correlated with MIS-C severity and serum cytokine levels. Further analysis of TRBJ gene usage and CDR3 length distribution of MIS-C expanding TRBV11-2 clones revealed extensive junctional diversity, indicating a superantigen-mediated selection process for TRBV expansion.

The N-glycan structure and composition of this glycoprotein influence how the virus interacts with host cells.Objective To identify a putative N-glycan biosynthesis pathway of SARS-CoV-2 (HEK293 cell recombinant) from previously published mass spectrometric studies, and to identify what effect blocking some enzymes has on the overall glycoprotein profile. Finally, our goal was to provide the biosynthesis network, and glycans in easy-to-use format for further glycoinformatics work.Methods We reconstructed the glycosylation network based on previously published empirical data using GNAT, a glycosylation network analysis tool. Our compilation of the network tool had 23 glycosyltransferase and glucosidase enzymes, and could infer the pathway of glycosylation machinery based on glycans identified in the virus spike protein. Once the glycan biosynthesis pathway was generated, we simulated the effect of blocking specific enzymes - Mannosidase-II and alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase to see how they would affect the biosynthesis network.Results Of the 23 enzymes, a total of 12 were involved in glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 - Man-Ia, MGAT1, MGAT2, MGAT4, MGAT5, B4GalT, B4GalT, Man II, SiaT, ST3GalI, ST3GalVI and FucT8. Blocking enzymes resulted in a substantially modified glycan profile of the protein.Conclusions A network analysis of N-glycan biosynthesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein shows an elaborate enzymatic pathway with several intermediate glycans, along with the ones identified by mass spectrometric studies. Variations in the final N-glycan profile of the virus, given its site-specific microheterogeneity, could be a factor in the host response to the infection and response to antibodies.

Inspired by the Kolmogorov complexity concept, we propose a generative complexity (algorithmic) framework capable to analyze the viral RNA sequences by mapping the multiscale nucleotide dependencies onto a state machine, where states represent subsequences of nucleotides and state-transition probabilities encode the higher order interactions between these states. We apply computational learning and classification techniques to identify the active state-transitions and use those as features in clade classifiers to decipher the transient mutations (still evolving within a clade) and stable mutations (typical to a clade). As opposed to current analysis tools that rely on the edit distance between sequences and require sequence alignment, our method is computationally local, does not require sequence alignment and is robust to random errors (substitution, insertions and deletions).

This allowed institutions to continue their instruction despite not being in person. However, ERT is not without consequences. For example, students may have inadequate technological supports, such as reliable internet and computers. Students may also have poor learning environments at home and may need to find added employment to support their families. Additionally, there were consequences to faculty. It has been shown that female instructors are more disproportionately impacted in terms of mental health issues and increased domestic labor.

This research aims to investigate instructors and students perceptions of their transition to ERT. Specifically, we wanted to: O_LIIdentify supports and barriers during the transition to ERT
C_LIO_LICompare instructors experiences with the student experiences
C_LIO_LIExplore these supports and barriers within the context of social presence, teaching presence, and/or cognitive presence during ERT as well as how these supports and barriers relate to scaffolding in emergency remote courses
C_LI

DesignUsing grounded theory techniques, we applied two-cycle, qualitative analyses to assess the instructor transcripts. In first-cycle analysis, we used open coding to develop initial ideas from the data. We then used second cycle coding to generate categories with definitions and criteria agreed upon during discussion-based consensus building. Finally, these categories and descriptions were used to code student survey data.

Analyses/InterpretationsInstructors identified twice as many barriers as supports in their teaching during the transition to ERT and identified casual and formal conversations with colleagues as valuable supports. Emerging categories for barriers consisted of academic integrity concerns as well as technological difficulties. Similarly, students identified more barriers than supports in their learning during the transition to ERT. More specifically, students described pre-existing course structure, classroom technology, and community as best supporting their learning. Barriers that challenged student learning included classroom environment, student availability, and student emotion and comfort.

ContributionTogether, this research will help us understand supports and barriers to teaching and learning during the transition to ERT. This understanding can help us better plan and prepare for future emergencies, particularly at MSIs, where improved communication and increased access to resources for both students and instructors are key.",NA,55,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.21.449058v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.21.449058v1.full.pdf

These viruses belong to two lineages: one from Guangdong (GD/P) and the other from Guangxi (GX/P). The GD/P viruses are particularly intriguing as the amino-acid sequence of the receptor binding domain of the spike protein is very similar to that of the human SARS-CoV-2 virus (97.4%)2. This characteristic suggests that GD/P viruses are capable of binding human ACE2 receptor and may therefore be able to mediate infection of human cells. Whereas all six GX/P genomes were deposited as annotated sequences in GenBank, none of the two GD/P genomes assembled in previous studies2,3 are currently available. To overcome this absence, I assembled these genomes from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data available for SARS-CoV-2-like viruses detected in five captive pangolins from Guangdong. I found the genome assemblies of GD/P virus of poor quality, having high levels of missing data. Additionally, unexpected reads in the Illumina sequencing data were identified. The GD/P2S dataset2 contains reads that are identical to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting either the coexistence of two SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the same pangolin or contamination by the human virus. In the four other GD/P datasets1 many mitochondrial reads from pangolin were identified, as well as from three other species, namely, human, mouse and tiger. Importantly, I only identified three polymorphic nucleotide sites between the five GD/P sequences. Such low levels of polymorphism may reasonably be accounted for by sequencing errors alone, thus raising the possibility that the five pangolins seized in Guangdong in March 2019 were infected by the same virus strain, most probably during their captivity.",NA,588,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.07.077016v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.07.077016v1.full.pdf

Currently, there are over 1.5 million related deaths and 75 million people infected around the world (as of 22/12/2020). The identification of virulence factors which determine disease susceptibility and severity in different cell types remains an essential challenge. The serine protease TMPRSS2 has been shown to be important for S protein priming and viral entry, however, little is known about its regulation. SPINT2 is a member of the family of Kunitz type serine protease inhibitors and has been shown to inhibit TMPRSS2. Here, we explored the existence of a co-regulation between SPINT2/TMPRSS2 and found a tightly regulated protease/inhibitor expression balance across tissues. We found that SPINT2 negatively correlates with SARS-CoV-2 expression in Calu-3 and Caco-2 cell lines and was down-regulated in secretory cells from COVID-19 patients. We validated our findings using Calu-3 cell lines and observed a strong increase in viral load after SPINT2 knockdown. Additionally, we evaluated the expression of SPINT2 in datasets from comorbid diseases using bulk and scRNA-seq data. We observed its down-regulation in colon, kidney and liver tumors as well as in alpha pancreatic islets cells from diabetes Type 2 patients, which could have implications for the observed comorbidities in COVID-19 patients suffering from chronic diseases.",NA,157,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.28.424029v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.28.424029v1.full.pdf

Like in SARS-CoV, horseshoe bats currently represent the most likely candidate animal source for SARS-CoV-2. Yet, the specific mechanisms of cross-species transmission and adaptation to the human host remain unknown. Here we show that the unsupervised analysis of conservation patterns across the {beta}-CoV spike protein family, using sequence information alone, can provide rich information on the molecular basis of the specificity of {beta}-CoVs to different host cell receptors. More precisely, our results indicate that host cell receptor usage is encoded in the amino acid sequences of different CoV spike proteins in the form of a set of specificity determining positions (SDPs). Furthermore, by integrating structural data, in silico mutagenesis and coevolution analysis we could elucidate the role of SDPs in mediating ACE2 binding across the Sarbecovirus lineage, either by engaging the receptor through direct intermolecular interactions or by affecting the local environment of the receptor binding motif. Finally, by the analysis of coevolving mutations across a paired MSA we were able to identify key intermolecular contacts occurring at the spike-ACE2 interface. These results show that effective mining of the evolutionary records held in the sequence of the spike protein family can help tracing the molecular mechanisms behind the evolution and host-receptors adaptation of circulating and future novel {beta}-CoVs.

SignificanceUnraveling the molecular basis for host cell receptor usage among {beta}-CoVs is crucial to our understanding of cross-species transmission, adaptation and for molecular-guided epidemiological monitoring of potential outbreaks. In the present study, we survey the sequence conservation patterns of the {beta}-CoV spike protein family to identify the evolutionary constraints shaping the functional specificity of the protein across the {beta}-CoV lineage. We show that the unsupervised analysis of statistical patterns in a MSA of the spike protein family can help tracing the amino acid space encoding the specificity of {beta}-CoVs to their cognate host cell receptors. We argue that the results obtained in this work can provide a framework for monitoring the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 specificity to the hACE2 receptor, as the virus continues spreading in the human population and differential virulence starts to arise.",10.1016/j.csbj.2021.01.006,375,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.260745v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.260745v1.full.pdf

Using comparative genomics analysis, we traced the profiles of the whole-genome mutations and compared the frequency of each mutation in the studied population. The accumulation of mutations during the epidemic period with their geographic locations was also monitored. The results showed 782 variant sites, of which 512 (65.47%) had a non-synonymous effect. Frequencies of mutated alleles revealed the presence of 38 recurrent non-synonymous mutations, including ten hotspot mutations with a prevalence higher than 0.10 in this population and distributed in six SARS-CoV-2 genes. The distribution of these recurrent mutations on the world map revealed certain genotypes specific to the geographic location. We also found co-occurring mutations resulting in the presence of several haplotypes. Moreover, evolution over time has shown a mechanism of mutation co-accumulation which might affect the severity and spread of the SARS-CoV-2.

Because age-dependent differences of COVID-19 were identified in humans3, we compared the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in young and aged Syrian hamsters. We show that virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract was independent of the age of the animals. However, older hamsters exhibited more pronounced and consistent weight loss. In situ hybridization in the lungs identified viral RNA in bronchial epithelium, alveolar epithelial cells type I and II, and macrophages. Histopathology revealed clear age-dependent differences, with young hamsters launching earlier and stronger immune cell influx than aged hamsters. The latter developed conspicuous alveolar and perivascular edema, indicating vascular leakage. In contrast, we observed rapid lung recovery at day 14 after infection only in young hamsters.

There is no therapeutic treatment specific for COVID-19. It is highly desirable to identify potential antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 from existing drugs available for other diseases and, thus, repurpose them for treatment of COVID-19. In general, a drug repurposing effort for treatment of a new disease, such as COVID-19, usually starts from a virtual screening of existing drugs, followed by experimental validation, but the actual hit rate is generally rather low with traditional computational methods. Here we report a new virtual screening approach with accelerated free energy perturbation-based absolute binding free energy (FEP-ABFE) predictions and its use in identifying drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). The accurate FEP-ABFE predictions were based on the use of a new restraint energy distribution (RED) function designed to accelerate the FEP-ABFE calculations and make the practical FEP-ABFE-based virtual screening of the existing drug library possible for the first time. As a result, out of twenty-five drugs predicted, fifteen were confirmed as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The most potent one is dipyridamole (Ki=0.04 M) which has showed promising therapeutic effects in subsequently conducted clinical studies for treatment of patients with COVID-19. Additionally, hydroxychloroquine (Ki=0.36 M) and chloroquine (Ki=0.56 M) were also found to potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro for the first time. We anticipate that the FEP-ABFE prediction-based virtual screening approach will be useful in many other drug repurposing or discovery efforts.

Cell membrane bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and associated proteases, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and Cathepsin L (CTSL), were previously identified as mediators of SARS-CoV2 cellular entry. Here, we assess the cell type-specific RNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL through an integrated analysis of 107 single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-Seq studies, including 22 lung and airways datasets (16 unpublished), and 85 datasets from other diverse organs. Joint expression of ACE2 and the accessory proteases identifies specific subsets of respiratory epithelial cells as putative targets of viral infection in the nasal passages, airways, and alveoli. Cells that co-express ACE2 and proteases are also identified in cells from other organs, some of which have been associated with COVID-19 transmission or pathology, including gut enterocytes, corneal epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes, heart pericytes, olfactory sustentacular cells, and renal epithelial cells. Performing the first meta-analyses of scRNA-seq studies, we analyzed 1,176,683 cells from 282 nasal, airway, and lung parenchyma samples from 164 donors spanning fetal, childhood, adult, and elderly age groups, associate increased levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL in specific cell types with increasing age, male gender, and smoking, all of which are epidemiologically linked to COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes. Notably, there was a particularly low expression of ACE2 in the few young pediatric samples in the analysis. Further analysis reveals a gene expression program shared by ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells in nasal, lung and gut tissues, including genes that may mediate viral entry, subtend key immune functions, and mediate epithelial-macrophage cross-talk. Amongst these are IL6, its receptor and co-receptor, IL1R, TNF response pathways, and complement genes. Cell type specificity in the lung and airways and smoking effects were conserved in mice.

Several experimental structures of the ACE2:RBD complex have been made available, however they offer only a static description of the arrangements of the molecules in either the free or bound states. In order to gain a dynamic description of the binding process that is key to infection, we use molecular simulations with a coarse grained model of the RBD and ACE2. We find that binding occurs in an all-or-none way, without intermediates, and that even in the bound state, the RBD exhibits a considerably dynamic behaviour.

We show that the HLT model preserves its main cell populations, maintains the expression of proteins required for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and identifies alveolar type II (AT-II) cells as the most susceptible cell targets for SARS-CoV-2 in the human lung. Antiviral testing of 39 drug candidates revealed a highly reproducible system, and provided the identification of new compounds missed by conventional systems such as VeroE6. Using this model, we also show that interferons do not modulate ACE2 expression, and that stimulation of local inflammatory responses can be modulated by different compounds with antiviral activity.

Coronaviruses employ between twenty and thirty proteins to carry out their viral replication cycle including infection, immune evasion, and replication. Among these, nonstructural protein 16 (Nsp16), a 2-O-methyltransferase, plays an essential role in immune evasion. Nsp16 achieves this by mimicking its human homolog, CMTr1, which methylates mRNA to enhance translation efficiency and distinguish self from other. Unlike human CMTr1, Nsp16 requires a binding partner, Nsp10, to activate its enzymatic activity. The requirement of this binding partner presents two questions that we investigate in this manuscript. First, how does Nsp10 activate Nsp16? While experimentally-derived structures of the active Nsp16/Nsp10 complex exist, structures of inactive, monomeric Nsp16 have yet to be solved. Therefore, it is unclear how Nsp10 activates Nsp16. Using over one millisecond of molecular dynamics simulations of both Nsp16 and its complex with Nsp10, we investigate how the presence of Nsp10 shifts Nsp16s conformational ensemble in order to activate it. Second, guided by this activation mechanism and Markov state models (MSMs), we investigate if Nsp16 adopts inactive structures with cryptic pockets that, if targeted with a small molecule, could inhibit Nsp16 by stabilizing its inactive state. After identifying such a pocket in SARS-CoV-2 Nsp16, we show that this cryptic pocket also opens in SARS-CoV-1 and MERS, but not in human CMTr1. Therefore, it may be possible to develop pan-coronavirus antivirals that target this cryptic pocket.

Statement of SignificanceCoronaviruses are a major threat to human health. These viruses employ molecular machines, called proteins, to infect host cells and replicate. Characterizing the structure and dynamics of these proteins could provide a basis for designing small molecule antivirals. In this work, we use computer simulations to understand the moving parts of an essential SARS-CoV-2 protein, understand how a binding partner turns it on and off, and identify a novel pocket that antivirals could target to shut this protein off. The pocket is also present in other coronaviruses but not in the related human protein, so it could be a valuable target for pan-coronavirus antivirals.",10.1016/j.bpj.2021.03.024,313,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.420109v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.420109v1.full.pdf

First, ORF6 directly interacts with STAT1 in an IFN-independent manner to inhibit its nuclear translocation. Second, ORF6 directly binds to importin 1, which is a nuclear transport factor encoded by KPNA2, leading to a significant suppression of importin 1-mediated nuclear transport. Furthermore, we found that KPNA2 knockout enhances the viral replication, suggesting that importin 1 suppresses the viral propagation.

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has a pivotal role in cell-entry and host immune response, thus regarded as potential drug- and vaccine-target. As the virus utilizes the S1 domain of spike to initiate cell-attachment and S2 domain for membrane fusion, several attempts have been made to design viral-receptor and viral-fusion blockers. Here, by deploying interactive structure-based design and pharmacophore-based approaches, we designed short and stable peptide-biologics i.e. CoV-spike-neutralizing peptides (CSNPs) including CSNP1, CSNP2, CSNP3, CSNP4. We could demonstrate in cell culture experiments that CSNP2 binds to S1 at submicromolar concentration and abrogates the S1-hACE2 interaction. CSNP3, a modified and downsized form of CSNP2, could neither interfere with the S1-hACE2 interaction nor bind to S1. CSNP4 exhibited dose-dependent binding to both S1 and hACE2 and abolished the S1-hACE2 interaction in vitro. CSNP4 possibly enhance the mAb-based S1 neutralization by limiting the spontaneous movement of spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), whereas CSNP2 allowed RBD-mAb binding without any steric hindrance.

In addition to the acute pulmonary symptoms of COVID-19 (the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection), pulmonary and distal coagulopathies have caused morbidity and mortality in many patients. Currently, the molecular pathogenesis underlying COVID-19 associated coagulopathies are unknown. While there are many theories for the cause of this pathology, including hyper inflammation and excess tissue damage, the cellular and molecular underpinnings are not yet clear. By analyzing transcriptomic data sets from experimental and clinical research teams, we determined that changes in the gene expression of genes important in the extrinsic coagulation cascade in the lung epithelium may be important triggers for COVID-19 coagulopathy. This regulation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade is not seen with influenza A virus (IAV)-infected NHBEs suggesting that the lung epithelial derived coagulopathies are specific to SARS-Cov-2 infection. This study is the first to identify potential lung epithelial cell derived factors contributing to COVID-19 associated coagulopathy.

What did the researchers do and find?O_LIWe analyzed three publicly available RNA sequencing datasets to identify possible molecular etiologies of COVID-19 associated coagulopathies. These data sets include sequencing libraries from clinically isolated samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and healthy controls. We also analyzed a publicly available RNA sequencing dataset derived from in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and mock infected samples.
C_LIO_LIPathway analysis of both NHBE and BALF differential gene expression gene sets. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the activation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade and suppression of the plasminogen activation system in both NHBEs and cells isolated from the BALF. PBMCs did not differentially express genes regulating blood coagulation.
C_LIO_LIComparison with influenza A virus (IAV)-infected NHBEs revealed that the regulation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade is unique to SARS-CoV-2, and not seen with IAV infection.

We recently reported a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus strain (MA10) with the potential to infect wild-type laboratory mice, driving high levels of viral replication in respiratory tract tissues as well as severe clinical and respiratory symptoms, aspects of COVID-19 disease in humans that are important to capture in model systems. We evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of novel rhesus adenovirus serotype 52 (RhAd52) vaccines against MA10 challenge in mice. Baseline seroprevalence is lower for rhesus adenovirus vectors than for human or chimpanzee adenovirus vectors, making these vectors attractive candidates for vaccine development. We observed that RhAd52 vaccines elicited robust binding and neutralizing antibody titers, which inversely correlated with viral replication after challenge. These data support the development of RhAd52 vaccines and the use of the MA10 challenge virus to screen novel vaccine candidates and to study the immunologic mechanisms that underscore protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge in wild-type mice.

ImportanceWe have developed a series of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines using rhesus adenovirus serotype 52 (RhAd52) vectors, which exhibits a lower seroprevalence than human and chimpanzee vectors, supporting their development as novel vaccine vectors or as an alternative Ad vector for boosting. We sought to test these vaccines using a recently reported mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (MA10) virus to i) evaluate the protective efficacy of RhAd52 vaccines and ii) further characterize this mouse-adapted challenge model and probe immune correlates of protection.

However, the readout from the chemical modulation of a single protein is poorly correlated with phenotypic response of organism, leading to high failure rate in drug development. Chemical-induced gene expression profile provides an attractive solution to phenotype-based screening. However, the use of such data is currently limited by their sparseness, unreliability, and relatively low throughput. Several methods have been proposed to impute missing values for gene expression datasets. However, few existing methods can perform de novo chemical compound screening. In this study, we propose a mechanism-driven neural network-based method named DeepCE (Deep Chemical Expression) which utilizes graph convolutional neural network to learn chemical representation and multi-head attention mechanism to model chemical substructure-gene and gene-gene feature associations. In addition, we propose a novel data augmentation method which extracts useful information from unreliable experiments in L1000 dataset. The experimental results show that DeepCE achieves the superior performances not only in de novo chemical setting but also in traditional imputation setting compared to state-of-the-art baselines for the prediction of chemical-induced gene expression. We further verify the effectiveness of gene expression profiles generated from DeepCE by comparing them with gene expression profiles in L1000 dataset for downstream classification tasks including drug-target and disease predictions. To demonstrate the value of DeepCE, we apply it to patient-specific drug repurposing of COVID-19 for the first time, and generate novel lead compounds consistent with clinical evidences.

This secondary illness is characterized by formation and deposition of SAA amyloids in blood vessels, causing inflammation, thrombosis and sometimes organ failure, with symptoms resembling the multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) observed in some COVID-19 survivors. Hence, in order to understand better the danger of SAA amyloidosis in the context of COVID-19 we have used molecular dynamic simulations to study the effect of a SARS-COV-2 protein segment on SAA amyloid formation. We find that presence of the nine-residue segment SK9, located on the Envelope protein, increases the propensity for SAA fibril formation by three mechanisms: it reduces the stability of the lipid-transporting hexamer shifting the equilibrium toward monomers, it increases the frequency of aggregation-prone configurations in the resulting chains, and it raises the stability of SAA fibrils. Our results therefore suggest that SAA amyloidosis-related pathologies are a long-term risk of SARS-COV-2 infections.",NA,50,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.18.444723v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.18.444723v1.full.pdf

To better understand how SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) damages the heart, it is critical to elucidate the biology of CoV-2 encoded proteins, each of which may play multiple pathological roles. For example, CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (CoV-2-S) not only engages ACE2 to mediate virus infection, but also directly impairs endothelial function and can trigger innate immune responses in cultured murine macrophages. Here we tested the hypothesis that CoV-2-S damages the heart by activating cardiomyocyte (CM) innate immune responses. HCoV-NL63 is another human coronavirus with a Spike protein (NL63-S) that also engages ACE2 for virus entry but is known to only cause moderate respiratory symptoms. We found that CoV-2-S and not NL63-S interacted with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a crucial pattern recognition receptor that responsible for detecting pathogen and initiating innate immune responses. Our data show that the S1 subunit of CoV-2-S (CoV-2-S1) interacts with the extracellular leucine rich repeats-containing domain of TLR4 and activates NF-kB. To investigate the possible pathological role of CoV-2-S1 in the heart, we generated a construct that expresses membrane-localized CoV-2-S1 (S1-TM). AAV9-mediated, selective expression of the S1-TM in CMs caused heart dysfunction, induced hypertrophic remodeling, and elicited cardiac inflammation. Since CoV-2-S does not interact with murine ACE2, our study presents a novel ACE2-independent pathological role of CoV-2-S, and suggests that the circulating CoV-2-S1 is a TLR4-recognizable alarmin that may harm the CMs by triggering their innate immune responses.",NA,53,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.20.448993v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.20.448993v1.full.pdf

The primary viral target is the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Recent sequence analyses of the ACE2 gene predicts that many nonhuman primates are also likely to be highly susceptible to infection. However, the anticipated risk is not equal across the Order. Furthermore, some taxonomic groups show high ACE2 amino acid conservation, while others exhibit high variability at this locus. As an example of the latter, analyses of strepsirrhine primate ACE2 sequences to date indicate large variation among lemurs and lorises compared to other primate clades despite low sampling effort. Here, we report ACE2 gene and protein sequences for 71 individual strepsirrhines, spanning 51 species and 19 genera. Our study reinforces previous results and finds additional variability in other strepsirrhine species, and suggests several clades of lemurs have high potential susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Troublingly, some species, including the rare and Endangered aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), as well as those in the genera Avahi and Propithecus, may be at high risk.

However, there is scarce data relating COVID-19 risks and outcome with cigarette or e-cig use. In this study, we mined 3 independent RNA expression datasets from smokers and vapers to understand the potential relationship between vaping/smoking and the dysregulation of key genes and pathways related to COVID-19. We found that smoking, but not vaping, upregulates ACE2, the cellular receptor that SARS-CoV-2 requires for infection. Both smoking and use of nicotine and flavor-containing e-cig led to upregulations of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression of genes related to inflammasomes. Vaping flavor-less and nicotine-less e-cig, however, did not lead to significant cytokine dysregulation and inflammasome activation. Release of inflammasome products, such as IL-1B, and cytokine storms are hallmarks of COVID-19 infection, especially in severe cases. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that smoking or vaping, specifically use of flavored or nicotine-containing e-cigs, may critically exacerbate COVID-19-related inflammation or increase susceptibility to the disease.

Here, we isolated naive B cells across 8 human donors, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD).

Furthermore, naive antibodies can also neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses in the absence of any somatic hypermutation, suggesting that protective immunity to coronaviruses, more broadly, may be genetically encoded.

COVID-19 typically manifests as a respiratory illness but an increasing number of clinical reports describe gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. This is particularly true in children in whom GI symptoms are frequent and viral shedding outlasts viral clearance from the respiratory system. By contrast, fetuses seem to be rarely affected by COVID-19, although the virus has been detected in placentas of affected women. These observations raise the question of whether the virus can infect and replicate within the stomach once ingested. Moreover, it is not yet clear whether active replication of SARS-CoV-2 is possible in the stomach of children or in fetuses at different developmental stages. Here we show the novel derivation of fetal gastric organoids from 8-21 post-conception week (PCW) fetuses, and from pediatric biopsies, to be used as an in vitro model for SARS-CoV-2 gastric infection. Gastric organoids recapitulate human stomach with linear increase of gastric mucin 5AC along developmental stages, and expression of gastric markers pepsinogen, somatostatin, gastrin and chromogranin A. In order to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection with minimal perturbation and under steady-state conditions, we induced a reversed polarity in the gastric organoids (RP-GOs) in suspension. In this condition of exposed apical polarity, the virus can easily access viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The pediatric RP-GOs are fully susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, where viral nucleoprotein is expressed in cells undergoing programmed cell death, while the efficiency of infection is significantly lower in fetal organoids. The RP-GOs derived from pediatric patients show sustained robust viral replication of SARS-CoV-2, compared with organoids derived from fetal stomachs. Transcriptomic analysis shows a moderate innate antiviral response and the lack of differentially expressed genes belonging to the interferon family. Collectively, we established the first expandable human gastric organoid culture across fetal developmental stages, and we support the hypothesis that fetal tissue seems to be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in early stages of development.

To identify their genetic similarity, phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparing the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 sequences, selected from GISAID, to the complete genomes from Turkish isolates. In addition, we focused on the variation analysis to show the mutations on SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

MethodsIllumina MiSeq platform was used for sequencing the libraries. The raw reads were aligned to the known SARS-CoV-2 genome (GenBank: MN908947.3) using the Burrows-Wheeler aligner (v.0.7.1). The phylogenetic tree was constructer using Phylip v.3.6 with Neighbor-Joining and composite likelihood method. The variants were detected by using Genome Analysis Toolkit-HaplotypeCaller v.3.8.0 and were inspected on GenomeBrowse v2.1.2.

ResultsAll viral genome sequences of our isolates was located in lineage B under the different clusters such as B.1 (n=3), B.1.1 (n=28), and B.1.9 (n=16). According to the GISAID nomenclature, all our complete genomes were placed in G, GR and GH clades. Five hundred forty-nine total and 53 unique variants were detected. All 47 genomes exhibited different kinds of variants. The distinct variants consist of 274 missense, 225 synonymous, and 50 non-coding alleles.

ConclusionThe results indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 sequences of our isolates have great similarity with all Turkish and European sequences.

The spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 is a major antigen and its engagement with human ACE2 receptor plays an essential role in viral entry into host cells. Consequently, antibodies targeting the ACE2-interacting surface (ACE2IS) located in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein can neutralize the virus. However, the understanding of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 is still limited, and it is unclear how the virus protects this surface from recognition by antibodies. Here, we designed an RBD mutant that disrupts the ACE2IS and used it to characterize the prevalence of antibodies directed to the ACE2IS from convalescent sera of 94 COVID19-positive patients. We found that only a small fraction of RBD-binding antibodies targeted the ACE2IS. To assess the immunogenicity of different parts of the spike protein, we performed in vitro antibody selection for the spike and the RBD proteins using both unbiased and biased selection strategies. Intriguingly, unbiased selection yielded antibodies that predominantly targeted regions outside the ACE2IS, whereas ACE2IS-binding antibodies were readily identified from biased selection designed to enrich such antibodies. Furthermore, antibodies from an unbiased selection using the RBD preferentially bound to the surfaces that are inaccessible in the context of whole spike protein. These results suggest that the ACE2IS has evolved less immunogenic than the other regions of the spike protein, which has important implications in the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.",10.1016/j.jmb.2020.166748,358,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.03.365270v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.03.365270v1.full.pdf

Culture with IL-2/4/7 but not other cytokine-driven conditions resulted in >1000 fold expansion in SARS-CoV-2 T-cells with a retained phenotype, function and hierarchy of antigenic recognition when compared to baseline (pre-expansion) samples. Expanded CTLs were directed against structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including the receptor-binding domain of Spike. SARS-CoV-2 T-cells could not be efficiently expanded from the peripheral blood of non-exposed controls.

In addition, the effect of subsequent BALs was reviewed. Thorax CTs and BALs were obtained from four healthy animals and 11 experimentally SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. From all animals, CTs were obtained just before BAL, and 24 hours post-BAL. Additionally, from the healthy animals, CTs immediately after and four hours post-BAL were obtained. Thorax CTs were evaluated for alterations in lung density, measured in Hounsfield units, and a visual semi-quantitative scoring system. An increase in the lung density was observed on the immediately post-BAL CT but resolved within 24 hours in the healthy animals. In the infected animals, a significant difference in both the lung density and CT score was still found 24 hours after BAL. Furthermore, the differences between timepoints in CT score were increased for the second BAL.

This global pandemic has led to great efforts directed toward the study of this virus and its infection mechanism as well as development of effective means to control this devastating infectious disease5-8. Like many other viral surface proteins, the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is heavily glycosylated with 22 N- and 2 O-glycosites per monomer which are likely to influence S protein folding and evade host immune response9. More than one million S protein sequences with over 1,000 sites of mutation in its 1,273 amino acids have been reported to the GISAID database, including the highly transmissible variant strains found in the UK and South Africa10. This high frequency of transmission and mutation is a major challenge in the development of broadly protective vaccines to control the pandemic. We have studied the impact of glycosylation on receptor-ligand interaction through evaluation of ACE2 and S protein expressed in different cell lines. Of different S protein glycoforms, the one expressed from lung epithelial cells, the primary cells for infection, has more complex-type glycans and higher binding avidity to the receptor as compared with the S protein from HEK293T cells which have more high-mannose or hybrid-type glycoforms. We also found that most of the S protein glycosites are highly conserved and the glycosites at positions 801 and 1194 are essential for viral entry. In addition, the RBD of S1 and the HR regions of S2 contain most of highly conserved sequences, and removal of each glycosite on pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus for evaluation of the impact on structure and function provides insights into the design of broadly protective vaccines. In an effort to develop such universal vaccines, we found that mice immunized with monoglycosylated S protein (Smg) elicited better antibody responses capable of neutralizing not only the wild type but also the variants from the UK and South Africa than those with the fully-glycosylated S protein (Sfg), and strikingly, Smg vaccination provides better survival for hACE2 transgenic mice when challenged with lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, using single B cell technology, we isolated a monoclonal antibody from Smg immunized mice which was also able to neutralize the wild type and variants, suggesting that removal of unnecessary glycans from S protein to better expose the highly conserved sequences is an effective approach to developing broadly protective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and variants.",NA,149,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.25.445523v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.25.445523v1.full.pdf

This fine balance of tolerance and immunity, along with physiological and hormonal changes, contribute to increased susceptibility to particular infections in pregnancy, including more severe COVID-19 disease. Whether these changes also make pregnant women less responsive to vaccination or induce altered immune responses to vaccination remains incompletely understood. To holistically define potential changes in vaccine response during pregnancy and lactation, we deeply profiled the humoral vaccine response in a group of pregnant and lactating women and non-pregnant age-matched controls. Vaccine-specific titers were comparable, albeit slightly lower, between pregnant and lactating women, compared to non-pregnant controls. Among pregnant women, we found higher antibody titers and functions in those vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine. FcR-binding and antibody effector functions were induced with delayed kinetics in both pregnant and lactating women compared to non-pregnant women.

Isolation rate was 43 % with both strategies on RT-PCR positive samples, and was correlated with the initial RNA viral load in the samples, where we obtained a positivity threshold of 27 Ct. Co-culture delays were shorter with HCS strategy, where 80 % of the positive samples were recovered by the third day of co-culture, as compared to only 25 % with the classic strategy.

Informal accounts of anecdotal use of chlorine dioxide (ClO2), a well-known disinfectant and antiseptic, in COVID-19 patients has raised concern about potential toxicity, but also raises the question that ClO2 might elicit antiviral effects, a possibility that has never been examined in vivo in any animal model. Here, we challenged the hypothesis that ClO2 decreases the viral load and virus-induced mortality in a vertebrate model. For this, we determined viral load, virus-induced lesions and mortality in 10-day old chick embryos inoculated with 104 mean EID50/mL of attenuated Massachusetts and Connecticut avian coronavirus (IBV) strains.

ResultsThe ClO2 treatment had a marked impact on IBV infection. Namely, viral titres were 2.4-fold lower and mortality was reduced by half in infected embryos that were treated with ClO2. Infection led to developmental abnormalities regardless of treatment. Lesions typical of IBV infections were observed in all inoculated embryos, but severity tended to be significantly lower in ClO2-treated embryos. We found no gross or microscopic evidence of toxicity caused by ClO2 at the doses used herein.

ConclusionsOur study shows that ClO2 could be a safe and viable way of treating and mitigating the effects of avian coronavirus infections, and raises the possibility that similar effects could be observed in other organisms.

Infection of animals could be detrimental by causing clinical disease but also of concern if they become a viral reservoir allowing further mutations, plus having the potential to infect other animals or humans. The first reported animals to be infected both under experimental conditions and from anecdotal field evidence were cats described in China early in 2020. Given the concerns this finding raised and the close contacts between humans and cats, we aimed to determine whether a vaccine candidate could be developed that was suitable for use in multiple susceptible animal species and whether this vaccine could reduce infection of cats in addition to preventing spread to other cats.

Here we report that a Replicon Particle (RP) vaccine based on Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), known to be safe and efficacious for use in a variety of animals, expressing a stabilised Spike antigen, could induce neutralising antibody titers in guinea pigs and cats. After two intramuscular vaccinations, virus neutralising antibodies were detected in the respiratory tract of the guinea pigs and a cell mediated immune response was induced. The design of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen was shown to be critical in developing a strong neutralising antibody response. Vaccination of cats was able to induce a serum neutralising antibody response which lasted for the course of the experiment. Interestingly, in contrast to control animals, infectious virus could not be detected in oropharyngeal or nasal swabs of vaccinated cats after challenge. Moreover, the challenged control cats spread the virus to in-contact cats whereas the vaccinated cats did not transmit virus. The results show that the RP vaccine induces sterile immunity preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission.

Boolean gating techniques coupled with comparisons of relative abundances of cellular subsets is the current standard for cytometry data analysis. However, this approach is unable to capture more subtle topological features hidden in data, especially if those features are further masked by data transforms or significant batch effects or donor-to-donor variations in clinical data. We present that persistent homology, a mathematical structure that summarizes the topological features, can distinguish different sources of data, such as from groups of healthy donors or patients, effectively. Analysis of publicly available cytometry data describing non-naive CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients and healthy controls shows that systematic structural differences exist between single cell protein expressions in COVID-19 patients and healthy controls.

Our method identifies proteins of interest by a decision-tree based classifier and passes them to a kernel-density estimator (KDE) for sampling points from the density distribution. We then compute persistence diagrams from these sampled points. The resulting persistence diagrams identify regions in cytometry datasets of varying density and identify protruded structures such as  elbows. We compute Wasserstein distances between these persistence diagrams for random pairs of healthy controls and COVID-19 patients and find that systematic structural differences exist between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls in the expression data for T-bet, Eomes, and Ki-67. Further analysis shows that expression of T-bet and Eomes are significantly downregulated in COVID-19 patient non-naive CD8+ T cells compared to healthy controls. This counter-intuitive finding may indicate that canonical effector CD8+ T cells are less prevalent in COVID-19 patients than healthy controls. This method is applicable to any cytometry dataset for discovering novel insights through topological data analysis which may be difficult to ascertain otherwise with a standard gating strategy or in the presence of large batch effects.

Author summaryIdentifying differences between cytometry data seen as a point cloud can be complicated by random variations in data collection and data sources. We apply persistent homology used in topological data analysis to describe the shape and structure of the data representing immune cells in healthy donors and COVID-19 patients. By looking at how the shape and structure differ between healthy donors and COVID-19 patients, we are able to definitively conclude how these groups differ despite random variations in the data. Furthermore, these results are novel in their ability to capture shape and structure of cytometry data, something not described by other analyses.",NA,105,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.26.441473v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.26.441473v1.full.pdf

Here, we performed multi-omic single-cell immune profiling of 64 COVID-19 patients across the full range of disease severity, from outpatients with mild disease to fatal cases. Our transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic analyses reveal widespread dysfunction of peripheral innate immunity in severe and fatal COVID-19, with the most profound disturbances including a prominent neutrophil hyperactivation signature and monocytes with anti-inflammatory features. We further demonstrate that emergency myelopoiesis is a prominent feature of fatal COVID-19. Collectively, our results reveal disease severity-associated immune phenotypes in COVID-19 and identify pathogenesis-associated pathways that are potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Using sequences from the GISAID database, we catalogue over 100 insertions and deletions in the SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences. We hypothesize that these indels are artifacts of imperfect homologous recombination between SARS-CoV-2 replicates, and provide four independent pieces of evidence. (1) The SVs from the GISAID consensus sequences are clustered at specific regions of the genome. (2) These regions are also enriched for 5 and 3 breakpoints in the transcription regulatory site (TRS) independent transcriptome, presumably sites of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) template-switching. (3) Within raw reads, these structural variant hotspots have cases of both high intra-host heterogeneity and intra-host homogeneity, suggesting that these structural variants are both consequences of de novo recombination events within a host and artifacts of previous recombination. (4) Within the RNA secondary structure, the indels occur in ""arms"" of the predicted folded RNA, suggesting that secondary structure may be a mechanism for TRS-independent template-switching in SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses.

However, short and/or overlapping genes can be difficult to detect using conventional computational approaches, whereas high throughput experimental approaches - such as ribosome profiling - cannot distinguish translation of functional peptides from regulatory translation or translational noise. By studying regions showing enhanced conservation at synonymous sites in alignments of SARS-CoV and related viruses (subgenus Sarbecovirus), and correlating with the conserved presence of an open reading frame and plausible translation mechanism, we identified a putative new gene, ORF3a*, overlapping ORF3a in an alternative reading frame.

VOC 202012/01 could produce disease in hamsters characterized by body weight loss and respiratory tract tropism but mild lung pathology.

So far, we have collected 1159 plasma units from 282 COVID-19 convalescent donors. The presence of antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in convalescent donors was established at the first donation. Seropositive donors were asked to donate additional plasma units every six days. Until now, 15 donors have donated at least four times and, in some cases, up to nine times. This allowed us to perform a longitudinal analysis of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies in these repeat donors, with the first donation occurring 33-77 days after symptoms onset and donations up to 71-114 days after symptoms onset thereafter. In all donors, the level of antibodies remained relatively stable up to about 76 days after symptoms onset but then started to decrease more rapidly to reach, in some convalescent donors, a seronegative status within 100-110 days after symptoms onset. The decline in anti-RBD antibodies was not related to the number of donations but strongly correlated with the numbers of days after symptoms onset (r = 0.821). This suggests that de novo secretion of SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies by short-lived plasma cells stopped about 2-3 months after disease onset, an observation that has important implications for convalescent plasma collection and seroprevalence studies undertaken several months after the peak of infection.",NA,286,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.206847v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.206847v1.full.pdf

There are currently no approved drugs or vaccines for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Enhanced understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis is critical for the development of therapeutics. To reveal insight into viral replication, cell tropism, and host-viral interactions of SARS-CoV-2 we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of experimentally infected human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in air-liquid interface cultures over a time-course. This revealed novel polyadenylated viral transcripts and highlighted ciliated cells as a major target of infection, which we confirmed by electron microscopy. Over the course of infection, cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 expands to other epithelial cell types including basal and club cells. Infection induces cell-intrinsic expression of type I and type III IFNs and IL6 but not IL1. This results in expression of interferon-stimulated genes in both infected and bystander cells. We observe similar gene expression changes from a COVID-19 patient ex vivo. In addition, we developed a new computational method termed CONditional DENSity Embedding (CONDENSE) to characterize and compare temporal gene dynamics in response to infection, which revealed genes relating to endothelin, angiogenesis, interferon, and inflammation-causing signaling pathways.

The S protein of SARS-CoV-2, similar to type I fusion proteins of viruses such as HIV-1 envelope (Env) and influenza hemagglutinin, is heavily glycosylated. Viral Env glycans, though host derived, are distinctly processed and thereby recognized or accommodated during antibody responses. In recent years, highly potent and/or broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (bnAbs) that are generated in chronic HIV-1 infections have been defined. These bnAbs exhibit atypical features such as extensive somatic hypermutations, long complementary determining region (CDR) lengths, tyrosine sulfation and presence of insertions/deletions, enabling them to effectively neutralize diverse HIV-1 viruses despite extensive variations within the core epitopes they recognize. As some of the HIV-1 bnAbs have evolved to recognize the dense viral glycans and cross-reactive epitopes (CREs), we assessed if these bnAbs cross-react with SARS-CoV-2. Several HIV-1 bnAbs showed cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 while one HIV-1 CD4 binding site bnAb, N6, neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, neutralizing plasma antibodies of chronically HIV-1 infected children showed cross neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, our observations suggest that human monoclonal antibodies tolerating extensive epitope variability can be leveraged to neutralize pathogens with related antigenic profile.

ImportanceIn the current ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, neutralizing antibodies have been shown to be a critical feature of recovered patients. HIV-1 bnAbs recognize extensively diverse cross-reactive epitopes and tolerate diversity within their core epitope. Given the unique nature of HIV-1 bnAbs and their ability to recognize and/or accommodate viral glycans, we reasoned that the glycan shield of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can be targeted by HIV-1 specific bnAbs. Herein, we showed that HIV-1 specific antibodies cross-react and neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Understanding cross-reactive neutralization epitopes of antibodies generated in divergent viral infections will provide key evidence for engineering so called super-antibodies (antibodies that can potently neutralize diverse pathogens with similar antigenic features). Such cross-reactive antibodies can provide a blueprint upon which synthetic variants can be generated in the face of future pandemics.",NA,315,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.09.418806v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.09.418806v1.full.pdf

However, it is not known if ACIS KEPTIDE attenuates the entry of SARS-CoV2 virus in vivo in lung and kidney tissues, protects health, and prevent death once applied through intranasal route. In our current manuscript, we demonstrated that the intranasal administration of SARS-CoV2 (1*106) strongly induced the expression of ACE-2, promoted the entry of virions into the lung and kidney cells, caused acute histopathological toxicities, and mortality (28%). Interestingly, thirty-minutes of pre-treatment with 50 g/Kg Body weight ACIS normalized the expression of ACE-2 via receptor internalization, strongly mitigated that viral entry, and prevented mortality suggesting its prospect as a prophylactic therapy in the treatment of COVID-19. On the contrary, the peptide backbone of ACIS was unable to normalize the expression of ACE-2, failed to improve the health vital signs and histopathological abnormalities. In summary, our results suggest that ACIS is a potential vaccine-alternative, prophylactic agent that prevents entry of SARS-CoV2 in vivo, significantly improves respiratory health and also dramatically prevents acute mortality in K18-hACE2 humanized mice.

HighlightsO_LIACIS KEPTIDE stimulates the internalization of ACE-2 receptor (Fig. 2) and buffers the membrane localization of ACE-2 receptors (Fig. 2, 6 & 8). Intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV2 upregulates the expression of ACE-2 in lung epithelium (Fig.6) and kidney tubular cells (Fig.8). ACIS KEPTIDE normalizes the expression of ACE-2 in the kidney tubular cells of virus-treated K18-hACE2mice (Fig. 8).

Here, we show that anti-Spike IgG from serum of severely ill COVID-19 patients induces a hyper-inflammatory response by human macrophages, which subsequently breaks pulmonary endothelial barrier integrity and induces microvascular thrombosis. The excessive inflammatory capacity of this anti-Spike IgG is related to glycosylation changes in the IgG Fc tail. Moreover, the hyper-inflammatory response induced by anti-Spike IgG can be specifically counteracted in vitro by use of the active component of fostamatinib, an FDA- and EMA-approved therapeutic small molecule inhibitor of Syk.

Countless lives have been claimed due to the existing pandemic and the societal normalcy has been damaged permanently. As a result, it becomes crucial for academic researchers in the field of bioinformatics to combat the existing pandemic. The study involved collecting the virulent strain sequence of SARS-nCoV19 for the country USA against human host through publically available bioinformatics databases. Using in-silica analysis and reverse vaccinology, two leader proteins were identified to be potential vaccine candidates for development of a multi-epitope drug. The results of this study can provide further researchers better aspects and direction on developing vaccine and immune responses against COVID19. This work also aims at promoting the use of existing bioinformatics tools to faster streamline the pipeline of vaccine development.

The Situation of COVID19A new infection respiratory disease was first observed in the month of December 2019, in Wuhan, situated in the Hubei province, China. Studies have indicated that the reason of this disease was the emergence of a genetically-novel coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV. This coronavirus, now named as nCoV-19, is the reason behind the spread of this fatal respiratory disease, now named as COVID-19. The initial group of infections is supposedly linked with the Huanan seafood market, most likely due to animal contact. Eventually, human-to-human interaction occurred and resulted in the transmission of the virus to humans. [13].

Since then, nCoV-19 has been rapidly spreading within China and other parts of World. At the time of writing this article (mid-March 2020), COVID-19 has spread across 146 countries. A count of 164,837 cases have been confirmed of being diagnosed with COVID-19, and a total of 6470 deaths have occurred. The cumulative cases have been depicting a rising trend and the numbers are just increasing. WHO has declared COVID-19 to be a ""global health emergency"". [14].

Current Scenario and ObjectivesCurrently, research is being conducted on a massive level to understand the immunology and genetic characteristics of the disease. However, no cure or vaccine of nCoV-19 has been developed at the time of writing this article.

Though, nCoV-19 and SARS-CoV are almost genetically similar, the respiratory syndrome caused by both of them, COVID-19 and SARS respectively, are completely different. Studies have indicated that -

Our aim was to study colonic ACE2 expression in Crohns disease (CD) and non-inflammatory bowel disease (non-IBD) controls. We hypothesized that the colonic expression levels of ACE2 impacts CD course.

MethodsWe examined the expression of colon ACE2 using RNA-seq and quantitative (q) RT-PCR from 69 adult CD and 14 NIBD control patients. In a subset of this cohort we validated ACE2 protein expression and localization in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded matched colon and ileal tissues using immunohistochemistry. The impact of increased ACE2 expression in CD for the risk of surgery was evaluated by a multivariate regression analysis and a Kaplan-Meier estimator. To provide critical support for the generality of our findings, we analyzed previously published RNA-seq data from two large independent cohorts of CD patients.

ResultsColonic ACE2 expression was significantly higher in a subset of adult CD patients (ACE2-high CD). IHC in a sampling of ACE2-high CD patients confirmed high ACE2 protein expression in the colon and ileum compared to ACE2-low CD and NIBD patients. Notably, we found that ACE2-high CD patients are significantly more likely to undergo surgery within 5 years of diagnosis, with a Cox regression analysis finding that high ACE2 levels is an independent risk factor (OR 2.18; 95%CI, 1.05-4.55; p=0.037).

However, the mechanisms that underlie these age-dependent differences remain to be determined and could inform future therapeutics for adults.

ObjectiveTo contrast the infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in primary nasal epithelial cells from adults and children.

MethodsViral replication was quantified by plaque assay. The cellular transcriptome of infected and uninfected cells was assessed by RNA-seq. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein expression were quantified by Western Blot.

Measurements and Main ResultsWe report significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 replication in adult compared to pediatric nasal epithelial cells. This was restricted to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as the same phenomenon was not observed with influenza virus infection. The differentiational SARS-CoV-2 replication dynamics were associated with an elevated type I and III interferon response, and a more pronounced inflammatory response in pediatric cells. No significant difference between the two age groups was observed in the protein levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.

ConclusionsOur data suggest that the innate immune response of pediatric nasal epithelial cells, and not differential receptor expression, may contribute to the reported reduced SARS-COV-2 infection and symptoms reported amongst children.

At a Glance CommentaryO_ST_ABSScientific Knowledge on the SubjectC_ST_ABSThere is now a growing body of evidence that children are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to adults and if infected, children are more likely to develop an asymptomatic infection. The reasons for this remain unclear. In particular, the role of the pediatric nasal epithelium, the primary point of viral entry into the human host, in this differential susceptibility has yet to be investigated.

What This Study Adds to the FieldOur study indicates that pediatric nasal epithelial cells produce a more vigorous anti-viral and pro-inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 compared to adult cells. This is associated with reduced SARS-CoV-2, but not influenza virus, replication in pediatric epithelial cells. We also show that on a protein level SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression on nasal epithelial cells is not significantly different between children and adults. These data provide an important insight into pediatric infections with SARS-CoV-2.",NA,157,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.08.434300v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.08.434300v1.full.pdf

The stronger hACE2 affinity of SARS-CoV-2 has been connected with its higher infectivity. In this work, we study hACE2 complexes with the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of the human SARS-CoV-2 and human SARS-CoV viruses, using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Computational Protein Design (CPD) with a physics-based energy function. The MD simulations identify charge-modifying substitutions between the CoV-2 and CoV RBDs, which either increase or decrease the hACE2 affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The combined effect of these mutations is small, and the relative affinity is mainly determined by substitutions at residues in contact with hACE2. Many of these findings are in line and interpret recent experiments. Our CPD calculations redesign positions 455, 493, 494 and 501 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBM, which contact hACE2 in the complex and are important for ACE2 recognition. Sampling is enhanced by an adaptive importance sampling Monte Carlo method. Sequences with increased affinity replace CoV-2 glutamine by a negative residue at position 493, and serine by nonpolar, aromatic or a threonine at position 494. Substitutions at positions positions 455 and 501 have a smaller effect on affinity. Substitutions suggested by our design are seen in viral sequences encountered in other species, including bat and pangolin. Our results might be used to identify potential virus strains with higher human infectivity and assist in the design of peptide-based or peptidomimetic compounds with the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 binding at hACE2.

SARS-CoV-2 and the earlier, closely related SARS-CoV virus bind at the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor at the cell surface.

Here, we study by computational methods complexes of hACE2 with the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of viruses SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We identify residues affecting the affinities of the two domains for hACE2. We also propose mutations at key SARS-CoV-2 positions, which might enhance hACE2 affinity.

In vitro, HCQ effectively inhibits viral entry, but its use in the clinic has been hampered by conflicting results. A better understanding of HCQs mechanism of actions in vitro is needed to resolve these conflicts. Recently, anesthetics were shown to disrupt ordered monosialotetrahexosylganglioside1 (GM1) lipid rafts. These same lipid rafts recruit the SARS-CoV-2 surface receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to an endocytic entry point, away from phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2) domains. Here we employed super resolution imaging of cultured mammalian cells to show HCQ directly perturbs GM1 lipid rafts and inhibits the ability of ACE2 receptor to associate with the endocytic pathway. HCQ also disrupts PIP2 domains and their ability to cluster and sequester ACE2. Similarly, the antibiotic erythromycin inhibits viral entry and both HCQ and erythromycin decrease the antimicrobial host defense peptide amyloid beta in cultured cells. We conclude HCQ is an anesthetic-like compound that disrupts GM1 lipid rafts similar to anesthetics. The disruption likely decreases viral clustering at both endocytic and putative PIP2 entry points.

KEY POINTSQuestion: What is the molecular basis for antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine?

Findings: Hydroxychloroquine disrupt lipid rafts similar to general anesthetics.

Meaning: Since lipids cluster ACE2 and facilitate viral entry, hydroxychloroquine appears to inhibit viral entry by disrupting the lipid clustering of the SARS-CoV2 receptor.",NA,84,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.250217v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.250217v2.full.pdf

Moreover, liposome-encapsulated maduramycin and CP-80,219 provide full protection for mice from infection with JEV in vivo. Mechanistic studies suggest that aglycone polyether ionophores primarily inhibit the viral replication step without blocking endosome acidification to promote the fusion between viral and cellular membranes.

Herein, we employ Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the effect of temperature on four critical SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Our work demonstrates that the spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), Main protease (Mpro), and nonstructural protein 3 (macro X) possesses extreme thermos-stability when subjected to temperature variations rendering them attractive drug targets. Furthermore, our findings suggest that these four proteins are well adapted to habitable temperatures on earth and are largely insensitive to cold and warm climates. Furthermore, we report that the critical residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBD were less responsive to temperature variations as compared to the critical residues in SARS-CoV.

Investigations of these localized pathologies have been hindered by a lack of 3D in vitro human distal lung culture systems. Further, human distal lung stem cell identification has been impaired by quiescence, anatomic divergence from mouse and lack of lineage tracing and clonogenic culture. Here, we developed robust feeder-free, chemically-defined culture of distal human lung progenitors as organoids derived clonally from single adult human alveolar epithelial type II (AT2) or KRT5+ basal cells. AT2 organoids exhibited AT1 transdifferentiation potential, while basal cell organoids progressively developed lumens lined by differentiated club and ciliated cells. Organoids consisting solely of club cells were not observed. Upon single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), alveolar organoids were composed of proliferative AT2 cells; however, basal organoid KRT5+ cells contained a distinct ITGA6+ITGB4+ mitotic population whose proliferation segregated to a TNFRSF12Ahi subfraction. Clonogenic organoid growth was markedly enriched within the TNFRSF12Ahi subset of FACS-purified ITGA6+ITGB4+ basal cells from human lung or derivative organoids. In vivo, TNFRSF12A+ cells comprised ~10% of KRT5+ basal cells and resided in clusters within terminal bronchioles. To model COVID-19 distal lung disease, we everted the polarity of basal and alveolar organoids to rapidly relocate differentiated club and ciliated cells from the organoid lumen to the exterior surface, thus displaying the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 on the outwardly-facing apical aspect. Accordingly, basal and AT2 ""apical-out"" organoids were infected by SARS-CoV-2, identifying club cells as a novel target population. This long-term, feeder-free organoid culture of human distal lung alveolar and basal stem cells, coupled with single cell analysis, identifies unsuspected basal cell functional heterogeneity and exemplifies progenitor identification within a slowly proliferating human tissue.

In addition to this unique feature, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 (and its closely related coronaviruses) has a low CpG content. This has been postulated to be the signature of an evolutionary pressure exerted by the host antiviral protein ZAP.

Although the S protein of the closest related bat virus, RaTG13, shows high similarity to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein it does not efficiently interact with the human ACE2 receptor2. Here, we show that a single T403R mutation allows the RaTG13 S to utilize the human ACE2 receptor for infection of human cells and intestinal organoids. Conversely, mutation of R403T in the SARS-CoV-2 S significantly reduced ACE2-mediated virus infection. The S protein of SARS-CoV-1 that also uses human ACE2 also contains a positive residue (K) at this position, while the S proteins of CoVs utilizing other receptors vary at this location. Our results indicate that the presence of a positively charged amino acid at position 403 in the S protein is critical for efficient utilization of human ACE2.

As such, an aggressive initial innate immune response favors the host in contrast to a detrimental prolonged inflammation. The complement pathway bridges innate and adaptive immune system and contributes to the response by directly clearing pathogens or infected cells, as well as recruiting proinflammatory immune cells and regulating inflammation. However, the impact of modulating complement activation in viral infections is still unclear. In this work, we targeted the complement decay-accelerating factor (DAF/CD55), a surface protein that protects cells from non-specific complement attack, and analyzed its role in IAV infections. We found that DAF modulates IAV infection in vivo, via an interplay with the antigenic viral proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), in a strain specific manner. Our results reveal that, contrary to what could be expected, DAF potentiates complement activation, increasing the recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes and T cells. We also show that viral NA acts on the heavily sialylated DAF and propose that it exacerbates complement activation, leading to lung immunopathology. Remarkably, this mechanism has no impact on viral loads but rather on the host resilience to infection and may have direct implications in zoonotic influenza transmissions.

Author summaryExacerbated complement activation and immune deregulation are at the basis of several pathologies induced by respiratory viruses. Here, we report that complement decay-accelerating factor (DAF), which inhibits complement activation in healthy cells, increases disease severity upon Influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Remarkably, DAF interaction with IAV proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), resulted in excessive complement activation and recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells, without affecting viral loads. Furthermore, we observed that viral NA directly cleaves DAF and promotes complement activation, providing a possible link between IAV-DAF interaction and pathology. Therefore, our results unveil a novel pathway that could modulate disease severity, which may help to understand the increased pathogenicity of zoonotic and pandemic IAV infections.",NA,225,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.16.431406v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.16.431406v1.full.pdf

In line with other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to infect a broad range of hosts. SARS-CoV-2 genomes have now been isolated from cats, dogs, lions, tigers and minks. SARS-CoV-2 seems to transmit particularly well in mink farms with outbreaks reported in Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy, the USA and Denmark. Genomic data from SARS-CoV-2 isolated from infected minks provides a natural case study of a secondary host jump of the virus, in this case from humans to animals, and occasionally back again. We screened published SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from minks for the presence of recurrent mutations common in mink but infrequent in SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from human infections. We identify 23 recurrent mutations including three nonsynonymous mutations in the Receptor Binding Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that independently emerged at least four times but are only rarely observed in human lineages. The repeat emergence of mutations across phylogenetically distinct lineages of the virus isolated from minks points to ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to a new host. The rapid acquisition and spread of SARS-CoV-2 mutations in minks suggests that if a similar phenomenon of host adaptation had occurred upon its jump into humans, those human-specific mutations would likely have reached fixation already before the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes were generated.

Some viruses exploit these pathways to enter host cells as well as interfere with immune responses. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-1/2 Spike proteins (S) contain a potential inhibitory tyrosine- based immunoreceptor motif (ITIM) with the D614G variant occurring within this motif. Through an in silico screen of ITIM-containing human proteins, we find that the S-located ITIM is closely related to a previously reported ITIM in the cytoplasmic tail of the human Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor (LIFR), a pneumonia protective IL-6 family cytokine receptor. To infer potential functional interactions between SARS-CoV-2 infection and LIFR expression, we performed single-cell transcriptome analysis of public datasets of lung tissues from healthy individuals and COVID-19 patients. We show that transcripts of LIFR and its ligand LIF are highly expressed in SARS-CoV-2 susceptible lung cells from mild and severe COVID-19 patients but not in healthy individuals. In addition, the human endogenous retroviral envelope gene (ERVW-1) encoding a fusogenic protein of the same functional class as the S protein, is induced in SARS-CoV-2 susceptible cell subpopulations in COVID-19 patients with no detectable expression in healthy individuals. We also report that pulmonary epithelial cells express transcripts of several immunoreceptors including the ITIM-containing antibody receptor FCGR2B which is detectable in healthy and severe COVID-19 cases but not in mild cases.

Here, we identified an extended network of pairwise interactions between RBD and nanobodies H11-H4, H11-D4, and Ty1 by performing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Simulations of the nanobody-RBD-ACE2 complex revealed that H11-H4 more strongly binds to RBD without overlapping with ACE2 and triggers dissociation of ACE2 due to electrostatic repulsion. In comparison, Ty1 binding results in dissociation of ACE2 from RBD due to an overlap with the ACE2 binding site, whereas H11-D4 binding does not trigger ACE2 dissociation. Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V1 and 501.V2 variants resulted in a negligible effect on RBD-ACE2 binding. However, the 501.V2 variant weakened H11-H4 and H11-D4 binding while strengthening Ty1 binding to RBD.

In April 2021, the World Health Organization stated, however, the following: ""the current evidence on the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 patients is inconclusive"". It is speculated that the in vivo concentration of ivermectin is too low to exert a strong antiviral effect. Here, we performed a head-to head comparison of the antiviral activity of ivermectin and a structurally related, but metabolically more stable, moxidectin in multiple in vitro models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including physiologically relevant human respiratory epithelial cells. Both moxidectin and ivermectin exhibited antiviral activity in Vero E6 cells. Subsequent experiments revealed that the compounds predominantly act on a step after virus cell entry. Surprisingly, however, in human airway-derived cell models, moxidectin and ivermectin failed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, even at a concentration of 10 {micro}M. These disappointing results calls for a word of caution in the interpretation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of drugs solely based on Vero cells.

The extent to which viral shedding and transmission occurs on re-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 after prior natural exposure or vaccination is an emerging area of understanding. We used Sialodacryoadenitis Virus (SDAV) in rats to model the extent to which immune protection afforded by prior natural infection via high risk (inoculation; direct contact) or low risk (fomite) exposure, or by vaccination, influenced viral shedding and transmission on re-exposure. On initial infection, we confirmed that amount, duration and consistency of viral shedding were correlated with exposure risk. Animals were reinfected after 3.7-5.5 months using the same exposure paradigm. Amount and duration of viral shedding were correlated with re-exposure type and serologic status. 59% of seropositive animals shed virus. Previously exposed seropositive reinfected animals were able to transmit virus to 25% of naive recipient rats after 24-hour exposure by direct contact. Rats vaccinated intranasally with a related virus (Parkers Rat Coronavirus) were able to transmit SDAV to only 4.7% of naive animals after a 7-day direct contact exposure, despite comparable viral shedding. Observed cycle threshold values associated with transmission in both groups ranged from 29-36 cycles, however observed shedding was not a prerequisite for transmission.

While levels of genomic variability between SARS-CoV-2 isolates are limited, to our knowledge, it is not clear whether the observed patterns of variability in viral super-clades reflect ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, or merely genetic drift and founder effects. Here, we analyze more than 1100 complete, high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and provide evidence for the absence of distinct evolutionary patterns/signatures in the genomes of the currently known major clades of SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses suggest that the presence of distinct viral episomes at different geographic locations are consistent with founder effects, coupled with the rapid spread of this novel virus. We observe that while cross species adaptation of the virus is associated with hypervariability of specific protein coding regions (including the RDB domain of the spike protein), the more variable genomic regions between extant SARS-CoV-2 episomes correspond with the 3 and 5 UTRs, suggesting that at present viral protein coding genes should not be subjected to different adaptive evolutionary pressures in different viral strains.

The zebra mussels were exposed to treated wastewater through caging at the outlet of two plants located in France, as well as to raw wastewater at laboratory scale in controlled conditions. Within their digestive tissues, our results showed that SARS-CoV-2 genome was detected in zebra mussels, whether in raw and treated wastewaters. Moreover, the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in such bivalve molluscans appeared even with low concentrations in raw wastewaters. This is the first detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the tissues of a sentinel species exposed to raw and treated urban wastewaters. Despite the need for development for quantitative approaches, these results support the importance of such invertebrate organisms, especially zebra mussel, for the active surveillance of pathogenic microorganisms and their indicators in environmental waters.

We compared the Malaysia weekly epidemiological records of dengue incidences during the period of lockdown to the trend of previous years (2015 to 2019) and a simulation at the corresponding period that expected no movement restrictions. We found that the dengue incidence declined significantly with a greater magnitude at phase 1 of lockdown, with a negative gradient of 3.2-fold steeper than the trend observed in previous years and 6.5-fold steeper than the simulation, indicating that the control of population movement did reduce dengue transmission. However, starting from phase 2 of lockdown, the dengue incidences demonstrated an elevation and earlier rebound by at least 4 weeks and grew with an exponential pattern compared to the simulation and previous years. Together with our data on Aedes mosquitoes from a district of Penang, Malaysia, we revealed that Aedes albopictus is the predominant species for both indoor and outdoor environments. The abundance of the mosquito was increasing steadily during the period of lockdown, and demonstrated strong correlation with the locally reported dengue incidences; therefore, we proposed the possible diffusive effect of vector that led to a higher acceleration of incidence rate.

In this study, we characterised the sequence homology of SARS-CoV-2-derived T-cell epitopes reported in the literature across the entire diversity of the Coronaviridae family. Slightly over half (54.8%) of the tested epitopes did not have noticeable homology to any of the human endemic coronaviruses (HKU1, OC43, NL63 and 229E), suggesting prior exposure to these viruses cannot explain the full cross-reactive profiles observed in healthy unexposed individuals. Further, we find that the proportion of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 epitopes with noticeable sequence homology is extremely well predicted by the phylogenetic distance to SARS-CoV-2 (R2 = 96.6%). None of the coronaviruses sequenced to date showed a statistically significant excess of T-cell epitope homology relative to the proportion of expected random matches given the sequence similarity of their core genome to SARS-CoV-2.

Poly(A) Binding Protein Cytoplasmic 4 (PABPC4), Serine/Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitor Clade G Member 1 (SERPING1) and Vitamin K epOxide Reductase Complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), which are all proteins linked to coagulation, have been shown to interact with SARS proteins. We computationally examined the interaction of these with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and, in the case of VKORC1, we describe its binding to ORF7a in detail. We examined the occurrence of variants of each of these proteins across populations and interrogated their potential contribution to COVID-19 severity. Potential mechanisms by which some of these variants may contribute to disease are proposed. Some of these variants are prevalent in minority groups that are disproportionally affected by severe COVID-19. Therefore, we are proposing that further investigation around these variants may lead to better understanding of disease pathogenesis in minority groups and more informed therapeutic approaches.

Author summaryIncreased blood clotting, especially in the lungs, is a common complication of COVID-19. Infectious diseases cause inflammation which in turn can contribute to increased blood clotting. However, the extent of clot formation that is seen in the lungs of COVID-19 patients suggests that there may be a more direct link. We identified three human proteins that are involved indirectly in the blood clotting cascade and have been shown to interact with proteins of SARS virus, which is closely related to the novel coronavirus. We examined computationally the interaction of these human proteins with the viral proteins. We looked for genetic variants of these proteins and examined how these variants are distributed across populations. We investigated whether variants of these genes could impact severity of COVID-19.

Vaccine-elicited spike-specific T cells responded similarly to stimulation by spike epitopes from the ancestral, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variant strains, both in terms of cell numbers and phenotypes. In infection-naive individuals, the second dose boosted the quantity but not quality of the T cell response, while in convalescents the second dose helped neither. Spike-specific T cells from convalescent vaccinees differed strikingly from those of infection-naive vaccinees, with phenotypic features suggesting superior long-term persistence and ability to home to the respiratory tract including the nasopharynx. These results provide reassurance that vaccine-elicited T cells respond robustly to the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants, confirm that convalescents may not need a second vaccine dose, and suggest that vaccinated convalescents may have more persistent nasopharynx-homing SARS-CoV-2- specific T cells compared to their infection-naive counterparts.

SARS-CoV-2 infections initiate in the bronchi of the upper respiratory tract and are able to disseminate to the lower respiratory tract eventually causing acute severe respiratory syndrome with a high degree of mortality in the elderly. Here we use reconstituted primary bronchial epithelia from adult and children donors to follow the infection dynamic following infection with SARS-CoV-2. We show that in bronchial epithelia derived from adult donors, infections initiate in multi-ciliated cells. Then, infection rapidly spread within 24-48h throughout the whole epithelia. Within 3-4 days, large apical syncytia form between multi-ciliated cells and basal cells, which dissipate into the apical lumen. We show that these syncytia are a significant source of the released infectious dose. In stark contrast to these findings, bronchial epithelia reconstituted from children donors are intrinsically more resistant to virus infection and show active restriction of virus spread. This restriction is paired with accelerated release of IFN compared to adult donors. Taken together our findings reveal apical syncytia formation as an underappreciated source of infectious virus for either local dissemination or release into the environment. Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that children bronchial epithelia are more resistant to infection with SARS-CoV-2 providing experimental support for epidemiological observations that SARS-CoV-2 cases fatality is linked to age.

Significance StatementBronchial epithelia are the primary target for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our work uses reconstituted bronchial epithelia from adults and children. We show that infection of adult epithelia with SARS-CoV-2 is rapid and results in the synchronized release of large clusters of infected cells and syncytia into the apical lumen contributing to the released infectious virus dose. Infection of children derived bronchial epithelia revealed an intrinsic resistance to infection and virus spread, probably as a result of a faster onset of interferon secretion.

It is caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 with elusive origin. SARS-CoV-2 infects mammalian cells by binding to ACE2, a transmembrane protein. Therefore, the conservation of ACE2 and its expression pattern across mammalian species, which are yet to be comprehensively investigated, may provide valuable insights into tracing potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsWe analyzed gene conservation of ACE2 across mammals and collected more than 140 transcriptome datasets from human and common mammalian species, including presumed hosts of SARS-CoV-2 and other animals in close contact with humans. In order to enable comparisons across species and tissues, we used a unified pipeline to quantify and normalize ACE2 expression levels.

ResultsWe first found high conservation of ACE2 genes among common mammals at both DNA and peptide levels, suggesting that a broad range of mammalian species can potentially be the hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Next, we showed that high level of ACE2 expression in certain human tissues is consistent with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we observed that ACE2 expressed in a species-specific manner in the mammals examined. Notably, high expression in skin and eyes in cat and dog suggested that these animals may play roles in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to humans.

The method has its roots in studies of disorder in metal alloys, and is adapted to describe the type and occurrence of structural motifs within the arrangement of viral coat proteins, captured by the value of the order parameter as a measure of disorder. A conventional approach to viral vaccine design consists of replicating select proteins to create a VLP designed to trigger an immune response while remaining non-infectious. Understanding variations between viruses and vaccine strains therefore tends to focus on differences between proteins, which can be characterized through genetic analysis. While such an approach provides vital information about the functioning and interactions of the proteins, it does not yet yield an early-stage pathway towards predicting the efficacy of a vaccine, and so large-scale clinical trials are required to obtain critical information. With the urgency associated with pandemics, including Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) originating from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there is a need for earlier indications of whether a vaccine has the necessary characteristics. Application of the methodology to Dengue and influenza virus particles indicates that temperature and pH during incubation could potentially be exploited to fine-tune the order parameter of VLP-based vaccines to match the corresponding virus.

We analyse the SARS-CoV-2 virus, modelling its spike proteins binding to HS chains and two key entry receptors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2.

Our simulations strongly suggest that Remdesivir triphosphate (the active form of drug) is incorporated into the nascent RNA replacing ATP, leading to a duplex RNA which is structurally very similar to an unmodified one. We did not detect any reason to explain the inhibitory activity of Remdesivir at the active site. Displacement of the nascent Remdesivir-containing RNA duplex along the exit channel of the enzyme can occur without evident steric clashes which would justify delayed inhibition.

Here, we show that Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2 binds to 40S and 80S ribosomes, resulting in shutdown of capped mRNA translation both in vitro and in cells. Structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of in vitro reconstituted Nsp1-40S and of native human Nsp1-ribosome complexes revealed that the Nsp1 C-terminus binds to and obstructs the mRNA entry tunnel. Thereby, Nsp1 effectively blocks RIG-I-dependent innate immune responses that would otherwise facilitate clearance of the infection.

To fully understand how these mutations affect the antigenicity of Spike, we have isolated and characterized neutralizing antibodies targeting epitopes beyond the already identified RBD epitopes. Using recombinant Spike as a sorting bait, we isolated >100 Spike-reactive monoclonal antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. ~45% showed neutralizing activity of which ~20% were NTD-specific. None of the S2-specific antibodies showed neutralizing activity. Competition ELISA revealed that NTD-specific mAbs formed two distinct groups: the first group was highly potent against infectious virus, whereas the second was less potent and displayed glycan-dependant neutralization activity. Importantly, mutations present in B.1.1.7 Spike frequently conferred resistance to neutralization by the NTD-specific neutralizing antibodies.

Although the viral infection originates in the respiratory system, it is unclear how the virus can overcome the alveolar barrier, which is observed in severe COVID-19 disease courses.

To elucidate the viral effects on the barrier integrity and immune reactions, we used mono-cell culture systems and a complex human alveolus-on-a-chip model composed of epithelial, endothelial, and mononuclear cells.

Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected epithelial cells with high viral loads and inflammatory response, including the interferon expression. By contrast, the adjacent endothelial layer was no infected and did neither show productive virus replication or interferon release. With prolonged infection, both cell types are damaged, and the barrier function is deteriorated, allowing the viral particles to overbear.

In our study, we demonstrate that although SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the epithelium for efficient replication, the neighboring endothelial cells are affected, e.g., by the epithelial cytokine release, which results in the damage of the alveolar barrier function and viral dissemination.",NA,549,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.276725v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.276725v1.full.pdf

Characterization of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including immunoglobulin isotype usage, neutralizing activity and memory B cell generation, is necessary to provide critical insights on the formation of immune memory in Indian subjects. In this study, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody responses, neutralization of live virus, and RBD-specific memory B cell responses in pre-pandemic healthy versus convalescent COVID-19 individuals from India. We observed substantial heterogeneity in the formation of humoral and B cell memory post COVID-19 recovery. While a vast majority (38/42, 90.47%) of COVID-19 recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG responses, only half of them had appreciable neutralizing antibody titers. RBD-specific IgG titers correlated with these neutralizing antibody titers as well as with RBD-specific memory B cell frequencies. In contrast, IgG titers measured against SARS-CoV-2 whole virus preparation, which includes responses to additional viral proteins besides RBD, did not show robust correlation. Our results suggest that assessing RBD-specific IgG titers can serve as a surrogate assay to determine the neutralizing antibody response. These observations have timely implications for identifying potential plasma therapy donors based on RBD-specific IgG in resource-limited settings where routine performance of neutralization assays remains a challenge.

ImportanceOur study provides an understanding of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies, binding antibodies and memory B cells in COVID-19 convalescent subjects from India. Our study highlights that PCR-confirmed convalescent COVID-19 individuals develop SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG antibodies, which correlate strongly with their neutralizing antibody titers.

This study aimed to identify factors associated with COVID-19 fear among health workers in Nepal during the early phase of pandemic.

MethodsA web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in the month of April-May 2020 among 475 health workers directly involved in COVID-19 management. The Fear Scale of COVID 19 (FCV-19S) was used to measure the status of fear. Scatter plots were used to observe the relationship between fear and other psychological outcomes: anxiety, depression and insomnia. Multivariable logistic regression was done to identify factors associated with COVID fear.

ResultsCOVID-19 fear score was moderately correlated with anxiety and depression, and weakly correlated with insomnia (p<0.001).

In the fields of epidemiology and macroevolution these models can be used to estimate, respectively, the past number of infected individuals (prevalence) or the past number of species (paleodiversity) through time. Recent years have seen the development of ""total-evidence"" analyses, which combine molecular and morphological data from extant and past sampled individuals in a unified Bayesian inference framework. Even sampled individuals characterized only by their sampling time, i.e. lacking morphological and molecular data, which we call occurrences, provide invaluable information to reconstruct past population sizes.

Here, we present new methodological developments around the Fossilized Birth-Death Process enabling us to (i) efficiently incorporate occurrence data while remaining computationally tractable and scalable; (ii) consider piecewise-constant birth, death and sampling rates; and (iii) reconstruct past population sizes, with or without knowledge of the underlying tree. We implement our method in the RevBayes software environment, enabling its use along with a large set of models of molecular and morphological evolution, and validate the inference workflow using simulations under a wide range of conditions.

We finally illustrate our new implementation using two empirical datasets stemming from the fields of epidemiology and macroevolution. In epidemiology, we apply our model to the Covid-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess ship. We infer the total prevalence throughout the outbreak, by taking into account jointly the case count record (occurrences) along with viral sequences for a fraction of infected individuals. In macroevolution, we present an empirical case study of cetaceans.

Given the clinical importance of emergent viral variants with increased transmission, there is an urgent need to understand the early stages of viral replication and transcription. We used single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridisation (smFISH) to quantify positive sense RNA genomes with 95% detection efficiency, while simultaneously visualising negative sense genomes, sub-genomic RNAs and viral proteins. Our absolute quantification of viral RNAs and replication factories revealed that SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA is long-lived after entry, suggesting that it avoids degradation by cellular nucleases. Moreover, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 replication is highly variable between cells, with only a small cell population displaying high burden of viral RNA. Unexpectedly, the B.1.1.7 variant, first identified in the UK, exhibits significantly slower replication kinetics than the Victoria strain, suggesting a novel mechanism contributing to its higher transmissibility with important clinical implications.

However, the mode of virus transmission and tissue tropism is not well established yet. Recent findings of substantial liver damage in patients and ACE2+ cholangiocytes in healthy liver tissues prompted us to hypothesize that human liver ductal organoids could serve as a model to determine the susceptibility and mechanisms underlining the liver damage upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that long-term liver ductal organoid culture preserved the human specific ACE2+ population of cholangiocytes. Moreover, human liver ductal organoids were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and support robust replication. Notably, virus infection impaired the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes through dysregulation of genes involved in tight junction formation and bile acid transportation, which could explain the bile acid accumulation and consequent liver damage in patients. These results indicate that control of liver damage caused directly by viral infection should be valued in treating COVID-19 patients.

Activation of the Jak-Stat pathway by Interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-/{beta}) in lung epithelial cells is critical for innate immunity to respiratory viruses.

Furthermore, IFN /{beta} receptor activates multiple signal transduction pathways in parallel to the Jak-Stat pathway and induces several transcription factors at mRNA levels resulting in the secondary and tertiary rounds of transcription. Transcriptional factor profiling in the transcriptome and RNA analysis revealed that Early growth response-1 (Egr-1) was rapidly induced by IFN-/{beta} and Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands in multiple cell types. Studies in mutant cell lines lacking components of the ISGF-3 complex revealed that IFN-{beta} induction of Egr-1 was independent of Stat1, Stat2, or Irf9. Activation of the Mek/Erk-1/2 pathway was implicated in the rapid induction of Egr-1 by IFN-{beta} in serum-starved mouse lung epithelial cells.

In particular, SARS-CoV-2 is currently a major threat to public health worldwide. However, no commercial vaccines against the coronaviruses that can infect humans are available. The spike (S) homotrimers bind to their receptors through the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is believed to be a major target to block viral entry. In this study, we selected Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) as models. Their RBDs were observed to adopt two different conformational states (lying or standing). Then, structural and immunological analyses were used to explore differences in the immune response with RBDs among these coronaviruses. Our results showed that more RBD-specific antibodies were induced by the S trimer with the RBD in the ""standing"" state (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) than the S trimer with the RBD in the ""lying"" state (HCoV-229E), and the affinity between the RBD-specific antibodies and S trimer was also higher in the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we found that the ability of the HCoV-229E RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies was much lower and the intact and stable S1 subunit was essential for producing efficient neutralizing antibodies against HCoV-229E. Importantly, our results reveal different vaccine strategies for coronaviruses, and S-trimer is better than RBD as a target for vaccine development in Alpha-coronavirus. Our findings will provide important implications for future development of coronavirus vaccines.

ImportanceOutbreak of coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2, poses a serious threat to global public health. Development of vaccines to prevent the coronaviruses that can infect humans has always been a top priority. Coronavirus spike (S) protein is considered as a major target for vaccine development. Currently, structural studies have shown that Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) RBDs are in lying and standing state, respectively. Here, we tested the ability of S-trimer and RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies among these coronaviruses. Our results showed that Beta-CoVs RBDs are in a standing state, and their S proteins can induce more neutralizing antibodies targeting RBD. However, HCoV-229E RBD is in a lying state, and its S protein induces a low level of neutralizing antibody targeting RBD. Our results indicate that Alpha-coronavirus is more conducive to escape host immune recognition, and also provide novel ideas for the development of vaccines targeting S protein.",10.1128/JVI.02284-20,438,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.09.141580v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.09.141580v1.full.pdf

Herein we describe an ACE2-lentivirus system and illustrate its utility for in vitro and in vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection models. Transduction of non-permissive cell lines with hACE2 imparted replication competence, and transduction with mACE2 containing N30D, N31K, F83Y and H353K substitutions, to match hACE2, rescued SARS-CoV-2 replication. Intranasal hACE2-lentivirus transduction of C57BL/6J mice permitted significant virus replication in lungs. RNA-Seq analyses illustrated that the model involves an acute inflammatory disease followed by resolution and tissue repair, with a transcriptomic profile similar to that seen in COVID-19 patients. Intranasal hACE2-lentivirus transduction of IFNAR-/- and IL-28RA-/- mice lungs was used to illustrate that loss of type I or III interferon responses have no significant effect on virus replication. However, their importance in driving inflammatory responses was illustrated by RNA-Seq analyses. We also demonstrate the utility of the hACE2-lentivirus transduction system for vaccine evaluation in C57BL/6J mice. The ACE2-lentivirus system thus has broad application in SARS-CoV-2 research, providing a tool for both mutagenesis studies and mouse model development.

AUTHOR SUMMARYSARS-CoV-2 uses the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor to infect cells, but cannot infect mice because the virus cannot bind mouse ACE2 (mACE2). We use an ACE2-lentivirus system in vitro to identify four key amino acids in mACE2 that explain why SARS-CoV-2 cannot infect mice. hACE2-lentivirus was used to express hACE2 in mouse lungs in vivo, with the inflammatory responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection similar to those seen in human COVID-19. Genetically modified mice were used to show that type I and III interferon signaling is required for the inflammatory responses. We also show that the hACE2-lentivirus mouse model can be used to test vaccines. Overall this paper demonstrates that our hACE2-lentivirus system has multiple applications in SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 research.",NA,48,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.09.430547v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.09.430547v3.full.pdf

Inadequate and defective IFN type I responses against SARS-CoV-2, caused by autoantibodies in a proportion of patients, lead to severe courses. In addition, hyperactive responses of the humoral immune system have been described so far.

RATIONALEIn the current study we investigated a possible role of neutralizing autoantibodies against anti-inflammatory mediators. Plasma from patients with severe and critical COVID-19 was screened by ELISA for antibodies against PGRN, IL-10, IL-18BP, IL-22BP and IL-1-RA. Autoantibodies were characterized and the antigens were analyzed for immunogenic alterations.

RESULTSPGRN-autoantibodies were detected with high titers in 11 of 30 (36.7%), and IL-1-RA-autoantibodies in 14 of 30 (46.7%) patients of a discovery cohort with severe to critical COVID-19. In a validation cohort of 41 patients with critical COVID-19 high-titered PGRN-Abs were detected in 12 (29.3%) and IL-1-RA-Abs in 19 of 41 patients (46.2%). PGRN-Abs and IL-1-RA-Abs belonged to IgM and several IgG subclasses. In separate cohorts with non-critical COVID-19, PGRN-Abs and IL-1-RA-Abs were detected significantly less frequently and at low titers. Neither PGRN-nor IL-1-RA-Abs were found in 40 healthy controls vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. PGRN-Abs were not cross-reactive against SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins or against IL-1-RA. Plasma levels of both free PGRN and IL-1-RA were significantly decreased in autoantibody-positive patients compared to Ab-negative and non-COVID controls. Functionally, PGRN-Abs from patients reduced PGRN-dependent inhibition of TNF- signaling in vitro. The pSer81 hyperphosphorylated PGRN isoform was exclusively detected in patients with high-titer PGRN-Abs; likewise, a yet unidentified hyperphosphorylated IL-1-RA isoform was only found in patients with high-titer IL-1-RA-Abs. No autoantibodies against IL-10, IL-18BP or IL-22BP were found.

CONCLUSIONTo conclude, neutralizing autoantibodies to IL-1-RA and PGRN occur in a significant proportion of patients with critical COVID-19, with a concomitant decrease in circulating PGRN and IL-1-RA, which is indicative of a misdirected, proinflammatory autoimmune response. The break of self-tolerance is likely caused by atypical isoforms of both antigens due to hyperphosphorylation. It remains to be determined whether these secondary modifications are induced by the SARS-CoV-2-infection itself, or are preexisting and predispose for a critical course.",NA,69,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.23.441188v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.23.441188v1.full.pdf

In human studies, CT prevented colds in healthy subjects and enhanced antibody production after influenza vaccination in elderly individuals with a poor nutritional status. The mechanism of action of CT is thought to be glutathione (GSH)-mediated regulation of intracellular redox, which might affect innate immune systems such as macrophages to exert physiological effects. The effect of CT on influenza is independent of viral type, and this treatment has a broad range of antiviral activities. To explore the mechanisms of CT in viral infection, we performed transcriptome profiling of spleen tissues isolated from influenza A virus (IAV)-infected mice. We identified unique gene signatures in response to CT in the IAV-infected mice. Genes upregulated by CT included redox-regulated genes such as GCLC/GCLM (subunits of glutamate cysteine ligase, a rate-limiting enzyme of GSH biosynthesis), TXN1, TXN2, TXNRD2, and SOD1, suggesting that the intracellular redox environment is substantially altered by CT. However, genes downregulated in response to CT included chemokine/chemokine receptor genes (CCL5, CCL19, CXCL9, CXCL12, CXCR3, CXCR4, and ACKR3), some of which are related to cytokine storm. A comparison with public COVID-19-related gene set data showed that the upregulated gene signature was highly similar to the downregulated gene sets of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and the upregulated gene set of attenuated SARS-CoV-infected cells. In conclusion, the unique gene signatures observed in response to orally administered CT in IAV-infected mouse spleen tissues suggested that CT may attenuate viral infection, replication and associated symptoms such as cytokine storm.",NA,83,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.149427v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.149427v2.full.pdf

This disease is characterized by important damages at multi-organ level, partially due to the abundant expression of ACE2 in practically all human tissues.

We consider here diffusive processes through the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2 as such alternative route. We found a subdiffusive regime that allows the propagation of virus perturbations through the PPI network at a significant rate.

Recently, several studies have investigated the effect of psychoactive drugs on SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture models as well as in clinical practice. Our aim was to expand these studies and test some of these compounds against newly emerged variants.

Experimental ApproachSeveral antidepressant drugs and antipsychotic drugs with different primary mechanisms of action were tested in ACE2/TMPRSS2-expressing human embryonic kidney cells against the infection by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-dependent pseudoviruses. Some of these compounds were also tested in human lung epithelial cell line, Calu-1, against the first wave (B.1) lineage of SARS-CoV-2 and the variants of concern, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351.

Key ResultsSeveral clinically used antidepressants, including fluoxetine, citalopram, reboxetine, imipramine, as well as antipsychotic compounds chlorpromazine, flupenthixol, and pimozide inhibited the infection by pseudotyped viruses with minimal effects on cell viability. The antiviral action of several of these drugs was verified in Calu-1 cells against the (B.1) lineage of SARS-CoV-2. By contrast, the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, and novel antidepressants ketamine and its derivatives as well as MAO and phosphodiesterase inhibitors phenelzine and rolipram, respectively, showed no activity in the pseudovirus model. Furthermore, fluoxetine remained effective against pseudo viruses with N501Y, K417N, and E484K spike mutations, and the VoC-1 (B.1.1.7) and VoC-2 (B.1.351) variants of SARS-CoV-2.

Seven coronaviruses (CoVs) have been shown to infect humans, including the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). The host response to CoV infection is complex and regulated, in part, by intracellular antiviral signaling pathways triggered in the first cells that are infected. Emerging evidence suggests that CoVs hijack these antiviral responses to reshape the production of interferons and proinflammatory cytokines. Processing bodies (PBs) are membraneless ribonucleoprotein granules that mediate decay or translational suppression of cellular mRNAs; this is particularly relevant for proinflammatory cytokine mRNA which normally reside in PBs and are repressed. Emerging evidence also suggests that PBs or their components play important direct-acting antiviral roles, providing a compelling reason for their frequent disassembly by many viruses. No information is known about how human CoVs impact PBs. Here, we provide data to show that infection with the human CoV, OC43, causes PB disassembly. Moreover, we show that several SARS-CoV-2 gene products also mediate PB loss and virus-induced PB loss correlates with elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokine mRNAs that would normally be repressed in PBs. Finally, we demonstrate that stimulating PB formation prior to OC43 infection restricts viral replication. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs disassemble PBs during infection to support viral replication and evade innate immune responses. As an unintended side effect, the disassembly of PBs enhances translation of proinflammatory cytokine mRNAs which normally reside in PBs, thereby reshaping the subsequent immune response.",NA,249,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.08.372995v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.08.372995v1.full.pdf

In this study, we dissect the anti-coronavirus activity of Cissampelos pareira L (Cipa). using an integrative approach.

MethodsWe analysed the signature similarities between predicted antiviral agents and Cipa using the connectivity map (https://clue.io/). Next, we tested the anti-SARS-COV-2 activity of Cipa in vitro. A three-way comparative analysis of Cipa transcriptome, COVID-19 BALF transcriptome and CMAP signatures of small compounds was also performed.

ResultsSeveral predicted antivirals showed a high positive connectivity score with Cipa such as apcidin, emetine, homoharringtonine etc. We also observed 98% inhibition of SARS-COV-2 replication in infected Vero cell cultures with the whole extract. Some of its prominent pure constituents e.g pareirarine, cissamine, magnoflorine exhibited 40-80% inhibition. Comparison of genes between BALF and Cipa showed an enrichment of biological processes like transcription regulation and response to lipids, to be downregulated in Cipa while being upregulated in COVID-19.

We observed that N- and O-glycans had only minor contribution to Spike-ACE2 binding. However, these carbohydrates played a major role in regulating viral entry. Blocking N-glycan biosynthesis at the oligomannose stage using both genetic approaches and the small molecule kifunensine dramatically reduced viral entry into ACE2 expressing HEK293T cells. Blocking O-glycan elaboration also partially blocked viral entry. Mechanistic studies suggest multiple roles for glycans during viral entry.

Although environmental, demographicand co-morbidity factors have an impact on the severity of the disease, the contribution of mutations in each of the viral genes towards the degree of severity needs to be elucidated for designing better therapeutic approach against COVID-19. Here, we studied the effect of two substitutions D155Y and S171L, of ORF3a protein, found in COVID-19 patients. Using computational simulations we discovered that the substitutions at 155th and 171st positions changed the amino acids involved in salt bridge formation, hydrogen-bond occupancy, interactome clusters, and the stability of the protein. Protein-protein docking using HADDOCK analysis revealed that out of the two observed substitutions, only the substitution of D155Y, weakened the binding affinity of ORF3a with caveolin-1. The increased fluctuation in the simulated ORF3a-caveolin-1 complex suggested a change in the virulence property of SARS-CoV-2.

ImportanceThe binding interaction of viral ORF3a protein to host caveolin-1 is essential for entry and endomembrane trafficking of SARS-CoV-2. The D155Y substitution in SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a is located near its caveolin-binding Domain IV and thus the substitution can interfere with the binding affinity of ORF3a to host caveolin-1. Our in silico study report decreased molecular stability of D155Y mutant of ORF3a and increased fluctuation of the simulated D155Y ORF3a-caveolin-1 complex.

This offers opportunities to study pathways of molecular change in the expanding viral population that can help identify molecular culprits of virulence and virus spread. Here we investigate the genomic accumulation of mutations at various time points of the early pandemic to identify changes in mutationally highly active genomic regions that are occurring worldwide. We used the Wuhan NC_045512.2 sequence as a reference and sampled 15,342 indexed sequences from GISAID, translating them into proteins and grouping them by month of deposition. The per-position amino acid frequencies and Shannon entropies of the coding sequences were calculated for each month, and a map of intrinsic disorder regions and binding sites was generated. The analysis revealed dominant variants, most of which were located in loop regions and on the surface of the proteins. Mutation entropy decreased between March and April of 2020 after steady increases at several sites, including the D614G mutation site of the spike (S) protein that was previously found associated with higher case fatality rates and at sites of the NSP 12 polymerase and the NSP13 helicase proteins. Notable expanding mutations include R203K and G204R of the nucleocapsid (N) protein inter-domain linker region and G251V of the viroporin encoded by ORF3a between March and April. The regions spanning these mutations exhibited significant intrinsic disorder, which was enhanced and decreased by the N-protein and viroporin 3a protein mutations, respectively.

The unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on global health has resulted in multiple studies generating extensive gene expression datasets in a relatively short period of time. In order to better understand the immune dysregulation induced by SARS-CoV-2, we carried out a meta-analysis of these transcriptomics data available in the published literature. Datasets included both those available from SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines in vitro and those from patient samples. We focused our analysis on the identification of viral perturbed host functions as captured by co-expressed gene module analysis. Transcriptomics data from lung biopsies and nasopharyngeal samples, as opposed to those available from other clinical samples and infected cell lines, provided key signatures on the role of the hosts immune response on COVID-19 pathogenesis. For example, severity of infection and patients age are linked to the absence of stimulation of the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, a known critical immediate line of defense against RNA viral infections that triggers type-I interferon responses. In addition, co-expression analysis of age-stratified transcriptional data provided evidence that signatures of key immune response pathways are perturbed in older COVID-19 patients. In particular, dysregulation of antigen-presenting components, down-regulation of cell cycle mechanisms and signatures of hyper-enriched monocytes were strongly correlated with the age of older individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a cytotoxic response of CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, characterized by the simultaneous production of granzyme A and B, as well as perforin within different effector CD8+ T cell subsets. PD-1 expressing CD8+ T cells also produced cytotoxic molecules during acute infection indicating that they were not functionally exhausted. However, in COVID-19 patients over the age of 80 years the cytotoxic T cell potential was diminished, especially in effector memory and terminally differentiated effector CD8+ cells, showing that elderly patients have impaired cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

Our data provides valuable information about T cell responses in COVID-19 patients that may also have important implications for vaccine development.

ImportanceCytotoxic T cells are responsible for the elimination of infected cells and are key players for the control of viruses. CD8+ T cells with an effector phenotype express cytotoxic molecules and are able to perform target cell killing. COVID-19 patients with a mild disease course were analyzed for the differentiation status and cytotoxic profile of CD8+ T cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a vigorous cytotoxic CD8+ T cell response. However, this cytotoxic profile of T cells was not detected in COVID-19 patients over the age of 80 years.

As a public health measure, efficient screening methods are needed to determine the functional effects of new sequence variants. Here we show that structural modeling of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding to the human ACE2 receptor, the first step in host-cell entry, predicts many novel variant combinations with enhanced binding affinities. By focusing on natural variants at the Spike-hACE2 interface and assessing over 700 mutant complexes, our analysis reveals that high-affinity Spike mutations (including N440K, S443A, G476S, E484R, G502P) tend to cluster near known human ACE2 recognition sites (K31 and K353). These Spike regions are conformationally flexible, allowing certain mutations to optimize interface interaction energies. Although most human ACE2 variants tend to weaken binding affinity, they can interact with Spike mutations to generate high-affinity double mutant complexes, suggesting variation in individual susceptibility to infection. Applying structural analysis to highly transmissible variants, we find that circulating point mutations S447N, E484K and N501Y form high-affinity complexes (~40% more than wild-type). By combining predicted affinities and available antibody escape data, we show that fast-spreading viral variants exploit combinatorial mutations possessing both enhanced affinity and antibody resistance, including S447N/E484K, E484K/N501Y and K417T/E484K/N501Y.

Amino acid changes in the RBD have been implicated with increased infectivity and potential for immune evasion. Reliably predicting the effect of amino acid changes in the ability of the RBD to interact more strongly with the hACE2 receptor can help assess the public health implications and the potential for spillover and adaptation into other animals. Here, we introduce a two-step framework that first relies on 48 independent 4-ns molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of RBD-hACE2 variants to collect binding energy terms decomposed into Coulombic, covalent, van der Waals, lipophilic, generalized Born electrostatic solvation, hydrogen-bonding, {pi}-{pi} packing and self-contact correction terms. The second step implements a neural network to classify and quantitatively predict binding affinity using the decomposed energy terms as descriptors. The computational base achieves an accuracy of 82.2% in terms of correctly classifying single amino-acid substitution variants of the RBD as worsening or improving binding affinity for hACE2 and a correlation coefficient r of 0.69 between predicted and experimentally calculated binding affinities. Both metrics are calculated using a 5-fold cross validation test. Our method thus sets up a framework for effectively screening binding affinity change with unknown single and multiple amino-acid changes.

ResultsMolecular modeling and simulations reveal that N501Y, shared by both variants, increases ACE2 binding affinity, and may impact the collective dynamics of the ACE2-RBD complex, occupying a central hinge site that modulates the overall dynamics of the complex. In contrast, the substitutions K417N and E484K in the South African variant 501.V2 would reduce the ACE2-binding affinity by abolishing two interfacial salt bridges that facilitate RBD binding to ACE2, K417(S)-D30(ACE2) and E484 (S)-K31(ACE2). These two mutations may thus be more than compensating the attractive effect induced by N501Y, overall resulting in an ACE2-binding affinity comparable to that of the wildtype RBD. Further analysis of the impact of these mutations on the interactions with mAbs targeting the spike indicate that the substitutions K417N and E484K may also abolish the salt bridges between the spike and selected mAbs, such as REGN10933, BD23, H11_H4, and C105, thus reducing the binding affinity and effectiveness of these mAbs.

A recent, large-scale, retrospective clinical study showed that famotidine, when administered at a high dose to hospitalized COVID-19 patients, reduced the rates of intubation and mortality. A separate, patient-reported study associated famotidine use with improvements in mild to moderate symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath. While a prospective, multi-center clinical study is ongoing, two parallel in silico studies have proposed one of the two SARS-CoV-2 proteases, 3CLpro or PLpro, as potential molecular targets of famotidine activity; however, this remains to be experimentally validated. In this report, we systematically analyzed the effect of famotidine on viral proteases and virus replication. Leveraging a series of biophysical and enzymatic assays, we show that famotidine neither binds with nor inhibits the functions of 3CLpro and PLpro. Similarly, no direct antiviral activity of famotidine was observed at concentrations of up to 200 M, when tested against SARS-CoV-2 in two different cell lines, including a human cell line originating from lungs, a primary target of COVID-19. These results rule out famotidine as a direct-acting inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication and warrant further investigation of its molecular mechanism of action in the context of COVID-19.",10.1038/s41598-021-84782-w,409,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.203059v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.203059v1.full.pdf

The synthetic analogue poly I:C is frequently used to mimic anti-viral innate immune responses in models of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders including schizophrenia, autism, Parkinsons disease and Alzheimers disease. Many studies perform limited analysis of innate immunity despite these responses potentially differing as a function of dsRNA molecular weight and age. Therefore fundamental questions relevant to impacts of systemic viral infection on brain function and integrity remain. Here, we studied innate immune-inducing properties of poly I:C preparations of different lengths and responses in adult and aged mice. High molecular weight (HMW) poly I:C (1-6kb, 12 mg/kg) produced more robust sickness behavior and more robust IL-6, IFN-I and TNF responses than poly I:C of <500 bases (low MW) preparations. This was partly overcome with higher doses of LMW (up to 80 mg/kg), but neither circulating IFN{beta} nor brain transcription of Irf7 were significantly induced by LMW poly I:C, despite brain Ifnb transcription, suggesting that brain IFN-dependent gene expression is predominantly triggered by circulating IFN{beta} binding of IFNAR1. In aged animals, poly I:C induced exaggerated IL-6, IL-1{beta} and IFN-I in the plasma and similar exaggerated brain cytokine responses. This was associated with acute working memory deficits selectively in aged mice. Thus, we demonstrate dsRNA length-, IFNAR1- and age-dependent effects on anti-viral inflammation and cognitive function.

This includes understanding the dynamicity of the various polymerase subdomains, analyzing the hydrogen bond networks at the active site and at the template entry in the presence of water, studying the binding modes of the nucleotides at the active site, highlighting positions for acceptable nucleotides substitutions that can be tolerated at different positions within the nascent RNA strand, identifying possible allosteric sites within the polymerase structure and studying their correlated dynamics relative to the catalytic site. Here, we combined various cutting-edge modelling tools with the recently resolved SARS-CoV-2 cryo-EM polymerase structures to fill this gap in knowledge. Our findings provide a detailed analysis of the hydrogen bond networks at various parts of the polymerase structure and suggest possible nucleotides substitutions that can be tolerated by the polymerase complex.

Most SARS CoV-2 vaccines are based on the spike antigen, and although they have shown extraordinary efficacy at preventing severe lung disease and death, they do not always confer sterilizing immune protection. We performed studies in K18-hACE2 mice to evaluate whether the efficacy of SARS CoV-2 vaccines could be augmented by incorporating nucleocapsid as a vaccine antigen. We vaccinated mice with adenovirus-based vaccines encoding spike antigen alone, nucleocapsid antigen alone, or combined spike and nucleocapsid antigens. Mice were then challenged intranasally with SARS CoV-2, and acute viral loads were quantified at a proximal site of infection (lung) and a distal site of infection (brain). Interestingly, the spike-based vaccine conferred acute protection in the lung, but not in the brain. The spike-based vaccine conferred acute protection in the brain only if combined with the nucleocapsid-based vaccine. These findings suggest that nucleocapsid-specific immunity is important for the distal control of SARS CoV-2, warranting the inclusion of nucleocapsid in next-generation COVID-19 vaccines.",NA,178,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.26.440920v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.26.440920v1.full.pdf

In the present contribution we study, by all-atom equilibrium and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations, the interaction between the SARS Unique Domain and RNA guanine quadruplexes, a process involved in eluding the defensive response of the host thus favoring viral infection of human cells. Our results evidence two stable binding modes involving an interaction site spanning either the protein dimer interface or only one monomer. The free energy profile unequivocally points to the dimer mode as the thermodynamically favored one. The effect of these binding modes in stabilizing the protein dimer was also assessed, being related to its biological role in assisting SARS viruses to bypass the host protective response. This work also constitutes a first step of the possible rational design of efficient therapeutic agents aiming at perturbing the interaction between SARS Unique Domain and guanine quadruplexes, hence enhancing the host defenses against the virus.

Not only do such molecules often fulfil critical biological functions, but also, they may alter the binding of newly designed drugs. In crystal structures, sites consistently occupied in each unit cell yield electron density clouds that represent water molecule presence. These are recorded in virtually all high-resolution structures obtained through X-ray diffraction. In this work, we utilized the wealth of data from the RCSB Protein Data Bank to train a residual deep learning model named  hotWater to identify sites on the surface of proteins that are most likely to bind water, the so-called water hot spots. The model can be used to score existing water molecules from a PDB file to provide their ranking according to the predicted binding strength or to scan the surface of a protein to determine the most likely water hot-spots de novo. This is computationally much more efficient than currently used molecular dynamics simulations. Based on testing the model on three example proteins, which have been resolved using both high-resolution X-ray crystallography (providing accurate positions of trapped waters) as well as low-resolution X-ray diffraction, NMR or CryoEM (where structure refinement does not yield water positions), we were able to show that the hotWater method is able to recover in the ""water-free"" structures many water binding sites known from the high-resolution structures. A blind test on a newly solved protein structure with waters removed from the PDB also showed good prediction of the crystal water positions.

The viral spike (S) glycoprotein binds the receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) ACE2 and promotes SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. The trimeric S protein binds the receptor using the distal receptor-binding domain (RBD) causing conformational changes in S protein that allow priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling the dynamic structural features used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal novel therapeutic targets. Using structures determined by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, we performed structural analysis and atomic comparisons of the different conformational states adopted by the SARS-CoV-2-RBD.

ResultsHere, we determined the key structural components induced by the receptor and characterized their intramolecular interactions. We show that {kappa}-helix (also known as polyproline II) is a predominant structure in the binding interface and in facilitating the conversion to the active form of the S protein. We demonstrate a series of conversions between switch-like {kappa}-helix and {beta}-strand, and conformational variations in a set of short -helices which affect the proximal hinge region. This conformational changes lead to an alternating pattern in conserved disulfide bond configurations positioned at the hinge, indicating a possible disulfide exchange, an important allosteric switch implicated in viral entry of various viruses, including HIV and murine coronavirus. The structural information presented herein enables us to inspect and understand the important dynamic features of SARS-CoV-2-RBD and propose a novel potential therapeutic strategy to block viral entry.

From the molecular dynamics, we noticed that the RMSF averages in the P.2 strain were more expressive in comparison to the ACE2-RBD wild-type and consequently some regions have undergone more expressive conformational changes although, in general, a greater stabilization of the complex was perceived. In addition, was an increase in the average number of Hydrogen bonds generating a lower RMSD and greater system compaction measured by Radius of Gyration (Rg). The change in native contacts was also important where the decrease from 0.992 {+/-} 0.002 to 0.988 {+/-} 0.002 reflects structural changes, which could reflect in greater transmissibility and difficulty in recognizing neutralizing antibodies. Through the MM-PBSA decomposition, we found that Van der Waals interactions predominated and were more favorable when the structure has mutations of the P.2 lineage. Therefore we believe that the greater stabilization of the ACE2-RBD complex may be a plausible explanation of why some mutations are converging in different lineages such as E484K and N501Y.",NA,23,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.09.439181v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.09.439181v1.full.pdf

However, animal immunization is inherently slow, has poor compatibility with certain antigens (e.g., integral membrane proteins), and suffers from self-tolerance and immunodominance, which limit the functional spectrum of antibodies that can be obtained. Here, we describe Autonomous Hypermutation yEast surfAce Display (AHEAD), a synthetic recombinant antibody generation technology that imitates somatic hypermutation inside engineered yeast. In AHEAD, antibody fragments are encoded on an error-prone orthogonal DNA replication system, resulting in Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations that continuously mutate surface-displayed antibody repertoires. Simple cycles of yeast culturing and enrichment for antigen binding drive the evolution of high-affinity antibody clones in a readily parallelizable process that takes as little as 2 weeks. We applied AHEAD to generate nanobodies against the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, a GPCR, and other targets. The SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies, concurrently evolved from an open-source naive nanobody library in 8 independent experiments, reached subnanomolar affinities through the sequential fixation of multiple mutations over 3-8 AHEAD cycles that saw [~]580-fold and [~]925-fold improvements in binding affinities and pseudovirus neutralization potencies, respectively.

SUMMARY ANSWERACE2 protein is highly expressed in human endometrial stromal cells during the secretory phase and is essential for human endometrial stromal cell decidualization.

WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADYACE2 is expressed in numerous human tissues including the lungs, heart, intestine, kidneys and placenta. ACE2 is also the receptor by which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells.

STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATIONProliferative (n = 9) and secretory (n = 6) phase endometrium biopsies from healthy reproductive-age women and primary human endometrial stromal cells from proliferative phase endometrium were used in the study.

PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODSACE2 expression and localization were examined by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence in both human endometrial samples and mouse uterine tissue. The effect of ACE2 knockdown on morphological and molecular changes of human endometrial stromal cell decidualization were assessed. Ovariectomized mice were treated with estrogen or progesterone to determine the effects of these hormones on ACE2 expression.

MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCEIn human tissue, ACE2 protein is expressed in both endometrial epithelial and stromal cells in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, and expression increases in stromal cells in the secretory phase. The ACE2 mRNA (P < 0.0001) and protein abundance increased during primary human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) decidualization. HESCs transfected with ACE2-targeting siRNA were less able to decidualize than controls, as evidenced by a lack of morphology change and lower expression of the decidualization markers PRL and IGFBP1 (P < 0.05). In mice during pregnancy, ACE2 protein was expressed in uterine epithelial and stromal cells increased through day six of pregnancy. Finally, progesterone induced expression of Ace2 mRNA in mouse uteri more than vehicle or estrogen (P < 0.05).

LARGE SCALE DATAN/A.

LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTIONExperiments assessing the function of ACE2 in human endometrial stromal cell decidualization were in vitro. Whether SARS-CoV-2 can enter human endometrial stromal cells and affect decidualization have not been assessed.

WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGSExpression of ACE2 in the endometrium allow SARS-CoV-2 to enter endometrial epithelial and stromal cells, which could impair in vivo decidualization, embryo implantation, and placentation. If so, women with COVID-19 may be at increased risk of early pregnancy loss.

However, investigation of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the native cellular context is scarce, and there is a lack of comprehensive knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 replicative cycle. Understanding the genome replication, assembly and egress of SARS-CoV-2, a multistage process that involves different cellular compartments and the activity of many viral and cellular proteins, is critically important as it bears the means of medical intervention to stop infection. Here, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells under the near-native frozen-hydrated condition using a unique correlative multi-modal, multi-scale cryo-imaging approach combining soft X-ray cryo-tomography and serial cryoFIB/SEM volume imaging of the entire SARS-CoV-2 infected cell with cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) of cellular lamellae and cell periphery, as well as structure determination of viral components by subtomogram averaging. Our results reveal at the whole cell level profound cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, exemplified by a large amount of heterogeneous vesicles in the cytoplasm for RNA synthesis and virus assembly, formation of membrane tunnels through which viruses exit, and drastic cytoplasm invasion into nucleus. Furthermore, cryoET of cell lamellae reveals how viral RNAs are transported from double-membrane vesicles where they are synthesized to viral assembly sites; how viral spikes and RNPs assist in virus assembly and budding; and how fully assembled virus particles exit the cell, thus stablishing a model of SARS-CoV-2 genome replication, virus assembly and egress pathways.",NA,444,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.05.370239v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.05.370239v1.full.pdf

Recombinant protein-based subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been reported with the use of the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the prefusion spike trimers (S-2P). Recently, a new version of prefusion spike trimers, so called ""HexaPro"", has been shown for its physical property to possess two RBD in the ""up"" conformation, as opposed to just one exposed RBD found in S-2P. Importantly, this HexaPro spike antigen is more stable than S-2P, raising its feasibility for global logistics and supply chain.

However, due to the high number of animal species, it is not feasible to screen all the species in the laboratory. Given that the recognition of the binding ACE2 proteins is the first step for the coronaviruses to invade host cells, we proposed a computational pipeline to identify potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and host ACE2. Using this pipeline, we systematically examined 285 ACE2 variants from mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, and found that the binding energies calculated on the modeled Spike-RBD/ACE2 complex structures correlate closely with the effectiveness of animal infections as determined by multiple experimental datasets. Built on the optimized binding affinity cutoff, we suggested a set of 96 mammals, including 48 experimentally investigated ones, which are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, with candidates from primates, rodents, and carnivores at the highest risk of infection. Overall, this work not only suggested a limited range of potential intermediate SARS-CoV-2 hosts for further experimental investigation; but more importantly, it proposed a new structure-based approach to general zoonotic origin and susceptibility analyses that are critical for human infectious disease control and wildlife protection.",10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00717,382,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.293449v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.293449v1.full.pdf

In agreement with an experimental study, we find a high affinity of the hexapeptide to the binding interface between the spike receptor protein and ACE2, which we investigate using 20 independent equilibrium MD simulations over a total of 1 s and a 200 ns enhanced MD simulation. We then evaluate the effect of the hexapeptide on the aggregation process of the spike receptor protein to ACE2 in long-time enhanced MD simulations. In that set of simulations, we find that the spike receptor protein does not bind to ACE2 with the binding motif shown in experiments, but it rotates due to an electrostatic repulsion and forms a hydrophobic interface with ACE2. Surprisingly, we observe that the hexapeptide binds to the spike receptor domain, which has the effect that this protein only weakly attaches to ACE2, so that the activation of the spike protein receptor might be inhibited in this case. Our results indicate that the hexapeptide might be a possible treatment option which prevents the viral activation through the inhibition of the interaction between ACE2 and the spike receptor protein.

Cryo-EM characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer in complex with the H014 Fab fragment unveiled a novel conformational epitope, which is only accessible when the RBD is in open conformation. Biochemical, cellular, virological and structural studies demonstrated that H014 prevents attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to its host cell receptors. Epitope analysis of available neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 uncover broad cross-protective epitopes. Our results highlight a key role for antibody-based therapeutic interventions in the treatment of COVID-19.

The data analysis highlighted 122 mutations, including 120 single nucleotide variations (SNV), and 2 deletions. Among the 122 mutations, there were 71 singletons, and 51 recurrent mutations. A total of 16 mutations, including 5 nonsynonymous mutations, were detected in spike protein. Notably, the spike protein missense mutation D614G was observed in 31 genomes. The phylogenetic analysis revealed majority of the genomes (36) classified as B lineage, where 2 genomes were from B.6 lineage, 5 genomes from B.1 ancestral lineage and remaining from B.1 sub-lineages. It was noteworthy that three clusters of B.1 sub-lineages were observed, including B.1.36 lineage (10 genomes), B.1.160 lineage (11 genomes), and B.1.255 lineage (5 genomes), which represent independent events of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within the city.

The virus spike glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins are the main targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, to control the disease spread. We herein study the structural order-disorder propensity and the rates of evolution of these two proteins to characterize their B cell and T cell epitopes, previously suggested to contribute to immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections. We first analyzed the rates of evolution along the sequences of spike and nucleocapsid proteins in relation to the spatial locations of their epitopes. For this purpose, we compared orthologs from seven human coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. We then focus on the local, structural order-disorder propensities of the protein regions where the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes are located. We show that the vast majority of nucleocapsid protein epitopes overlap the RNA-binding and dimerization domains and some of them are characterized by low rates of evolutions. Similarly, spike protein epitopes are preferentially located in regions that are predicted to be ordered and well-conserved, in correspondence of the heptad repeats 1 and 2. Interestingly, both the receptor-binding motif to ACE2 and the fusion peptide of spike protein are characterized by high rates of evolution, probably to overcome host immunity.

Thus, effective measures are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in indoor environments. In this regard, we have investigated whether a system based on a filter combining Tungsten Trioxide-Based (WO3) photocatalysis and an antiviral fabric treated-copper nanocluster could inactivate SARS-CoV-2. To this purpose, an infectious SARS-CoV-2 suspension was introduced in the upper opening of a closed cylinder containing a WO3 filter and a lightbased system that activates WO3 and the antiviral fabric. From the bottom exit, aliquots of fluid were collected every 10 min (up to 60 min) and tested for their infectivity by means of a viral plaque assay in Vero cells whereas, in parallel, the viral RNA content was measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR). As we have previously shown for SARS-CoV, a 1:1,000 ratio of plaque forming units (PFU) vs. viral RNA copies was observed also for SARS-CoV-2. After 10 min, the infectious viral content was already decreased by 98.2% reaching 100% inactivation after 30 min whereas the SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was decreased of 1.5 log10 after 30 min.

For fruitful and rapid investigation of viral pathomechanisms, a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach is required. Therefore, we have developed ViralLink: a systems biology workflow which reconstructs and analyses networks representing the effect of viruses on intracellular signalling. These networks trace the flow of signal from intracellular viral proteins through their human binding proteins and downstream signalling pathways, ending with transcription factors regulating genes differentially expressed upon viral exposure. In this way, the workflow provides a mechanistic insight from previously identified knowledge of virally infected cells. By default, the workflow is set up to analyse the intracellular effects of SARS-CoV-2, requiring only transcriptomics counts data as input from the user: thus, encouraging and enabling rapid multidisciplinary research. However, the wide-ranging applicability and modularity of the workflow facilitates customisation of viral context, a priori interactions and analysis methods. Through a case study of SARS-CoV-2 infected bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells, we evidence the functionality of the workflow and its ability to identify key pathways and proteins in the cellular response to infection. The application of ViralLink to different viral infections in a cell-type specific manner using different available transcriptomics datasets will uncover key mechanisms in viral pathogenesis. The workflow is available on GitHub (https://github.com/korcsmarosgroup/ViralLink) in an easily accessible Python wrapper script, or as customisable modular R and Python scripts.Author summary Collaborative and multidisciplinary science provides increased value for experimental datasets and speeds the process of discovery.

Through integration of gene expression datasets with context-specific and context-agnostic molecular interaction datasets, the workflow can be easily applied to different datasets as they are made available.

This clinical figure is significantly different from that of anosmia after upper respiratory infection, which occurs in only a small proportion of patients and does not recover or requires months to recover. The background mechanisms of COVID-19 induced olfactory dysfunction have not been elucidated.Methods To address the unique pathophysiology of olfactory dysfunction associated with COVID-19, we examined the existence and distribution of ACE2 (virus binding receptor), TMPRSS2 and Furin (proteases to facilitate virus entry) in the nasal mucosa, composed of the respiratory mucosa (RM) and olfactory mucosa (OM), and the olfactory bulb (OB) in mouse and human tissues by immunohistochemistry and gene analyses.Results Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin gene expressions were confirmed in the nasal mucosa and OB. ACE2 was widely expressed all in the RM, OM and OB. Co-expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and Furin was observed in the RM including the RE and subepithelial glands and in the OM, especially in the supporting cells on the olfactory epithelium and the Bowman’s glands. Notably, the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in the OM were positive for ACE2 but almost negative for TMPRSS2 and Furin. The cells in the OB expressed ACE2 strongly and Furin weakly and did not express TMPRSS2.Conclusions ACE2 was widely expressed in the RM, OM and OB, but TMPRSS2 and Furin were expressed in certain types of cells and were absent in the ORNs. These findings, together with clinically reported ones, suggest that COVID-19 related anosmia can occur due to mainly sensorineural and central dysfunction and, to some extent, conductive olfactory dysfunction. That the ORNs express ACE2 but not TMPRSS2 or Furin may explain the early recovery of anosmia.Short Summary Protein expression patterns of ACE2, TMPRSS, and Furin suggest that COVID-19 related anosmia can occur due to mainly sensorineural dysfunction without olfactory neuronal damage.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",10.4193/rhin20.324,117,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.15.097352v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.15.097352v2.full.pdf

Despite the implementation of new automated detection systems, and previous efficiencies such as barcoding, electronic data transfer and extensive robotics, throughput capacities have struggled to meet the demand. Sample pooling has been suggested as an additional strategy to further address this need. The greatest concern with this approach in a clinical setting is the potential for reduced sensitivity, particularly the risk of false negative results when weak positive samples are pooled. To investigate this possibility, detection rates in pooled samples were evaluated, with extensive assessment of pools containing weak positive specimens. Additionally, the frequency of occurrence of weak positive samples across ten weeks of the pandemic were reviewed. Weak positive specimens were detected in all five-sample pools but failed to be detected in four of the 24 nine-sample pools tested. Weak positive samples comprised an average 16.5% of the positive specimens tested during the pandemic thus far, slightly increasing in frequency during later weeks. Other aspects of the testing process should be considered, however, such as accessioning and reporting, which are not streamlined and may be complicated by pooling procedures. Therefore, the impact on the entire laboratory process needs to be carefully assessed prior to implementing such a strategy.",10.1128/JCM.01261-20,483,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.26.118133v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.26.118133v1.full.pdf

However, remdesivir confers only mild benefits to a subset of patients, and additional effective therapeutic options are needed. Drug repurposing and drug combinations may represent practical strategies to address these urgent unmet medical needs. Viruses, including coronaviruses, are known to hijack the host metabolism to facilitate their own proliferation, making targeting host metabolism a promising antiviral approach. Here, we describe an integrated analysis of 12 published in vitro and human patient gene expression datasets on SARS-CoV-2 infection using genome-scale metabolic modeling (GEM). We find that SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce recurrent and complicated metabolic reprogramming spanning a wide range of metabolic pathways. We next applied the GEM-based metabolic transformation algorithm (MTA) to predict anti-SARS-CoV-2 targets that counteract the virus-induced metabolic changes. These predictions are enriched for validated targets from various published experimental drug and genetic screens. Further analyzing the RNA-sequencing data of remdesivir-treated Vero E6 cell samples that we generated, we predicted metabolic targets that act in combination with remdesivir. These predictions are enriched for previously reported synergistic drugs with remdesivir. Since our predictions are based in part on human patient data, they are likely to be clinically relevant.

Among them, 14408 C>T and 23403 A>G mutations in RdRp and S, respectively, became dominant in Europe and the US, which led to debates regarding their effects on the mutability and transmissibility of the virus. In this study, we aimed to investigate possible differences between time-dependent variation of mutation densities (MDe) of viral strains that carry these two mutations and those that do not. Our analyses at the genome and gene level led to two important findings: First, time-dependent changes in the average MDe of circulating SARS-CoV-2 genomes showed different characteristics before and after the beginning of April, when daily new case numbers started levelling off. Second, this pattern was much delayed or even non-existent for the ""mutant"" (MT) strain that harbored both 14408 C>T and 23403 A>G mutations. Although these differences were not limited to a few hotspots, it is intriguing that the MDe increase is most evident in two critical genes, S and Orf1ab, which are also the genes that harbor the defining mutations of the MT genotype.

While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear, the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been little studied.

MethodsThirty-five aerosol samples of three different types (total suspended particle, size segregated and deposition aerosol) were collected in Patient Areas (PAA) and Medical Staff Areas (MSA) of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Renmin) and Wuchang Fangcang Field Hospital (Fangcang), and Public Areas (PUA) in Wuhan, China during COVID-19 outbreak. A robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method was employed to quantitate the viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and determine aerosol RNA concentration.

ResultsThe ICU, CCU and general patient rooms inside Renmin, patient hall inside Fangcang had undetectable or low airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but deposition samples inside ICU and air sample in Fangcang patient toilet tested positive. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 in Fangcang MSA had bimodal distribution with higher concentration than those in Renmin during the outbreak but turned negative after patients number reduced and rigorous sanitization implemented. PUA had undetectable airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but obviously increased with accumulating crowd flow.

ConclusionsRoom ventilation, open space, proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Gathering of crowds with asymptomatic carriers is a potential source of airborne SARS-CoV-2. The virus aerosol deposition on protective apparel or floor surface and their subsequent resuspension is a potential transmission pathway and effective sanitization is critical in minimizing aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",NA,341,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.08.982637v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.08.982637v1.full.pdf

Little is known about the pattern of SARS-CoV-2 specific pre-existing memory T cells in human. Here, we first studied T cell responses to structural (nucleocapsid protein, NP) and non-structural (NSP-7 and NSP13 of ORF1) regions of SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent from COVID-19 (n=24). In all of them we demonstrated the presence of CD4 and CD8 T cells recognizing multiple regions of the NP protein. We then show that SARS-recovered patients (n=23), 17 years after the 2003 outbreak, still possess long-lasting memory T cells reactive to SARS-NP, which displayed robust cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 NP. Surprisingly, we observed a differential pattern of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell immunodominance in individuals with no history of SARS, COVID-19 or contact with SARS/COVID-19 patients (n=18). Half of them (9/18) possess T cells targeting the ORF-1 coded proteins NSP7 and 13, which were rarely detected in COVID-19- and SARS-recovered patients. Epitope characterization of NSP7-specific T cells showed recognition of protein fragments with low homology to ""common cold"" human coronaviruses but conserved among animal betacoranaviruses.

Thus, infection with betacoronaviruses induces strong and long-lasting T cell immunity to the structural protein NP.

Variants of Concern (VOCs) and Variants of Interest (VOIs) are lineages that represent a greater risk to public health, and can be differentiated from the wildtype virus based on unique profiles of signature mutations. Metagenomic sequence analysis of wastewater represents an emerging form of surveillance that can capture early signal for these variants in a community prior to detection through public health testing or genomic surveillance activities. However, because multiple viral genomes are likely to be present in a metagenomic sample, additional analytical scrutiny of the sequencing reads beyond variant calling is needed to increase confidence in diagnostic determinations.

ResultsWhere multiple signature mutations are present on a given read, they can be used as enhanced biomarkers to confirm the presence of a VOC/VOI in the sample. We have developed MMMVI, a tool to aggregate and report on the likely presence of a VOC/VOI in a set of metagenomic reads based on the detection of reads bearing multiple signature mutations.

Whole genome sequencing based on NGS technologies is the method of choice to identify all viral variants; however, the resources needed to use these techniques for a representative number of specimens remain limited in many low and middle income countries. To decrease sequencing cost, we developed a couple of primers allowing to generate partial sequences in the viral S gene allowing rapid detection of numerous variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs); whole genome sequencing is then performed on a selection of viruses based on partial sequencing results. Two hundred and one nasopharyngeal specimens collected during the decreasing phase of a high transmission COVID-19 wave in T unisia were analyzed. The results reveal high genetic variability within the sequenced fragment and allowed the detection of first introduction in the country of already known VOCs and VOIs as well as others variants that have interesting genomic mutations and need to be kept under surveillance.

Forty-four S2P-specific monoclonal antibodies were generated, three of which bound to the receptor binding domain (RBD). The antibodies were minimally mutated from germline and were derived from different B cell lineages. Only two antibodies displayed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-virus. The most potent antibody bound the RBD in a manner that prevented binding to the ACE2 receptor, while the other bound outside the RBD. Our study indicates that the majority of antibodies against the viral envelope spike that were generated during the first weeks of COVID-19 infection are non-neutralizing and target epitopes outside the RBD. Antibodies that disrupt the SARS-CoV-2 spike-ACE2 interaction can potently neutralize the virus without undergoing extensive maturation. Such antibodies have potential preventive/therapeutic potential and can serve as templates for vaccine-design.

IN BRIEFSARS-CoV-2 infection leads to expansion of diverse B cells clones against the viral spike glycoprotein (S). The antibodies bind S with high affinity despite being minimally mutated. Thus, the development of neutralizing antibody responses by vaccination will require the activation of certain naive B cells without requiring extensive somatic mutation.

Our aim was to design a semi-split inactivated vaccine offering a wide range of multi-epitope determinants important for the immune system including not only the spike (S) protein but also the envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. We designed a semi-split vaccine prototype consisting of S protein-depleted viral particles and free S protein. Next, we investigated its immunogenic potential in BALB/c mice. The animals were immunized intradermally or intramuscularly with the dose adjusted with buffer or addition of aluminum hydroxide, respectively. The antibody response was evaluated by plasma analysis at 7 days after the first or second dose. The immune cell response was studied by flow cytometry analysis of splenocytes. The data showed a very early onset of both S protein-specific antibodies and virus-neutralizing antibodies at 90% inhibition regardless of the route of vaccine administration. However, significantly higher levels of neutralizing antibodies were detected in the intradermally (geometric mean titer - GMT of 7.8 {+/-} 1.4) than in the intramuscularly immunized mice (GMT of 6.2 {+/-} 1.5). In accordance with this, stimulation of cellular immunity by the semi-split vaccine was suggested by elevated levels of B and T lymphocyte subpopulations in the murine spleens. These responses were more predominant in the intradermally immunized mice compared with the intramuscular route of administration. The upward trend in the levels of plasmablasts, memory B cells, Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes, including follicular helper T cells, was confirmed even in mice receiving the vaccine intradermally at a dose of 0.5 g.

Modulating eIF4F function through cellular regulation or small-molecule inhibition impacts coronavirus replication, including for SARS-CoV-2. Translation initiation involves highly coordinated dynamics of translation factors with messenger or viral RNA. However, how the eIF4F subunits coordinate on the initiation timescale to define cap-binding efficiency remains incompletely understood. Here we report that translation supported by the SARS-CoV-2 5-UTR is highly sensitive to eIF4A inhibition by rocaglamide. Through a single-molecule fluorescence approach that reports on eIF4E-cap interaction, we dissect how eIF4F subunits contribute to cap-recognition efficiency on the SARS-CoV-2 5 UTR. We find that free eIF4A enhances cap accessibility for eIF4E binding, but eIF4G alone does not change the kinetics of eIF4E-RNA interaction. Conversely, formation of the full eIF4F complex significantly alters eIF4E-cap interaction, suggesting that coordinated eIF4E and eIF4A activities establish the net eIF4F-cap recognition efficiency. Moreover, the eIF4F complex formed with phosphomimetic eIF4E(S209D) binds the viral UTR more efficiently than with wild-type eIF4E.

To determine the binding mode of these calpain inhibitors and establish a structure-activity relationship, we solved X-ray crystal structures of Mpro in complex with calpain inhibitors II and XII, and three analogues of GC-376, one of the most potent Mpro inhibitors in vitro. The structure of Mpro with calpain inhibitor II confirmed the S1 pocket of Mpro can accommodate a hydrophobic methionine side chain, challenging the idea that a hydrophilic residue is necessary at this position. Interestingly, the structure of calpain inhibitor XII revealed an unexpected, inverted binding pose where the P1 pyridine inserts in the S1 pocket and the P1 norvaline is positioned in the S1 pocket.

Development of innovative direct-acting antiviral agents is sorely needed to address this virus. Peptide-conjugated morpholino oligomers (PPMO) are antisense agents composed of a phosphordiamidate morpholino oligomer covalently conjugated to a cell-penetrating peptide. PPMO require no delivery assistance to enter cells and are able to reduce expression of targeted RNA through sequence-specific steric blocking.

Objectives and MethodsFive PPMO designed against sequences of genomic RNA in the SARS-CoV-2 5-untranslated region and a negative control PPMO of random sequence were synthesized. Each PPMO was evaluated for its effect on the viability of uninfected cells and its inhibitory effect on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cell cultures. Cell viability was evaluated with an ATP-based method and viral growth was measured with quantitative RT-PCR and TCID50 infectivity assays.

ResultsPPMO designed to base-pair with sequence in the 5-terminal region or the leader transcription regulatory sequence-region of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA were highly efficacious, reducing viral titers by up to 4-6 log10 in cell cultures at 48-72 hours post-infection, in a non-toxic and dose-responsive manner.

In vivo, treatment with Oseltamivir results in infection control and host survival in peritonitis and pneumonia models of sepsis. Single-cell RNA sequencing re-analysis of publicly data sets of respiratory tract samples from critical COVID-19 patients revealed an overexpression of NEU1 in infiltrated neutrophils. Moreover, Oseltamivir or Zanamivir treatment of whole blood cells from severe COVID-19 patients reduces host NEU-mediated shedding of cell surface sialic acid and neutrophil overactivation. These findings suggest that neuraminidase inhibitors can serve as host-directed interventions to dampen neutrophil dysfunction in severe infections.

Thus, finding new ways to inhibit the exacerbated response of these cells is greatly needed.

The underlying COVID-19 mechanisms engaged by these extra-pulmonary organ systems are largely unknown. We approached this knowledge gap by recognizing that neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 (alternately called NBB, B, B0 in the literature) is a common denominator expressed nearly exclusively by three particular cell types: intestinal epithelia, renal proximal tubule epithelium, and cardiomyocytes. B0AT1 provides uptake of glutamine and tryptophan. The gut is the main depot expressing over 90% of the bodys entire pool of SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and B0AT1. Recent cryo-EM studies established that ACE2 forms a thermodynamically favored dimer-of-heterodimers complex with B0AT1 assembled in the form of a dimer of two ACE2:B0AT1 heterodimers anchored in plasma membranes. Prior epithelial cell studies demonstrated ACE2 chaperone trafficking of B0AT1. This contrasts with monomeric expression of ACE2 in lung pneumocytes, in which B0AT1 is undetectable. The cell types in question also express a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM17) known to cleave and shed the ectodomain of monomeric ACE2 from the cell surface, thereby relinquishing protection against unchecked renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) events of COVID-19. The present study employed molecular docking modeling to examine the interplaying assemblage of ACE2, ADAM17 and B0AT1. We report that in the monomer form of ACE2, neck region residues R652-N718 provide unimpeded access to ADAM17 active site pocket, but notably R708 and S709 remained >10-15 [A] distant. In contrast, interference of ADAM17 docking to ACE2 in a dimer-of-heterodimers arrangement was directly correlated with the presence of a neighboring B0AT1 subunit complexed to the partnering ACE2 subunit of the 2ACE2:2B0AT1] dimer of heterodimers, representing the expression pattern putatively exclusive to intestinal, renal and cardiomyocyte cell types. The monomer and dimer-of-heterodimers docking models were not influenced by the presence of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) complexed to ACE2.

The MPS contained human heart muscle derived from patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells. The effect of drug response was measured using outputs that correlate with clinical measurements such as QT interval (action potential duration) and drug-biomarker pairing.

Chronic exposure to HCQ alone elicited early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and increased QT interval from day 6 onwards. AZM alone elicited an increase in QT interval from day 7 onwards and arrhythmias were observed at days 8 and 10. Monotherapy results closely mimicked clinical trial outcomes. Upon chronic exposure to HCQ and AZM polytherapy, we observed an increase in QT interval on days 4-8.. Interestingly, a decrease in arrhythmias and instabilities was observed in polytherapy relative to monotherapy, in concordance with published clinical trials. Furthermore, biomarkers, most of them measurable in patients serum, were identified for negative effects of single drug or polytherapy on tissue contractile function, morphology, and antioxidant protection.

Current evidence suggests a likely spillover into humans from an animal reservoir. Understanding the host range and identifying animal species that are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection may help to elucidate the origin of the virus and the mechanisms underlying cross-species transmission to humans. Here we demonstrated that white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), an animal species in which the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - the SARS-CoV-2 receptor - shares a high degree of similarity to humans, are highly susceptible to infection. Intranasal inoculation of deer fawns with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in established subclinical viral infection and shedding of infectious virus in nasal secretions. Notably, infected animals transmitted the virus to non-inoculated contact deer. Viral RNA was detected in multiple tissues 21 days post-inoculation (pi). All inoculated and indirect contact animals seroconverted and developed neutralizing antibodies as early as day 7 pi. The work provides important insights into the animal host range of SARS-CoV-2 and identifies white-tailed deer as a susceptible wild animal species to the virus.

IMPORTANCEGiven the presumed zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2, the human-animal-environment interface of COVID-19 pandemic is an area of great scientific and public- and animal-health interest. Identification of animal species that are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 may help to elucidate the potential origin of the virus, identify potential reservoirs or intermediate hosts, and define the mechanisms underlying cross-species transmission to humans. Additionally, it may also provide information and help to prevent potential reverse zoonosis that could lead to the establishment of a new wildlife hosts. Our data show that upon intranasal inoculation, white-tailed deer became subclinically infected and shed infectious SARS-CoV-2 in nasal secretions and feces. Importantly, indirect contact animals were infected and shed infectious virus, indicating efficient SARS-CoV-2 transmission from inoculated animals. These findings support the inclusion of wild cervid species in investigations conducted to assess potential reservoirs or sources of SARS-CoV-2 of infection.",10.1128/jvi.00083-21,102,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.13.426628v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.13.426628v1.full.pdf

At low pH, binding of SARS-CoV and its ACE2 receptor has a tight interaction that catalyzes the fusion of the spike and endosomal membranes followed by genome release. Largely overlooked has been the role of neutral pH in the respiratory tract, where we find that SARS-CoV stabilizes a transition state that enhances the off-rate from its receptor. An alternative pH-switch is found in CoV-2-like coronaviruses of tropical pangolins, but with a reversed phenotype where the tight interaction with ACE2 is at neutral pH. We show that a single point mutation in pangolin-CoV, unique to CoV-2, that deletes the last His residue in their receptor binding domain perpetuates this tight interaction independent of pH. This tight bond, not present in previous respiratory syndromes, implies that CoV-2 stays bound to the highly expressed ACE2 receptors in the nasal cavity about 100 times longer than CoV. This finding supports the unfamiliar pathology of CoV-2, observed virus retention in upper respiratory tract1, longer incubation times and extended periods of shedding.

From pathogenic and epidemiological perspectives, spike proteins are of prime interest to researchers. This study focused on the unique variants of S proteins from six continents Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania, South America, and North America. In comparison to the other five continents, Africa (29.065%) had the highest percentage of unique S proteins. Notably, only North America had 87% (14046) of the total (16143) specific S proteins available in the NCBI database(across all continents). Based on the amino acid frequency distributions in the S protein variants from all the continents, the phylogenetic relationship implies that unique S proteins from North America were significantly different from those of the other five continents. Overtime, the unique variants originating from North America are most likely to spread to the other geographic locations through international travel or naturally by emerging mutations. Hence it is suggested that restriction of international travel should be considered, and massive vaccination as an utmost measure to combat the spread of COVID-19 pandemic.

Mutations in the RBD domain are present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that have emerged independently worldwide. For example, the more transmissible B.1.1.7 lineage has a mutation (N501Y) in its Spike RBD domain that enhances binding to ACE2. There are also ACE2 alleles in humans with mutations in the RBD binding site. Here we perform a detailed affinity and kinetics analysis of the effect of five common RBD mutations (K417N, K417T, N501Y, E484K and S477N) and two common ACE2 mutations (S19P and K26R) on the RBD/ACE2 interaction. We analysed the effects of individual RBD mutations, and combinations found in new SARS-CoV-2 variants first identified in the UK (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P1). Most of these mutations increased the affinity of the RBD/ACE2 interaction. The exceptions were mutations K417N/T, which decreased the affinity. Taken together with other studies, our results suggest that the N501Y and S477N mutations primarily enhance transmission, the K417N/T mutations facilitate immune escape, and the E484K mutation facilitates both transmission and immune escape.",NA,149,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.18.444646v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.18.444646v1.full.pdf

In recent months, variants of SARS-CoV-2 have raised concerns that viral mutation may undermine vaccination efforts through viral escape of host immune memory acquired from infection or vaccination. We therefore used a computational approach to predict changes in spike protein antigenicity with respect to host B cell and CD8+ T cell immunity across six SARS-CoV-2 variants (D614G, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.429, and mink-related).

MethodsManuscripts deposited at bioRxiv and medRxiv between January 1 and September 27 were assessed for the probability of publishing in peer-reviewed journals, and those published were evaluated for submission-to-acceptance time. The extent of public discussion was assessed based on Altmetric and Disqus data. The Retraction Watch Database and PubMed were used to explore the retraction of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 articles and preprints.

ResultsWith adjustment for the preprinting server and number of deposited versions, COVID-19-related preprints were more likely to be published within 120 days since the deposition of the first version (OR=2.04, 95%CI 1.87-2.23) as well as over the entire observed period (OR=1.42, 95%CI 1.33-1.52).

A possible explanation for this might be the differences in immunological profiles in males and the elderly before the infection. Given the seasonal profile of COVID-19, the seasonal response against SARS-CoV-2 could also be different in these groups.

MethodsThe abundance of circulating proteins and immune populations associated with severe COVID-19 was analyzed in 2 healthy cohorts. PBMCs of female, male, young, and old subjects in different seasons of the year were stimulated with heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2.

ResultSeveral T cell subsets, which are known to be depleted in severe COVID-19 patients, were intrinsically less abundant in men and older individuals. Plasma proteins increasing with disease severity, including HGF, IL-8, and MCP-1, were more abundant in the elderly and males. The elderly produced significantly more IL-1RA and had a dysregulated IFN{gamma} response with lower production in the summer compared with young individuals.

ConclusionsThe immune characteristics of severe COVID-19, described by a differential abundance of immune cells and circulating inflammatory proteins, are intrinsically present in healthy men and the elderly. This might explain the susceptibility of men and the elderly to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Proteolytic cleavages of the spike S protein of SARS-CoV-2, mediated by the host cell proteases cathepsin and TMPRSS2, alone or in combination, are key early activation steps required for efficient infection. The PIKfyve kinase inhibitor apilimod interferes with late endosomal viral traffic, and through an ill-defined mechanism prevents in vitro infection through late endosomes mediated by cathepsin. Similarly, inhibition of TMPRSS2 protease activity by camostat mesylate or nafamostat mesylate prevents infection mediated by the TMPRSS2-dependent and cathepsin-independent pathway. Here, we combined the use of apilimod with camostat mesylate or nafamostat mesylate and found an unexpected [~]5-10 fold increase in their effectiveness to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in different cell types. Comparable synergism was observed using both, a chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) containing S of SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV-2 virus. The substantial [~]5 fold or more decrease of half maximal effective concentrations (EC50 values) suggests a plausible treatment strategy based on the combined use of these inhibitors.

IMPORTANCEInfection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) global pandemic. There are ongoing efforts to uncover effective antiviral agents that could mitigate the severity of the disease by controlling the ensuing viral replication. Promising candidates include small molecules that inhibit the enzymatic activities of host proteins, thus preventing SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection. They include Apilimod, an inhibitor of PIKfyve kinase and camostat mesylate and nafamostat mesylate, inhibitors of TMPRSS2 protease.

Mammalian display screening is employed to reveal that 37 antibodies (out of 132 candidates) derived from expanded plasma cell clonal lineages are specific for SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including antibodies that target the receptor binding domain (RBD) with high affinity and exhibit potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2.

Emerging mutations can affect viral properties such as infectivity and immune resistance. Although the sensitivity of naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variants to humoral immunity has recently been investigated, that to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted cellular immunity remains unaddressed. Here we demonstrate that two recently emerging mutants in the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, L452R (in B.1.427/429) and Y453F (in B.1.298), can escape from the HLA-24-restricted cellular immunity. These mutations reinforce the affinity to viral receptor ACE2, and notably, the L452R mutation increases protein stability, viral infectivity, and potentially promotes viral replication. Our data suggest that the HLA-restricted cellular immunity potentially affects the evolution of viral phenotypes, and the escape from cellular immunity can be a further threat of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Initial contact with the host cell and membrane fusion are both mediated by the viral spike (S) protein. Proteolytic cleavage of S at the S2' site exposes its 40 amino acid long fusion peptide (FP). Binding of the FP to the host membrane anchors the S2 domain of S in both the viral and the host membrane. The reorganization of S2 then pulls the two membranes together. Here we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the two core functions of the SARS-CoV-2 FP: to attach quickly to cellular membranes and to form an anchor strong enough to withstand the mechanical force during membrane fusion. In eight 10 s-long MD simulations of FP in proximity to endosomal and plasma membranes, we find that FP binds spontaneously to the membranes and that binding proceeds predominantly by insertion of two short amphipathic helices into the membrane interface. Connected via a flexible linker, the two helices can bind the membrane independently, yet binding of one promotes the binding of the other by tethering it close to the target membrane. By simulating mechanical pulling forces acting on the C-terminus of the FP we then show that the bound FP can bear forces up to 250 pN before detaching from the membrane. This detachment force is more than ten-fold higher than an estimate of the force required to pull host and viral membranes together for fusion. We identify a fully conserved disulfide bridge in the FP as a major factor for the high mechanical stability of the FP membrane anchor. We conclude, first, that the sequential binding of two short amphipathic helices allows the SARS-CoV-2 FP to insert quickly into the target membrane, before the virion is swept away after shedding the S1 domain connecting it to the host cell receptor. Second, we conclude that the double attachment and the conserved disulfide bridge establish the strong anchoring required for subsequent membrane fusion. Multiple distinct membrane-anchoring elements ensure high avidity and high mechanical strength of FP-membrane binding.",NA,187,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.10.443474v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.10.443474v1.full.pdf

MethodsEighteen time series fecal samples were collected from nine COVID-19 patients during the convalescent phase. The nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2 were enriched by the hybrid capture method with different rounds of hybridization.

ResultsBy examining the sequencing depth, genome coverage, and allele frequency change, we demonstrated the impeccable performance of the hybrid capture method in samples with Ct value < 34, as well as significant improvement comparing to direct metatranscriptomic sequencing in samples with lower viral loads. We identified 229 intra-host variants at 182 sites in 18 fecal samples.

Diet-induced obese and lean control C57BL/6N mice, transduced for ACE2 expression using replication-defective adenovirus, were infected with SARS-CoV-2, and monitored for lung pathology, viral titers, and cytokine expression. No significant differences in tissue pathology, viral replication or cytokine expression were observed between lean and obese groups. Notably, significant weight loss was observed in obese mice treated with the adenovirus vector, independent of SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting an obesity-dependent morbidity induced by the vector. These data indicate that the adenovirus-transduced mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection is inadequate for performing nutrition studies, and caution should be used when interpreting resulting data.",NA,138,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.26.445786v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.26.445786v1.full.pdf

The analyses showed non-significant evolutionary divergences within and between the six countries, as well as a significant similarity to the time of genetic evolutionary divergence between all populations. Thus, it seems safe to affirm that we will find similar results for the other Countries of South America, reducing speculation about the existence of rapid and silent mutations that, although there are as we have shown in this work, do not increase, until this moment, the genetic variability of the Virus, a fact that would hinder the work with molecular targets for vaccines and drugs in general.",NA,317,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.14.296491v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.14.296491v1.full.pdf

The zebrafish genome has a highly conserved, one-to-one ortholog of ACE2, i.e., ace2, whose expression profile however has not yet been studied during development or in pathologies relevant to COVID-19. Herein, we identified significant development-, tissue- and gender-specific modulations in ace2 expression based on meta-analysis of zebrafish Affymetrix transcriptomics datasets (ndatasets=107, GPL1319 in GEO database). Co-expression network analysis of ace2 revealed distinct positively correlated (carboxypeptidase activity and fibrin clot formation), and negatively correlated (cilia biogenesis/transport and chromatin modifications) STRING network modules. Using additional transcriptomics datasets, we showed zebrafish embryos before 3 days post fertilization (dpf) exhibited low levels of ace2 that increased significantly until 4 dpf implicating a role for ace2 in organogenesis. Re-analysis of RNA-seq datasets from zebrafish adult tissues demonstrated ace2 was expressed highly in intestines, variably in liver, and at lower levels in other organs. In addition, zebrafish females and males showed significant dimorphism in their age-dependent expression of ace2, and between ovary and testis where the latter had higher levels. Moreover, we demonstrated ace2 expression was significantly modulated under different physiological and pathological conditions associated with development, diet, infection, and inflammation. Our findings implicate a novel translational role for zebrafish ace2 in differentiation and pathologies predominantly found in intestines and liver, in which the effects of SARS-CoV-2 could be detrimental.",NA,272,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.24.424209v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.24.424209v1.full.pdf

Here, we demonstrate that engineering approaches can be used to refocus an existing neutralizing antibody to a related but resistant virus. Using a rapid affinity maturation strategy, we engineered CR3022, a SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibody, to bind SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain with >1000-fold improved affinity. The engineered CR3022 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 and provided prophylactic protection from viral challenge in a small animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Deep sequencing throughout the engineering process paired with crystallographic analysis of an enhanced antibody elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which engineered CR3022 can accommodate sequence differences in the epitope between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. The workflow described provides a blueprint for rapid broadening of neutralization of an antibody from one virus to closely related but resistant viruses.",NA,54,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.29.443900v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.29.443900v1.full.pdf
