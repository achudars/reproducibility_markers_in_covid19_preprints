M.; Tafess, K.",Edessa Negera,Arsi University,2020-07-24,2,cc_by,Animal Behavior And Cognition,"COVID-19 has a potential to cause chaos in Ethiopia due to the countrys already daunting economic and social challenges. Living and working conditions are highly conducive for transmission, as people live in crowded inter-generational households that often lack running water and other basic sanitary facilities. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of Ethiopians toward COVID-19 following the introduction of state of emergency by the Ethiopian government to curb the spread of the disease. A cross-sectional study design was conducted in nine reginal states and two chartered cities. Data for demographic, Knowledge, attitude and practice toward COVID-19 were collected through telephone interview from 1570 participants. Descriptive and bivariate analyses using chi-square test, t-test or analysis of variance were performed as appropriate. Binary and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to measure the relationship between the categorical dependent variables and one or more socio-demographic independent variables with two-tailed at =0.05 significance level and 95% of confidence interval. The level of good knowledge, favourable attitude and good practice among the respondents were 42%, 53.8% and 24.3% respectively. Being rural resident, older than 50 years, having at least primary education, being resident of Amhara and Oromia regions were independent predictors of knowledge level. While being rural resident, married, employed, having at least basic education, being residents of Afar, Amhara, Gambela, Oromia and Somali regions were found to be the best predictors of the attitude, being rural resident, government employee, having at least basic education, and living outside of the capital were the independent predictors of practice level of the respondents. The finding revealed that Ethiopians have inadequate level of knowledge and are generally have a mixed outlook on overcoming the pandemic with poor adherence to COVID-19 prevention practice. reinforcing preventive measures and intensifying sensitization campaigns to fill the knowledge gap and persuading people to follow the preventive measures set by the government with concurrent evaluation of the impacts of these measures on knowledge and practice is highly recommended to mitigate the disease.","NA",281,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.215590v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.215590v2.full.pdf

B.; Wong, P.; Simonov, M.; Yamamoto, Y.; Van Dijk, D.; Wilson, F. P.; Iwasaki, A.; Krishnaswamy, S.",Smita Krishnaswamy,Yale University,2020-08-22,1,cc_by_nd,Bioinformatics,"In many important contexts involving measurements of biological entities, there are distinct categories of information: some information is easy-to-obtain information (EI) and can be gathered on virtually every subject of interest, while other information is hard-to-obtain information (HI) and can only be gathered on some of the biological samples. For example, in the context of drug discovery, measurements like the chemical structure of a drug are EI, while measurements of the transcriptome of a cell population perturbed with the drug is HI. In the clinical context, basic health monitoring is EI because it is already being captured as part of other processes, while cellular measurements like flow cytometry or even ultimate patient outcome are HI. We propose building a model to make probabilistic predictions of HI from EI on the samples that have both kinds of measurements, which will allow us to generalize and predict the HI on a large set of samples from just the EI. To accomplish this, we present a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) framework we call the Feature Mapping GAN (FMGAN). By using the EI as conditions to map to the HI, we demonstrate that FMGAN can accurately predict the HI, with heterogeneity in cases of distributions of HI from EI. We show that FMGAN is flexible in that it can learn rich and complex mappings from EI to HI, and can take into account manifold structure in the EI space where available. We demonstrate this in a variety of contexts including generating RNA sequencing results on cell lines subjected to drug perturbations using drug chemical structure, and generating clinical outcomes from patient lab measurements. Most notably, we are able to generate synthetic flow cytometry data from clinical variables on a cohort of COVID-19 patients--effectively describing their immune response in great detail, and showcasing the power of generating expensive FACS data from ubiquitously available patient monitoring data.

Bigger PictureMany experiments face a trade-off between gathering easy-to-collect information on many samples or hard-to-collect information on a smaller number of small due to costs in terms of both money and time. We demonstrate that a mapping between the easy-to-collect and hard-to-collect information can be trained as a conditional GAN from a subset of samples with both measured. With our conditional GAN model known as Feature-Mapping GAN (FMGAN), the results of expensive experiments can be predicted, saving on the costs of actually performing the experiment. This can have major impact in many settinsg. We study two example settings. First, in the field of pharmaceutical drug discovery early phase pharmaceutical experiments require casting a wide net to find a few potential leads to follow. In the long term, development pipelines can be re-designed to specifically utilize FMGAN in an optimal way to accelerate the process of drug discovery. FMGAN can also have a major impact in clinical setting, where routinely measured variables like blood pressure or heart rate can be used to predict important health outcomes and therefore deciding the best course of treatment.","NA",252,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.259598v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.259598v1.full.pdf

Variant B.1.1.7 lineage clade GR from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) was first detected in the UK, and it appears to possess an increased transmissibility. At the same time, South African authorities reported variant B.1.351, that shares several mutations with B.1.1.7, and might also present high transmissibility. Even more recently, a variant labeled P.1 with 17 non-synonymous mutations was detected in Brazil. In such a situation, it is paramount to rapidly develop specific molecular tests to uniquely identify, contain, and study new variants. Using a completely automated pipeline built around deep learning techniques, we design primer sets specific to variant B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1, respectively. Starting from sequences openly available in the GISAID repository, our pipeline was able to deliver the primer sets in just under 16 hours for each case study. In-silico tests show that the sequences in the primer sets present high accuracy and do not appear in samples from different viruses, nor in other coronaviruses or SARS-CoV-2 variants. The presented methodology can be exploited to swiftly obtain primer sets for each independent new variant, that can later be a part of a multiplexed approach for the initial diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, since our approach delivers primers able to differentiate between variants, it can be used as a second step of a diagnosis in cases already positive to COVID-19, to identify individuals carrying variants with potentially threatening features.",NA,180,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.20.427043v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.20.427043v1.full.pdf

Here, we perform site-directed mutagenesis to introduce the D614G variant and show that in multiple cell lines, including human lung epithelial cells, that the D614G mutation is up to 8-fold more effective at transducing cells than wild-type. We demonstrate increased infection using both Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus and intact SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although there is minimal difference in ACE2 receptor binding between the Spike variants, we show that the G614 variant is more resistant to proteolytic cleavage in vitro and in human cells, suggesting a possible mechanism for the increased transduction.

These proteases proteolytically activate the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and are key modulators of virus tropism. We show that SARS-CoV-2 naive serum exhibits significant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry. We identify alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) as the major serum protease inhibitor that potently restrict protease-mediated entry of SARS-CoV-2. AAT inhibition of protease-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry in vitro occurs at concentrations far below what is present in serum and bronchoalveolar tissues, suggesting that AAT effects are physiologically relevant. Moreover, AAT deficiency affects up to 20% of the population and its symptomatic manifestations coincides with many risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 disease. In addition to the effects that AAT may have on viral entry itself, we argue that the anti-inflammatory and coagulation regulatory activity of AAT have implications for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenicity, SARS-CoV-2 tissue restriction, convalescent plasma therapies, and even potentially AAT therapy.","NA",398,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.248880v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.248880v1.full.pdf

Countless lives have been claimed due to the existing pandemic and the societal normalcy has been damaged permanently. As a result, it becomes crucial for academic researchers in the field of bioinformatics to combat the existing pandemic. The study involved collecting the virulent strain sequence of SARS-nCoV19 for the country USA against human host through publically available bioinformatics databases. Using in-silica analysis and reverse vaccinology, two leader proteins were identified to be potential vaccine candidates for development of a multi-epitope drug. The results of this study can provide further researchers better aspects and direction on developing vaccine and immune responses against COVID19. This work also aims at promoting the use of existing bioinformatics tools to faster streamline the pipeline of vaccine development.

The Situation of COVID19A new infection respiratory disease was first observed in the month of December 2019, in Wuhan, situated in the Hubei province, China. Studies have indicated that the reason of this disease was the emergence of a genetically-novel coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV. This coronavirus, now named as nCoV-19, is the reason behind the spread of this fatal respiratory disease, now named as COVID-19. The initial group of infections is supposedly linked with the Huanan seafood market, most likely due to animal contact. Eventually, human-to-human interaction occurred and resulted in the transmission of the virus to humans. [13].

Since then, nCoV-19 has been rapidly spreading within China and other parts of World. At the time of writing this article (mid-March 2020), COVID-19 has spread across 146 countries. A count of 164,837 cases have been confirmed of being diagnosed with COVID-19, and a total of 6470 deaths have occurred. The cumulative cases have been depicting a rising trend and the numbers are just increasing. WHO has declared COVID-19 to be a ""global health emergency"". [14].

Current Scenario and ObjectivesCurrently, research is being conducted on a massive level to understand the immunology and genetic characteristics of the disease. However, no cure or vaccine of nCoV-19 has been developed at the time of writing this article.

Though, nCoV-19 and SARS-CoV are almost genetically similar, the respiratory syndrome caused by both of them, COVID-19 and SARS respectively, are completely different. Studies have indicated that -

""SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19"".

Besides the use of the prodrug remdesivir itself, the direct administration of GS-441 524, the resulting main metabolite of remdesivir, could be advantageous and even more effective. All substances were not originally developed for the treatment of COVID-19 and especially for GS-441 524 little is known about its pharmacokinetic and physical-chemical properties. To justify the application of new or repurposed drugs in humans, pre-clinical in vivo animal models are mandatory to investigate relevant PK and PD properties and their relationship to each other. In this study, an adapted mouse model was chosen to demonstrate its suitability to provide sufficient information on the model substances GS-441 524 and HCQ regarding plasma concentration and distribution into relevant tissues a prerequisite for treatment effectiveness.

MethodsGS-441 524 and HCQ were administered intravenously as a single injection to male mice. Blood and organ samples were taken at several time points and drug concentrations were quantified in plasma and tissue homogenates by two liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry methods. In vitro experiments were conducted to investigate the degradation of remdesivir in human plasma and blood. All pharmacokinetic analyses were performed with R Studio using non-compartmental analysis.

ResultsHigh tissue to plasma ratios for GS-441 524 and HCQ were found, indicating a significant distribution into the examined tissue, except for the central nervous system and fat. For GS-441 524, measured tissue concentrations exceeded the reported in vitro EC50 values by more than 10-fold and in consideration of its high efficacy against feline infectious peritonitis, GS-441 524 could indeed be effective against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. For HCQ, relatively high in vitro EC50 values are reported, which were not reached in all tissues. Facing its slow tissue distribution, HCQ might not lead to sufficient tissue saturation for a reliable antiviral effect.

ConclusionThe mouse model was able to characterise the PK and tissue distribution of both model substances and is a suitable tool to investigate early drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we could demonstrate a high tissue distribution of GS-441 524 even if not administered as the prodrug remdesivir.","NA",59,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.16.299537v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.16.299537v3.full.pdf

Here we present quantitative assay systems covering not only particle-cell and cell-cell fusion, but also demonstrating fusion-from-without (FFWO), the formation of syncytia induced by S-containing viral particles in absence of newly synthesized S protein. Based on complementation of split {beta}-galactosidase and virus-like-particles (VLPs) displaying S protein, this assay can be performed at BSL-1. All three assays provided readouts with a high dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratios covering several orders of magnitude. The data obtained confirm the enhancing effect of trypsin and overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on membrane fusion. Neutralizing antibodies as well as sera from convalescent patients inhibited particle-cell fusion with high efficiency. Cell-cell fusion, in contrast, was only moderately inhibited despite requiring much lower levels of S protein, which were below the detection limit of flow cytometry and Western blot. The data indicate that syncytia formation as a pathological consequence in tissues of Covid-19 patients can proceed at low levels of S protein and may not be effectively prevented by antibodies.","NA",303,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.340604v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.340604v1.full.pdf

However, little is known about temporal aspects of SARS-CoV-2 intrahost diversity and the extent to which shared diversity reflects convergent evolution as opposed to transmission linkage. Here we use high depth of coverage sequencing to identify within-host genetic variants in 325 specimens from hospitalized COVID-19 patients and infected employees at a single medical center. We validated our variant calling by sequencing defined RNA mixtures and identified a viral load threshold that minimizes false positives. By leveraging clinical metadata, we found that intrahost diversity is low and does not vary by time from symptom onset. This suggests that variants will only rarely rise to appreciable frequency prior to transmission. Although there was generally little shared variation across the sequenced cohort, we identified intrahost variants shared across individuals who were unlikely to be related by transmission. These variants did not precede a rise in frequency in global consensus genomes, suggesting that intrahost variants may have limited utility for predicting future lineages.

Wells,"University of California, San Francisco",2020-05-21,1,cc_by_nc_nd,Biochemistry,"A serious public health crisis is currently unfolding due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 viral entry depends on an interaction between the receptor binding domain of the trimeric viral Spike protein (Spike-RBD) and the dimeric human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. While it is clear that strategies to block the Spike/ACE2 interaction are promising as anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics, our current understanding is insufficient for the rational design of maximally effective therapeutic molecules. Here, we investigated the mechanism of Spike/ACE2 interaction by characterizing the binding affinity and kinetics of different multimeric forms of recombinant ACE2 and Spike-RBD domain. We also engineered ACE2 into a split Nanoluciferase-based reporter system to probe the conformational landscape of Spike-RBDs in the context of the Spike trimer. Interestingly, a dimeric form of ACE2, but not monomeric ACE2, binds with high affinity to Spike and blocks viral entry in pseudotyped virus and live SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization assays. We show that dimeric ACE2 interacts with an RBD on Spike with limited intra-Spike avidity, which nonetheless contributes to the affinity of this interaction. Additionally, we demonstrate that a proportion of Spike can simultaneously interact with multiple ACE2 dimers, indicating that more than one RBD domain in a Spike trimer can adopt an ACE2-accessible ""up"" conformation. Our findings have significant implications on the design strategies of therapeutic molecules that block the Spike/ACE2 interaction.

The duration of scholarly journals’ publication process is one of the main factors hindering quick delivery of new information. While proper editorial assessment and peer review obviously require some time, turnaround times for medical journals can be up to several months, which is undesirable in the era of a crisis. Following initiatives of medical journals and scholarly publishers to accelerate their publication process, this study assesses whether medical journals have indeed managed to speed up their publication process for Covid-19 related articles. It studies the duration of 14 medical journals’ publication process both during and prior to the current pandemic. Assessing a total of 669 articles, the study concludes that medical journals have indeed drastically accelerated the publication process for Covid-19 related articles since the outbreak of the pandemic. Compared to articles published in the same journals before the pandemic, turnaround times have decreased on average by 49%. The largest decrease in number of days between submission and publication of articles was due to a decrease in the number of days required for peer review. For articles not related to Covid-19, no acceleration of the publication process is found. While the acceleration of journals’ publication process is laudable from the perspective of quick information dissemination, it also raises concerns relating to the quality of the peer review process and the quality of the resulting publications.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",10.1162/qss_a_00076,375,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.18.045963v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.18.045963v1.full.pdf

However, understanding the evolutionary aspects of the biological components involved in the complex drug-nuclear import helps in understanding how these relationships exist in the deactivation of viral infections. Thus, 153 sequences of the HIV-1 integrase gene were analyzed for their genetic structure and molecular diversity and the presence of two distinct groups for the Gene and not only one, was detected; As well as different degrees of structuring for each of these groups. These results support the interpretation of the lack of conservation of the HIV-1 gene and that the number of existing polymorphisms, only for this structure of the complex, implies the non-efficiency of a drug at population levels.

Type I and III interferons (IFN-/{beta} and IFN-{lambda}) are host-produced antiviral cytokines and currently considered as COVID-19 therapy. Prolonged IFN-/{beta} responses can lead to harmful proinflammatory effects, whereas IFN-{lambda} mainly signals in epithelia, inducing localised antiviral immunity. Here we show that IFN signalling interferes with lung repair during influenza recovery, with IFN-{lambda} driving these effects most potently. IFN-induced p53 directly reduces epithelial proliferation and differentiation, increasing disease severity and susceptibility to bacterial superinfections. Hence, excessive or prolonged IFN-production aggravates viral infection by impairing lung epithelial regeneration.

We investigated the protein and mRNA expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and proteinase TMPRSS2 in lungs from COPD patients and controls, and lung tissue from mice exposed acutely and chronically to CS. Also, we investigated the effects of CS exposure on SARS-CoV-2 infection in human bronchial epithelial cells.

MethodsIn Cohort 1, ACE2-positive cells were quantified by immunostaining in FFPE sections from both central and peripheral airways. In Cohort 2, we quantified pulmonary ACE2 protein levels by immunostaining and ELISA, and both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels by RT-qPCR. In C57BL/6 WT mice exposed to air or CS for up to 6 months, pulmonary ACE2 protein levels were quantified by triple immunofluorescence staining and ELISA. The effects of CS exposure on SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated after 72hr in vitro infection of Calu-3 cells. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cells were fixed for IF staining with dsRNA-specific J2 monoclonal Ab, and cell lysates were harvested for WB of viral nucleocapsid (N) protein. Supernatants (SN) and cytoplasmic lysates were obtained to measure ACE2 levels by ELISA.

ResultsIn both human cohorts, ACE2 protein and mRNA levels were decreased in peripheral airways from COPD patients versus both smoker and NS controls, but similar in central airways. TMPRSS2 levels were similar across groups. Mice exposed to CS had decreased ACE2 protein levels in their bronchial and alveolar epithelia versus air-exposed mice exposed to 3 and 6 months of CS. In Calu3 cells in vitro, CS-treatment abrogated infection to levels below the limit of detection. Similar results were seen with WB for viral N protein, showing peak viral protein synthesis at 72hr.

ConclusionsACE2 levels were decreased in both bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells from uninfected COPD patients versus controls, and from CS-exposed versus air-exposed mice. CS-pre-treatment did not affect ACE2 levels but potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in this in vitro model. These findings urge to further investigate the controversial effects of CS and COPD on SARS-CoV2 infection.","NA",305,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.07.413252v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.07.413252v1.full.pdf

Utilizing our recently developed NanoBiT technology-based biosensor, we selectively identify and characterize the impact of mutating certain amino acid residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and in ACE2. Specifically, we examine the mutational effects on RBD-ACE2 binding ability, before and after the addition of competitive inhibitors, as well as neutralizing antibody activity.

J.",Geoffrey J Barton,University of Dundee,2020-05-04,1,cc_by,Genetics,"SARS-CoV-2 invades host cells via an endocytic pathway that begins with the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (S-protein) and human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Genetic variability in ACE2 may be one factor that mediates the broad-spectrum severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcomes. We investigated the capacity of ACE2 variation to influence SARS-CoV-2 infection with a focus on predicting the effect of missense variants on the ACE2 SARS-CoV-2 S-protein interaction. We validated the mCSM-PPI2 variant effect prediction algorithm with 26 published ACE2 mutant SARS-CoV S-protein binding assays and found it performed well in this closely related system (True Positive Rate = 0.7, True Negative Rate = 1). Application of mCSM-PPI2 to ACE2 missense variants from the Genome Aggregation Consortium Database (gnomAD) identified three that are predicted to strongly inhibit or abolish the S-protein ACE2 interaction altogether (p.Glu37Lys, p.Gly352Val and p.Asp355Asn) and one that is predicted to promote the interaction (p.Gly326Glu). The S-protein ACE2 inhibitory variants are expected to confer a high degree of resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection whilst the S-protein ACE2 affinity enhancing variant may lead to additional susceptibility and severity. We also performed in silico saturation mutagenesis of the S-protein ACE2 interface and identified a further 38 potential missense mutations that could strongly inhibit binding and one more that is likely to enhance binding (Thr27Arg). A conservative estimate places the prevalence of the strongly protective variants between 12-70 per 100,000 population but there is the possibility of higher prevalence in local populations or those underrepresented in gnomAD. The probable interplay between these ACE2 affinity variants and ACE2 expression polymorphisms is highlighted as well as gender differences in penetrance arising from ACE2s situation on the X-chromosome. It is also described how our data can help power future genetic association studies of COVID-19 phenotypes and how the saturation mutant predictions can help design a mutant ACE2 with tailored S-protein affinity, which may be an improvement over a current recombinant ACE2 that is undergoing clinical trial.

The reliability of the information extracted from the genotyping efforts depends on a number of aspects, including the quality of the input material, applied technology and potential laboratory-specific biases. These variables must be monitored to ensure genotype reliability. The current lack of guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 genotyping leads to inclusion of error-containing genome sequences in studies of viral spread and evolution.

ResultsWe used clinical samples and synthetic viral genomes to evaluate the impact of experimental factors, including viral load and sequencing depth, on correct sequence determination using an amplicon-based approach. We found that at least 1000 viral genomes are necessary to confidently detect variants in the genome at frequencies of 10% or higher. The broad applicability of our recommendations was validated in >200 clinical samples from six independent laboratories. The genotypes of clinical isolates with viral load above the recommended threshold cluster by sampling location and period. Our analysis also supports the rise in frequency of 20A.EU1 and 20A.EU2, two recently reported European strains whose dissemination was favoured by travelling during the summer 2020.

F.; Jagota, A.",Anand Jagota,Lehigh University,2020-06-26,1,cc_by_nc_nd,Bioengineering,"A critical event during the process of cell infection by a viral particle is attachment, which is driven by adhesive interactions and resisted by bending and tension. The biophysics of this process has been studied extensively but the additional role of externally applied force or displacement has generally been neglected. In this work we study the adhesive force-displacement response of viral particles against a cell membrane. We have built two models: one in which the viral particle is cylindrical (say, representative of filamentous virus such as Ebola) and another in which it is spherical (such as SARS-CoV-2 and Zika). Our interest is in initial adhesion, in which case deformations are small and the mathematical model for the system can be simplified considerably. The parameters that characterize the process combine into two dimensionless groups that represent normalized membrane bending stiffness and tension. In the limit where bending dominates, for sufficiently large values of normalized bending stiffness, there is no adhesion between viral particles and the cell membrane without applied force. (The zero-external-force contact width and pull-off force are both zero.) For large values of normalized membrane tension, the adhesion between virus and cell membrane is weak but stable. (The contact width at zero external force has a small value.) Our results for pull-off force and zero force contact width help to quantify conditions that could aid the development of therapies based on denying the virus entry into the cell by blocking its initial adhesion.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",10.1007/s42558-020-00026-3,435,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.173567v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.173567v1.full.pdf

F.",X. Frank Zhang,Lehigh University,2020-07-31,1,cc_no,Biophysics,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to a devastating impact across the world. SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) is known to use receptor-binding domain (RBD) at viral surface spike (S) protein to interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expressed on many human cell types. The RBD-ACE2 interaction is a crucial step to mediate the host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies indicate that the ACE2 interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has higher affinity than its binding with the structurally identical S protein of SARS-CoV-1, the virus causing the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak. However, the biophysical mechanism behind such binding affinity difference is unclear. This study utilizes a combined single-molecule force spectroscopy and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation approach to quantify the specific interactions between CoV-2 or CoV-1 RBD and ACE2. Depending on the loading rates, the unbinding forces between CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 range from 70 to 110 pN, and are 30-50% higher than those of CoV-1 RBD and ACE2 under similar loading rates. SMD results indicate that CoV-2 RBD interacts with the N-linked glycan on Asn90 of ACE2. This interaction is mostly absent in the CoV-1 RBD-ACE2 complex. During the SMD simulations, the extra RBD-N-glycan interaction contributes to a greater force and prolonged interaction lifetime. The observation is confirmed by our experimental force spectroscopy study. After the removal of N-linked glycans on ACE2, its mechanical binding strength with CoV-2 RBD decreases to a similar level of the CoV-1 RBD-ACE2 interaction. Together, the study uncovers the mechanism behind the difference in ACE2 binding between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, and could aid in the development of new strategies to block SARS-CoV-2 entry.

We validate BCD on a simulated data as well as applied it to a mouse retina development dataset and a lung dataset.

We provide gene expression profiles of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in three human cell lines (H1299, Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells), using bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. Small RNA profiling showed strong expression of the immunity and inflammation-associated microRNA miRNA-155 upon infection with both viruses. SARS-CoV-2 elicited approximately two-fold higher stimulation of the interferon response compared to SARS-CoV in the permissive human epithelial cell line Calu-3, and induction of cytokines such as CXCL10 or IL6. Single cell RNA sequencing data showed that canonical interferon stimulated genes such as IFIT2 or OAS2 were broadly induced, whereas interferon beta (IFNB1) and lambda (IFNL1-4) were expressed only in a subset of infected cells. In addition, temporal resolution of transcriptional responses suggested interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) activities precede that of nuclear factor-{kappa}B (NF-{kappa}B).

Understanding and monitoring the genetic evolution of the virus, its geographical characteristics, and its stability are particularly important for controlling the spread of the disease and especially for the development of a universal vaccine covering all circulating strains. From this perspective, we analyzed 30,983 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 79 countries located in the six continents and collected from December 24, 2019, to May 13, 2020, according to the GISAID database. Our analysis revealed the presence of 3,206 variant sites, with a uniform distribution of mutation types in different geographic areas. Remarkably, a low frequency of recurrent mutations has been observed; only 169 mutations (5.27%) had a prevalence greater than 1% of genomes. Nevertheless, fourteen non-synonymous hotspot mutations (> 10%) have been identified at different locations along the viral genome; eight in ORF1ab polyprotein (in nsp2, nsp3, transmembrane domain, RdRp, helicase, exonuclease, and endoribonuclease), three in nucleocapsid protein and one in each of three proteins: spike, ORF3a, and ORF8. Moreover, 36 non-synonymous mutations were identified in the RBD of the spike protein with a low prevalence (<1%) across all genomes, of which only four could potentially enhance the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the human ACE2 receptor. These results along with mutational frequency dissimilarity and intra-genomic divergence of SARS-CoV-2 could indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 is not yet adapted to its host.

They also provide a unique opportunity to observe virus evolution in real time. Here, we evaluate two cohorts of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences to identify rapidly emerging variants within structured cis-regulatory elements of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Overall, twenty variants are present at a minor allele frequency of at least 0.5%. Several enhance the stability of Stem Loop 1 in the 5UTR, including a set of co-occurring variants that extend its length. One appears to modulate the stability of the frameshifting pseudoknot between ORF1a and ORF1b, and another perturbs a bi-stable molecular switch in the 3UTR. Finally, five variants destabilize structured elements within the 3UTR hypervariable region, including the S2M stem loop, raising questions as to the functional relevance of these structures in viral replication. Two of the most abundant variants appear to be caused by RNA editing, suggesting host-viral defense contributes to SARS-CoV-2 genome heterogeneity.

Stevens,University of Florida College of Medicine,2020-11-01,1,cc_no,Biochemistry,"COVID-19 outcomes reflect organ-specific interplay of SARS-CoV-2 and its receptor, ACE2, with TMPRSS2 and ADAM17. Confirmed active tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in epithelial cells of intestine and kidney proximal tubule, and in aging cardiomyocytes, capriciously manifests extra-pulmonary organ-related clinical symptoms in about half of COVID-19 patients, occurring by poorly understood mechanisms. We approached this knowledge gap by recognizing a clue that these three particular cell types share a common denominator kindred of uniquely expressing the SLC6A19 neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 protein (alternatively called NBB, B, B0) serving glutamine and tryptophan uptake. B0AT1 is a cellular trafficking chaperone partner of ACE2, shown by cryo-EM to form a thermodynamically-favored stabilized 2ACE2:2B0AT1 dimer-of-heterodimers. The gut is the bodys site of greatest magnitude expression depot of both ACE2 and B0AT1. This starkly contrasts with pulmonary pneumocyte expression of monomeric ACE2 with conspicuously undetectable B0AT1. We hypothesized that B0AT1 steers the organ-related interplay amongst ACE2, TMPRSS2, ADAM17, and SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The present study employed molecular docking modeling that indicated active site catalytic pocket residues of TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 each formed bonds [&le;] 2 A with monomer ACE2 specific residues within a span R652-D713 involved in cleaving sACE2 soluble ectodomain release. These bonds are consistent with competitive binding interactions of experimental anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug small molecules including Camostat and Nafamostat. Without B0AT1, ACE2 residues K657 and N699 dominated docking bonding with TMPRSS2 or ADAM17 active sites, with ACE2 R710 and R709 contributing electrostatic attractions, but notably ACE2 S708 never closer than 16-44 A. However, in the dimer-of-heterodimers arrangement all ACE2 neck region residues were limited to TMPRSS2 or ADAM17 approaches 35 A, with the interference directly attributed to the presence of a neighboring B0AT1 subunit complexed to the partnering ACE2 subunit of 2ACE2:2B0AT1; ADAM17 failed to dock by bumping its active site pocket oriented dysfunctionally outwardly facing 1800 away. Results were the same whether the dimer-of-heterodimers was in either the ""closed"" or ""open"" conformation, or whether or not SARS-CoV-2 RBD was complexed to ACE2. The results implicate B0AT1-and in particular the 2ACE2:2B0AT1 complex-as a maJor player in the landscape of COVID-19 pathophysiology engaging TMPRSS2 and ADAM17, consistent with experimental evidence in the literature and in clinical reports. These findings provide a gateway to understanding the roles of B0AT1 relating to COVID-19 manifestations putatively assigned to intestinal and renal epithelial cells and cardiomyocytes, with underpinnings useful for considerations in public hygiene policy and drug development.","NA",253,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.31.363473v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.31.363473v1.full.pdf

The use of common laboratory strains of mice to this end is hindered by significant divergence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the receptor required for entry of SARS-CoV-2. In the current study, we designed and utilized an mRNA-based transfection system to induce expression of the hACE2 receptor in order to confer entry of SARS-CoV-2 in otherwise non-permissive cells. By employing this expression system in an in vivo setting, we were able to interrogate the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in type 1 interferon receptor deficient mice. In doing so, we showed that the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 is enhanced when hACE2 is expressed during infection. Moreover, we demonstrated that these responses are preserved in memory and are boosted upon secondary infection.

SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to elevated markers of cardiac injury associated with higher risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. It is unclear whether cardiac injury may have been caused by direct infection of cardiomyocytes or is mainly secondary to lung injury and inflammation. Here we investigate whether human cardiomyocytes are permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsInfection was induced by two strains of SARS-CoV-2 (FFM1 and FFM2) in human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CM) and in two models of human cardiac tissue.

ResultsWe show that SARS-CoV-2 infects hiPS-CM as demonstrated by detection of intracellular double strand viral RNA and viral spike glycoprotein protein expression. Increasing concentrations of virus RNA are detected in supernatants of infected cardiomyocytes, which induced infections in CaCo-2 cell lines documenting productive infections. SARS-COV-2 infection induced cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects and abolished cardiomyocyte beating. RNA sequencing confirmed a transcriptional response to viral infection as demonstrated by the up-regulation of genes associated with pathways related to viral response and interferon signaling, apoptosis and reactive oxygen stress. SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiotoxicity was confirmed in a iPS-derived human 3D cardiosphere tissue models. Importantly, viral spike protein and viral particles were detected in living human heart slices after infection with SARS-CoV-2.

ConclusionsThe demonstration that cardiomyocytes are permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro warrants the further in depth monitoring of cardiotoxic effects in COVID-19 patients.

We also found that the SUD-like sequence is retained in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, while some other coronaviruses that can infect humans are depleted. Further analysis revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 SUD-like sequence is almost conserved among 16,466 SARS-CoV-2 samples. And the SARS-CoV-2 SUDcore-like dimer displayed similar electrostatic potential pattern to the SUD dimer. Considering the potential value of G-quadruplexes to serve as targets in antiviral strategy, we hope our fundamental research could provide new insights for the SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery.","NA",428,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.05.135749v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.05.135749v1.full.pdf

Reverse genetics systems for many CoVs have been established, but none exist for ToVs. Here, we describe a reverse genetics system using a full-length infectious cDNA clone of bovine ToV (BToV) in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Recombinant BToV containing genetic markers had the same phenotype as wild-type (wt) BToV. To generate two types of recombinant virus, the Hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene was manipulated, since cell-adapted wtBToV generally loses the full-length HE (HEf), resulting in soluble HE (HEs). First, recombinant viruses with HEf and HA-tagged HEf or HEs genes were rescued; these showed no significant differences in cell growth, suggesting that HE is not essential for viral growth in cells. Then, recombinant virus in which HE was replaced by the Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) gene expressed EGFP in infected cells, but showed significantly reduced viral growth compared to wtBToV. Moreover, the recombinant virus readily deleted the EGFP gene after one passage. Interestingly, one variant with mutations in non-structural proteins (NSPs) showed improved EGFP expression and viral growth during serial passages, although it eventually deleted the EGFP gene, suggesting that these mutations contributed to EGFP gene acceptance. These recombinant viruses provide new insights regarding BToV and its reverse genetics will help advance understanding of this neglected pathogen.

ImportanceToVs are diarrhea-causing pathogens that have been detected in many species, including humans. BToV has spread worldwide, leading to economic losses. We developed the first reverse genetics system for Tobaniviridae using a BAC-based BToV. Using this system, we showed that recombinant BToVs with HEf and HEs showed no significant differences in cell growth. In contrast, clinical BToVs generally lose the HE gene after a few passages but some recombinant viruses retained the HE gene for up to 20 passages, suggesting some benefits of HE retention. The EGFP gene of the recombinant viruses was unstable and was rapidly deleted, likely via negative selection. Interestingly, one virus variant with mutations in NSPs was more stable, resulting in improved EGFP-expression and viral growth, suggesting that the mutations contributed to some acceptance of the exogenous EGFP gene without clear positive selection. The recombinant BToVs and reverse genetics developed here are powerful tools for understanding fundamental viral processes and their pathogenesis and for developing BToV vaccines.","NA",457,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.28.358754v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.28.358754v1.full.pdf

We observe the emergence of a new category of preprint authors working in the fields of immunology, microbiology, infectious diseases, and epidemiology, who extensively used preprint platforms during the pandemic for sharing their immediate findings. The majority of these findings were works-in-progress unfitting for a prompt acceptance by refereed journals. The COVID-19 preprints that became peer-reviewed journal articles were often submitted to journals concurrently with the posting on a preprint server, and the entire publication cycle, from preprint to the online journal article, took on average 63 days. This included an expedited peer-review process of 43 days and journals production stage of 15 days, however there was a wide variation in publication delays between journals. Only one third of COVID-19 preprints posted during the first nine months of the pandemic appeared as peer-reviewed journal articles. These journal articles display high Altmetric Attention Scores further emphasizing a significance of COVID-19 research during 2020.

The accepted rule is that mismatches are detrimental as they reduce the hybridization temperatures, yet a more quantitative assessment is rarely performed.

MethodsWe calculate the hybridization temperatures of primer/probe sets after aligning to SARS-COV-2, SARS-COV-1 and non-SARS genomes, considering all possible combinations of single, double and triple consecutive mismatches. We consider the mismatched hybridization temperature within a range of 5 {degrees}C to the fully matched reference temperature.

ResultsWe obtained the alignments of 19 PCR primers sets that were recently reported for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and to 21665 SARS-CoV-2 genomes as well as 323 genomes of other viruses of the coronavirus family of which 10 are SARS-CoV-1. We find that many incompletely aligned primers become fully aligned to most of the SARS-CoV-2 when mismatches are considered. However, we also found that many cross-align to SARS-CoV-1 and non-SARS genomes.

ConclusionsSome primer/probe sets only align substantially to most SARS-CoV-2 genomes if mismatches are taken into account. Unfortunately, by the same mechanism, almost 75% of these sets also align to some SARS-CoV-1 and non-SARS viruses. It is therefore recommended to consider mismatch hybridization for the design of primers whenever possible, especially to avoid undesired cross-reactivity.",10.1016/j.mcp.2021.101707,317,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.368449v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.368449v1.full.pdf

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as an entry point into cells for some strains of coronavirus (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2). Our hypothesis was that as ACE2 is essential to the SARS-CoV-2 virus invasion, then brain regions where ACE2 is the most expressed are more likely to be disturbed by the infection. Thus, the expression of other genes which are also over-expressed in those damaged areas could be affected. We used mRNA expression levels data of genes provided by the Allen Human Brain Atlas (ABA), and computed spatial correlations with the LinkRbrain platform. Genes whose co-expression is spatially correlated to that of ACE2 were then clustered into 16 groups, depending on the organ in which they are the most expressed (as described by the NCBI genes database).

Here, using ribosome profiling in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, we identify structural elements that regulate viral gene expression, alternative translation initiation events, as well as host responses regulated by mRNA translation. We found that the ribosome density was low within the SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting element but high immediately downstream, which suggests the utilization of a highly efficient ribosomal frameshifting strategy. In SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, although many chemokine, cytokine and interferon stimulated genes were upregulated at the mRNA level, they were not translated efficiently, suggesting a translational block that disarms host innate host responses. Together, these data reveal the key role of mRNA translation in SARS-CoV-2 replication and highlight unique mechanisms for therapeutic development.

Cancer patients are more prone to clinically evolve to more severe COVID-19 conditions, but the determinants of such a more severe outcome remain largely unknown. We have determined the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences of cancer patients and healthcare workers (HCW; non-cancer controls) by deep sequencing and investigated the within-host viral quasispecies of each infection, quantifying intrahost genetic diversity. Naso- and oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2+ swabs from 57 cancer patients and 14 healthcare workers (HCW) from the Brazilian Cancer Institute were collected in April-May 2020. Complete genome amplification using ARTIC network V3 multiplex primers was performed followed by next-generation sequencing. Assemblies were conducted in Geneious R11, where consensus sequences were extracted and intrahost single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) were identified. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis was performed using PhyMLv.3.0 and lineages were classified using Pangolin and CoV-GLUE. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all but one strain belonged to clade B1.1. Four genetically linked mutations known as the globally dominant SARS-CoV-2 haplotype (C241T, C3037T, C14408T and A23403G) were found in the majority of consensus sequences. SNV signatures of previously characterized Brazilian genomes were also observed in most samples. Another 85 SNVs were found at a lower frequency (1.4-19.7%). Cancer patients displayed a significantly higher intrahost viral genetic diversity compared to HCW (p = 0.009). Intrahost genetic diversity in cancer patients was independent of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values, and was not associated with disease severity, use of corticosteroids, or use of antivirals, characteristics that could influence viral diversity. Such a feature may explain, at least in part, the more adverse outcomes to which cancer/COVID-19 patients experience.

Author SummaryCancer patients are more prone to clinically evolve to more severe COVID-19 conditions, but the determinants of such a more severe outcome remain largely unknown. In this study, phylogenetic and variation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from cancer patients and non-cancer healthcare workers at the Brazilian National Cancer Institute were characterized by deep sequencing. Viral genomes showed signatures characteristic of Brazilian viruses, consistent with the hypothesis of local, community transmission rather than virus importation from abroad. Despite most genomes in patients and healthcare workers belonging to the same lineage, intrahost variability was higher in cancer patients when compared to non-cancer counterparts. The intrahost genomic diversity analysis presented in our study highlights the relaxed evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a vulnerable population of cancer patients. The high number of minor variations can result in the selection of immune escape variants, resistance to potential drugs, and/or increased pathogenicity. The impact of this higher intrahost variability over time warrants further investigation.","NA",310,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.26.267831v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.26.267831v1.full.pdf

This cell line is being widely used to propagate the novel coronavirus. The viral transcriptome was analysed using a recently developed ORF-centric pipeline. This revealed the pattern of viral transcripts, (i.e. subgenomic mRNAs), generally fitted the predicted replication and transcription model for coronaviruses. A 24 nt in-frame deletion was detected in subgenomic mRNAs encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein. This feature was identified in over half of the mapped transcripts and was predicted to remove a proposed furin cleavage site from the S glycoprotein. This motif directs cleavage of the S glycoprotein into functional subunits during virus entry or exit. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein can be a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus transmission and affect viral pathogenicity. Allied to this transcriptome analysis, tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify over 500 viral peptides and 44 phosphopeptides, covering almost all of the proteins predicted to be encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including peptides unique to the deleted variant of the S glycoprotein. Detection of an apparently viable deletion in the furin cleavage site of the S glycoprotein reinforces the point that this and other regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins may readily mutate. This is of clear significance given the interest in the S glycoprotein as a potential vaccine target and the observation that the furin cleavage site likely contributes strongly to the pathogenesis and zoonosis of this virus. The viral genome sequence should be carefully monitored during the growth of viral stocks for research, animal challenge models and, potentially, in clinical samples.

This is especially important if the disease-causing agent has no effective treatment, such as the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (the pathogen causing COVID-19), and shows no or similar symptoms to other common infections. We report a silicon-based integrated Point-of-Need (PoN) transducer (TriSilix) that can chemically-amplify and detect pathogen-specific sequences of nucleic acids (NA) quantitatively in real-time. Unlike other silicon-based technologies, TriSilix can be produced at wafer-scale in a standard laboratory; we have developed a series of methodologies based on metal-assisted chemical (wet) etching, electroplating, thermal bonding and laser-cutting to enable a cleanroom-free low-cost fabrication that does not require processing in an advanced semiconductor foundry. TriSilix is, therefore, resilient to disruptions in the global supply chain as the devices can be produced anywhere in the world. To create an ultra-low-cost device, the architecture proposed exploits the intrinsic properties of silicon and integrates three modes of operation in a single chip: i) electrical (Joule) heater, ii) temperature sensor (i.e. thermistor) with a negative temperature coefficient that can provide the precise temperature of the sample solution during reaction and iii) electrochemical sensor for detecting target NA. Using TriSilix, the sample solution can be maintained at a single, specific temperature (needed for isothermal amplification of NA such as Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) or cycled between different temperatures (with a precision of {+/-}1.3{degrees}C) for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) while the exact concentration of amplicons is measured quantitatively and in real-time electrochemically. A single 4-inch Si wafer yields 37 TriSilix chips of 10x10x0.65 mm in size and can be produced in 7 hours, costing ~US $0.35 per device. The system is operated digitally, portable and low power - capable of running up to 35 tests with a 4000 mAh battery (a typical battery capacity of a modern smartphone). We were able to quantitatively detect a 563-bp fragment (Insertion Sequence IS900) of the genomic DNA of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (extracted from cultured field samples) through PCR in real-time with a Limit-of-Detection of 20 fg, equivalent to a single bacterium, at the 30th cycle.

Spike trafficking to lysosomes is an endocytosis-independent, V-ATPase-dependent process, and spike-containing lysosomes drive lysosome clustering but display poor lysotracker labeling and reduced uptake of endocytosed materials.

Applied to single-cell data, such analyses can provide mechanistic insights into individual cells and their interactions. However, knowledge of intercellular communication is scarce, scattered across different resources, and not linked to intracellular processes. To address this gap, we combined over 100 resources in a single database. It covers the interactions and roles of proteins in inter- and intracellular signal transduction, as well as transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. We also provide a comprehensive collection of protein complexes and rich annotations on the properties of proteins, including function, localization, and role in diseases. The resource is available for human, and via homology translation for mouse and rat. The data is accessible via OmniPaths web service, a Cytoscape plugin, and packages in R/Bioconductor and Python, providing convenient access options for both computational and experimental scientists. Our resource provides a single access point to knowledge spanning intra- and intercellular processes for data analysis, as we demonstrate in applications to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and ulcerative colitis.

RBD obtained from both yeast and mammalian cells was properly folded, as indicated by UV-absorption, circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence. They also had similar stability, as indicated by temperature-induced unfolding (observed Tm were 50 {degrees}C and 52 {degrees}C for RBD produced in P. pastoris and HEK-293T cells, respectively). Moreover, the stability of both variants was similarly reduced when the ionic strength was increased, in agreement with a computational analysis predicting that a set of ionic interactions may stabilize RBD structure. Further characterization by HPLC, size-exclusion chromatography and mass spectrometry revealed a higher heterogeneity of RBD expressed in P. pastoris relative to that produced in HEK-293T cells, which disappeared after enzymatic removal of glycans. The production of RBD in P. pastoris was scaled-up in a bioreactor, with yields above 45 mg/L of 90% pure protein, thus potentially allowing large scale immunizations to produce neutralizing antibodies, as well as the large scale production of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2.","NA",307,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.17.300335v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.17.300335v1.full.pdf

M.; Saffarian, S.; Vershinin, M.",Saveez Saffarian,University of Utah,2020-10-14,1,cc_no,Biophysics,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus which has caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Other known coronaviruses show a strong pattern of seasonality, with the infection cases in humans being more prominent in winter. Although several plausible origins of such seasonal variability have been proposed, its mechanism is unclear. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via airborne droplets ejected from the upper respiratory tract of the infected individuals. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious for hours on surfaces. As such, the stability of viral particles both in liquid droplets as well as dried on surfaces is essential for infectivity. Here we have used atomic force microscopy to examine the structural stability of individual SARS-CoV-2 virus like particles at different temperatures. We demonstrate that even a mild temperature increase, commensurate with what is common for summer warming, leads to dramatic disruption of viral structural stability, especially when the heat is applied in the dry state. This is consistent with other existing non-mechanistic studies of viral infectivity, provides a single particle perspective on viral seasonality, and strengthens the case for a resurgence of COVID-19 in winter.

Statement of Scientific SignificanceThe economic and public health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are very significant. However scientific information needed to underpin policy decisions are limited partly due to novelty of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. There is therefore an urgent need for mechanistic studies of both COVID-19 disease and the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We show that individual virus particles suffer structural destabilization at relatively mild but elevated temperatures. Our nanoscale results are consistent with recent observations at larger scales.

Our analysis of the structural variability of the TMPRSS2 gene based on genome-wide data of 76 human populations demonstrates that functionally significant missense mutation in exon 6/7 in TMPRSS2 gene, was found in many human populations in relatively high frequency, featuring region-specific distribution patterns. The frequency of the missense mutation encoded by the rs12329760, which previously was found to be associated with prostate cancer, is ranged between 10% and 63% being significantly higher in populations of Asian origin compared to European populations.

A better understanding of the pathophysiology associated with COVID-19 is crucial to improve treatment modalities and to develop effective prevention strategies. Transcriptomic and proteomic data on the host response against SARS-CoV-2 still have anecdotic character; currently available data from other coronavirus infections are therefore a key source of information.

MethodsWe investigated selected molecular aspects of three human coronavirus (HCoV) infections, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, through a network based-approach. A functional analysis of HCoV-host interactome was carried out in order to provide a theoretic host-pathogen interaction model for HCoV infections and in order to translate the results in prediction for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

The 3D model of S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was compared to the structure of the corresponding SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV S-glycoprotein. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E and the host interactome were inferred through published protein-protein interactions (PPI) as well as gene co-expression, triggered by HCoV S-glycoprotein in host cells.

ResultsAlthough the amino acid sequences of the S-glycoprotein were found to be different between the various HCoV, the structures showed high similarity, but the best 3D structural overlap shared by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, consistent with the shared ACE2 predicted receptor. The host interactome, linked to the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, mainly highlighted innate immunity pathway components, such as Toll Like receptors, cytokines and chemokines.

We provide a network analysis on protein-protein interactions (PPI) between viral and host proteins to better identify host biological responses, induced by both whole proteome of SARS-CoV-2 and specific viral proteins. A host-virus interactome was inferred on published PPI, using an explorative algorithm (Random Walk with Restart) triggered by all the 28 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, or each single viral protein one-by-one. The functional analysis for all proteins, linked to many aspects of COVID-19 pathogenesis, allows to identify the subcellular districts, where SARS-CoV-2 proteins seem to be distributed, while in each interactome built around one single viral protein, a different response was described, underlining as ORF8 and ORF3a modulated cardiovascular diseases and pro-inflammatory pathways, respectively. Finally, an explorative network-based approach was applied to Bradykinin Storm, highlighting a possible direct action of ORF3a and NS7b to enhancing this condition.

We report X-ray crystal structures of four Fab variants bound to the RBD and use the structures to explain the basis for changes in RBD affinity. We show that a germline revertant antibody binds tightly to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralizes virus, and that gains in affinity for the RBD do not necessarily correlate with increased neutralization potency, suggesting that somatic mutation is not required to exert robust antiviral effect.

Here we present the 2.9 [A] resolution cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 in complex with B0AT1. The complex, assembled as a dimer of ACE2-B0AT1 heterodimers, exhibits open and closed conformations due to the shifts of the peptidase domains (PDs) of ACE2. A newly resolved Collectrin-like domain (CLD) on ACE2 mediates homo-dimerization. Structural modelling suggests that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins simultaneously, providing important clues to the molecular basis for coronavirus recognition and infection.","NA",192,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.951848v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.951848v1.full.pdf

Therapeutic agents, including dexamethasone, are mostly transported through the body by binding to serum albumin. Herein, we report the first structure of serum albumin in complex with dexamethasone. We show that it binds to Drug Site 7, which is also the binding site for commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and testosterone, suggesting potentially problematic binding competition. This study bridges structural findings with our analysis of publicly available clinical data from Wuhan and suggests that an adjustment of dexamethasone regimen should be considered for patients affected by two major COVID-19 risk-factors: low albumin levels and diabetes.

Because many individuals shed virus for days before symptom onset, and many show mild or no symptoms, an emergent and unprecedented need exists for development and deployment of sensitive and high throughput molecular diagnostic tests. RNA-mediated oligonucleotide Annealing Selection and Ligation with next generation DNA sequencing (RASL-seq) is a highly multiplexed technology for targeted analysis of polyadenylated mRNA, which incorporates sample barcoding for massively parallel analyses. Here we present a more generalized method, capture RASL-seq (“cRASL-seq”), which enables analysis of any targeted pathogen-(and/or host-) associated RNA molecules. cRASL-seq enables highly sensitive (down to ∼1-100 pfu/ml or cfu/ml) and highly multiplexed (up to ∼10,000 target sequences) detection of pathogens. Importantly, cRASL-seq analysis of COVID-19 patient nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens does not involve nucleic acid extraction or reverse transcription, steps that have caused testing bottlenecks associated with other assays. Our simplified workflow additionally enables the direct and efficient genotyping of selected, informative SARS-CoV-2 polymorphisms across the entire genome, which can be used for enhanced characterization of transmission chains at population scale and detection of viral clades with higher or lower virulence. Given its extremely low per-sample cost, simple and automatable protocol and analytics, probe panel modularity, and massive scalability, we propose that cRASL-seq testing is a powerful new surveillance technology with the potential to help mitigate the current pandemic and prevent similar public health crises.Competing Interest StatementJ.J.C. and H.B.L. are listed as inventors on a patent describing the cRASL-seq method.

The closely related polysaccharide heparin, the widely used anticoagulant drug, which is structurally similar to HS and is a common experimental proxy, can be expected to mimic the properties of HS. Heparin prevents infection by a range of viruses when added exogenously, including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1 and inhibits cellular invasion by SARS-CoV-2. We have previously demonstrated that unfractionated heparin binds to the Spike (S1) protein receptor binding domain, induces a conformational change and have reported the structural features of heparin on which this interaction depends. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that enoxaparin, a low molecular weight clinical anticoagulant, also binds the S1 RBD protein and induces conformational change. Here we expand upon these studies, to a wide range of low molecular weight heparins and demonstrate that they induce a variety of conformational changes in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. These findings may have further implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing low molecular weight heparins, as well as for next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antiviral agents, against SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the Coronaviridae.","NA",510,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.068486v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.068486v1.full.pdf

M.; Crinion, S.",Khalid M Bindayna,Arabian Gulf University,2020-10-09,1,cc_no,Microbiology,"BackgroundCoronavirus (COVID-19) was introduced into society in late 2019 and has now reached over 26 million cases and 850,000 deaths. The Middle East has a death toll of [~]50,000 and over 20,000 of these are in Iran, which has over 350,000 confirmed cases. We expect that Iranian cases caused outbreaks in the neighbouring countries and that variant mapping and phylogenetic analysis can be used to prove this. We also aim to analyse the variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to characterise the common genome variants and provide useful data in the global effort to prevent further spread of COVID-19.

MethodsThe approach uses bioinformatics approaches including multiple sequence alignment, variant calling and annotation and phylogenetic analysis to identify the genomic variants found in the region. The approach uses 122 samples from the 13 countries of the Middle East sourced from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID).

FindingsWe identified 2200 distinct genome variants including 129 downstream gene variants, 298 frame shift variants, 789 missense variants, 1 start lost, 13 start gained, 1 stop lost, 249 synonymous variants and 720 upstream gene variants. The most common, high impact variants were 10818delTinsG, 2772delCinsC, 14159delCinsC and 2789delAinsA. Variant alignment and phylogenetic tree generation indicates that samples from Iran likely introduced COVID-19 to the rest of the Middle East.

InterpretationThe phylogenetic and variant analysis provides unique insight into mutation types in genomes. Initial introduction of COVID-19 was most likely due to Iranian transmission. Some countries show evidence of novel mutations and unique strains. Increased time in small populations is likely to contribute to more unique genomes. This study provides more in depth analysis of the variants affecting in the region than any other study.

Here we report new insights into the molecular basis of the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and the human ACE2 receptor. We further observed that glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor enhances SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Importantly estrogens can disrupt glycan-glycan interactions and glycan-protein interactions between the human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV2 thereby blocking its entry into cells. In a mouse model, estrogens reduced ACE2 glycosylation and thereby alveolar uptake of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

In June 2020, all African countries registered human infections with SARS-CoV-2.

The virus is mutating steadily and this is monitored by a well curated database of viral nucleotide sequences from samples taken from infected individual thus enabling phylogenetic analysis and phenotypic associations.

MethodsWe downloaded from the GISAID database, SARS-CoV-2 sequences established from four West African countries Ghana, Gambia, Senegal and Nigeria and then performed phylogenetic analysis employing the nextstrain pipeline. Based on mutations found within the sequences we calculated and visualized statistics characterizing clades according to the GISAID nomenclature.

ResultsWe found country-specific patterns of viral clades: the later Europe-associated G-clades predominantly in Senegal and Gambia, and combinations of the earlier (L, S, V) and later clades in Ghana and Nigeria. Contrary to our expectations, the later Europe-associated G-clades emerged before the earlier clades. Detailed analysis of distinct samples showed that some of the earlier clades might have circulated latently and some reflect migration routes via Mali and Tunisia.

ConclusionsThe distinct patterns of viral clades in the West African countries point at its emergence from Europe and China via Asia and Europe. The observation that the later clades emerged before the earlier clades could be simply due to founder effects or due to latent circulation of the earlier clades. Only a marginal correlation of the G-clades associated with the D614G mutation could be identified with the relatively low case fatality (0.6-3.2).

However, there is limited published data associating the results from commercial assays with neutralizing antibodies.Methods 67 specimens from 48 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and a positive result by the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, or EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and 5 control specimens were analyzed for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Correlation, concordance, positive percent agreement (PPA), and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated at several cutoffs. Results were compared in patients categorized by clinical outcomes.Results The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer (EC50) and the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays was 0.29, 0.47, and 0.46 respectively. At an EC50 of 1:32, the concordance kappa with Roche was 0.49 (95% CI; 0.23-0.75), with Abbott was 0.52 (0.28-0.77), and with EUROIMMUN was 0.61 (0.4-0.82). At the same neutralizing titer, the PPA and NPA for the Roche was 100% (94-100) &amp; 56% (30-80); Abbott was 96% (88-99) &amp; 69% (44-86); and EUROIMMUN was 91% (80-96) &amp; 81% (57-93) for distinguishing neutralizing antibodies. Patients who died, were intubated, or had a cardiac injury from COVID-19 infection had significantly higher neutralizing titers relative to those with mild symptoms.Conclusion COVID-19 patients generate an antibody response to multiple viral proteins such that the calibrator ratios on the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays are all associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.

Their tropism is primarily determined by the ability of the spike (S) protein to bind to a host cell surface receptor. The rapid outbreak of emerging novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV 2 in China inculcates the need for the development of hasty and effective intervention strategies. Medicinal plants and natural compounds have been traditionally used to treat viral infections. Here, we generated VSV based pseudotyped viruses (pvs) of SARS-, MERS-, and SARS-2 CoVs to screen entry inhibitors from natural products. In the first series of experiments, we demonstrated that pseudotyped viruses specifically bind on their receptors and enter into the cells. SARS and MERS polyclonal antibodies neutralize SARSpv and SARS-2pv, and MERSpv respectively. Incubation of soluble ACE2 inhibited entry of SARS and SARS-2 pvs but not MERSpv. In addition, expression of ACE2 and DPP4 in non-permissive BHK21 cells enabled infection by SARSpv, SARS-2pv, and MERSpv respectively. Next, we showed the antiviral properties of known enveloped virus entry inhibitors, Spirulina and Green tea extracts against CoVpvs. SARSpv, MERSpv, and SARS-2pv entry were blocked with higher efficiency when preincubated with either green tea or spirulina extracts. Green tea provided a better inhibitory effect than the spirulina extracts by binding to the S1 domain of spike and blocking the interaction of spike with its receptor. Further studies are required to understand the exact mechanism of viral inhibition. In summary, we demonstrate that pseudotyped virus is an ideal tool for screening viral entry inhibitors. Moreover, spirulina and green tea could be promising antiviral agents against emerging viruses.","NA",350,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.162701v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.162701v1.full.pdf

From previously published evidence, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, are both pivotal entry molecules that enable cellular infection by SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, or a ""cytokine storm,"" is associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome that is often observed in critically ill patients.

MethodsWe investigated the expression pattern of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in major organs in the human body, especially under specific disease conditions. Multiple sequence alignment of ACE2 in different species was used to explain animal susceptibility. Moreover, the cell-specific expression patterns of ACE2 and cytokine receptors in the urinary tract were assessed using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Additional biological relevance was determined through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using an ACE2 specific signature.

ResultsOur results revealed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly expressed in genitourinary organs. ACE2 was highly and significantly expressed in the kidney among individuals with chronic kidney diseases or diabetic nephropathy. In single cells, ACE2 was primarily enriched in gametocytes in the testis, and renal proximal tubules. The receptors for pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL6ST, were remarkably concentrated in endothelial cells, macrophages, and spermatogonial stem cells in the testis, and renal endothelial cells, which suggested the occurrence of alternative damaging mechanisms via autoimmune attacks.

ConclusionsThis study provided new insights into the pathogenicity mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 that underlie the clinical manifestations observed in the human testis and kidney. These observations might substantially facilitate the development of effective treatments for this rapidly spreading disease.",10.2147/IDR.S270543,430,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.08.083618v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.08.083618v1.full.pdf

We selected a biologically relevant pre-clinical experimental model of SARS-CoV-2 lung infection using a 3D human reconstituted airway epithelial model of nasal origin to characterize the effects of nafamostat on tissue-level cellular ultrastructure and viral infection kinetics. Our results confirm the not only the relevance of this model for the preclinical evaluation of safety and efficacy of antiviral candidates, but also the highly potent nature of nafamostat SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity.

There is an urgent need to develop curative and preventive therapeutics to limit the current pandemic and to prevent the re-emergence of Covid-19. This study aimed to assess the in vitro activity of copper gluconate against SRAS-CoV-2.

MethodsVero E6 cells were treated with copper gluconate 18 hours before infection. Cells were infected with a recombinant GFP expressing SARS-CoV-2. Infected cells were maintained in fresh medium containing copper gluconate for an additional 48-hour period. The infection level was measured by the confocal microscopy-based high content screening method. The cell viability in presence of copper gluconate was assessed by XTT assay.

ResultsThe viability of Vero E6 cells treated with copper gluconate up to 200 M was found to be similar to that of untreated cells, but it dropped below 40% with 400 M of this agent. The infection rate was 23.8%, 18.9%, 20.6%, 6.9%, 5.3%,5.2% in cells treated with 0, 2, 10, 25, 50 and 100 M of copper gluconate respectively. As compared to untreated cells, the number of infected cells was reduced by 71%, 77%, and 78% with 25, 50, and 100 M of copper gluconate respectively (p < 0.05).

ConclusionCopper gluconate was found to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells. Furthers studies are needed to determine whether copper homeostasis could play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Chinese authorities later identified a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the causative agent of the outbreak. As of January 23, 2020, 655 cases have been confirmed in China and several other countries. Understanding the transmission characteristics and the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is critically important for coordinating current screening and containment strategies, and determining whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). We performed stochastic simulations of early outbreak trajectories that are consistent with the epidemiological findings to date. We found the basic reproduction number, R0, to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval 1.4--3.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of a similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the 1918 pandemic influenza. These findings underline the importance of heightened screening, surveillance and control efforts, particularly at airports and other travel hubs, in order to prevent further international spread of 2019-nCoV.","NA",355,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.917351v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.917351v1.full.pdf

L.",David L Robertson,University of Glasgow,2020-12-30,1,cc_by_nc,Bioinformatics,"The clinical outcome of COVID-19 has an extreme age, genetic and comorbidity bias that is thought to be driven by an impaired immune response to SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the disease. The unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on global health has resulted in multiple studies generating a variety of large gene expression datasets in a relatively short period of time. In order to better understand the immune dysregulation induced by SARS-CoV-2, we carried out a meta-analysis of these transcriptomics data available in the published literature. Datasets included both those available from SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines in vitro and those from patient samples. We focused our analysis on the identification of viral perturbed host functions as captured by co-expressed gene module analysis. Transcriptomics data from lung biopsies and nasopharyngeal samples, as opposed to those available from other clinical samples and infected cell lines, provided key signatures on the role of the hosts immune response on COVID-19 pathogenesis. For example, severity of infection and patients age are linked to the absence of stimulation of the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, a known critical immediate line of defense against RNA viral infections that triggers type-I interferon responses. In addition, co-expression analysis of age-stratified transcriptional data provided evidence that signatures of key immune response pathways are perturbed in older COVID-19 patients. In particular, dysregulation of antigen-presenting components, down-regulation of cell cycle mechanisms and signatures of hyper-enriched monocytes were strongly correlated with the age of older individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, our meta-analysis highlights the ability of transcriptomics and gene-module analysis of aggregated datasets to aid our improved understanding of the host-specific disease mechanisms underpinning COVID-19.",NA,175,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.29.424739v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.29.424739v1.full.pdf

This study compared three of these assays: the Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay (Fusion), the Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay (Aptima) and the BioFire Diagnostics COVID-19 test (BioFire), to determine analytical and clinical performance, as well as workflow. All three assays showed a similar limit of detection (LOD) using inactivated virus, with 100% detection ranging from 500-1,000 genome equivalents/ml, whereas use of a quantified RNA transcript standard showed the same trend, but had values ranging from 62.5 to 125 copies/ml, confirming variability in absolute quantification of reference standards. The clinical correlation found that the Fusion and BioFire assays had a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 98.7%, followed by the Aptima assay at 94.7% when compared to the consensus result. All three assays exhibited 100% negative percent agreement (NPA). Analysis of discordant results revealed that all four samples missed by the Aptima assay had Ct values >37 on the Fusion assay.

The synthetic analogue poly I:C is frequently used to mimic anti-viral innate immune responses in models of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders including schizophrenia, autism, Parkinsons disease and Alzheimers disease. Many studies perform limited analysis of innate immunity despite these responses potentially differing as a function of dsRNA molecular weight and age. Therefore fundamental questions relevant to impacts of systemic viral infection on brain function and integrity remain. Here, we studied innate immune-inducing properties of poly I:C preparations of different lengths and responses in adult and aged mice. High molecular weight (HMW) poly I:C (1-6kb, 12 mg/kg) produced more robust sickness behavior and more robust IL-6, IFN-I and TNF responses than poly I:C of <500 bases (low MW) preparations. This was partly overcome with higher doses of LMW (up to 80 mg/kg), but neither circulating IFN{beta} nor brain transcription of Irf7 were significantly induced by LMW poly I:C, despite brain Ifnb transcription, suggesting that brain IFN-dependent gene expression is predominantly triggered by circulating IFN{beta} binding of IFNAR1. In aged animals, poly I:C induced exaggerated IL-6, IL-1{beta} and IFN-I in the plasma and similar exaggerated brain cytokine responses. This was associated with acute working memory deficits selectively in aged mice. Thus, we demonstrate dsRNA length-, IFNAR1- and age-dependent effects on anti-viral inflammation and cognitive function.

In this regard, the latest SARS-CoV-2 variant, B.1.1.7 lineage, reported from the United Kingdom (UK) is of great significance, in that it contains several mutations that increases its infection and transmission rates as evidenced by the increased number of clinical reports. Specifically, the N501Y mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) domain has been shown to possess increased affinity for ACE2, although the basis for this not yet clear. Here, we dissect the mechanism underlying the increased affinity using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the available ACE2-S1-RBD complex structure (6M0J) and show a prolonged and stable interaction of the Y501 residue in the N501Y mutant S1-RBD with interfacial residues, Y41 and K353, in ACE2 as compared to the wild type S1-RBD. Additionally, we find that the N501Y mutant S1-RBD displays altered dynamics that likely aids in its enhanced interaction with ACE2.

Following the declaration of the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30th, 2020, it has become imperative to develop diagnostic tools to reliably detect the virus in infected patients. Several methods based on real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA have been developed. In addition, these methods have been recommended by the WHO for laboratory diagnosis. Since all these protocols are based on the use of fluorogenic probes and one-step reagents (cDNA synthesis followed by PCR amplification in the same tube), these techniques can be difficult to perform given the limited supply of reagents in low and middle income countries. In the interest of economy, time and availability of chemicals and consumables, the SYBR Green-based detection was implemented to establish a convenient assay. Therefore, we adapted one of WHO recommended Taqman-based one-step real time PCR protocols (from the University of Hong Kong) to SYBR Green.

The potential animal reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 are currently unknown, however sequence analysis has provided plausible potential candidate species. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enable its entry into host cells and establish infection. We analyzed the binding surface of ACE2 from several important animal species to begin to understand the parameters for the ACE2 recognition by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). We employed Shannon entropy analysis to determine the variability of ACE2 across its sequence and particularly in its RBD interacting region, and assessed differences between various species ACE2 and human ACE2. As cattle are a known reservoir for coronaviruses with previous human zoonotic transfer, and has a relatively divergent ACE2 sequence, we compared the binding kinetics of bovine and human ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. This revealed a nanomolar binding affinity for bovine ACE2 but an approximate ten-fold reduction of binding compared to human ACE2. Since cows have been experimentally infected by SARS-CoV-2, this lower affinity sets a threshold for sequences with lower homology to human ACE2 to be able to serve as a productive viral receptor for SARS-CoV-2.","NA",91,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.25.354548v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.25.354548v2.full.pdf

However, there is a segment of high amino acid similarity between human SARS-CoV-2 and a pangolin isolated strain, GD410721, in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, a pattern that can be caused by either recombination or by convergent amino acid evolution driven by natural selection. We perform a detailed analysis of the synonymous divergence, which is less likely to be affected by selection than amino acid divergence, between human SARS-CoV-2 and related strains. We show that the synonymous divergence between the bat derived viruses and SARS-CoV-2 is larger than between GD410721 and SARS-CoV-2 in the RBD, providing strong additional support for the recombination hypothesis. However, the synonymous divergence between pangolin strain and SARS-CoV-2 is also relatively high, which is not consistent with a recent recombination between them, instead it suggests a recombination into RaTG13. We also find a 14-fold increase in the dN/dS ratio from the lineage leading to SARS-CoV-2 to the strains of the current pandemic, suggesting that the vast majority of non-synonymous mutations currently segregating within the human strains have a negative impact on viral fitness. Finally, we estimate that the time to the most recent common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 or RmYN02 based on synonymous divergence, is 51.71 years (95% C.I., 28.11-75.31) and 37.02 years (95% C.I., 18.19-55.85), respectively.",10.1093/ve/veaa098,33,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.052019v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.052019v3.full.pdf

Despite high sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-1 and -2, each strain has distinctive virulence. A better understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms mediating changes in virulence is needed. Here, we profile the virus-host protein-protein interactions of two hCoV non-structural proteins (nsps) that are critical for virus replication. We use tandem mass tag-multiplexed quantitative proteomics to sensitively compare and contrast the interactomes of nsp2 and nsp4 from three betacoronavirus strains: SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and hCoV-OC43 - an endemic strain associated with the common cold. This approach enables the identification of both unique and shared host cell protein binding partners and the ability to further compare the enrichment of common interactions across homologs from related strains. We identify common nsp2 interactors involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ signaling and mitochondria biogenesis. We also identifiy nsp4 interactors unique to each strain, such as E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes for SARS-CoV-1 and ER homeostasis factors for SARS-CoV-2. Common nsp4 interactors include N-linked glycosylation machinery, unfolded protein response (UPR) associated proteins, and anti-viral innate immune signaling factors. Both nsp2 and nsp4 interactors are strongly enriched in proteins localized at mitochondrial-associated ER membranes suggesting a new functional role for modulating host processes, such as calcium homeostasis, at these organelle contact sites. Our results shed light on the role these hCoV proteins play in the infection cycle, as well as host factors that may mediate the divergent pathogenesis of OC43 from SARS strains.

Our aim was to design a semi-split inactivated vaccine offering a wide range of multi-epitope determinants important for the immune system including not only the spike (S) protein but also the envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. We designed a semi-split vaccine prototype consisting of S protein-depleted viral particles and free S protein. Next, we investigated its immunogenic potential in BALB/c mice. The animals were immunized intradermally or intramuscularly with the dose adjusted with buffer or addition of aluminum hydroxide, respectively. The antibody response was evaluated by plasma analysis at 7 days after the first or second dose. The immune cell response was studied by flow cytometry analysis of splenocytes. The data showed a very early onset of both S protein-specific antibodies and virus-neutralizing antibodies at 90% inhibition regardless of the route of vaccine administration. However, significantly higher levels of neutralizing antibodies were detected in the intradermally (geometric mean titer - GMT of 7.8 {+/-} 1.4) than in the intramuscularly immunized mice (GMT of 6.2 {+/-} 1.5). In accordance with this, stimulation of cellular immunity by the semi-split vaccine was suggested by elevated levels of B and T lymphocyte subpopulations in the murine spleens. These responses were more predominant in the intradermally immunized mice compared with the intramuscular route of administration. The upward trend in the levels of plasmablasts, memory B cells, Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes, including follicular helper T cells, was confirmed even in mice receiving the vaccine intradermally at a dose of 0.5 g.

The primary components of vaping products, vitamin E acetate (VEA) and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) may be responsible for acute lung toxicity. Currently, little information is available on the physiological and biological effects of exposure to these products. We hypothesized that these e-cig cartridges and their constituents (VEA and MCT) induce pulmonary toxicity, mediated by oxidative damage and inflammatory responses, leading to acute lung injury. We studied the potential mechanisms of cartridge aerosol induced inflammatory response by evaluating the generation of reactive oxygen species by MCT, VEA, and cartridges, and their effects on the inflammatory state of pulmonary epithelium and immune cells both in vitro and in vivo. Cells exposed to these aerosols generated reactive oxygen species, caused cytotoxicity, induced epithelial barrier dysfunction, and elicited an inflammatory response. Using a murine model, the parameters of acute toxicity to aerosol inhalation were assessed. Infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes was accompanied by significant increases in IL-6, eotaxin, and G-CSF in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). In mouse plasma, eicosanoid inflammatory mediators, leukotrienes, were significantly increased. Plasma from e-cig users also showed increased levels of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETEs) and various eicosanoids. Exposure to e-cig cartridge aerosols showed the most significant effects and toxicity compared to MCT and VEA. In addition, we determined at SARS-COV-2 related proteins and found no impact associated with aerosol exposures from these tested cartridges. Overall, this study demonstrates acute exposure to specific e-cig cartridges induces in vitro cytotoxicity, barrier dysfunction, and inflammation and in vivo mouse exposure induces acute inflammation with elevated pro-inflammatory markers in the pathogenesis of EVALI.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","NA",322,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.14.151381v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.14.151381v1.full.pdf

In addition, we reveal alternative short and long distance arches around FSE, forming a ""high-order pseudoknot"" embedding FSE, which might help ribosome stalling at frameshift sites. More importantly, we found that within virions, while SARS-CoV-2 genome RNA undergoes intensive compaction, genome cyclization is weakened and genome domains remain stable. Our data provides a structural basis for the regulation of replication, discontinuous transcription and translational frameshifting, describes dynamics of RNA structures during life cycle of SARS-CoV-2, and will help to develop antiviral strategies.","NA",99,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.15.426526v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.15.426526v2.full.pdf

Since December 2019, more than 69,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China and quickly spreads to other counties. Currently, researchers put their best efforts to identify effective drugs for COVID-19. The neutralizing antibody, which binds to viral capsid in a manner that inhibits cellular entry of virus and uncoating of the genome, is the specific defense against viral invaders. In this study, we investigate to identify neutralizing antibodies that can bind to SARS-CoV-2 Sipke (S) protein and interfere with the interaction between viral S protein and a host receptor by bioinformatic methods. The sequence analysis of S protein showed two major differences in the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV related bat viruses (btSARS-CoV). The insertion regions were close to interacting residues with the human ACE2 receptor. Epitope analysis of neutralizing antibodies revealed that SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used conformational epitopes, whereas MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used a common linear epitope region, which contributes to form the {beta}-sheet structure in MERS-CoV S protein and deleted in SARS-CoV-2 S protein. To identify effective neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, the binding affinities of neutralizing antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 S protein were predicted and compared by antibody-antigen docking simulation. The result showed that CR3022 neutralizing antibody from human may have higher binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 S protein than SARS-CoV S protein. We also found that F26G19 and D12 mouse antibodies could bind to SARS-CoV S protein with high affinity.

SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in respiratory epithelial cells motivating the development of alternative and rapidly scalable vaccine inducing mucosal protective and long-lasting immunity. We have previously developed an immunologically optimized multi-neoepitopes-based peptide vaccine platform which has already demonstrated tolerance and efficacy in hundreds of lung cancer patients. Here, we present a multi-target CD8 T cell peptide COVID-19 vaccine design targeting several structural (S, M, N) and non-structural (NSPs) SARS-CoV-2 proteins with selected epitopes in conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We observed that a single subcutaneous injection of a serie of epitopes induces a robust immunogenicity in-vivo as measured by IFN{gamma} ELIspot. Upon tetramer characterization we found that this serie of epitopes induces a strong proportion of virus-specific CD8 T cells expressing CD103, CD44, CXCR3 and CD49a, the specific phenotype of tissue-resident memory T lymphocytes (Trm). Finally, we observed broad cellular responses, as characterized by IFN{gamma} production, upon restimulation with structural and non-structural protein-derived epitopes using blood T cells isolated from convalescent asymptomatic, moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. These data provide insights for further development of a second generation of COVID-19 vaccine focused on inducing lasting Th1-biased memory CD8 T cell sentinels protection using immunodominant epitopes naturally observed after SARS-CoV-2 infection resolution.

Statement of SignificanceHumoral and cellular adaptive immunity are different and complementary immune defenses engaged by the body to clear viral infection. While neutralizing antibodies have the capacity to block virus binding to its entry receptor expressed on human cells, memory T lymphocytes have the capacity to eliminate infected cells and are required for viral clearance. However, viruses evolve quickly, and their antigens are prone to mutations to avoid recognition by the antibodies (phenomenon named  antigenic drift). This limitation of the antibody-mediated immunity could be addressed by the T-cell mediated immunity, which is able to recognize conserved viral peptides from any viral proteins presented by virus-infected cells. Thus, by targeting several proteins and conserved regions on the genome of a virus, T-cell epitope-based vaccines are less subjected to mutations and may work effectively on different strains of the virus. We designed a multi-target T cell-based vaccine containing epitope regions optimized for CD8+ T cell stimulation that would drive long-lasting cellular immunity with high specificity, avoiding undesired effects such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and antibody-induced macrophages hyperinflammation that could be observed in subjects with severe COVID-19. Our in-vivo results showed that a single injection of selected CD8 T cell epitopes induces memory viral-specific T-cell responses with a phenotype of tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm). Trm has attracted a growing interest for developing vaccination strategies since they act as immune sentinels in barrier tissue such as the respiratory tract and the lung. Because of their localization in tissues, they are able to immediately recognize infected cells and, because of their memory phenotypes, they rapidly respond to viral infection by orchestrating local protective immune responses to eliminate pathogens. Lastly, such multiepitope-based vaccination platform uses robust and well-validated synthetic peptide production technologies that can be rapidly manufactured in a distributed manner.","NA",359,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.240093v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.240093v1.full.pdf

In addition to this diversity of consensus genomes across patients, RNA viruses can also display genetic diversity within individual hosts, and co-existing viral variants may affect disease progression and the success of medical interventions. To systematically examine the intra-patient genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2, we processed a large cohort of 3939 publicly-available deeply sequenced genomes with specialised bioinformatics software, along with 749 recently sequenced samples from Switzerland. We found that the distribution of diversity across patients and across genomic loci is very unbalanced with a minority of hosts and positions accounting for much of the diversity. For example, the D614G variant in the Spike gene, which is present in the consensus sequences of 67.4% of patients, is also highly diverse within hosts, with 29.7% of the public cohort being affected by this coexistence and exhibiting different variants. We also investigated the impact of several technical and epidemiological parameters on genetic heterogeneity and found that age, which is known to be correlated with poor disease outcomes, is a significant predictor of viral genetic diversity.

Individual patients may host different versions, or variants, of the virus, hallmarked by different mutations. We examine the diversity of genetic variants coexisting within patients across a cohort of 3939 publicly accessible samples and 749 recently sequenced samples from Switzerland. We find that a small number of patients carry most of the diversity, and that patients with more diversity tend to be older. We also find that most of the diversity is concentrated in certain regions and positions of the virus genome. In particular, we find that a variant reported to increase infectivity is among the most diverse positions.

Further, simulation studies performed up to 100ns agreed that protein complexes M-E, M-S, and M-N were stable. Moreover, the calculated free binding energy and dissociation constant values support the protein complex formation. The interaction identified in the study will be of great importance, as it provides valuable insight into the protein complex, which could be the potential drug targets for future studies.","NA",254,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.363002v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.363002v1.full.pdf

The sustentacular cells and Bowmans gland cells in OE were identified as the major targets of SARS-CoV-2 before the invasion into olfactory sensory neurons. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers cell death and immune cell infiltration, and impairs the uniformity of OE structure. Combined transcriptomic and proteomic analyses reveal the induction of antiviral and inflammatory responses, as well as the downregulation of olfactory receptors in OE from the infected animals.

L.; Campino, S.; Clark, T. G.",Daniel Ward,London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,2020-11-18,2,cc_by_nc_nd,Bioinformatics,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has a major global health and socio-economic burden. It has instigated the mobilisation of resources into the development of control tools, such as diagnostics and vaccines. The poor performance of some diagnostic serological tools has emphasised the need for up to date immune-informatic analyses to inform the selection of viable targets for further study. This requires the integration and analysis of genetic and immunological data for SARS-CoV-2 and its homology with other human coronavirus species to understand cross-reactivity.

MethodsWe have developed an online ""immuno-analytics"" resource to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 research, combining an extensive B/T-cell epitope mapping and prediction meta-analysis, and human CoV sequence homology mapping and protein database annotation, with an updated variant database and geospatial tracking for >7,800 non-synonymous mutation positions derived from >150,000 whole genome sequences. To demonstrate its utility, we present an integrated analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins, both being vaccine and serological diagnostic targets, including an analysis of changes in relevant mutation frequencies over time.

ResultsOur analysis reveals that the nucleocapsid protein in its native form appears to be a sub-optimal target for use in serological diagnostic platforms. The most frequent mutations were the spike protein D614G and nsp12 L314P, which were common (>86%) across all the geographical regions. Some mutations in the spike protein (e.g. A222V and L18F) have increased in frequency in Europe during the latter half of 2020, detected using our automated algorithms. The tool also suggests that orf3a proteins may be a suitable alternative target for diagnostic serologic assays in a post-vaccine surveillance setting.

ConclusionsThe immuno-analytics tool can be accessed online (http://genomics.lshtm.ac.uk/immuno) and will serve as a useful resource for biological discovery and surveillance in the fight against SARS-CoV-2. Further, the tool may be adapted to inform on biological targets in future outbreaks, including potential emerging human coronaviruses that spill over from animal hosts.","NA",26,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.089409v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.089409v2.full.pdf

In contrast, we show that Syrian hamsters are highly permissive to SARS- CoV-2 and develop bronchopneumonia and a strong inflammatory response in the lungs with neutrophil infiltration and edema. Moreover, we identify an exuberant innate immune response as a key player in pathogenesis, in which STAT2 signaling plays a dual role, driving severe lung injury on the one hand, yet restricting systemic virus dissemination on the other. Finally, we assess SARS-CoV- 2-induced lung pathology in hamsters by micro-CT alike used in clinical practice.

Fehr,University of Kansas,2020-10-28,3,cc_by_nc_nd,Biochemistry,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other SARS-like-CoVs encode 3 tandem macrodomains within non-structural protein 3 (nsp3). The first macrodomain, Mac1, is conserved throughout CoVs, and binds to and hydrolyzes mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) from target proteins. Mac1 likely counters host-mediated anti-viral ADP-ribosylation, a posttranslational modification that is part of the host response to viral infections. Mac1 is essential for pathogenesis in multiple animal models of CoV infection, implicating it as a virulence factor and potential therapeutic target. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 exhibit similar structural folds and all 3 proteins bound to ADP-ribose with low M affinities. Importantly, using ADP-ribose detecting binding reagents in both a gel-based assay and novel ELISA assays, we demonstrated de-MARylating activity for all 3 CoV Mac1 proteins, with the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein leading to a more rapid loss of substrate compared to the others. In addition, none of these enzymes could hydrolyze poly-ADP-ribose. We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV Mac1 proteins are MAR-hydrolases with similar functions, indicating that compounds targeting CoV Mac1 proteins may have broad anti-CoV activity.

IMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged into the human population and has led to a worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 that has caused greater than 900 thousand deaths worldwide. With, no currently approved treatments, novel therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. All coronaviruses encode for a highly conserved macrodomain (Mac1) that binds to and removes ADP-ribose adducts from proteins in a dynamic post-translational process increasingly recognized as an important factor that regulates viral infection. The macrodomain is essential for CoV pathogenesis and may be a novel therapeutic target. Thus, understanding its biochemistry and enzyme activity are critical first steps for these efforts. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose, and describe its ADP-ribose binding and hydrolysis activities in direct comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 proteins. These results are an important first step for the design and testing of potential therapies targeting this unique protein domain.","NA",55,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.089375v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.089375v3.full.pdf

A plausible mechanism is androgen-induced expression of TMPRSS2 and/or ACE2 in pulmonary tissues that may increase susceptibility or severity in males. This hypothesis is the subject of several clinical trials of anti-androgen therapies around the world. Here, we investigated the sex-associated TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression in human and mouse lungs and interrogated the possibility of pharmacologic modification of their expression with anti-androgens. We found no evidence for increased TMPRSS2 expression in the lungs of males compared to females in humans or mice. Furthermore, in male mice, treatment with the androgen receptor antagonist enzalutamide did not decrease pulmonary TMPRSS2. On the other hand, ACE2 and AR expression was sexually dimorphic and higher in males than females. ACE2 was moderately suppressible with enzalutamide therapy.

While the Nextstrain and GISAID portals offer widely used systems for the classification of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, both present relevant limitations. Here we propose a highly reproducible method for the systematic classification of SARS-CoV-2 viral types. To demonstrate the validity of our approach, we conduct an extensive comparative genomic analysis of more than 20,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Our classification system delineates 12 clusters and 4 super-clusters in SARS-CoV-2, with a highly biased spatio-temporal distribution worldwide, and provides important observations concerning the evolutionary processes associated with the emergence of novel viral types. Based on the estimates of SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate and genetic distances of genomes of the early pandemic phase, we infer that SARS-CoV-2 could have been circulating in humans since August-November 2019. The observed pattern of genomic variability is remarkably similar between all clusters and super-clusters, being UTRs and the s2m element, a highly conserved secondary structure element, the most variable genomic regions. While several polymorphic sites that are specific to one or more clusters were predicted to be under positive or negative selection, overall, our analyses also suggest that the emergence of novel genome types is unlikely to be driven by widespread convergent evolution and independent fixation of advantageous substitutions. While, in the absence of rigorous experimental validation, several questions concerning the evolutionary processes and the phenotypic characteristics (increased/decreased virulence) remain open, we believe that the approach outlined in this study can be of relevance for the tracking and functional characterization of different types of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.","NA",156,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.172924v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.172924v2.full.pdf

Our method is robust to idiosyncratic errors in the prediction of MHC peptide display and considers target population HLA haplotype frequencies during optimization. To minimize clinical development time our methods validate vaccines with multiple peptide presentation algorithms to increase the probability that a vaccine will be effective. We optimize an objective function that is based on the presentation likelihood of a diverse set of vaccine peptides conditioned on a target population HLA haplotype distribution and expected epitope drift. We produce separate peptide formulations for MHC class I loci (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) and class II loci (HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DR) to permit signal sequence based cell compartment targeting using nucleic acid based vaccine platforms. Our SARS-CoV-2 MHC class I vaccine formulations provide 93.21% predicted population coverage with at least five vaccine peptide-HLA hits on average in an individual ([&ge;] 1 peptide 99.91%) with all vaccine peptides perfectly conserved across 4,690 geographically sampled SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

Spectroscopic data demonstrated that the preferential binding site for DHLA on HSA is IIA (Sudlow I). Hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions were identified as the key binding interactions. DHLA binding thermally stabilized HSA, yet it had no effect on HSA structure and its susceptibility to trypsin digestion. Molecular docking confirmed that Sudlow I site accommodated DHLA in a certain conformation in order for binding to occur. Molecular dynamic simulation showed that formed complex is stable.

To develop a therapeutic drug for COVID-19, a model that can reproduce the viral life cycle and evaluate the drug efficacy of anti-viral drugs is essential. In this study, we established a method to generate human bronchial organoids (hBO) from commercially available cryopreserved human bronchial epithelial cells and examined whether they could be used as a model for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) research. Our hBO contain basal, club, ciliated, and goblet cells. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and transmembrane serine proteinase 2 (TMPRSS2), which is an essential serine protease for priming spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, were highly expressed. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, not only the intracellular viral genome, but also progeny virus, cytotoxicity, pyknotic cells, and moderate increases of the type I interferon signal could be observed. Treatment with camostat, an inhibitor of TMPRSS2, reduced the viral copy number to 2% of the control group. Furthermore, the gene expression profile in SARS-CoV-2-infected hBO was obtained by performing RNA-seq analysis. In conclusion, we succeeded in generating hBO that can be used for SARS-CoV-2 research and COVID-19 drug discovery.

We have used the OT-2 open-source liquid-handling robots (Opentrons, NY), RNA extraction and RT-qPCR reagents to set-up a reproducible workflow for RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2 testing. We developed a framework with a template and several functions and classes that allow the creation of customized RT-qPCR automated circuits. As a proof of concept, we provide data obtained by a fully-functional tested code using the MagMax Pathogen RNA/DNA kit and the MagMax Viral/Pathogen II kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA) on the Kingfisher Flex instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA). With these codes available is easy to create new stations or circuits from scratch, adapt existing ones to changes in the experimental protocol, or perform fine adjustments to fulfil special needs.

The affordability of this platform makes it accessible for most laboratories and hospitals with a bioinformatician, democratising automated SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and increasing, temporarily or not, the capacity of carrying out tests. It also confers flexibility, as this platform is not dependant on any particular commercial kit and can be quickly adapted to protocol changes or other special needs.","NA",133,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.11.140285v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.11.140285v3.full.pdf

A.; Joffrin, L.; Lebarbenchon, C.; Mavingui, P.",David Arthur Wilkinson,UMR Processus Infectieux en Milieu Insulaire Tropical,2020-03-06,1,cc_no,Evolutionary Biology,"The recent reclassification of the Riboviria, and the introduction of multiple new taxonomic categories including both subfamilies and subgenera for coronaviruses (family Coronaviridae, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) represents a major shift in how official classifications are used to designate specific viral lineages. While the newly defined subgenera provide much-needed standardisation for commonly cited viruses of public health importance, no method has been proposed for the assignment of subgenus based on partial sequence data, or for sequences that are divergent from the designated holotype reference genomes. Here, we describe the genetic variation of a partial region of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is one of the most used partial sequence loci for both detection and classification of coronaviruses in molecular epidemiology. We infer Bayesian phylogenies from more than 7000 publicly available coronavirus sequences and examine clade groupings relative to all subgenus holotype sequences. Our phylogenetic analyses are largely coherent with genome-scale analyses based on designated holotype members for each subgenus. Distance measures between sequences form discrete clusters between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can attribute subgenus or indicate sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both accurately and robustly. We thus propose that partial RdRp sequence data of coronaviruses is sufficient for the attribution of subgenus-level taxonomic classifications and we supply the R package, ""MyCoV"", which provides a method for attributing subgenus and assessing the reliability of the attribution.

Importance StatementThe analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplicons derived from biological samples is the most common modern method for detection and classification of infecting viral agents, such as Coronaviruses. Recent updates to the official standard for taxonomic classification of Coronaviruses, however, may leave researchers unsure as to whether the viral sequences they obtain by these methods can be classified into specific viral taxa due to variations in the sequences when compared to type strains. Here, we present a plausible method for defining genetic dissimilarity cut-offs that will allow researchers to state which taxon their virus belongs to and with what level of certainty. To assist in this, we also provide the R package  MyCoV which classifies user generated sequences.","NA",492,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.974311v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.974311v1.full.pdf

This process is part of a viral capping system and is crucial for viral evasion of the innate immune reaction. In light of recently discovered non-canonical RNA caps, we tested various dinucleoside polyphosphate-capped RNAs as substrates for nsp10-nsp16 MTase. We developed an LC-MS-based method and discovered five types of capped RNA (m7Gp3A(G)-, Gp3A(G)- and Gp4A-RNA) that are substrates of the nsp10-nsp16 MTase. Our technique is an alternative to the classical isotope labelling approach for measurement of 2'-O-MTase activity.

Our immune system plays a critical role in preventing, clearing, and treating the virus, but aberrant immune responses can contribute to deleterious symptoms and mortality. Many aspects of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are being investigated, but little is known about immune responses to carbohydrates. Since the surface of the virus is heavily glycosylated, pre-existing antibodies to glycans could potentially recognize the virus and influence disease progression. Furthermore, antibody responses to carbohydrates could be induced, affecting disease severity and clinical outcome. In this study, we used a carbohydrate antigen microarray with over 800 individual components to profile serum anti-glycan antibodies in COVID-19 patients and healthy control subjects. In COVID-19 patients, we observed abnormally high IgG and IgM antibodies to numerous self-glycans, including gangliosides, N-linked glycans, LacNAc-containing glycans, blood group H, and sialyl Lewis X. Some of these anti-glycan antibodies are known to play roles in autoimmune diseases and neurological disorders, which may help explain some of the unusual and prolonged symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients. The detection of antibodies to self-glycans has important implications for using convalescent serum to treat patients, developing safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and understanding the risks of infection. In addition, this study provides new insight into the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and illustrates the importance of including host and viral carbohydrate antigens when studying immune responses to viruses.","NA",461,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.341479v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.341479v1.full.pdf

To enhance immunogenicity and mitigate the potential vaccine-induced immunopathology, CpG 1018, a Th1-biasing synthetic toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist was selected as an adjuvant candidate. S-2P was combined with various adjuvants, including CpG 1018, and administered to mice to test its effectiveness in eliciting anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. S-2P in combination with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide (alum) was found to be the most potent immunogen and induced high titer of spike-specific antibodies in sera of immunized mice. The neutralizing abilities in pseudotyped lentivirus reporter or live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 were measured with reciprocal inhibiting dilution (ID50) titers of 5120 and 2560, respectively.

The test performance characteristics of the Accula (Mesa Biotech) SARS-CoV-2 POC test need to be evaluated to inform its optimal use.

ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to assess test performance of the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test.

Study designThe performance of the Accula test was assessed by comparing results of 100 nasopharyngeal swab samples previously characterized by the Stanford Health Care EUA laboratory-developed test (SHC-LDT) targeting the envelope (E) gene. Assay concordance was assessed by overall percent agreement, positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and Cohens kappa coefficient.

ResultsOverall percent agreement between the assays was 84.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 75.3 to 90.6%), PPA was 68.0% (95% CI 53.3 to 80.5%) and the kappa coefficient was 0.68 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.82). Sixteen specimens detected by the SHC-LDT were not detected by the Accula test, and showed low viral load burden with a median cycle threshold value of 37.7. NPA was 100% (95% CI 94.2 to 100%).

ConclusionCompared to the SHC-LDT, the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test showed excellent negative agreement. However, positive agreement was low for samples with low viral load. The false negative rate of the Accula POC test calls for a more thorough evaluation of POC test performance characteristics in clinical settings, and for confirmatory testing in individuals with moderate to high pre-test probability of SARS-CoV-2 who test negative on Accula.",10.1128/JCM.01072-20,440,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.092379v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.092379v1.full.pdf

Making the problem worse, there is no specific antiviral drug that can be used to treat COVID-19 to date. SARS-CoV-2 initiates its entry into human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) via the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein. Therefore, molecules that can block SARS-CoV-2 from binding to hACE2 may potentially prevent the virus from entering human cells and serve as an effective antiviral drug. Based on this idea, we designed a series of peptides that can strongly bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD in computational experiments. Specifically, we first constructed a 31-mer peptidic scaffold by linking two fragments grafted from hACE2 (a.a. 22-44 and 351-357) with a linker glycine, and then redesigned the peptide sequence to enhance its binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Compared with several computational studies that failed to identify that SARS-CoV-2 shows higher binding affinity for hACE2 than SARS-CoV, our protein design scoring function, EvoEF2, makes a correct identification, which is consistent with the recently reported experimental data, implying its high accuracy. The top designed peptide binders exhibited much stronger binding potency to hACE2 than the wild-type (-53.35 vs. -46.46 EvoEF2 energy unit for design and wild-type, respectively). The extensive and detailed computational analyses support the high reasonability of the designed binders, which not only recapitulated the critical native binding interactions but also introduced new favorable interactions to enhance binding. Due to the urgent situation created by COVID-19, we share these computational data to the community, which should be helpful to develop potential antiviral peptide drugs to combat this pandemic.",10.18632/aging.103416,250,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.013607v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.013607v1.full.pdf

Consequently, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a derivative of CQ, was suggested as the first potentially be therapeutic strategies as they are known to be autophagy inhibitors. Then, they were used as therapeutics in SARS-CoV-2 infection along with remdesivir, for which the FDA approved emergency use authorization. Here, we investigated the antiviral activity and associated mechanism of GNS561, a small basic lipophilic molecule inhibitor of late-stage autophagy, against SARS-CoV-2. Our data indicated that GNS561 showed the highest antiviral effect for two SARS-CoV-2 strains compared to CQ and remdesivir. Focusing on the autophagy mechanism, we showed that GNS561, located in LAMP2-positive lysosomes, together with SARS-CoV-2, blocked autophagy by increasing the size of LC3-II spots and the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm with the presence of multilamellar bodies characteristic of a complexed autophagy. Finally, our study revealed that the combination of GNS561 and remdesivir was associated with a strong synergistic antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our study highlights GNS561 as a powerful drug in SARS-CoV-2 infection and supports that the hypothesis that autophagy inhibitors could be an alternative strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","NA",289,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.06.327635v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.06.327635v1.full.pdf

We identified 368,145 unique combinations of peptide-HLA complexes (pMHCs) with a predicted binding affinity less than 500nM, and observed significant overlap between class I and II predicted pMHCs. Using simulated populations derived from worldwide HLA frequency data, we identified sets of epitopes predicted in at least 90% of the population in 57 countries. We also developed a method to prioritize pMHCs for specific populations.

However, whether the virus spread directly to humans or through an intermediate host is currently unclear, as is the potential for this virus to infect companion animals, livestock and wildlife that could act as viral reservoirs. Using a combination of surrogate entry assays and live virus we demonstrate that, in addition to human ACE2, the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has a broad host tropism for mammalian ACE2 receptors, despite divergence in the amino acids at the Spike receptor binding site on these proteins. Of the twenty-two different hosts we investigated, ACE2 proteins from dog, cat and rabbit were the most permissive to SARS-CoV-2, while bat and bird ACE2 proteins were the least efficiently used receptors. The absence of a significant tropism for any of the three genetically distinct bat ACE2 proteins we examined indicates that SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage likely shifted during zoonotic transmission from bats into people, possibly in an intermediate reservoir. Interestingly, while SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticle entry was inefficient in cells bearing the ACE2 receptor from bats or birds the live virus was still able to enter these cells, albeit with markedly lower efficiency.

MethodsWe downloaded the genomes of 2019-nCoVs and similar isolates from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID and nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Lasergene 7.0 and MEGA 6.0 softwares were used to calculate genetic distances of the sequences, to construct phylogenetic trees, and to align amino acid sequences. Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST software package, was used to calculate the molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs.

ResultsAn isolate numbered EPI_ISL_403928 showed different phylogenetic trees and genetic distances of the whole length genome, the coding sequences (CDS) of ployprotein (P), spike protein (S), and nucleoprotein (N) from other 2019-nCoVs.

SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 was recently shown to co-purify with the host mRNA export factors Rae1 and Nup98. Here, we demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 strongly represses protein expression of co-transfected reporter constructs and imprisons host mRNA in the nucleus, which is associated with its ability to co-purify with Rae1 and Nup98. These protein-protein interactions map to the C-terminus of ORF6 and can be abolished by a single amino acid mutation in Met58. Overexpression of Rae1 restores reporter expression in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6. We further identify an ORF6 mutant containing a 9-amino acid deletion, ORF6 {Delta}22-30, in multiple SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates that can still downregulate the expression of a co-transfected reporter and interact with Rae1 and Nup98. SARS-CoV ORF6 also interacts with Rae1 and Nup98. However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly co-purifies with Rae1 and Nup98 and results in significantly reduced expression of reporter proteins compared to SARS-CoV ORF6, a potential mechanism for the delayed symptom onset and pre-symptomatic transmission uniquely associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

ImportanceSARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is an RNA virus with a large genome that encodes accessory proteins. While these accessory proteins are not required for growth in vitro, they can contribute to the pathogenicity of the virus. One of SARS-CoV-2s accessory proteins, ORF6, was recently shown to co-purify with two host proteins, Rae1 and Nup98, involved in mRNA nuclear export. We demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 interaction with these proteins is associated with reduced expression of a reporter protein and accumulation of poly-A mRNA within the nucleus. SARS-CoV ORF6 also shows the same interactions with Rae1 and Nup98. However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly represses reporter expression and co-purifies with Rae1 and Nup98 compared to SARS-CoV ORF6. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 to more strongly disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport than SARS-CoV ORF6 may partially explain critical differences in clinical presentation between the two viruses.","NA",185,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.03.234559v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.03.234559v1.full.pdf

Two datasets for Sars-CoV-2 infection group and BCG-vaccinated group were downloaded. Differentially Expressed Genes were identified. Gene ontology and pathways were functionally enriched, and networking was constructed in NetworkAnalyst. Lastly, correlation between post-BCG vaccination and COVID-19 transcriptome signatures were established. A total of 161 DEGs (113 upregulated DEGs and 48 downregulated genes) were identified in the Sars-CoV-2 group. In the pathway enrichment analysis, cross-reference of upregulated KEGG pathways in Sars-CoV-2 with downregulated counterparts in the BCG-vaccinated group, resulted in the intersection of 45 common pathways, accounting for 86.5% of SARS-CoV-2 upregulated pathways. Of these intersecting pathways, a vast majority were immune and inflammatory pathways with top significance in IL-17, TNF, NOD-like receptors, and NF-{kappa}B signaling pathways. Our data suggests BCG-vaccination may incur a protective role in COVID-19 patients until a targeted vaccine is developed.

SARS-CoV-2 causes acute infection of the respiratory tract (COVID-19) that can result in severe disease and lethality. Currently, there is no approved antiviral drug for treating COVID-19 patients and there is an urgent need for specific antiviral therapies and vaccines.

In order for SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells, its surface glycoprotein spike (S) must be cleaved at two different sites by host cell proteases, which therefore represent potential drug targets. In the present study we investigated which host cell proteases activate the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells. We show that S can be cleaved by both the proprotein convertase furin at the S1/S2 site and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) at the S2 site. We demonstrate that TMPRSS2 is essential for activation of SARS-CoV-2 S in Calu-3 cells through antisense-mediated knockdown of TMPRSS2 expression. Further, we show that SARS-CoV-2 replication can be efficiently inhibited by two synthetic inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and also by the broad range serine protease inhibitor aprotinin. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 replication was also strongly inhibited by the synthetic furin inhibitor MI-1851. Combining various TMPRSS2 inhibitors with MI-1851 produced more potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 than an equimolar amount of any single serine protease inhibitor. In contrast, inhibition of endosomal cathepsins by E64d did not affect virus replication.

Our data demonstrate that both TMPRSS2 and furin are essential for SARS-CoV-2 activation in human airway cells and are promising drug targets for the treatment of COVID-19 either by targeting one of these proteases alone or by a combination of furin and TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Therefore, this approach has a high therapeutic potential for treatment of COVID-19.","NA",581,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.15.042085v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.15.042085v1.full.pdf

Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 enters and spreads within human organs is crucial for developing strategies to prevent viral dissemination. For many viruses, tissue tropism is determined by the availability of virus receptors on the surface of host cells2. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a host receptor, yet, their tropisms differ3-5. Here, we found that the cellular receptor neuropilin-1 (NRP1), known to bind furin-cleaved substrates, significantly potentiates SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, which was inhibited by a monoclonal blocking antibody against the extracellular b1b2 domain of NRP1. NRP1 is abundantly expressed in the respiratory and olfactory epithelium, with highest expression in endothelial cells and in the epithelial cells facing the nasal cavity. Neuropathological analysis of human COVID-19 autopsies revealed SARS-CoV-2 infected NRP1-positive cells in the olfactory epithelium and bulb. In the olfactory bulb infection was detected particularly within NRP1-positive endothelial cells of small capillaries and medium-sized vessels. Studies in mice demonstrated, after intranasal application, NRP1-mediated transport of virus-sized particles into the central nervous system. Thus, NRP1 could explain the enhanced tropism and spreading of SARS-CoV-2.","NA",94,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.07.137802v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.07.137802v3.full.pdf

The dimeric form of the viral main protease is responsible for the cleavage of the viral polyprotein in 11 sites, including its own N and C-terminus. Although several mechanisms of self-cleavage had been proposed for SARS-CoV, the lack of structural information for each step is a setback to the understanding of this process. Herein, we used X-ray crystallography to characterize an immature form of the main protease, which revealed major conformational changes in the positioning of domain-three over the active site, hampering the dimerization and diminishing its activity. We propose that this form preludes the cis-cleavage of N-terminal residues within the dimer, leading to the mature active site. Using fragment screening, we probe new cavities in this form which can be used to guide therapeutic development. Furthermore, we characterized a serine site-directed mutant of the main protease bound to its endogenous N and C-terminal residues during the formation of the tetramer. This quaternary form is also present in solution, suggesting a transitional state during the C-terminal trans-cleavage. This data sheds light in the structural modifications of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease during maturation, which can guide the development of new inhibitors targeting its intermediary states.","NA",46,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.23.424149v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.23.424149v2.full.pdf

The existing marketed tablet forms of MTK exhibit inconsistent uptake and bioavailability, which partially explains the presence of a significant proportion of MTK low- and non-responders in the population. Besides that, tablets are suboptimal formulations for patients suffering of dysphagia, for example seen in COVID-19 patients or in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers Disease. The increasing interest in repurposing of MTK for the treatment of such patients and the need for an improved bioavailability triggered us to reformulate MTK. The aim was to develop a mucoadhesive MTK film with a good safety and improved pharmacological, i.e. improved bioavailability, profile in humans as well as in a mouse model of Alzheimers Disease.

We tested dissolution of the mucoadhesive film containing MTK in saliva buffer and assessed pharmacoexposure and -kinetics after acute and chronic oral application in mice. Furthermore, we performed a Phase I safety / bioavailability / pharmacokinetic analysis in healthy volunteers. The latter included a comparison with the marketed tablet form as well as a quantitative analysis of the MTK levels in the cerebrospinal fluid.

The novel MTK film demonstrated significantly improved bioavailability compared to the marketed tablet in the clinical phase 1a study in healthy humans. Furthermore, there were measurable amounts of MTK present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at the 3.0 and 7.0 hour time points post drug administration in humans. In mice, MTK was detected in serum and CSF after acute and chronic exposure in a dose-dependent manner.

The developed mucoadhesive film of MTK represents a promising alternative for the tablet delivery. The oral film might lower the non-responder rate in patients with asthma and might be an interesting product for repurposing of MTK in other diseases. As we demonstrate BBB penetrance in a preclinical model as well as in a clinical study, the oral film of MTK might find its use as a therapeutic for acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as dementias and stroke.",10.3390/pharmaceutics13010012,144,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.06.371500v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.06.371500v1.full.pdf

The virus has mutated in three major directions, resulting in three groups to date. Analysis of the basic structure of the group of viruses was completed by April and shared across all continents. However, the virus continued to mutate independently in each country after the borders were closed. In particular, the virus mutated before the occurrence of the second and subsequent peaks. It seems that the mutations conferred higher infectivity to the virus, because of which the virus overcame previously effective protection and caused second waves of the disease. Currently, each country may possess such a unique, stronger variant. Some of them slowly entered other countries and caused epidemics.

It is known that ACE2 functions within the renin-angiotensin system to regulate blood pressure, fluid homeostasis and inflammation. However, it is largely unknown what roles ACE2 has in ciliated cells of the airway. Therefore, understanding the function and nature of ACE2 within airway tissue has become an essential element in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. Airway mucociliary tissue was generated in-vitro using primary human nasal epithelial cells isolated from nasal turbinates of donors and the air-liquid interface (ALI) model of differentiation. Using ALI tissue we cloned transcripts for three distinct variants of ACE2, one of which encodes the full-length ACE2 protein, the other two transcripts are truncated isoforms that had only been predicted to exist via sequence analysis software. We demonstrate that all three isoforms have the capacity to be glycosylated, a known modification of full-length ACE2. Immunofluorescence microscopy of individual ACE2 isoform transfected cells reveals distinct localization of variant 1 relative to X1 and X2. Double staining immunohistochemistry of ALI tissue using antibodies to either the N-term or C-term region of ACE2 revealed distinct and overlapping signals in the apical cytosol of ciliated cells. Most notably only the ACE2 C-term antibody displayed plasma-membrane localization in ciliated cells. We also observed a decrease in the total amount of ACE2 in ALI tissue derived from a 33 year-old male donor when compared to a 34 year-old female donor, thus there may be variation in the abundance of ACE2 protein in the airway among the population. Together, our data begins to highlight the dynamic status of the ACE2 protein in airway mucociliary tissue and we propose multiple ACE2 parameters that may impact an individuals susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. These parameters include the balance of cytosolic versus membrane bound ACE2, isoform expression levels, maintenance of post-translational modifications and the impact of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors on these processes.","NA",70,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.190074v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.190074v2.full.pdf

So far, virus spread has been exclusively contained by non-pharmacological interventions (social distancing, face masks, hand washing and several measures limiting business activities or movement of individuals)1,2. There is a need to find pharmacological interventions to mitigate the viral spread, supporting yet limiting the existing health protection measures while an effective and safe vaccine will hopefully become available. Hypothiocyanite and lactoferrin as part of the innate human immune system were shown to have a large spectrum of cidal activity against bacteria, fungi and viruses2,3. To test their virucidal activity against SARS-CoV-2 we conducted an in-vitro study. Here we show a dose-dependent virucidal activity of hypothiocyanite at micromolar concentrations, slightly improved by the presence of lactoferrin. The two substances are devoid of any cytotoxicity and may be administered combined by aerosol to exploit their antiviral activity at the port of entry (mouth, nasal cavity, conjunctiva) or exit (mouth, through emission of respiratory droplets) of SARS-CoV-2 in the human body. Furthermore, aerosol with hypothiocyanite and lactoferrin combined could also have a therapeutic effect in the lower respiratory tract, at the level of gas exchange units of the lung, preventing the devastating infection of alveolar type II cells where ACE2 is highly expressed.

Such IGHV3-53 antibodies generally have a short CDR H3 due to structural constraints in binding the RBD (mode A). However, a small subset of IGHV3-53 antibodies to the RBD contain a longer CDR H3. Crystal structures of two IGHV3-53 neutralizing antibodies here demonstrate that a longer CDR H3 can be accommodated in a different binding mode (mode B). These two classes of IGHV3-53 antibodies both target the ACE2 receptor binding site, but with very different angles of approach and molecular interactions. Overall, these findings emphasize the versatility of IGHV3-53 in this common antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, where conserved IGHV3-53 germline-encoded features can be combined with very different CDR H3 lengths and light chains for SARS-CoV-2 RBD recognition and virus neutralization.",10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108274,262,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.26.222232v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.26.222232v1.full.pdf

The new coronavirus shares high sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a newly identified bat coronavirus2. While bats may be the reservoir host for various coronaviruses, whether 2019-nCoV has other hosts is still ambiguous. In this study, one coronavirus isolated from Malayan pangolins showed 100%, 98.2%, 96.7% and 90.4% amino acid identity with 2019-nCoV in the E, M, N and S genes, respectively. In particular, the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one amino acid difference. Comparison of available genomes suggests 2019-nCoV might have originated from the recombination of a Pangolin-CoV-like virus with a Bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus. Infected pangolins showed clinical signs and histopathological changes, and the circulating antibodies reacted with the S protein of 2019-nCoV. The isolation of a coronavirus that is highly related to 2019-nCoV in the pangolins suggests that these animals have the potential to act as the intermediate host of 2019-nCoV.

There is a massive amount of under-utilized data and knowledge about RNA viruses highly relevant to SARS-CoV-2 and their hosts proteins. More in-depth and more comprehensive analyses of that knowledge and data can shed new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the COVID-19 pandemic and reveal potential risks.

A machine learning-based method, termed Infection Mechanism and Spectrum Prediction (IMSP), was developed to predict virus-host interactions at both protein and organism levels. Our approach revealed five potential infection targets of SARS-CoV-2, which deserved public health attention, and eight highly possible interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins.

Commonly used phylogenetic trees based on alignments can be used to visualize only a limited number of protein sequences. DGraph, introduced here, is a dynamic programming application developed to generate 2D-maps based on similarity scores for sequences. The program automatically calculates and graphically displays property distance (PD) scores based on physico-chemical property (PCP) similarities from an unaligned list of FASTA files. Such ""PD-graphs"" show the interrelatedness of the sequences, whereby clusters can reveal deeper connectivities.

ResultsPD-Graphs generated for flavivirus (FV), enterovirus (EV), and coronavirus (CoV) sequences from complete polyproteins or individual proteins are consistent with biological data on vector types, hosts, cellular receptors and disease phenotypes. PD-graphs separate the tick- from the mosquito-borne FV, clusters viruses that infect bats, camels, seabirds and humans separately and the clusters correlate with disease phenotype. The PD method segregates the {beta}-CoV spike proteins of SARS, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS sequences from other human pathogenic CoV, with clustering consistent with cellular receptor usage. The graphs also suggest evolutionary relationships that may be difficult to determine with conventional bootstrapping methods that require postulating an ancestral sequence.

After intramuscular injection of DNA vaccine encoding S protein with alum adjuvant (three times at 2-week intervals), the humoral immunoreaction, as assessed by anti-S protein or anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibody titers, and the cellular immunoreaction, as assessed by antigen-induced IFN{gamma} expression, were up-regulated.

We confirmed the neutralizing action of DNA vaccine-induced antibodies via two different methods, a binding assay of RBD recombinant protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and pseudovirus assay. Further B cell epitope mapping analysis using a peptide array showed that most vaccine-induced antibodies recognized the S2 and RBD subunits, but not the S1 subunit.

Therefore, the model interpretability and accuracy are limited, and reasonable signaling pathways are yet to be discovered. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-level attention graph neural network (MLA-GNN), which applies weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to format the omic data of each patient into graph-structured data, and then constructs multi-level graph features, and fuses them through a well-designed multi-level graph feature fully fusion (MGFFF) module to conduct multi-task prediction. Moreover, a novel full-gradient graph saliency mechanism is developed to make the MLA-GNN interpretable. MLA-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on transcriptomic data from TCGA-LGG/TCGA-GBM and proteomic data from COVID-19/non-COVID-19 patient sera.

Here we have used in silico tools to analyze the possible impact of ACE2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the interaction with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein.

The development of efficient drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 requires detailed knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 biology. Several techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection have been established, mainly based on counting infected cells by staining plaques or foci, or by quantifying the viral genome by PCR. These methods are laborious, time-consuming and expensive and therefore not suitable for a high sample throughput or rapid diagnostics. We here report a novel enzyme-based immunodetection assay that directly quantifies the amount of de novo synthesized viral spike protein within fixed and permeabilized cells. This in-cell ELISA enables a rapid and quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in microtiter format, regardless of the virus isolate or target cell culture. It follows the established method of performing ELISA assays and does not require expensive instrumentation. Utilization of the in-cell ELISA allows to e.g. determine TCID50 of virus stocks, antiviral efficiencies (IC50 values) of drugs or neutralizing activity of sera. Thus, the in-cell spike ELISA represents a promising alternative to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and inhibition and may facilitate future research.

M.",David Meybin Wilson,UCSF,2020-12-16,1,cc_by_nc,Biochemistry,"In this study, we developed ACE2-specific, peptide-derived 68Ga-labeled radiotracers, motivated by the hypotheses that (1) ACE2 is an important determinant of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, and (2) that modulation of ACE2 in COVID-19 drives severe organ injury.

MethodsA series of NOTA-conjugated peptides derived from the known ACE2 inhibitor DX600 were synthesized, with variable linker identity. Since DX600 bears two cystine residues, both linear and cyclic peptides were studied. An ACE2 inhibition assay was used to identify lead compounds, which were labeled with 68Ga to generate peptide radiotracers ([68Ga]NOTA-PEP). The aminocaproate-derived radiotracer [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 was subsequently studied in a humanized ACE2 (hACE2) transgenic model.

ResultsCyclic DX-600 derived peptides had markedly lower IC50s than their linear counterparts. The three cyclic peptides with triglycine, aminocaproate, and polyethylene glycol linkers had calculated IC50s similar to, or lower than the parent DX600 molecule. Peptides were readily labeled with 68Ga, and the biodistribution of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 was determined in a hACE2 transgenic murine cohort. Pharmacologic concentrations of co-administered NOTA-PEP (""blocking"") showed significant reduction of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 signals in the in the heart, liver, lungs, and small intestine. Ex vivo hACE2 activity in these organs was confirmed as a correlate to in vivo results.

ConclusionsNOTA-conjugated, cyclic peptides derived from the known ACE2 inhibitor DX600 retain their activity when N-conjugated for 68Ga chelation. In vivo studies in a transgenic hACE2 murine model using the lead tracer [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 showed specific binding in the heart, liver, lungs and intestine - organs known to be affected in SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results suggest that [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 could be used to detect organ-specific suppression of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infected murine models and COVID-19 patients.

We explored 61,485 sequences of the Nucleocapsid (N) protein, a potent diagnostic and prophylactic target, for identifying the mutations to review their roles in RT-PCR based diagnosis and observe consequent impacts. Compared to the Wuhan reference strain, a total of 1034 unique nucleotide mutations were identified in the mutant strains (49.15%, n=30,221) globally. Of these mutations, 367 occupy primer binding sites including 3-end mismatch to primer-pair of 11 well characterized primer sets. Noteworthy, CDC (USA) recommended N2 primer set contained lower mismatch than the other primer sets. Moreover, 684 amino acid (aa) substitutions located across 317 (75.66% of total aa) unique positions including 82, 21, and 83 of those in RNA binding N-terminal domain (NTD), SR-rich region, and C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD), respectively. Moreover, 11 in-frame deletions were revealed, mostly (n =10) within the highly flexible linker region, and the rest within the NTD region. Furthermore, we predicted the possible consequences of high-frequency mutations ([&ge;] 20) and deletions on the tertiary structure of the N protein. Remarkably, we observed that high frequency (67.94% of mutated sequences) coevolving mutations (R203K and G204R) destabilized and decreased overall structural flexibility. Despite being proposed as the alternate target to spike protein for vaccine and therapeutics, ongoing nonsynonymous evolution of the N protein may challenge the endeavors, thus need further immunoinformatics analyses.

SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent for COVID-19, has infected more than 29 million individuals worldwide with nearly ~1 million fatalities. Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 initiates viral pathogenesis is of the utmost importance for development of antiviral drugs. Autophagy modulators have emerged as potential therapeutic candidates against SARS-CoV-2 but recent clinical setbacks underline the urgent need for better understanding the mechanism of viral subversion of autophagy. Using murine hepatitis virus-A59 (MHV-A59) as a model betacoronavirus, time-course infections revealed a significant loss in the protein level of ULK1, a canonical autophagy regulating serine-threonine kinase, and the concomitant appearance of a possible cleavage fragment. To investigate whether virus-encoded proteases target this protein, we conducted in vitro and cellular cleavage assays and identified ULK1 as a novel bona fide substrate of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro). Mutagenesis studies discovered that ULK1 is cleaved at a conserved PLpro recognition sequence (LGGG) after G499, separating its N-terminal kinase domain from the C-terminal substrate recognition region. Consistent with this, over-expression of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro is sufficient to impair starvation-induced canonical autophagy and disrupt formation of ULK1-ATG13 complex. Finally, we demonstrated a dual role for ULK1 in MHV-A59 replication, serving a pro-viral functions during early replication that is inactivated at late stages of infection. In conclusion, our study identified a new mechanism by which PLpro of betacoronaviruses induces viral pathogenesis by targeting cellular autophagic pathway (Word count=250)

Here we report two newly identified adjacent amino acid polymorphisms in the nucleocapsid at positions 203 and 204 (R203K/G204R) due to three adjacent nucleotide changes across the two codons (i.e. AGG GGA to AAA CGA). This new strain within the LGG clade may have arisen by a form of homologous recombination from the core sequence (CS-B) of the transcription-regulating sequences of SAS-CoV-2 itself and has rapidly increased to approximately one third of reported sequences from Europe during the month of March 2020. We note that these polymorphisms are predicted to reduce the binding of an overlying putative HLA-C*07-restricted epitope and that HLA-C*07 is prevalent in Caucasians being carried by >40% of the population.

This novel virus is thought to have originated from an animal reservoir, and acquired the ability to infect human cells using the SARS-CoV cell receptor hACE2. In the wake of a global pandemic it is essential to improve our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics surrounding the origin and spread of a novel infectious disease. One way theory predicts selection pressures should shape viral evolution is to enhance binding with host cells. We first assessed evolutionary dynamics in select betacoronavirus spike protein genes to predict where these genomic regions are under directional or purifying selection between divergent viral lineages at various scales of relatedness. With this analysis, we determine a region inside the receptor-binding domain with putative sites under positive selection interspersed among highly conserved sites, which are implicated in structural stability of the viral spike protein and its union with human receptor hACE2. Next, to gain further insights into factors associated with coronaviruses recognition of the human host receptor, we performed modeling studies of five different coronaviruses and their potential binding to hACE2. Modeling results indicate that interfering with the salt bridges at hot spot 353 could be an effective strategy for inhibiting binding, and hence for the prevention of coronavirus infections. We also propose that a glycine residue at the receptor binding domain of the spike glycoprotein can have a critical role in permitting bat variants of the coronaviruses to infect human cells.",10.1111/eva.12980,134,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.001933v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.001933v1.full.pdf

The identity of these rMCs is still elusive. Among them, Axin2Pos mesenchymal alveolar niche cells (MANCs), which are expressing Fgf7, have been previously described. We propose that an additional population of rMCs, expressing Fgf10 (called rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos) are equally important to maintain AT2 stem cell self-renewal.

The alveolosphere model, based on the AT2-rMC co-culture in growth factor reduced Matrigel, was used to test the efficiency of different rMC subpopulations isolated by FACS from adult murine lung to sustain the self-renewal and differentiation of AT2 stem cells.

We demonstrate that rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos cells are efficient to promote the self-renewal and differentiation of AT2 stem cells. Co-staining of adult lung for Fgf10 mRNA and Sftpc protein respectively, indicate that 28% of Fgf10Pos cells are located close to AT2 cells. Co-ISH for Fgf7 and Fgf10 indicate that these two populations do not significantly overlap. Gene arrays comparing rMC-Sca1PosAxin2Pos and rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos support that these two cell subsets express differential markers. In addition, rMC function is decreased in diabetic and obese ob/ob mutant compared to WT mice with a much stronger loss of function in males compared to females.

In conclusion, rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos cells play important role in supporting AT2 stem cells self-renewal and differentiation. This result sheds a new light on the subpopulations of rMCs contributing to the AT2 stem cell niche in homeostasis and in the context of COVID-19 pathogenesis.

Key messageO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about the subject?C_ST_ABSResident mesenchymal cells (rMCs defined as Cd31NegCd45NegEpcamNeg) control the self-renewal and differentiation of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) stem cells in vitro. The identity of these rMCs is still elusive. Among them, Axin2Pos mesenchymal alveolar niche cells (MANCs), which are expressing Fgf7, have been previously described.

What does this study add?Our study shows that an additional population of rMCs, expressing Fgf10 (called rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos) is equally important to maintain AT2 stem cell self-renewal. rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos are LipidToxHigh and are located close to AT2s. In addition, rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos cells support AT2 stem cell self-renewal and differentiation thereby identifying these cells as bone fide functional lipofibroblasts (LIFs). We have previously reported that LIF can transdifferentiate into activated MYF in the context of bleomycin-induced fibrosis in mice [1] and that activated MYF isolated from the lungs of end stage idiopathic fibrosis human patients can respond to Metformin to undergo transdifferentiation back to the LIF phenotype [2]. We also show that the function of rMCs-Sca1Pos is negatively impacted by gender and obesity, which represent two major aggravating factors for COVID-19 pathogenesis, leading to either death or major complications after infection recovery such as lung fibrosis.

How might this impact on clinical practice and future development?By establishing that rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos are different from the MANCs, our study opens the way for a new key mesenchymal cell population that should be targeted to either prevent or reverse fibrosis. In addition, as this population maintains the AT2 stem cells self-renewal and differentiation, such targeting will also allow to progressively recover the loss in respiratory function.",NA,114,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.28.428090v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.28.428090v1.full.pdf

The current SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) pandemic has caused more than 2,000,000 infections globally and nearly 200,000 deaths. Coronaviruses enter susceptible cells via fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane and/or via fusion of the viral envelope with endosomal membranes after endocytosis of the virus into endosomes. Previous results with SARS and MERS CoV have shown that the Spike (S) glycoprotein is a major determinant of virus infectivity and immunogenicity. Herein, we show that expression of SARS CoV-2 S (S-n) glycoprotein after transient transfection of African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells caused extensive cell fusion in comparison to limited cell fusion caused by the SARS S (S-o) glycoprotein. S-n expression was detected intracellularly and on transfected Vero cell surfaces and caused the formation of very large multinucleated cells (syncytia) by 48 hours post transfection. These results are in agreement with published pathology observations of extensive syncytial formation in lung tissues of COVID-19 patients. This differential S-n versus S-o-mediated cell fusion suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is able to spread from cell-to-cell much more efficiently than SARS effectively avoiding extracellular spaces and neutralizing antibodies. A systematic screening of several drugs for ability to inhibit S-n and S-o cell fusion revealed that the FDA approved HIV-protease inhibitor, nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept) drastically inhibited S-n and S-o-mediated cell fusion in a dose-dependent manner. Complete inhibition of cell fusion was observed at a 10 micromolar concentration. Computational modeling and in silico docking experiments suggested the possibility that nelfinavir may bind inside the S trimer structure, proximal to the S2 amino terminus directly inhibiting S-n and S-o-mediated membrane fusion. Also, it is possible that nelfinavir mesylate acts on cellular processes to inhibit S proteolytic processing. These results warrant further investigations of the potential of nelfinavir mesylate as an antiviral drug, especially at early times after SARS-CoV-2 symptoms appear.",10.1002/jmv.25985,447,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.24.060376v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.24.060376v1.full.pdf

Finding appropriate cell systems for drug screening and testing molecular interactions of the virus with the host cell is mandatory for drug development and understanding the mechanisms of viral entry and replication. For this, we selected human cell lines represented in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) based on RNA-seq data determined transcript levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, two membrane proteins that have been identified to aid SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cell. mRNA and protein expression of these host factors were verified via RQ-PCR and western blot. We then tested permissiveness of these cell lines towards SARS-CoV-2 infection, cytopathic effect, and viral replication finding limited correlation between receptor expression and infectability. One of the candidate cancer cell lines, the human colon cancer cell line CL-14, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data argue that SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection models need careful selection and validation since ACE2/TMPRSS2 receptor expression on its own does not guarantee permissiveness to the virus.

Author summaryIn the midst of the pandemic outbreak of corona-virus SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics for disease treatment are still to be tested and the virus-host-interactions are to be elucidated. Drug testing and viral studies are commonly conducted with genetically manipulated cells. In order to find a cell model system without genetic modification we screened human cell lines for two proteins known to facilitate entry of SARS-CoV-2. We confirmed and quantified permissiveness of current cell line infection models, but dismissed a number of receptor-positive cell lines that did not support viral replication. Importantly, ACE2/TMPRSS2 co-expression seems to be necessary for viral entry but is not sufficient to predict permissiveness of various cancer cell lines. Moreover, the expression of specific splice variants and the absence of missense mutations of the host factors might hint on successful infection and virus replication of the cell lines.","NA",189,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.195040v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.195040v1.full.pdf

Comprehensive assessment of the multifaceted anti-viral antibody response is critical for diagnosis, differentiation of severe disease, and characterization of long-term immunity. Initial observations suggest that severe disease is associated with higher antibody levels and greater B cell/plasmablast responses. A multi-antigen immunoassay to define the complex serological landscape and clinical associations is essential.

MethodsWe developed a multiplex immunoassay and evaluated serum/plasma from adults with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections during acute illness (N=52) and convalescence (N=69); and pre-pandemic (N=106) and post-pandemic (N=137) healthy adults. We measured IgA, IgG, and/or IgM against SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid (N), Spike domain 1 (S1), receptor binding domain (S1-RBD) and S1-N-terminal domain (S1-NTD).

ResultsTo diagnose infection, the combined [IgA+IgG+IgM] or IgG for N, S1, and S1-RBD yielded AUC values -0.90 by ROC curves. From days 6-30 post-symptom onset, the levels of antigen-specific IgG, IgA or [IgA+IgG+IgM] were higher in patients with severe/critical compared to mild/moderate infections. Consistent with excessive concentrations of antibodies, a strong prozone effect was observed in sera from severe/critical patients. Notably, mild/moderate patients displayed a slower rise and lower peak in anti-N and anti-S1 IgG levels compared to severe/critical patients, but anti-RBD IgG and neutralization responses reached similar levels at 2-4 months.

ConclusionThis SARS-CoV-2 multiplex immunoassay measures the magnitude, complexity and kinetics of the antibody response against multiple viral antigens. The IgG and combined-isotype SARS-CoV-2 multiplex assay is highly diagnostic of acute and convalescent disease and may prognosticate severity early in illness.

These samples were collected under varying circumstances and highlight wide variations in their genomic compositions. In this paper, we explore whether these variations characterize the initial temporal change of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. We observe that n-mer distributions in the SARS-CoV-2 samples, which were collected at an earlier period of time, predict its collection timeline with approximately 78% accuracy. However, such a distinctive pattern disappears with the inclusion of samples collected at a later time. We further observe that isolation sources (e.g., oronasopharynx, saliva, feces, etc.) could not be predicted by the n-mer patterns in these sequences.

Especially, it seems that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes vast replication in vivo without being effectively monitored by anti-viral immunity7. Here, we show that the viral protein encoded from open reading frame 8 (ORF8) of SARS-CoV-2, which shares the least homology with SARS-CoV among all the viral proteins, can directly interact with MHC-I molecules and significantly down-regulates their surface expression on various cell types. In contrast, ORF8a and ORF8b of SARS-CoV do not exert this function. In the ORF8-expressing cells, MHC-I molecules are selectively target for lysosomal degradation by an autophagy-dependent mechanism. As a result, CTLs inefficiently eliminate the ORF8-expressing cells. Our results demonstrate that ORF8 protein disrupts antigen presentation and reduces the recognition and the elimination of virus-infected cells by CTLs8. Therefore, we suggest that the inhibition of ORF8 function could be a strategy to improve the special immune surveillance and accelerate the eradication of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.","NA",223,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.24.111823v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.24.111823v1.full.pdf

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses primarily the capsid spike (S) protein to engage with its receptors and infect host cells. To date, it is still not known if the S protein alone, without the other viral elements, is able to trigger vascular cell signalling and provoke cell dysfunction.

MethodsWe investigated the effects of the recombinant, stabilised S protein on primary human cardiac pericytes (PCs) signalling and function. Endpoints included cell viability, proliferation, migration, cooperation with endothelial cells (ECs) in angiogenesis assays, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Adopting a blocking strategy against the S protein receptors ACE2 and CD147, we explored which receptor mediates the S protein signalling in PCs.

FindingsWe show, for the first time, that the recombinant S protein alone elicits functional alterations in cardiac PCs. This was documented as: (1) increased migration, (2) reduced ability to support EC network formation on Matrigel, (3) secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules typically involved in the cytokine storm, and (4) production of pro-apoptotic factors responsible for EC death. Furthermore, the S protein stimulates the phosphorylation/activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) through the CD147 receptor, but not ACE2, in cardiac PCs. Accordingly, the neutralization of CD147, using a blocking antibody, prevented the activation of ERK1/2 and partially rescued the PC function in the presence of the S protein.

InterpretationOur findings suggest the new, intriguing hypothesis that the S protein may elicit vascular cell dysfunction, potentially amplifying, or perpetuating, the damage caused by the whole coronavirus. This mechanism may have clinical and therapeutic implication.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses primarily the capsid spike (S) protein to engage with its receptors and infect host cells. Co-receptors and host cell proteases may also be involved. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the well-recognized entry receptor used by the virus in respiratory epithelial cells; it is also abundantly expressed in the human heart. Alongside ACE2, CD147 has recently emerged as a novel receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Yet, it is not clear if SARS-CoV-2 triggers adverse responses in cardiac vascular mural cells. Likewise, no investigation was devoted to verifying if the recombinant S protein alone can mimic the whole virus signalling.

Added value of this studyThis study provides the first evidence that the recombinant S protein alone, without the other viral elements, is capable of eliciting cellular signalling in human cardiac pericytes, thereby inducing cell dysfunction. In addition, this study proposes CD147 as the leading receptor mediating S protein signalling in cardiac pericytes.

Implications of all the available evidenceThese reports imply that fragments of the S protein might be able to elicit vascular cell dysfunction. Blocking the CD147 receptor may help protect the vasculature not only from infection, but also from the collateral damage caused by the S protein.",NA,295,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.21.423721v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.21.423721v1.full.pdf

Analyses of proteins such as primary receptors and co-receptors (co-factors) that are involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells will provide important clues to help control the virus. Here, we identified host cell membrane protein candidates that were present in proximity to the attachment sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins through the use of proximity labeling and proteomics analysis. The identified proteins represent candidate key factors that may be required for viral entry. Our results indicated that a number of membrane proteins, including DPP4, Cadherin-17, and CD133, were identified to co-localize with cell membrane-bound SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in Caco-2 cells that were used to expand the SARS-CoV-2 virion.

This constitutes major concerns in public health for the current pandemics and potential zoonosis. Previous reports using structural analysis of the viral spike protein (S) binding its cell receptor of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), indicate a broad SARS-CoV2 susceptibility in wild and particularly domestic animals. Through integration of key immunogenetic factors, including the existence of S-binding-void ACE2 isoforms and the disparity of ACE2 expression upon early innate immune response, we further refine the SARS-CoV2 susceptibility prediction to fit recent experimental validation. In addition to showing a broad susceptibility potential across mammalian species based on structural analysis, our results also reveal that domestic animals including dogs, pigs, cattle and goats may evolve ACE2-related immunogenetic diversity to restrict SARS-CoV2 infections. Thus, we propose that domestic animals may be unlikely to play a role as amplifying hosts unless the virus has further species-specific adaptation.

Despite these variations, some bat SARSr-CoVs can utilize the orthologs of human SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entry. It is speculated that the interaction between bat ACE2 and SARSr-CoV spike proteins drives diversity. Here, we have identified a series of R. sinicus ACE2 variants with some polymorphic sites involved in the interaction with the SARS-CoV spike protein. Pseudoviruses or SARSr-CoVs carrying different spike proteins showed different infection efficiency in cells transiently expressing bat ACE2 variants. Consistent results were observed by binding affinity assays between SARS- and SARSr-CoV spike proteins and receptor molecules from bats and humans. All tested bat SARSr-CoV spike proteins had a higher binding affinity to human ACE2 than to bat ACE2, although they showed a 10-fold lower binding affinity to human ACE2 compared with their SARS-CoV counterpart. Structure modeling revealed that the difference in binding affinity between spike and ACE2 might be caused by the alteration of some key residues in the interface of these two molecules. Molecular evolution analysis indicates that these residues were under strong positive selection. These results suggest that the SARSr-CoV spike protein and R. sinicus ACE2 may have coevolved over time and experienced selection pressure from each other, triggering the evolutionary arms race dynamics. It further proves that R. sinicus is the natural host of SARSr-CoVs.

ImportanceEvolutionary arms race dynamics shape the diversity of viruses and their receptors. Identification of key residues which are involved in interspecies transmission is important to predict potential pathogen spillover from wildlife to humans. Previously, we have identified genetically diverse SARSr-CoV in Chinese horseshoe bats. Here, we show the highly polymorphic ACE2 in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. These ACE2 variants support SARS- and SARSr-CoV infection but with different binding affinity to different spike proteins. The higher binding affinity of SARSr-CoV spike to human ACE2 suggests that these viruses have the capacity of spillover to humans. The positive selection of residues at the interface between ACE2 and SARSr-CoV spike protein suggests a long-term and ongoing coevolutionary dynamics between them.

Worldwide, SARS-CoV-2 has already infected over 3 million and has killed about 230,000 people. SARS-CoV-2 originated in China and, within three months, has evolved to an additional 10 subtypes. One particular subtype with a non-silent (Aspartate to Glycine) mutation at 614th position of the Spike protein (D614G) rapidly outcompeted other pre-existing subtypes, including the ancestral. We assessed that D614G mutation generates an additional serine protease (Elastase) cleavage site near the S1-S2 junction of the Spike protein. We also identified that a single nucleotide deletion (delC) at a known variant site (rs35074065) in a cis-eQTL of TMPRSS2, is extremely rare in East Asians but is common in Europeans and North Americans. The delC allele facilitates entry of the 614G subtype into host cells, thus accelerating the spread of 614G subtype in Europe and North America where the delC allele is common. The delC allele at the cis-eQTL locus rs35074065 of TMPRSS2 leads to overexpression of both TMPRSS2 and a nearby gene MX1. The cis-eQTL site, rs35074065 overlaps with a transcription factor binding site of an activator (IRF1) and a repressor (IRF2). IRF1 activator can bind to variant delC allele, but IRF2 repressor fails to bind. Thus, in an individual carrying the delC allele, there is only activation, but no repression. On viral entry, IRF1 mediated upregulation of MX1 leads to neutrophil infiltration and processing of 614G mutated Spike protein by neutrophil Elastase. The simultaneous processing of 614G spike protein by TMPRSS2 and Elastase serine proteases facilitates the entry of the 614G subtype into host cells. Thus, SARS-CoV-2, particularly the 614G subtype, has spread more easily and with higher frequency to Europe and North America where the delC allele regulating expression of TMPRSS2 and MX1 host proteins is common, but not to East Asia where this allele is rare.","NA",545,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.04.075911v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.04.075911v1.full.pdf

In pythons, nidovirus infection induces an inflammation of the upper respiratory and alimentary tract which can develop into a severe and often fatal proliferative pneumonia. We observed pyogranulomatous and fibrinonecrotic lesions in organ systems other than the respiratory tract during full post mortem examinations on 30 nidovirus RT-PCR positive pythons of varying species originating from Switzerland and Spain. The observations prompted us to study whether the atypical tissue tropism associates with previously unknown nidoviruses or changes in the nidovirus genome. RT-PCR and inoculation of Morelia viridis cell cultures served to recruit the cases and to obtain virus isolates. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining against nidovirus nucleoprotein demonstrated that the virus not only infects a broad spectrum of epithelial (respiratory and alimentary epithelium, hepatocytes, renal tubules, pancreatic ducts etc.), but also intravascular monocytes, intralesional macrophages and endothelial cells. By next-generation sequencing we obtained full length genome for a novel nidovirus species circulating in Switzerland. Analysis of viral genomes recovered from pythons showing nidovirus infection-associated respiratory or systemic disease did not explain the observed phenotypes. The results indicate that python nidoviruses have a broad cell and tissue tropism, further suggesting that the course of infection could vary and involve lesions in a broad spectrum of tissues and organ systems as a consequence of monocyte-mediated systemic spread of the virus.

Nidovirales is an order of animal and human viruses that compromise important zoonotic pathogens such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, as well as the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2.

In SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, the strength of the cytokine storm has been associated with increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial damage, and death. However, the therapeutic value of attenuating the cytokine storm in COVID-19 remains to be defined. Here, we report results obtained using a novel mouse model of lethal sterile anti-viral immune responses. Using a mouse model of Down syndrome (DS) with a segmental duplication of a genomic region encoding four of the six interferon receptor genes (Ifnrs), we demonstrate that these animals overexpress Ifnrs and are hypersensitive to IFN stimulation. When challenged with viral mimetics that activate Toll-like receptor signaling and IFN anti-viral responses, these animals overproduce key cytokines, show exacerbated liver pathology, rapidly lose weight, and die. Importantly, the lethal immune hypersensitivity, accompanying cytokine storm, and liver hyperinflammation are blocked by treatment with a JAK1-specific inhibitor. Therefore, these results point to JAK1 inhibition as a potential strategy for attenuating the cytokine storm and consequent organ failure during overdrive immune responses. Additionally, these results indicate that people with DS, who carry an extra copy of the IFNR gene cluster encoded on chromosome 21, should be considered at high risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.

S.; Jamieson, A. M.",Amanda M. Jamieson,Brown University,2020-07-07,1,cc_by_nc_nd,Pathology,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly become a global pandemic. In addition to the acute pulmonary symptoms of COVID-19 (the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection), pulmonary and distal coagulopathies have caused morbidity and mortality in many patients. Currently, the molecular pathogenesis underlying COVID-19 associated coagulopathies are unknown. While there are many theories for the cause of this pathology, including hyper inflammation and excess tissue damage, the cellular and molecular underpinnings are not yet clear. By analyzing transcriptomic data sets from experimental and clinical research teams, we determined that changes in the gene expression of genes important in the extrinsic coagulation cascade in the lung epithelium may be important triggers for COVID-19 coagulopathy. This regulation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade is not seen with influenza A virus (IAV)-infected NHBEs suggesting that the lung epithelial derived coagulopathies are specific to SARS-Cov-2 infection. This study is the first to identify potential lung epithelial cell derived factors contributing to COVID-19 associated coagulopathy.

What did the researchers do and find?O_LIWe analyzed three publicly available RNA sequencing datasets to identify possible molecular etiologies of COVID-19 associated coagulopathies. These data sets include sequencing libraries from clinically isolated samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and healthy controls. We also analyzed a publicly available RNA sequencing dataset derived from in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and mock infected samples.

We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the activation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade and suppression of the plasminogen activation system in both NHBEs and cells isolated from the BALF. PBMCs did not differentially express genes regulating blood coagulation.
C_LIO_LIComparison with influenza A virus (IAV)-infected NHBEs revealed that the regulation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade is unique to SARS-CoV-2, and not seen with IAV infection.

To decipher any correlation between SARS-CoV-2 evolution and its epidemiology in India, we studied the mutational diversity of spike glycoprotein, the key player for the attachment, fusion and entry of virus to the host cell. For this, we analyzed the sequences of 630 Indian isolates as available in GISAID database till June 07, 2020, and detected the spike protein variants to emerge from two major ancestors - Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 and its D614G variant. Average stability of the docked spike protein - host receptor (S-R) complexes for these variants correlated strongly (R2=0.96) with the fatality rates across Indian states. However, while more than half of the variants were found unique to India, 67% of all variants showed lower stability of S-R complex than the respective ancestral variants, indicating a possible fitness loss in recently emerged variants, despite a continuous increase in mutation rate. These results conform to the sharply declining fatality rate countrywide (>7-fold during April 11 - June 28, 2020). Altogether, while we propose the potential of S-R complex stability to track disease severity, we urge an immediate need to explore if SARS-CoV-2 is approaching mutational meltdown in India.

Author summaryEpidemiological features are intricately linked to evolutionary diversity of rapidly evolving pathogens, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. Our work suggests the potential of average stability of complexes formed by the circulating spike mutational variants and the human host receptor to track the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a given region. In India, the stability of these complexes for recent variants tend to decrease relative to their ancestral ones, following countrywide declining fatality rate, in contrast to an increasing mutation rate. We hypothesize such a scenario as nascent footprints of Mullers ratchet, proposing large-scale population genomics study for its validation, since this understanding could lead to therapeutic approaches for facilitating mutational meltdown of SARS-CoV-2, as experienced earlier for influenza A virus.","NA",83,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255570v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255570v2.full.pdf

Surface resonance plasmon (SPR) and Luminex assay showed that the purified S-Ectodomain binding to human ACE-2 and immunoreactivity with COVID-19 positive samples. We demonstrate that bromelain (isolated from pineapple stem and used as a dietary supplement) treatment diminishes the expression of ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 in VeroE6 cells and dramatically lowers the expression of S-Ectodomain. Importantly, bromelain treatment reduced the interaction between S-Ectodomain and VeroE6 cells. Most importantly, bromelain treatment significantly diminished the SARS-CoV-2 infection in VeroE6 cells.

It is not known how phosphorylation controls N protein function. Here we show that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2, together with viral RNA, forms biomolecular condensates12–15. Unmodified N protein forms partially ordered gel-like structures that depend on multivalent RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. Phosphorylation reduces a subset of these interactions, generating a more liquid-like droplet. We speculate that distinct oligomeric states support the two functions of the N protein: unmodified protein forms a structured oligomer that is suited for nucleocapsid assembly, and phosphorylated protein forms a liquid-like compartment for viral genome processing. Inhibitors of N protein phosphorylation could therefore serve as antiviral therapy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",10.1016/j.molcel.2020.11.025,367,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.28.176248v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.28.176248v1.full.pdf

Notably, we found that co-occurrence rates of three significant multi-site co-mutational patterns, i.e., (i) S_a-23403-g, NSP12_c-14408-t, 5UTR_c-241-t, NSP3_c-3037-t, and ORF3a_c-25563-t; (ii) ORF8_t-28144-c, NSP4_c-8782-t, NSP14_c-18060-t, NSP13_a-17858-g, and NSP13_c-17747-t; and (iii) N_g-28881-a, N_g-28882-a, and N_g-28883-c, reached 66%, 90%, and nearly 100% of recent sequences, respectively. Moreover, we found significant decrease of CpG dinucleotide at positions 241(c)-242(g) in the 5UTR during the evolution, which was verified as a potential target of human zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP). The four dominant mutations, three significant multi-site co-mutations, and the potential escape mutation of ZAP-target in 5UTR region contribute to the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the population, thus shaping the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. This study provides valuable clues and frameworks to dissect the viral replication and virus-host interactions for designing effective therapeutics.

Studies of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein receptor binding domain suggest that infection requires binding to HS and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in a codependent manner. Here, we show that commensal host bacterial communities can modify HS and thereby modulate SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding and that these communities change with host age and sex. Common human-associated commensal bacteria whose genomes encode HS-modifying enzymes were identified. The prevalence of these bacteria and the expression of key microbial glycosidases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was lower in adult COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls. The presence of HS-modifying bacteria decreased with age in two large survey datasets, FINRISK 2002 and American Gut, revealing one possible mechanism for the observed increase in COVID-19 susceptibility with age. In vitro, bacterial glycosidases from unpurified culture media supernatants fully blocked SARS-CoV-2 spike binding to human H1299 protein lung adenocarcinoma cells. HS-modifying bacteria in human microbial communities may regulate viral adhesion, and loss of these commensals could predispose individuals to infection. Understanding the impact of shifts in microbial community composition and bacterial lyases on SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to new therapeutics and diagnosis of susceptibility.

The evolutionary origins of the virus remain elusive and understanding its complex mutational signatures could guide vaccine design and development. As part of the international ""CoronaHack"" in April 2020 (https://www.coronahack.co.uk/), we employed a collection of contemporary methodologies to compare the genomic sequences of coronaviruses isolated from human (SARS-CoV-2;n=163), bat (bat-CoV;n=215) and pangolin (pangolin-CoV;n=7) available in public repositories. Following de novo gene annotation prediction, analyses of gene-gene similarity network, codon usage bias and variant discovery were undertaken. Strong host-associated divergences were noted in ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8 and S, and in codon usage bias profiles.

As expected, a significant number of antibodies were directed at the Spike (S) protein, a majority of which recognized the full-length protein. These full-length Spike specific antibodies included a group of somatically hypermutated IgMs. Further, all but one of the six COVID-19 convalescent patients produced class-switched antibodies to a soluble form of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein. Functional properties of anti-Spike antibodies were confirmed in a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Importantly, more than half of all of the antibodies generated were directed at non-S viral proteins, including structural nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins, as well as auxiliary open reading frame-encoded (ORF) proteins. The antibodies were generally characterized as having variable levels of somatic hypermutations (SHM) in all Ig classes and sub-types, and a diversity of VL and VH gene usage.

Reverse transcriptase droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR), a technology that partitions each reaction into 20,000 nanolitre-sized droplets prior to amplification, offers an attractive platform for SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification.

The high transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been attributed to environmental, immunological, and molecular factors. The Spike protein is the foremost molecular factor responsible for virus fusion, entry and spread in the host, and thus holds clues for the rapid viral spread. The dense glycosylation of Spike, its high affinity of binding to the human ACE2 receptor, and the efficient priming by cleavage have already been proposed for driving efficient virus-host entry, but these do not explain its unusually high transmission rate. I have investigated the Spike from six {beta}-coronaviruses, including the SARS-CoV-2, and find that their surface-exposed fusion peptides constituting the defined fusion loop are spatially organized contiguous to each other to work synergistically for triggering the virus-host membrane fusion process. The architecture of the Spike quaternary structure ensures the participation of the fusion peptides in the initiation of the host membrane contact for the virus fusion process. The SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptides have unique physicochemical properties, accrued in part from the presence of consecutive prolines that impart backbone rigidity which aids the virus fusogenicity. The specific contribution of these prolines shows significantly diminished fusogenicity in vitro and associated pathogenesis in vivo, inferred from comparative studies of their deletion-mutant in a fellow murine {beta}-coronavirus MHV-A59. The priming of the Spike by its cleavage and subsequent fusogenic conformational transition steered by the fusion loop may be critical for the SARS-CoV-2 spread.

Significance StatementThe three proximal fusion peptides constituting the fusion loop in Spike protein are the membranotropic segments most suitable for engaging the host membrane surface for its disruption. Spikes unique quaternary structure architecture drives the fusion peptides to initiate the protein host membrane contact. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike trimer surface is relatively more hydrophobic among other human coronavirus Spikes, including the fusion peptides that are structurally more rigid owing to the presence of consecutive prolines, aromatic/hydrophobic clusters, a stretch of consecutive {beta}-branched amino acids, and the hydrogen bonds. The synergy accrued from the location of the fusion peptides, their physicochemical features, and the fusogenic conformational transition appears to drive the virus fusion process and may explain the high spread of the SARS-CoV-2.","NA",63,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191973v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191973v2.full.pdf

Blocking the transition of Spike from its prefusion to post-fusion state might be a strategy to prevent or treat COVID-19. Here we report a single particle cryo-electron microscopy analysis of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric Spike in presence of the human ACE2 ectodomain. The binding of purified hACE2 ectodomain to Spike induces the disassembly of the trimeric form of Spike and a structural rearrangement of its S1 domain to form a stable, monomeric complex with hACE2.

As of 30 March 2020, 7,680 consensus sequences have been shared on GISAID, the principal repository for SARS-CoV-2 genetic information. These sequences are primarily consensus sequences from clinical and passaged samples, but few reports have looked at diversity of virus populations within individual hosts or cultures. Understanding such diversity is essential to understanding viral evolutionary dynamics. Here, we characterize within-host viral diversity from a primary isolate and passaged samples, all originally deriving from an individual returning from Wuhan, China, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 and subsequently sampled in Wisconsin, United States. We use a metagenomic approach with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) GridION in combination with Illumina MiSeq to capture minor within-host frequency variants [&ge;]1%.

Camacho,University of Pittsburgh,2020-07-29,1,cc_by_nd,Biophysics,"Cell surface receptor engagement is a critical aspect of viral infection. At low pH, binding of SARS-CoV and its ACE2 receptor has a tight interaction that catalyzes the fusion of the spike and endosomal membranes followed by genome release. Largely overlooked has been the role of neutral pH in the respiratory tract, where we find that SARS-CoV stabilizes a transition state that enhances the off-rate from its receptor. An alternative pH-switch is found in CoV-2-like coronaviruses of tropical pangolins, but with a reversed phenotype where the tight interaction with ACE2 is at neutral pH. We show that a single point mutation in pangolin-CoV, unique to CoV-2, that deletes the last His residue in their receptor binding domain perpetuates this tight interaction independent of pH. This tight bond, not present in previous respiratory syndromes, implies that CoV-2 stays bound to the highly expressed ACE2 receptors in the nasal cavity about 100 times longer than CoV. This finding supports the unfamiliar pathology of CoV-2, observed virus retention in upper respiratory tract1, longer incubation times and extended periods of shedding. Implications to combat pandemics that, like SARS-CoV-2, export evolutionarily successful strains via higher transmission rates due to retention in nasal epithelium and their evolutionary origin are discussed.","NA",382,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.227389v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.227389v1.full.pdf

Although animal models have been evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 infection, none have recapitulated the severe lung disease phenotypes seen in hospitalized human cases. Here, we evaluate heterozygous transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor driven by the epithelial cell cytokeratin-18 gene promoter (K18-hACE2) as a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice results in high levels of viral infection in lung tissues with additional spread to other organs. Remarkably, a decline in pulmonary function, as measured by static and dynamic tests of respiratory capacity, occurs 4 days after peak viral titer and correlates with an inflammatory response marked by infiltration into the lung of monocytes, neutrophils, and activated T cells resulting in pneumonia. Cytokine profiling and RNA sequencing analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissues show a massively upregulated innate immune response with prominent signatures of NF-kB-dependent, type I and II interferon signaling, and leukocyte activation pathways. Thus, the K18-hACE2 model of SARS-CoV-2 infection recapitulates many features of severe COVID-19 infection in humans and can be used to define the mechanistic basis of lung disease and test immune and antiviral-based countermeasures.","NA",270,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.196188v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.196188v1.full.pdf

Broad spectrum antiviral drugs have a particular advantage when dealing with rapid disease outbreaks, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Since viruses are completely dependent on internal cell mechanisms, they must cross cell membranes during their lifecycle, creating a dependence on processes involving membrane dynamics. Thus, in this study we examined whether the synthesis of glycosphingolipids, biologically active components of cell membranes, can serve as an antiviral therapeutic target. We examined the antiviral effect of two specific inhibitors of GlucosylCeramide synthase (GCS); (i) Genz-123346, an analogue of the FDA-approved drug Cerdelga(R), (ii) GENZ-667161, an analogue of venglustat which is currently under phase III clinical trials. We found that both GCS inhibitors inhibit the replication of four different enveloped RNA viruses of different genus, organ-target and transmission route: (i) Neuroinvasive Sindbis virus (SVNI), (ii) West Nile virus (WNV), (iii) Influenza A virus, and (iv) SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, GCS inhibitors significantly increase the survival rate of SVNI-infected mice. Our data suggest that GCS inhibitors can potentially serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy and should be further examined in preclinical and clinical trial. Analogues of the specific compounds tested have already been studied clinically, implying they can be fast-tracked for public use. With the current COVID-19 pandemic, this may be particularly relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Early, several RT-qPCR were designed by using only the first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence.

ObjectivesA few days later, when additional SARS-CoV-2 genome were retrieved, the kit GPS CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test was designed to provide a highly specific detection method and commercially available worldwide. The kit was validated following criteria recommended by the UNE/EN ISO 17025:2005 and ISO/IEC 15189:2012.

MethodsThe present study approached the in silico specificity of the GPS CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test and RT-qPCR designs currently published. The empirical validation parameters specificity (inclusivity/exclusivity), quantitative phase analysis (10-106 copies), reliability (repeatability/reproducibility) and sensitivity (detection/quantification limits) were evaluated for a minimum of 10-15 assays. Diagnostic validation was achieved by two independent reference laboratories, the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), (Madrid, Spain) and the Public Health England (PHE; Colindale, London, UK).

ResultsThe GPS RT-qPCR primers and probe showed the highest number of mismatches with the closet related non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, including some indels. The kits passed all parameters of validation with strict acceptance criteria. Results from reference laboratories 100% correlated with these obtained by suing reference methods and received an evaluation with 100% of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.

ConclusionsThe GPS CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test, available with full analytical and diagnostic validation, represents a case of efficient transfer of technology being successfully used since the pandemic was declared.

To understand the immunological signature of SARS-CoV-2 infections and aid the search for treatments and vaccines, comprehensive characterization of adaptive immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2 is needed. We investigated the breadth and potency of antibody-, and T-cell immune responses, in 203 recovered SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who presented with asymptomatic to severe infections. We report very broad serological profiles with cross-reactivity to other human coronaviruses. Further, >99% had SARS-CoV-2 epitope specific antibodies, with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and spike-ACE2 receptor interaction blocking observed in 95% of individuals. A significant positive correlation between spike-ACE2 blocking antibody titers and neutralization potency was observed. SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T-cell responses were clear and quantifiable in 90% of HLA-A2+ individuals. The viral surface spike protein was identified as the dominant target for both neutralizing antibodies and CD8+ T cell responses. Overall, the majority of patients had robust adaptive immune responses, regardless of disease severity.

Author summarySARS-CoV-2 can cause severe and deadly infections. However, the immunological understanding of this viral infection is limited. Currently, several vaccines are being developed to help limit transmission and prevent the current pandemic. However, basic understanding of the adaptive immune response developed during SARS-CoV-2 infections is needed to inform further vaccine development and to understand the protective properties of the developed immune response. We investigated, the adaptive immune response developed during SARS-CoV-2 infections in recovered patients experiencing a full spectrum of disease severity, from asymptomatic infections to severe cases requiring hospitalization. We used a novel multiplex serological platform, cell-based neutralization assays and dextramer flow cytometry assays to characterize a broad and robust humoral and cellular immune response towards SARS-CoV-2. We found that the vast majority of recovered individuals have clear detectable and functional SARS-CoV-2 spike specific adaptive immune responses, despite diverse disease severities. The detection of both a humoral and cellular functional spike specific immune response in the vast majority of the individuals, irrespective of asymptomatic manifestations, supports vaccine designs currently underway, and encourages further exploration of whether primary infections provide protection to reinfection.","NA",74,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.08.331645v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.08.331645v2.full.pdf

The protease inhibitor camostat mesylate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells by blocking the virus-activating host cell protease TMPRSS2. Camostat mesylate has been approved for treatment of pancreatitis in Japan and is currently being repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. However, potential mechanisms of viral resistance as well as camostat mesylate metabolization and antiviral activity of metabolites are unclear. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can employ TMPRSS2-related host cell proteases for activation and that several of them are expressed in viral target cells. However, entry mediated by these proteases was blocked by camostat mesylate. The camostat metabolite GBPA inhibited the activity of recombinant TMPRSS2 with reduced efficiency as compared to camostat mesylate and was rapidly generated in the presence of serum. Importantly, the infection experiments in which camostat mesylate was identified as a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor involved preincubation of target cells with camostat mesylate in the presence of serum for 2 h and thus allowed conversion of camostat mesylate into GBPA. Indeed, when the antiviral activities of GBPA and camostat mesylate were compared in this setting, no major differences were identified. Our results indicate that use of TMPRSS2-related proteases for entry into target cells will not render SARS-CoV-2 camostat mesylate resistant. Moreover, the present and previous findings suggest that the peak concentrations of GBPA established after the clinically approved camostat mesylate dose (600 mg/day) will result in antiviral activity.","NA",523,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.237651v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.237651v1.full.pdf

The causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, is a member of the Coronaviridae family, which are viruses that cause respiratory infections of varying severity. The cellular host factors and pathways co-opted by SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in the execution of their life cycles remain ill-defined. To develop an extensive compendium of host factors required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E), we performed parallel genome-scale CRISPR knockout screens. These screens uncovered multiple host factors and pathways with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles, including major dependency on glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, SREBP signaling, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis, as well as an unexpected requirement for several poorly characterized proteins. We identified an absolute requirement for the VTT-domain containing protein TMEM41B for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and all other coronaviruses. This human Coronaviridae host factor compendium represents a rich resource to develop new therapeutic strategies for acute COVID-19 and potential future coronavirus spillover events.

HIGHLIGHTSGenome-wide CRISPR screens for SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E coronavirus host factors.

Parallel genome-wide CRISPR screening uncovered host factors and pathways with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles.

Coronaviruses co-opt multiple biological pathways, including glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, SREBP signaling, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis and anchoring, among others.

Spike glycoprotein is widely considered as a possible target to be explored because of its role during the entry of coronaviruses into host cells. We analyzed 320 whole-genome sequences and 320 spike protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 using multiple sequence alignment tools. In this study, 483 unique variations have been identified among the genomes including 25 non-synonymous mutations and one deletion in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Among the 26 variations detected, 12 variations were located at the N-terminal domain and 6 variations at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which might alter the interaction with receptor molecules. In addition, 22 amino acid insertions were identified in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with that of SARS-CoV. Phylogenetic analyses of spike protein revealed that Bat coronavirus have a close evolutionary relationship with circulating SARS-CoV-2.

The inter-host comparison among viral populations further revealed a narrow transmission bottleneck between patients from the same households, suggesting a dominated role of stochastic dynamics in both inter-host and intra-host evolutions.

Author summaryIn this study, we compared SARS-CoV-2 populations of 13 Chinese COVID-19 patients. Those viral populations contained a considerable proportion of viral sub-genomic messenger RNAs (sgmRNA), reflecting an active viral replication activity in the respiratory tract tissues. The comparison of 66 identified intra-host variants further showed a low viral genetic distance between intra-household patients and a narrow transmission bottleneck size. Despite the co-existence of genetically distinct viruses within the same host, most intra-host minor variants were not shared between transmission pairs, suggesting a dominated role of stochastic dynamics in both inter-host and intra-host evolutions. Furthermore, the narrow bottleneck and active viral activity in the respiratory tract show that the passage of a small number of virions can cause infection.

Our aim was to study colonic ACE2 expression in Crohns disease (CD) and non-inflammatory bowel disease (non-IBD) controls. We hypothesized that the colonic expression levels of ACE2 impacts CD course.

MethodsWe examined the expression of colon ACE2 using RNA-seq and quantitative (q) RT-PCR from 69 adult CD and 14 NIBD control patients. In a subset of this cohort we validated ACE2 protein expression and localization in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded matched colon and ileal tissues using immunohistochemistry. The impact of increased ACE2 expression in CD for the risk of surgery was evaluated by a multivariate regression analysis and a Kaplan-Meier estimator. To provide critical support for the generality of our findings, we analyzed previously published RNA-seq data from two large independent cohorts of CD patients.

ResultsColonic ACE2 expression was significantly higher in a subset of adult CD patients (ACE2-high CD). IHC in a sampling of ACE2-high CD patients confirmed high ACE2 protein expression in the colon and ileum compared to ACE2-low CD and NIBD patients. Notably, we found that ACE2-high CD patients are significantly more likely to undergo surgery within 5 years of diagnosis, with a Cox regression analysis finding that high ACE2 levels is an independent risk factor (OR 2.18; 95%CI, 1.05-4.55; p=0.037).

ConclusionIncreased intestinal expression of ACE2 is associated with deteriorated clinical outcomes in CD patients.

How to learn, access, and retrieve such patterns is crucial in Hopfield networks and the more recent transformer architectures. We show that the attention mechanism of transformer architectures is actually the update rule of modern Hop-field networks that can store exponentially many patterns. We exploit this high storage capacity of modern Hopfield networks to solve a challenging multiple instance learning (MIL) problem in computational biology: immune repertoire classification. Accurate and interpretable machine learning methods solving this problem could pave the way towards new vaccines and therapies, which is currently a very relevant research topic intensified by the COVID-19 crisis. Immune repertoire classification based on the vast number of immunosequences of an individual is a MIL problem with an unprecedentedly massive number of instances, two orders of magnitude larger than currently considered problems, and with an extremely low witness rate. In this work, we present our novel method DeepRC that integrates transformer-like attention, or equivalently modern Hopfield networks, into deep learning architectures for massive MIL such as immune repertoire classification. We demonstrate that DeepRC outperforms all other methods with respect to predictive performance on large-scale experiments, including simulated and real-world virus infection data, and enables the extraction of sequence motifs that are connected to a given disease class.

The clinical and epidemiologic utilities of antibody-based SARS-CoV-2 testing are under debate. Characterizing these assays helps to understand the disease and provides scientific basis for deciding how to best use these assays. The study assessed one chemiluminescent assay (Abbott COVID-2 IgG) and two lateral flow assays (STANDARD Q [SQ] IgM/IgG Duo and Wondfo Total Antibody Test). Validation included 113 blood samples from 71 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients and 1182 samples from negative controls with potential interferences/cross-reactions, including 1063 pre-pandemic samples. IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected as early as post-symptom onset days 3-4. IgG antibodies were first detected post-onset days 5-6 by SQ assays. The detection rates increased gradually, and SQ IgG, Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total detected antibodies from all the PCR-confirmed patients 14 days after symptom onset. Overall agreements between SQ IgM/IgG and Wondfo Total was 88.5% and between SQ IgG and Abbott IgG was 94.6% (Kappa = 0.75, 0.89). No cross-reaction with other endemic coronavirus infections were identified. Viral hepatitis and autoimmune samples were the main cross-reactions observed. However, the interferences/cross-reactions were low. The specificities were 100% for SQ IgG and Wondfo Total and 99.62% for Abbott IgG and 98.87% for SQ IgM.

SARS-CoV-2 infects the airways through ACE2 receptor and the host protease TMPRSS2 was shown to play a major role in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Here, we show that the main component of P. aeruginosa flagella, ie. flagellin is able to increase TMPRSS2 expression in AEC, and even more in those deficient for CFTR.

Small molecule inhibitors that reverse disease severity have proven difficult to discover. One of the key approaches that has been widely applied in an effort to speed up the translation of drugs is drug repurposing. A few drugs have shown in vitro activity against Ebola virus and demonstrated activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. Most notably the RNA polymerase targeting remdesivir demonstrated activity in vitro and efficacy in the early stage of the disease in humans. Testing other small molecule drugs that are active against Ebola virus would seem a reasonable strategy to evaluate their potential for SARS-CoV-2. We have previously repurposed pyronaridine, tilorone and quinacrine (from malaria, influenza, and antiprotozoal uses, respectively) as inhibitors of Ebola and Marburg virus in vitro in HeLa cells and of mouse adapted Ebola virus in mouse in vivo. We have now tested these three drugs in various cell lines (VeroE6, Vero76, Caco-2, Calu-3, A549-ACE2, HUH-7 and monocytes) infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as other viruses (including MHV and HCoV 229E). The compilation of these results indicated considerable variability in antiviral activity observed across cell lines. We found that tilorone and pyronaridine inhibited the virus replication in A549-ACE2 cells with IC50 values of 180 nM and IC50 198 nM, respectively. We have also tested them in a pseudovirus assay and used microscale thermophoresis to test the binding of these molecules to the spike protein. They bind to spike RBD protein with Kd values of 339 nM and 647 nM, respectively. Human Cmax for pyronaridine and quinacrine is greater than the IC50 hence justifying in vivo evaluation. We also provide novel insights into their mechanism which is likely lysosomotropic.","NA",400,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.01.407361v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.01.407361v1.full.pdf

There is a dire need for novel effective antivirals to treat COVID-19, as the only approved direct-acting antiviral to date is remdesivir, targeting the viral polymerase complex. A potential alternate target in the viral life cycle is the main SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CLpro (Mpro). The drug candidate PF-00835231 is the active compound of the first anti-3CLpro regimen in clinical trials. Here, we perform a comparative analysis of PF-00835231, the pre-clinical 3CLpro inhibitor GC-376, and the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, in alveolar basal epithelial cells modified to express ACE2 (A549+ACE2 cells). We find PF-00835231 with at least similar or higher potency than remdesivir or GC-376. A time-of-drug-addition approach delineates the timing of early SARS-CoV-2 life cycle steps in A549+ACE2 cells and validates PF-00835231s early time of action. In a model of the human polarized airway epithelium, both PF-00835231 and remdesivir potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations. Finally, we show that the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein, which was previously suggested to diminish PF-00835231s efficacy based on experiments in monkey kidney Vero E6 cells, does not negatively impact PF-00835231 efficacy in either A549+ACE2 cells or human polarized airway epithelial cultures. Thus, our study provides in vitro evidence for the potential of PF-00835231 as an effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral and addresses concerns that emerged based on prior studies in non-human in vitro models.

ImportanceThe arsenal of SARS-CoV-2 specific antiviral drugs is extremely limited. Only one direct-acting antiviral drug is currently approved, the viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, and it has limited efficacy. Thus, there is a substantial need to develop additional antiviral compounds with minimal side effects and alternate viral targets. One such alternate target is its main protease, 3CLpro (Mpro), an essential component of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle processing the viral polyprotein into the components of the viral polymerase complex. In this study, we characterize a novel antiviral drug, PF-00835231, which is the active component of the first-in-class 3CLpro-targeting regimen in clinical trials. Using 3D in vitro models of the human airway epithelium, we demonstrate the antiviral potential of PF-00835231 for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.","NA",295,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.28.272880v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.28.272880v1.full.pdf

When treatment was initiated before or simultaneously to infection, favipiravir had a strong dose effect, leading to dramatic reduction of infectious titers in lungs and clinical alleviation of the disease. Antiviral effect of favipiravir correlated with incorporation of a large number of mutations into viral genomes and decrease of viral infectivity.

No approved vaccine yet exists for any form of coronavirus. Here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell and B-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties. These epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies. We identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles, and two potential neutralizing B-cell epitopes near the 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor binding domain (440-460 and 494-506). Analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding-change mutations. These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good MHC-I presentation scores (p=0.02). No mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain. Based on these findings, the spike protein is likely immunogenic and a potential vaccine candidate. We validated our computational pipeline with SARS-CoV experimental data.

Significance StatementThe novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has affected more than 100 countries and continues to spread. There is an immediate need for effective vaccines that contain antigens which trigger responses from human T-cells and B-cells (known as epitopes). Here we identify potential T-cell epitopes through an analysis of human antigen presentation, as well as B-cell epitopes through an analysis of protein structure. We identify a list of top candidates, including an epitope located on 2019-nCoV spike protein that potentially triggers both T-cell and B-cell responses. Analyzing 68 samples, we observe that viral mutations are more likely to happen in regions with strong antigen presentation, a potential form of immune evasion.

(H)CQ activity was examined in tissue culture cells to determine if their anti-viral benefits or adverse effects might be due to altering host cell pathways. Metabolic analysis revealed (H)CQ inhibit oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, likely by sequestering protons needed to drive ATP synthase. This activity could cause cardiotoxicity because heart muscle relies on beta oxidation of fatty acids. However, it might also explain their therapeutic benefit against COVID-19. A new model of SARS-CoV-2 infection postulates virus enters host cell mitochondria and uses its protons for genome release. Oxidative phosphorylation is eventually compromised, so glycolysis is upregulated to maintain ATP levels. (H)CQ could prevent viral infection and/or slow its replication by sequestering these protons. In support of this model other potential COVID-19 therapeutics also targeted mitochondria, as did tobacco smoke, which may underlie smokers protection. The mitochondria of young people are naturally more adaptable and resilient, providing a rationale for their resistance to disease progression. Conversely, obesity and diabetes could exacerbate disease severity by providing extra glucose to infected cells dependent on glycolysis.

In COVID-19, the infection and immune hyperactivation causes accumulation of inflammatory immune cells, blood clots, and protein aggregates in lung fluid, increased lung alveolar wall thickness, and upregulation of serum cytokine levels. A serum protein called serum amyloid P (SAP) has a calming effect on the innate immune system and shows efficacy as a therapeutic for fibrosis in animal models and clinical trials. In this report, we show that aspiration of the GU-rich ssRNA oligonucleotide ORN06 into mouse lungs induces all of the above COVID-19-like symptoms. Men tend to have more severe COVID-19 symptoms than women, and in the aspirated ORN06 model, male mice tended to have more severe symptoms than female mice. Intraperitoneal injections of SAP starting from day 1 post ORN06 aspiration attenuated the ORN06-induced increase in the number of inflammatory cells and formation of clot-like aggregates in the mouse lung fluid, reduced ORN06-increased alveolar wall thickness and accumulation of exudates in the alveolar airspace, and attenuated an ORN06-induced upregulation of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1{beta}, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-23, and IL-27 in serum.

On the 16th of May around 4.5 million people got infected and over 300,000 died due to the infection of COV2. The effective treatment remains a challenge. Targeted therapeutics are still under investigation. The papain-like protease (PLPro) from the human SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is a cysteine protease that plays a critical role in virus replication. Its activity is required to process the viral polyprotein into functional, mature subunits. Moreover, COV2 uses this enzyme to modulate the hosts immune system to its own benefit. Therefore, it represents a highly promising target for the development of antiviral drugs.

In this work, we discovered that ebselen, a synthetic organoselenium drug molecule with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and cytoprotective activity in mammalian cells and cytotoxicity in lower organisms, is a highly active inhibitor of PLProCoV2. We proved that ebselen is a covalent, fast-binding inhibitor of PLProCoV2 exhibiting a low micromolar potency. Furthermore, we identified a difference between PLPro from SARS-CoV-1 (the corona virus which caused the 2002-2004 outbreak, SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 that allows to explain the difference in dynamics of the replication, and, thus, the disease progression. Namely, we present that they show differences in the binding affinity of substrates that we observed through kinetics and molecular docking studies. Using a novel Approximate Bayesian Computation method we were able to find kinetic constants for both enzymes. Molecular modeling study on the structure of the active site and binding mode of the ebselen with SARS and COV2 showed also significant differences that could explain our observation that ebselen is less active and slower bounding with SARS than COV2.

In conclusion, we show that ebselen inhibits the activity of the essential viral enzyme papain-like protease (PLpro) from SARS-COV-2 in low micromolar range.","NA",551,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.17.100768v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.17.100768v1.full.pdf

Epithelial cells are central to the pathogenesis of multiple lung diseases. In chronic diseases, increasing age is a principle risk factor. In acute diseases, such as COVID-19, children suffer less severe symptoms than adults and have a lower rate of mortality. Few studies have explored differences between airway epithelial cells in children and adults to explain this age dependent variation in diseases. Here, we perform bulk RNA sequencing studies in laser-capture microdissected whole epithelium, FACS-sorted basal cells and cultured basal cells, as well as in vitro cell proliferation experiments, to address the intrinsic molecular differences between paediatric and adult airway basal cells. We find that, while the cellular composition of the paediatric and adult tracheobronchial epithelium is broadly similar, in cell culture, paediatric airway epithelial cells displayed higher colony forming ability, better in vitro growth and outcompeted adult cells in competitive proliferation assays. In RNA sequencing experiments, we observed potentially important differences in airway epithelial gene expression between samples from children and adults. However, genes known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were not differentially expressed between children and adults. Our results chart cell-intrinsic differences in transcriptional profile and regenerative capacity between proximal airway epithelial cells of children and adults.","NA",224,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.027144v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.027144v1.full.pdf

In this study, we focus on type I interferon (IFN) signaling in human epithelial cells and combine microfluidics, time-lapse microscopy, and computational modeling to investigate how the IFN-responsive regulatory network operates in single cells to process repetitive IFN stimulation. We found that IFN- pretreatments lead to opposite effects, priming versus desensitization, depending on the input durations. These effects are governed by a regulatory network composed of a fast-acting positive feedback loop and a delayed negative feedback loop, mediated by upregulation of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18). We further revealed that USP18 upregulation can only be initiated at the G1 and early S phases of cell cycle upon the treatment onset, resulting in heterogeneous and delayed induction kinetics in single cells. This cell cycle gating provides a temporal compartmentalization of feedback control processes, enabling duration-dependent desensitization to repetitive stimulations. Moreover, our results, highlighting the importance of IFN dynamics, may suggest time-based strategies for enhancing the effectiveness of IFN pretreatment in clinical applications against viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2.",10.7554/eLife.58825,382,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.18.103101v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.18.103101v1.full.pdf

Distinct clinical features in these patients have led to speculation that the immune response to virus in the SARS-CoV-2-infected alveolus differs from other types of pneumonia [2]. We collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 86 patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure and 252 patients with known or suspected pneumonia from other pathogens and subjected them to flow cytometry and bulk transcriptomic profiling. We performed single cell RNA-Seq in 5 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples collected from patients with severe COVID-19 within 48 hours of intubation. In the majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at the onset of mechanical ventilation, the alveolar space is persistently enriched in alveolar macrophages and T cells without neutrophilia. Bulk and single cell transcriptomic profiling suggest SARS-CoV-2 infects alveolar macrophages that respond by recruiting T cells. These T cells release interferon-gamma to induce inflammatory cytokine release from alveolar macrophages and further promote T cell recruitment. Our results suggest SARS-CoV-2 causes a slowly unfolding, spatially-limited alveolitis in which alveolar macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 transcripts and T cells form a positive feedback loop that drives progressive alveolar inflammation.

The activity of Miglustat is here demonstrated for SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations achievable in the plasma by current clinical regimens without cytotoxicity. The drug acts at the post-entry level and leads to a marked decrease of viral proteins and release of infectious virus. The mechanism resides in the inhibitory activity towards -glucosidases that are involved in early stages of glycoprotein N-linked oligosaccharide processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a marked decrease of the viral Spike protein.

Therefore, molecular entities able to interfere with binding of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to ACE2 have a great potential to inhibit viral entry. Starting from the available structural data on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and the host ACE2 receptor, we here engineered a mini-protein with the aim of creating a soluble and stable Spike interactor. This mini-protein, which was recombinantly produced in high yields, possesses a stable  helical conformation and is able to interact with the RBD of glycosylated Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 with nanomolar affinity, as measured by microscale thermophoresis. By plugging the Spike protein, our mini-protein constitutes a valid tool for the development of treatments against different types of coronavirus.","NA",511,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.067728v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.067728v1.full.pdf

The viral spike (S) glycoprotein binds the receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) ACE2 and promotes SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. The trimeric S protein binds the receptor using the distal receptor-binding domain (RBD) causing conformational changes in S protein that allow priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling the dynamic structural features used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal novel therapeutic targets. Using structures determined by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, we performed structural analysis and atomic comparisons of the different conformational states adopted by the SARS-CoV-2-RBD.

ResultsHere, we determined the key structural components induced by the receptor and characterized their intramolecular interactions. We show that {kappa}-helix (also known as polyproline II) is a predominant structure in the binding interface and in facilitating the conversion to the active form of the S protein. We demonstrate a series of conversions between switch-like {kappa}-helix and {beta}-strand, and conformational variations in a set of short -helices which affect the proximal hinge region. This conformational changes lead to an alternating pattern in conserved disulfide bond configurations positioned at the hinge, indicating a possible disulfide exchange, an important allosteric switch implicated in viral entry of various viruses, including HIV and murine coronavirus. The structural information presented herein enables us to inspect and understand the important dynamic features of SARS-CoV-2-RBD and propose a novel potential therapeutic strategy to block viral entry.

Consistently, these antibodies effectively neutralized pseudovirus entry into hACE2 overexpressed 293T cells. In Vero-E6 cells, these antibodies can even block the entry of live SARS-CoV-2 into cells at only 12.5 nM. These results suggest that these neutralizing human antibodies from the patient-derived antibody libraries have the potential to become therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants in this global pandemic.","NA",510,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.06.137513v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.06.137513v1.full.pdf

We therefore compared the functional properties of the S proteins with aspartic acid (SD614) and glycine (SG614) at residue 614. We observed that retroviruses pseudotyped with SG614 infected ACE2-expressing cells markedly more efficiently than those with SD614. This greater infectivity was correlated with less S1 shedding and greater incorporation of the S protein into the pseudovirion. Similar results were obtained using the virus-like particles produced with SARS-CoV-2 M, N, E, and S proteins. However, SG614 did not bind ACE2 more efficiently than SD614, and the pseudoviruses containing these S proteins were neutralized with comparable efficiencies by convalescent plasma. These results show SG614 is more stable than SD614, consistent with epidemiological data suggesting that viruses with SG614 transmit more efficiently.",10.1038/s41467-020-19808-4,610,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.148726v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.148726v1.full.pdf

Considering the presence of Nsp1 in the post-termination 80S ribosomal complex simultaneously with eRF1, we hypothesized that Nsp1 may be involved in translation termination. Using a cell-free translation system and reconstituted in vitro translation system, we show that Nsp1 stimulates translation termination in the stop codon recognition stage at all three stop codons. This stimulation targets the release factor 1 (eRF1) and does not affect the release factor 3 (eRF3). The activity of Nsp1 in translation termination is provided by its N-terminal domain and the minimal required part of eRF1 is NM domain. We assume that biological meaning of Nsp1 activity in translation termination is binding with the 80S ribosomes translating host mRNAs and removal them from the pool of the active ribosomes.","NA",73,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.11.377739v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.11.377739v2.full.pdf

While the well-known poly-ADP-ribosylating (PARylating) PARPs primarily function in the DNA damage response, many non-canonical mono-ADP-ribosylating (MARylating) PARPs are associated with cellular antiviral responses. We recently demonstrated robust upregulation of several PARPs following infection with Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV), a model coronavirus. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection strikingly upregulates MARylating PARPs and induces the expression of genes encoding enzymes for salvage NAD synthesis from nicotinamide (NAM) and nicotinamide riboside (NR), while downregulating other NAD biosynthetic pathways. We show that overexpression of PARP10 is sufficient to depress cellular NAD and that the activities of the transcriptionally induced enzymes PARP7, PARP10, PARP12 and PARP14 are limited by cellular NAD and can be enhanced by pharmacological activation of NAD synthesis. We further demonstrate that infection with MHV induces a severe attack on host cell NAD+ and NADP+. Finally, we show that NAMPT activation, NAM and NR dramatically decrease the replication of an MHV virus that is sensitive to PARP activity.

C.",Scott C Weaver,University of Texas Medical Branch,2020-07-15,1,cc_no,Microbiology,"With continued expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic, antiviral drugs are desperately needed to treat patients at high risk of life-threatening disease and even to limit spread if administered early during infection. Typically, the fastest route to identifying and licensing a safe and effective antiviral drug is to test those already shown safe in early clinical trials for other infections or diseases. Here, we tested in vitro oleandrin, derived from the Nerium oleander plant and shown previously to have inhibitory activity against several viruses. Using Vero cells, we found that prophylactic oleandrin administration at concentrations down to 0.05 g/ml exhibited potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, with an 800-fold reduction in virus production, and a 0.1 g/ml dose resulted in a greater than 3,000-fold reduction in infectious virus production. The EC50 values were 11.98ng/ml when virus output was measured at 24 hours post-infection, and 7.07ng/ml measured at 48 hours post-infection. Therapeutic (post-infection) treatment up to 24 hours after infection of Vero cells also reduced viral titers, with the 0.1 g/ml dose causing greater than 100-fold reductions as measured at 48 hours, and the 0.05 g/ml dose resulting in a 78-fold reduction. The potent prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral activities demonstrated here strongly support the further development of oleandrin to reduce the severity of COVID-19 and potentially also to reduce spread by persons diagnosed early after infection.

IMPORTANCECOVID-19, a pandemic disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, has swept around the world to cause millions of infections and hundreds-of-thousands of deaths due to the lack of vaccines and effective therapeutics. We tested oleandrin, derived from the Nerium oleander plant and shown previously to reduce the replication of several viruses, against SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cells. When administered both before and after virus infection, nanogram doses of oleandrin significantly inhibited replication by up to 3,000-fold, indicating the potential to prevent disease and virus spread in persons recently exposed to SARS-CoV-2, as well as to prevent severe disease in persons at high risk. These results indicate that oleandrin should be tested in animal models and in humans exposed to infection to determine its medical usefulness in controlling the pandemic.","NA",434,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.203489v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.203489v1.full.pdf

Social Network Analysis technique was used to build cooperation networks and apply metrics that characterize these connections. There was an evaluation of statistics of Strength of cooperation and Unilateral dependence of cooperation that identify the cooperation strength between two organizations, and the dependence of this relations. A total of 415 clinical trial were identified, of which 42% are in cooperation. From organizations that have partnership, firms are the first, followed by universities. We extracted the main categories that concentrate 74% of partnerships in the trials of antibody, and vaccine. Several organizations cooperate in multiple categories of trials, evidencing the efforts to focus on different strategies to treat the disease. We found high strength of cooperation and an assimetryc dependency between partners, which can be assigned to specialized models of partnership and it occurs in competitive enviroments like this pandemic moment.

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic is an RNA virus prone to mutations. Formation of a stable binding interface between the Spike (S) protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) of host actuates viral entry. Yet, how this binding interface evolves as virus acquires mutations during pandemic remains elusive. Here, using a high fidelity bioinformatics pipeline, we analysed 31,403 SARS-CoV-2 genomes across the globe, and identified 444 non-synonymous mutations that cause 49 distinct amino acid substitutions in the RBD. Molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested independent emergence of these RBD mutants during pandemic. In silico structure modelling of interfaces induced by mutations on residues which directly engage ACE2 or lie in the near vicinity revealed molecular rearrangements and binding energies unique to each RBD mutant. Comparative structure analysis using binding interface from mouse that prevents SARS-CoV-2 entry uncovered minimal molecular determinants in RBD necessary for the formation of stable interface. We identified that interfacial interaction involving amino acid residues N487 and G496 on either ends of the binding scaffold are indispensable to anchor RBD and are well conserved in all SARS-like corona viruses. All other interactions appear to be required to locally remodel binding interface with varying affinities and thus may decide extent of viral transmission and disease outcome. Together, our findings propose the modalities and variations in RBD-ACE2 interface formation exploited by SARS-CoV-2 for endurance.

ImportanceCOVID-19, so far the worst hit pandemic to mankind, started in January 2020 and is still prevailing globally. Our study identified key molecular arrangements in RBD-ACE2 interface that help virus to tolerate mutations and prevail. In addition, RBD mutations identified in this study can serve as a molecular directory for experimental biologists to perform functional validation experiments. The minimal molecular requirements for the formation of RBD-ACE2 interface predicted using in silico structure models may help precisely design neutralizing antibodies, vaccines and therapeutics.

Ever since the start of SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19 pandemic, countless uncertainties have been revolving around the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. While air pollution has been shown to be strongly correlated to increased SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality, whether environmental pollutants such as ground level ozone affects the susceptibility of individuals to SARS-CoV-2 is not yet established.

ObjectiveTo investigate the impact of ozone inhalation on the expression levels of signatures associated with host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsWe analyzed lung tissues collected from mice that were sub-chronically exposed to air or 0.8ppm ozone for three weeks (4h/night, 5 nights/week), and analyzed the expression of signatures associated with host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells requires proteolytic priming by the host-derived protease, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). The TMPRSS2 protein and Tmprss2 transcripts were significantly elevated in the extrapulmonary airways, parenchyma, and alveolar macrophages from ozone-exposed mice. A significant proportion of additional known SARS-CoV-2 host susceptibility genes were upregulated in alveolar macrophages and parenchyma from ozone-exposed mice.

ConclusionsOur data indicate that the unhealthy levels of ozone in the environment may predispose individuals to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the severity of this pandemic, and the challenges associated with direct testing of host-environment interactions in clinical settings, we believe that this mice-ozone-exposure based study informs the scientific community of the potentially detrimental effects of the ambient ozone levels determining the host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.","NA",496,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.10.377408v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.10.377408v1.full.pdf

Simian immunodeficiency viruses have been jumping between old world monkeys in West/Central Africa for thousands of years. So why did HIV-1 only emerge in the past century? This study examined the replicative fitness, transmission, restriction, and cytopathogenicity of 26 primate lentiviruses. Pairwise competitions of these primate lentiviruses revealed that SIVcpz had the highest replicative fitness in human or chimpanzee peripheral blood mononuclear cells, even higher fitness than HIV-1 group M strains responsible for 37 million infections worldwide. In contrast the ""HIV-2 lineage"" (SIVsmm, SIVmac, SIVagm, and HIV-2) had the lowest replicative fitness. SIVcpz strains were less inhibited by human restriction factors than the ""HIV-2 lineage"" strains, a restriction that was inversely correlated with replicative fitness. SIVcpz from the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes (Ptt) was slightly more fit in human cells than the strains from Pt schweinfurthii (Pts). However, unlike all other primate lentiviruses (including the HIV-2 lineage), SIVcpz was nonpathogenic in human tonsillar tissue and did not deplete CD4+ T-cells, consistent with the slow or nonpathogenic disease observed in chimpanzees. Despite the close phylogenetic relationship between SIVcpz_Ptt and HIV-1, this epidemic was either caused by cross species transmission of a rare, undiscovered SIVcpz strain of higher virulence or higher virulence differentially evolved among HIV-1 subtypes during the human epidemic.

Author summaryInvasion of wild animal habitats by humans can have devastating consequences for the human population as evident by the HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. With SARS-CoV-2, a recent zoonotic jump, likely from bats, will help to identify a coronavirus progenitor. In contrast, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) jumped into humans over 100 years ago from a possibly extinct sub-species of chimpanzees and/or extinct lineage of SIV. We examined replicative fitness and pathogenesis of 26 different primate lentiviruses in human and chimpanzee primary lymphoid cells from blood and within tonsils. SIV from a specific chimpanzee species and lowland gorillas were the most capable of infecting and replicating in human and chimp lymphoid cells but they did not result in the pathogenesis related to disease in humans. In contrast, SIV from other old world monkeys were pathogenic but could not replicate efficiently in human cells. We propose the main HIV-1 is derived from a distinct jump of a very rare SIV strain in chimps leading to AIDS pandemic.","NA",324,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.13.337303v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.13.337303v1.full.pdf

SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a cytotoxic response of CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, characterized by the simultaneous production of granzyme A and B, as well as perforin within different effector CD8+ T cell subsets. PD-1 expressing CD8+ T cells also produced cytotoxic molecules during acute infection indicating that they were not functionally exhausted. However, in COVID-19 patients over the age of 80 years the cytotoxic T cell potential was diminished, especially in effector memory and terminally differentiated effector CD8+ cells, showing that elderly patients have impaired cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

ImportanceCytotoxic T cells are responsible for the elimination of infected cells and are key players for the control of viruses.

COVID-19 patients with a mild disease course were analyzed for the differentiation status and cytotoxic profile of CD8+ T cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a vigorous cytotoxic CD8+ T cell response. However, this cytotoxic profile of T cells was not detected in COVID-19 patients over the age of 80 years.

Understanding variations between viruses and vaccine strains therefore tends to focus on differences between proteins, which can be characterized through genetic analysis. While such an approach provides vital information about the functioning and interactions of the proteins, it does not yet yield an early-stage pathway towards predicting the efficacy of a vaccine, and so large-scale clinical trials are required to obtain critical information. With the urgency associated with pandemics, including Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) originating from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there is a need for earlier indications of whether a vaccine has the necessary characteristics. Application of the methodology to Dengue and influenza virus particles indicates that temperature and pH during incubation could potentially be exploited to fine-tune the order parameter of VLP-based vaccines to match the corresponding virus. Additionally, utilization of an Ising model plot reveals a clear relationship between case fatality rate and order parameter for distinct virus families.","NA",323,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.08.139907v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.08.139907v1.full.pdf

Due to the similarity to other viruses such as SARS, however, our understanding of the antibody-virus interaction has been largely limited to the genomic sequencing, which poses serious challenges to the containment, vaccine exploration and rapid serum testing. Based on the physical/chemical nature of the interaction, infrared spectroscopy was employed to reveal the binding disparity, when unusual temperature dependence was discovered from the 1550cm-1 absorption band, attributed to the hydrogen bonds by carboxyl/amino groups, binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and closely resembled SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 antibodies. The infrared absorption intensity, associated with the number of hydrogen bonds, was found to increase sharply between 27{degrees}C and 31{degrees}C, with the relative absorbance matches at 37{degrees}C the hydrogen bonding numbers of the two antibody types (19 vs 12). Meanwhile the ratio of bonds at 27{degrees}C, calculated by thermodynamic exponentials rather than by the laymans guess, produces at least 5% inaccuracy. As a result, the specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody will be more conclusive beyond 31{degrees}C, instead of at the usual room temperature of 20{degrees}C - 25{degrees}C, when the vaccine research and antibody diagnosis would likely be undermined. Beyond genomic sequencing, the temperature dependence, as well as the bond number match at 37{degrees}C between relative absorbance and the hydrogen bonding numbers of the two antibody types, are not only of clinical significance in particular, but also of a sample for the physical/chemical understanding of the vaccine-antibody interactions in general.",NA,294,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.21.423787v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.21.423787v1.full.pdf

ICEP4 purified compound (ICEP4) is a recently discovered furocoumarin-related purified compound derived from the roots and seeds of Angelica archangelica (herbal drug). ICEP4-related herbal preparations have been extensively used as active herbal ingredients in traditional medicine treatments in several European countries. Extraction method of patent pending ICEP4 (patent application no. GB2017123.7) has previously shown strong manufacturing robustness, long-lasting stability, and repeated chemical consistency. Here we show that ICEP4 presents a significant in vitro cytoprotective effect in highly virulent-SARS-CoV-2 challenged Vero E6 cellular cultures, using doses of 34.5 and 69 M. No dose-related ICEP4 toxicity was observed in Vero E6 cells, M0 macrophages, B, CD4+ T and CD8+ T lymphocytes, Natural Killer (NK) or Natural Killer T (NKT) cells. No dose-related ICEP4 inflammatory response was observed in M0 macrophages quantified by IL6 and TNF release in cell supernatant. No decrease in survival rate was observed after either 24 hr acute or 21-day chronic exposure in in vivo toxicity studies performed in C. elegans. Therefore, ICEP4 toxicological profile has demonstrated marked differences compared to others vegetal furocoumarins. Successful ICEP4 doses against SARS-CoV-2-challenged cells are within the maximum threshold of toxicity concern (TTC) of furocoumarins as herbal preparation, stated by European Medicines Agency (EMA). The characteristic chemical compounding of ICEP4, along with its safe TTC, allow us to assume that the first-observation of a natural antiviral compound has occurred. The potential druggability of a new synthetic ICEP4-related compound remains to be elucidated. However, well-established historical use of ICEP4-related compounds as herbal preparations may point towards an already-safe, widely extended remedy, which may be ready-to-go for large-scale clinical trials under the EMA emergency regulatory pathway.

The surface coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein is considered as a key factor in host specificity because it mediates infection by receptor-recognition and membrane fusion. Here, the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S protein revealed two B56-binding LxxIxE-like motifs in S1 and S2 subunits that could recruit the host protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The motif in S1 subunit is absent in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Phosphatases and kinases are major players in the regulation of pro-inflammatory responses during pathogenic infections. Moreover, studies have shown that viruses target PP2A in order to manipulate hosts antiviral responses. Recent researches have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is involved in sustained host inflammation. Therefore, by controlling acute inflammation, it is possible to eliminate its dangerous effects on the host. Among efforts to fight COVID-19, the interaction between LxxIxE-like motif and the PP2A-B56-binding pocket could be a target for the discovery and/or development of a bioactive ligand inhibitor for therapeutic purposes. Indeed, a small molecule called Artepillin C (ArtC), a main compound in Brazilian honeybee green propolis, mimics the side chains of LxxLxE motif.

Therefore, in this study, we treated healthy mice with two different doses of HCQ that are comparable to clinically administered doses for 7 days. Psychiatric-like behaviors and the expression of related molecules in the brain were evaluated at two time points, i.e., 24 h and 10 days after drug administration. We found that HCQ increased anxiety behavior at both 24 h and 10 days and enhanced depressive behavior at 24 h. Furthermore, HCQ decreased the mRNA expression of interleukin-1beta and corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh) in the hippocampus and decreased the mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) in both the hippocampus and amygdala. Most of these behavioral and molecular changes were sustained beyond 10 days after drug administration, and some of them were dose-dependent. Although this animal study does not prove that HCQ has a similar effect in humans, it indicates that HCQ poses a significant risk to mental health and suggests that further clinical investigation is essential.

In this brief report, we sought to identify the prevalence of limitations statements in the medRxiv COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 dataset.Methods We combined automated methods with manual review to analyse manuscripts for the presence, or absence, either of a defined limitations section in the text, or as part of the general discussion.Results We identified a structured limitations statement in 28% of the manuscripts, and overall 52% contained at least one mention of a study limitation. Over one-third of manuscripts contained none of the terms that might typically be associated with reporting of limitations. Overall our method performed with precision of 0.97 and recall of 0.91.Conclusion The presence or absence of limitations statements can be identified with reasonable confidence using automated tools.

Critical to the pathogenesis of ARDS is injury to the alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) barrier; clinical recovery requires epithelial regeneration. We previously identified a KRT8hi transitional state that regenerating AEC2s adopt during differentiation into AEC1s, the persistence of which may be pathogenic in pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we hypothesize that ineffectual differentiation of transitional cells into AEC1s without fibrosis may perpetuate barrier permeability and poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19 ARDS. To test this hypothesis, we examined postmortem lung tissue of COVID-19 ARDS patients. We observed extensive AEC1 injury, rare mature AEC2s, and abundant transitional cells. Transitional cells were cuboidal, partially spread or, rarely, flat but did not express AEC1 markers. They formed monolayers on alveolar septa denuded of AEC1s but structurally normal without fibrosis. We conclude that ineffectual AEC1 differentiation from transitional AECs may perpetuate barrier permeability and respiratory failure in COVID-19 ARDS. In contrast to fibrosis, transitional AECs may retain the capacity for physiologic AEC1 regeneration with restoration of normal alveolar architecture and function. Novel therapies to promote AEC1 differentiation from transitional cells may accelerate barrier restitution and clinical recovery in ARDS.","NA",55,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.12.426404v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.12.426404v2.full.pdf

The intra-host genomic variability of SARS-CoV-2 plays a pivotal role in the development of effective antiviral agents and vaccines, but also in the design of accurate diagnostics.

We analyzed NGS data derived from clinical samples of three Chinese patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, in order to identify small- and large-scale intra-host variations in the viral genome. We identified tens of low- or higher-frequency single nucleotide variations (SNVs) with variable density across the viral genome, affecting 7 out of 10 protein-coding viral genes. The majority of these SNVs corresponded to missense changes. The annotation of the identified SNVs but also of all currently circulating strain variations revealed colocalization of intra-host but also strain specific SNVs with primers and probes currently used in molecular diagnostics assays. Moreover, we de-novo assembled the viral genome, in order to isolate and validate intra-host structural variations and recombination breakpoints.

W.",Ronan F Arthur,Stanford University,2020-07-14,2,cc_by_nc_nd,Systems Biology,"The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a significant dilemma for governments across the globe. The public health consequences of inaction are catastrophic; but the economic consequences of drastic action are likewise catastrophic. Governments must therefore strike a balance in the face of these trade-offs. But with critical uncertainty about how to find such a balance, they are forced to experiment with their interventions and await the results of their experimentation. Models have proved inaccurate because behavioral response patterns are either not factored in or are hard to predict. One crucial behavioral response in a pandemic is adaptive social contact: potentially infectious contact between people is deliberately reduced either individually or by fiat; and this must be balanced against the economic cost of having fewer people in contact and therefore active in the labor force. We develop a model for adaptive optimal control of the effective social contact rate within a Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic model using a dynamic utility function with delayed information. This utility function trades off the population-wide contact rate with the expected cost and risk of increasing infections. Our analytical and computational analysis of this simple discrete-time deterministic model reveals the existence of a non-zero equilibrium, oscillatory dynamics around this equilibrium under some parametric conditions, and complex dynamic regimes that shift under small parameter perturbations. These results support the supposition that infectious disease dynamics under adaptive behavior-change may have an indifference point, may produce oscillatory dynamics without other forcing, and constitute complex adaptive systems with associated dynamics. Implications for COVID-19 include an expectation of fluctuations, for a considerable time, around a quasi-equilibrium that balances public health and economic priorities, that shows multiple peaks and surges in some scenarios, and that implies a high degree of uncertainty in mathematical projections.

Author summaryEpidemic response in the form of social contact reduction, such as has been utilized during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, presents inherent tradeoffs between the economic costs of reducing social contacts and the public health costs of neglecting to do so. Such tradeoffs introduce an interactive, iterative mechanism which adds complexity to an infectious disease system. Consequently, infectious disease modeling typically has not included dynamic behavior change that must address such a tradeoff. Here, we develop a theoretical model that introduces lost or gained economic and public health utility through the adjustment of social contact rates with delayed information. We find this model produces an equilibrium, a point of indifference where the tradeoff is neutral, and at which a disease will be endemic for a long period of time. Under small perturbations, this model exhibits complex dynamic regimes, including oscillatory behavior, runaway exponential growth, and eradication. These dynamics suggest that for epidemic response that relies on social contact reduction, secondary waves and surges with accompanied business re-closures and shutdowns may be expected, and that accurate projection under such circumstances is unlikely.","NA",47,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.028407v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.028407v2.full.pdf

ORF3a assemblies as homotetramers, which are stabilized by residue C133. A recent cryoEM structure of a homodimeric complex of ORF3a has been released. A lower-resolution cryoEM map of the tetramer suggests two dimers form it, arranged side by side. The dimers cryoEM structure revealed that each protomer contains three transmembrane helices arranged in a clockwise configuration forming a six helices transmembrane domain. This domains potential permeation pathway has six constrictions narrowing to about 1 [A] in radius, suggesting the structure solved is in a closed or inactivated state. At the cytosol end, the permeation pathway encounters a large and polar cavity formed by multiple beta strands from both protomers, which opens to the cytosolic milieu. We modeled the tetramer following the arrangement suggested by the low-resolution tetramer cryoEM map. Molecular dynamics simulations of the tetramer embedded in a membrane and solvated with 0.5 M of KCl were performed. Our simulations show the cytosolic cavity is quickly populated by both K+ and Cl-, yet with different dynamics. K+ ions moved relatively free inside the cavity without forming proper coordination sites. In contrast, Cl- ions enter the cavity, and three of them can become stably coordinated near the intracellular entrance of the potential permeation pathway by an inter-subunit network of positively charged amino acids.

We demonstrate that the S1-Fc fusion protein is extremely immunogenic, as evidenced by strong antibody titers observed by day 7. Strong virus neutralizing activity was observed on day 14 in rabbits immunized with the S1-Fc fusion protein using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Most importantly, in less than 20 days and three injections of the S1-Fc fusion protein, two monkeys developed higher virus neutralizing titers than a recovered COVID-19 patient in a live SARS-CoV-2 infection assay.

At the cellular surface, electrolytes play an important role, especially in the interaction of proteins near the membrane surface. Additionally, the binding interface of the CoV-2 RBD - ACE2 complex is highly hydrophilic. We simulated the CoV-2 RBD - ACE2 complex at varying salt concentrations over the concentration range from 0.03 M to 0.3 M of calcium and sodium chloride over an individual simulation length of 750 ns in 9 independent simulations (6.75 {micro}s total). We observe that the CoV-2 RBD - ACE2 complex is stabilized independent of the salt concentration. We identify a strong negative electrostatic potential at the N-terminal part of CoV-2 RBD and we find that CoV-2 RBD binds even stronger at higher salt concentrations. We observe that the dynamics of the N-terminal part of CoV-2 RBD stabilize the protein complex leading to strong collective motions and a stable interface between CoV-2 RBD and ACE2. We state that the sequence of CoV-2 RBD might be optimized for a strong binding to ACE2 at varying salt concentrations at the cellular surface, which acts as a key component in the activation of CoV-2 for its viral entry.

The CoV-2 spike protein is a major target for the development of a vaccine and potential strategies to inhibit the viral entry into human cells. At the cellular surface, CoV-2 activation involves the direct interaction between ACE2 and CoV-2 RBD. At the cellular surface, electrolytes play an important role, especially in the interaction of proteins near the membrane surface. We thus investigate the effect of ion conditions on the interaction of the CoV-2 RBD - ACE2 complex and find stabilizing effects.

As the pandemic progresses, information about the modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among humans is critical to apply appropriate infection control measures and to slow its spread. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted efficiently via direct contact and via the air (via respiratory droplets and/or aerosols) between ferrets. Intranasal inoculation of donor ferrets resulted in a productive upper respiratory tract infection and long-term shedding, up to 11 to 19 days post-inoculation. SARS-CoV-2 transmitted to four out of four direct contact ferrets between 1 and 3 days after exposure and via the air to three out of four independent indirect recipient ferrets between 3 and 7 days after exposure. The pattern of virus shedding in the direct contact and indirect recipient ferrets was similar to that of the inoculated ferrets and infectious virus was isolated from all positive animals, showing that ferrets were productively infected via either route. This study provides experimental evidence of robust transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via the air, supporting the implementation of community-level social distancing measures currently applied in many countries in the world and informing decisions on infection control measures in healthcare settings 3.",10.1038/s41467-020-17367-2,378,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.044503v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.044503v1.full.pdf

An effective antiviral coating can decrease the viability of the virus particles in the outside environment significantly, hence reducing their transmission rate. In this work, we have screened a series of nanoparticles and their composites for antiviral activity using Nano Luciferase based highly sensitive influenza A reporter virus. Using this screening system, we have identified copper-graphene (Cu-Gr) nanocomposite shows strong antiviral activity. Extensive material and biological characterization of the nanocomposite suggested a unique metal oxide embedded graphene sheet architecture that can inactivate the virion particles only within 30 minutes of pre-incubation and subsequently interferes with the entry of these virion particles into the host cell. This ultimately results in reduced viral gene expression, replication and production of progeny virus particles, slowing down the overall pace of progression of infection.

Here, we present both pMHC and TCR-pMHC interfaces to infer peptide epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins.

Also, we applied the structural analysis of the hit peptides from different coronaviruses to highlight a feature of evolution in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, bat-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Peptide-protein flexible docking between each of the hit peptides and their corresponding MHC molecules were performed, and a multi-hit peptides vaccine against the S and N glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was designed. Filtering pipelines including antigenicity, and also physiochemical properties of designed vaccine were then evaluated by different immunoinformatics tools.

G.; Wang, J.; Fernandez, I. S.; Puglisi, J. D.",Joseph D. Puglisi,Stanford University School of Medicine,2020-08-21,1,cc_by_nc_nd,Biophysics,"SARS-CoV-2 recently emerged as a human pathogen and is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. A molecular framework of how the virus manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection remains unclear. Here, we focus on SARS-CoV-2 NSP1, which is proposed to be a virulence factor that inhibits protein synthesis by directly binding the human ribosome. Using extract-based and reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that NSP1 inhibits translation initiation on model human and SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs. NSP1 also specifically binds to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, which is required for translation inhibition. Using single-molecule fluorescence assays to monitor NSP1-40S subunit binding in real time, we demonstrate that eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) modulate the interaction: NSP1 rapidly and stably associates with most ribosomal pre-initiation complexes in the absence of mRNA, with particular enhancement and inhibition by eIF1 and eIF3j, respectively. Using model mRNAs and an inter-ribosomal-subunit FRET signal, we elucidate that NSP1 competes with RNA segments downstream of the start codon to bind the 40S subunit and that the protein is unable to associate rapidly with 80S ribosomes assembled on an mRNA. Collectively, our findings support a model where NSP1 associates with the open head conformation of the 40S subunit to inhibit an early step of translation, by preventing accommodation of mRNA within the entry channel.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. A molecular framework for how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection is needed. Here, we integrate biochemical and single-molecule strategies to reveal molecular insight into how NSP1 from SARS-CoV-2 inhibits translation initiation. NSP1 directly binds to the small (40S) subunit of the human ribosome, which is modulated by human initiation factors. Further, NSP1 and mRNA compete with each other to bind the ribosome. Our findings suggest that the presence of NSP1 on the small ribosomal subunit prevents proper accommodation of the mRNA.

This study revealed that a C-terminal 17 amino acid deletion in SCoV-2 SP significantly increases the incorporation of SP into the pseudotyped viruses and enhanced its infectivity, which may be helpful in the design of SCoV2-SP-based vaccine strategies.

An analysis of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in 30 survivors showed that 26 of those individuals had a CD8+ response to at least one EBOV protein. The dominant response (25/26 subjects) was specific to the EBOV nucleocapsid protein (NP). It has been suggested that epitopes on the EBOV NP could form an important part of an effective T-cell vaccine for Ebola Zaire. We show that a 9-amino-acid peptide NP44-52 (YQVNNLEEI) located in a conserved region of EBOV NP provides protection against morbidity and mortality after mouse adapted EBOV challenge. A single vaccination in a C57BL/6 mouse using an adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine formulation containing NP44-52 is enough to confer immunity in mice. Our work suggests that a peptide vaccine based on CD8+ T-cell immunity in EBOV survivors is conceptually sound and feasible.

J.; James, D. C.; Green, L. R.; Monk, P. N.",Luke R Green,University of Sheffield,2020-07-17,2,cc_by_nd,Microbiology,"The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is known to bind to the receptor, ACE2, on the surface of target cells. The spike protein is processed by membrane proteases, including TMPRSS2, and either internalises or fuses directly with the cell, leading to infection. We have identified a human cell line that expresses both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the RT4 urinary bladder transitional carcinoma, and used it to develop a proxy assay for viral interactions with host cells. A tagged recombinant form of the spike protein, containing both the S1 and S2 domains, interacted strongly with RT4 cells as determined by flow cytometry, whereas the S1 domain and the receptor binding domain (RBD) interacted weakly. S1S2 interaction was temperature dependent and increased sharply at 37{degrees}C, suggesting that processing of the intact spike protein is likely to be important in the interaction. S1S2 protein could associate with cells with a low dependence on ACE2 expression, while RBD required the presence of ACE2 for interaction. As the spike protein has previously been shown to bind heparin, a soluble glycosaminoglycan, we used a flow cytometric assay to determine the effect of heparin on spike protein interaction with RT4 cells. Unfractionated heparin inhibited spike protein interaction with an IC50 value of <0.05U/ml whereas two low molecular weight heparins were much less effective. A mutant form of the spike protein, lacking the Arg-rich region proposed to be a furin cleavage site, interacted very weakly with cells and had a lower affinity for unfractionated and lower molecular weight heparin than the wild type spike protein. This indicates that the furin cleavage site might also be a heparin binding site and potentially important in interactions with host cells. Taken together, our data suggest that heparin, particularly unfractionated forms, could be considered to reduce clinical manifestations of COVID-19 by inhibiting continuing viral infection.

Author SummarySince the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, the world has faced a vast public health crisis. SARS-CoV-2 associates with human cells through interaction of the viral spike protein with the host receptor, ACE2. In the absence of a vaccine, new treatments are required to reduce the morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we use a novel technique to demonstrate spike protein interactions with human cells with low levels of ACE2 at the cell surface, suggesting a secondary receptor. We demonstrate the importance of a new heparin-binding site within the viral spike protein for these interactions. We also found that unfractionated heparin was able to bind to the viral spike protein and therefore, potently inhibit viral spike protein interactions with human cells. Our data demonstrate that ACE2 is not absolutely required for spike protein interactions with human cells and furthermore, that unfractionated heparin should be considered as a treatment to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral infection.","NA",73,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.107870v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.107870v2.full.pdf

The paired CD4 conserved residues, including the matched CD4 interacting MHC-II epitopes of the structural viral protein domains, were chosen for the protein modelling using the SWISS-MODEL online server. Energy minimization and structural validation of the modelled viral protein domains, including the CD4 and MHC-II protein were achieved by CHIMERA and PROCHECK-Ramachandran Plot respectively. Protein-protein docking was performed by the HADDOCK online tool. The binding affinity score was measured using the PRODIGY online server.

As per our docking report, the Env gp120 of HIV-1 with three identical and three conserved residues of CD4 exhibited the highest binding affinity (-13.9 kcal/mol) with MHC-II than the second-highest RBD-S1-SARS-CoV-2 (-12.5 kcal/mol) with three identical and a single conserved residue of CD4. With a noticeable single salt bridge formation identified at the interacting residues Lys305 (of Env gp120-HIV-1) and Glu139 (of MHC-II); the Env gp120 interaction with MHC-II occupied the crucial His144 and Glu194 (salt-bridge) interacting residues of CD4 with the measured buried surface area 2554.8{+/-}40.8 [A]2.

In contrast to replication-association RNA structure, GORS was poorly conserved in the positions and identities of base pairing with other sarbecoviruses - even similarly positioned stem-loops in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV rarely shared homologous pairings, indicative of more rapid evolutionary change in RNA structure than in the underlying coding sequences. Sites predicted to be base-paired in SARS-CoV-2 showed substantially less sequence diversity than unpaired sites, suggesting that disruption of RNA structure by mutation imposes a fitness cost on the virus which is potentially restrictive to its longer evolution. Although functionally uncharacterised, GORS in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses represent important elements in their cellular interactions that may contribute to their persistence and transmissibility.",10.1128/mbio.01661-20,362,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.17.155200v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.17.155200v1.full.pdf

To date, there are few therapeutic interventions able to affect the course of the disease once acquired, a deficit with stark consequences that were readily evident in the current COVID-19 pandemic. We present the Cellular Immune Agent Based Model (CIABM) as a flexible framework for modeling acute viral infection and cellular immune memory development. The mechanism/rule-based nature of the CIABM allows for interrogation of the complex dynamics of the human immune system during various types of viral infections. The CIABM is an extension of a prior agent-based model of the innate immune response, incorporating additional cellular types and mediators involved in the response to viral infection. The CIABM simulates the dynamics of viral respiratory infection in terms of epithelial invasion, immune cellular population changes and cytokine measurements. Validation of the CIABM involved effectively replicating in vivo measurements of circulating mediator levels from a clinical cohort of influenza patients. The general purpose nature of the CIABM allows for both the representation of various types of known viral infections and facilitates the exploration of hypothetical, novel viral pathogens.","NA",8,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/663930v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/663930v3.full.pdf

Rhythmic respiratory (RR) coupling of wide-spread forebrain activity was confirmed using advanced techniques, including current source density analysis, single unit firing, and phase modulation of local gamma activity, creating solid premise for investigating how higher networks use this mechanism in their communication. Here we show essential differences in the way prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HC) process the RR signal from the olfactory bulb (OB) allowing dynamic PFC-HC coupling utilizing this input. We used inter-regional coherences and their correlations in rats, breathing at low rate ([~]2 Hz) at rest, outside of the short sniffing bouts. We found strong and stable OB-PFC coherence, contrasting OB-HC coherence which was low but highly variable. PFC-HC coupling, however, primarily correlated with the latter, indicating that HC access to the PFC output is dynamically regulated by the responsiveness of HC to the common rhythmic drive. This pattern was present in both theta and non-theta states of waking, whereas PFC-HC communication appeared protected from RR synchronization in sleep states. The findings help to understand the mechanism of rhythmic modulation of non-olfactory cognitive processes by the on-going regular respiration, reported in rodents as well as humans. These mechanisms may be impaired when nasal breathing is limited or in OB-pathology, including malfunctions of the OB epithelium due to infections, such as in COVID-19.","NA",24,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.04.077461v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.04.077461v2.full.pdf

A.",Igor A Kaltashov,University of Massachusetts-Amherst,2020-06-10,1,cc_no,Biochemistry,"The emergence and rapid proliferation of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in a global pandemic, with over six million cases and nearly four hundred thousand deaths reported world-wide by the end of May 2020. A rush to find the cures prompted re-evaluation of a range of existing therapeutics vis-a-vis their potential role in treating COVID-19, placing a premium on analytical tools capable of supporting such efforts. Native mass spectrometry (MS) has long been a tool of choice in supporting the mechanistic studies of drug/therapeutic target interactions, but its applications remain limited in the cases that involve systems with a high level of structural heterogeneity. Both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-protein), a critical element of the viral entry to the host cell, and ACE2, its docking site on the host cell surface, are extensively glycosylated, making them challenging targets for native MS. However, supplementing native MS with a gas-phase ion manipulation technique (limited charge reduction) allows meaningful information to be obtained on the non-covalent complexes formed by ACE2 and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein. Using this technique in combination with molecular modeling also allows the role of heparin in destabilizing the ACE2/RBD association to be studied, providing critical information for understanding the molecular mechanism of its interference with the virus docking to the host cell receptor. Both short (pentasaccharide) and relatively long (eicosasaccharide) heparin oligomers form 1:1 complexes with RBD, indicating the presence of a single binding site. This association alters the protein conformation (to maximize the contiguous patch of the positive charge on the RBD surface), resulting in a notable decrease of its ability to associate with ACE2. The destabilizing effect of heparin is more pronounced in the case of the longer chains due to the electrostatic repulsion between the low-pI ACE2 and the heparin segments not accommodated on the RBD surface. In addition to providing important mechanistic information on attenuation of the ACE2/RBD association by heparin, the study demonstrates the yet untapped potential of native MS coupled to gas-phase ion chemistry as a means of facilitating rational repurposing of the existing medicines for treating COVID-19.

To gain insights, we performed high-throughput sequencing that generated time-series data simultaneously for bioinformatics analysis of virus genomes and host transcriptomes implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our analysis results showed that the rapid growth of the virus was accompanied by an early intensive response of host genes. We also systematically compared the molecular footprints of the host cells in response to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Upon infection, SARS-CoV-2 induced hundreds of up-regulated host genes hallmarked by a significant cytokine production followed by virus-specific host antiviral responses. While the cytokine and antiviral responses triggered by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were only observed during the late stage of infection, the host antiviral responses during the SARS-CoV-2 infection were gradually enhanced lagging behind the production of cytokine. The early rapid host responses were potentially attributed to the high efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, underscored by evidence of a remarkably up-regulated gene expression of TPRMSS2 soon after infection.

C.",Sukrit Srivastava,"Indian Foundation for Fundamental Research, India",2020-09-06,1,cc_no,Immunology,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA coronavirus responsible for the ongoing 2019-2020 COVID-19 outbreak. The highly contagious COVID-19 disease has spread to 216 countries in less than six months. Though several vaccine candidates are being claimed, an effective vaccine is yet to come. In present study we have designed and theoretically validated novel Multi-Patch Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

MethodologyA novel reverse epitomics approach, ""overlapping-epitope-clusters-to-patches"" method is utilized to identify multiple antigenic regions from the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. These antigenic regions are here termed as ""Ag-Patch or Ag-Patches"", for Antigenic Patch or Patches. The identification of Ag-Patches is based on clusters of overlapping epitopes rising from a particular region of SARS-CoV-2 protein. Further, we have utilized the identified Ag-Patches to design Multi-Patch Vaccines (MPVs), proposing a novel methodology for vaccine design and development. The designed MPVs were analyzed for immunologically crucial parameters, physiochemical properties and cDNA constructs.

ResultsWe identified 73 CTL (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte), 49 HTL (Helper T-Lymphocyte) novel Ag-Patches from the proteome of SARS-CoV-2. The identified Ag-Patches utilized to design MPVs cover 768 (518 CTL and 250 HTL) overlapping epitopes targeting different HLA alleles. Such large number of epitope coverage is not possible for multi-epitope vaccines. The large number of epitopes covered implies large number of HLA alleles targeted, and hence large ethnically distributed human population coverage. The MPVs:Toll-Like Receptor ectodomain complex shows stable nature with numerous hydrogen bond formation and acceptable root mean square deviation and fluctuation. Further, the cDNA analysis favors high expression of the MPVs constructs in human cell line.

ConclusionHighly immunogenic novel Ag-Patches are identified from the entire proteome of SARS CoV-2 by a novel reverse epitomics approach. We conclude that the novel Multi-Patch Vaccines could be a highly potential novel approach to combat SARS-CoV-2, with greater effectiveness, high specificity and large human population coverage worldwide.

A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 9th to 26th June 2020 among healthcare professionals working at six public hospitals in Addis Ababa. Data were collected using a self-administered structured questionnaire. Frequency, percentage, and mean were used to summarize the data. A binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with risk perception about COVID-19. A total of 1,134 participants were surveyed. Wearing facemask (93%), hand washing for at least 20 seconds (93%), covering mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing (91%), and avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth (91%) were the commonly self-reported preventive practices. About 88% perceived that they were worried about the risk of becoming infected with coronavirus, and majority (91%) worried about the risk of infection to their family.

Leveraging advances in machine learning, we propose a deep learning strategy to map query datasets on top of a reference called single-cell architectural surgery (scArches, https://github.com/theislab/scarches). It uses transfer learning and parameter optimization to enable efficient, decentralized, iterative reference building, and the contextualization of new datasets with existing references without sharing raw data. Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, and whole organism atlases, we showcase that scArches preserves nuanced biological state information while removing batch effects in the data, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters compared to de novo integration. To demonstrate mapping disease variation, we show that scArches preserves detailed COVID-19 disease variation upon reference mapping, enabling discovery of new cell identities that are unseen during training.

Tests for positive selection can identify apparently nonrandom patterns of mutation accumulation within genomes, highlighting regions where molecular function may have changed during the origin of a species. Several recent studies of the SARS-CoV-2 genome have identified signals of conservation and positive selection within the gene encoding Spike protein based on the ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitution. Such tests cannot, however, detect changes in the function of RNA molecules.

MethodsHere we apply a test for branch-specific oversubstitution of mutations within narrow windows of the genome without reference to the genetic code.

ResultsWe recapitulate the finding that the gene encoding Spike protein has been a target of both purifying and positive selection. In addition, we find other likely targets of positive selection within the genome of SARS-CoV-2, specifically within the genes encoding Nsp4 and Nsp16. Homology-directed modeling indicates no change in either Nsp4 or Nsp16 protein structure relative to the most recent common ancestor. Thermodynamic modeling of RNA stability and structure, however, indicates that RNA secondary structure within both genes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome differs from those of RaTG13, the reconstructed common ancestor, and Pan-CoV-GD (Guangdong). These SARS-CoV-2-specific mutations may affect molecular processes mediated by the positive or negative RNA molecules, including transcription, translation, RNA stability, and evasion of the host innate immune system. Our results highlight the importance of considering mutations in viral genomes not only from the perspective of their impact on protein structure, but also how they may impact other molecular processes critical to the viral life cycle.",10.7717/peerj.10234,88,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.16.300038v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.16.300038v2.full.pdf

The present study elucidated the mutational landscape in SARS-CoV-2 genome among the African population, which may have contributed to the virulence, pathogenicity and transmission observed in the region. Multiple sequence alignment of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (356 viral protein sequences) was performed using ClustalX version 2.1 and phylogenetic tree was built using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) X software. ORF1ab polyprotein, spike glycoprotein, ORF3, ORF8 and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein were observed as mutational hotspots in the African population and may be of keen interest in the adaptability of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host. While, there is conservation in the envelope protein, membrane glycoprotein, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF10.

In this study, we tested 1,013 bats belonging to 36 species from Mozambique, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Reunion Island and Seychelles, based on molecular screening and partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene. In total, 88 bats (8.7%) tested positive for coronaviruses, with higher prevalence in Mozambican bats (20.5% {+/-} 4.9%) as compared to those sampled on islands (4.5% {+/-} 1.5%). Phylogenetic analyses revealed a large diversity of - and {beta}-CoVs and a strong signal of co-evolution between CoVs and their bat host species, with limited evidence for host-switching, except for bat species sharing day roost sites.

ImportanceThis is the first study to report the presence of coronaviruses (CoVs) in bats in Mayotte, Mozambique and Reunion Island, and in insectivorous bats in Madagascar. Eight percent of the tested bats were positive for CoVs, with higher prevalence in continental Africa than on islands. A high genetic diversity of - and {beta}-CoVs was found, with strong association between bat host and virus phylogenies, supporting a long history of co-evolution between bats and their associated CoVs in the Western Indian Ocean.

While there is moderate evidence of diversifying positive selection in SARS-CoV-2 in humans, it is limited to the early phase of the pandemic, and purifying selection is much weaker in SARS-CoV-2 than in related bat Sarbecoviruses. In contrast, our analysis detects significant positive episodic diversifying selection acting on the bat virus lineage SARS-CoV-2 emerged from, accompanied by an adaptive depletion in CpG composition presumed to be linked to the action of antiviral mechanisms in ancestral hosts. The closest bat virus to SARS-CoV-2, RmYN02 (sharing an ancestor [~]1976), is a recombinant with a structure that includes differential CpG content in Spike; clear evidence of coinfection and evolution in bats without involvement of other species.

However, the enhancement of computational power, the demand for adaptable predictive frameworks, the short past of the disease, and uncertainties related to input data and prediction rules, also make other classical and machine learning techniques viable options.

OBJECTIVEThis study investigates the efficiency of six models in forecasting COVID-19 confirmed cases with 17 days ahead. We compare the models autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Holt-Winters, support vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbors regressor (KNN), random trees regressor (RTR), seasonal linear regression with change-points (Prophet), and simple logistic regression (SLR).

MATERIAL AND METHODSWe implement the models to data provided by the health surveillance secretary of Amapaa, a Brazilian state fully carved in the Amazon rainforest, which has been experiencing high infection rates. We evaluate the models according to their capacity to forecast in different historical scenarios of the COVID-19 progression, such as exponential increases, sudden decreases, and stability periods of daily cases. To do so, we use a rolling forward splitting approach for out-of-sample validation. We employ the metrics RMSE, R-squared, and sMAPE in evaluating the model in different cross-validation sections.

FINDINGSAll models outperform SLG, especially Holt-Winters, that performs satisfactorily in all scenarios. SVR and ARIMA have better performances in isolated scenarios. To implement the comparisons, we have created a web application, which is available online.

CONCLUSIONThis work represents an effort to assist the decision-makers of Amapa in future decisions to come, especially under scenarios of sudden variations in the number of confirmed cases of Amapa, which would be caused, for instance, by new contamination waves or vaccination.

Walrycin B (IC50 = 0.26 {micro}M), Hydroxocobalamin (IC50 = 3.29 {micro}M), Suramin sodium (IC50 = 6.5 {micro}M), Z-DEVD-FMK (IC50 = 6.81 {micro}M), LLL-12 (IC50 = 9.84 {micro}M), and Z-FA-FMK (IC50 = 11.39 {micro}M) are the most potent 3CLpro inhibitors. The activities of anti-SARS-CoV-2 viral infection was confirmed in 7 of 23 compounds using a SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay.

There is an urgent need to find therapeutic agents that can help clear the virus to prevent the severe disease and death. Identifying effective and safer drugs can provide with more options to treat the COVID-19 infections either alone or in combination. Here we performed a high throughput screen of approximately 1700 US FDA approved compounds to identify novel therapeutic agents that can effectively inhibit replication of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Our two-step screen first used a human coronavirus strain OC43 to identify compounds with anti-coronaviral activities. The effective compounds were then screened for their effectiveness in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. These screens have identified 24 anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs including previously reported compounds such as hydroxychloroquine, amlodipine, arbidol hydrochloride, tilorone 2HCl, dronedarone hydrochloride, and merfloquine hydrochloride. Five of the newly identified drugs had a safety index (cytotoxic/effective concentration) of &gt;600, indicating wide therapeutic window compared to hydroxychloroquine which had safety index of 22 in similar experiments. Mechanistically, five of the effective compounds were found to block SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell fusion. These FDA approved compounds can provide much needed therapeutic options that we urgently need in the midst of the pandemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",10.3389/fimmu.2020.586572,339,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.188953v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.188953v1.full.pdf

We also analyze structures for glycoforms representing those present in the nascent glycoproteins (prior to enzymatic modifications in the Golgi), as well as those that are commonly observed on antigens present in other viruses.

These models were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to determine the extent to which glycan microheterogeneity impacts the antigenicity of the S glycoprotein. Lastly, we have identified peptides in the S glycoprotein that are likely to be presented in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complexes, and discuss the role of S protein glycosylation in potentially modulating the adaptive immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or to a related vaccine.

The 3D structures show that the protein surface is extensively shielded from antibody recognition by glycans, with the exception of the ACE2 receptor binding domain, and also that the degree of shielding is largely insensitive to the specific glycoform. Despite the relatively modest contribution of the glycans to the total molecular weight (17% for the HEK293 glycoform) the level of surface shielding is disproportionately high at 42%.","NA",109,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.030445v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.030445v2.full.pdf

Current approaches rely on viral RNA detection, which cannot distinguish viral titer from RdRp activity. Precision Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq) is a nuclear run-on based nascent RNA sequencing method, widely used to map eukaryotic RNA polymerases by using labeled nucleotide analogues. Here we provide evidence that PRO-seq also detects RdRp activity and can serve as a highly sensitive RdRp mapping method.

Almeida,Federal University of Rio de Janeiro,2020-09-06,2,cc_by_nc_nd,Biophysics,"The N protein of betacoronaviruses is responsible for nucleocapsid assembly and other essential regulatory functions. Its N-terminal domain (NTD) interacts and melts the double-stranded transcriptional regulatory sequences (dsTRS), regulating the discontinuous subgenome transcription process. Here, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the binding of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD to non-specific (NS) and TRS dsRNAs. We probed dsRNAs Watson and Crick (WC) base-pairing over 25 replicas of 100 ns MD simulations, showing that only one N-NTD of dimeric N is enough to destabilize dsRNAs, initiating melting. N-NTD dsRNA destabilizing activity was more efficient for dsTRS than dsNS. N-NTD dynamics, especially a tweezer-like motion of {beta}2-{beta}3 and 2-{beta}5 loops, played a key role in WC base-pairing destabilization. Based on experimental information available in the literature, we constructed kinetics models for N-NTD-mediated dsRNA melting. Our results support a 1:1 stoichiometry (N-NTD:dsRNA), matching MD simulations and raising different possibilities for N-NTD action: (i) two N-NTDs of dimeric N would act independently, increasing efficiency; (ii) two N-NTDs of dimeric N would bind to two different RNA sites, bridging distant regions of the genome; and (iii) monomeric N would be active, opening up the possibility of a regulatory dissociation event.

IMPORTANCECoronaviruses are among the largest positive-sense RNA viruses. They display a unique discontinous transcription mechanism, involving N protein as a major player. The N-NTD promote the dsRNA melting releasing the nascent sense negative strand via a poorly known mechanism of action. It specifically recognizes the body TRS conserved RNA motif located at the 5 end of each ORF. N protein has the ability to transfer the nascent RNA strand to the leader TRS. The mechanism is essential and one single mutation at the RNA binding site of the N-NTD impairs the viral replication. Here, we describe a counterintuitive mechanism of action of N-NTD based on molecular dynamics simulation and kinetic modelling of the experimental melting activity of N-NTD. This data impacts directly in the understanding of the way N protein acts in the cell and will guide future experiments.","NA",65,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.264465v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.264465v2.full.pdf

Thanks to the scientific communitys unprecedented efforts, the atomic structure of several viral proteins has been promptly resolved. As the crucial mediator of host cell infection, the heavily glycosylated trimeric viral Spike protein (S) has been attracting the most attention and is at the center of efforts to develop antivirals, vaccines, and diagnostic solutions.

Herein, we use an energy-decomposition approach to identify antigenic domains and antibody binding sites on the fully glycosylated S protein. Crucially, all that is required by our method are unbiased atomistic molecular dynamics simulations; no prior knowledge of binding properties or ad hoc combinations of parameters/measures extracted from simulations is needed. Our method simply exploits the analysis of energy interactions between all intra-protomer aminoacid and monosaccharide residue pairs, and cross-compares them with structural information (i.e., residueresidue proximity), identifying potential immunogenic regions as those groups of spatially contiguous residues with poor energetic coupling to the rest of the protein.

Our results are validated by several experimentally confirmed structures of the S protein in complex with anti- or nanobodies. We identify poorly coupled sub-domains: on the one hand this indicates their role in hosting (several) epitopes, and on the other hand indicates their involvement in large functional conformational transitions. Finally, we detect two distinct behaviors of the glycan shield: glycans with stronger energetic coupling are structurally relevant and protect underlying peptidic epitopes; those with weaker coupling could themselves be poised for antibody recognition. Predicted Immunoreactive regions can be used to develop optimized antigens (recombinant subdomains, synthetic (glyco)peptidomimetics) for therapeutic applications.",10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c02341,539,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.214254v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.214254v1.full.pdf

Similar results were obtained for other human coronaviruses. Conversely, in the SARS-CoV-2 population, epitopes for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were not more variable than non-epitope positions. A significant reduction in epitope variability was instead observed for some of the most immunogenic proteins (S, N, ORF8, and ORF3a).

K.",Joanne Kramer Tobacman,University of Illinois at Chicago and Jesse Brown VAMC,2021-01-22,2,cc0,Biochemistry,"The precise mechanisms by which Covid-19 infection leads to hypoxia and respiratory failure have not yet been elucidated. Interactions between sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein have been identified as participating in viral adherence and infectivity. The spike glycoprotein binds to respiratory epithelium through the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which endogenously interacts with Angiotensin (Ang) II to yield Angiotensin 1-7. In this report, we show that stimulation of human vascular smooth muscle cells by Ang II leads to increased mRNA expression of two chondroitin sulfotransferases (CHST11 and CHST15), which are required for synthesis of chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) and chondroitin 4,6-disulfate (CSE), respectively. Also, increased total sulfated GAGs, increased sulfotransferase activity, and increased expression of the proteoglycans biglycan, syndecan, perlecan, and versican followed treatment by Ang II. Candesartan, an Angiotensin II receptor blocker (Arb), largely, but incompletely, inhibited these increases, and the differences from baseline remained significant. These results suggest that another effect of Ang II also contributes to the increased expression of chondroitin sulfotransferases, total sulfated GAGs, and proteoglycans. We hypothesize that activation of ACE2 may contribute to these increases and suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein interaction with ACE2 may also increase chondroitin sulfotransferases, sulfated GAGs, and proteoglycans and thereby contribute to viral adherence to bronchioalveolar cells and to respiratory compromise in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","NA",21,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.171975v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.171975v2.full.pdf

We initially demonstrated the dual inhibition profile of Montelukast through multiscale molecular modeling studies. Next, we characterized its effect on both targets by different in vitro experiments including the Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based main protease enzyme inhibition assay, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, pseudovirus neutralization on HEK293T / hACE2, and virus neutralization assay using xCELLigence MP real time cell analyzer. Our integrated in silico and in vitro results confirmed the dual potential effect of the Montelukast both on virus entry into the host cell (Spike/ACE2) and on the main protease enzyme inhibition. The virus neutralization assay results showed that while no cytotoxicity of the Montelukast was observed at 12 M concentration, the cell index time 50 (CIT50) value was delayed for 12 hours.

Information about the spread of the virus in a country can inform the gradual reopening of a country and help to avoid a second wave of infections. Denmark is currently opening up after a lockdown in mid-March.Methods We perform a phylogenetic analysis of 742 publicly available Danish SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and put them into context using sequences from other countries.Result Our findings are consistent with several introductions of the virus to Denmark from independent sources. We identify several chains of mutations that occurred in Denmark and in at least one case find evidence that the virus spread from Denmark to other countries. A number of the mutations found in Denmark are non-synonymous, and in general there is a considerable variety of strains. The proportions of the most common haplotypes is stable after lockdown.Conclusion Our work shows how genetic data can be used to identify routes of introduction of a virus into a region and provide alternative means for verifying existing assumptions. For example, our analysis supports the hypothesis that the virus was brought to Denmark by skiers returning from Ischgl. On the other hand, we identify transmission chains suggesting that Denmark was part of a network of countries among which the virus was being transmitted; thus challenging the common narrative that Denmark only got infected from abroad. Our analysis does not indicate that the major haplotypes appearing in Denmark have a different degree of virality. Our methods can be applied to other countries, regions or even highly localised outbreaks. When used in real-time, we believe they can serve to identify transmission events and supplement traditional methods such as contact tracing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",10.1371/journal.pone.0241405,60,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.29.123612v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.29.123612v2.full.pdf

Rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit disease pathobiology similar to human COVID-19, thus serving as a relevant animal model. In the current study, we have characterized the transcriptional signatures induced in the lungs of juvenile and old rhesus macaques following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show that genes associated with Interferon (IFN) signaling, neutrophil degranulation and innate immune pathways are significantly induced in macaque infected lungs, while pathways associated with collagen formation are downregulated. In COVID-19, increasing age is a significant risk factor for poor prognosis and increased mortality. We demonstrate that Type I IFN and Notch signaling pathways are significantly upregulated in lungs of juvenile infected macaques when compared with old infected macaques. These results are corroborated with increased peripheral neutrophil counts and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio in older individuals with COVID-19 disease. In contrast, pathways involving VEGF are downregulated in lungs of old infected macaques. Using samples from humans with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, we validate a subset of our findings. Finally, neutrophil degranulation, innate immune system and IFN gamma signaling pathways are upregulated in both tuberculosis and COVID-19, two pulmonary diseases where neutrophils are associated with increased severity.

To study the dynamic motion of glycans in the spike protein, we performed microsecond-long MD simulation in two different states that correspond to the receptor binding domain in open or closed conformations. Analysis of this microsecond-long simulation revealed a scissoring motion on the N-terminal domain of neighboring monomers in the spike trimer. Role of multiple glycans in shielding of spike protein in different regions were uncovered by a network analysis, where the high betweenness centrality of glycans at the apex revealed their importance and function in the glycan shield. Microdomains of glycans were identified featuring a high degree of intra-communication in these microdomains.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, due to its primary interaction with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell-surface receptor, is considered as a potential target for drug development. Based on in silico screening followed by in vitro studies, here we report that the existing FDA-approved Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 of 130 nM. We provide evidence that although imatinib binds to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with an affinity at micromolar, i.e., 2.32 {+/-} 0.9 M levels, imatinib does not directly inhibit the spike RBD:ACE2 interaction - suggesting a Bcr-Abl kinase-mediated fusion inhibition mechanism is responsible for the inhibitory action.

Based on promising in vitro results, we propose the Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ATKI), imatinib, to be a viable repurposable drug against COVID-19.","NA",86,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.18.158196v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.18.158196v2.full.pdf

Systemic vaccination by this vector in mice, in which the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor hACE2 has been induced by transduction of respiratory tract cells by an adenoviral vector, conferred only partial protection, despite an intense serum neutralizing activity. However, targeting the immune response to the respiratory tract through an intranasal boost with this LV resulted in > 3 log10 decrease in the lung viral loads and avoided local inflammation. Moreover, both integrative and non-integrative LV platforms displayed a strong vaccine efficacy and inhibited lung deleterious injury in golden hamsters, which are naturally permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication and restitute the human COVID-19 physiopathology. Our results provide evidence of marked prophylactic effects of the LV-based vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and designate the intranasal immunization as a powerful approach against COVID-19.

Importantly, many viral-host protein interactions take place at intracellular membranes and poorly soluble organelles, which are difficult to profile using classical biochemical purification approaches. Applying proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) with the fast-acting miniTurbo enzyme to 27 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549), we detected 7810 proximity interactions (7382 of which are new for SARS-CoV-2) with 2242 host proteins (results available at covid19interactome.org). These results complement and dramatically expand upon recent affinity purification-based studies identifying stable host-virus protein complexes, and offer an unparalleled view of membrane-associated processes critical for viral production. Host cell organellar markers were also subjected to BioID in parallel, allowing us to propose modes of action for several viral proteins in the context of host proteome remodelling.

However, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP during the outbreak remain unclear.

ObjectivesWe aimed to estimate the basic and time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP across China, and compared them with SARS.

MethodsData on NCP cases by February 7, 2020 were collected from epidemiological investigations or official websites. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in Guangdong Province, Beijing and Hong Kong during 2002-2003 were also obtained. We estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (R0) and time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of NCP and SARS.

Measurements and main resultsAs of February 7, 2020, 34,598 NCP cases were identified in China, and daily confirmed cases decreased after February 4. The doubling time of NCP nationwide was 2.4 days which was shorter than that of SARS in Guangdong (14.3 days), Hong Kong (5.7 days) and Beijing (12.4 days). The R0 of NCP cases nationwide and in Wuhan were 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, which were higher than R0 of SARS in Guangdong (R0=2.3), Hongkong (R0=2.3), and Beijing (R0=2.6). The Rt for NCP continuously decreased especially after January 16 nationwide and in Wuhan. The R0 for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong was 0.6, and the Rt values were less than 1 during the epidemic.

ConclusionsNCP may have a higher transmissibility than SARS, and the efforts of containing the outbreak are effective. However, the efforts are needed to persist in for reducing time-varying reproduction number below one.

At a Glance CommentaryO_ST_ABSScientific Knowledge on the SubjectC_ST_ABSSince December 29, 2019, pneumonia infection with 2019-nCoV, now named as Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP), occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas. As a novel virus, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP remain unclear, and it is also important to compare it with SARS.

What This Study Adds to the FieldWe compared the transmission dynamics of NCP with SARS, and found that NCP has a higher transmissibility than SARS. Time-varying production number indicates that rigorous control measures taken by governments are effective across China, and persistent efforts are needed to be taken for reducing instantaneous reproduction number below one.","NA",96,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.25.919787v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.25.919787v2.full.pdf

Utilizing CoPIC screening, we mapped the interaction network among RTC-related viral proteins. We identified a total of 47 binary interactions among 14 proteins governing replication, discontinuous transcription, and translation of coronaviruses. Further exploration via CoPIC led to the discovery of extensive ternary complexes composed of these components, which infer potential higher-order complexes.

SARS-CoV-2 triggers severe pneumonia, which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in severe cases. As reported, SARS-CoV-2 is 80% genetically identical to the 2003 SARS-CoV virus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the main receptor for entry of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. ACE2 is normally expressed in cardiovascular and lung type II alveolar epithelial cells, where it positively modulates the RAS system that regulates blood flow, pressure, and fluid homeostasis. Thus, virus-induced reduction of ACE2 gene expression is considered to make a significant contribution to severe acute respiratory failure. Chromatin remodeling plays a significant role in the regulation of ACE2 gene expression and the activity of regulatory elements within the genome.

MethodsHere, we integrated data on physical chromatin interactions within the genome organization (captured by Hi-C) with tissue-specific gene expression data to identify spatial expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and thus regulatory elements located within the ACE2 gene.

ResultsWe identified regulatory elements within ACE2 that control the expression of PIR, CA5B, and VPS13C in the lung. The gene products of these genes are involved in inflammatory responses, de novo pyrimidine and polyamine synthesis, and the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively.

ConclusionOur study, although limited by the fact that the identification of the regulatory interactions is putative until proven by targeted experiments, supports the hypothesis that viral silencing of ACE2 alters the activity of gene regulatory regions and promotes an intra-cellular environment suitable for viral replication.","NA",117,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.042002v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.042002v2.full.pdf

In several purchased in-house primers/probe sets, quantification cycle values as low as 17 were measured for negative control samples. However, there were also primers/probe sets that displayed very low-level contaminations, which were detected only during thorough internal validation.

Several efforts to control SARS-CoV-2 dissemination are still running including vaccines and drug treatments. The effectiveness of these procedures depends, in part, that the regions to which these treatments are directed do not vary considerably. Although, it is known that the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is relatively low it is necessary to monitor the adaptation and evolution of the virus in the different stages of the pandemic. Thus, identification, analysis of the dynamics, and possible functional and structural implication of mutations are relevant. Here, we first estimate the number of COVID-19 cases with a virus with a specific mutation and then calculate its global relative frequency (NRFp). Using this approach in a dataset of 100 924 genomes from GISAID, we identified 41 mutations to be present in viruses in an estimated number of 750 000 global COVID-19 cases (0.03 NRFp). We classified these mutations into three groups: high-frequent, low-frequent non-synonymous, and low-frequent synonymous. Analysis of the dynamics of these mutations by month and continent showed that high-frequent mutations appeared early in the pandemic, all are present in all continents and some of them are almost fixed in the global population. On the other hand, low-frequent mutations (non-synonymous and synonymous) appear late in the pandemic and seems to be at least partially continent-specific. This could be due to that high-frequent mutation appeared early when lockdown policies had not yet been applied and low-frequent mutations appeared after lockdown policies. Thus, preventing global dissemination of them.

We wondered if the myeloid compartment was affected in Covid-19 and if monocytes and macrophages could be infected by SARS-CoV-2. We show here that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infects monocytes and macrophages without any cytopathic effect. Infection was associated with the secretion of immunoregulatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, TGF-{beta}) and the induction of a macrophagic specific transcriptional program characterized by the upregulation of M2-type molecules. In addition, we found that in vitro macrophage polarization did not account for the permissivity to SARS-CoV-2, since M1-and M2-type macrophages were similarly infected. Finally, in a cohort of 76 Covid-19 patients ranging from mild to severe clinical expression, all circulating monocyte subsets were decreased, likely related to massive emigration into tissues.

For development of preclinical countermeasures, reliable and well-characterized small animal disease models will be of paramount importance. Here we show that intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 into Syrian hamsters consistently caused moderate broncho-interstitial pneumonia, with high viral lung loads and extensive virus shedding, but animals only displayed transient mild disease. We determined the infectious dose 50 to be only five infectious particles, making the Syrian hamster a highly susceptible model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neither hamster age nor sex had any impact on the severity of disease or course of infection. Finally, prolonged viral persistence in interleukin 2 receptor gamma chain knockout hamsters revealed susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to adaptive immune control. In conclusion, the Syrian hamster is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 making it a very suitable infection model for COVID-19 countermeasure development.

Several animal models have been rapidly developed that recapitulate the asymptomatic to moderate disease spectrum. Now, there is a direct need for additional small animal models to study the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and for fast-tracked medical countermeasure development. Here, we show that transgenic mice expressing the human SARS-CoV-2 receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]) under a cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18) are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that infection resulted in a dose-dependent lethal disease course. After inoculation with either 104 TCID50 or 105 TCID50, the SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in rapid weight loss in both groups and uniform lethality in the 105 TCID50 group. High levels of viral RNA shedding were observed from the upper and lower respiratory tract and intermittent shedding was observed from the intestinal tract. Inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in upper and lower respiratory tract infection with high infectious virus titers in nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs. The observed interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary pathology, with SARS-CoV-2 replication evident in pneumocytes, were similar to that reported in severe cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and upregulation of Th1 and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Extrapulmonary replication of SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of several animals at 7 DPI but not at 3 DPI. The rapid inflammatory response and observed pathology bears resemblance to COVID-19. Taken together, this suggests that this mouse model can be useful for studies of pathogenesis and medical countermeasure development.

Authors SummaryThe disease manifestation of COVID-19 in humans range from asymptomatic to severe. While several mild to moderate disease models have been developed, there is still a need for animal models that recapitulate the severe and fatal progression observed in a subset of patients. Here, we show that humanized transgenic mice developed dose-dependent disease when inoculated with SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. The mice developed upper and lower respiratory tract infection, with virus replication also in the brain after day 3 post inoculation. The pathological and immunological diseases manifestation observed in these mice bears resemblance to human COVID-19, suggesting increased usefulness of this model for elucidating COVID-19 pathogenesis further and testing of countermeasures, both of which are urgently needed.",10.1371/journal.ppat.1009195,322,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.246314v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.246314v1.full.pdf

The knowledge of the 3D structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins can facilitate the development of therapeutic and diagnostic molecules. Specifically, comparative analyses of the structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and homologous proteins from previously characterized viruses, such as SARS-CoV, can reveal the common and/or distinctive traits that underlie the mechanisms of recognition of cell receptors and of molecules of the immune system.

Herein, we apply our recently developed energy-based methods for the prediction of antibody-binding epitopes and protein-protein interaction regions to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Our analysis focusses only on the study of the structure of RBDs in isolation, without making use of any previous knowledge of binding properties. Importantly, our results highlight structural and sequence differences among the regions that are predicted to be immunoreactive and bind/elicit antibodies. These results provide a rational basis to the observation that several SARS-CoV RDB-specific monoclonal antibodies fail to appreciably bind the SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. Furthermore, we correctly identify the region of SARS-CoV-2 RBD that is engaged by the cell receptor ACE2 during viral entry into host cells.

The data, sequences and structures we present here can be useful for the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic interventions.","NA",66,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.990267v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.990267v2.full.pdf

Using an infectious molecular clone of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that expresses eGFP as a marker of infection, we replaced the glycoprotein gene (G) with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2) and developed a high-throughput imaging-based neutralization assay at biosafety level 2.

The virus spike glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins are the main targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, to control the disease spread. We herein study the structural order-disorder propensity and the rates of evolution of these two proteins to characterize their B cell and T cell epitopes, previously suggested to contribute to immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections. We first analyzed the rates of evolution along the sequences of spike and nucleocapsid proteins in relation to the spatial locations of their epitopes. For this purpose, we compared orthologs from seven human coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. We then focus on the local, structural order-disorder propensities of the protein regions where the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes are located. We show that the vast majority of nucleocapsid protein epitopes overlap the RNA-binding and dimerization domains and some of them are characterized by low rates of evolutions. Similarly, spike protein epitopes are preferentially located in regions that are predicted to be ordered and well-conserved, in correspondence of the heptad repeats 1 and 2. Interestingly, both the receptor-binding motif to ACE2 and the fusion peptide of spike protein are characterized by high rates of evolution, probably to overcome host immunity.

Stochasticity in transmission within and between countries and/or actual advantage in virus transmissibility could explain the high frequency reached by some genomic variants during the course of the outbreak.

Using a suite of statistical, population genetics, and theoretical approaches, we show that the globally most represented spike protein variant (i.e., the G clade, A [-&gt;] G nucleotide change at genomic position 23,403; D [-&gt;] G amino acid change at spike protein position 614) i) underwent a significant demographic expansion in most countries not explained by stochastic effects or enhanced pathogenicity; ii) affects the spike S1/S2 furin-like site increasing its conformational plasticity (short range effect), and iii) modifies the internal motion of the receptor-binding domain affecting its cross-connection with other functional domains (long-range effect).

Our study unambiguously links the spread of the G614 with a non-random process, and we hypothesize that this process is related to the selective advantage produced by a specific structural modification of the spike protein. We conclude that the different conformation of the S1/S2 proteolytic site is at the basis of the higher transmission rate of this invasive SARS-CoV-2 variant, and provide structural information to guide the design of selective and efficient drugs.","NA",498,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.14.095620v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.14.095620v1.full.pdf

Its main protease (Mpro), which functions as a dimer, cleaves viral precursor proteins in the process of viral maturation. It is a good candidate for drug development owing to its conservation and the absence of a human homolog. An improved understanding of the protein behaviour can accelerate the discovery of effective therapies in order to reduce mortality. 100 ns all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of 50 homology modelled mutant Mpro dimers were performed at pH 7 from filtered sequences obtained from the GISAID database. Protease dynamics were analysed using RMSD, RMSF, Rg, the averaged betweenness centrality and geometry calculations. Domains from each Mpro protomer were found to generally have independent motions, while the dimer-stabilising N-finger region was found to be flexible in most mutants. A mirrored interprotomer pocket was found to be correlated to the catalytic site using compaction dynamics, and can be a potential allosteric target. The high number of titratable amino acids of Mpro may indicate an important role of pH on enzyme dynamics, as previously reported for SARS-CoV.

Here by analyzing the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of COVID-19 patients through single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq), we found that in severe (or critical) cases, there is remarkable expansion of TM4SF1+ and KRT5+ lung progenitor cells. The two distinct populations of progenitor cells could play crucial roles in alveolar cell regeneration and epithelial barrier re-establishment, respectively. In order to understand the function of KRT5+ progenitors in vivo, we transplanted a single KRT5+ cell-derived cell population into damaged mouse lung. Time-course single-cell transcriptomic analysis showed that the transplanted KRT5+ progenitors could long-term engrafted into host lung and differentiate into HOPX+ OCLN+ alveolar barrier cell which restored the epithelial barrier and efficiently prevented inflammatory cell infiltration. Similar barrier cells were also identified in some COVID-19 patients with massive leukocyte infiltration.

However, little is known about the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-21-5. Here we report on 149 COVID-19 convalescent individuals.

Antibody cloning revealed expanded clones of RBD-specific memory B cells expressing closely related antibodies in different individuals. Despite low plasma titers, antibodies to three distinct epitopes on RBD neutralized at half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) as low as single digit ng/mL. Thus, most convalescent plasmas obtained from individuals who recover from COVID-19 do not contain high levels of neutralizing activity.

This human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus carrying 30 kilobase of single positive-sense RNA genome. Understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts. The present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-nCoV genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. This nCoV genotype might have been evolved from a bat-CoV by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-nCoV during evolution. Interestingly, 2019-nCoV Spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide sequence insertion relative to SARS-like bat-SL-CoVZC45/2017. Furthermore, we identified eight high binding affinity (HBA) CD4 T-cell epitopes in the S, E, M and N proteins, which can be commonly recognized by HLA-DR alleles of Asia and Asia-Pacific Region population. These immunodominant epitopes can be incorporated in universal subunit CoV vaccine. Diverse HLA types and variations in the epitope binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus in humans.

Activation of the Jak-Stat pathway by Interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-/{beta}) in lung epithelial cells is critical for innate immunity to respiratory viruses. Genetic and biochemical studies have shown that transcriptional regulation by IFN-/{beta} required the formation of Interferon-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF-3) complex consisting of Stat1, Stat2, and Irf9 transcription factors. Furthermore, IFN /{beta} receptor activates multiple signal transduction pathways in parallel to the Jak-Stat pathway and induces several transcription factors at mRNA levels resulting in the secondary and tertiary rounds of transcription. Transcriptional factor profiling in the transcriptome and RNA analysis revealed that Early growth response-1 (Egr-1) was rapidly induced by IFN-/{beta} and Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands in multiple cell types. Studies in mutant cell lines lacking components of the ISGF-3 complex revealed that IFN-{beta} induction of Egr-1 was independent of Stat1, Stat2, or Irf9. Activation of the Mek/Erk-1/2 pathway was implicated in the rapid induction of Egr-1 by IFN-{beta} in serum-starved mouse lung epithelial cells. Interrogation of multiple microarray datasets revealed that respiratory viruses including coronaviruses regulated Egr-1 expression in human lung cell lines. Furthermore, Egr-1 inducible genes including transcription factors, mediators of cell growth, and chemokines were differentially regulated in the human lung cell lines after coronavirus infection, and in the lung biopsies of COVID-19 patients.

Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug with in vitro and in vivo efficacy against coronaviruses. Here, we tested the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsTo evaluate the effect of remdesivir treatment on SARS-CoV-2 disease outcome, we used the recently established rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection that results in transient lower respiratory tract disease. Two groups of six rhesus macaques were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with intravenous remdesivir or an equal volume of vehicle solution once daily. Clinical, virological and histological parameters were assessed regularly during the study and at necropsy to determine treatment efficacy.

ResultsIn contrast to vehicle-treated animals, animals treated with remdesivir did not show signs of respiratory disease and had reduced pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs. Virus titers in bronchoalveolar lavages were significantly reduced as early as 12hrs after the first treatment was administered. At necropsy on day 7 after inoculation, lung viral loads of remdesivir-treated animals were significantly lower and there was a clear reduction in damage to the lung tissue.

ConclusionsTherapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated early during infection has a clear clinical benefit in SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques.

The translation of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome for most open reading frames (ORFs) occurs via RNA intermediates termed ""sub-genomic RNAs"". sgRNAs are produced through discontinuous transcription which relies on homology between transcription regulatory sequences (TRS-B) upstream of the ORF start codons and that of the TRS-L which is located in the 5 UTR. TRS-L is immediately preceded by a leader sequence. This leader sequence is therefore found at the 5 end of all sgRNA. We applied periscope to 1,155 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Sheffield, UK and validated our findings using orthogonal datasets and in vitro cell systems. Using a simple local alignment to detect reads which contain the leader sequence we were able to identify and quantify reads arising from canonical and non-canonical sgRNA. We were able to detect all canonical sgRNAs at expected abundances, with the exception of ORF10. A number of recurrent non-canonical sgRNAs are detected. We show that the results are reproducible using technical replicates and determine the optimum number of reads for sgRNA analysis. In VeroE6 ACE2+/- cell lines, periscope can detect the changes in the kinetics of sgRNA in orthogonal sequencing datasets. Finally, variants found in genomic RNA are transmitted to sgRNAs with high fidelity in most cases. This tool can be applied to all sequenced COVID-19 samples worldwide to provide comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sgRNA.","NA",35,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.01.181867v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.01.181867v2.full.pdf

The trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein interacts with its receptor human ACE2 to mediate viral entry into host-cells. Here we present cryo-EM structures of an uncharacterized tightly closed SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer and the ACE2-bound-S-trimer at 2.7-Å and 3.8-Å-resolution, respectively. The tightly closed S-trimer with inactivated fusion peptide may represent the ground prefusion state. ACE2 binding to the up receptor-binding domain (RBD) within S-trimer triggers continuous swing-motions of ACE2-RBD, resulting in conformational dynamics of S1 subunits. Noteworthy, SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer appears much more sensitive to ACE2-receptor than SARS-CoV S-trimer in terms of receptor-triggered transformation from the closed prefusion state to the fusion-prone open state, potentially contributing to the superior infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. We defined the RBD T470-T478 loop and residue Y505 as viral determinants for specific recognition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD by ACE2, and provided structural basis of the spike D614G-mutation induced enhanced infectivity. Our findings offer a thorough picture on the mechanism of ACE2-induced conformational transitions of S-trimer from ground prefusion state towards postfusion state, thereby providing important information for development of vaccines and therapeutics aimed to block receptor binding.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",10.1126/sciadv.abe5575,492,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.177097v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.177097v1.full.pdf

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is related to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which have caused the previous outbreaks. The papain-like protease (PLpro) is an attractive drug target due to its essential roles in the viral life cycle. As a cysteine protease, PLpro is rich in cysteines and histidines and their protonation/deprotonation modulates catalysis and conformational plasticity. Here we report the pKa calculations and assessment of the proton-coupled conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PLpros using a newly developed GPU-accelerated implicit-solvent continuous constant pH molecular dynamics method with an asynchronous replica-exchange scheme. The calculated pKa’s support the catalytic roles of the Cys-His-Asp triad. We also found that several residues can switch protonation states at physiological pH, among which is C270/271 located on the flexible blocking loop 2 (BL2) of SARS-CoV-2/CoV PLpro. Simulations revealed that the BL2 conformational dynamics is coupled to the titration of C271/270, in agreement with the crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. Simulations also revealed that BL2 in MERS-CoV PLpro is very flexible, sampling both open and closed states despite the lack of an analogous cysteine.

Although vaccines exist against circulating influenza A viruses, such vaccines are ineffective against emerging pandemic influenza A viruses. Currently, no vaccine exists against coronavirus infections, including pandemic SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To combat these RNA virus infections, alternative antiviral strategies are needed. A key drug target is the viral RNA polymerase, which is responsible for viral RNA synthesis. In January 2020, the World Health Organisation identified enisamium as a candidate therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2. Enisamium is an isonicotinic acid derivative that is an inhibitor of multiple influenza B and A virus strains in cell culture and clinically approved in 11 countries. Here we show using in vitro assays that enisamium and its putative metabolite, VR17-04, inhibit the activity of the influenza virus and the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase. VR17-04 displays similar efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase as the nucleotide analogue remdesivir triphosphate. These results suggest that enisamium is a broad-spectrum small molecule inhibitor of RNA virus RNA synthesis, and implicate it as a possible therapeutic option for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unlike remdesivir, enisamium does not require intravenous administration which may be advantageous for the development of COVID-19 treatments outside a hospital setting.

Here, we investigated the molecular, phylogenomic, and evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in western India, the most affected region of the country. A total of 90 genomes were sequenced. Four nucleotide variants, namely C241T, C3037T, C14408T (Pro4715Leu), and A23403G (Asp614Gly), located at 5UTR, Orf1a, Orf1b, and Spike protein regions of the genome, respectively, were predominant and ubiquitous (90%).

The major cluster (cluster 4) is distinguished by mutations C313T, C5700A, G28881A are unique patterns and observed in 45% of samples. We thus report a newly emerging pattern of linked mutations. The predominance of these linked mutations suggests that they are likely a part of the viral fitness landscape. A novel and distinct pattern of mutations in the viral strains of each of the districts was observed. The Satara district viral strains showed mutations primarily at the 3' end of the genome, while Nashik district viral strains displayed mutations at the 5' end of the genome. Characterization of Pune strains showed that a novel variant has overtaken the other strains. Examination of the frequency of three mutations i.e., C313T, C5700A, G28881A in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients indicated an increased occurrence in symptomatic cases, which is more prominent in females. The age-wise specific pattern of mutation is observed. Mutations C18877T, G20326A, G24794T, G25563T, G26152T, and C26735T are found in more than 30% study samples in the age group of 10-25.

Structural comparation of S-proteins indicated their similarity and distributions of N-glycosylation sites. Further potential sialic acid or galactose affinity domains have been described in the S-protein by docking analysis. Molecular dynamic simulation for the glycosylated complexus of S-protein-ACE2 implied that the complicate viral binding of receptor-binding domain may be influenced by peripheric N-glycans from own and adjacent monoers. These works will contribute to investigate the N-glycosylation in S-protein and explain the highly contagious of COVID-19.",NA,278,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.01.406025v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.01.406025v1.full.pdf

Numerous promising therapeutic and vaccine research efforts to mitigate the catastrophic effects of COVID-19 pandemic are underway, yet an efficacious countermeasure is still not available. To support these global research efforts, we have used a novel computational pipeline combining machine learning, bioinformatics, and supercomputing to predict antibody structures capable of targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). In 22 days, using just the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and previously published neutralizing antibody structures for SARS-CoV-1, we generated 20 initial antibody sequences predicted to target the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. As a first step in this process, we predicted (and publicly released) structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using homology-based structural modeling. The predicted structures proved to be accurate within the targeted RBD region when compared to experimentally derived structures published weeks later. Next we used our in silico design platform to iteratively propose mutations to SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies (known not to bind SARS-Cov-2) to enable and optimize binding within the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Starting from a calculated baseline free energy of -48.1 kcal/mol ({+/-} 8.3), our 20 selected first round antibody structures are predicted to have improved interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with free energies as low as -82.0 kcal/mole. The baseline SARS-CoV-1 antibody in complex with the SARS-CoV-1 RBD has a calculated interaction energy of -52.2 kcal/mole and neutralizes the virus by preventing it from binding and entering the human ACE2 receptor. These results suggest that our predicted antibody mutants may bind the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and potentially neutralize the virus. Additionally, our selected antibody mutants score well according to multiple antibody developability metrics. These antibody designs are being expressed and experimentally tested for binding to COVID-19 viral proteins, which will provide invaluable feedback to further improve the machine learning-driven designs. This technical report is a high-level description of that effort; the Supplementary Materials includes the homology-based structural models we developed and 178,856 in silico free energy calculations for 89,263 mutant antibodies derived from known SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies.","NA",400,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.024885v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.024885v1.full.pdf

The bifunctional nsp14 contains an N-terminal 3-to-5 exoribonuclease (ExoN) and a C-terminal N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domain. While the latter presumably operates during viral mRNA capping, ExoN is thought to mediate proofreading during genome replication. In line with such a role, ExoN-knockout mutants of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were previously found to have a crippled but viable hypermutation phenotype. Remarkably, using an identical reverse genetics approach, an extensive mutagenesis study revealed the corresponding ExoN-knockout mutants of another betacoronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), to be non-viable. This is in agreement with observations previously made for alpha- and gammacoronaviruses. Only a single MERS-CoV ExoN active site mutant could be recovered, likely because the introduced D191E substitution is highly conservative in nature. For 11 other MERS-CoV ExoN active site mutants, not a trace of RNA synthesis could be detected, unless - in some cases - reversion had first occurred. Subsequently, we expressed and purified recombinant MERS-CoV nsp14 and established in vitro assays for both its ExoN and N7-MTase activities. All ExoN knockout mutations that were lethal when tested via reverse genetics were found to severely decrease ExoN activity, while not affecting N7-MTase activity. Our study thus reveals an additional function for MERS-CoV nsp14 ExoN, which apparently is critical for primary viral RNA synthesis, thus differentiating it from the proofreading activity thought to boost long-term replication fidelity in MHV and SARS-CoV.

For the betacoronaviruses MHV and SARS-CoV, the ExoN domain was reported to promote the fidelity of genome replication, presumably by mediating some form of proofreading. For these viruses, ExoN knockout mutants are alive while displaying an increased mutation frequency. Strikingly, we now established that the equivalent knockout mutants of MERS-CoV ExoN are non-viable and completely deficient in RNA synthesis, thus revealing an additional and more critical function of ExoN in coronavirus replication. Both enzymatic activities of (recombinant) MERS-CoV nsp14 were evaluated using newly developed in vitro assays that can be used to characterize these key replicative enzymes in more detail and explore their potential as target for antiviral drug development.",10.1128/JVI.01246-20,605,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.19.162529v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.19.162529v1.full.pdf

This virus contains spike proteins on its envelope that binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) expressed on the surface of airway cells, enabling entry of the virus for causing infection1,2. In severe cases, the virus enters the circulatory system, contributing to multiorgan failure. Soluble form of hACE2 binds to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and prevents viral entry into target cells3. Moreover, soluble recombinant ACE2 ameliorates lung injury4 but its short half-life limits its therapeutic utility5. Here, we engineered synthetic mRNA to encode a soluble form of hACE2 (hsACE2) to prevent viral infection. Novel lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were used to package mRNA and transfect mammalian cells for enhanced production of secreted proteins. Intravenously administered LNP led to hepatic delivery of the mRNA. This elicited secretion of hsACE2 into the blood circulation within 2 h, and levels of circulating hsACE2 peaked at 6 h and gradually decreased over several days. Since the primary site of entry and pathogenesis for SARS-CoV-2 is the lungs, we instilled LNPs into the lungs and were able to detect hsACE2 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid within 24 h and lasted for 48 h. Through co-immunoprecipitation, we found that mRNA-generated hsACE2 was able to bind with the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Furthermore, hsACE2 was able to strongly inhibit (over 90%) SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection.

In this work we utilize molecular dynamics simulations to probe the flexibility and conformational ensemble of the unbound state of the receptor-binding domain from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We have found that the unbound RBD has a localized region of dynamic flexibility in Loop 3 and that mutations identified during the COVID-19 pandemic in Loop 3 do not affect this flexibility. We use a loop-modeling protocol to generate and simulate novel conformations of the CoV2-RBD Loop 3 region that sample conformational space beyond the ACE2 bound crystal structure.

NSP3 and NSP5 of SARS-CoV (SARS1) are known interferon antagonists. Here, we examined whether the protease function of SARS2 NSP3 and NSP5 target proteins involved in the host innate immune response. We designed a fluorescent based cleavage assay to rapidly screen the protease activity of NSP3 and NSP5 on a library of 71 human innate immune proteins (HIIPs), covering most pathways involved in human innate immunity. By expressing each of these HIIPs with a genetically encoded fluorophore in a cell-free system and titrating in the recombinant protease domain of NSP3 or NSP5, we could readily detect cleavage of cognate HIIPs on SDS-page gels. We identified 3 proteins that were specifically and selectively cleaved by NSP3 or NSP5: IRF-3, and NLRP12 and TAB1, respectively. Direct cleavage of IRF3 by NSP3 could explain the blunted Type- I IFN response seen during SARS-CoV-2 infections while NSP5 mediated cleavage of NLRP12 and TAB1 point to a molecular mechanism for enhanced production of IL-6 and inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients. Surprisingly, both NLRP12 and TAB1 have each two distinct cleavage sites. We demonstrate that in mice, the second cleavage site of NLRP12 is absent. We pushed this comparative alignment of IRF-3 and NLRP12 homologs and show that the lack or presence of cognate cleavage motifs in IRF-3 and NLRP12 could contribute to the presentation of disease in cats and tigers, for example. Our findings provide an explanatory framework for in-depth studies into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and should facilitate the search or development of more effective animal models for severe COVID-19. Finally, we discovered that one particular species of bats, Davids Myotis, possesses the five cleavage sites found in humans for NLRP12, TAB1 and IRF3.

We established two distinct ethanolamine transport systems of a high affinity (K1 = 55.6 - 66.5 M), mediated by CTL1, and of a low affinity (K2 = 275 - 299 M), mediated by CTL2. Both types of transport are Na+-independent and mediated in a pH dependent manner, as expected for ethanolamine/H+ antiporters. Primary human fibroblasts with separate frameshift mutations (M1= SLC44A1 {Delta}Asp517 and M2= SLC44A1 {Delta}Ser126) are devoid of CTL1 ethanolamine transport but maintain unaffected CTL2 transport. The lack of CTL1 or CTL2 reduced the ethanolamine transport, the flux by the CDP-ethanolamine Kennedy pathway and PE synthesis. Overexpression of CTL1 in SLC44A1 {Delta}Ser126 (M2) cells improved the ethanolamine transport and PE synthesis. The SLC44A1 {Delta}Ser126 cells are reliant on CTL2 function and CTL2 siRNA almost completely abolished ethanolamine transport in the whole cells and mitochondria. Overexpression of CTL1 and CTL2 cDNAs increased ethanolamine transport in control and SLC44A1{Delta}Ser126 cells. CTL1 and CTL2 facilitated mitochondrial ethanolamine uptake, but the transport mediated by CTL1 is predominant in the whole cells and mitochondria. These data firmly established that CTL1 and CTL2 are the first identified ethanolamine transporters in the whole cells and mitochondria, with intrinsic roles in de novo PE synthesis by the CDP-Etn Kennedy pathway and compartmentation of intracellular ethanolamine.

To date, no targeted treatment is available for this syndrome, likely due to substantial patient heterogeneity2,3 and our lack of insight into sepsis immunopathology4. These issues are highlighted by the current COVID-19 pandemic, wherein many clinical manifestations of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection parallel bacterial sepsis5-8. We previously reported an expanded CD14+ monocyte state, MS1, in patients with bacterial sepsis or non-infectious critical illness, and validated its expansion in sepsis across thousands of patients using public transcriptomic data9. Despite its marked expansion in the circulation of bacterial sepsis patients, its relevance to viral sepsis and association with disease outcomes have not been examined. In addition, the ontogeny and function of this monocyte state remain poorly characterized. Using public transcriptomic data, we show that the expression of the MS1 program is associated with sepsis mortality and is up-regulated in monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19. We found that blood plasma from bacterial sepsis or COVID-19 patients with severe disease induces emergency myelopoiesis and expression of the MS1 program, which are dependent on the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10. Finally, we demonstrate that MS1 cells are broadly immunosuppressive, similar to monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and have decreased responsiveness to stimulation. Our findings highlight the utility of regulatory myeloid cells in sepsis prognosis, and the role of systemic cytokines in inducing emergency myelopoiesis during severe bacterial and SARS-CoV-2 infections.","NA",584,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.280180v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.280180v1.full.pdf

Proposed mechanisms involve host cell membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), such as transmembrane serine protease isoform 2 (TMPRSS2). The distribution of expression of these genes across cell types representing multiple organ systems in healthy individuals has been recently demonstrated. However, comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease are highly prevalent in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated with worse outcomes. Whether these conditions contribute directly to SARS-CoV-2 virulence remain unclear. Here we show that the expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and other viral entry-related genes are modulated in target organs of select disease states. In tissues such as heart, which normally express ACE2 but minimal TMPRSS2, we found that TMPRSS2 as well as other TTSPs are elevated in individuals with comorbidities vs healthy individuals. Additionally, we found increased expression of viral entry-related genes in the settings of hypertension, cancer or smoking across target organ systems.

We compared speech produced with and without the different masks on acoustic measures of timing, frequency, perturbation and power spectral density. Speech clarity was also examined using a standardized intelligibility tool by blinded raters. Mask type impacted the power distribution in frequencies above 3kHz for both the N95 and surgical masks. Measures of timing and spectral tilt also differed across mask conditions. Cepstral and harmonics to noise ratios remained flat across mask type. No differences were observed across conditions for word or sentence intelligibility measures.

Today, it appears as a threat to human civilization. Scientists and medical practitioners across the world are involved to trace out the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 (also called 2019 novel coronavirus and referred as 2019-nCoV), its transmission route, cause of pathogenicity, and possible remedial action. In this work, we aim to find out the origin, evolutionary patternthat led to its pathogenicity and possible transmission pathway of 2019-nCoV. To achieve the aims we conducted a large-scale deep phylogenetic analysis on the 162 complete Orthocoronavirinae genomes consisting of four genera namely Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus, their gene trees analysis and subsequently genome and gene recombination analyses. Our analyses revealed that i) bat, pangolin and anteater are the natural hosts of 2019-nCoV, ii) outbreak of 2019-nCoV took place via inter-intra species transmission mode, iii) host-specific adaptive mutation made 2019-nCoV more virulent, and the presence of widespread recombination events led to the evolution of new 2019-nCoV strain and/or could be determinant of its pathogenicity.

The mechanism and regulation of nsp13 has not been explored at the single-molecule level. Specifically, force-dependent unwinding experiments have yet to be performed for any coronavirus helicase. Here, using optical tweezers, we find that nsp13 unwinding frequency, processivity, and velocity increase substantially when a destabilizing force is applied to the dsRNA, suggesting a passive unwinding mechanism. These results, along with bulk assays, depict nsp13 as an intrinsically weak helicase that can be potently activated by picoNewton forces. Such force-dependent behavior contrasts the known behavior of other viral monomeric helicases, drawing stronger parallels to ring-shaped helicases.

Here we describe the patterns of within-host diversity in 1,181 SARS-CoV-2 samples sequenced to high depth in duplicate. 95% of samples show within-host mutations at detectable allele frequencies. Analyses of the mutational spectra revealed strong strand asymmetries suggestive of damage or RNA editing of the plus strand, rather than replication errors, dominating the accumulation of mutations during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Within and between host diversity show strong purifying selection, particularly against nonsense mutations. Recurrent within-host mutations, many of which coincide with known phylogenetic homoplasies, display a spectrum and patterns of purifying selection more suggestive of mutational hotspots than recombination or convergent evolution. While allele frequencies suggest that most samples result from infection by a single lineage, we identify multiple putative examples of co-infection.

Lymphopenia is a common feature in severe cases of COVID-19; however, the role of T cell responses during infection is unclear. Here, we inoculated six cynomolgus monkeys, divided into two groups according to the CD3+ T cell population in peripheral blood, with two clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2: one of East Asian lineage and one of European lineage. After initial infection with the isolate of East Asian lineage, all three monkeys in the CD3+ low group showed clinical symptoms, including loss of appetite, lethargy, and transient severe anemia with/without short-term fever, within 14 days post-infection (p.i.). By contrast, all three monkeys in the CD3+ high group showed mild clinical symptoms such as mild fever and loss of appetite within 4 days p.i. and then recovered. After a second inoculation with the isolate of European lineage, three of four animals in both groups showed mild clinical symptoms but recovered quickly. Hematological, immunological, and serological tests suggested that the CD3+ high and low groups mounted different immune responses during the initial and second infection stages. In both groups, anti-viral and innate immune responses were activated during the early phase of infection and re-infection. However, in the CD3+ low group, inflammatory responses, such as increased production of monocytes and neutrophils, were stronger than those in the CD3+ high group, leading to more severe immunopathology and failure to eliminate the virus. Taken together, the data suggest that the peripheral T lymphocyte population is associated with pneumonia severity in cynomolgus monkeys experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Lymphopenia, which is common in severe COVID-19 cases, is characterized by markedly reduced numbers of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells.

Several reports indicate short lasting immunity against endemic coronaviruses, which contrasts repeated reports that biobanked venous blood contains SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells even before the outbreak in Wuhan. This suggests there exists a preformed T cell memory in individuals not exposed to the pandemic virus. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to other members of the Coronaviridae family, the endemic coronaviruses appear likely candidates to generate this T cell memory. However, given the apparent poor immunological memory created by the endemic coronaviruses, other immunity against other common pathogens might offer an alternative explanation. Here, we utilize a combination of epitope prediction and similarity to common human pathogens to identify potential sources of the SARS-CoV-2 T cell memory. We find that no common human virus, other than beta-coronaviruses, can explain the pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in uninfected individuals.

Hence, drugs that can interfere the SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding to hACE2 potentially can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 from entering human cells. Here, based on the N-terminal helix 1 of human ACE2, we designed nine short peptides that have potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 binding.

Koonin,NIH,2020-11-13,2,cc_by_nc_nd,Microbiology,"Understanding the trends in SARS-CoV-2 evolution is paramount to control the COVID- 19 pandemic. We analyzed more than 300,000 high quality genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants available as of January 2021. The results show that the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic is characterized primarily by purifying selection, but a small set of sites appear to evolve under positive selection. The receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and the nuclear localization signal (NLS) associated region of the nucleocapsid protein are enriched with positively selected amino acid replacements. These replacements form a strongly connected network of apparent epistatic interactions and are signatures of major partitions in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny. Virus diversity within each geographic region has been steadily growing for the entirety of the pandemic, but analysis of the phylogenetic distances between pairs of regions reveals four distinct periods based on global partitioning of the tree and the emergence of key mutations. The initial period of rapid diversification into region- specific phylogenies that ended in February 2020 was followed by a major extinction event and global homogenization concomitant with the spread of D614G in the spike protein, ending in March 2020. The NLS associated variants across multiple partitions rose to global prominence in March-July, during a period of stasis in terms of inter- regional diversity. Finally, beginning July 2020, multiple mutations, some of which have since been demonstrated to enable antibody evasion, began to emerge associated with ongoing regional diversification, which might be indicative of speciation.

SignificanceUnderstanding the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to control and ultimately end the pandemic. We analyzed more than 300,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes available as of January 2021 and demonstrate adaptive evolution of the virus that affects, primarily, multiple sites in the spike and nucleocapsid protein. Selection appears to act on combinations of mutations in these and other SARS-CoV-2 genes. Evolution of the virus is accompanied by ongoing adaptive diversification within and between geographic regions. This diversification could substantially prolong the pandemic and the vaccination campaign, in which variant-specific vaccines are likely to be required.","NA",63,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.12.336644v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.12.336644v2.full.pdf

This study showed that knockdown of TRIM28 induces ACE2 expression and increases pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 cell entry of A549 cells and primary pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (PAEpiCs). In a co-culture model of NK cells and lung epithelial cells, our results demonstrated that NK cells inhibit TRIM28 and promote ACE2 expression in lung epithelial cells, which was partially reversed by depletion of interleukin-2 and blocking of granzyme B in the co-culture medium. Furthermore, TRIM28 knockdown enhanced interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma})-induced ACE2 expression through a mechanism involving upregulating IFN-{gamma} receptor 2 (IFNGR2) in both A549 and PAEpiCs.

S.",Nicholas S Heaton,Duke University School of Medicine,2020-07-31,3,cc_no,Microbiology,"The type I interferon (IFN) response is an important component of the innate immune response to viral infection. Precise control of interferon responses is critical; insufficient levels of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) can lead to a failure to restrict viral spread while excessive ISG activation can result in interferon-related pathologies. While both positive and negative regulatory factors control the magnitude and duration of IFN signaling, it is also appreciated that a number of ISGs regulate aspects of the interferon response themselves. However, the mechanisms underlying these ISG regulatory networks remain incompletely defined. In this study, we performed a CRISPR activation screen to identify new regulators of the type I IFN response. We identified ETS variant transcription factor 7 (ETV7), a strongly induced ISG, as a protein that acts as a negative regulator of the type I IFN response; however, ETV7 did not uniformly suppress ISG transcription. Instead, ETV7 preferentially targeted a subset of known antiviral ISGs. Further, we showed the subset of ETV7-modulated ISGs was particularly important for IFN-mediated control of some viruses including influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2. Together, our data assign a function for ETV7 as an IFN response regulator and also identify ETV7 as a therapeutic target to increase innate responses and potentiate the efficacy of interferon-based antiviral therapies.

The WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern therefore several scientists are dedicated to the study of the new virus. Since human viruses have codon usage biases that match highly expressed proteins in the tissues they infect and depend on host cell machinery for replication and co-evolution, we selected the genes that are highly expressed in the tissue of human lungs to perform computational studies that permit to compare their molecular features with SARS, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS genes. In our studies, we analysed 91 molecular features for 339 viral genes and 463 human genes that consisted of 677873 codon positions. Hereby, we found that A/T bias in viral genes could propitiate the viral infection favoured by a host dependant specialization using the host cell machinery of only some genes. The envelope protein E, the membrane glycoprotein M and ORF7 could have been further benefited by a high rate of A/T in the third codon position. Thereby, the mistranslation or de-regulation of protein synthesis could produce collateral effects, as a consequence of viral occupancy of the host translation machinery due tomolecular similarities with viral genes. Furthermore, we provided a list of candidate human genes whose molecular features match those of SARS-CoV-2, SARSand MERS genes, which should be considered to be incorporated into genetic population studies to evaluate thesusceptibility to respiratory viral infections caused by these viruses.

Here, we report the identification of CD209L/L-SIGN and the related protein CD209/DC-SIGN as receptors capable of mediating SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells. Immunofluorescence staining of human tissues revealed prominent expression of CD209L in the lung and kidney epithelium and endothelium. Multiple biochemical assays using a purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (S-RBD) and ectopically expressed CD209L and CD209 revealed that CD209L and CD209 interact with S-RBD. CD209L contains two N-glycosylation sequons, at sites N92 and N361, but only site N92 is occupied. Removal of the N-glycosylation at this site enhances the binding of S-RBD with CD209L. CD209L also interacts with ACE2, suggesting a role for heterodimerization of CD209L and ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection in cell types where both are present. Furthermore, we demonstrate that human endothelial cells are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and interference with CD209L activity by knockdown strategy or with soluble CD209L inhibits virus entry. Our observations demonstrate that CD209L and CD209 serve as alternative receptors for SARS-CoV-2 in disease-relevant cell types, including the vascular system. This property is particularly important in tissues where ACE2 has low expression or is absent, and may have implications for antiviral drug development.

SignificanceUnderstanding the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 with host cells is of high importance. ACE2 is recognized as a major entry receptor, but SARS-CoV-2 may also employ alternative receptors for cell entry and these may hold the key to infection in tissues, where ACE2 has a low expression level or is absent. We identify CD209L/L-SIGN and CD209/DC-SIGN as receptors for SARS-CoV-2. We show that CD209L is N-glycosylated and this modification modulates the binding of CD209L with spike protein. CD209L interacts with ACE2, suggesting that CD209L and ACE2 could function as co-receptors for SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection. Human endothelial cells are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In addition, we reported--for the first time--a recombination event of ORF8 at the whole-gene level in a bat and ultimately determined that ORF8 enhances the viral replication. In conjunction with our previous discoveries, we found that receptor binding abilities, junction furin cleavage sites (FCSs), strong first ribosome binding sites (RBSs) and enhanced ORF8s are main factors contributing to transmission, virulence and host adaptability of CoVs. Junction FCSs and enhanced ORF8s increase the efficiencies in viral entry into cells and replication, respectively while strong first RBSs enhance the translational initiation.

Unfolding curves revealed that the frameshift signal formed multiple different structures: at least two distinct pseudoknotted conformers with different unfolding forces and energy barriers, as well as alternative stem-loop structures. Refolding curves showed that stem 1 formed first in the pseudoknotted conformers, followed by stem 3 and then stem 2. By extending the handle holding the RNA to occlude the 5' end of stem 1, the proportion of the different pseudoknot conformers could be altered systematically, consistent with structures observed in cryo-EM images and computational simulations that had distinct topologies: the 5' end of the RNA threaded through the 3-helix junction to form a ring-knot, or unthreaded as in more standard H-type pseudoknots.

There is an urgent need to create novel models to study SARS-CoV-2 using human disease-relevant cells to understand key features of virus biology and facilitate drug screening. As primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is respiratory-based, we developed a lung organoid model using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that could be adapted for drug screens. The lung organoids, particularly aveolar type II cells, express ACE2 and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Transcriptomic analysis following SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed a robust induction of chemokines and cytokines with little type I/III interferon signaling, similar to that observed amongst human COVID-19 pulmonary infections. We performed a high throughput screen using hPSC-derived lung organoids and identified FDA-approved drug candidates, including imatinib and mycophenolic acid, as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 entry. Pre- or post-treatment with these drugs at physiologically relevant levels decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection of hPSC-derived lung organoids.

IgG1 ab1 does not have developability liabilities, and thus has potential for therapy and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The rapid identification (within 6 days) of potent mAbs shows the value of large antibody libraries for response to public health threats from emerging microbes.","NA",95,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.093088v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.093088v2.full.pdf

The gravity of the situation mandates accelerated efforts to identify safe and effective vaccines. Here, we generated measles virus (MeV)-based vaccine candidates expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S). Insertion of the full-length S protein gene in two different MeV genomic positions resulted in modulated S protein expression. The variant with lower S protein expression levels was genetically stable and induced high levels of effective Th1-biased antibody and T cell responses in mice after two immunizations. In addition to neutralizing IgG antibody responses in a protective range, multifunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses with S protein-specific killing activity were detected. These results are highly encouraging and support further development of MeV-based COVID-19 vaccines.

Significance StatementThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, yet. Therefore, effective vaccine concepts are urgently needed. In search for such a concept, we have analysed a measles virus-based vaccine candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2. Using this well known, safe vaccine backbone, we demonstrate here induction of functional immune responses in both arms of adaptive immunity with the desired immune bias. Therefore, occurrence of immunopathologies such as antibody-dependent enhancement or enhanced respiratory disease is rather unlikely. Moreover, the candidate still induces immunity against the measles, recognized as a looming second menace, when countries are entrapped to stop routine vaccination campaigns in the face of COVID-19. Thus, a bivalent measles-based COVID-19 vaccine could be the solution for two significant public health threats.","NA",302,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.198291v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.198291v1.full.pdf

In this study, we designed three different RBD-conjugated nanoparticles vaccine candidates, RBD-Ferritin (24-mer), RBD-mi3 (60-mer) and RBD-I53-50 (120-mer), with the application of covalent bond linking by SpyTag-SpyCatcher system. It was demonstrated that the neutralizing capability of sera from mice immunized with three RBD-conjugated nanoparticles adjuvanted with AddaVax or Sigma Systerm Adjuvant (SAS) after each immunization was ~8-to 120-fold greater than monomeric RBD group in SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and authentic virus neutralization assay. Most importantly, sera from RBD-conjugated NPs groups more efficiently blocked the binding of RBD to ACE2 or neutralizing antibody in vitro, a further proof of promising immunization effect. Besides, high physical stability and flexibility in assembly consolidated the benefit for rapid scale-up production of vaccine.

The disease is notably severe in elderly and those with underlying chronic conditions. A molecular mechanism that explains why the elderly are vulnerable and why children are resistant is largely unknown. Here we show loading cells with cholesterol from blood serum using the cholesterol transport protein apolipoprotein E (apoE) enhances the entry of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 and the infectivity of the virion. Super resolution imaging of the SARS-CoV-2 entry point with high cholesterol shows almost twice the total number of endocytic entry points. Cholesterol concomitantly traffics angiotensinogen converting enzyme (ACE2) to the endocytic entry site where SARS-CoV-2 presumably docks to efficiently exploit entry into the cell. Furthermore, in cells producing virus, cholesterol optimally positions furin for priming SARS-CoV-2, producing a more infectious virion with improved binding to the ACE2 receptor. In vivo, age and high fat diet induces cholesterol loading by up to 40% and trafficking of ACE2 to endocytic entry sites in lung tissue from mice. We propose a component of COVID19 severity based on tissue cholesterol level and the sensitivity of ACE2 and furin to cholesterol. Molecules that reduce cholesterol or disrupt ACE2 localization with viral entry points or furin localization in the producer cells, may reduce the severity of COVID19 in obese patients.","NA",69,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.09.086249v4?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.09.086249v4.full.pdf

These data reveal that 47D11 binds specifically to the closed conformation of the receptor binding domain, distal to the ACE2 binding site. The CDRL3 stabilises the N343 glycan in an upright conformation, exposing a conserved and mutationally constrained hydrophobic pocket, into which the CDRH3 loop inserts two aromatic residues. Interestingly, 47D11 preferentially selects for the partially open conformation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, suggesting that it could be used effectively in combination with other antibodies that target the exposed receptor-binding motif.

The spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 is a major antigen and its engagement with human ACE2 receptor plays an essential role in viral entry into host cells. Consequently, antibodies targeting the ACE2-interacting surface (ACE2IS) located in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein can neutralize the virus. However, the understanding of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 is still limited, and it is unclear how the virus protects this surface from recognition by antibodies. Here, we designed an RBD mutant that disrupts the ACE2IS and used it to characterize the prevalence of antibodies directed to the ACE2IS from convalescent sera of 94 COVID19-positive patients. We found that only a small fraction of RBD-binding antibodies targeted the ACE2IS. To assess the immunogenicity of different parts of the spike protein, we performed in vitro antibody selection for the spike and the RBD proteins using both unbiased and biased selection strategies. Intriguingly, unbiased selection yielded antibodies that predominantly targeted regions outside the ACE2IS, whereas ACE2IS-binding antibodies were readily identified from biased selection designed to enrich such antibodies. Furthermore, antibodies from an unbiased selection using the RBD preferentially bound to the surfaces that are inaccessible in the context of whole spike protein. These results suggest that the ACE2IS has evolved less immunogenic than the other regions of the spike protein, which has important implications in the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.",10.1016/j.jmb.2020.166748,358,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.03.365270v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.03.365270v1.full.pdf

We identified twelve potentially functional structural elements within the SARS-CoV-2 genome, observed that identical sequences can fold into divergent structures on different subgenomic RNAs, and that WT and {Delta}382 virus genomes can fold differently. Proximity ligation sequencing experiments identified hundreds of intramolecular and intermolecular pair-wise interactions within the virus genome and between virus and host RNAs. SARS-CoV-2 binds strongly to mitochondrial and small nucleolar RNAs and is extensively 2-O-methylated. 2-O-methylation sites in the virus genome are enriched in the untranslated regions and are associated with increased pair-wise interactions. SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a global decrease of 2-O-methylation sites on host mRNAs, suggesting that binding to snoRNAs could be a pro-viral mechanism to sequester methylation machinery from host RNAs towards the virus genome.

Here, we use RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling along SARS-CoV-2 infection and comprehensively define the mechanisms that are utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to shutoff cellular protein synthesis. We show SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to a global reduction in translation but that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated. Instead, we reveal that infection leads to accelerated degradation of cytosolic cellular mRNAs which facilitates viral takeover of the mRNA pool in infected cells. Moreover, we show that the translation of transcripts whose expression is induced in response to infection, including innate immune genes, is impaired, implying infection prevents newly transcribed cellular mRNAs from accessing the ribosomes.

We identified two activating variants (K26R and N720D) in the ACE2 gene that are more common in Europeans than in the Middle Eastern, East Asian, and African populations.

We describe here the singular metabolic background that creates a bottleneck constraining coronaviruses to evolve towards likely attenuation in the long term. Cytidine triphosphate (CTP) is at the crossroad of the biosynthetic processes that allow the virus to multiply. This is because CTP is in demand for three essential steps. It is a building block of the virus genome, it is required for synthesis of the cytosine-based liponucleotide precursors of the viral envelope and, finally, it is a critical building block of the host transfer RNAs synthesis. The CCA 3-end of all the transfer RNAs required to translate the RNA genome and further transcripts into the proteins used to build active virus copies is not coded in the human genome. It must be synthesized de novo from CTP and ATP. Furthermore, intermediary metabolism is built on compulsory steps of synthesis and salvage of cytosine-based metabolites via uridine triphosphate (UTP) that keep limiting CTP availability. As a consequence, accidental replication errors tend to replace cytosine by uracil in the genome, unless recombination events allow the sequence to return to its ancestral sequences. We document some of the consequences of this situation in the function of viral proteins. We also highlight and provide a raison detre to viperin, an enzyme of innate antiviral immunity, which synthesizes 3-deoxy-3',4-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP) as an extremely efficient antiviral nucleotide.",10.1093/gbe/evaa229,321,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.162933v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.162933v1.full.pdf

The specimens were tested by RT-PCR testing. The information collected for COVID-19 cases included basic demographic, clinical severity, onset of symptoms, radiological testing, laboratory testing and hospital admission. A total of 641 environmental surfaces and air specimens were collected among 39 COVID-19 cases before disinfection.

We compared the Malaysia weekly epidemiological records of dengue incidences during the period of lockdown to the trend of previous years (2015 to 2019) and a simulation at the corresponding period that expected no movement restrictions. We found that the dengue incidence declined significantly with a greater magnitude at phase 1 of lockdown, with a negative gradient of 3.2-fold steeper than the trend observed in previous years and 6.5-fold steeper than the simulation, indicating that the control of population movement did reduce dengue transmission. However, starting from phase 2 of lockdown, the dengue incidences demonstrated an elevation and earlier rebound by at least 4 weeks and grew with an exponential pattern compared to the simulation and previous years. Together with our data on Aedes mosquitoes from a district of Penang, Malaysia, we revealed that Aedes albopictus is the predominant species for both indoor and outdoor environments. The abundance of the mosquito was increasing steadily during the period of lockdown, and demonstrated strong correlation with the locally reported dengue incidences; therefore, we proposed the possible diffusive effect of vector that led to a higher acceleration of incidence rate.

Here, we developed two modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) based vaccines which express either a membrane anchored full-length spike protein (MVA/S) stabilized in a prefusion state or the S1 region of the spike (MVA/S1) which forms trimers and is secreted. Both immunogens contained the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which is a known target of antibody-mediated neutralization. Following immunizations with MVA/S or MVA/S1, both spike protein recombinants induced strong IgG antibodies to purified full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The MVA/S induced a robust antibody response to purified RBD, S1 and S2 whereas MVA/S1 induced an antibody response to the S1 region outside of the RBD region. Both vaccines induced an antibody response in the lung and that was associated with induction of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue. MVA/S but not MVA/S1 vaccinated mice generated robust neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 that strongly correlated with RBD antibody binding titers. Mechanistically, S1 binding to ACE-2 was strong but reduced following prolonged pre-incubation at room temperature suggesting confirmation changes in RBD with time.

Most of the common cold illnesses are caused by one of four HCoVs, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43. Several studies have applied global transcriptomic methods to understand host responses to HCoV infection, with most studies focusing on the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2. In this study, Next Generation Sequencing was used to gain new insights into cellular transcriptomic changes elicited by alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E. HCoV-229E-infected MRC5 cells showed marked downregulation of superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis and eIF2 signaling pathways. Moreover, upregulation of cyclins, cell cycle control of chromosomal replication, and the role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response, alongside downregulation of the cell cycle G1/S checkpoint, suggest that HCoV-229E favors S phase for viral infection. Intriguingly, a significant portion of key factors of cell innate immunity, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and other transcripts of early antiviral response genes were downregulated early in HCoV-229E infection. On the other hand, early upregulation of the antiviral response factor Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3B (APOBEC3B) was observed. APOBEC3B cytidine deaminase signature (C-to-T) was previously observed in genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 but not HCoV-229E. Higher levels of C-to-T mutations were found in countries with high mortality rates caused by SARS-CoV-2. APOBEC activity could be a marker for new emerging CoVs. This study will enhance our understanding of commonly circulating HCoVs and hopefully provide critical information about still-emerging coronaviruses.

Author summaryHuman coronaviruses (HCoVs) generate respiratory tract infections. HCoV-229E is one of four known HCoV strains that circulate annually in the population for several decades. Beside these, three pandemic CoV emerged since year 2002, the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2. These three strains attracted most attention for extensive research and less consideration has been given to the commonly infecting HCoVs. In this study we use Next generation sequencing analysis to understand global transcriptomic changes in human host cells following HCoV-229E infection. We found several cellular pathways that change during infection that involve cholesterol biosynthesis, cell cycle control, DNA replication, DNA repair, innate immune response and an interesting RNA editing enzyme which could be involve in CoVs pathogenesis.","NA",272,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.253682v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.253682v1.full.pdf

More than five hundred of the seven thousand top-ranking hits were synthesized by an external supplier and examined with respect to their activity in two biochemical assays: a protease activity assay and a thermal shift assay. Two clusters of chemical compounds with Mpro inhibitory activity were identified. An additional five hundred molecules, analogues of the compounds in the two clusters described above, were also synthesized and characterized in vitro. The study of the analogues revealed that the compounds of the first cluster acted by denaturing Mpro and might denature other proteins as well. In contrast, the compounds of the second cluster targeted Mpro with much greater specificity and enhanced its melting temperature, consistent with the formation of stable Mpro-inhibitor complexes. The most active compounds of the second cluster exhibited IC50 values between 4 and 7 M and their chemical structure suggests that they could serve as leads for the development of potent Mpro inhibitors.","NA",496,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.03.409441v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.03.409441v1.full.pdf

Though the substrate targets of the viral nucleotidyl transferase are unknown, NiRAN active sites are highly conserved and essential for viral replication 3. We show, for the first time, the detection and sequence location of GMP-modified amino acids in nidovirus RdRP-associated proteins using heavy isotope-assisted MS and MS/MS peptide sequencing. We identified lys-143 in the equine arteritis virus (EAV) protein, nsp7, as a primary site of nucleotidylation in vitro that uses a phosphoramide bond to covalently attach with GMP. In SARS-CoV-2 replicase proteins, we demonstrate a unique O-linked GMP attachment on nsp7 ser-1, whose formation required the presence of nsp12. It is clear that additional nucleotidylation sites remain undiscovered, which includes the possibility that nsp12 itself may form a transient GMP adduct in the NiRAN active site that has eluted detection in these initial studies due to instability of the covalent attachment. Our results demonstrate new strategies for detecting GMP-peptide linkages that can be adapted for higher throughput screening using mass spectrometric technologies. These data are expected to be important for a rapid and timely characterization of a new enzymatic activity in SARS-CoV-2 that may be an attractive drug target aimed at limiting viral replication in infected patients.","NA",275,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.07.330324v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.07.330324v1.full.pdf

The Spike protein, responsible for cell receptor binding and viral internalization, possesses multiple disulfide bonds raising the possibility that disulfide-reducing agents might disrupt Spike function, prevent viral entry and serve as effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Here we show the first experimental evidence that reagents capable of reducing disulfide bonds can inhibit viral infection in cell-based assays. Molecular dynamics simulations of the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) predict increased domain flexibility when the four disulfide bonds of the domain are reduced. This flexibility is particularly prominent for the surface loop, comprised of residues 456-490, which interacts with the Spike cell receptor ACE2. Consistent with this finding, the addition of exogenous disulfide bond reducing agents affects the RBD secondary structure, lowers its melting temperature from 52 to 36-39{degrees}C and decreases its binding affinity to ACE2 by two orders of magnitude at 37{degrees}C. Finally, the reducing agents dithiothreitol (DTT) and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) inhibit viral replication at high {micro}M - low mM levels with a negligible effect on cell viability at these concentrations. The antiviral effect of monothiol-based reductants N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and reduced glutathione (GSH) was not observed due to decreases in cell viability.

Moshkin,"Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, SB RAS, Novosibirsk, Russia",2020-04-11,1,cc_by_nc,Bioinformatics,"Finding novel biomarkers for human pathologies and predicting clinical outcomes for patients is rather challenging. This stems from the heterogenous response of individuals to disease which is also reflected in the inter-individual variability of gene expression responses. This in turn obscures differential gene expression analysis (DGE). In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, we wondered whether an alternative to DGE approaches could be applied to dissect the molecular nature of a host-response to infection exemplified here by an analysis of H1N1 influenza, community/hospital acquired pneumonia (CAP) and sepsis. To this end, we turned to the analysis of ensemble gene noise. Ensemble gene noise, as we defined it here, represents a variance within an individual for a collection of genes encoding for either members of known biological pathways or subunits of annotated protein complexes. From the law of total variance, ensemble gene noise depends on the stoichiometry of the ensemble genes expression and on their average noise (variance). Thus, rather than focusing on specific genes, ensemble gene noise allows for the holistic identification and interpretation of gene expression disbalance on the level of gene networks and systems. Comparing H1N1, CAP and sepsis patients we spotted common disturbances in a number of pathways/protein complexes relevant to the sepsis pathology which lead to an increase in the ensemble gene noise. Among others, these include mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and peroxisomes which could be readily targeted for adjuvant treatment by methylene blue and 4-phenylbutyrate respectively. Finally, we showed that ensemble gene noise could be successfully applied for the prediction of clinical outcome, namely mortality, of CAP and sepsis patients. Thus, we conclude that ensemble gene noise represents a promising approach for the investigation of molecular mechanisms of a pathology through a prism of alterations in coherent expression of gene circuits.","NA",474,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.035717v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.035717v1.full.pdf

Currently there are no protective vaccinations available and the only antiviral therapy in active use in patients is remdesivir, which provides only limited benefit(2, 3). Hence, an urgent need for antiviral therapies against SARS-CoV-2 exists. SARS-CoV requires Ca2+ ions for host cell entry and based on the similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 it is highly likely that the same requirements exist for both viruses(4, 5). Here, we tested whether FDA-approved calcium channel blocker (CCB) drugs can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture. All the CCBs showed varying degrees of inhibition, with amlodipine and nifedipine strongly limiting SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection in epithelial lung cells at concentrations where cell toxicity was minimal. Further studies with pseudo-typed particles carrying the SARS CoV 2 Spike protein suggest that viral inhibition occurs at the level of viral host cell entry.

In this study, we describe a modular virus-like particle vaccine candidate displaying the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) using SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology (RBD-SpyVLP). Low doses of RBD-SpyVLP in a prime-boost regimen induced a strong neutralising antibody response in mice and pigs that was superior to convalescent human sera. We evaluated antibody quality using ACE2 blocking and neutralisation of cell infection by pseudovirus or wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Using competition assays with a monoclonal antibody panel, we showed that RBD-SpyVLP induced a polyclonal antibody response that recognised all key epitopes on the RBD, reducing the likelihood of selecting neutralisation-escape mutants. The induction of potent and polyclonal antibody responses by RBD-SpyVLP provides strong potential to address clinical and logistic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, RBD-SpyVLP is highly resilient, thermostable and can be lyophilised without losing immunogenicity, to facilitate global distribution and reduce cold-chain dependence.",10.1038/s41467-020-20654-7,339,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.275701v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.275701v1.full.pdf

However, apart from some changes in protein coding, functional importance of these mutations in disease pathophysiology are still largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the significance of these mutations both from the hosts and viruss perspective by analyzing the host miRNA binding and viruss internal ribosome entry site (IRES), respectively. Strikingly, we observed that due to the acquired mutations, host miRNAs bind differently compared to the reference; where few of the miRNAs lost and few gained the binding affinity for targeting the viral genome. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis suggests that targets of both of these gained and lost miRNAs might be involved in various host immune signaling pathways. Also, we sought to shed some insights on the impacts of mutations on the IRES structure of SARS-CoV-2. Remarkably, we detected that three particular mutations in the IRES can disrupt its secondary structure which can further make the virus less functional. These results could be valuable in exploring the functional importance of the mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and could provide novel insights into the differences observed different parts of the world.","NA",296,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.150482v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.150482v1.full.pdf

In addition to human cells, it can also infect cell lines from diverse species. Coronavirus host range is determined by its spike glycoprotein (S). Given the importance of S protein in viral entry to cells and host immune responses, here we report the cryo-EM structure of the SADS-CoV S in the prefusion conformation at a resolution of 3.55 [A]. Our study reveals that SADS-CoV S structure takes an intra-subunit quaternary packing mode where the NTD and CTD from the same subunit pack together by facing each other. The comparison of NTD and CTD with that of the other four genera suggests the evolutionary process of the SADS-CoV S. Moreover, SADS-CoV S has several characteristic structural features, such as more compact architecture of S trimer, and masking of epitopes by glycan shielding, which may facilitate viral immune evasion.

Here we report the sequencing of a SARS-CoV-2 strain passaged six times after original isolation from a clinical patient in Hong Kong. The genome sequence shows a 27 nt in-frame deletion ({Delta}27,264-27,290) within ORF6, predicted to result in a 9 aa deletion ({Delta}FKVSIWNLD) from the central portion of p6. This deletion is predicted to result in a dramatic alteration in the three-dimensional structure of the resultant protein (p6{Delta}22-30), possibly with significant functional implications. Analysis of the original clinical sample indicates that the deletion was not present, while sequencing of subsequent passages of the strain identifies the deletion as a majority variant. This suggests that the deletion originated ab initio during passaging and subsequently propagated into the majority, possibly due to the removal of selective pressure through the IFN-deficient Vero E6 cell line. The specific function of the SARS-CoV-2 p6 N-terminus, if any, has not yet been determined.

Its main protease (Mpro) represents an attractive pharmacological target due to its involvement in essential viral functions. The crystal structure of free Mpro shows a large structural resemblance with the main protease of SARS CoV (nowadays known as SARS CoV-1). Here we report that as average SARS CoV-2 Mpro is 1900% more sensitive than SARS CoV-1 Mpro in transmitting tiny structural changes across the whole protein through long-range interactions. The largest sensitivity of Mpro to structural perturbations is located exactly around the catalytic site Cys-145, and coincides with the binding site of strong inhibitors. These findings, based on a simplified representation of the protein as a residue network, may help in designing potent inhibitors of SARS CoV-2 Mpro.

The main protease of the new coronavirus SARS CoV-2 represents one of the most important targets for the antiviral pharmacological actions againsts COVID-19. This enzyme is essential for the virus due to its proteolytic processing of polyproteins. Here we discover that the main protease of SARS CoV-2 is topologically very similar to that of the SARS CoV-1. This is not surprising taking into account that both proteases differ only in 12 amino acids. However, we remarkable found a topological property of SARS CoV-2 that has increased in more than 1900% repect to its SARS CoV-1 analogue. This property reflects the capacity of the new protease of transmitting perturbations across its domains using long-range interactions. Also remarkable is the fact that the amino acids displaying such increased sensitivity to perturbations are around the binding site of the new protease, and close to its catalytic site. We also show that this sensititivy to perturbations is related to the effects of powerful protease inhibitors. In fact, the strongest inhibitors of the SARS CoV-2 main protease are those that produce the least change of this capacity of transmitting perturbations across the protein. We think that these findings may help in the design of new potent anti-SARS CoV-2 inhibitors.",10.1063/5.0013029,102,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.023887v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.023887v2.full.pdf

Since the absence of antibodies does not equate to absence of immune memory, we sought to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B cells in COVID-19 convalescent patients. In this study, we report on the evolution of the overall humoral immune responses on 101 blood samples obtained from 32 COVID-19 convalescent patients between 16 and 233 days post-symptom onset. Our observations indicate that anti-Spike and anti-RBD IgM in plasma decay rapidly, whereas the reduction of IgG is less prominent. Neutralizing activity in convalescent plasma declines rapidly compared to Fc-effector functions. Concomitantly, the frequencies of RBD-specific IgM+ B cells wane significantly when compared to RBD-specific IgG+ B cells, which increase over time, and the number of IgG+ memory B cells which remain stable thereafter for up to 8 months after symptoms onset. With the recent approval of highly effective vaccines for COVID-19, data on the persistence of immune responses are of central importance. Even though overall circulating SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific antibodies contract over time during convalescence, we demonstrate that RBD-specific B cells increase and persist up to 8 months post symptom onset. We also observe modest increases in RBD-specific IgG+ memory B cells and importantly, detectable IgG and sustained Fc-effector activity in plasma over the 8-month period.

Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b is a potent interferon antagonist, suppressing the induction of type I interferon more efficiently than its SARS-CoV ortholog. Phylogenetic analyses and functional assays revealed that SARS-CoV-2-related viruses from bats and pangolins also encode truncated ORF3b gene products with strong anti-interferon activity. Furthermore, analyses of more than 15,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences identified a natural variant, in which a longer ORF3b reading frame was reconstituted. This variant was isolated from two patients with severe disease and further increased the ability of ORF3b to suppress interferon induction. Thus, our findings not only help to explain the poor interferon response in COVID-19 patients, but also describe a possibility of the emergence of natural SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies with extended ORF3b that may exacerbate COVID-19 symptoms.

ResultsMolecular modeling and simulations reveal that N501Y, shared by both variants, increases ACE2 binding affinity, and may impact the collective dynamics of the ACE2-RBD complex, occupying a central hinge site that modulates the overall dynamics of the complex. In contrast, the substitutions K417N and E484K in the South African variant 501.V2 would reduce the ACE2-binding affinity by abolishing two interfacial salt bridges that facilitate RBD binding to ACE2, K417(S)-D30(ACE2) and E484 (S)-K31(ACE2). These two mutations may thus be more than compensating the attractive effect induced by N501Y, overall resulting in an ACE2-binding affinity comparable to that of the wildtype RBD. Further analysis of the impact of these mutations on the interactions with mAbs targeting the spike indicate that the substitutions K417N and E484K may also abolish the salt bridges between the spike and selected mAbs, such as REGN10933, BD23, H11_H4, and C105, thus reducing the binding affinity and effectiveness of these mAbs.

Several investigational vaccines that have already been tested in animals and humans were able to induce neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, however protection and long-term efficacy in humans remain to be demonstrated.

We have investigated if a virus-like particle (VLP) derived from Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) could be engineered to become a candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine amenable to mass production. First, we showed that a codon optimized version of the S protein could migrate efficiently to the cell membrane. However, efficient production of infectious viral particles was only achieved with stable expression of a shorter version of S in its C-terminal domain ({Delta}S) in 293 cells that express MLV Gag-Pol (293GP). The incorporation of {Delta}S was 15-times more efficient into VLPs as compared to the full-length version, and that was not due to steric interference between the S cytoplasmic tail and the MLV capsid. Indeed, a similar result was also observed with extracellular vesicles released from parental 293 and 293GP cells. The amount of {Delta}S incorporated into VLPs released from producer cells was robust, with an estimated 1.25 g/ml S2 equivalent (S is comprised of S1 and S2). Thus, a scalable platform that has the potential for production of pan-coronavirus VLP vaccines has been established. The resulting nanoparticles could potentially be used alone or as a boost for other immunization strategies for COVID-19.

IMPORTANCESeveral candidate COVID-19 vaccines have already been tested in humans, but their protective effect and long-term efficacy are uncertain. Therefore, it is necessary to continue developing new vaccine strategies that could be more potent and/or that would be easier to manufacture in large-scale. Virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines are considered highly immunogenic and have been successfully developed for human papilloma virus as well as hepatitis and influenza viruses. In this study, we report the generation of a robust Moloney murine leukemia virus platform that produces VLPs containing the spike of SARS-CoV-2. This vaccine platform that is compatible with lyophilization could simplify storage and distribution logistics immensely.","NA",452,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.16.298992v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.16.298992v1.full.pdf

Using 28-colour flow cytometry and re-analysis of published RNA-seq datasets, we provide a detailed comparative analysis of NK cells and T cells in peripheral blood from moderately sick COVID-19 and influenza patients, focusing on the expression of chemokine receptors known to be involved in leukocyte recruitment to the lung.

Recently, many high-resolution apo and inhibitor-bound structures of Mpro, a cysteine protease, have been determined, facilitating structure-based drug design. Mpro plays a central role in the viral life cycle by catalyzing the cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins. In addition to the catalytic dyad His41-Cys145, Mpro contains multiple histidines including His163, His164, and His172. The protonation states of these histidines and the catalytic nu-cleophile Cys145 have been debated in previous studies of SARS-CoV Mpro, but have yet to be investigated for SARS-CoV-2. In this work we have used molecular dynamics simulations to determine the structural stability of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as a function of the protonation assignments for these residues. We simulated both the apo and inhibitor-bound enzyme and found that the conformational stability of the binding site, bound inhibitors, and the hydrogen bond networks of Mpro are highly sensitive to these assignments. Additionally, the two inhibitors studied, the peptidomimetic N3 and an -ketoamide, display distinct His41/His164 protonation-state-dependent stabilities. While the apo and the N3-bound systems favored N{delta} (HD) and N{epsilon} (HE) protonation of His41 and His164, respectively, the -ketoamide was not stably bound in this state.

Tang,The Chinese University of Hong Kong,2020-12-30,1,cc_by_nc_nd,Immunology,"Vaccination is a common and efficient means to reduce the mortality and morbidity of emerging infectious diseases. Among responders, injected antigen induces acquired immunity pathways and leads to the final production of antigen-specific antibodies. The whole process may take weeks to months, depending on the antigen. Typically, seroconversion to influenza vaccine is expected after one month with a responder rate of ~50%.

An early biomarker to predict response is desirable. Peripheral blood gene expression (or transcript abundance, TA) datasets in the public domain were analyzed for early biomarkers among responders. As peripheral blood samples (such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMC) are cell mixture samples containing various blood cell-types (leukocyte subpopulations, LS). We first develop a model that enables the determination of TA in B lymphocytes of certain genes directly in PBMC samples without the need of prior cell isolation. These genes are called B cell informative genes. Then a ratio of two B cell informative genes (a target gene and a stably expressed reference gene) measured in PBMC was used as a new biomarker to gauge the target gene expression in B lymphocytes. This method having an obvious advantage over conventional methods by eliminating the tedious procedure of cell sorting and enables directly determining TA of a leukocyte subpopulation in cell mixture samples is called Direct LS-TA method.

By using a B lymphocyte-specific gene such as TNFRSF17 or TXNDC5 as target genes with either TNFRSF13C or FCRLA as reference genes, the B cell biomarkers were determined directly in PBMC which was highly correlated with TA of target genes in purified B lymphocytes. These Direct LS-TA biomarkers in PBMC increased significantly early after vaccination in both the discovery dataset and a meta-analysis of 7 datasets. Responders had almost a 2-fold higher Direct LS-TA biomarker level of TNFRSF17 (SMD=0.84, 95% CI=0.47-1.21 after log2). And Direct LS-TA biomarkers of TNFRSF17 and TXNDC5 measured at day 7 predict responder with sensitivity values of higher than 0.7. The Area-under curves (AUC) in receiver operation curve (ROC) analysis were over 0.8.

Here, we report a straightforward approach to directly analyses B lymphocyte gene expression in PBMC, which could be used in a routine clinical setting as it avoids the labor-intensive procedures of B lymphocyte isolation. And the method allows the practice of precision medicine in the prediction of vaccination response.

Furthermore, response to vaccination could be predicted as early as on day 7. As vaccination response is based on the similar acquired immunology pathway in the upcoming worldwide vaccination campaign against COVID-19, these biomarkers could also be useful to predict seroconversion for individuals.",NA,190,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.29.424767v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.29.424767v1.full.pdf

Thus, effective measures are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in indoor environments. In this regard, we have investigated whether a system based on a filter combining Tungsten Trioxide-Based (WO3) photocatalysis and an antiviral fabric treated-copper nanocluster could inactivate SARS-CoV-2. To this purpose, an infectious SARS-CoV-2 suspension was introduced in the upper opening of a closed cylinder containing a WO3 filter and a lightbased system that activates WO3 and the antiviral fabric. From the bottom exit, aliquots of fluid were collected every 10 min (up to 60 min) and tested for their infectivity by means of a viral plaque assay in Vero cells whereas, in parallel, the viral RNA content was measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR). As we have previously shown for SARS-CoV, a 1:1,000 ratio of plaque forming units (PFU) vs. viral RNA copies was observed also for SARS-CoV-2. After 10 min, the infectious viral content was already decreased by 98.2% reaching 100% inactivation after 30 min whereas the SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was decreased of 1.5 log10 after 30 min. Thus, in spite of only a partial decrease of viral RNA, SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was completely abolished by the WO3 photocatalysis system by 30 min. These results support the hypothesis that this system could be exploited to achieve SARS-CoV-2 inactivation in indoor environments.","NA",89,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.01.232199v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.01.232199v1.full.pdf

Animal models are essential to fast track new interventions and nonhuman primate (NHP) models of other infectious diseases have proven extremely valuable. Here we compare SARS-CoV-2 infection in three species of experimentally infected NHPs (rhesus macaques, baboons, and marmosets). During the first 3 days, macaques developed clinical signatures of viral infection and systemic inflammation, coupled with early evidence of viral replication and mild-to-moderate interstitial and alveolar pneumonitis, as well as extra-pulmonary pathologies. Cone-beam CT scans showed evidence of moderate pneumonia, which progressed over 3 days. Longitudinal studies showed that while both young and old macaques developed early signs of COVID-19, both groups recovered within a two-week period. Recovery was characterized by low-levels of viral persistence in the lung, suggesting mechanisms by which individuals with compromised immune systems may be susceptible to prolonged and progressive COVID-19. The lung compartment contained a complex early inflammatory milieu with an influx of innate and adaptive immune cells, particularly interstitial macrophages, neutrophils and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and a prominent Type I-interferon response. While macaques developed moderate disease, baboons exhibited prolonged shedding of virus and extensive pathology following infection; and marmosets demonstrated a milder form of infection. These results showcase in critical detail, the robust early cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which are not sterilizing and likely impact development of antibody responses.

Worldwide concerted effort to identify viral genomic changes across different sub-types has identified several strong changes in the coding region. However, there have not been many studies focusing on the variations in the 5 and 3 untranslated regions and their consequences. Considering the possible importance of these regions in host mediated regulation of viral RNA genome, we wanted to explore the phenomenon.

MethodsTo have an idea of the global changes in 5 and 3-UTR sequences, we downloaded 8595 complete and high-coverage SARS-CoV2 genome sequence information from human host in FASTA format from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) from 15 different geographical regions. Next, we aligned them using Clustal Omega software and investigated the UTR variants. We also looked at the putative host RNA binding protein (RBP) and microRNA binding sites in these regions by  RBPmap and  RNA22 v2 respectively. Expression status of selected RBPs and microRNAs were checked in lungs tissue.

ResultsWe identified 28 unique variants in SARS-CoV2 UTR region based on a minimum variant percentage cut-off of 0.5. Along with 241C>T change the important 5-UTR change identified was 187A>G, while 29734G>C, 29742G>A/T and 29774C>T were the most familiar variants of 3UTR among most of the continents. Furthermore, we found that despite of the variations in the UTR regions, binding of host RBP to them remains mostly unaltered, which further influenced the functioning of specific miRNAs.

ConclusionOur results, shows for the first time in SARS-Cov2 infection, a possible cross-talk between host RBPs-miRNAs and viral UTR variants, which ultimately could explain the mechanism of escaping host RNA decay machinery by the virus.

A.; Earl, P. L.; Erez, N.; Peng, C.; Moss, B.",Bernard Moss,"NIAID, NIH",2021-01-01,1,cc0,Microbiology,"Replication-restricted modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is a licensed smallpox vaccine and numerous clinical studies investigating recombinant MVAs (rMVAs) as vectors for prevention of other infectious diseases have been completed or are in progress. Two rMVA COVID-19 vaccine trials are at an initial stage, though no animal protection studies have been reported. Here, we characterize rMVAs expressing the S protein of CoV-2. Modifications of full length S individually or in combination included two proline substitutions, mutations of the furin recognition site and deletion of the endoplasmic retrieval signal. Another rMVA in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) flanked by the signal peptide and transmembrane domains of S was also constructed. Each modified S protein was displayed on the surface of rMVA-infected human cells and was recognized by anti-RBD antibody and by soluble hACE2 receptor. Intramuscular injection of mice with the rMVAs induced S-binding and pseudovirus-neutralizing antibodies. Boosting occurred following a second homologous rMVA but was higher with adjuvanted purified RBD protein. Weight loss and lethality following intranasal infection of transgenic hACE2 mice with CoV-2 was prevented by one or two immunizations with rMVAs or by passive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice. One or two rMVA vaccinations also prevented recovery of infectious CoV-2 from the lungs. A low amount of virus was detected in the nasal turbinates of only one of eight rMVA-vaccinated mice on day 2 and none later. Detection of subgenomic mRNA in turbinates on day 2 only indicated that replication was abortive in immunized animals.

SignificanceVaccines are required to control COVID-19 during the pandemic and possibly afterwards. Recombinant nucleic acids, proteins and virus vectors that stimulate immune responses to the CoV-2 S protein have provided protection in experimental animal or human clinical trials, though questions remain regarding their ability to prevent spread and the duration of immunity. The present study focuses on replication-restricted modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), which has been shown to be a safe, immunogenic and stable smallpox vaccine and a promising vaccine vector for other infectious diseases and cancer. In a transgenic mouse model, one or two injections of recombinant MVAs that express modified forms of S inhibited CoV-2 replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and prevented severe disease.","NA",36,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.30.424878v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.30.424878v1.full.pdf

There are currently no antiviral drugs or vaccines to treat COVID-19, and the failure to identify effective interventions can be blamed on our incomplete understanding of the nature of this virus and its host cell infection process. Here, we experimentally determined structural maps of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome in infected human cells and also characterized in vitro refolded RNA structures for SARS-CoV-2 and 6 other coronaviruses. Our in vivo data confirms several structural elements predicted from theoretical analysis and goes much further in revealing many previously unknown structural features that functionally impact viral translation and discontinuous transcription in cells. Importantly, we harnessed our in vivo structure data alongside a deep-learning tool and accurately predicted several dozen functionally related host cell proteins that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, none of which were known previously. Thus, our in vivo structural study lays a foundation for coronavirus RNA biology and indicates promising directions for the rapid development of therapeutics to treat COVID-19.HIGHLIGHTSWe mapped the in vivo structure and built secondary structural models of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genomeWe discovered functionally impactful structural features in the RNA genomes of multiple coronavirusesWe predicted and validated host cell proteins that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome based on our in vivo RNA structural data using a deep-learning toolCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","NA",486,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.192732v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.192732v1.full.pdf

Aiming to understand a host genetic component of COVID-19, we focused on variants in genes encoding proteases and genes involved in innate immunity that could be important for susceptibility and resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Analysis of sequence data of coding regions of FURIN, PLG, PRSS1, TMPRSS11a, MBL2 and OAS1 genes in 143 unrelated individuals from Serbian population identified 22 variants with potential functional effect. In silico analyses (PolyPhen-2, SIFT, MutPred2 and Swiss-Pdb Viewer) predicted that 10 variants could impact the structure and/or function of proteins. These protein-altering variants (p.Gly146Ser in FURIN; p.Arg261His and p.Ala494Val in PLG; p.Asn54Lys in PRSS1; p.Arg52Cys, p.Gly54Asp and p.Gly57Glu in MBL2; p.Arg47Gln, p.Ile99Val and p.Arg130His in OAS1) may have predictive value for inter-individual differences in the response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Next, we performed comparative population analysis for the same variants using extracted data from the 1000 genomes project. Population genetic variability was assessed using delta MAF and Fst statistics. Our study pointed to 7 variants in PLG, TMPRSS11a, MBL2 and OAS1 genes with noticeable divergence in allelic frequencies between populations worldwide. Three of them, all in MBL2 gene, were predicted to be damaging, making them the most promising population-specific markers related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Comparing allelic frequencies between Serbian and other populations, we found that the highest level of genetic divergence related to selected loci was observed with African, followed by East Asian, Central and South American and South Asian populations. When compared with European populations, the highest divergence was observed with Italian population.

In conclusion, we identified 4 variants in genes encoding proteases (FURIN, PLG and PRSS1) and 6 in genes involved in the innate immunity (MBL2 and OAS1) that might be relevant for the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104498,443,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.093690v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.093690v1.full.pdf

The RBD is the primary SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing epitope and a critical target of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Here we show that this RBD conjugated to each of two carrier proteins elicited more potent neutralizing responses in immunized rodents than did a similarly conjugated proline-stabilized S-protein ectodomain. Nonetheless, the native RBD expresses inefficiently, limiting its usefulness as a vaccine antigen. However, we show that an RBD engineered with four novel glycosylation sites (gRBD) expresses markedly more efficiently, and generates a more potent neutralizing responses as a DNA vaccine antigen, than the wild-type RBD or the full-length S protein, especially when fused to multivalent carriers such as an H. pylori ferritin 24-mer. Further, gRBD is more immunogenic than the wild-type RBD when administered as a subunit protein vaccine.

Here we demonstrate the successful identification of compounds that display efficacy in blocking SARS-CoV-2 replication based on their ability to counteract the virus-induced transcriptional landscape. These compounds were found to potently reduce viral load despite having no impact on viral entry or modulation of the host antiviral response in the absence of virus.

In this study, we mined 3 independent RNA expression datasets from smokers and vapers to understand the potential relationship between vaping/smoking and the dysregulation of key genes and pathways related to COVID-19. We found that smoking, but not vaping, upregulates ACE2, the cellular receptor that SARS-CoV-2 requires for infection. Both smoking and use of nicotine and flavor-containing e-cig led to upregulations of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression of genes related to inflammasomes. Vaping flavor-less and nicotine-less e-cig, however, did not lead to significant cytokine dysregulation and inflammasome activation. Release of inflammasome products, such as IL-1B, and cytokine storms are hallmarks of COVID-19 infection, especially in severe cases.

We show that while Nsp1-CT is sufficient for binding to 40S and inhibition of host protein translation, the 5 UTR of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA removes this inhibition by binding to Nsp1-NT, suggesting that the Nsp1-NT-UTR interaction is incompatible with the Nsp1-CT-40S interaction. Indeed, lengthening the linker between Nsp1-NT and Nsp1-CT of Nsp1 progressively reduced the ability of SARS-CoV-2 5 UTR to escape the translational inhibition, supporting that the incompatibility is likely steric in nature. The short SL1 region of the 5 UTR is required for viral mRNA translation in the presence of Nsp1. Thus, our data provide a comprehensive view on how Nsp1 switches infected cells from host mRNA translation to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA translation, and that Nsp1 and 5 UTR may be targeted for anti-COVID-19 therapeutics.","NA",277,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.18.302901v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.18.302901v1.full.pdf

R.; Miller, A. C.",John Postlethwait,University of Oregon,2020-09-02,1,cc_no,Developmental Biology,"People with underlying conditions, including hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, are especially susceptible to negative outcomes after infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. These COVID-19 comorbidities are exacerbated by the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), which normally protects from rapidly dropping blood pressure or dehydration via the peptide Angiotensin II (Ang II) produced by the enzyme Ace. The Ace paralog Ace2 degrades Ang II, thus counteracting its chronic effects. Ace2 is also the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Ace, the coronavirus, and COVID-19 comorbidities all regulate Ace2, but we dont yet understand how. To exploit zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a disease model to understand mechanisms regulating the RAAS and its relationship to COVID-19 comorbidities, we must first identify zebrafish orthologs and co-orthologs of human RAAS genes, and second, understand where and when these genes are expressed in specific cells in zebrafish development. To achieve these goals, we conducted genomic analyses and investigated single cell transcriptomes. Results showed that most human RAAS genes have an ortholog in zebrafish and some have two or more co-orthologs. Results further identified a specific intestinal cell type in zebrafish larvae as the site of expression for key RAAS components, including Ace, Ace2, the coronavirus co-receptor Slc6a19, and the Angiotensin-related peptide cleaving enzymes Anpep and Enpep. Results also identified specific vascular cell subtypes as expressing Ang II receptors, apelin, and apelin receptor genes. These results identify specific genes and cell types to exploit zebrafish as a disease model for understanding the mechanisms leading to COVID-19 comorbidities.

SUMMARY STATEMENTGenomic analyses identify zebrafish orthologs of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System that contribute to COVID-19 comorbidities and single-cell transcriptomics show that they act in a specialized intestinal cell type.","NA",564,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.278366v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.278366v1.full.pdf

The commonality is in the phylogenetic retrodiction based on the genomic reads in both scenarios. While there is evidence of heteroplasmy, i.e., multiple lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the same COVID-19 patient; to date, there is no evidence of sublineages recombining within the same patient. The heterogeneity in a patients tumor is analogous to intra-patient heteroplasmy and the absence of recombination in the cells of tumor is a widely accepted assumption. Just as the different frequencies of the genomic variants in a tumor presupposes the existence of multiple tumor clones and provides a handle to computationally infer them, we postulate that so do the different variant frequencies in the viral reads, offering the means to infer the multiple co-infecting sublineages. We describe the Concerti computational framework for inferring phylogenies in each of the two scenarios. To demonstrate the accuracy of the method, we reproduce some known results in both scenarios. We also make some additional discoveries. We uncovered new potential parallel mutation in the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Although SARS-CoV-2 propagates efficiently in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, antivirals such as nucleos(t)ide analogs (nucs) often exhibit decreased activity in these cells due to inefficient metabolization. Limited SARS-CoV-2 replication and propagation occurs in human cells, which are the most relevant testing platforms. By performing serial passages of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate in the human hepatoma cell line clone Huh7.5, we selected viral populations with improved viability in human cells. Culture adaptation led to the emergence of a significant number of high frequency changes (>90% of the viral population) in the region coding for the spike glycoprotein, including a deletion of nine amino acids in the N-terminal domain and 3 amino acid changes (E484D, P812R, and Q954H). We demonstrated that the Huh7.5-adapted virus exhibited a >3-Log10 increase in infectivity titers (TCID50) in Huh7.5 cells, with titers of ~8 Log10TCID50/mL, and >2-Log10 increase in the human lung cancer cell line Calu-1, with titers of ~6 Log10TCID50/mL. Culture adaptation in Huh7.5 cells further permitted efficient infection of the otherwise SARS-CoV-2 refractory human lung cancer cell line A549, with titers of ~6 Log10TCID50/mL. The enhanced ability of the virus to replicate and propagate in human cells permitted screening of a panel of nine nucs, including broad-spectrum compounds. Remdesivir, EIDD-2801 and to a limited extent galidesivir showed antiviral effect across these human cell lines, whereas sofosbuvir, uprifosbuvir, valopicitabine, mericitabine, ribavirin, and favipiravir had no apparent activity.

ImportanceThe cell culture adapted variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained in the present study, showed significantly enhanced replication and propagation in various human cell lines, including lung derived cells otherwise refractory for infection with the original virus. This SARS-CoV-2 variant will be a valuable tool permitting investigations across human cell types, and studies of identified mutations could contribute to our understanding of viral pathogenesis. In particular, the adapted virus can be a good model for investigations of viral entry and cell tropism for SARS-CoV-2, in which the spike glycoprotein plays a central role. Further, as shown here with the use of remdesivir and EIDD-2801, two nucs with significant inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2, large differences in the antiviral activity are observed depending on the cell line. Thus, it is essential to select the most relevant target cells for pre-clinical screenings of antiviral compounds, facilitated by using a virus with broader tropism.","NA",313,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.04.325316v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.04.325316v1.full.pdf

The virus enters host cells through an interaction between the spike glycoprotein and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Directly preventing this interaction presents an attractive possibility for suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here we report the isolation and characterization of an alpaca-derived single domain antibody fragment, Ty1, that specifically targets the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, directly preventing ACE2 engagement. The nanobody binds with high affinity in the low nM range to the RBD, occluding ACE2. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bound complex at 2.9 Å resolution reveals that Ty1 binds to an epitope on the RBD accessible in both the ‘up’ and ‘down’ conformations and that Ty1 sterically hinders RBD-ACE2 binding. This 12.8 kDa nanobody does not need an Fc domain to neutralize SARS-CoV-2, and can be expressed in high quantities in bacteria, presenting opportunities for manufacturing at scale. Ty1 is therefore an excellent candidate as an intervention against COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",10.1038/s41467-020-18174-5,95,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.02.130161v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.02.130161v2.full.pdf

A.; Wang, H.; Hansen, S.",Scott Hansen,The Scripps Research Institute,2020-10-30,2,cc_by_nc_nd,Cell Biology,"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been proposed in the treatment of SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, albeit with much controversy. In vitro, HCQ effectively inhibits viral entry, but its use in the clinic has been hampered by conflicting results. A better understanding of HCQs mechanism of actions in vitro is needed to resolve these conflicts. Recently, anesthetics were shown to disrupt ordered monosialotetrahexosylganglioside1 (GM1) lipid rafts. These same lipid rafts recruit the SARS-CoV-2 surface receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to an endocytic entry point, away from phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2) domains. Here we employed super resolution imaging of cultured mammalian cells to show HCQ directly perturbs GM1 lipid rafts and inhibits the ability of ACE2 receptor to associate with the endocytic pathway. HCQ also disrupts PIP2 domains and their ability to cluster and sequester ACE2. Similarly, the antibiotic erythromycin inhibits viral entry and both HCQ and erythromycin decrease the antimicrobial host defense peptide amyloid beta in cultured cells. We conclude HCQ is an anesthetic-like compound that disrupts GM1 lipid rafts similar to anesthetics. The disruption likely decreases viral clustering at both endocytic and putative PIP2 entry points.

KEY POINTSQuestion: What is the molecular basis for antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine?

Findings: Hydroxychloroquine disrupt lipid rafts similar to general anesthetics.

Meaning: Since lipids cluster ACE2 and facilitate viral entry, hydroxychloroquine appears to inhibit viral entry by disrupting the lipid clustering of the SARS-CoV2 receptor.","NA",84,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.250217v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.250217v2.full.pdf

Within populations, we identify wide inter-individual variability in predicted CD4+ T-cell reactivity against structural, non-structural and accessory SARS-CoV-2 proteins, according to expressed HLA genotype. However, we find similar potential for anti-SARS-CoV-2 cellular immunity at the population level, across all ethnic groups examined, suggesting that HLA polymorphism is unlikely to account for observed disparities in clinical outcomes after COVID-19 among different race and ethnic groups. We predict robust immune reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, the basis for the majority of current vaccination efforts, both at the population and individual level, despite significant variation in Spike-derived peptide presentation by individual HLA genotypes.

The Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center supports two pipeline programs, which traditionally immerse high school juniors, seniors, and early undergraduate students from underrepresented populations in science in hands-on projects in cancer biology labs. However, due to social distancing policies during the pandemic and reduction of research operations, these students were not physically allowed on campus. Thus, the authors set out to strategically pivot to a wholly virtual curriculum and evaluate the Virtual Summer Research Experience in Cancer outcomes.

MethodsThe virtual program included four components: 1. a core science and professional development curriculum led by high school teachers and senior undergraduates; 2. faculty-delivered didactic sessions on cancer science; 3. mentored, virtual research projects with research faculty; and 4. online networking events to encourage vertical mentoring. Outcomes data were measured using an 11-item Research Preparation scale, daily electronic feedback, and structured evaluation and feedback via Zoom weekly.

ResultsOutcome data suggested high self-reported satisfaction with the virtual program. Outcome data also revealed the importance of coordination between multiple entities for seamless program implementation. This includes the active recruitment and participation of high school teachers and further investment in information technology capabilities of institutions.

ConclusionsFindings reveal a path to educate and train high school and early undergraduate students in cancer research when hands-on, in-person training is not feasible. Virtual research experiences are not only useful to engage students during public health crises but can provide an avenue for cancer centers to expand their cancer education footprints to remotely located schools and universities with limited resources to provide such experiences to their students.","NA",207,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.23.393967v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.23.393967v1.full.pdf

While several studies have investigated S requirements involved in viral particle entry, examination of S stability and factors involved in S cell-cell fusion remain limited. We demonstrate that S must be processed at the S1/S2 border in order to mediate cell-cell fusion, and that mutations at potential cleavage sites within the S2 subunit alter S processing at the S1/S2 border, thus preventing cell-cell fusion. We also identify residues within the internal fusion peptide and the cytoplasmic tail that modulate S cell-cell fusion. Additionally, we examine S stability and protein cleavage kinetics in a variety of mammalian cell lines, including a bat cell line related to the likely reservoir species for SARS-CoV-2, and provide evidence that proteolytic processing alters the stability of the S trimer.

Its utility in text-mining and document retrieval tasks in various fields of scientific research is rather well known. An unsupervised machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has particularly been utilized for identifying latent (or hidden) topics in document collections and for deciphering the words that define one or more topics using a generative statistical model. Here we describe how SARS-CoV-2 genomic mutation profiles can be structured into a  Bag of Words to enable identification of signatures (topics) and their probabilistic distribution across various genomes using LDA. Topic models were generated using ~47000 novel corona virus genomes (considered as documents), leading to identification of 16 amino acid mutation signatures and 18 nucleotide mutation signatures (equivalent to topics) in the corpus of chosen genomes through coherence optimization. The document assumption for genomes also helped in identification of contextual nucleotide mutation signatures in the form of conventional N-grams (e.g. bi-grams and tri-grams). We validated the signatures obtained using LDA driven method against the previously reported recurrent mutations and phylogenetic clades for genomes. Additionally, we report the geographical distribution of the identified mutation signatures in SARS-CoV-2 genomes on the global map. Use of the non-phylogenetic albeit classical approaches like topic modeling and other data centric pattern mining algorithms is therefore proposed for supplementing the efforts towards understanding the genomic diversity of the evolving SARS-CoV-2 genomes (and other pathogens/microbes).","NA",323,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.258772v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.258772v1.full.pdf

The pathogen SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the lower respiratory tract and causes fatal pneumonia. Although tremendous efforts have been put into investigating the pathogeny of SARS-CoV-2, the underlying mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with its host is largely unexplored. Here, by comparing the genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and human, we identified five fully conserved elements in SARS-CoV-2 genome, which were termed as ""human identical sequences (HIS)"". HIS are also recognized in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV genome. Meanwhile, HIS-SARS-CoV-2 are highly conserved in the primate. Mechanically, HIS-SARS-CoV-2, behaving as virus-derived miRNAs, directly target to the human genomic loci and further interact with host enhancers to activate the expression of adjacent and distant genes, including cytokines gene and angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), a well-known cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2), which further increases hyaluronan formation. Noteworthily, hyaluronan level in plasma of COVID-19 patients is tightly correlated with severity and high risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and may act as a predictor for the progression of COVID-19. HIS antagomirs, which downregulate hyaluronan level effectively, and 4-Methylumbelliferone (MU), an inhibitor of hyaluronan synthesis, are potential drugs to relieve the ARDS related ground-glass pattern in lung for COVID-19 treatment. Our results revealed that unprecedented HIS elements of SARS-CoV-2 contribute to the cytokine storm and ARDS in COVID-19 patients. Thus, blocking HIS-involved activating processes or hyaluronan synthesis directly by 4-MU may be effective strategies to alleviate COVID-19 progression.","NA",375,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.361576v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.361576v1.full.pdf

However, animal models, particularly non-human primate models, are urgently needed for critical questions that could not be answered in clinical patients, evaluations of anti-viral drugs and vaccines. In this study, two families of non-human primates, Old world monkeys (12 Macaca mulatta, 6 Macaca fascicularis) and New world monkeys (6 Callithrix jacchus), were experimentally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Clinical signs were recorded. Samples were collected for analysis of viral shedding, viremia and histopathological examination. Increased body temperature was observed in 100% (12/12) M. mulatta, 33.3% (2/6) M. fascicularis and none (0/6) of C. jacchus post inoculation of SARS-CoV-2. All of M. mulatta and M. fascicularis showed chest radiographic abnormality. Viral genomes were detected in nasal swabs, throat swabs, anal swabs and blood from all 3 species of monkeys. Viral shedding from upper respiratory samples reached the peak between day 6 and day 8 post inoculation. From necropsied M. mulatta and M. fascicularis, the tissues showing virus positive were mainly lung, weasand, bronchus and spleen. No viral genome was seen in any of tissues from 2 necropsied C. jacchus. Severe gross lesions and histopathological changes were observed in lung, heart and stomach of SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. In summary, we have established a NHP model for COVID-19, which could be used to evaluate drugs and vaccines, and investigate viral pathogenesis.

Murphy,Sarah Cook,University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine,2020-07-09,1,cc_by,Pharmacology And Toxicology,"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), caused by a genetic mutant of feline enteric coronavirus known as FIPV, is a highly fatal disease of cats with no currently available vaccine or FDA-approved cure. Dissemination of FIPV in affected cats results in a range of clinical signs including cavitary effusions, anorexia, fever and lesions of pyogranulomatous vasculitis and peri-vasculitis with or without central nervous system and/or ocular involvement. There is a critical need for effective and approved antiviral therapies against coronaviruses including FIPV and zoonotic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19. With regards to SARS-CoV-2, preliminary evidence suggests that there may be potential clinical and pathological overlap with feline coronaviral disease including enteric and neurological involvement in some cases. We have screened 89 putative antiviral compounds and have identified 25 compounds with antiviral activity against FIPV, representing a variety of drug classes and mechanisms of antiviral action. Based upon successful combination treatment strategies for human patients with HIV or hepatitis C virus infections, we have identified combinations of drugs targeting different steps of the FIPV life cycle resulting in synergistic antiviral effect. Translationally, we suggest that a combined anticoronaviral therapy (cACT) with multiple mechanisms of action and penetration of all potential anatomic sites of viral infection should be applied towards other challenging to treat coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV-2.

Author summaryWe have screened 89 compounds in vitro for antiviral activity against FIPV. The putative antiviral activity of these compounds was either purported to be a direct effect on viral proteins involved in viral replication or an indirect inhibitory effect on normal cellular pathways usurped by FIPV to aid viral replication. Twenty-five of these compounds were found to have significant antiviral activity. Certain combinations of these compounds were determined to be superior to monotherapy alone.","NA",379,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.195016v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.195016v1.full.pdf

We previously demonstrated that five nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), including the active triphosphate forms of Sofosbuvir, Alovudine, Zidovudine, Tenofovir alafenamide and Emtricitabine. We report here the evaluation of a library of additional nucleoside triphosphate analogues with a variety of structural and chemical features as inhibitors of the RdRps of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. These features include modifications on the sugar (2 or 3 modifications, carbocyclic, acyclic, or dideoxynucleotides) or on the base. The goal is to identify nucleotide analogues that not only terminate RNA synthesis catalyzed by these coronavirus RdRps, but also have the potential to resist the viruses exonuclease activity. We examined these nucleotide analogues with regard to their ability to be incorporated by the RdRps in the polymerase reaction and then prevent further incorporation. While all 11 molecules tested displayed incorporation, 6 exhibited immediate termination of the polymerase reaction (Carbovir triphosphate, Ganciclovir triphosphate, Stavudine triphosphate, Entecavir triphosphate, 3-O-methyl UTP and Biotin-16-dUTP), 2 showed delayed termination (Cidofovir diphosphate and 2-O-methyl UTP), and 3 did not terminate the polymerase reaction (2-fluoro-dUTP, 2-amino-dUTP and Desthiobiotin-16-UTP). The coronavirus genomes encode an exonuclease that apparently requires a 2 -OH group to excise mismatched bases at the 3-terminus. In this study, all of the nucleoside triphosphate analogues we evaluated form Watson-Cricklike base pairs. All the nucleotide analogues which demonstrated termination either lack a 2-OH, have a blocked 2-OH, or show delayed termination. These nucleotides may thus have the potential to resist exonuclease activity, a property that we will investigate in the future. Furthermore, prodrugs of five of these nucleotide analogues (Brincidofovir/Cidofovir, Abacavir, Valganciclovir/Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir) are FDA approved for other viral infections, and their safety profile is well known.

Teaching this in a traditional teaching setting is quite challenging especially with a large crowd of students to be kept engaged. This is even more difficult if, as during the COVID-19 crisis, students are not allowed to access laboratories for hands-on observation on fresh specimens and sometimes restricted to short-range movements outside their home.

Here we present QuoVidi, a new open-source web platform for the organisation of large scale treasure hunts. The platform works as follows: students, organised in teams, receive a list of quests that contain morphologic, ecologic or systematic terms. They have to first understand the meaning of the quests, then go and find them in the environment. Once they find the organism corresponding to a quest, they upload a geotagged picture of their finding and submit this on the platform. The correctness of each submission is evaluated by the staff. During the COVID-19 lockdown, previously validated pictures were also submitted for evaluation to students that were locked in low-biodiversity areas. From a research perspective, the system enables the creation of large image databases by the students, similar to citizen-science projects.

Beside the enhanced motivation of students to learn the vocabulary and perform observations on self-found specimens, this system allows faculties to remotely follow and assess the work performed by large numbers of students. The interface is freely available, open-source and customizable. It can be used in other disciplines with adapted quests and we expect it to be of interest in many classroom settings.","NA",369,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.177006v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.177006v1.full.pdf

Previously, we reached clinical evaluation with our vector vaccine based on vaccinia virus MVA against the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which causes an infection in humans similar to SARS and COVID-19. Here, we describe the construction and preclinical characterization of a recombinant MVA expressing full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (MVA-SARS-2-S). Genetic stability and growth characteristics of MVA-SARS-2-S, plus its robust synthesis of S antigen, make it a suitable candidate vaccine for industrial scale production. Vaccinated mice produced S antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and serum antibodies binding to S glycoprotein that neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Prime-boost vaccination with MVA-SARS-2-S protected mice sensitized with a human ACE2-expressing adenovirus from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Significance StatementThe highly attenuated vaccinia virus MVA is licensed as smallpox vaccine, and as vector it is a component of the approved Adenovirus-MVA-based prime-boost vaccine against Ebola virus disease. Here we provide results from testing the COVID-19 candidate vaccine MVA-SARS-2-S, a poxvirus-based vector vaccine that proceeded to clinical evaluation.

To assess whether human cortical cells can be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2, we utilized primary human cortical tissue and stem cell-derived cortical organoids. We find significant and predominant infection in cortical astrocytes in both primary and organoid cultures, with minimal infection of other cortical populations. Infected astrocytes had a corresponding increase in reactivity characteristics, growth factor signaling, and cellular stress. Although human cortical cells, including astrocytes, have minimal ACE2 expression, we find high levels of alternative coronavirus receptors in infected astrocytes, including DPP4 and CD147. Inhibition of DPP4 reduced infection and decreased expression of the cell stress marker, ARCN1. We find tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for human astrocytes mediated by DPP4, resulting in reactive gliosis-type injury.","NA",75,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.17.427024v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.17.427024v1.full.pdf

We recently identified immunogenic epitopes within CVB3 viral protein 1 that induce anti-viral T cell responses in mouse models of CVB infections. In our investigations to determine the protective responses of the viral epitopes, we unexpectedly noted that animals immunized with complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) alone and later challenged with CVB3 were completely protected against myocarditis. Similarly, the pancreatitis-inducing ability of CVB3 was remarkably reduced to only 10% in the CFA group as opposed to 73.3% in the control group that received no CFA. Additionally, no mortalities were noted in the CFA group, whereas 40% of control animals died during the course of 21 days post-infection with CVB3. Taken together, our data suggest that the adjuvant effects of CFA may be sufficient for protection against CVB infections.

Work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 is currently restricted to high-containment laboratories, but material can be handled at a lower containment level after inactivation.

Current research is still unclear on whether this protein is synthesized, but further investigations are still warranted. Herein, this study uses multiple bioinformatic tools to biochemically and functionally characterize the ORF10 protein, along with predicting its tertiary structure. Results indicate a highly ordered, hydrophobic, and thermally stable protein that contains at least one transmembrane region. This protein also possesses high residue protein-binding propensity, primarily in the N-terminal half. An assessment of forty-one missense mutations reveal slight changes in residue flexibility, mainly in the C-terminal half. However, these same mutations do not inflict significant changes on protein stability and other biochemical features. The predicted model suggests the ORF10 protein contains a {beta}--{beta} motif with a {beta}-molecular recognition feature occurring in the first {beta}-strand. Functionally, the ORF10 protein could be a membrane protein. A single pocket was identified in this protein but found to possess low druggability. The ORF10 itself consists of two distinct lineages: the SARS-CoV lineage and the SARS-CoV-2 lineage. Evidence of strong positive selection (dN/dS = 4.01) and purifying selection (dN/dS = 0.713) were found within the SARS-CoV-2 lineage and SARS-CoV lineage, respectively.

A region of the Spike protein (S) of the virus, identified as the ""fusion peptide"" (FP), is liberated at its N-terminal site by a specific cleavage occurring in concert with the interaction of the receptor binding domain of the Spike. Studies have shown that penetration is enhanced by the required binding of Ca2+ ions to the FPs of corona viruses, but the mechanisms of membrane insertion and destabilization remain unclear. We have predicted the preferred positions of Ca2+ binding to the SARS-CoV-2-FP, the role of Ca2+ ions in mediating peptide-membrane interactions, the preferred mode of insertion of the Ca2+-bound SARS-CoV-2-FP and consequent effects on the lipid bilayer from extensive atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and trajectory analyses. In a systematic sampling of the interactions of the Ca2+-bound peptide models with lipid membranes SARS-CoV-2-FP penetrated the bilayer and disrupted its organization only in two modes involving different structural domains. In one, the hydrophobic residues F833/I834 from the middle region of the peptide are inserted. In the other, more prevalent mode, the penetration involves residues L822/F823 from the LLF motif which is conserved in CoV-2-like viruses, and is achieved by the binding of Ca2+ ions to the D830/D839 and E819/D820 residue pairs. FP penetration is shown to modify the molecular organization in specific areas of the bilayer, and the extent of membrane binding of the SARS-CoV-2 FP is significantly reduced in the absence of Ca2+ ions. These findings provide novel mechanistic insights regarding the role of Ca2+ in mediating SARS-CoV-2 fusion and provide a detailed structural platform to aid the ongoing efforts in rational design of compounds to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCESARS-CoV-2, the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, penetrates host cell membranes and uses viral-to-cellular membrane fusion to release its genetic material for replication. Experiments had identified a region termed ""fusion peptide"" (FP) in the Spike proteins of coronaviruses, as the spearhead in these initial processes, and suggested that Ca2+ is needed to support both functions. Absent structure and dynamics-based mechanistic information these FP functions could not be targeted for therapeutic interventions. We describe the development and determination of the missing information from analysis of extensive MD simulation trajectories, and propose specific Ca2+-dependent mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-FP membrane insertion and destabilization. These results offer a structure-specific platform to aid the ongoing efforts to use this target for the discovery and/or of inhibitors.","NA",46,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.03.410472v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.03.410472v2.full.pdf

The study focuses on understanding population specific variations attributing its high rate of infections in specific geographical regions particularly in USA. Rigorous phylogenomic network analysis of complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes (245) inferred five central clades named a (ancestral), b, c, d and e (subtype e1 & e2). The clade d & e2 were found exclusively comprising of USA. Clades were distinguished by 10 co-mutational combinations in Nsp3, ORF8, Nsp13, S, Nsp12, Nsp2 and Nsp6. Our analysis revealed that only 67.46% of SNP mutations were at amino acid level. T1103P mutation in Nsp3 was predicted to increase protein stability in 238 strains except 6 strains which were marked as ancestral type; whereas co-mutation (P409L & Y446C) in Nsp13 were found in 64 genomes from USA highlighting its 100% co-occurrence. Docking highlighted mutation (D614G) caused reduction in binding of Spike proteins with ACE2, but it also showed better interaction with TMPRSS2 receptor contributing to high transmissibility among USA strains. We also found host proteins, MYO5A, MYO5B, MYO5C had maximum interaction with viral proteins (N, S, M). Thus, blocking the internalization pathway by inhibiting MYO5 proteins which could be an effective target for COVID-19 treatment. The functional annotations of the HPI network were found to be closely associated with hypoxia and thrombotic conditions confirming the vulnerability and severity of infection. We also screened CpG islands in Nsp1 & N conferring ability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter and trigger ZAP activity inside host cell.

ImportanceIn the current study we presented a global view of mutational pattern observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission. This provided a who-infect-whom geographical model since the early pandemic. This is hitherto the most comprehensive comparative genomics analysis of full-length genomes for co-mutations at different geographical regions specially in USA strains. Compositional structural biology results suggested that mutations have balance of contrary forces effect on pathogenicity suggesting only few mutations to effective at translation level but not all. Novel HPI analysis and CpG predictions elucidates the proof of concept of hypoxia and thrombotic conditions in several patients. Thus, the current study focuses the understanding of population specific variations attributing high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections in specific geographical regions which may eventually be vital for the most severely affected countries and regions for sharp development of custom-made vindication strategies.","NA",19,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.162560v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.162560v2.full.pdf

At day 73, an E484K substitution in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) occurred, followed at day 80 by an insertion in the NTD N5 loop containing a new glycan sequon, which generated a variant completely resistant to plasma neutralization. Computational modeling predicts that the deletion and insertion in loops N3 and N5 prevent binding of neutralizing antibodies.

Monocytes are heterogeneous and characterized by three distinct subsets in humans. Classical and non-classical monocytes represent the most abundant subsets, each carrying out distinct biological functions. Consequently, altered frequencies of different subsets have been associated with inflammatory conditions, such as infections and autoimmune disorders including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and, more recently, COVID-19. Dissecting the contribution of different monocyte subsets to disease is currently limited by samples and cohorts, often resulting in underpowered studies and, consequently, poor reproducibility. Public transcriptomes provide an alternative source of data characterized by high statistical power and real world heterogeneity. However, most transcriptome datasets profile bulk blood or tissue samples, requiring the use of in silico approaches to quantify changes in the levels of specific cell types.

Here, we integrated 853 publicly available microarray expression profiles of sorted human monocyte subsets from 45 independent studies to identify robust and parsimonious gene expression signatures, consisting of 10 genes specific to each subset. These signatures, although derived using only datasets profiling healthy individuals, maintain their accuracy independent of the disease state in an independent cohort profiled by RNA-sequencing (AUC = 1.0). Furthermore, we demonstrate that our signatures are specific to monocyte subsets compared to other immune cells such as B, T, dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells (AUC = 0.87~0.88, p<2.2e-16). This increased specificity results in estimated monocyte subset levels that are strongly correlated with cytometry-based quantification of cellular subsets (r = 0.69, p = 6.7e-4). Consequently, we show that these monocyte subset-specific signatures can be used to quantify changes in monocyte subsets levels in expression profiles from patients in clinical trials. Finally, we show that proteins encoded by our signature genes can be used in cytometry-based assays to specifically sort monocyte subsets.

In the  locked form regions associated with fusion transitions are stabilised and the RBD harbours curved lipids. The acyl chains bind a hydrophobic pocket in one RBD whilst the polar headgroups attach to an adjacent RBD of the trimer.

Briefly, full length structural model of TMPRSS2 was developed and docked against the resolved structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with directional restraints of both cleavage sites. The docking simulations showed that TMPRSS2 interacts with the two different loops of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, each containing different cleavage sites.

The 13C{beta} and backbone 13CO, 1HN, 13C and 15N nuclei were assigned by analysis of a series of 2D 1H-15N HSQC and 13C-15N CON as well as 3D HNCO, HNCA, CBCAcoNH and HncocaNH spectra. Overall, the chemical shift data confirm that this region is chiefly disordered, but contains two five-residue segments that adopt a small population of {beta}-strand structure. Whereas the region is flexible on ms/ms timescales as gauged by T1{rho} measurements, the {1H}-15N NOEs reveal a flexibility on ns/ps timescales that is midway between a fully flexible and a completely rigid chain.","NA",238,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.09.374173v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.09.374173v1.full.pdf

Readily available economical preventive measures should be immediately explored. Xylitol has been reported to reduce the severity of viral infections as well as the severity of pneumonia, and increase the survivability of animal subjects. Since pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome are potentially fatal complications of COVID-19, the present study tested the in vitro effectiveness of xylitol against SARS-CoV-2. Virus titers and LRV of SARS-CoV-2, were incubated with a single concentration of nasal spray. Toxicity was observed in the top dilution (1/10). Virus was seen below that dilution so it did not affect calculations of virus titer or LRV. After a 25-minute contact time, the nasal spray (11% Pure Xylitol, 0.85%NaCL (Saline), and 0.20% grapefruit seed extract) reduced virus from 4.2 to 1.7 log10 CCID50 per 0.1 mL, a statistically significant reduction (P<0.001) of 2.5 log10 CCID50. STEM Images obtained at the BIoCryo Laboratory revealed virus contained on the cell wall but none intra-cellular, possibly due to D-xylose (xylitol) production of glycoaminoglycans decoy targets. Xylitol and grapefruit seed extract are not exotic nor expensive rare high technology answers to viral epidemics. The potential in saving lives and the economies of the world by using X-GSE combination therapy should inspire large clinical trials, especially in those nations whereas the healthcare system would be dangerously compromised by the adoption of less effective and significantly more financially demanding therapies. Because there are no risk factors in using the X/GSE combination therapy, and the nasal spray is over the counter available without a prescription, and the spray allows for comfortable long term mask-wearing, adoption of this preventive anti-viral therapy should be encouraged.","NA",78,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.02.408575v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.02.408575v3.full.pdf

Here, we developed a biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) cell culture system for production of transcription and replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus-like-particles (trVLP). This trVLP expresses a reporter gene (GFP) replacing viral nucleocapsid gene (N), which is required for viral genome packaging and virion assembly (SARS-CoV-2-GFP/{Delta}N trVLP). The complete viral life cycle can be achieved and exclusively confined in the cells ectopically expressing SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, but not MERS-CoV N. Genetic recombination of N supplied in trans into viral genome was not detected, as evidenced by sequence analysis after one-month serial passages in the N-expressing cells. Moreover, intein-mediated protein trans-splicing approach was utilized to split the viral N gene into two independent vectors, and the ligated viral N protein could function in trans to recapitulate entire viral life cycle, further securing the biosafety of this cell culture model. Based on this BSL-2 SARS-CoV-2 cell culture model, we developed a 96-well format high throughput screening for antivirals discovery. We identified salinomycin, tubeimoside I, monensin sodium, lycorine chloride and nigericin sodium as potent antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Currently, the knowledge accumulated from different studies about this virus is very limited. Leveraging a wide-range of biological knowledge, such as gene on-tology and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks from other closely related species presents a vital approach to infer the molecular impact of a new species. In this paper, we propose the transferred multi-relational embedding model Bio-JOIE to capture the knowledge of gene ontology and PPI networks, which demonstrates superb capability in modeling the SARS-CoV-2-human protein interactions. Bio-JOIE jointly trains two model components. The knowledge model encodes the relational facts from the protein and GO domains into separated embedding spaces, using a hierarchy-aware encoding technique employed for the GO terms. On top of that, the transfer model learns a non-linear transformation to transfer the knowledge of PPIs and gene ontology annotations across their embedding spaces. By leveraging only structured knowledge, Bio-JOIE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in PPI type prediction on multiple species. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the potential of leveraging the learned representations on clustering proteins with enzymatic function into enzyme commission families. Finally, we show that Bio-JOIE can accurately identify PPIs between the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins, providing valuable insights for advancing research on this new disease.","NA",429,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.153692v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.153692v1.full.pdf

Since there is no therapy available that is proven as fully protective against COVID-19, a vaccine to protect against deadly COVID-19 is urgently needed. Nucleocapsid protein (N protein), is one of the most abundant proteins in coronaviruses and is a potential target for both vaccine development and point of care diagnostics. The variable mass of N protein (45 to 60 kDa), suggests the presence of post-translational modifications (PTMs), and it is critical to clearly define these PTMs to gain the structural understanding necessary for further vaccine research. There have been several reports suggesting that the N protein is phosphorylated but lacks glycosylation. Our comprehensive glycomics and glycoproteomics experiments confirm that the N protein is highly O-glycosylated and also contains significant levels of N-glycosylation. We were able to confirm the presence of O-glycans on seven sites with substantial glycan occupancy, in addition to less abundant O-glycans on four sites. We also detected N-glycans on two out of five potential N-glycosylation sites. Moreover, we were able to confirm one phosphorylation site. Recent studies have indicated that the N protein can serve as an important diagnostic marker for coronavirus disease and a major immunogen by priming protective immune responses.

In vitro aerodynamic testing demonstrated that drug loading and excipient type affected the aerosol performance of remdesivir. Remdesivir combined with optimal excipients exhibited desirable aerosol performance (up to 93.0% FPF; 0.82m MMAD). Remdesivir was amorphous after the TFF process, which benefitted drug dissolution in simulated lung fluid. TFF remdesivir formulations are stable after one-month storage at 25 {degrees}C/60%RH.

Studying the evolution and transmission patterns in different countries is crucial to implement effective strategies for disease control and prevention. In this work, we present the full genome sequence for 17 SARS-CoV-2 isolates corresponding to the earliest sampled cases in Mexico. Global and local phylogenomics, coupled with mutational analysis, consistently revealed that these viral sequences are distributed within 2 known lineages, the SARS-CoV-2 lineage A/G, containing mostly sequences from North America, and the lineage B/S containing mainly sequences from Europe. Based on the exposure history of the cases and on the phylogenomic analysis, we characterized fourteen independent introduction events. Additionally, three cases with no travel history were identified. We found evidence that two of these cases represent local transmission cases occurring in Mexico during mid-March 2020, denoting the earliest events described in the country. Within this Mexican cluster, we also identified an H49Y amino acid change in the spike protein. This mutation is a homoplasy occurring independently through time and space, and may function as a molecular marker to follow on any further spread of these viral variants throughout the country. Our results depict the general picture of the SARS-CoV-2 variants introduced at the beginning of the outbreak in Mexico, setting the foundation for future surveillance efforts.

Viruses can also spread through fusion of infected with uninfected cells. We compared the requirements of ACE2 expression, proteolytic activation, and the sensitivity to inhibitors for SARS2-S-mediated and SARS-CoV-S(SARS1-S)-mediated cell-cell fusion. SARS2-S-driven fusion was moderately increased by TMPRSS2 and strongly by ACE2, while SARS1-S-driven fusion was strongly increased by TMPRSS2 and less so by ACE2 expression. In contrast to SARS1-S, SARS2-S-mediated cell-cell fusion was efficiently activated by Batimastat-sensitive metalloproteases. Mutation of the S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site reduced effector-target-cell fusion when ACE2 or TMPRSS2 were limiting and rendered SARS2-S-driven cell-cell fusion more dependent on TMPRSS2. When both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were abundant, initial target-effector-cell fusion was unaltered compared to wt SARS2-S, but syncytia remained smaller. Mutation of the S2 site specifically abrogated activation by TMPRSS2 for both cell-cell fusion and SARS2-S-driven pseudoparticle entry but still allowed for activation by metalloproteases for cell-cell fusion and by cathepsins for particle entry. Finally, we found that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor Bromhexine was unable to reduce TMPRSS2-activated cell-cell fusion by SARS1-S and SARS2-S as opposed to the inhibitor Camostat. Paradoxically, Bromhexine enhanced cell-cell fusion in the presence of TMPRSS2, while its metabolite Ambroxol exhibited inhibitory activity in some conditions. On Calu-3 lung cells, Ambroxol weakly inhibited SARS2-S-driven lentiviral pseudoparticle entry, and both substances exhibited a dose-dependent trend towards weak inhibition of authentic SARS-CoV-2.

IMPORTANCECell-cell fusion allows the virus to infect neighboring cells without the need to produce free virus and contributes to tissue damage by creating virus-infected syncytia. Our results demonstrate that the S2 cleavage site is essential for activation by TMPRSS2 and unravel important differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, among those greater dependence of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2 expression and activation by metalloproteases for cell-cell fusion. Bromhexine, reportedly an inhibitor of TMPRSS2, is currently tested in clinical trials against coronavirus disease 2019. Our results indicate that Bromhexine enhances fusion in some conditions. We therefore caution against use of Bromhexine in higher dosage until its effects on SARS-CoV-2 spike activation are better understood. The related compound Ambroxol, which similarly to Bromhexine is clinically used as an expectorant, did not exhibit activating effects on cell-cell fusion. Both compounds exhibited weak inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection at high concentrations, which might be clinically attainable for Ambroxol.","NA",38,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.25.221135v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.25.221135v3.full.pdf

SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is an attractive candidate for vaccine, antibodies and inhibitor development because of many roles it plays in attachment, fusion and entry into the host cell. In this study, we characterized the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein by immune-informatics techniques to put forward potential B and T cell epitopes, followed by the use of epitopes in construction of a multi-epitope peptide vaccine construct (MEPVC). The MEPVC revealed robust host immune system simulation with high production of immunoglobulins, cytokines and interleukins. Stable conformation of the MEPVC with a representative innate immune TLR3 receptor was observed involving strong hydrophobic and hydrophilic chemical interactions, along with enhanced contribution from salt-bridges towards inter-molecular stability. Molecular dynamics simulation in solution aided further in interpreting strong affinity of the MEPVC for TLR3. This stability is the attribute of several vital residues from both TLR3 and MEPVC as shown by radial distribution function (RDF) and a novel analytical tool axial frequency distribution (AFD). Comprehensive binding free energies estimation was provided at the end that concluded major domination by electrostatic and minor from van der Waals.

Its efficient transmission and range of disease severity raise questions regarding the contributions of virus-receptor interactions. ACE2 is a host ectopeptidase and the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Numerous reports describe ACE2 mRNA abundance and tissue distribution; however, mRNA abundance is not always representative of protein levels. Currently, there is limited data evaluating ACE2 protein and its correlation with other SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility factors.

Materials and methodsWe systematically examined the human upper and lower respiratory tract using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry to determine receptor expression and evaluated its association with risk factors for severe COVID-19.

FindingsOur results reveal that ACE2 protein is highest within regions of the sinonasal cavity and pulmonary alveoli, sites of presumptive viral transmission and severe disease development, respectively. In the lung parenchyma, ACE2 protein was found on the apical surface of a small subset of alveolar type II cells and colocalized with TMPRSS2, a cofactor for SARS-CoV2 entry. ACE2 protein was not increased by pulmonary risk factors for severe COVID-19.

Additionally, ACE2 protein was not reduced in children, a demographic with a lower incidence of severe COVID-19.

InterpretationThese results offer new insights into ACE2 protein localization in the human respiratory tract and its relationship with susceptibility factors to COVID-19.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPrevious studies of ACE2 mRNA transcript abundance in the human respiratory tract have suggested a possible association between ACE2 expression and age, sex, and the presence of comorbidities. However, these studies have provided conflicting results, as well as a lack of protein validation. Previous ACE2 protein studies have been limited by a paucity of lung tissue samples and reports that have produced contradictory results.

Added value of this studyUsing a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry, we describe ACE2 expression in the human respiratory tract. Staining protocols were optimized and validated to show consistent apical localization and avoid non-specific staining. We show ACE2 protein is found in subsets of airway cells and is highest within regions of the sinonasal cavity and pulmonary alveoli, sites of presumptive viral transmission and severe disease development for COVID-19, respectively. We show age, sex, and comorbidities do not increase ACE2 protein expression in the human respiratory tract.

Implications of all the available evidenceACE2 protein abundance does not correlate with risk factors for severe clinical outcomes, but in some cases showed an inversed relationship. Features driving COVID-19 susceptibility and severity are complex, our data suggests factors other than ACE2 protein abundance as important determinants of clinical outcomes.",10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.102976,65,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.056127v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.056127v3.full.pdf

Singh,University of Texas Health Science Center Tyler,2020-12-21,1,cc_by,Scientific Communication And Education,"This article constructs a restricted infection rate inverse binomial-based approach to predict COVID-19 cases after a family gathering. The traditional inverse binomial (IB) model is unqualified to match the reality of COVID-19, because the data contradicts the models requirement that variance should be greater than expected value. A refined version of the IB model is a necessity to predict COVID-19 cases after family gatherings. Our refined version of an IB model is more appropriate and versatile, as it accommodates all potential data scenarios: equal, lesser, or greater variance than expected value.

Application of the approach is based on a restricted infectivity rate and methodology on Fan et al.s COVID-19 data, which exhibits two clusters of infectivity. Cluster 1 has a smaller number of primary cases and exhibits larger variance than the expected cases with a negative correlation of 28%, implying that the number of secondary cases is lesser when the number of primary cases increases and vice versa. The traditional inverse binomial (IB) model is appropriate for Cluster 1. The probability of contracting COVID-19 is estimated to be 0.13 among the primary, but is 0.75 among the secondary in Cluster 1, with a wider gap. Conversely, Cluster 2, exhibits smaller variance than the expected cases with a correlation of 79%, implying the number of primary and secondary cases increase or decrease together. Cluster 2 disqualifies the traditional IB model and demands its refined version. Probability of contracting COVID-19 is estimated to be 0.74 among the primary, but is 0.72 among the secondary in Cluster 2, with a narrower gap.

The models ability to estimate the communitys health system memory for future policies to be developed is an asset of this approach. The current hazard level to be infected with COVID-19 among the primary and secondary groups are estimable and interpretable.

Author SummaryCurrent statistical models are not able to accurately predict disease infection spread in the COVID-19 pandemic. We have applied a widely-used inverse binomial method to predict rates of infection after small gatherings, going from primary (original) cases to secondary (later) cases after family gatherings or social events, using the data from the Wuhan and Gansu provinces in China, where the virus first spread. The advantages of the proposed approach include that the models ability to estimate the communitys health system memory for future policies to be developed, as such policies might reduce COVIDs spread if not its control. In our approach, as demonstrated, the current hazard level of becoming infected with COVID-19 and the odds of contracting COVID-19 among the primary in comparison to the secondary groups are estimable and interpretable.

To explore quasispecies haplotypes and its transmission characteristics, we carried out single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing of the full-length of SARS-CoV-2 spike gene within 14 RNA samples from 2 infection clusters, covering first-to third-generation infected-patients. We observed a special quasispecies structure of SARS-CoV-2 (modeled as  One-King): one dominant haplotype (mean abundance ~70.15%) followed by numerous minor haplotypes (mean abundance < 0.10%). We not only discovered a novel dominant haplotype of F1040 but also realized that minor quasispecies were also worthy of attention. Notably, some minor haplotypes (like F1040 and currently pandemic one G614) could potentially reveal adaptive and converse into the dominant one. However, minor haplotypes exhibited a high transmission bottleneck (~6% could be stably transmitted), and the new adaptive/dominant haplotypes were likely originated from genetic variations within a host rather than transmission. The evolutionary rate was estimated as 2.68-3.86 x 10-3 per site per year, which was larger than the estimation at consensus genome level. The  One-King model and conversion event expanded our understanding of the genetic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, and explained the incomprehensible phenomenon at the consensus genome level, such as limited cumulative mutations and low evolutionary rate.

This approach is multi-tiered, beginning with compiling the theoretical protein sequences from genomic derived data. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 we begin with 496 peptides that would be produced by proteolytic digestion of the viral proteins. To eliminate peptides that would cause cross-reactivity and false positives we remove peptides from consideration that have sequence homology or similar chemical characteristics using a progressively larger database of background peptides. Using this pipeline, we can remove 47 peptides from consideration as diagnostic due to the presence of peptides derived from the human proteome. To address the complexity of the human microbiome, we describe a method to create a database of all proteins of relevant abundance in the saliva microbiome. By utilizing a protein-based approach to the microbiome we can more accurately identify peptides that will be problematic in COVID-19 studies which removes 12 peptides from consideration. To identify diagnostic peptides, another 7 peptides are flagged for removal following comparison to the proteome backgrounds of viral and bacterial pathogens of similar clinical presentation. By aligning the protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 field isolates deposited to date we can identify peptides for removal due to their presence in highly variable regions that may lead to false negatives as the pathogen evolves. We provide maps of these regions and highlight 3 peptides that should be avoided as potential diagnostic or vaccine targets. Finally, we leverage publicly deposited proteomics data from human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, as well as a second study with the closely related MERS-CoV to identify the two proteins of highest abundance in human infections. The resulting final list contains the 24 peptides most unique and diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These peptides represent the best targets for the development of antibodies are clinical diagnostics. To demonstrate one application of this we model peptide fragmentation using a deep learning tool to rapidly generate targeted LCMS assays and data processing method for detecting CoVID-19 infected patient samples.

10.1101/2020.07.01.182659,High affinity binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein enhances ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity,"Lu, J.; Sun, P. D.",Peter D. Sun,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,2020-07-01,1,cc0,Biochemistry,"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged to a global pandemic and caused significant damages to public health. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) was identified as the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. As a carboxypeptidase, ACE2 cleaves many biological substrates besides Ang II to control vasodilatation and permeability. Given the nanomolar high affinity between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we wonder how this interaction would affect the enzymatic activity of ACE2. Surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein increased ACE2 proteolytic activity ~3-10 fold when fluorogenic caspase-1 substrate and Bradykinin-analog peptides were used to characterize ACE2 activity. In addition, the enhancement was mediated by ACE2 binding of RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike. These results highlighted the altered activity of ACE2 during SARS-CoV-2 infection and would shed new lights on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and its complications for better treatments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",10.1074/jbc.RA120.015303,386,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.01.182659v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.01.182659v1.full.pdf

However, recent clinical tests could not prove that lopinavir-ritonavir therapy was an effective treatment for COVID-19. In this report, we examined the effect of lopinavir and ritonavir to the activity of the purified main protease (Mpro) protein of SARS- CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19.

Here we analyse SARS-CoV-2s related bat and pangolin Sarbecoviruses and confirm horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus, are the likely true reservoir species as their host ranges extend across Central and Southern China, and into Southeast Asia. This would explain the bat Sarbecovirus recombinants in the West and East China, trafficked pangolin infections and bat Sarbecovirus recombinants linked to Southern China, and the recently reported bat Sarbecovirses in Cambodia and Thailand. Some horseshoe bat species, such as R. affinis seem to play a more significant role in virus spread as they have larger ranges. Recent ecological disturbances as a result of changes in meat sources could explain SARS-CoV-2 transmission to humans through direct or indirect contact with infected wildlife, and subsequent emergence towards Hubei in Central China. The only way, however, of finding the animal progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the whereabouts of its close relatives, very likely capable of posing a similar threat of emergence in the human population and other animals, will be by (carefully) increasing the intensity of our sampling.","NA",50,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.22.427830v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.22.427830v2.full.pdf

Cleavage at S1/S2 is important for efficient viral entry into target cells. The insertion is absent in other CoV-s of the same clade, including SARS-CoV1 that caused the 2003 outbreak. However, an analogous insertion was present in the Spike protein of the more distant Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus MERS-CoV. We show that a crucial third arginine at the left middle position, comprising a motif RRxR is required for furin recognition in vitro, while the general motif RxxR in common with MERS-CoV is not sufficient for cleavage. Further, we describe a surprising finding that the two serines at the edges of the insert SPRRAR{downarrow}SV can be efficiently phosphorylated by proline-directed and basophilic protein kinases. Both phosphorylations switch off furins ability to cleave the site. Although phosphoregulation of secreted proteins is still poorly understood, further studies, supported by a recent report of ten in vivo phosphorylated sites in the Spike protein of SARS-CoV2, could potentially uncover important novel regulatory mechanisms for SARS-CoV2.",10.1038/s41598-020-74101-0,344,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.166900v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.166900v1.full.pdf

Here we report on the development of a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein, expressed at high levels in yeast (Pichia pastoris), as a suitable vaccine candidate against COVID-19. After introducing two modifications into the wild-type RBD gene to reduce yeast-derived hyperglycosylation and improve stability during protein expression, we show that the recombinant protein, RBD219-N1C1, is equivalent to the wild-type RBD recombinant protein (RBD219-WT) in an in vitro ACE-2 binding assay. Immunogenicity studies of RBD219-N1C1 and RBD219-WT proteins formulated with Alhydrogel(R) were conducted in mice, and, after two doses, both the RBD219-WT and RBD219-N1C1 vaccines induced high levels of binding IgG antibodies. Using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, we further showed that sera obtained after a two-dose immunization schedule of the vaccines were sufficient to elicit strong neutralizing antibody titers in the 1:1,000 to 1:10,000 range, for both antigens tested. The vaccines induced IFN-{gamma}, IL-6, and IL-10 secretion, among other cytokines. Overall, these data suggest that the RBD219-N1C1 recombinant protein, produced in yeast, is suitable for further evaluation as a human COVID-19 vaccine, in particular, in an Alhydrogel(R) containing formulation and possibly in combination with other immunostimulants.","NA",310,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.367359v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.367359v1.full.pdf

A strategy for improved drug therapy is to increase levels of endogenous reactive metabolites for selective toxicity to SARS-CoV-2 by preferential damage to the viral proteome. Key reactive metabolites producing major quantitative damage to the proteome in physiological systems are: reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the reactive glycating agent methylglyoxal (MG); cysteine residues and arginine residues are their most susceptible targets, respectively. From sequenced-based prediction of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, we found 0.8-fold enrichment or depletion of cysteine residues in functional domains of the viral proteome; whereas there was a 4.6-fold enrichment of arginine residues, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 is resistant to oxidative agents and sensitive to MG. For arginine residues of the SARS-CoV-2 predicted to be in functional domains, we examined which are activated towards modification by MG - residues with predicted or expected low pKa by neighbouring group in interactions. We found 25 such arginine residues, including 2 in the spike protein and 10 in the nucleoprotein. These sites were partially conserved in related coronaviridae: SARS-COV and MERS. Finally, we identified drugs which increase cellular MG concentration to virucidal levels: antitumor drugs with historical antiviral activity, doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Our findings provide evidence of potential vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 to inactivation by MG and a scientific rationale for repurposing of doxorubicin and paclitaxel for treatment of COVID-19 disease, providing efficacy and adequate therapeutic index may be established.",10.3389/fphar.2020.585408,55,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.029488v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.029488v2.full.pdf

We show that all three library preparation methods allow us to recover near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes with identical SNP calls. The Nextera Flex and KAPA library preparation methods gave better coverage than libraries prepared with Nextera XT, which required more reads to call the same number of genomic positions. The KAPA ligation-based approach shows the lowest levels of human contamination, but contaminating reads had no effect on the downstream analysis. We found some examples of library preparation-specific differences in minority variant calling.

We performed a whole-blood preserving single-cell analysis protocol to integrate contributions from all major cell types including neutrophils, monocytes, platelets, lymphocytes and the contents of serum. Patients with mild COVID-19 disease display a coordinated pattern of interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression across every cell population and these cells are systemically absent in patients with severe disease. Severe COVID-19 patients also paradoxically produce very high anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and have lower viral load as compared to mild disease. Examination of the serum from severe patients demonstrates that they uniquely produce antibodies with multiple patterns of specificity against interferon-stimulated cells and that those antibodies functionally block the production of the mild disease-associated ISG-expressing cells.

10.1101/2020.11.10.377366,Unification of the M/ORF3-related proteins points to a diversified role for ion conductance in pathogenesis of coronaviruses and other nidoviruses,"Tan, Y.; Schneider, T.; Shukla, P.; Chandrasekharan, M.; Aravind, L.; Zhang, D.",Dapeng Zhang,Saint Louis University,2020-11-11,1,cc_no,Microbiology,"The new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the need for a better understanding of the evolution of virus-host conflicts. ORF3a in both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are ion channels (viroporins) and involved in virion assembly and membrane budding. Using sensitive profile-based homology detection methods, we unify the SARS-CoV ORF3a family with several families of viral proteins, including ORF5 from MERS-CoVs, proteins from beta-CoVs (ORF3c), alpha-CoVs (ORF3b), most importantly, the Matrix (M) proteins from CoVs, and more distant homologs from other nidoviruses. By sequence analysis and structural modeling, we show that these viral families utilize specific conserved polar residues to constitute an ion-conducting pore in the membrane. We reconstruct the evolutionary history of these families, objectively establish the common origin of the M proteins of CoVs and Toroviruses. We show that the divergent ORF3a/ORF3b/ORF5 families represent a duplication stemming from the M protein in alpha- and beta-CoVs. By phyletic profiling of major structural components of primary nidoviruses, we present a model for their role in virion assembly of CoVs, ToroVs and Arteriviruses. The unification of diverse M/ORF3 ion channel families in a wide range of nidoviruses, especially the typical M protein in CoVs, reveal a conserved, previously under-appreciated role of ion channels in virion assembly, membrane fusion and budding. We show that the M and ORF3 are under differential evolutionary pressures; in contrast to the slow evolution of M as core structural component, the CoV-ORF3 clade is under selection for diversification, which indicates it is likely at the interface with host molecules and/or immune attack.

IMPORTANCECoronaviruses (CoVs) have become a major threat to human welfare as the causative agents of several severe infectious diseases, namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and the recently emerging human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The rapid spread, severity of these diseases, as well as the potential re-emergence of other CoV-associated diseases have imposed a strong need for a thorough understanding of function and evolution of these CoVs. By utilizing robust domain-centric computational strategies, we have established homologous relationships between many divergent families of CoV proteins, including SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a, MERS-CoV ORF5, proteins from both beta-CoVs (ORF3c) and alpha-CoVs (ORF3b), the typical CoV Matrix proteins, and many distant homologs from other nidoviruses. We present evidence that they are active ion channel proteins, and the Cov-specific ORF3 clade proteins are under selection for rapid diversification, suggesting they might have been involved in interfering host molecules and/or immune attack.","NA",460,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.10.377366v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.10.377366v1.full.pdf

An average of 13.7% and 13.0% of plasmablast-derived MAbs were reactive with virus spike glycoprotein or nucleocapsid, respectively. A subset of anti-spike (10 of 32) and over half of anti-nucleocapsid (19 of 35) antibodies cross-reacted with other betacoronaviruses tested and harboured extensive somatic mutations, indicative of an expansion of memory B cells upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fourteen of 32 anti-spike MAbs, including five anti-RBD, three anti-non-RBD S1 and six anti-S2, neutralised wild-type SARS-CoV-2 in independent assays. Anti-RBD MAbs were further grouped into four cross-inhibiting clusters, of which six antibodies from three separate clusters blocked the binding of RBD to ACE2 and five were neutralising. All ACE2-blocking anti-RBD antibodies were isolated from two patients with prolonged fever, which is compatible with substantial ACE2-blocking response in their sera.

Examples of that are flaviviruses, such as dengue virus and Zika virus that cause millions of yearly infections and spread around the globe, and coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of the current pandemic. The severity of outbreaks caused by these viruses stresses the importance of virology research in determining mechanisms to limit virus spread and to curb disease severity. Such studies require molecular tools to decipher virus-host interactions and to develop effective interventions. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of a reporter system to visualize dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2 replication in live cells. The system is based on viral protease activity causing cleavage and nuclear translocation of an engineered fluorescent protein that is expressed in the infected cells. We show the suitability of the system for live cell imaging and visualization of single infected cells as well as for screening and testing of antiviral compounds. Given the modular building blocks, the system is easy to manipulate and can be adapted to any virus encoding a protease, thus offering a high degree of flexibility.

IMPORTANCEReporter systems are useful tools for fast and quantitative visualization of viral replication and spread within a host cell population. Here we describe a reporter system that takes advantage of virus-encoded proteases that are expressed in infected cells to cleave an ER-anchored fluorescent protein fused to a nuclear localization sequence. Upon cleavage, the fluorescent protein translocates to the nucleus, allowing for rapid detection of the infected cells. Using this system, we demonstrate reliable reporting activity for two major human pathogens from the Flaviviridae and the Coronaviridae families: dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2. We apply this reporter system to live cell imaging and use it for proof-of-concept to validate antiviral activity of a nucleoside analogue.

Nevertheless, intestinal inflammation has shown an important risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and prognosis. Therefore, we investigated the effect of intestinal inflammation on the viral intestinal entry mechanisms, including ACE2, in IBD.

We collected (un)inflamed mucosal biopsies from CD (n=193) and UC (n=158) patients, and 51 matched non-IBD controls for RNA sequencing, differential gene expression and co-expression analysis. Organoids from UC patients were subjected to an inflammatory mix and processed for RNA sequencing. Transmural ileal biopsies were processed for single-cell (sc) sequencing. Publicly available colonic sc-RNA sequencing data, and microarrays from tissue pre/post anti-TNF therapy, were analyzed.

In inflamed CD ileum, ACE2 was significantly decreased compared to control ileum (p=4.6E-07), whereas colonic ACE2 expression was higher in inflamed colon of CD/UC compared to control (p=8.3E-03; p=1.9E-03). Sc-RNA sequencing confirmed this ACE2 dysregulation, and exclusive epithelial ACE2 expression. Network analyses highlighted HNF4A as key regulator of ileal ACE2, while pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon regulating factors regulated colonic ACE2. Inflammatory stimuli upregulated ACE2 in UC organoids (p=1.7E-02), not in non-IBD controls (p=9.1E-01). Anti-TNF therapy restored colonic ACE2 dysregulation in responders.

Intestinal inflammation alters SARS-CoV-2 coreceptors in the intestine, with opposing effects in ileum and colon. HNF4A, an IBD susceptibility gene, is an important upstream regulator of ACE2 in ileum, whereas interferon signaling dominates in colon. Our data support the importance of adequate control of IBD in order to reduce risk of (complicated) COVID-19.",10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjaa185,517,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.169383v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.169383v1.full.pdf

Calculations are performed across the physiological pH range to also examine the impact of pH on these interactions. Two of six spike protein s1 variations having greater electric forces at pH levels consistent with nasal secretions and significant variations in force across all five variants of ACE2. Five out of six spike protein s1 variations have relatively consistent forces at pH levels of the lung, and one spike protein s1 variant that has low potential across a wide range of pH.

Without a targeted-medicine, this disease has been causing a massive humanitarian crisis not only in terms of mortality, but also imposing a lasting damage to social life and economic progress of humankind. Therefore, an immediate therapeutic strategy needs to be intervened to mitigate this global crisis. Here, we report a novel KepTide (Knock-End Peptide) therapy that nullifies SARS-CoV2 infection. SARS-CoV2 employs its surface glycoprotein ""spike"" (S-glycoprotein) to interact with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor for its infection in host cells. Based on our in-silico-based homology modeling study validated with a recent X-ray crystallographic structure (PDB ID:6M0J), we have identified that a conserved motif of S-glycoprotein that intimately engages multiple hydrogen-bond (H-bond) interactions with ACE-2 enzyme. Accordingly, we designed a peptide, termed as ACIS (ACE-2 Inhibitory motif of Spike), that displayed significant affinity towards ACE-2 enzyme as confirmed by biochemical assays such as BLItz and fluorescence polarization assays. Interestingly, more than one biochemical modifications were adopted in ACIS in order to enhance the inhibitory action of ACIS and hence called as KEpTide. Consequently, a monolayer invasion assay, plaque assay and dual immunofluorescence analysis further revealed that KEpTide efficiently mitigated the infection of SARS-CoV2 in vitro in VERO E6 cells. Finally, evaluating the relative abundance of ACIS in lungs and the potential side-effects in vivo in mice, our current study discovers a novel KepTide therapy that is safe, stable, and robust to attenuate the infection of SARS-CoV2 virus if administered intranasally.","NA",386,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.13.337584v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.13.337584v1.full.pdf

The increased translational efficiency of the M and N genes suggests that the population of SARS-CoV-2 benefits from mutations toward favored codons, while the ORF1ab gene has slightly decreased the translational efficiency. In the coding region of the ORF1ab gene upstream of the -1 frameshift site, the decreasing of the translational efficiency has been weakening parallel to the growth of the epidemic, indicating inhibition of synthesis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and promotion of replication of the genome.

MethodsA multiplexed solid-phase chemiluminescence assay (Meso Scale Discovery) was evaluated for the simultaneous detection of IgG binding to four SARS-CoV-2 antigens and the quantification of antibody-induced ACE-2 binding inhibition (pseudo-neutralisation assay). Sensitivity was evaluated with a total of 196 COVID-19 serum samples (169 confirmed PCR positive and 27 anti-nucleocapsid IgG positive) from individuals with mild symptomatic or asymptomatic disease. Specificity was evaluated with 194 control serum samples collected from adults prior to December 2019.

ResultsThe specificity and sensitivity of the binding IgG assay was highest for S protein with a specificity of 97.4% and sensitivity of 96.2% for samples taken 14 days and 97.9% for samples taken 21 days following the onset of symptoms. IgG concentration to S and RBD correlated strongly with percentage inhibition measured by the pseudo-neutralisation assay.

Recently, an emergent SARS-CoV-2 variant (B.1.1.7) with an unusually large number of mutations had become highly contagious and wide-spreading in United Kingdom. From genome analysis, the N501Y mutation within the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2s spike protein might have enhanced the viral proteins binding with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The latter is the prelude for the virus entry into host cells. So far, the molecular mechanism of this enhanced binding is still elusive, which prevents us from assessing its effects on existing therapeutic antibodies. Using all atom molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrated that Y501 in mutated RBD can be well coordinated by Y41 and K353 in hACE2 through hydrophobic interactions, increasing the overall binding affinity between RBD and hACE2 by about 0.81 kcal/mol. We further explored how the N501Y mutation might affect the binding between a neutralizing antibody (CB6) and RBD. We expect that our work can help researchers design proper measures responding to this urgent virus mutation, such as adding a modified/new neutralizing antibody specifically targeting at this variant in the therapeutic antibody cocktail.

I.; Schneider, K. A.",Kristan  Alexander Schneider,Hochschule Mittweida,2021-01-04,1,cc_by,Immunology,"BackgroundCOVID-19 vaccines are approved, vaccination campaigns are launched, and worldwide return to normality seems within close reach. Nevertheless, concerns about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines arose, due to their fast emergency approval. In fact, the problem of antibody-dependent enhancement was raised in the context of COVID-19 vaccines.

Methods and findingsWe introduce a complex extension of the model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) to optimize vaccination strategies with regard to the onset of campaigns, vaccination coverage, vaccination schedules, vaccination rates, and efficiency of vaccines. Vaccines are not assumed to immunize perfectly. Some individuals fail to immunize, some reach only partial immunity, and - importantly - some develop antibody-dependent enhancement, which increases the likelihood of developing symptomatic and severe episodes (associated with higher case fatality) upon infection. Only a fraction of the population will be vaccinated, reflecting vaccination hesitancy or contraindications.

We parameterized the model to reflect the situation in Germany and predict increasing incidence (and prevalence) in early 2021 followed by a decline by summer. Assuming contact reductions (curfews, social distancing, etc.) to be lifted in summer, disease incidence will peak again. Fast vaccine deployment contributes to reduce disease incidence in the first quarter of 2021, and delay the epidemic outbreak after the summer season. Higher vaccination coverage results in a delayed and reduced epidemic peak. A coverage of 75% - 80% is necessary to prevent an epidemic peak without further drastic contact reductions.

ConclusionsWith the vaccine becoming available, compliance with contact reductions is likely to fade. To prevent further economic damage from COVID-19, high levels of immunization need to be reached before next years flu season, and vaccination strategies and disease management need to be flexibly adjusted. The predictive model can serve as a refined decision support tool for COVID-19 management.","NA",217,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.04.425198v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.04.425198v1.full.pdf

Coronaviruses rely on host membranes for entry, establishment of replication centers and egress. Compounds targeting cellular membrane biology and lipid biosynthetic pathways have previously shown promise as antivirals and are actively being pursued as treatments for other conditions. Here, we tested small molecule inhibitors that target membrane dynamics or lipid metabolism. Included were inhibitors of the PI3 kinase VPS34, which functions in autophagy, endocytosis and other processes; Orlistat, an inhibitor of lipases and fatty acid synthetase, is approved by the FDA as a treatment for obesity; and Triacsin C which inhibits long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetases. VPS34 inhibitors, Orlistat and Triacsin C inhibited virus growth in Vero E6 cells and in the human airway epithelial cell line Calu-3, acting at a post-entry step in the virus replication cycle.

The S-glycoprotein, which recognized as the key factor for the entry of 2019-nCov into the cell, contains two functional domains: an ACE2 receptor binding domain and a second domain necessary for fusion of the coronavirus and cell membranes. FURIN activity, exposes the binding and fusion domains, is essential for the zoonotic transmission of 2019-nCov. Moreover, it has been reported that ACE2 is likely to be the receptor for 2019-nCoV. In addition, FURIN enzyme and ACE2 receptor were expressed in airway epithelia, cardiac tissue, and enteric canals, which considered as the potential target organ of the virus. However, report about the expression of FURIN and ACE2 in oral tissues was limited.Methods In order to investigate the potential infective channel of new coronavirus in oral cavity, we analyze the expression of ACE2 and FURIN that mediate the new coronavirus entry into host cells in oral mucosa using the public single-cell sequence datasets. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining experiment was performed to confirm the expression of ACE2 and FURIN in the protein level.Results The bioinformatics results indicated the differential expression of ACE2 and FURIN on epithelial cells of different oral mucosal tissues and the proportion of FURIN-positive cells was obviously higher than that of ACE2-positive cells. IHC experiments revealed that both the ACE2-positive and FURIN-positive cells in the target tissues were mainly positioned in the epithelial layers, partly expressed in fibroblasts, which further confirm the bioinformatics results.Conclusions Based on these findings, we speculated that 2019-nCov could effectively invade oral mucosal cells though two possible routes: binding to the ACE2 receptor and fusion with cell membrane activated by FURIN protease. Our results indicated that oral mucosa tissues are susceptible to 2019-nCov, which provides valuable information for virus-prevention strategy in clinical care as well as daily life.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","NA",170,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.18.047951v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.18.047951v2.full.pdf

Overwhelmingly these viruses had mutations or deletions in ORF8, that have been associated with reduced replicative fitness of the virus [2].

A key aspect of such calibrations is whether a sufficient amount of molecular evolution has occurred over the sampling time window, that is, whether the data can be treated as having come from a measurably evolving population. Here we investigate the performance of a fully Bayesian evaluation of temporal signal (BETS) in sequence data. The method involves comparing the fit to the data of two models: a model in which the data are accompanied by the actual (heterochronous) sampling times, and a model in which the samples are constrained to be contemporaneous (isochronous). We conducted simulations under a wide range of conditions to demonstrate that BETS accurately classifies data sets according to whether they contain temporal signal or not, even when there is substantial among-lineage rate variation. We explore the behaviour of this classification in analyses of five empirical data sets: modern samples of A/H1N1 influenza virus, the bacterium Bordetella pertussis, coronaviruses from mammalian hosts, ancient DNA from Hepatitis B virus and mitochondrial genomes of dog species. Our results indicate that BETS is an effective alternative to other tests of temporal signal.

The gastrointestinal symptoms of some COVID-19 patients are underestimated. There is an urgent need to develop physiologically relevant model that can accurately reflect human response to viral infection. Here, we report the creation of a biomimetic human intestine infection model on a chip system that allows to recapitulate the intestinal injury and immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2, for the first time. The microengineered intestine-on-chip device contains human intestinal epithelium (co-cultured human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells and mucin secreting HT-29 cells) lined in upper channel and vascular endothelium (human umbilical vein endothelial cells, HUVECs) in a parallel lower channel under fluidic flow condition, sandwiched by a porous PDMS membrane coated with extracellular matrix (ECM). At day 3 post-infection of SARS-CoV-2, the intestine epithelium showed high susceptibility to viral infection and obvious morphological changes with destruction of intestinal villus, dispersed distribution of mucus secreting cells and reduced expression of tight junction (E-cadherin), indicating the destruction of mucous layer and the integrity of intestinal barrier caused by virus. Moreover, the endothelium exhibited abnormal cell morphology with disrupted expression of adherent junction protein (VE-cadherin). Transcriptional analysis revealed the abnormal RNA and protein metabolism, as well as activated immune responses in both epithelial and endothelial cells after viral infection (e.g., up-regulated cytokine genes, TNF signaling and NF-kappa B signaling-related genes). This bioengineered in vitro model system can mirror the human relevant pathophysiology and response to viral infection at the organ level, which is not possible in existing in vitro culture systems. It may provide a promising tool to accelerate our understanding of COVID-19 and devising novel therapies.","NA",568,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.277780v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.277780v1.full.pdf

J. E.",Alessia David,Imperial College London,2020-05-26,1,cc_by,Bioinformatics,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus causing mainly respiratory, but also gastrointestinal symptoms. Elucidating the molecular processes underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection, and how the genetic background of an individual is responsible for the variability in clinical presentation and severity of COVID-19 is essential in understanding this disease.

Cell infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus requires binding of its Spike (S) protein to the ACE2 cell surface protein and priming of the S by the serine protease TMPRSS2. One may expect that genetic variants leading to a defective TMPRSS2 protein can affect SARS-CoV-2 ability to infect cells. We used a range of bioinformatics methods to estimate the prevalence and pathogenicity of TMPRSS2 genetic variants in the human population, and assess whether TMPRSS2 and ACE2 are co-expressed in the intestine, similarly to what is observed in lungs.

We generated a 3D structural model of the TMPRSS2 extracellular domain using the prediction server Phyre and studied 378 naturally-occurring TMPRSS2 variants reported in the GnomAD database. One common variant, p.V160M (rs12329760), is predicted damaging by both SIFT and PolyPhen2 and has a MAF of 0.25. Valine 160 is a highly conserved residue within the SRCS domain. The SRCS is found in proteins involved in host defence, such as CD5 and CD6, but its role in TMPRSS2 remains unknown. 84 rare variants (53 missense and 31 leading to a prematurely truncated protein, cumulative minor allele frequency (MAF) 7.34x10-4) cause structural destabilization and possibly protein misfolding, and are also predicted damaging by SIFT and PolyPhen2 prediction tools. Moreover, we extracted gene expression data from the human protein atlas and showed that both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the small intestine, duodenum and colon, as well as the kidneys and gallbladder.

The implications of our study are that: i. TMPRSS2 variants, in particular p.V160M with a MAF of 0.25, should be investigated as a possible marker of disease severity and prognosis in COVID-19 and ii. in vitro validation of the co-expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in gastro-intestinal is warranted.","NA",377,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.26.116608v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.26.116608v1.full.pdf

We aimed to evaluate: (i) whether COVID-19-related preprints were favored for publication, (ii) preprinting trends and public discussion of the preprints, and (iii) the relationship between the publication topic (COVID-19-related or not) and quality issues.

MethodsManuscripts deposited at bioRxiv and medRxiv between January 1 and September 27 were assessed for the probability of publishing in peer-reviewed journals, and those published were evaluated for submission-to-acceptance time. The extent of public discussion was assessed based on Altmetric and Disqus data. The Retraction Watch Database and PubMed were used to explore the retraction of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 articles and preprints.

ResultsWith adjustment for the preprinting server and number of deposited versions, COVID-19-related preprints were more likely to be published within 120 days since the deposition of the first version (OR=2.04, 95%CI 1.87-2.23) as well as over the entire observed period (OR=1.42, 95%CI 1.33-1.52).

Currently there is no proven treatment for COVID-19 and there is an urgent need for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Coronavirus spike glycoproteins play a critical role in coronavirus entry into the host cells, as they provide host cell recognition and membrane fusion between virus and host cell. Thus, they emerged as popular and promising drug targets. Crystal structures of spike protein in its closed and open states were resolved very recently in March 2020. These structures comprise 77% of the sequence and provide almost the complete protein structure. Based on down and up positions of receptor binding domain (RBD), spike protein can be in a receptor inaccessible closed or receptor accessible open state, respectively. Starting from closed and open state crystal structures, and also 16 intermediate conformations, an extensive set of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the presence of explicit water and ions were performed. Simulations show that in its down position, RBD has significantly lower mobility compared to its up position; probably caused by the 6 interdomain salt bridges of RBD in down position compared to 3 in up position. Free energy landscapes based on MD simulations revealed a semi-open state located between closed and open states. Minimum energy pathway between down and up positions comprised a gradual salt bridge switching mechanism. Furthermore, although significantly lower than open state, ACE2 binding surface of RBD contained a partial solvent accessibility in its closed state.",10.1063/5.0011141,396,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.047324v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.047324v1.full.pdf

At a molecular level, the bottleneck for the infection is the binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein to ACE2, an enzyme exposed on human cell membranes. Several experimental structures of the ACE2:RBD complex have been made available, however they offer only a static description of the arrangements of the molecules in either the free or bound states. In order to gain a dynamic description of the binding process that is key to infection, we use molecular simulations with a coarse grained model of the RBD and ACE2. We find that binding occurs in an all-or-none way, without intermediates, and that even in the bound state, the RBD exhibits a considerably dynamic behaviour. From short equilibrium simulations started in the unbound state we provide snapshots that result in a tentative mechanism of binding.

Our observations suggest that by the time SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in late 2019, it was already pre-adapted to human transmission to an extent similar to late epidemic SARS-CoV. However, no precursors or branches of evolution stemming from a less human-adapted SARS-CoV-2-like virus have been detected. The sudden appearance of a highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 presents a major cause for concern that should motivate stronger international efforts to identify the source and prevent near future re-emergence. Any existing pools of SARS-CoV-2 progenitors would be particularly dangerous if similarly well adapted for human transmission. To look for clues regarding intermediate hosts, we analyze recent key findings relating to how SARS-CoV-2 could have evolved and adapted for human transmission, and examine the environmental samples from the Wuhan Huanan seafood market. Importantly, the market samples are genetically identical to human SARS-CoV-2 isolates and were therefore most likely from human sources. We conclude by describing and advocating for measured and effective approaches implemented in the 2002-2004 SARS outbreaks to identify lingering population(s) of progenitor virus.","NA",343,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.073262v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.073262v1.full.pdf

We find that SARS-CoV-2 gains a wide host range by binding ACE2 sites essential for ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity. Six mutations found only in rodent species immune to SARS-CoV-2 are sufficient to abolish viral binding to human and dog ACE2. This is achieved through context-dependent mutational effects (intramolecular epistasis) conserved despite ACE2 sequence divergence between species. Across mammals, this epistasis generates sequence-function diversity, but through structures all bound by SARS-CoV-2. Mutational trajectories to the mouse conformation not bound by SARS-CoV-2 are blocked, by single mutations functionally deleterious in isolation, but compensatory in combination, explaining why human polymorphisms at these sites are virtually non-existent. Closed to humans, this path was opened to rodents via permissive cardiovascular phenotypes and ancient increases to ACE2 activity, serendipitously granting SARS-CoV-2 immunity. This reveals how ancient evolutionary trajectories are linked with unprecedented phenotypes such as COVID-19 and suggests extreme caution should be taken to monitor and prevent emerging animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2.

Among these are 19 antibodies that potently neutralized the authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, 9 of which exhibited exquisite potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0.7 to 9 ng/mL. Epitope mapping showed this collection of 19 antibodies to be about equally divided between those directed to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those to the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are immunogenic. In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that are overlapping with the domains at the top of the spike. Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of one antibody targeting RBD, a second targeting NTD, and a third bridging two separate RBDs revealed recognition of the closed, ""all RBD-down"" conformation of the spike.

SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into host cells via an interaction between its Spike protein and the host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Disruption of this interaction confers potent neutralization of viral entry, providing an avenue for vaccine design and for therapeutic antibodies. Here, we develop single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) that potently disrupt the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2. By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we identified a panel of nanobodies that bind to multiple epitopes on Spike and block ACE2 interaction via two distinct mechanisms. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one exceptionally stable nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains (RBDs) locked into their inaccessible down-state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains stability and function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment.

Despite its relevance, there is scarce information about its evolutionary traces. The aim of this study was to investigate the diversification patterns of the spike for each clade of SARS-CoV-2 through different approaches.

MethodsTwo thousand and one hundred sequences representing the seven clades of the SARS-CoV-2 were included. Patterns of genetic diversifications and nucleotide evolutionary rate were estimated for the spike genomic region.

ResultsThe haplotype networks showed a star shape, where multiple haplotypes with few nucleotide differences diverge from a common ancestor. Four hundred seventy nine different haplotypes were defined in the seven analyzed clades. The main haplotype, named Hap-1, was the most frequent for clades G (54%), GH (54%), and GR (56%) and a different haplotype (named Hap-252) was the most important for clades L (63.3%), O (39.7%), S (51.7%), and V (70%). The evolutionary rate for the spike protein was estimated as 1.08 x 10-3 nucleotide substitutions/site/year. Moreover, the nucleotide evolutionary rate after nine months of pandemic was similar for each clade.

ConclusionsIn conclusion, the present evolutionary analysis is relevant since the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the target for most therapeutic candidates; besides, changes in this protein could have consequences on viral transmission, response to antivirals and efficacy of vaccines. Moreover, the evolutionary characterization of clades improves knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and deserves to be assessed in more detail since re-infection by different phylogenetic clades has been reported.",NA,368,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.24.396671v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.24.396671v1.full.pdf

We analyze the distribution of CpG dinucleotides, a pathogen-associated molecular pattern, in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We find that the CpG content, which we characterize by a force parameter that accounts for statistical constraints acting on the genome at the nucleotidic and amino-acid levels, is, on average, low compared to other pathogenic betacoronaviruses. However, the CpG force widely fluctuates along the genome, with a particularly low value, comparable to the circulating seasonal HKU1, in the spike coding region and a greater value, comparable to SARS and MERS, in the highly expressed nucleocapside coding region (N ORF), whose transcripts are relatively abundant in the cytoplasm of infected cells and present in the 3UTRs of all subgenomic RNA. This dual nature of CpG content could confer to SARS-CoV-2 the ability to avoid triggering pattern recognition receptors upon entry, while eliciting a stronger response during replication. We then investigate the evolution of synonymous mutations since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, finding a signature of CpG loss in regions with a greater CpG force. Sequence motifs preceding the CpG-loss-associated loci in the N ORF match recently identified binding patterns of the Zinc finger Anti-viral Protein. Using a model of the viral gene evolution under human host pressure, we find that synonymous mutations seem driven in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and particularly in the N ORF, by the viral codon bias, the transition-transversion bias and the pressure to lower CpG content.",10.1093/molbev/msab036,26,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.074039v4?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.074039v4.full.pdf

Transcriptograms, a Bioinformatics tool to analyze genome-wide gene expression data, allow us to define an appropriate context-dependent threshold for mechanistic relevance of gene differential expression.

However, no specific targeting molecule has been identified for detecting or treating hyperinflammation related to dysregulated macrophages in severe COVID-19. Herein, we suggest candidate targets for imaging and therapy in severe COVID-19 by analyzing single-cell RNA-sequencing data based on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of COVID-19 patients. We found that expression of SLC2A3, which can be imaged by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose, was higher in macrophages from severe COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, by integrating the surface target database and drug-target binding database with RNA-sequencing data of severe COVID-19, we identified CCR1 and FPR1 as surface and druggable targets for drug delivery as well as molecular imaging. Our results provide a resource for candidate targets in the development of specific imaging and therapy for COVID-19-related hyperinflammation.","NA",256,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.213082v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.213082v1.full.pdf

However, it may fail because successful emerging pathogens, like SARS-CoV-2, evolved strategies to counteract it. Here, we systematically assessed the impact of 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins on viral sensing, type I, II and III interferon (IFN) signaling, autophagy and inflammasome formation. Mechanistic analyses show that autophagy and type I IFN responses are effectively counteracted at different levels. For example, Nsp14 induces loss of the IFN receptor, whereas ORF3a disturbs autophagy at the Golgi/endosome interface. Comparative analyses revealed that antagonism of type I IFN and autophagy is largely conserved, except that SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15 is more potent in counteracting type I IFN than its SARS-CoV-2 ortholog. Altogether, however, SARS-CoV-2 counteracts type I IFN responses and autophagy much more efficiently than type II and III IFN signaling. Consequently, the virus is relatively resistant against exogenous IFN-/{beta} and autophagy modulation but remains highly vulnerable towards IFN-{gamma} and -{lambda} treatment. In combination, IFN-{gamma} and -{lambda} act synergistically, and drastically reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication at exceedingly low doses.

Major expansion of the marine database confirms low occurrence of shared tryptic peptides among disparate marine microorganisms, implying tractability for targeted metaproteomics.

We show that human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor5,6, ACE2. ACE2 mRNA is expressed by a subset of nociceptors that express MRGPRD mRNA suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may gain access to the nervous system through entry into neurons that form free-nerve endings at the outer-most layers of skin and luminal organs.

With over 7 million confirmed cases to date, this pandemic continues to expand, spurring research to discover vaccines and therapies. SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus responsible for this disease. It initiates entry into human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein (S). Disrupting the SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding to ACE2 with designer drugs has the potential to inhibit the virus from entering human cells, presenting a new modality for therapeutic intervention. Peptide-based binders are an attractive solution to inhibit the RBD-ACE2 interaction by adequately covering the extended protein contact interface. Using molecular dynamics simulations based on the recently solved cryo-EM structure of ACE2 in complex with SARS-CoV-2-RBD, we observed that the ACE2 peptidase domain (PD) 1 helix is important for binding SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Using automated fast-flow peptide synthesis, we chemically synthesized a 23-mer peptide fragment of the ACE2 PD 1 helix (SBP1) composed entirely of proteinogenic amino acids. Chemical synthesis of SBP1 was complete in 1.5 hours, and after work up and isolation >20 milligrams of pure material was obtained. Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) revealed that SBP1 associates with micromolar affinity to insect-derived SARS-CoV-2-RBD protein obtained from Sino Biological. Association of SBP1 was not observed to an appreciable extent to HEK cell-expressed SARS-CoV-2-RBD proteins and insect-derived variants acquired from other vendors. Moreover, competitive BLI assays showed SBP1 does not outcompete ACE2 binding to Sino Biological insect-derived SARS-CoV-2-RBD.

One priority strategy is based on drug repurposing by pursuing antiviral chemotherapy that can control transmission and prevent complications associated with covid-19. With this aim, we performed a high content screening assay for the discovery of anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds. From the 65 screened compounds, we have found four drugs capable to selectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection: brequinar, abiraterone acetate, neomycin, and the extract of Hedera helix. Brequinar and abiraterone acetate had higher inhibition potency against SARS-CoV-2 than neomycin and Hedera helix extract, respectively. Drugs with reported antiviral activity and in clinical trials for covid-19, chloroquine, ivermectin, and nitazoxanide, were also included in the screening, and the last two were found to be non-selective. We used a data mining approach to build drug-host molecules-biological function-disease networks to show in a holistic way how each compound is interconnected with host node molecules and virus infection, replication, inflammatory response, and cell apoptosis.

However, where is it origin and which animals are sensitive to cross-species transmission is unclear. The interaction of virus and cell receptor is a key determinant of host range for the novel coronavirus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is demonstrated as the primary entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 entry mediated by ACE2 of 11 different species of animals, and discovered that ACE2 of Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese horseshoe bat), Felis catus (domestic cat), Canis lupus familiaris (dog), Sus scrofa (pig), Capra hircus (goat) and especially Manis javanica (Malayan pangolin) were able to render SARS-CoV-2 entry in non-susceptible cells. This is the first report that ACE2 of Pangolin could mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry which increases the presume that SARS-CoV-2 may have a pangolin origin. However, none of the ACE2 proteins from Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (greater horseshoe bat), Gallus gallus (chicken), Notechis scutatus (mainland tiger snake), Mus musculus (house mouse) rendered SARS-CoV-2 entry. Specifically, a natural isoform of Macaca mulatta (Rhesus monkey) ACE2 with a mutation of Y217N was resistance to infection, which rises the possible impact of this type of ACE2 during monkey studies of SARS-CoV-2.

Of note, here is the first report that ACE2 of Pangolin could mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry which increases the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may have a pangolin origin.

The objective of this study was to test the ivermectin drug in a murine model of coronavirus infection using a type 2 family RNA coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV2, the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). BALB/cJ female mice were infected with 6,000 PFU of MHV-A59 (Group Infected; n=20) and immediately treated with one single dose of 500 g/kg of ivermectin (Group Infected + IVM; n=20), or were not infected and treated with PBS (Control group; n=16). Five days after infection/treatment, mice were euthanized to obtain different tissues to check general health status and infection levels. Overall results demonstrated that viral infection induces the typical MHV disease in infected animals, with livers showing severe hepatocellular necrosis surrounded by a severe lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltration associated with a high hepatic viral load (52,158 AU), while ivermectin administration showed a better health status with lower viral load (23,192 AU; p<0.05) and few livers with histopathological damage (p<0.05), not showing statistical differences with control mice (P=NS). Furthermore, serum transaminase levels (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) were significantly lower in treated mice compared to infected animals. In conclusion, ivermectin seems to be effective to diminish MHV viral load and disease in mice, being a useful model for further understanding new therapies against coronavirus diseases.","NA",264,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.02.363242v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.02.363242v1.full.pdf

The study of differentially expressed genes in case-control cohorts of patients is often the first step in understanding the details of the cells dysregulation. A further level of analysis is introduced by noticing that genes are organized in functional modules (often called pathways), thus their action and their dysregulation may be better understood by the identification of the modules most affected by the disease (aka disease modules, or active subnetworks). We describe how an algorithm based on the Core&Peel method developed originally for detecting protein complexes in PPI networks, can be adapted to detect disease modules in co-expression networks of genes.

Here we describe a stepwise engineering approach to generate a set of affinity optimized, enzymatically inactivated ACE2 variants that potently block SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells. These optimized receptor traps tightly bind the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein and prevent entry into host cells. We first computationally designed the ACE2-RBD interface using a two-stage flexible protein backbone design process that improved affinity for the RBD by up to 12-fold. These designed receptor variants were affinity matured an additional 14-fold by random mutagenesis and selection using yeast surface display. The highest affinity variant contained seven amino acid changes and bound to the RBD 170-fold more tightly than wild-type ACE2. With the addition of the natural ACE2 collectrin domain and fusion to a human Fc domain for increased stabilization and avidity, the most optimal ACE2 receptor traps neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) in the 10-100 ng/ml range. Engineered ACE2 receptor traps offer a promising route to fighting infections by SARS-CoV-2 and other ACE2-utilizing coronaviruses, with the key advantage that viral resistance would also likely impair viral entry.

Consistent with observations for SARS-CoV, a closely related coronavirus responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, early reports identify a protective role for both humoral and cell-mediated immunity for SARS CoV-2.

MethodsIn this study, we leveraged HLA-I and HLA-II T cell epitope prediction tools from RECON(R) (Real-time Epitope Computation for ONcology), our bioinformatic pipeline that was developed using proteomic profiling of individual HLA-I and HLA-II alleles to predict rules for peptide binding to a diverse set of such alleles. We applied these binding predictors to viral genomes from the Coronaviridae family, and specifically to identify SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes.

ResultsTo test the suitability of these tools to identify viral T cell epitopes, we first validated HLA-I and HLA-II predictions on Coronaviridae family epitopes deposited in the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) database. We then use our HLA-I and HLA-II predictors to identify 11,776 HLA-I and 7,991 HLA-II candidate binding peptides across all 12 open reading frames (ORFs) of SARS-CoV-2. This extensive list of identified candidate peptides is driven by the length of the ORFs and the significant number of HLA-I and HLA-II alleles that we are able to predict (74 and 83, respectively), providing over 99% coverage for the US, European and Asian populations, for both HLA-I and HLA-II. From our SARS-CoV-2 predicted peptide-HLA-I allele pairs, 368 pairs identically matched previously reported pairs in the ViPR database, originating from other forms of coronaviruses. 320 of these pairs (89.1%) had a positive MHC-binding assay result. This analysis reinforces the validity our predictions.

ConclusionsUsing this bioinformatic platform, we identify multiple putative epitopes for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells whose HLA binding properties cover nearly the entire population and thus may be effective when included in prophylactic vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to induce broad cellular immunity.",10.1186/s13073-020-00767-w,324,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.027805v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.027805v1.full.pdf

In particular, SARS-CoV-2 is currently a major threat to public health worldwide. However, no commercial vaccines against the coronaviruses that can infect humans are available. The spike (S) homotrimers bind to their receptors through the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is believed to be a major target to block viral entry. In this study, we selected Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) as models. Their RBDs were observed to adopt two different conformational states (lying or standing). Then, structural and immunological analyses were used to explore differences in the immune response with RBDs among these coronaviruses. Our results showed that more RBD-specific antibodies were induced by the S trimer with the RBD in the ""standing"" state (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) than the S trimer with the RBD in the ""lying"" state (HCoV-229E), and the affinity between the RBD-specific antibodies and S trimer was also higher in the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we found that the ability of the HCoV-229E RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies was much lower and the intact and stable S1 subunit was essential for producing efficient neutralizing antibodies against HCoV-229E. Importantly, our results reveal different vaccine strategies for coronaviruses, and S-trimer is better than RBD as a target for vaccine development in Alpha-coronavirus. Our findings will provide important implications for future development of coronavirus vaccines.

ImportanceOutbreak of coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2, poses a serious threat to global public health. Development of vaccines to prevent the coronaviruses that can infect humans has always been a top priority. Coronavirus spike (S) protein is considered as a major target for vaccine development. Currently, structural studies have shown that Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) RBDs are in lying and standing state, respectively. Here, we tested the ability of S-trimer and RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies among these coronaviruses. Our results showed that Beta-CoVs RBDs are in a standing state, and their S proteins can induce more neutralizing antibodies targeting RBD. However, HCoV-229E RBD is in a lying state, and its S protein induces a low level of neutralizing antibody targeting RBD. Our results indicate that Alpha-coronavirus is more conducive to escape host immune recognition, and also provide novel ideas for the development of vaccines targeting S protein.",10.1128/JVI.02284-20,438,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.09.141580v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.09.141580v1.full.pdf

In this study, we used our pretrained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of 2019-nCoV with an inhibitory potency with Kd < 1000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra, could be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV, although there is no real-world evidence supporting the prediction.

We used detailed phylogenetic analysis, ancestral sequence reconstruction, and in situ molecular dynamics simulations to examine the Spike-RBDs functional evolution, finding that the common ancestral virus with RaTG13, dating to at least 2013, possessed high binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor.

The MPS contained human heart muscle derived from patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells. The effect of drug response was measured using outputs that correlate with clinical measurements such as QT interval (action potential duration) and drug-biomarker pairing.

Chronic exposure to HCQ alone elicited early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and increased QT interval from day 6 onwards. AZM alone elicited an increase in QT interval from day 7 onwards and arrhythmias were observed at days 8 and 10. Monotherapy results closely mimicked clinical trial outcomes. Upon chronic exposure to HCQ and AZM polytherapy, we observed an increase in QT interval on days 4-8.. Interestingly, a decrease in arrhythmias and instabilities was observed in polytherapy relative to monotherapy, in concordance with published clinical trials. Furthermore, biomarkers, most of them measurable in patients serum, were identified for negative effects of single drug or polytherapy on tissue contractile function, morphology, and antioxidant protection.

However, the ACE2-binding domain of this virus is more similar to a coronavirus isolated from a Guangdong pangolin. In addition to this unique feature, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 (and its closely related coronaviruses) has a low CpG content. This has been postulated to be the signature of an evolutionary pressure exerted by the host antiviral protein ZAP. Here, we analyzed the sequences of a wide range of viruses using both alignment-based and alignment free approaches to investigate the origin of SARS-CoV-2 genome. Our analyses revealed a high level of similarity between the 5UTR of SARS-CoV-2 and that of the Guangdong pangolin coronavirus. This suggests bat and pangolin coronaviruses might have recombined at least twice (in the 5UTR and ACE2 binding regions) to seed the formation of SARS-CoV-2. An alternative hypothesis is that the lineage preceding SARS-CoV-2 is a yet to be sampled bat coronavirus whose ACE2 binding domain and 5UTR are distinct from other known bat coronaviruses. Additionally, we performed a detailed analysis of viral genome compositions as well as expression and RNA binding data of ZAP to show that the low CpG abundance in SARS-CoV-2 is not related to an evolutionary pressure from ZAP.","NA",100,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.23.351353v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.23.351353v2.full.pdf

In the present study we constructed the phylo-geo-network of nCOV-2019 genomes from across India to understand the viral evolution in the country. A total of 611 full length genomes were extracted from different states of India from the EpiCov repository of GISAID initiative and NCBI. Their alignment uncovered 270 parsimony informative sites. Further, 339 genomes were divided into 51 haplogroups. The network revealed the core haplogroup as that of reference sequence NC_045512.2 (Haplogroup A1) with 157 identical sequences present across 16 states. The rest were having not more than ten identical sequences across not more than three locations. Interestingly, some locations with fewer samples have more haplogroups and most haplogroups (41) are localized exclusively to any one state only, suggesting the local evolution of viruses. The two most common lineages are B6 and B1 (Pangolin) whereas clade A2a (Covidex) appears to be the most predominant in India.

Quantitative suspension array technology (qSAT) assays based on the xMAP Luminex platform overcome the limitations of rapid diagnostic tests and ELISA with their higher precision, dynamic range, throughput, miniaturization, cost-efficacy and multiplexing capacity. We developed three qSAT assays to detect IgM, IgA and IgG to a panel of eight SARS-CoV-2 antigens including spike (S), nucleoprotein (N) and membrane (M) protein constructs. The assays were optimized to minimize processing time and maximize signal to noise ratio. We evaluated the performance of the assays using 128 plasmas obtained before the COVID-19 pandemic (negative controls) and 115 plasmas from individuals with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (positive controls), of whom 8 were asymptomatic, 58 had mild symptoms and 49 were hospitalized. Pre-existing IgG antibodies recognizing N, M and S2 proteins were detected in negative controls suggestive of cross-reactive to common cold coronaviruses.

The tight links that necessarily exist between the virus as it multiplies and the metabolism of its host are systematically ignored. Here we show that the metabolism of all cells is coordinated by the availability of a core building block of the cells genome, cytidine triphosphate (CTP). This metabolite is also the key to the synthesis of the viral envelope and to the translation of its genome into proteins. This unique role explains why evolution has led to the early emergence in animals of an antiviral immunity enzyme, viperin, that synthesizes a toxic analogue of CTP. The constraints arising from this dependency guide the evolution of the virus. With this in mind, we explored the real-time experiment taking place before our eyes using probabilistic modelling approaches to the molecular evolution of the virus. We have thus followed, almost on a daily basis, the evolution of the composition of the viral genome to link it to the progeny produced over time, particularly in the form of blooms that sparked a firework of viral mutations. Some of those certainly increase the propagation of the virus. This led us to make out the critical role in this evolution of several proteins of the virus, such as its nucleocapsid N, and more generally to begin to understand how the virus ties up the host metabolism to its own benefit. A way for the virus to escape CTP-dependent control in cells would be to infect cells that are not expected to grow, such as neurons. This may account for unexpected body sites of viral development in the present epidemic.","NA",326,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.31.230607v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.31.230607v1.full.pdf

Investigations of these localized pathologies have been hindered by a lack of 3D in vitro human distal lung culture systems. Further, human distal lung stem cell identification has been impaired by quiescence, anatomic divergence from mouse and lack of lineage tracing and clonogenic culture. Here, we developed robust feeder-free, chemically-defined culture of distal human lung progenitors as organoids derived clonally from single adult human alveolar epithelial type II (AT2) or KRT5+ basal cells. AT2 organoids exhibited AT1 transdifferentiation potential, while basal cell organoids progressively developed lumens lined by differentiated club and ciliated cells. Organoids consisting solely of club cells were not observed. Upon single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), alveolar organoids were composed of proliferative AT2 cells; however, basal organoid KRT5+ cells contained a distinct ITGA6+ITGB4+ mitotic population whose proliferation segregated to a TNFRSF12Ahi subfraction. Clonogenic organoid growth was markedly enriched within the TNFRSF12Ahi subset of FACS-purified ITGA6+ITGB4+ basal cells from human lung or derivative organoids. In vivo, TNFRSF12A+ cells comprised ~10% of KRT5+ basal cells and resided in clusters within terminal bronchioles. To model COVID-19 distal lung disease, we everted the polarity of basal and alveolar organoids to rapidly relocate differentiated club and ciliated cells from the organoid lumen to the exterior surface, thus displaying the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 on the outwardly-facing apical aspect. Accordingly, basal and AT2 ""apical-out"" organoids were infected by SARS-CoV-2, identifying club cells as a novel target population. This long-term, feeder-free organoid culture of human distal lung alveolar and basal stem cells, coupled with single cell analysis, identifies unsuspected basal cell functional heterogeneity and exemplifies progenitor identification within a slowly proliferating human tissue. Further, our studies establish a facile in vitro organoid model for human distal lung infectious diseases including COVID-19-associated pneumonia.","NA",242,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.212076v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.212076v1.full.pdf

In both cases, designed sequences were optimized first in silico and then experimentally for target binding, folding and stability. Nine designs bound the RBD with affinities ranging from 100pM to 10nM, and blocked bona fide SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells with IC50 values ranging from 35 pM to 35 nM; the most potent of these -- 56 and 64 residue hyperstable proteins made using the second approach -- are roughly six times more potent on a per mass basis (IC50 ~ 0.23 ng/ml) than the best monoclonal antibodies reported thus far.

These data indicate (1) the deletion of QTQTN, at the flank of polybasic cleavage site, is likely benefit the SARS-CoV-2 replication or infection in vitro but under strong purification selection in vivo since it is rarely identified in clinical samples; (2) there could be a very efficient mechanism for deleting this region from viral genome as the variants losing 23585-23599 is commonly detected after two rounds of cell passage.

Currently, the most efficacious therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 infection is the Remdesivir (RDV), an adenine-like ribonucleotide analogue that is very efficiently incorporated by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase. Understanding why RDV is so well incorporated will facilitate development of even more effective therapeutics. Here, we have applied a high-throughput, single-molecule, magnetic-tweezers platform to study thousands of cycles of nucleotide addition by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase in the absence and presence of RDV, a Favipiravir-related analog (T-1106), and the endogenously produced ddhCTP. Our data are consistent with two parallel catalytic pathways of the replicase: a high-fidelity catalytic (HFC) state and a low-fidelity catalytic (LFC) state, the latter allowing the slow incorporation of both cognate and non-cognate nucleotides. ddhCTP accesses HFC, T-1106 accesses LFC as a non-cognate nucleotide, while RDV efficiently accesses both LFC pathway. In contrast to previous reports, we provide unequivocal evidence against RDV functioning as a chain terminator. We show that RDV incorporation transiently stalls the replicase, only appearing as termination events when traditional, gel-based assays are used. The efficiency of ddhCTP utilization by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase suggests suppression of its synthesis during infection, inspiring new therapeutic strategies. Use of this experimental paradigm will be essential to the development of therapeutic nucleotide analogs targeting polymerases.","NA",296,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.06.240325v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.06.240325v1.full.pdf

This process protects the viral RNA and is essential for its replication. Multiple viral proteins are involved in this RNA capping process including the nonstructural protein 16 (nsp16) which is an S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent 2-O-methyltransferase. Nsp16 is significantly active when in complex with another nonstructural protein, nsp10, which plays a key role in its stability and activity. Here we report the development of a fluorescence polarization (FP)-based RNA displacement assay for nsp10-nsp16 complex in 384-well format with a Z'-Factor of 0.6, suitable for high throughput screening. In this process, we purified the nsp10-nsp16 complex to higher than 95% purity and confirmed its binding to the methyl donor SAM, product of the reaction, SAH, and a common methyltransferase inhibitor, sinefungin using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC). The assay was further validated by screening a library of 1124 drug-like compounds.

Its causal agent, SARS-CoV-2, has evolved rapidly since its first emergence in December 2019. Mutations in the viral genome have critical impacts on the adaptation of viral strains to the local environment, and may alter the characteristics of viral transmission, disease manifestation, and the efficacy of treatment and vaccination. Using the complete sequences of 1,932 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we examined the genomic, geographic and temporal distributions of aged, new, and frequent mutations of SARS-CoV-2, and identified six phylogenetic clusters of the strains, which also exhibit a geographic preference in different continents. Mutations in the form of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) provide a direct interpretation for the six phylogenetic clusters. Linkage disequilibrium, haplotype structure, evolutionary process, global distribution of mutations unveiled a sketch of the mutational history. Additionally, we found a positive correlation between the average mutation count and case fatality, and this correlation had strengthened with time, suggesting an important role of SNVs on disease outcomes. This study suggests that SNVs may become an important consideration in virus detection, clinical treatment, drug design, and vaccine development to avoid target shifting, and that continued isolation and sequencing is a crucial component in the fight against this pandemic.

Significance StatementMutation is the driving force of evolution for viruses like SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19. In this study, we discovered that the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is changing rapidly from the originally isolated form. These mutations have been spreading around the world and caused more than 2.5 million of infected cases and 170 thousands of deaths. We found that fourteen frequent mutations identified in this study can characterize the six main clusters of SARS-CoV-2 strains. In addition, we found the mutation burden is positively correlated with the fatality of COVID-19 patients. Understanding mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome will provide useful insight for the design of treatment and vaccination.","NA",462,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.055863v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.055863v1.full.pdf

SARS-CoV-2 engages ACE2 as the entry receptor and employs the cellular serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for S protein priming. TMPRSS2 activity is essential for viral spread and pathogenesis in the infected host. Understanding how TMPRSS2 protein expression in the lung varies in the population could reveal important insights into differential susceptibility to influenza and coronavirus infections. Here, we systematically analyzed coding-region variants in TMPRSS2 and the eQTL variants, which may affect the gene expression, to compare the genomic characteristics of TMPRSS2 among different populations. Our findings suggest that the lung-specific eQTL variants may confer different susceptibility or response to SARS-CoV-2 infection from different populations under the similar conditions. In particular, we found that the eQTL variant rs35074065 is associated with high expression of TMPRSS2 but with a low expression of the interferon (IFN)-/{beta}-inducible gene, MX1, splicing isoform.

The genes of host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, as the major virus receptor) and interleukin (IL)-6 (a key immune-pathological factor triggering cytokine storm) were shown to evince active epigenetic evolution via histone modification and cis/trans-factors interaction across different vertebrate species. Extensive analyses revealed that ACE2 ad IL-6 genes are among a subset of non-canonical interferon-stimulated genes (non-ISGs), which have been designated recently for their unconventional responses to interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory stimuli through an epigenetic cascade. Furthermore, significantly higher positive histone modification markers and position weight matrix (PWM) scores of key cis-elements corresponding to inflammatory and IFN signaling, were discovered in both ACE2 and IL6 gene promoters across representative COVID-19-susceptible species compared to unsusceptible ones.

Artificial modification of CpG frequency is a valid approach for live attenuated vaccine development, and if this is to be applied to SARS-CoV-2, we must first understand the role CpG motifs play in regulating SARS-CoV-2 replication. Accordingly, the CpG composition of the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 genome was characterised in the context of other coronaviruses. CpG suppression amongst coronaviruses does not significantly differ according to genera of virus, but does vary according to host species and primary replication site (a proxy for tissue tropism), supporting the hypothesis that viral CpG content may influence cross-species transmission. Although SARS-CoV-2 exhibits overall strong CpG suppression, this varies considerably across the genome, and the Envelope (E) open reading frame (ORF) and ORF10 demonstrate an absence of CpG suppression. While ORF10 is only present in the genomes of a subset of coronaviruses, E is essential for virus replication. Across the Coronaviridae, E genes display remarkably high variation in CpG composition, with those of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 having much higher CpG content than other coronaviruses isolated from humans. Phylogeny indicates that this is an ancestrally-derived trait reflecting their origin in bats, rather than something selected for after zoonotic transfer.

Whether additional antiviral soluble factors exist in peripheral blood remain understudied. Herein, we detected circulating exosomes that express the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in plasma of both healthy donors and convalescent COVID-19 patients. We demonstrated that exosomal ACE2 competes with cellular ACE2 for neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. ACE2-expressing (ACE2+) exosomes blocked the binding of the viral spike (S) protein RBD to ACE2+ cells in a dose dependent manner, which was 400- to 700-fold more potent than that of vesicle-free recombinant human ACE2 extracellular domain protein (rhACE2). As a consequence, exosomal ACE2 prevented SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype virus tethering and infection of human host cells at a 50-150 fold higher efficacy than rhACE2. A similar antiviral activity of exosomal ACE2 was further demonstrated to block wild-type live SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of note, depletion of ACE2+ exosomes from COVID-19 patient plasma impaired the ability to block SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to host cells.

The use of reliable and comparable PCR assays is a cornerstone to allow use of different PCR assays depending on the local equipment. In this work, we provide a comparison of the Cobas(R) (Roche) and the RealStar(R) assay (Altona).

MethodsAssessment of the two assays was performed prospectively in three reference Parisians hospitals, using 170 clinical samples. They were tested with the Cobas(R) assay, selected to obtain a distribution of cycle threshold (Ct) as large as possible, and tested with the RealStar assay with three largely available extraction platforms: QIAsymphony (Qiagen), MagNAPure (Roche) and NucliSENS-easyMag (BioMerieux).

ResultsOverall, the agreement (positive for at least one gene) was 76%. This rate differed considerably depending on the Cobas Ct values for gene E: below 35 (n = 91), the concordance was 99%. Regarding the positive Ct values, linear regression analysis showed a determination correlation (R2) of 0.88 and the Deming regression line revealed a strong correlation with a slope of 1.023 and an intercept of -3.9. Bland-Altman analysis showed that the mean difference (Cobas(R) minus RealStar(R)) was + 3.3 Ct, with a SD of + 2.3 Ct.

ConclusionsIn this comparison, both RealStar(R) and Cobas(R) assays provided comparable qualitative results and a high correlation when both tests were positive. Discrepancies exist after 35 Ct and varied depending on the extraction system used for the RealStar(R) assay, probably due to a low viral load close to the detection limit of both assays.",10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104573,327,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.179184v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.179184v1.full.pdf

There have been multiple reports of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases following SARS-CoV-2 infections. There are several suggested mechanisms involved in the development of autoimmune diseases, including cross-reactivity (molecular mimicry). A typical workflow for discovering cross-reactive epitopes (mimotopes) starts with a sequence similarity search between protein sequences of human and a pathogen. However, sequence similarity information alone is not enough to predict cross-reactivity between proteins since proteins can share highly similar conformational epitopes whose amino acid residues are situated far apart in the linear protein sequences. Therefore, we used a hidden Markov model-based tool to identify distant viral homologs of human proteins. Also, we utilized experimentally determined and modeled protein structures of SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins to find homologous protein structures between them. Next, we predicted binding affinity (IC50) of potentially cross-reactive T-cell epitopes to 34 MHC allelic variants that have been associated with autoimmune diseases using multiple prediction algorithms. Overall, from 8,138 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we identified 3,238 potentially cross-reactive B-cell epitopes covering six human proteins and 1,224 potentially cross-reactive T-cell epitopes covering 285 human proteins. To visualize the predicted cross-reactive T-cell and B-cell epitopes, we developed a web-based application ""Molecular Mimicry Map (3M) of SARS-CoV-2"" (available at https://ahs2202.github.io/3M/). The web application enables researchers to explore potential cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 epitopes alongside custom peptide vaccines, allowing researchers to identify potentially suboptimal peptide vaccine candidates or less ideal part of a whole virus vaccine to design a safer vaccine for people with genetic and environmental predispositions to autoimmune diseases.

We show that pDC are not productively infected by SARS-CoV-2. However, they efficiently diversified into activated P1-, P2-, and P3-pDC effector subsets in response to viral stimulation. They expressed CD80, CD86, CCR7, and OX40 ligand at levels similar to influenza virus-induced activation. They rapidly produced high levels of interferon-, interferon-{lambda}1, IL-6, IP-10, and IL-8. All major aspects of SARS-CoV-2-induced pDC activation were inhibited by hydroxychloroquine. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2-induced pDC activation critically depended on IRAK4 and UNC93B1, as established using pDC from genetically deficient patients.

Overall results revealed that, SARS-CoV-2 codon usage is slightly biased similarly to other RNA viruses. Nucleotide and dinucleotide compositions displayed a bias toward A/U content in all codon positions and CpU-ended codons preference, respectively. Eight common putative preferred codons were identified, and all of them were A/U-ended (U-ended: 7, A-ended: 1). In addition, natural selection was found to be the main force structuring the codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2. However, mutation pressure and other factors such as compositional constraints and hydrophobicity had an undeniable contribution.

To date, there is lack of studies describing clinical characteristics of the population most at risk of infection. Hence, we aimed to identify clinical predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and to develop and validate a score predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection risk comparing it with unspecific surrogates.

MethodsRetrospective case/control study using administrative health-related database was carried out in Southern Italy (Campania region) among beneficiaries of Regional Health Service aged over than 30 years. For each subject with Covid-19 confirmed diagnosis (case), up to five controls were randomly matched for gender, age and municipality of residence. Odds ratios and 90% confidence intervals for associations between candidate predictors and risk of infection were estimated by means of conditional logistic regression. SARS-CoV-2 Infection Score (SIS), was developed by generating a total aggregate score obtained from assignment of a weight at each selected covariate using coefficients estimated from the model. Finally, the score was categorized by assigning increasing values from 1 to 4. SIS was validated by comparison with specific and unspecific predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsSubjects suffering from diabetes, anaemias, Parkinsons disease, mental disorders, cardiovascular and inflammatory bowel and kidney diseases showed increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similar estimates were recorded for men and women and younger and older than 65 years. Fifteen conditions significantly contributed to the SIS. As SIS value increases, risk progressively increases, being odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people with the highest SIS value (SIS=4), 1.74 times higher than those unaffected by any SIS contributing conditions (SIS=1).

Effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. We recently discovered four SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitors including boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII and GC-376 with potent antiviral activity against infectious SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. Despite the weaker enzymatic inhibition of calpain inhibitors II and XII against Mpro compared to GC-376, calpain inhibitors II and XII had more potent cellular antiviral activity. This observation promoted us to hypothesize that the cellular antiviral activity of calpain inhibitors II and XII might also involve the inhibition of cathepsin L in addition to Mpro. To test this hypothesis, we tested calpain inhibitors II and XII in the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay in Vero E6 cells and found that both compounds significantly decreased pseudoviral particle entry into cells, indicating their role in inhibiting cathepsin L. The involvement of cathepsin L was further confirmed in the drug time-of-addition experiment. In addition, we found that these four compounds not only inhibit SARS-CoV-2, but also SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, as well as human coronaviruses (CoVs) 229E, OC43, and NL63. The mechanism of action is through targeting the viral Mpro, which was supported by the thermal shift binding assay and enzymatic FRET assay. We further showed that these four compounds have additive antiviral effect when combined with remdesivir. Altogether, these results suggest that boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 are not only promising antiviral drug candidates against existing human coronaviruses, but also might work against future emerging CoVs.","NA",257,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.362335v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.362335v1.full.pdf

As yet, there is not an approved vaccine, as well as limited options from existing drugs for treating this disease. We hypothesized that combining drugs with independent mechanisms of action could result in synergy against SARS-CoV-2. Using in silico approaches, we prioritized 73 combinations of 32 drugs with potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 and then tested them in vitro. Overall, we identified 16 synergistic and 8 antagonistic combinations, 4 of which were both synergistic and antagonistic in a dose-dependent manner. Among the 16 synergistic cases, combinations of nitazoxanide with three other compounds (remdesivir, amodiaquine and umifenovir) were the most notable, all exhibiting significant synergy against SARS-CoV-2. The combination of nitazoxanide, an FDA-approved drug, and remdesivir, FDA emergency use authorization for the treatment of COVID-19, demonstrate a strong synergistic interaction. Notably, the combination of remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine demonstrated strong antagonism.

After reviewing the timing of the emergence of the pandemic in 2020 and the growth of governmental responses, available secondary and sources are used to highlight impacts of COVID-19 on scientific research. A bibliometric analysis is then undertaken to analyze developments in COVID-19 related scientific publications through to October of 2020 by broad trends, fields, countries, and organizations. Two publication data sources are used: PubMed and the Web of Science.

While there has been a massive absolute increase in PubMed and Web of Science papers directly focused on COVID-19 topics, especially in medical, biological science, and public health fields, this is still a relatively small proportion of publication outputs across all fields of science. Using Web of Science publication data, the paper examines the extent to which researchers across all fields of science have pivoted their research outputs to focus on topics related to COVID-19. A COVID-19 research pivot is defined as the extent to which the proportion of output in a particular research field has shifted to a focus on COVID-19 topics in 2020 (to date) compared with 2019. Significant variations are found by specific fields (identified by Web of Science Subject Categories). In a top quintile of fields, not only in medical specialties, biomedical sciences, and public health but also in subjects in social sciences and arts and humanities, there are relatively high to medium research pivots. In lower quintiles, including other subjects in science, social science, and arts and humanities, low to zero COVID-19 research pivoting is identified.

Study 1 had 52 water samples obtained ad hoc from buildings in four metropolitan locations in different states in the US and a range of building types. Study 2 had 36 water samples obtained from two buildings in one metropolitan location with matched water sample types. One of the buildings had been continuously occupied, and the other substantially vacant for approximately 3 months. All water samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing with a MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. More than 127 genera of bacteria were identified, including genera with members that are known to include more than 50 putative frank and opportunistic pathogens. While specific results varied among sample locations, 16S rRNA amplicon abundance and the diversity of bacteria were higher in water samples from unoccupied buildings than normally occupied buildings as was the abundance of sequenced amplicons of genera known to include pathogenic bacterial members. In both studies Legionella amplicon abundance was relatively small compared to the abundance of the other bacteria in the samples. Indeed, when present, the relative abundance of Legionella amplicons was lower in samples from unoccupied buildings. Legionella did not predominate in any of the water samples and were found, on average, in 9.6% of samples in Study 1 and 8.3% of samples in Study 2.

Upon cell entry, viruses gain access to all the macromolecular machinery necessary to replicate, assemble, and bud their progeny from the infected cell. By employing molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the dynamical and chemical-physical properties of viral envelopes, researchers can gain insights into key determinants of viral infection and propagation. Here, the Frontera supercomputer is leveraged for large-scale analysis of authentic viral envelopes, whose lipid compositions are complex and realistic. VMD with support for MPI is employed on the massive parallel computer to overcome previous computational limitations and enable investigation into virus biology at an unprecedented scale. The modeling and analysis techniques applied to authentic viral envelopes at two levels of particle resolution are broadly applicable to the study of other viruses, including the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

C.; Sodroski, J. G.",Joseph G. Sodroski,Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,2020-10-23,1,cc_by_nc_nd,Microbiology,"SARS-CoV-2, a betacoronavirus, is the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein trimer mediates virus entry into host cells and cytopathic effects. We studied the contribution of several S glycoprotein features to these functions, focusing on those that differ among related coronaviruses. Acquisition of the furin cleavage site by the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein decreased virus stability and infectivity, but greatly enhanced the ability to form lethal syncytia. Notably, the D614G change found in globally predominant SARS-CoV-2 strains restored infectivity, modestly enhanced responsiveness to the ACE2 receptor and susceptibility to neutralizing sera, and tightened association of the S1 subunit with the trimer. Apparently, two unique features of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, the furin cleavage site and D614G, have evolved to balance virus infectivity, stability, cytopathicity and antibody vulnerability. Although the endodomain (cytoplasmic tail) of the S2 subunit was not absolutely required for virus entry or syncytium formation, alteration of palmitoylated cysteine residues in the cytoplasmic tail decreased the efficiency of these processes. As proteolytic cleavage contributes to the activation of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, we evaluated the ability of protease inhibitors to suppress S glycoprotein function. Matrix metalloprotease inhibitors suppressed S-mediated cell-cell fusion, but not virus entry. Synergy between inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases and TMPRSS2 suggests that both proteases can activate the S glycoprotein during the process of syncytium formation. These results provide insights into SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein-host cell interactions that likely contribute to the transmission and pathogenicity of this pandemic agent.

IMPORTANCEThe development of an effective and durable SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is essential for combating the growing COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein is the main target of neutralizing antibodies elicited during virus infection or following vaccination. Knowledge of the spike glycoprotein evolution, function and interactions with host factors will help researchers to develop effective vaccine immunogens and treatments. Here we identify key features of the spike glycoprotein, including the furin cleavage site and the D614G natural mutation, that modulate viral cytopathic effects, infectivity and sensitivity to inhibition. We also identify two inhibitors of host metalloproteases that block S-mediated cell-cell fusion, which contributes to the destruction of the virus-infected cell.",10.1128/JVI.02304-20,272,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.22.351569v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.22.351569v1.full.pdf

We report here cryo-EM structures of a full-length S trimer carrying G614, which adopts three distinct prefusion conformations differing primarily by the position of one receptor-binding domain (RBD). A loop disordered in the D614 S trimer wedges between domains within a protomer in the G614 spike. This added interaction appears to prevent premature dissociation of the G614 trimer, effectively increasing the number of functional spikes and enhancing infectivity.

Molecular mimicry, manifested by structural similarity between viral and endogenous host proteins, allow viruses to harness or disrupt cellular functions including nucleic acid metabolism and modulation of immune responses. Here, we use protein structure similarity to scan for virally encoded structure mimics across thousands of catalogued viruses and hosts spanning broad ecological niches and taxonomic range, including bacteria, plants and fungi, invertebrates and vertebrates. Our survey identified over 6,000,000 instances of structural mimicry, the vast majority of which (>70%) cannot be discerned through protein sequence. The results point to molecular mimicry as a pervasive strategy employed by viruses and indicate that the protein structure space used by a given virus is dictated by the host proteome. Interrogation of proteins mimicked by human-infecting viruses points to broad diversification of cellular pathways targeted via structural mimicry, identifies biological processes that may underly autoimmune disorders, and reveals virally encoded mimics that may be leveraged to engineer synthetic metabolic circuits or may serve as targets for therapeutics. Moreover, the manner and degree to which viruses exploit molecular mimicry varies by genome size and nucleic acid type, with ssRNA viruses circumventing limitations of their small genomes by mimicking human proteins to a greater extent than their large dsDNA counterparts.

Therefore, the invasion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is usually prevalent in the bat population, into the human population is thought to have necessitated changes in the viral genome for efficient growth in the new environment. In the present study, to understand host-dependent changes in coronavirus genomes, we focused on the mono- and oligonucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and investigated how these compositions changed time-dependently in the human cellular environment. We also compared the oligonucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses prevalent in humans or bats to investigate the causes of changes in the host environment.

ResultsTime-series analyses of changes in the nucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed a group of mono- and oligonucleotides whose compositions changed in a common direction for all clades, even though viruses belonging to different clades should evolve independently. Interestingly, the compositions of these oligonucleotides changed towards those of coronaviruses that have been prevalent in humans for a long period and away from those of bat coronaviruses.

ConclusionsClade-independent, time-dependent changes are thought to have biological significance and should relate to viral adaptation to a new host environment, providing important clues for understanding viral host adaptation mechanisms.","NA",89,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.05.425508v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.05.425508v1.full.pdf

Antibody response was analyzed by ELISA, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) against different Spike proteins in native conformation, and a pseudovirion neutralization assay to measure the quality and function of the antibodies elicited by the different Spike antigens. All three antigens (S1+S2 ectodomain, S1 domain, and RBD) generated strong neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination induced antibody repertoire was analyzed by SARS-CoV-2 spike Genome Fragment Phage Display Libraries (SARS-CoV-2 GFPDL), which identified immunodominant epitopes in the S1, S1-RBD and S2 domains. Furthermore, these analyses demonstrated that surprisingly the RBD immunogen elicited a higher antibody titer with 5-fold higher affinity antibodies to native spike antigens compared with other spike antigens.

SARS-CoV, the agent responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, utilizes ACE2 and TMPRSS2 host molecules for viral entry. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have recently been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. Additional host molecules including ADAM17, cathepsin L, CD147, and GRP78 may also function as receptors for SARS-CoV-2.

To determine the expression and in situ localization of candidate SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory mucosa, we analyzed gene expression datasets from airway epithelial cells of 515 healthy subjects, gene promoter activity analysis using the FANTOM5 dataset containing 120 distinct sample types, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of 10 healthy subjects, immunoblots on multiple airway epithelial cell types, and immunohistochemistry on 98 human lung samples.

We demonstrate absent to low ACE2 promoter activity in a variety of lung epithelial cell samples and low ACE2 gene expression in both microarray and scRNAseq datasets of epithelial cell populations. Consistent with gene expression, rare ACE2 protein expression was observed in the airway epithelium and alveoli of human lung. We present confirmatory evidence for the presence of TMPRSS2, CD147, and GRP78 protein in vitro in airway epithelial cells and confirm broad in situ protein expression of CD147 in the respiratory mucosa.

Collectively, our data suggest the presence of a mechanism dynamically regulating ACE2 expression in human lung, perhaps in periods of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also suggest that alternate receptors for SARS-CoV-2 exist to facilitate initial host cell infection.",10.1183/13993003.01123-2020,121,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.030742v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.030742v2.full.pdf

In this study, we demonstrate that berberine and obatoclax, two broad-spectrum antiviral compounds, are effective against multiple isolates of SARS-CoV-2. Berberine, a plant-derived alkaloid, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations and obatoclax, originally developed as an anti-apoptotic protein antagonist, was effective at sub-micromolar concentrations. Time-of-addition studies indicated that berberine acts on the late stage of the viral life cycle. In agreement, berberine mildly affected viral RNA synthesis, but strongly reduced infectious viral titers, leading to an increase in the particle-to-pfu ratio. In contrast, obatoclax acted at the early stage of the infection, in line with its activity to neutralize the acidic environment in endosomes. We assessed infection of primary human nasal epithelial cells cultured on an air-liquid interface and found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced and repressed expression of a specific set of cytokines and chemokines.

The viral spike protein S binds ACE2 on host cells to initiate molecular events that release the viral genome intracellularly. Soluble ACE2 inhibits entry of both SARS and SARS-2 coronaviruses by acting as a decoy for S binding sites, and is a candidate for therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic development. Using deep mutagenesis, variants of ACE2 are identified with increased binding to the receptor binding domain of S. Mutations are found across the interface, in the N90-glycosylation motif, and at buried sites where they are predicted to enhance local folding and presentation of the interaction epitope. When single substitutions are combined, large increases in binding can be achieved.

Despite the emerging approaches of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated permanent knock out of targeted genes, strategies targeting RNA for disruption are advantageous in the treatment of acquired metabolic disorders when permanent modification of the genome DNA is not appropriate, and RNA virus infection diseases when pathogenic DNA is not available (such as SARS-Cov-2 and MERS infections). Recently, Cas13d, a family of RNA-targeting CRISPR effectors, has been shown to accomplish robust down-regulation of cellular RNAs in mammalian cells in vitro. Among the various Cas13d subtypes, CasRx (RfxCas13d) showed the most potent RNA knockdown efficiency in HEK293T cells. However, the RNA-targeting activity of Cas13d still needs to be verified in vivo. In this study, the CasRx system was demonstrated to efficiently and functionally knock down genes related to metabolism functions, including Pten, Pcsk9 and lncLstr, in mouse hepatocytes. CasRx-mediated simultaneous knockdown of multiple genes was also achieved by sgRNA arrays, providing a useful strategy to modulate complex metabolism networks. Moreover, the AAV (adeno-associated virus)-mediated delivery of CasRx and Pcsk9 sgRNAs into mouse liver successfully decreased serum PCSK9, resulting in significant reduction of serum cholesterol levels. Importantly, CasRx-mediated knockdown of Pcsk9 is reversible and Pcsk9 could be repeatedly down-regulated, providing an effective strategy to reversibly modulate metabolic genes.

In response to the growing threat of the COVID-19 pandemic in February, 2020, the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) began issuing Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) to laboratories and commercial manufacturers for the development and implementation of diagnostic tests1. So far, the gold standard assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection is the RT-qPCR (real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction) test2. However, the authorized RT-qPCR test protocols vary widely, not only in the reagents, controls, and instruments they use, but also in the SARS-CoV-2 genes they target, what results constitute a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection, and their limit of detection (LoD). The FDA has provided a web site that lists most of the tests that have been issued EUAs, along with links to the authorization letters and summary documents describing these tests1. However, it is very challenging to use this site to compare or replicate these tests for a variety of reasons. First, at least 12 of 18 tests for EUA submissions made prior to March 31, 2020, are not listed there. To our knowledge, no EUAs have been issued for these applications. Second, the data are not standardized and are only provided as longhand prose in the summary documents. Third, some details (e.g. primer sequences) are absent from several of the test descriptions. Fourth, for tests provided by commercial manufacturers, summary documents are completely missing. To address at least the first three issues, we have developed a database, EUAdb (EUAdb.org), that holds standardized information about EUA-issued tests and is focused on RT-qPCR diagnostic tests, or ""high complexity molecular-based laboratory developed tests""1. By providing a standardized ontology and curated data in a relational architecture, we seek to facilitate comparability and reproducibility, with the ultimate goal of consistent, universal and high-quality testing nationwide. Here, we document the basics of the EUAdb data architecture and simple data queries. The source files can be provided to anyone who wants to modify the database for his/her own research purposes.

The present study is an investigation of the viral codon adaptation, ORFs stability and tRNA co-adaptation with humans. We observed that for the codon usage bias in viral ssRNA, ORFs have near values of folding free energies and codon adaptation index with mRNAs of the human housekeeping CDS. However, the correlation between the stability of the ORFs in ssRNA and CAI is stronger than the mRNA stability and CAI of HKG, suggesting a greater expression capacity of SARS-CoV-2. Mutational analysis reflects polymorphism in the virus for ORF1ab, surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein ORFs. Non-synonymous mutations have shown non-polar substitutions. Out of the twelve mutations nine are for a higher t-RNA copy number. Viruses in general have high mutation rates. To understand the chances of survival for the mutated SARS-CoV-2 we did simulation for synonymous mutations. It resulted in 50% ORFs with higher stability than their native equivalents. Thus, considering only the synonymous mutations the virus can exhibit a lot of polymorphism. Collectively our data provides new insights for SARS-CoV-2 mutations and the human t-RNA compatibility.

SignificanceSurvivability of SARS-CoV-2 in humans is essential for its spread. It has overlapping genes exhibiting a high codon optimization with humans even after a higher codon usage bias. They seem to possess cognizance for high copy number t-RNA (cognate or near-cognate) in humans, while mutating. Even though, it has been well established that native transcripts posses the highest stability, our in-silico studies show that SARS-CoV-2 under mutations give rise to ORFs with higher stability. These results significantly present the viruss ability and the credibility of survival for the mutants.

This demands novel research on the vaccine to fight against this pandemic situation, re-purposing of the existing drugs, phylogenetic analysis to identify the origin and determine the similarity with other known viruses, etc. The very preliminary task from the research community is to analyze the wide verities of existing related research articles, which is very much time-consuming in such situations where each minute counts for saving hundreds of human lives. The entire manual processing is even lower down the efficiency in mining the information. We have developed a complete automatic literature mining system that delivers efficient and fast mining from existing biomedical literature databases. With the help of modern-day deep learning algorithms, our system also delivers a summarization of important research articles that provides ease and fast comprehension of critical research articles. The system is currently scanning nearly 1,46,115,136 English words from 29,315 research articles in not greater than 1.5 seconds with multiple search keywords.

Perhaps less well known yet dangerous RNA viruses cause deadly diseases such as polio, Ebola, measles, rubella, yellow fever, dengue fever and many others. To combat a particular viral disease by diminishing its spread and number of fatal cases, effective vaccines and antivirals are indispensable. Therefore, quick access to the means of discovery of new treatments for any epidemic outbreak is of great interest and in vitro biochemical assays are the basis of drug discovery. The recent outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) demands an affordable and reliable assay for testing antivirals. Here, we developed a quick and inexpensive high-throughput fluorescent assay to test inhibitors of viral proteases. Accordingly, we employed this assay to sample inhibitors for papain-like protease from SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we validated this assay for screening inhibitors of flaviviral protease from the tick-borne encephalitis virus to emphasize a broad range of applications of our approach. This fluorescent high-throughput assay is based on fluorescent energy transfer (FRET) between two distinct fluorescent proteins (eGFP and mCherry) connected via a substrate polypeptide. When the substrate is cleaved, FRET is abolished and the change in fluorescence corresponds to reaction progress. Our data show that this assay can be used for testing the inhibitors in the 96 or 384 well plates format with robust and reproducible outcomes.","NA",444,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.27.357418v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.27.357418v1.full.pdf

Whittaker,Cornell University,2021-01-04,2,cc_no,Microbiology,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses its spike (S) protein to mediate viral entry into host cells. Cleavage of the S protein at the S1/S2 and/or S2 site(s) is associated with viral entry, which can occur at either the cell plasma membrane (early pathway) or the endosomal membrane (late pathway), depending on the cell type. Previous studies show that SARS-CoV-2 has a unique insert at the S1/S2 site that can be cleaved by furin, which appears to expand viral tropism to cells with suitable protease and receptor expression. Here, we utilize viral pseudoparticles and protease inhibitors to study the impact of the S1/S2 cleavage on infectivity. Our results demonstrate that S1/S2 pre-cleavage is essential for early pathway entry into Calu-3 cells, a model lung epithelial cell line, but not for late pathway entry into Vero E6 cells, a model cell line. The S1/S2 cleavage was found to be processed by other proteases beyond furin.

The incidence of COVID-19 is still increasing worldwide despite the summer heat and cool winter. However, little is known about seasonal stability of SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we employ Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the effect of temperature on four critical SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Our work demonstrates that the spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), Main protease (Mpro), and nonstructural protein 3 (macro X) possesses extreme thermos-stability when subjected to temperature variations rendering them attractive drug targets. Furthermore, our findings suggest that these four proteins are well adapted to habitable temperatures on earth and are largely insensitive to cold and warm climates. Furthermore, we report that the critical residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBD were less responsive to temperature variations as compared to the critical residues in SARS-CoV. As such, extreme summer and winter climates, and the transition between the two seasons, are expected to have a negligible effect on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 which will marginally suppress transmission rates until effective therapeutics are available world-wide.","NA",48,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.24.427990v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.24.427990v2.full.pdf

M.; Gunzer, M.",Vikramjeet Singh,"Institute for Experimental Immunology and Imaging, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, DE-45147 Essen, Germany",2020-06-24,1,cc_by_nc_nd,Neuroscience,"BackgroundThe newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a worldwide pandemic of human respiratory disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is the key receptor on lung epithelial cells to facilitate initial binding and infection of SARS-CoV-2. The binding to ACE2 is mediated via the spike glycoprotein present on the virus surface. Recent clinical data have demonstrated that patients suffering from stroke are particularly susceptible to severe courses of SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus forming a defined risk group. However, a mechanistic explanation for this finding is lacking. Sterile tissue injuries including stroke induce lymphocytopenia and systemic inflammation that might modulate the expression levels of surface proteins in distant organs. Whether systemic inflammation following stroke can specifically modulate ACE2 expression in the lung has not been investigated.

MethodsMice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 45 min and sacrificed after 24 h and 72 h for analysis of brain and lung tissues. Gene expression and protein levels of ACE2, ACE, IL-6 and IL1{beta} were measured by quantitative PCR and Western blot, respectively. Immune cell populations in lymphoid organs were analyzed by flow cytometry.

ResultsStrikingly, 24 h after stroke, we observed a substantial increase in the expression of ACE2 both on the transcriptional and protein levels in the lungs of MCAO mice compared to sham-operated mice. This increased expression persisted until day 3 after stroke. In addition, MCAO increased the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1{beta} in the lungs. Higher gene expression of cytokines IL-6 and IL-1{beta} was found in ischemic brain hemispheres and a reduced number of T-lymphocytes were present in the blood and spleen as an indicator of sterile tissue injury-induced immunosuppression.

ConclusionsWe demonstrate significantly augmented ACE2 levels and inflammation in murine lungs after experimental stroke. These pre-clinical findings might explain the clinical observation that patients with pre-existing stroke represent a high-risk group for the development of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our studies call for further investigations into the underlying signaling mechanisms and possible therapeutic interventions.

Presently there are more than 800 COVID-19 clinical trials globally, many with drug combinations, resulting in an empirical process with an enormous number of possible combinations. To identify the most promising potential therapies, we developed a biophysical model for the SARS-CoV-2 viral cycle and performed a sensitivity analysis for individual model parameters and all possible pairwise parameter changes (162 = 256 possibilities). We found that model-predicted virion production is fairly insensitive to changes in most viral entry, assembly, and release parameters, but highly sensitive to some viral transcription and translation parameters. Furthermore, we found a cooperative benefit to pairwise targeting of transcription and translation, predicting that combined targeting of these processes will be especially effective in inhibiting viral production.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","NA",71,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.111237v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.111237v2.full.pdf

A.; Arditi, M.; Bahar, I.",Ivet Bahar,University of Pittsburgh,2020-05-21,1,cc_by_nc_nd,Immunology,"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly recognized condition in which children with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection present with a constellation of symptoms including hypotension, multiorgan involvement, and elevated inflammatory markers. These symptoms and the associated laboratory values strongly resemble toxic shock syndrome, an escalation of the cytotoxic adaptive immune response triggered upon the binding of pathogenic superantigens to MHCII molecules and T cell receptors (TCRs). Here, we used structure-based computational models to demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) exhibits a high-affinity motif for binding TCR, interacting closely with both the - and {beta}-chains variable domains complementarity-determining regions. The binding epitope on S harbors a sequence motif unique to SARS-CoV-2 (not present in any other SARS coronavirus), which is highly similar in both sequence and structure to bacterial superantigens. Further examination revealed that this interaction between the virus and human T cells is strengthened in the context of a recently reported rare mutation (D839Y/N/E) from a European strain of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the interfacial region includes selected residues from a motif shared between the SARS viruses from the 2003 and 2019 pandemics, which has intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-like character. These data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 S may act as a superantigen to drive the development of MIS-C as well as cytokine storm in adult COVID-19 patients, with important implications for the development of therapeutic approaches.

SignificanceAlthough children have been largely spared from severe COVID-19 disease, a rare hyperinflammatory syndrome has been described in Europe and the East Coast of the United States, termed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MISC). The symptoms and diagnostic lab values of MIS-C resemble those of toxic shock, typically caused by pathogenic superantigens stimulating excessive activation of the adaptive immune system. We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike has a sequence and structure motif highly similar to those of bacterial superantigens, and may directly bind to the T cell receptors. This sequence motif, not present in other coronaviruses, may explain the unique potential for SARS-CoV-2 to cause both MIS-C and the cytokine storm observed in adult COVID-19 patients.",10.1073/pnas.2010722117,487,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.109272v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.109272v1.full.pdf

Phylogenetic analysis identified the presence of all five reported clades 19A, 19B, 20A, 20B and 20C in the population. The analyses revealed two major routes for the introduction of the disease in India i.e. Europe and South-east Asia followed by local transmission.

The haplogroup analysis for clades showed evolution of 19A and 19B in parallel whereas the 20B and 20C appeared to evolve from 20A. Majority of the 19A and 19B clades were present in cases that migrated from Gujarat state in India suggesting it to be one of the major initial points of disease transmission in India during month of March and April.
