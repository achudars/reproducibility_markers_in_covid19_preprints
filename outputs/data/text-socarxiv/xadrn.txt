"7" "Abstract"
"8" "This manuscript is intended to highlight the important role that industrial animal agriculture has in contributing to millions of deaths worldwide from the combined health threats of pandemics, climate change, and global burden of chronic disease. One intervention, the reduction of industrial animal agriculture, could reduce both infectious and chronic diseases and improve the health of our planet. More research and policy action  is  urgently needed, particularly while the current COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to leverage political will to act."

"10" "Introduction"
"11" "The global shutdown of entire cities, states, and countries, and the commensurate  public health and  financial fallout from COVID-19 should serve to focus our collective efforts on primary prevention of global health pandemics  (1) . The  main  focus on COVID-19 has been the struggle to produce and distribute COVID-19 test kits,  inadequate  supply of  medical equipment ,  i nsufficient hospital bed capacity to keep up with the demand from an escalating number of cases , lack of infrastructure for contact tracing , and vaccine development and distribution  (1) . However, even the heroic efforts by medical professionals to prevent deaths is limited by  available  medical knowledge and treatments.  We argue that t he best public health strategy to save  the maximum number of  lives is  primary prevention strategies   that seek to prevent  people from getting ill  in the first place  ( 2- 6 ) ."
"12" "T he focus  of  p ublic health policy  should be  to  reduc e  animal to human transmission  of infectious disease  (2 ,6 ) .  COVID-19 , like most pandemic viruses,  appears to have zoonotic origins   ( 2,7-8 ).  COVID-19 and past pandemics  have been linked to  selling wild and exotic animal meat  in wet markets  (6) .  Consequently, the media stories have focused on the calls to ban wet markets.  For example,  China banned the trade and consumption of wild animals  this year . However,  a counter argument to this policy approach is that   regulation of these markets   may  have greater compliance   than bans , and m ore importantly,  s pillover of animal viruses to humans is not exclusive to wild and exotic animal wet markets  ( 5-6 ) ."
"13" "The expansion of cities brings humans closer to wild animals as we destroy their habitats to build our own ( 6,8 ). In some places, this means workers  cutting down forests for industrial farms have eaten  wild animals as food and thus expos ed  themselves and humanity to unique pathogens ( 6 ). The explosion of demand for meat also places pressure on animal environments  as vast land areas are  clear ed , like the Amazon rainforest, to be used for animal agriculture  and therefore increasing animal contact with humans  ( 6 )."
"14" "Climate Change"
"15" "Although we are currently embroiled in the COVID-19 pandemic, we are also facing another global emergency; climate change , which kills approximately 150,000 people each year  according to a report in the Proceedings of the  Nat iona l Acad emy of  Sci ence s  ( 9 ) .  A systematic review of the literature   concluded that  i ndividual food choices  are linked  with climate change ( 10 ).  The  industrial  agricultural practices associated with  breed ing , feed ing , and slaughter ing  animals release s  greenhouses into our atmosphere that trap heat and support the rising global temperature, and also provide an optimal environment for viruses to mutate and spread ( 10-12 )."
"16" "A report by the  Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production  concluded that  more land, water, and feed  is dedicated  to animals raised for food than  is dedicated   for  human  consumption  ( 6,11,13-14 ) . Globally, more water is dedicated to food animals and their feed than humans, and this water is no longer available for reuse  ( 6,14 ) . Almost a billion humans face food scarcity because we dedicate so many resources to  food animals, which are not an efficient source of calories compared to plants according to  a review of  available evidence ( 6,11,13 )."
"17" "Chronic Disease"
"18" "Poor diet has been linked to 1 in 5 deaths worldwide by the Global Bu r den of Disease Study   in part by increasing the odds of chronic  diseases such as cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, and Type 2 diabetes  ( 1 5 ) .  In fact, a recent study estimated that dietary risks from poor diet contributed to more than $143 billion in total US healthcare spending in one year (16).  Many chronic diseases we face in modern society can be prevented and some reversed with a plant-based diet of whole fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds  (17) .   There have been numerous double-blind, randomized control trials demonstrating that a plant-based diet can perform better than medical interventions to reverse chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease ( 1 7 ). If the results of these trials could be extended to a population, then  a plant-based diet has the potential to save thousands of lives  and billions of dollars  ( 16- 1 7 ).  The  standard diet of  animal-based foods is  often  codified by  government  guidelines and subsidies, but these policies could be reversed to instead incentivize  consumption of plants rather than animals .  There have been calls by scientists to renew the Paris pledge as a policy mechanism to coordinate a global reduction in animal consumption ( 1 8 )."
"19" "Conclusion"
"20" "Public  policies to incentivize plant-based diets  and reduce incentives for industrial animal agriculture  may have seemed infeasible in the past. However, the recent human and financial toll of the COVID-19 pandemic and commensurate planetary, community, and individual health benefits of reducing animal consumption strongly argue for greater attention by global leaders  ( 1,5 ) . One intervention,  moving toward  a plant-based diet  and commensurately moving away  from  industrial animal agriculture , could prevent  thousands, possibly  millions ,  of  death s  from pandemics, climate change, and chronic disease  combined  ( 6,9,16 ) . The current global  pandemic  crisis  might  have been prevented as many had warned that a modern pandemic was expected  given the zoonotic origins of past pandemics  ( 3-4,8 ).   We  advocate for  more empirical research  using a One Health approach   and global policy development to be  dedicated to examining the threat  industrial animal  agriculture has on our lives by increasing human exposure to infectious and chronic diseases  (1) . The enormous human and financial toll this pandemic has taken should open our minds and  inspire global change  toward primary prevention of global challenges  that will benefit our health  and  the environment."
