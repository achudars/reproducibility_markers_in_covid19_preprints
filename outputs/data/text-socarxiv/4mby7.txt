"13" "Abstract"
"14" "Background:  While U.S. continues to face increasing rates of COVID-19, there is concern that voting behavior during the 2020 U.S. Presidential election may contribute to additional outbreaks and infections among communities.  The purpose of the current study was to assess the impact of the spread of the COVID-19 infection and mask-wearing behavior on voting behaviors and political affiliation during the 2020 national election."
"15" "Methods:  During a two-week period from September into October 2020 ,  YouGov, in association with Saint Louis University, conducted an online  cross-sectional  survey consisting of participants that were likely to vote in Missouri in the upcoming  national election (n=931)."
"16" "The sample was stratified into two groups: those that reported always wearing a mask or face-covering in public spaces and those that did not. Individual socio-demographics and environmental factors were compared between these groups to identify significant differences according to mask-wearing patterns. Additionally, two adjusted multivariate models were constructed to determine probability of (1) reporting always wearing a mask and (2) planning on voting in-person on election day. Indicators in each model included  reported political party affiliation, and urbanicity, presence of mask mandate, and recent COVID-19 rate, respective of reported Missouri county of residence."
"17" "Results:  The sample consisted of 931 participants across Missouri that were likely to vote during the 2020 Presidential election. Among this sample, 38.5% resided in counties with a mask mandate at the time of the survey."
"18" "Individuals who reside d  in  either  suburban  or  urban counties were twice as likely to report always wearing a mask compared to rural residents.  In addition, w hile individuals from counties with a mask mandate were over twice as likely to report always wearing a mask,  county  COVID-19 infection rates  were  not  found  to be a significant predictor of mask-wearing.  Republicans and Independents were significantly less likely to report always wearing a mask.  Compared to Democrats, Republicans were 4 times ,  and Independents were 2 times ,  more likely to vote in person on election day compared to Democratic party members. These results were significant even when adjusting urbanicity, residing in a county with a mask mandate, and county COVID-19 case-rate. While urbanicity and COVID-19 infection rate were determined to not add significantly to model performance, those that lived within a county with a mask mandate were nearly 50% less likely to vote in person on election date."
"19" "Discussion :   Overall, this study identified significant relationships that  are likely to contribute to the  spread  of COVID-19.   I ndividuals who identified as Republican and Independent party members were more likely to vote in-person on election day and less likely to always wear a mask in public spaces. The interaction between political party affiliation and mask wearing highlights the concerning dichotomy within political  discourse and  highlights  an opportunity to develop novel interventions that reduce the current political division that exists within the U.S."
"20" "Background:"
"21" "The United States is currently i n the midst of  a   COVID-19  pandemic  during a   Presidential election year, with  politics  heavily   influencing public health efforts surrounding pandemic management such as perceptions   of scientific merit, uptake with recommended and in some cases mandated, health behaviors,  and ultimately health outcomes.   A lthough  many states across the country have experienced recent increases in COVID-19 rates , 1  there has been significant variability in the implementation of public health interventions, with mask mandates one of the most commonly recommended  and effective methods to reduce COVID-19 transmission , and yet polarizing, measures. 2-5  The state of Missouri does not have state-wide mask mandate, yet several counties have opted to put such ordinances into effect.  P revious studies have found that more often Americans who are both younger and older, female, Caucasian, and Democrat-leaning are more likely to wear a mask. 6,7"
"22" "Curbside voting, expanded main-in ballot allowances, extended early voting timelines,  and  mask mandates at physical voting locations are  examples of ways  state and local governments  have  tried to balance public health safety  during COVID-19  and citizens’ constitutional right to vote. However, many of these have been challenged, some up to the Supreme Court ,  under the rationale of unsubstantiated fears of voter fraud , which may have implications on how individuals plan to vote."
"23" "The COVID-19 infection has become politicized and the prevention efforts that have been  shown to be  most effective have become politicized,  with  mask wearing and mask mandates in public spaces occurring most often in democratic-led municipalities, counties, and states. 5   As voter turnout in the United States for  the 2020  Presidential election  was the highest in history , there is concern about how voting behavior will impact COVID-19 infection spread, and what communities will be most at risk. The  purpose of this  study was to understand how COVID-19 infection spread and mask-wearing behavior is associated with voting behaviors, including political affiliation,  in the 2020 national election ."
"24" "Methods:"
"25" "Over a two - week period from September into October of 2020,  YouGov , in association with Saint Louis University,  conducted a n online survey  of likely voters  in the upcoming 2020 election held national ly  in November  throughout the state of Missouri . 8   Measures included  frequency of mask wearing  in public spaces, recorded as always, sometimes ,  or never, and then   re- coded  into a binary variable ; a lways vs.  sometimes/never . Respondents also answered a three-question instrument  developed by the Pew Research Center   to identify political party affiliation,   Democrat, Republican,  or  Independent . 9   Participants were also asked how they planned to vote in the upcoming national election; in-person on election day or  early  absentee voting , the only options available in the state of Missouri .  County of residence was also recorded for each participant and used to identify and calculate the respective COVID-19 rate of each county; calculated as total new cases from October 1 through  October  15 divided by total county population per 100,000 residents. 10   Urban classification was also applied to each participant’s county of residence according to Health Resource and Services Administration (HRSA)  definition and classification system. 11  T he sample was weighted  using  propensity scoring  per   demographics and then post-stratified based on 2016 Presidential vote  choice to calculate a final participant weight ."
"26" "Weights were applied and c omparative  descriptive  analyses were conducted to assess differences  by mask-wearing dichotomous variable  using chi-square statistical testing for categorical variables and linear probability modeling for continuous variables .  Two separate logistic multivariate regression models were developed to identify probability of (1) those that always reported wearing a mask based on political party, urbanicity, and local  mask mandate  policy, and (2) those that planned to vote in-person on election day based on political party, urbanicity, and local COVID-19 case rates. Post-model diagnostic testing was completed on both models using dominance analysis of pseudo-r 2 . Reported pseudo-r 2  of adjusted models  were  calculated  as a using  residual and null deviance .  Both models were adjusted for participant weight and significance was reported within a 95% confidence interval. All analysis was completed using R 4.0 software. 12"
"27" "Results:"
"28" "Among a sample of  93 1  likely  2020  Presidential election   voters  across Missouri ,  38.5% resided in counties with a mask mandate at the time of the survey .  Chi-square tests using weighted proportions revealed  the  demographics   of sex , age, race, or income, were  not  associated with always wearing a mask. O f  those living in mask-mandate counties,   86.3 % reported always wearing a mask , which was significantly higher than the   63.9 % who reported always wearing a mask  in counties with no  mask  mandate  (p<0.001).   T hose  who reported  not always  we aring a mask   were  more likely to vote in - person on election day  than  those  who reported always wearing a mask in public ( 90.8% vs.  71.2% ,  p<0.001).   Frequency of mask-wearing  was  also  significantly associated with political party  affiliation .  Among the  72.6%  who reported always wearing a mask, 41.3%  identified as Democrat, 32.2% as Republican, and 28.1% as Independent (p<0.001).  Among Independents who reported always wearing a mask, 55.7%  planned  to vote for the  Democrat ic party  presidential candidate . Among those who did not always wear a mask,  only 12.9%  planned to vote for the Democratic presidential candidate  respectively  (p<0.001 ).  Participants who reported always wearing a mask were significantly more likely to also be from counties with lower average COVID-19 case rate (p<0.001)."
"29" "Probability of reporting always wearing a mask according to multivariate modeling is detailed in Table 2 ,  Model 1.  After controlling for urbanicity, local mask-mandate,  and county COVID-19 rate, both Republicans and I ndependents were still significantly less likely to report always wearing a mask (AOR  0.17 ,  95% CI  0.10, 0.27  and AOR 0.22, 95% CI  0.13, 0.37 , respectively). Individuals who reside in both suburban and urban counties were up to twice as likely to also report always wearing a mask compared to rural residents (AOR 1.86, 95% CI 1.81, 2.94 and AOR 2.07, 95% CI 1.36, 3.15, respectively). While  individuals from counties with a mask mandate were over twice as likely to report always wearing a mask (AOR 2.02 ,  95% CI 1.23, 3.33), COVID-19  infection rates  of county of residence was determined not to be a significant predictor of mask-wearing. Post-model diagnostics revealed no multicollinearity among  independent variables and dominance analysis revealed political  part  affiliation to be the strongest predictor compared to all other predictors."
"30" "Model 2 ,   shown  in  Table 2 ,  details factors associated with probability of those planning on voting in-person on election day . Compared to Democrats, Republicans  were   4  times more likely to vote in person on election day (AOR 4. 31 , 95% CI  2.81 ,  6 . 73 , p<0.001). Independent party affiliates  were 2 times  as likely to vote in- pers on on election day compared to D emocratic party members (AOR 2. 06 , 95% CI 1. 37 , 3. 11 , p<0.001). These results were significant even  when  adjusting  urbanicity, residing in a county with a mask mandate, and  county  COVID-19  case- rate.  While urbanicity and COVID-19  infection  rate were determined to not add significantly to model performance, those that lived within a count y with a mask mandate were nearly  50% less likely to vote in person on election date (AOR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32, 0.89). D ominance analysis reveals political party affiliation was the strongest model predictor  and no multicollinearity was detected among independent variables."
"31" "Discussion :"
"32" "Overall ,   this study  revealed  that  individuals  who identifi ed  as Republican and Independent party members  were more likely  to vote in-person on election day and less likely to always wear a mask in public spaces.  Additionally,  COVID-19 rates by county were  found   not  be  associated with  individual  mask-wearing patterns  or  factored into decisions  regarding  voting  plans ;  suggesting a sub-optimal assessment of risk by  many residents .  These  findings highlight further nuances to the management and prevention of  COVID-19 . Throughout this pandemic the patterns of response from community members have waned from one that was collective to those that are more individualistic. Th is creates more barriers to slowing down the infections that are soaring in Missouri, specifically, yet  are  likely  applicable  to  other states throughout the country."
"33" "While mask mandates have been implemented in some  cities  and counties,  mask utilization  continues to be  politically  appropriated .  A lthough   findings  determined  that  residing in counties that have implemented   mask mandates  was associated with increase d  probability of always wearing a mask , mask wearing consistency  was still divided among Democrats and Republicans .  Yet, this study also noted the rates of COVID-19 infection continue to be lower in counties with mask mandates, as noted in other regions. 5,13   This is troublesome given the estimated historic voter turnout   amidst   fewer  polling locations  resulting in long lines  and crowds  and likely to contribute to additional community COVID-19 risk."
"34" "While our study did not  identify   traditional  sociodemographic   characteristics  associated with  mask- wearing patterns , findings do  suggest that those more likely to be vulnerable  to the pandemic  are likely to prioritize engaging in prevention efforts. 2,3   Namely, this study found that Democrats  were  more  likely   to report  wear ing  a mask consistently, and more likely to plan to vote in advance of election day. These preventative behaviors undertaken to prevent COVID-19 infections suggest that individuals that identify as Republican would likely benefit from focused communication effort s  to reduce  COVID-19  infection rates ;  present ing   unique  opportunit ies  to implement  strateg ies  to more effectively  reach  this  population ."
"35" "Limitations to this study included the  recruitment  of only likely voters, it is unclear if recruitment for a different primary purpose would provide a sample with different  patterns of mask-wearing and relationship with COVID-19 experiences. This cross-sectional  study  was  conducted  over a short period of time, voting and mask-wearing patterns may change over longer periods of time and a panel design may provide greater insights to those changes."
"36" "In the context of a soaring pandemic, and no currently available pharmaceutical interventions, we are left with  mitigation  strategies focused on communication,  mask-wearing and social distancing measures to reduce the COVID-19 infection rates.   The interaction between political  party   affiliation  and  mask wearing   highlights the concerning dichotomy  within political discourse . This further supports the uptake of federal and state-level mask mandates to reduce the political division and impact on human health."
