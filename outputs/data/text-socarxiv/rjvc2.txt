Abstract
The Covid-19 pandemic has been associated with worsening mental health but it is unclear
whether this is a direct consequence of containment measures, like ‘Stay at Home’ orders, or
due to other considerations such as fear and uncertainty about becoming infected. It is also
unclear how responsive mental health is to a changing situation. Exploiting the different policy
responses to COVID-19 in England and Scotland and using a difference-in-difference analysis,
we show that easing lockdown measures significantly improves mental health in a short time
span. Additionally, we show that those with lower socioeconomic status benefit more from
relaxing the restrictions, whereas they suffered a larger deterioration in mental health where
the lockdown was extended. As lockdown measures may continue to be necessary in the future,
further efforts (both financial and mental health support) are required to minimize the
consequences of COVID-19 containment policies for mental health.

1. Introduction
There is emerging evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying policy responses
are generating a mental health crisis in Europe (Arendt et al., 2020; Banks & Xu, 2020). The
declines in mental health began during the first months of the pandemic in March-May 2020
(Banks & Xu, 2020; Pierce et al., 2020), and were concentrated among women, youth, people
with caring duties, and those reporting financial difficulties (Cheng et al., 2020; Pierce et al.,
2020 Banks & Xu, 2020).
Yet the reasons for this deterioration are debated. One potential explanation is that, in a
pandemic, mental health would deteriorate due to fear and anxiety about one’s health and wellbeing (Le & Nguyen, 2021). An alternative hypothesis is that it is not the pandemic per se but
policy responses to it – and specifically severe mobility restrictions – that trigger worsening
mental health. It is plausible that both have played a role.
Those studies that have begun to document the decline of mental health status have faced
challenges in differentiating alternative explanations. This is primarily due to the
contemporaneity of the pandemic and associated containment measures, making it difficult to
identify an appropriate ‘control’ or comparison group (Arendt et al., 2020; Banks & Xu, 2020;
Chandola et al., 2020; Pierce et al., 2020; Silverio-Murillo et al., 2020). One study documented
an association between mobility restriction policies and mental health decline, but it could not
establish causality since it lacked pre-COVID data (Devaraj & Patel, 2020). Another important
study by Brodeur et al (2020) used google search data, revealing that the timing of lockdown
policies across European countries and US states correlated positively with searches for terms
related to boredom, loneliness, worry and sadness. Armbruster & Klotzbücher (2020), using
data on calls to helplines in four German states, found that calls increased more in states where
stricter measures were taken. However, while these studies could take into account pre-COVID
trends, they lacked clinically validated measures of mental health or samples representative of
the population. Yet together these important studies do show that there clearly is a problem.
Here, we take advantage of a quasi-natural experiment created by variations in timing of policy
responses to COVID-19 in England and Scotland. Both pursued similar containment policies
during the early months of the pandemic, but began to diverge on 13 May 2020, when England
ended its ‘Stay at Home’ order, while Scotland sustained it until 29 May. Importantly for our
purposes, this happened despite similar trajectories in the COVID pandemics by the time
England eased the restrictions. By using difference-in-difference (DiD) methods, we test the

hypothesis that the relaxation of mobility restrictions while the threat of infection persists led
to recovery of mental health.
Our results show that lifting the Stay at Home improved the mental health of the population,
after a large deterioration observed following the onset of the pandemic. In particular, right
after the end of the strict lockdown, mental health bounced back in a magnitude equivalent to
34% with respect to the deterioration observed in the first months of the pandemic. Those with
lower socioeconomic status, in terms of education or financial situation, benefited more from
the end of the strict lockdown, whereas they suffered a larger decline in mental health where
the lockdown was extended. This points out that persistent lockdown policies might exacerbate
pre-existing socioeconomic inequalities in mental health.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describe the data sources and the
empirical strategy. Section 3 describes the results. Section 4 discusses the main findings and
Section 5 concludes.
2. Methods
2.1. Data
We used the UK household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), covering waves 9 (fieldwork: 20172019), 10 (2018-2020), Covid 1 (Late April 2020), Covid 2 (Late May 2020), Covid 3 (Late
June 2020) and Covid 4 (Late July 2020). This yields a final sample of 9,078 individuals (8,163
from England, and 915 from Scotland), followed over the 6 waves (see Sample Selection
Flowchart in Appendix B).
2.2. Quasi-natural experiment design
Briefly, in 23 March the UK began a countrywide lockdown under its Stay at Home order,
which only allowed people to leave home for shopping for basic goods, to obtain medical care,
to provide care to others, exercise, or travel to work when working at home was not possible
(Hale et al., 2020) . This can be seen in a parallel, sharp increase in both nations in the
Stringency Index from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (Figure 1),
which measures the strictness of the lockdown and containment policies (Hale et al., 2020).
Importantly, containment policies started to diverge on 13 May, when England ended the Stay
at Home order. This ended internal travelling restrictions, and allowed some businesses to
reopen (Hale et al., 2020). It also allowed people to use parks and socialize in public spaces

(Quinn, 2020). This corresponded to 20-point drop (i.e.: 25%) on the Stringency Index. In
contrast, Scotland maintained the Stay at Home order until 29 May, when outdoor work, noncontact outdoor leisure activities, and travelling for recreational activities were allowed
(Scotish Government, 2020).
Figure 1- Natural experiment setup

NOTES: This figure reports the evolution of the Oxford stringency index which measures the strictness of lockdown-style
closure and containment policies that restrict people’s behaviour (Hale et al., 2020). Shaded areas represent the fieldwork days
for each UKHLS survey wave. The areas between the colourful vertical lines represent the reference period for each survey
wave regarding the mental health questions. Mental health questions were framed as how the respondent was feeling “over the
last few weeks”. Then, we assumed a reference period of two weeks prior to answering the survey, so that if for wave Covid
2 the fieldwork dates were between 27/05 - 02/06, then the reference period would be 13/05 - 02/06. Important to note that
most of the interviews in Scotland at Wave 2 (68%) were carried out during the days 27-28/05 when the region was still at the
maximum level of restrictions.

As shown in Figure A8 of Appendix A, the pandemic had a fairly similar evolution across the
two nations by the time England eased the restrictions. Therefore, we argue that the decision
to end the Stay at Home order was not due to England having better COVID-19 rates than
Scotland, but rather responds to different political strategies to tackle the pandemic. Still, in

robustness checks, we control for different measures of pandemic evolution (both cases and
deaths) and our main results hold.
We take advantage of the timing of the waves of the UKHLS survey relative to the difference
in restrictions by UK region. In Covid survey wave 1, both England and Scotland were at the
highest level of restriction, whereas by Covid survey wave 2 England had eased the restrictions
while Scotland was still at the highest level of restrictions (Figure 1). We also test whether
people actually complied with the lockdown measures by using Google mobility data and
confirm that this was indeed the case (Figure A7 in Appendix A). Individuals in England
relatively increased their mobility vis-à-vis transit, work or parks, and reduced residential time
after England eased restrictions, coinciding with the Covid Survey wave 2. This supports our
natural experiment setting.
2.3. Statistical analysis
We use a difference-in-difference model, including individual fixed effects, as follows:
𝐺𝐻𝑄𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑊𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑡 + 𝛽2 (𝐸𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖 𝑥 𝑊𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑡 ) + 𝑋𝑖𝑡 𝛾 + 𝛼𝑖 + 𝜇𝑖,𝑡

- Equation 1

where 𝐸𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖 equals 1 if the respondent lived in England by May 2020, and zero in
Scotland2. 𝑊𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑡 includes wave fixed effects, leaving Covid Survey 1 (Late April) as the base
category. 𝑋𝑖𝑡 is a vector of available time-varying control variables including age measured as
continuous variable, and three independent dummy variables indicating whether a respondent,
(i) feels lonely often or some of the time, (ii) lives alone, and (iii) is employed. 𝛼𝑖 are individual
fixed effects that control for all individual characteristics that are fixed over time. Standard
errors are clustered at the individual level. Our coefficient of interest is included in 𝛽2 which
reports the interaction between our “treatment” variable (i.e.: England) and the wave (i.e.: time)
dummies. If the earlier easing by England from 13th of May had any impact on mental health
such interaction should come out significant at Covid survey wave 2, in late May 2020.
Additionally, in order to comply with the parallel trends assumption, the interaction coefficient
should not be significant in the waves prior to the pandemic. Otherwise, this would indicate
that mental health trends had already followed different trajectories across nations prior to the
divergence in containment policies.

2

Note that it is not necessary to include in the model the nation dummy (𝐸𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖 ) alone since it is fixed over
time and therefore will be absorbed by the individual fixed effects (𝛼𝑖 ).

The outcome variable 𝐺𝐻𝑄𝑖,𝑡 is based on the General Heath Questionnaire (GHQ-12). This
instrument has been used extensively to measure the mental health well-being of different
populations (Kashyap & Singh, 2017; Pierce et al., 2020). GHQ-12 is formed by 12 items,
measuring mental health problems on a 4-point scale (1-Not at all, 2-No more than usual, 3Rather more than usual, 4-Much more than usual)3. Following previous literature (Banks &
Xu, 2020; Chandola et al., 2020), GHQ score was measured on a Caseness scale (referred to
as “GHQ-caseness” from now on), giving a point to each dimension with a score higher than
3, so that the score varies from 0 (best mental health state) to 12 (worst mental health state).
We use inverse probability weights (IPWs) to account for attrition and non-response bias
between waves. These were created by estimating the probability of responding in all waves of
the GHQ questionnaire (i.e., taking part of the balanced sample) as a function of observable
variables at the baseline wave (i.e., wave 9): age, age squared, sex, education level, labour
market status, self-reported health status, smoking status, access to internet, region and
household income quintile. IPWs were then formed by the inverse of the predicted probability
of responding in the balanced sample. Lastly, we multiplied these weights by the crosssectional weights from the wave 9 provided by UKHLS, following the UKHLS indications
(Kaminska & Lynn, 2019). More details about the construction of these weights can be found
in Appendix C.
3. Results
In Table 1 we present Summary statistics at Covid survey wave 1 (i.e.: the wave prior to
England easing restrictions). Both England and Scotland reported similar levels of mental
health (GHQ-caseness= 2.56 in England vs 2.68 in Scotland). Our sample is also balanced
between the two nations in terms of age, gender and the time-varying control variables.

3

The 12 items of the GHQ-12 are: a- concentration, b- loss of sleep, c- playing useful role, c-capable of making
decisions, e- constantly under strain, f- problems overcoming difficulties, g- enjoy day-to-day activities, hability to face problems, i- feeling unhappy or depressed, j- losing confidence, k- believe worthless, l- general
happiness. The scale of items that are framed in a positive way (i.e.: items a, c, d, g, h, and l) is rephrased to: 1More so than usual, 2- Same as usual, 3- Less so than usual, 4- Much less capable. For the exact wording of
each item question you may see the survey questionnaire (University of Essex. Institute for Social and
Economic Research, 2020).

NOTES: Balanced sample is formed by individuals with information on mental health variables at waves 9 (2017-2019), 10 (2018-2020), Covid 1 (Late April
2020), Covid 2 (Late May 2020), Covid 3 (Late June 2020) and Covid 4 (Late July 2020)

As further shown in Figure 2-A, mental health deteriorated by a similar magnitude in both
nations following the onset of the pandemic and the UK wide Stay at Home order. However,
by late May, at Covid survey wave 2, mental health started to bounce back in England after the
end of the Stay at Home order. On the other hand, it continued to deteriorate in Scotland, until
also improving by June, after restrictions began to be eased there. From then on, it starts to
catch up with respect to England. By late July, mental health continued to improve in both
nations until almost reaching pre-pandemic levels.
The DiD results show that easing restrictions in England by mid-May significantly improved
mental health, with a reduction by 0.34 points in the GHQ-caseness score (Figure 2-B). This
accounts to a 34% reduction with respect to the first increase in GHQ-caseness observed by
April 2020, following the onset of the pandemic. Full results of the model are reported in Table
A1 of the Appendix A. The DiD coefficient remains stable, both in size and significance, when
including the time-varying factors such as employment status, living alone or loneliness,
suggesting that these factors do not mediate the relationship between lockdown policies and
mental health.

Figure 2- DiD results of the effect of easing restrictions on GHQ-caseness

NOTES: Figure A reports the weighted mean of the GHQ-caseness scale over nation and UKHLS wave. Figure B reports the
coefficients of the interaction between the England dummy and the wave dummies (β2 in model of Equation 1), leaving survey
wave Covid 1 (Late April) as base category. Full results of this model are reported in Table A1 of Appendix A.

3.1. Results by GHQ dimension
In Figure 3, we report the DiD results by the 12 dimensions of GHQ. First, it is important to
note that, looking at the coefficients, all dimensions but two seem to be affected by the
lockdown measures. In particular, the improvement in mental health as a consequence of lifting
the Stay at Home order in England seems to be driven by improvement in capability of making
decisions and the “believing yourself worthless” component.
Figure 3- DiD effect of easing lockdown by dimension of GHQ-caseness

NOTES: This figure reports the coefficients and the 95% Conficence Intervals of the interaction between the England dummy
and the Covid survey wave 2 dummy (within β2 in model of Equation 1). Each coefficient comes from a different regression
where the dependent variable is equal 1 if the correspondent GHQ dimension is equal to 3 or 4, and zero otherwise. Full results
of these regressions are reported in Table A2 of Appendix A.

3.2. Results by Socio-economic group
In Figure 4 we report the effects of easing lockdown on mental health, by age, sex and
socioeconomic group, derived from a subsample analysis of the DiD model. First, results do
not seem to differ by age group and sex. On the other hand, the easing of restrictions relatively
improved the mental health of those with lower education, but not of those with higher
education. Respondents who were economically affected by the pandemic in the first months

seem to be the most relieved by the easing of restrictions. The mental health of those suffering
an earning loss in April and those who report a bad financial situation largely improved as a
consequence of the end of the Stay at Home order in England, whereas the effect was not
significant for those who were not suffering financial difficulties.
Figure 4- DiD effect of easing lockdown by socioeconomic group. GHQ-caseness

NOTES: This figure reports the coefficients and the 95% CI of the interaction between the England dummy and the Covid
survey wave 2 dummy (within β2 in model of Equation 1). Each coefficient comes from a different regression using the
corresponding subsample of each socioeconomic group. Age groups are based on respondent age by April 2020. Full
results of these regressions are reported in Tables A3 and A4 of Appendix A. Household earning loss is based on the question
“Is your household is now earning less than in January/February 2020?”. Self-reported financial situation is based on the
question “How well would you say you yourself are managing financially these days?”; those who responded “living
comfortably” or “doing alright” were classified as Good financial situation, whereas those who responded “Just about getting
by”, “Finding it quite difficult” or “Finding it very difficult” were classified as Bad financial situation.

Looking simply at the evolution of the mean GHQ-caseness score by region and socioeconomic
group (Figures A3-A6 in Appendix A) is insightful. By April 2020, following the onset of the
pandemic and UK-wide Stay at Home order, both those with a low and high socioeconomic
status (SES) as measured by education, income or individual financial situation experienced
declines in their mental health. However, after England eased restrictions, the mental health of
people in England who were disadvantaged in these respects improved, whereas it continued

to deteriorate for their equivalents living in Scotland, who still were under the Stay at Home
order. Among the more advantaged group, however, those in both Scotland and England had
experienced improvements in their mental health by May 2020. Overall, this shows that easing
the Stay at Home order particularly benefited those who were already disadvantaged and did
so rapidly, whereas those who were advantaged started to bounce back in the longer term
independently of the level of restrictions.
3.3. Robustness checks
We carried out several robustness checks to our analysis. First, we employed alternative
measures of mental health following earlier studies (Banks & Xu, 2020): i) a Likert scale from
0 to 36 (“GHQ-likert”) and, ii) a binary indicator of whether any item has the maximum score
of 4 (“GHQ-binary”). Our results did not change (Tables A5-A11 in Appendix A).
Second, even though the trajectory of the pandemic was similar in each nation when England
opened up (although by early summer rates in England were somewhat higher in England)
(Figure A8 of Appendix A), we still carry out some robustness checks to confirm that a
differential evolution of the pandemic is not driving our results. Specifically, we alternatively
add several variables to our main model: (i) 7-day rolling average of daily cases by publish
date, (ii) 7-day rolling average of daily cases by publish date by specimen date, (iii) cumulative
number of cases, (iv) 7-day rolling average of death, and (v) cumulative number of deaths. We
use both cases and deaths since the latter might be a closer measure of the evolution of the
pandemic in the first months considering the low testing capacities at the beginning of the
pandemic. More details about these variables and how they were inserted in the model can be
found in Appendix D. As shown in Tables A12-A14 in Appendix A, our main results are robust
to the inclusion of these variables at the three mental health outcome variables (i.e.: GHQcaseness, GHQ-likert and GHQ-binary). Additionally, most of the coefficients of the variables
adjusting for the evolution of the pandemic are not statistically significant. Overall, this
supports that mental health is more sensitive to containment policies, rather than to the
evolution of the pandemic.
As discussed in the section on the natural experiment design, Scotland eased some national
restrictions 29 May, by allowing outdoor work and non-contact outdoor leisure activities, and
therefore de facto ending the Stay at Home order. As shown in Figure 1, this was in between
the fieldwork days of the Covid survey wave 2. Fieldwork days during that wave were 27 May
to 02 June, and 32% of the respondents in Scotland actually carried out the survey after the

restrictions were lifted (i.e.: 29 May to 2 June). Still, this is unlikely to affect our identification
strategy since the reference period of our variable of interest (i.e.: GHQ scores) is at least two
weeks before the date that responses were recorded (the questions were framed as how the
respondent was feeling “over the last few weeks”). Then, during most of the reference period
in Covid survey wave 2, the Stay at Home order was still in place in Scotland, but not in
England. Still, we carry out a robustness check by dropping from our estimations the 32% of
respondents in Scotland who responded to Covid survey wave 2 after the restrictions were lifted
in Scotland (i.e.: 293 out of 915 Scotland respondents of our final sample). Main results hold,
despite the drop in the sample size (Table A15 in Appendix A).
4. Discussion
In this article, we seek to ascertain the causal effect of COVID-19 containment policies on
population mental health in a quasi-natural experiment setting by comparing the policy
responses of England and Scotland. Our results show that lifting the Stay at Home order
improved mental health among the population, after a large deterioration observed following
the onset of the pandemic. Our results therefore suggest that mental health may bounce back
once strict lockdown measures are lifted, and show mental health to be more sensitive to the
imposition of containment policies than to the evolution of the pandemic itself (Le & Nguyen,
2021), at least within the range observed in these two nations. We cannot, however, assume
that this would still be the case if cases and deaths had risen to very high levels after restrictions
were removed.
The results are particularly relevant considering that when England ended the Stay at Home
order, many restrictions remained in place. Compared to Scotland, socializing in public places
was allowed, but only with one person from outside the household. Also, some businesses were
encouraged to reopen but bars, clothing and electronic stores, theatres, gyms and all leisure
facilities remained closed (UK Government, 2020). Therefore, our results indicate that lifting
the strict lockdown while still maintaining relatively strong containment measures can already
significantly ease the mental health burden of the population in a short period of time.
The deterioration of mental health following the first months of the pandemic has been reported
to be worse among younger people and women (Banks & Xu, 2020; Pierce et al., 2020).
However, our results show that easing the lockdown did not have a differential effect by age
or gender. Previous studies were inconclusive as regards pre-existing levels of disadvantage.
Some studies (Chandola et al., 2020; Etheridge & Spantig, 2020) showed that the deterioration

in mental health was greater among those in a worse financial situation, whereas Davillas and
Jones (2021) noted that the pandemic initially acted as a leveler in that it was associated with
a similar deterioration in mental health for all groups. Our results show that easing the
lockdown restrictions benefited more those already disadvantaged in terms of education and
financial difficulties. Or to put another way, those already disadvantaged suffered a larger
deterioration in mental health with the prolongation of the Stay at Home order. This suggests
that persistent lockdown policies might exacerbate pre-existing socioeconomic inequalities in
mental health.
Our paper also has some limitations. First, while we use a widely used and validated measure
of population mental health, it is not clear whether the same pattern would be seen with other
measures of mental health outcomes, such as medicine consumption or healthcare use. In fact,
healthcare contacts for mental health conditions have been shown to decrease following the
onset of the pandemic (Mansfield et al., 2021). Future research might cast light on whether the
difference in policy responses by nation also had an impact on the use of mental health care
services and whether this translates or not into differential unmet mental health needs. Second,
we focus on causal impact of easing lockdown restrictions on mental health, while leaving the
mediating factors relatively unexplored. Still, our results point towards the importance of
economic factors since those already disadvantaged and suffering financial difficulties were
most affected by the lockdown extension. On the other hand, measures of social support such
as loneliness or living alone do not seem to mediate the relationship between lockdown policies
and mental health. Further research may explore which of these two groups of factors are more
relevant to explain how lockdown policies impact mental health.
5. Conclusion
Restrictions on movement were essential to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and
may be needed again given the emergence of new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, some
potentially able to escape vaccine-induced immunity, and uncertainty surrounding vaccination
rollout. These findings should not be interpreted as supporting the removal of restrictions if it
is unsafe to do so. However, they do stress the importance of taking compensatory mechanisms
to protect those who are the most likely to suffer from these necessary restrictions. These are
people who are already disadvantaged, reminding us how the pandemic has shone a light on
the existing fractures in our society.

NOTES: Each column reports results from a different regression, where the dependent variable is the GHQ-Caseness
scale (0-12). Robust standard errors in parentheses *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. Note that the difference in
observations between the final balanced sample (n=9,079) and the sample used in the regressions (n=7,991) is due to
some survey respondents (1,088) having zero weights by sampling design (Kaminska & Lynn, 2019).

NOTES. Each column reports results from a different regression, where the dependent variable is equal 1 if the correspondent GHQ dimension is equal 3 or 4. The 12 dimensions of the
GHQ-12 are: a- concentration, b- loss of sleep, c- playing useful role, d-capable of making decisions, e- constantly under strain, f- problems overcoming difficulties, g- enjoy day-to-day
activities, h- ability to face problems, i- feeling unhappy or depressed, j- losing confidence, k- believe worthless, l- general happiness. Robust standard errors in parentheses *** p<0.01, **

NOTES: Each column reports results from a different regression, where the dependent variable is the GHQ-likert
scale (0-36). Robust standard errors in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. Note that the difference
in observations between the final balanced sample (n=9,079) and the sample used in the regressions (n=7,991) is due
to some survey respondents (1,088) having zero weights by sampling design (Kaminska & Lynn, 2019).

NOTES. Each column reports results from a different regression, where the dependent variable is a Likert scale (0-3) for the correspondent GHQ dimension. The 12 items of the GHQ-12 are: aconcentration, b- loss of sleep, c- playing useful role, d-capable of making decisions, e- constantly under strain, f- problems overcoming difficulties, g- enjoy day-to-day activities, h- ability to
face problems, i- feeling unhappy or depressed, j- losing confidence, k- believe worthless, l- general happiness. Robust standard errors in parentheses *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. Note that

NOTES: Figures report the percentage change in mobility for each dimension with respect to the median value for the corresponding day of the week during the period 3 January 2020 – 6 February
2020. We excluded weekend days and bank holidays to avoid fluctuations. Shaded areas represent the fieldwork days for each UKHLS survey wave. The areas between the colourful vertical lines
represent the reference period for each survey wave regarding the mental health questions. Google mobility data is based on Google Account users who have opted in to Location History. More

Appendix C. Inverse probability weights
In order to construct the weights of our model we first, we first use a response model by estimating
the probability of responding in all waves of the GHQ questionnaire (i.e., taking part of the
balanced sample) as a function of observable variables at the baseline wave (i.e., wave 9). Then
Inverse Probability Weights (IPW) are formed as the inverse of the predicted probability of
responding in the balanced sample. Lastly, we multiply these weights by the cross-sectional weights
from the wave 9 provided by UKHLS. Below, we elaborate the construction of these weights, that
were created following the instructions provided by the UK household Longitudinal Survey
(Kaminska & Lynn, 2019).
Our response model is based on the following probit model:
𝑟𝑖 = 𝑋𝑖 𝛽 + 𝜀𝑖
Individuals included in the response model are all wave 9 respondents who have non-zero weights
in the cross-sectional weights of wave 9, and did not die or move out of the country during our
period of analysis.
𝑟𝑖𝑐 equals 1 if individual 𝑖 responded in al waves to the GHQ questionnaire (i.e., takes part of the
balanced sample), and zero otherwise. 𝑋𝑖 is a vector formed by the following variables measured at
wave 9: age (continuous) , age squared (continuous), female (dummy), education level (categorical:
less than O-level, O-level, higher than A-level, not available), poor self-reported health (dummy),
access to internet (categorical: yes, no, not available), smoker (dummy), labour market status
(employed, unemployed, student, inactive, homemaker, not available), nation (categorical: England,
Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, not available), household quintil (categorical: quintil 1, quintil
2, quintil 3, quintil 4, quintil 5, not available). Results of the response model are reported in Table
B1
IPWs are then formed by the inverse of the predicted probability of being part of the the balanced
sample (𝑟̂𝑖 ).

Lastly, to get our final weights, we multiply the IPWs by the cross-sectional weights of wave 9
provided by UKHLS (Kaminska & Lynn, 2019). Concretely, the cross-sectional weights of wave 9
that best suit for our analysis are named “i_indscui_xw”, and make the sample representative of
individuals who responded the self-completion adult interview at wave 9.

Appendix D. Data on COVID-19 cases and deaths.
The data for COVID-19 cases and deaths used in the robustness checks (Tables A12-A14 of Appendix
A) come from UK government official statistics (https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/download).
The availability of the data slightly varies for the English regions and for Scotland. In Table D1
below, we summarize the availability by region. Based on this, we used the following measures to
control for the impact of the pandemic in the robustness check, always trying to maximize the
comparability of the data from England and Scotland:
- Daily cases by publish date (7-day rolling average)
- Daily cases by specimen date (7-day rolling average)
- Cumulative cases. Based on the specimen date for both English regions and Scotland.
- Daily deaths (7-day rolling average). Based on date of death for English regions, and on publish
date for Scotland.
- Cumulative deaths. Based on date of death for English regions, and on publish date for Scotland.
These variables are measured at regional level, which is the lowest level at which information was
available for both UKHLS and COVID-19 data. There were 10 regions: Scotland and 9 regions of
England (South East, London, North West, East of England, West Midlands, South West, Yorkshire
and the Humber, East Midlands and North East).
Values of these variables are inserted in the model for each individual as of the day before of the
responding date, based on respondent’s region of residence by April 2020 and date of responding.
We therefore assume that the respondent is aware of the epidemic evolution as of the day before of
responding the survey.
For daily cases and daily deaths, we use the 7-day rolling average in order to avoid fluctuations in the
reporting of cases and deaths at the different days of the week when participants responded the survey.
