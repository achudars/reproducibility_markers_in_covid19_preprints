Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruptions to education in the United States, with a
large proportion of schooling moving to online formats, which has the potential to exacerbate existing
racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in learning. We visualize access to online learning
technologies using data from the Household Pulse Survey from the early Fall 2020 schoolyear (August
19-October 26). We find that 10.1% of children participating in online-learning nationally did not have
adequate access to the internet and a computer. Rates of inadequate access varied nearly twentyfold
across the gradient of parental race/ethnicity and education, from 1.9% for children of Asian parents
with a graduate degree, to 35.5% among children of Black parents with less than a high school
education. These findings indicate alarming gaps in potential learning among US children. Renewed
investments in equitable access to distance-learning resources will be necessary to prevent widening
racial/ethnic and class learning disparities.

Article
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruptions to education globally and in the US, with
a large proportion of schooling moving to distance-learning formats that require access to the internet
and computer technology. We use data from the weekly Household Pulse Survey (US Census Bureau
2020), a rapidly deployed, representative sample of the US population, describing early trends in the Fall
2021 school period (August 19–October 26). We estimate that 58.1% (57.5% - 58.7%) of US children
participated in online learning. Of these, 10.1% (95% CI: 9.6% - 10.6%) did not have adequate access to
both the internet and a computer (Figure; see supplement for sample sizes and confidence intervals).
The Gradient by Parental Race/Ethnicity and Education
Lack of adequate access varied nearly twentyfold across the gradient of parental race/ethnicity and
education, ranging from 1.9% (1.2% - 2.7%) for children of Asian parents with a graduate degree, up to
35.5% (24.1% - 47.0%) among children of Black parents with less than high school education (Figure).
These rates varied fourfold by race/ethnicity, ranging from 3.8% (2.8% - 4.9%) for Asian parents up to
15.6% (13.5% - 17.7%) for Black parents and fivefold by parental education, ranging from 3.9% (3.5% 4.3%) for parents with graduate degrees to 20.3% (16.5% - 24.2%) for parents with less than high school
education.
Implications
Even before COVID-19, the United States had profound and persistent disparities in educational
attainment and learning by race and social class (York 2020). The results presented here concur with
recent studies suggesting that that COVID-19 may be further exacerbating existing gaps in schooling
(Bacher-Hicks, Goodman, and Mulhern 2020) and extends them to the Fall 2020 school period. Children
expected to participate in online learning without adequate technology are highly unlikely to achieve
significant learning compared to their peers for whom more resources are available. Falling behind in
learning goals, they may also be more likely to leave school entirely.
By visualizing the gradient by parental race/ethnicity and education, we highlight that COVID-19 is likely
potentiating the intergenerational propagation of gaps in educational outcomes, and moreover in a
differential manner by race/ethnicity. These findings therefore demonstrate that disparities in remote
learning during COVID-19 must be examined in an intersectional fashion (Bhopal and Preston 2012).
Stratification by parental race and education revealed disparities along both dimensions, with specific
subgroups exposed to large magnitude disparities. Further study should examine how racial/ethnic and
social class differences also may vary by geography, potentially reflecting the diversity of educational
approaches taken by municipal and state government in response to COVID-19-related disruptions.
As education is a key social determinant of health, and driver of economic opportunities, the
implications of these widening education gaps are myriad, and may ripple out into disparities in
numerous sectors of society (Lim et al. 2018). These trends highlight a need for renewed investments in
ensuring universal access to distance-learning resources for all children in the United States, and may
have implications for school districts and states making decisions regarding school closures.

Steps Taken to Conduct the Analysis
Public use microdata from the weekly Household Pulse Survey were obtained from the US Census
Bureau: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/datasets.html (accessed
Nov 25, 2020).
1. Data from waves 13-17 were used, as they ask explicitly about the 2020-2021 school year.
2. Parental race and ethnicity were categorized into 5 groups using the RHISPANIC and RRACE
variables. Race and ethnicity variables had no observed missingness.
3. Parental income was excluded as an analytical variable due to high missingness (22%).
4. Parental education was included as an analytical variable given no apparent missingness, and
high relevance to the study topic. It was categorized into 5 categories from the variable EEDUC.
5. A subset of the full dataset was used, consisting of only those households with at least 1 child
currently enrolled in school, who answered affirmatively to the TEACH2 question: “Classes
normally taught in person moved to a distance-learning format using online resources, either
self-paced or in real time.”
6. The outcome variable was defined using the variables COMPAVAIL and INTRNTAVAIL describing
children’s computer and internet access, respectively. Households reporting that both were
“always available” or “usually available” were assigned a value of 0, whereas for households in
which either variable was reported as “sometimes available” “rarely available” and “never
available” a value of 1 was assigned.
7. Missingness in either variable (COMPAVAIL and INTRNTAVAIL) was low, at 0.019% of the subset
of households with children participating in online learning.
8. Percentages were calculated for all values shown in the figure. Survey weights were used for all
values. The weights were calculated by using each household weight, multiplied by the number
of children in the house, to count all children equally.
9. Standard errors for percentages were calculated according the methodology specified by the US
Census Bureau: https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/technicaldocumentation/hhp/Phase2_Source_and_Accuracy_Week_17.pdf (accessed November 25,
2020). This entailed using a weights file produced by the Census Bureau, containing 80
household weights for each respondent. Each outcome for each group was initially calculated
using the main household weight to create the point estimate. Subsequently, each outcome was
calculated 80 times, using each of the 80 household weights. The standard errors for each
estimate was generated using the below formula, where 𝜃̂ is the point estimate and 𝜃𝑖 is the
estimate calculated from each alternative household weight:
80

𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑑 𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟 (𝜃̂) = 𝑠𝑞𝑟𝑡(

4
2
∑(𝜃𝑖 − ̂𝜃 ) )
80
𝑖=1

Methodological Considerations
1. Percentages reflect US households surveyed in the August 19 – October 26 window, from waves
13 through 17 of the survey. Each wave of the survey is equally weighted. The total sample size
for this period was n= 502,692 respondents. The sample size of the subset of households with
children actively participating in online learning was n= 72,179 respondents. See all sample sizes
for each subgroup in the supplemental table below.
2. Standard errors were created by the Census Bureau using successive difference replication. They
primary capture the magnitude of sampling error, although some non-sampling error is
additionally measured. Bias introduced by non-sampling error is not captured.
3. All questions were answered by one representative from each household. In households with
multiple children, there could be nuances between children that are missed by the survey
design. It is likely reasonable to assume that most children in the household have similar access
to the internet and computer technology. It may also be reasonable to assume that onlinelearning decisions affect children in the household equally. However, this does represent a
limitation that should be taken into consideration when interpreting study results.
4. More survey methodological details are available here: https://www.census.gov/programssurveys/household-pulse-survey/technical-documentation.html (accessed November 25, 2020).
5. Additionally, it is important to note that further research will be required to more directly
measure learning gaps stemming from COVID-19 related educational disruptions. While
important, access to the internet and a computer are only a proxy for learning outcomes.
