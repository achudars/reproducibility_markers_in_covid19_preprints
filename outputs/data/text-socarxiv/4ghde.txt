Household air pollution and COVID-19 risk in India

Household air pollution and COVID-19 risk in India: A potential concern
Rachit Sharma1 and Md Mahbub Hossain2

Abstract
One in every two Indian households continues to rely on highly-polluting solid fuels to
meet their cooking and other energy demands. Recent evidence demonstrates that
people suffering from preconditions associated with air pollution and those with shortterm exposures to air pollution are highly susceptible to the novel Coronavirus infection
and associated morbidity and mortality. And as for many Indians, especially those with
pre-existing health conditions and the elderly, home-based isolation and confinement
practices are likely to continue to prevent the infection, exposure to household air

pollution may render such population groups more susceptible to COVID-19. This
warrants caution and demands immediate and specific actions; which are discussed. To
protect the health and wellbeing of millions of Indians, during the COVID-19 crisis and
beyond, addressing household air pollution should be prioritized and aligned with
long term environmental health initiatives in the country.

Household air pollution and COVID-19 risk in India

Introduction
India has been under a nationwide lockdown since March 25, 2020, in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic. While many Indian states and districts plan and execute their
lockdown exit strategies, home-based isolation and confinement practices are much
likelier to continue for those with pre-existing health conditions and the elderly – the
most visible victims of COVID-19. This necessitates the need to acknowledge and
critically evaluate household environmental factors that may render such vulnerable
population groups more susceptible to COVID-19 as they continue to self-isolate at
homes.
The presence of co-morbidities is one of the major risk factors aggravating the impact of
COVID-19. And air pollution, particularly household air pollution (HAP), contributes
substantially to India's disease burden, accounting for a myriad of adverse health
outcomes including respiratory, cardio-metabolic, neuro-behavioral and developmental
disorders, and premature deaths.(1) In 2017, HAP alone accounted for nearly 16 million
disability-adjusted life years and claimed more than half a million lives across the
country.(1) Though in India ambient air pollution levels have drastically plummeted due
to the lockdown, exposure to HAP can be expected to be exponentiated as most citizens
are confined to their homes and will continue to do so during the COVID-19 era.(2) This is
of special concern as about one in every two Indian households continues to rely on
highly-polluting solid fuels (wood, dung, agricultural residues, coal, and charcoal) for
cooking, heating, and other energy services.(1)

Air Pollution and COVID-19 Risk
One of the most common and major health deterrent combustion products of solid-fuels
is fine particulate matter (PM2.5, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less
than 2.5-μm).(1) Recent evidence demonstrates that people suffering from preconditions
associated with PM2.5 exposure are highly prone to the novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
infection and associated morbidity and mortality. A nationwide cross-sectional analysisin
the United States found out that a 1-μg/m3 rise in PM2.5 concentration increases the odds

of COVID-19 mortality by 8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2–15%).(3)

An analysis of 120 Chinese cities established significantly positive associations between
short-term exposure (over prior 2 weeks) to PM2.5 and with newly confirmed COVID-19
cases; with a 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 being associated with a 2.24% (95% CI: 1.02–
3.46%) increase in the daily counts of confirmed cases.(4) In the Netherlands, a similar
analysis of 355 municipalities estimated that a 20 percent rise in PM2.5
concentration led to an increment in the number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases
by nearly 100 percent.(5)

stress, immunosuppression, reduced ability of macrophages to phagocytize viruses,
alteration of the function of surfactant proteins SP-A and SP-D, and increased
permeability of the pulmonary epithelium are some of the potential mechanisms
underlying the association between particulate matter pollution and respiratory viral
infections.(6)
Furthermore, researchers are now exploring the potential role various air pollutants
can themselves have in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2; with preliminary findings
suggesting that SARS-CoV-2, under stable atmospheric conditions and high
concentrations of particulate matter could form clusters with particulate matter and
reduce its diffusion coefficient, enhancing the persistence of the virus in the
atmosphere and augmenting its infectivity.(7)

The Way Forward
For its likelihood to increase the risk of COVID-19 through HAP-mediated health

effects and from the household air pollutants as such, the existing public health
challenge of HAP in India warrants caution and demands immediate and specific
actions.
First, from a research perspective, epidemiological investigations must explore
the associations between HAP exposure and COVID-19 risk in the country. For this,
personal

exposure

measurements,

individual

time-location-activity

patterns,

socio-economic and ethno-cultural differences, and exposure and health implications
of various public health measures undertaken to reduce the transmission of

SARS-CoV-2 should be considered and accounted for. Second, the health authorities
must

communicate

about

the

need

for

maintaining maximum

ventilation

at

homes to minimize health risks from poor household air quality. With the latest
evidence suggesting that the genetic material (RNA) of SARS-CoV-2 can persist for
hours in the air in crowded or poorly ventilated spaces, aiding its transmission, the
benefits of ensuring optimal ventilation could be even more far-reaching

health.(8)

Third,

public

and institutional

partners should ensure robust door-step delivery mechanisms for clean cooking

interventions, especially for households not included under the umbrella of Pradhan
Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY). The PMUY aims to provide a subsidy and loan to
eligible 100 million below-poverty-line Indian households to cover the upfront cost of
acquiring an LPG connection. And under the Indian government’s

COVID-19

economic relief package for the poor, the scheme of three LPG refills at no cost for a
period of three months (April to June 2020) has been extended to the existing PMUY
customer base of about 83 million households.(9) However, this leaves out the
remainder of the 17 million eligible households, which should be targeted. Last,

post–COVID-19, the government must bolster its endeavors for deeper diffusion
and sustained use of clean cooking fuels and systems under PMUY. While a
considerable number

of

households

implemented in 2016, issues such as recurring gas refill expenses, free access to
solid cooking fuels, household financial instability, and poor LPG availability and
accessibility in rural areas continue to hinder the adoption of LPG as the primary
household fuel.(10) Such issues must be acknowledged and addressed in the long-run.

Conclusion
Household air pollution, though a long-standing population health challenge in
India, presents itself as a renewed health crisis in the country for its probability of
increasing the risk of development of COVID-19 and associated health disparities
among vulnerable population groups. Therefore, to protect the health and wellbeing of
millions of Indians, during the COVID-19 crisis and beyond, addressing household air
pollution should be prioritized and aligned with long term environmental health
initiatives in the country.
