ABSTRACT
The purpose of the study is to examine the status of scholarly literature on Corona virus indexed in the big database,
the Lens, taking into account, top-cited articles, top contributors, top active country region, most accepted study
field and open access status. Relative growth rate (RGR) and Doubling time (Dt) calculation is also a major reflects
of the paper. The study analyzes the status of scholarly publications on Corona virus research as indexed by Lens
spanning a period from the oldest record until July 15, 2020. “Structured Search” was made under “New Scholar
Search” using the term “Corona virus” and restrict the search result only for “Journal Article”. Results obtained
were imported through email (.csv file) for further analysis and visualization using spreadsheet software. The
results of the study show that out of total 26628 scholarly outputs 2109 are cited in a patent while 15963 in another
scholarly literature. “The University of Hong Kong” is the most productive university with 412 scholarly literature,
“The United States” as a most contributing country provides 8433 publications, “Journal of Virology” is the most
contributing journal with 1012 publications, “Kwok-Yung Yuen” contributed maximum as an individual author and
“Elsevier” as a top journal publisher. Among the Lens indexed scholarly publications on Corona virus, 64.04%
obtained open accessibility in terms of open access colour while 64.09% under an open-access. No previous study
could be identified dealing with such meta-analysis using the Lens database.

INTRODUCTION
Scholarly literature is intended for use in support of conducting in-depth research, often containing specialized
vocabulary and extensive references to sources. The rate of the research output of a country depends upon the
present economics, academic structure, research facilities, health issues and involvement of government ministry.
The outbreak of present pandemic Corona virus [first called 2019-nCoV and officially renamed as SARS-CoV2 (the
virus) and COVID-19 (the disease)] (Sarukhan, 2020) is become a global threat and has a clear negative impact on

humanity, including human life and knowledge creation, as a standard of human development. People keep
themselves at home to maintain social distancing for reducing the outbreak of community transmission. This
COVID-19 epidemic is neither the first and confidently nor the last epidemic that will pose a threat to human life.
This Corona virus belongs to a family of viruses that attack the respiratory system. And it is also interesting to note
that the Corona virus appears to be a new virus, but it is a prevailing strain of the virus which exists in the earth from
many more years in many other forms. Most Corona viruses infect only animals but seven, including SARS and
MERS, are known to infect humans and the 2019 Novel Corona virus or 2019-nCoV is one of the deadlier ones. As
of it is not a totally new class of virus, the research on Corona virus also started from many more years ago and
scholarly literature also published in health science for the same. First Literature Published on Corona virus entitled
“Antigenic Relationships Among the Corona viruses of Man and Between Human and Animal Corona viruses”
published in the year 1969 in the “Journal of Immunology”. This paper examined the status of scholarly literature on
Corona virus indexed in the big database, the Lens, taking into account, top-cited articles, top contributors, top
active country region, most accepted study field and open access status. Another major focus of the present study is
to calculate relative growth rate (RGR) and doubling time (Dt) of global research output on Corona virus.

COVID-19 AND GLOBAL IMPACT
Pandemics are mostly outbreaks of disease which become widespread as a result of the spread of human-to-human
infection. In history, among the major outbreaks of disease and pandemics, Spanish Flu, Hong Kong Flu, SARS,
H7N9, Ebola, Zika are significant ones (WHO, 2020b) (Rewar, Mirdha, & Rewar, 2015) (Maurice, Zhu, Kim, &
Abouassaly, 2016). The recent pandemic, Corona virus belongs to a family of viruses that attack the respiratory
system. Corona in Latin means ‘crown’, and ancient Greek ‘Korone’ means ‘garland’. The name refers to the pointy
fringe circling these viruses (Belluz, 2020). The COVID-19 virus has various ways of affecting different individuals.
COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and most infected patients may experience mild to moderate symptoms and
recover without any special treatment. According to the report, people with chronic medical problems and those
above the age of 60 have a higher risk of developing serious illness and death. Popular COVID-19 symptoms
include fever, fatigue, and dry cough. For others, shortness of breath, aches & pains and sore throat is important,
although very few people experience diarrhoea, diarrhoea or a runny nose.

Situation Reports, official publications of the World Health Organization (WHO) provide the latest updates on the
novel Corona virus outbreak. This includes an updated number of infected people, total cases, active cases, total
recovered, total death etc. As per the latest situation report (Situation Report-177, July 15, 2020), globally
approximately 10357662 (163939 new) confirmed cases with 508055 (4188 new) death due to Corona virus. This
deadly virus originates from China in December 2019 and reached at the stage of community transmission within
one and half months. The situations of the world’s top countries affected by Corona virus are listed below,

REVIEW OF LITERATURE
Nasab & Rahim (2020) in their study conducted a qualitative and quantitative analysis of Global Scientific Research
on SARS-CoV-2 publication outputs, journals, taking into account, authors, institutions, countries, cited references,
keywords, and terms according to bibliometric methods using the help of the VOS viewer c software packages. To
detect the recent research publications the was data collected in-between the period 2019-2020 from Web of Science
(WOS), PubMed, and Scopus Core Collection on March 02, 2020. Similarly, Chahrour et al. (2020) explored the
PubMed database and the World Health Organization (WHO) database; Radha (2020) examined Web of Science
(WOS) database and Dehghanbanadaki et al. (2020) extracted from Scopus database for relevant observational and
interventional publications pertaining to COVID-19 since December 2019. Again in another study Ram (2020) try to
explore 50 years of bibliographic assessment using Scopus database where annual growth, productive countries,
institutes, authors, journals, highly cited papers, and keywords using in Corona virus research article are of primary
focus. Mao, Guo, Fu, & Xiang (2020) studied research publications related to Corona virus from January 2003 to
February 2020 and retrieved from the Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-E) of the Web of Science database,
while Sivankalai & Badhusha (2020) were doing a thorough bibliometric study using Web of Science core
collection in between the time period 2005-2019. The results of the recent studies that means in which the time
coverage is from or near about December 2019, when the outbreak of the pandemic recently originated at Wuhan,
China indicated that China accounted for the highest number of publications followed by the USA & Canada; The
Lancet & BMJ Clinical Research Ed were the most published journals and University of Hong Kong and Huazhong
University of Science & Technology were the most productive institution. But in the case of metrics study based on
decadal or 50 years growth trend, the USA obtained the most of the research publications, The Journal of Virology
published most number of publications and the University of Hong Kong was the most productive institute. The
variation of the result may come from the point of time range selected for those study.

OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
(i) The main objectives of this study is to focus on the present status of global publication output in Corona virus
research and its citation impact.
(ii) To identify top ten scholarly publications on Corona virus research attaining highest scholarly & patent citations.
(iii) To examine the contribution of top 10 most productive institutions, countries, publishers and authors;
(iv) To analyse the global publication output of Corona virus research among top 10 subject field;
(v) Examine the OA status of scholarly publications on Corona virus research in terms of degree of access/usage
freedom expressed universally by OA Colour and CC Licenses.
(vi) Evaluate the RGR and Doubling time of scholarly publications on Corona virus ranging from 16 July 1969 to 15
July 2020.

SCOPE OF THE STUDY
The study analyze the status of scholarly publications on Corona virus (n-CoV/COVID-19) research as indexed by
Lens spanning a period from the oldest record until July 1, 2020. The literature on a different dimension of COVID19 including types of scholarly publications based on scholarly citation & patent citation count, leading institutions
& countries engaged in R&D, fields of study, leading authors and publishers, open access status etc., have been
analyzed to reveal significant findings. The types of research publications restricted to only journal article for this

898

Table 4 above reveals the overall status of the top 10 publications on Corona virus research in terms of patent
citation count. It is considered as a recognition if a research paper cited in a patent. The paper entitled “Mapping of
linear antigenic sites on the S glycoprotein of a neurotropic murine Corona virus with synthetic peptides” authored
by Claude Daniel; Martial Lacroix; and Pierre J. Talbot published in 1994 received the highest patent citations i.e.,
172. The total number of patent citations gained by these highly influential papers were 898 which is almost 11% of
the total patent citations gained. The year of publication (YoP) of the articles ranges from 1990 to 2004. It is also
interesting to note that 70% of these top 10 papers are available as open access (OA).

2. Institution Wise Distribution:
Whatever methods used, the status of research publications is an essential factor in the overall ranking of an
institution. Among the top 10 institutions of scholarly publications on Corona virus (Table 5), “University of Hong
Kong” contributed the maximum number of publications (i.e. 412, 14.28%) followed by “Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention” & “Chinese Academy of Sciences” with 364 (i.e. 12.61%) and 353 (i.e. 12.23%)
publications respectively. Again the scholarly research on Corona virus obtained 10.84% of its overall publications
from these top 10 institutions.

As the study field are correlated with each other, normal distribution and differentiation can’t be possible in that
case. Thus except of collecting individual data in tabular form it is better to display it in a comparative bar-chart.
Figure 1 depicts the most accepted field of study related to Corona virus research. As expected in medical science
subject field specified with “Corona virus” & “Virology” occupied maximum area of research followed by
“Medicine” and “Biology” with 15% & 14% coverage respectively.

8. OA Status of Research Publications on Corona virus:
There are many types of open access, perhaps because it is such a young movement that it's still developing
standards. According to SHERPA/RoMEO journal publishers are classified into four basic types and which indicates
by four different colours, viz. Green, Blue, Yellow and White. Again OA policy also uses some license (Creative
Common License) for valid distribution of publications under OA but with some terms and conditions. In the
present study, the Lens database categorized the OA status of the scholarly LIS publications into two different way,
viz. according to OA Colour and according to OA License.

Table 10 displayed the distribution of scholarly LIS publications according to OA Colour. It has four basic types
with colour code Green, Gold, Bronze & Hybrid. There are also some OA publications owning no OA colour. In the
case of OA publications by colour, Bronze OA covers the highest number of OA publications i.e. 7559 (44.33%),
followed by Gold and no OA colour with 4961 (20.09%) & 1766 (10.36%) publications respectively. Again, 1731
publications cover under Green OA policy and 1035 number of OA publications under hybrid OA colour. The total
number of publications covers under OA colour obtain 64.04% of total scholarly publications on Corona virus.
However, Lens does not categorizes research publications into other prevalent OA colours such as Blue, Yellow,
White, Diamond and Platinum.

Table 11 above indicates the result of the OA status of the present study according to several OA licenses. It is
evident from the table that OA publications on Corona virus without any known license covers the highest
percentage (62.84%) and OA publications with CC BY (19.85%) and CC BY-NC-ND (7.97%) are in second and
third position respectively. The total number of publications covers under OA license obtain 64.09% of total
scholarly publications on Corona virus which is slightly higher than covered by OA colour.

RELATIVE GROWTH RATE (RGR) & DOUBLING TIME (Dt):
The study also examines the research trends on Corona virus over fifty years (i.e. starting from 1969). The growth of
publications was analysed by using two parameters Relative Growth Rate and Doubling time (Mahapatra, 1985).
The Relative Growth Rate displays the increase in the number of publications on Corona virus research output
during different periods. RGR is a measure to study the increase in the number of publications of time. It is
calculated as,

Where,
P2 and P1 are the cumulative number of publications in the year’s T2 and T1;
P1= LogP1 (Natural log of initial number of publication);
P2=LogP2 (Natural log of final number of publication).

Doubling time is the time required for publications to become double of the existing amount. It is directly related to
RGR and is defined as the time required for the articles to become two-fold of the existing amount. If the number of
articles in subject doubles during a given period, then difference between logarithms of numbers at the end of this
period must be the logarithm of the number 2. In this study Napier logarithm is used, and the taken value of loge2 is
0.693. Hence, as per this (0.693), an average growth rate we calculated by what time interval the Napier logarithm
of numbers does increase by 0.693 (Basavraja, Vinay & Kori, 2019). So the Doubling time is calculated using the
following formula:

Where,
Dt= Doubling time
RGR= Relative Growth Rate

Table 12. Relative Growth Rate (RGR) and Doubling Rate (Dt) of Scholarly Publications on Corona virus

The table 12 outlines the status of RGR and the doubling time of the scholarly LIS research ranging from 16 July,
1969 to 15 July, 2020. The result of the study indicates that the decadal RGR and doubling time of scholarly
literature on Corona virus is not constant, rather it shows an up & down in growth curve (figure 2). As expected the
research on Corona virus increased with a certain rate in each time-span started from July 1969 - July 1979 to July
2009 -July 2019 but in last one year i.e. July 2019 - July 2020 it shows an immense rise.

A Meta-Analysis of Scholarly Research on Corona virus through Big Data Approach

It is evident from the figure 3 that the time span between July 2019- July 2020 obtained maximum relative growth
rate (RGR) value (i.e. 3.39) while July 2009-2019 has the lowest RGR value (= 1.05). The average value of the
RGR is 1.75 also indicated as Mean RGR.

Figure 3. Relative Growth Rate (RGR) of Scholarly Research on Corona virus

As RGR is reversely proportional to Doubling Time (Dt), July 2019- July 2020 time span associated with lowest
value of Dt (= 0.204) and July 2009- July 2020 is in top position with Dt= 0.660.

Figure 4. Doubling rate of Scholarly Research on Corona virus

The figures above displays that though the growth rate of average publication follow a fixed increasing trend (figure
2) but the Relative Growth Rate (RGR) & Doubling Time (Dt) (i.e. figure 3 & 4) don’t follow any fixed pattern.

CONCLUSION
The first literature published on Corona virus was “Antigenic Relationships Among the Corona viruses of Man and
Between Human and Animal Corona viruses” published in the year 1969 in the “Journal of Immunology”.
Therefore, it is evident that neither the Corona virus disease nor the research output in this area is new and the
present study analyzed a qualitative and quantitative description of more than 50 years of world research output on
Corona virus. As the study conducted through “The Lens”, it also promotes the use of Lens as a big data academic
search engine. A total of 26,628 scholarly outputs are indexed in the Lens related to Corona virus research and out
of which 2109 are cited in a patent with 8174 patent citations while 15963 works are cited in another scholarly
literature with 529494 scholarly citations. “The University of Hong Kong” is the most productive university with
412 scholarly literature, “The United States” as a most contributing country provides 8433 publications, “Journal of
Virology” is the most contributing journal with 1012 publications, “Kwok-Yung Yuen” contributed maximum (i.e.
209 publications) as an individual author and “Elsevier” as a top published (i.e. 1453 publications) journal publisher.
As the medical community needs the latest research update, open accessibility is the only way that scientific
research can be spread uniformly around the globe. Among the scholarly research publications on Corona virus
indexed in the Lens, 64.04% obtained open accessibility in terms of open access colour and among which “Bronze”
open access occupied 44.33 % of publications. Again, 64.09% of total scholarly output also ensures open
accessibility under an open-access license and among which 62.84% don’t possess any open access licensing
information. The mean RGR and mean Dt of the study calculated as 1.75 & 0.473 respectively (in between the time
span July 1969-July 2020). The present study can be concluded with the fact that the Lens database is a combination
of PubMed, Crossref, Microsoft Academic, CORE, PubMed Central, ORCID, & Impact story. It includes almost the
entire field of the scholarly research output and gives a clear picture to a user about their relative field of interest.
Hence, the Lens knows backwards and forwards of any field and prove itself as an available, adequate, accessible,
affordable & appropriate (5 A’s of Access) (Patient Access Partnership, n.d.) database by giving its users an
authoritative source for their research.
