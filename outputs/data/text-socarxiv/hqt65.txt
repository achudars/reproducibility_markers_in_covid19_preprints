Intro d u c t i o n
A rumo r

can be unde r s t o o d

as a curr e n tly circul a ti n g

repo r t

of an

unce r t a i n trut h. Rumo r s spre a d thro u g h social medi a usu ally take the
form of fake news, misinfor m a t i o n or disinfor m a t io n.

Fake news can be

define d as unt r u e inform a tio n that is pres e n t e d as news, misinfor m a t i o n
can be define d as false inform a t io n which is circula t e d reg a r dl e s s of the
inte n tion

to

deceive

while

disinfor m a t i o n

can

be

define d

as

false

infor m a ti o n spre a d with the inten tion to inten tio n ally deceive [1] .
The

COVID- 19

pan d e m i c

has

bee n

associ a t e d

with

the

spre a d

of

misinfor m a t i o n and rumo r s via social media since its arrival in India [2].
Of the various social media apps, What sApp is a popula r mes s a gi n g app
in India and has bee n implicat e d in the spre a d of rumo r s in the past [3].
Given the ubiquity and eas e of use of this app, it has bee n a vehicle to
spre a d

COVID- 19 relat e d rumo r s and fake news and this has led to

adve r s e psychologic al cons e q u e n c e s in cons u m e r s . The spre a d of this
cont e n t is mainly by forwa r di n g a mess a g e (text, audio or video) into a
grou p or to an individu al (also using What sApp) in the conta c t s list of the
send e r . Lately the issue of WhatsAp p forw a r d s being use d to spre a d
rumo r s abou t COVID- 19 has gaine d impor t a n c e in Punjab with the stat e
adminis t r a t io n having arr e s t e d some individu als for spre a di n g rumo r s on
social media [4]. Thes e rumo r s have caus e d difficultie s in carryin g out
testin g and identifica tio n of patie n t s [4].

Thus, it is import a n t to be

since the 1st of Sept e m b e r 2020. These forwa r d s were analys e d and the
res ult s are pres e n t e d .
Res u l t s
The aut ho r s acce s s e d 6 mess a g e s . Of thes e, 3 were in the form of text
mess a g e s (2 in Hindi and 1 in Punjabi), ther e were 2 videos and an audio
mess a g e . The cont e n t of the text mess a g e s was rea d by the autho r s . A
conde n s e d version of the mes s a g e s is pres e n t e d below.
1.1 Me s s a g e 1. (In Gur m u k h i scrip t )
Mobile testin g service for COVID- 19 has sta rt e d , but the village head m a n
should ask the following ques tio n s.
1.1.1

When ther e is no vaccine, why look for patie n t s ?

1.1.2

Why do people with COVID- 19 die in hospit als and not in

their hom e s ?
1.1.3

When

ther e

is no tre a t m e n t ,

hospit al? Only to die?
1.1.4

Who will pay the bill?

why are

patie n t s

take n

to

1.1.5

How is it that out of 33 lakh patie n t s with COVID- 19 in India,

25 lakh have improve d withou t a vaccine ?
1.1.6

You can test but we will not allow anyon e to be take n away

from the village.
Note: if anyon e has sympto m s of cough, sore thro a t , fever, difficulty in
bre a t hi n g, they should try hom e rem e di e s and consult a family doctor. If
you go to a hospit al, you will be sent back packe d. The choice is yours.
1.2 Me s s a g e 2. (In Hin d i scri p t )
I have a testin g lab, and I got 10 sam pl e s for testing today. All test e d
neg a tive but if I repor t the trut h, I will not ear n anythi n g. So, I repor t e d 4
as positive and they got their family mem b e r s also and I rep e a t e d the
sam e proc e d u r e . This way I have many patie n t s . Can anyon e stop me
from beco mi n g a millionai r e ?
Think abou t thes e funny storie s.
1.2.1

People have trea t e d people for an illness with no cure and

mint e d millions. Some have used the fear of Coron a vir u s to make
millions.
1.2.2

After enou g h has bee n earn e d from the sale of N95 masks,

they will be declar e d ineffective. Sam e will be the case with hand
sanitize r s , han d was h and immu n o m o d u l a t o r s . Then will come the
stag e of making money thro u g h vaccine s. If the fear will rem ai n,
the mark e t will rem ai n.

WHO (World Horro r Orga niz a tio n) is always with you.

1.3 Me s s a g e 3. (In Hin d i Scri p t )
The WHO has prohibit e d the autop sy of peopl e who have died from
COVID- 19. Howev e r, docto r s in Italy have autop si e d people who have
died of COVID- 19 to find out the trut h and found that this is a fraud.
There is no virus, deat h s are caus e d by a bact e ri a due to ‘Amplified
global 5G elect r o m a g n e t i c radia tio n’ which is poisono u s . This bact e ri a
caus e s ‘clotting’ of blood in the vessels and leads to deat h. Italian doctor s
reco m m e n d

use of antibiotics, anti- inflam m a t o r y

table t s

and aspirin.

There is no nee d for admis sio n and ICU care. China has know n this all
along and kept it to itself. Italian doctor s did not agre e

with WHO

protocols and by the use of para c e t a m o l and aspirin, saved 1400 0 lives in
a single day. Sourc e: Italian Minist ry of Healt h.

The grou p of relative s ask the docto r s to switc h on the ventilat o r again.
As the ventilato r is switch e d on, the chest of the patie n t start s moving
and some gra p h s star t appe a ri n g on the ventila to r scre e n . The relatives
start abusin g that the patien t is alive, and the hospit al people have
purpo s ely switch e d off the ventila to r to kill the patie n t and to get a new
patien t for ear nin g more money.

Dis c u s s i o n
Rumor s see m to be invaria bly associa t e d with epide mi c s [5]. Howev e r ,
unlike before when rumo r s were spre a d by word of mout h, social media
ena bl e s rumo r s to be spre a d

efficiently and withou t loss of cont e n t .

WhatsAp p (and othe r mes s a gi n g apps) are qualit atively differ e n t from
othe r

7

social media apps (such as twitte r) in that the origin a tio n

of

forw a r d e d

mess a g e s

often

canno t

be trac e d

back,

one

can

post

a

mess a g e to a grou p and that mess a g e can be rea d by people who are not
nece s s a rily your cont a c t s and mess a g e s are encryp t e d within pee r- topee r tra n s m i s sio n s. Thus What sAp p is an efficien t mea n s of spre a di n g
rumo r s [6].
An analysis of the mes s a g e s

sugg e s t s

that ther e is a chan g e

in the

cont e n t of the myths that wer e circul ati n g online in the initial part of the
pand e mi c [7]. The main the m e s that wer e identified are as follows.
1.7.1

COVID- 19

is

a

bogey

that

is

raise d

for

unscr u p ul o u s

gover n m e n t s , doctor s , indus t ri alis t s, labs etc. to make money off
com m o n people by various mea n s .
1.7.2

Orga n harve s ti n g is being condu c t e d by unsc r u p u l o u s docto r s

and hospit als by admitti n g patie n t s in the nam e of COVID- 19 and
causin g their dea t h. This notion is reinforc e d by the fact that as per
gover n m e n t

reg ul a tio n s , bodie s of patie n t s who have died with

COVID- 19 are packe d in the hospit al, the whole body is not visible
to the relatives and is cre m a t e d by the local autho ritie s withou t the
relatives gettin g a cha nc e to touch or othe r w is e inspe c t it othe r
than confirmin g the identification.
1.7.3

The 5G conspir a c y theory and COVID- 19 is well known in the

west e r n count ri e s , but we were able to acce s s a version of the
sam e which had bee n modified to make it easily unde r s t a n d a b l e to
Indian audie n c e s . How ev e r, the the m e is as desc ri b e d above.

Secon dly

thes e

mes s a g e s

have

bee n

const r u c t e d

for

ease

of

und e r s t a n d i n g in the vern a c ul a r lang u a g e , brief and free of jargo n unless
it is for giving an impr e s sio n of scientific validity (Italia n minist ry of
healt h etc.) and also atte m p t s to valida t e it by providing a sourc e .
Thes e the m e s must be seen in a wide r cont ext whe r e the prolifer a tio n of
che a p inter n e t and ubiquity of sma r t p h o n e s has enabl e d a cultu r e of
forw a r d e d mess a g e s of various types. The acce p t a bility and eas e of thes e
mess a g e s has led to the profusion of alter n a t iv e news for the past few
years, this has bee n use d to bypas s tradition al media by political partie s
and othe r group s . Ther e is also an incre a si n g tend e n c y for What sApp
spre a d rumo r s to be cont ri b u t o ry to mob lynchin g s which have been
filmed and sha r e d online with little lawful retri b u tio n [8]. In othe r words,
online rum o r s and fake conte n t has not bee n count e r e d effectively for a
long time and has henc e gaine d validity as trut h or is at least ade q u a t e to
cre a t e a doubt in the minds of many cons u m e r s [9]. Ther e is also a
tend e n c y to forw a r d mes s a g e s withou t evalu a ti n g it critically [9]. The
curr e n c y that such rumo r s gain may also be indicative of the lack of trust
betw e e n
during

Finally, ther e are repo r t s of short a g e s of medicin e and oxygen in various
part s of the count ry.
The curr e n t surg e in rumo r s coincide s with a surg e in the num b e r of
COVID patie n t s in the last 4- 6 weeks in India (the milesto n e of 33 lakh
patien t s in India mentio n e d in mes s a g e 1 was achieve d in the 2nd week
of Augus t 2020). This is acco m p a n i e d by a surg e in the num b e r of deat h s
while the situa tio n see m s to be gettin g bett e r in many count ri e s barrin g
a few excep tion s.

Mand a t o r y

isolation

at home

or hospit al requir e s

withd r a w a l from jobs and occup a tio n which is inconve ni e n t , stigm a tizin g
and leads to financial stres s in a majority of people [10]. Thus, many
asym p t o m a t i c or mildly sympto m a t i c patie n t s would prefe r not to get
test e d and have to get isolat e d as per the provisions of the law. Orga n
harve s ti n g rumo r s see m to be cross- cultur ally preval e n t

[11].
