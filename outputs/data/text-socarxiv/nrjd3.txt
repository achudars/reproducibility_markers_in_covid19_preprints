Summary
•

The activities performed by workers in some occupations may increase the risk of
exposure to COVID-19. This paper explores how occupational exposure risks vary by
labour force characteristics in the Canadian context, using Census and O*Net data.

•

The O*Net data provides information on the level of physical proximity and frequency of
exposure to infections or diseases faced by workers in different occupations. Note that
occupational risks of exposure do not directly translate into probabilities of infection
because it does not rely on epidemiological data on infection rates by occupation.

•

Women work in occupations associated with significantly higher risks of exposure to
COVID-19 than men, a gap driven by women’s over-representation in the three broad
occupational groupings with the highest risk levels.

•

Health occupations are associated with very high values for risks of exposure to COVID19. Sales and services occupations and occupations in education, law and social,
community and government services also demonstrate higher risk of exposure than other
occupational categories.

•

Workers age 65 or older, a group at higher risk of contracting COVID-19, work in
occupations for which the degree of physical proximity is significantly lower on average
than younger workers. However, differences in the frequency of exposure of older
workers to infections or diseases is minimal.

•

There are no significant differences in the occupational risk of exposure to COVID-19
faced by Canadian-born and immigrant workers and by Canadians who are members of a
visible minority group and those who are not. First Nations people, Métis and Inuit
appear to face greater occupational risks in comparison with non-Indigenous Canadians.

•

Workers in low-income occupations are employed in occupations that put them at greater
risk of exposure to COVID-19 than workers not in low-income occupations. This is
consequential because they are likely to face strong financial disincentives to be absent
from work if they contract the virus, which may increase the risk of transmission at work.
Women, immigrants and members of visible minority groups in low-wage occupations
are more likely to experience a situation of higher occupational risk of exposure.

•

The findings presented in this research note are also applicable to the understanding of
occupational risks of exposure to other infectious diseases with transmission mechanisms
similar to COVID-19. On a more general level, the objective of this study is to contribute
to an understanding of the health repercussions of the occupation-level bundling of job
tasks in order to shed light on that understudied dimension of stratification and inequality

Sociodemographic Determinants of Occupational Risks of Exposure to COVID-19 in
Canada
Xavier St-Denis1, University of Toronto
Abstract
The activities performed by Canadian workers in some occupations may increase the risk of exposure to infectious
diseases such as COVID-19. This research note explores how occupational exposure risks vary by labour force
characteristics using publicly available Canadian data in combination with a dataset providing information on the level
of physical proximity and frequency of exposure to infections or diseases faced by workers in different occupations.
I find important sociodemographic differences. First, women work in occupations associated with significantly higher
average risks of exposure to COVID-19 than men. This is driven by their over-representation in high-risk broad
occupational categories such as health occupations. Second, older workers (65 years old or more), a group vulnerable
to COVID-19, appear to work in occupations requiring performing activities that require a lower level of physical
proximity than their younger colleagues, with minimal differences in the frequency of exposure to diseases or
infections. Finally, workers in low-income occupations are employed in occupations that put them at greater risk of
exposure to COVID-19 than other workers. This is especially the case for women, immigrants and members of visible
minority groups in low-income occupations. More broadly, this research note provides insights into the health-related
dimension of the literature on occupational tasks and labour market stratification.

Résumé
Les tâches effectuées par les travailleurs canadiens dans certaines professions peuvent augmenter le risque
d’exposition à des maladies infectieuses tel que la COVID-19. Cette note de recherche explore la variation dans les
risques d’exposition à la COVID-19 selon les caractéristiques des travailleurs en se basant sur des données publiques
canadiennes combinées à une base de données fournissant de l’information sur le niveau de proximité physique et la
fréquence d’exposition à des infections ou maladie auxquels font face les personnes occupant différentes professions.
Nous trouvons d’importantes différences entre catégories sociodémographiques. Premièrement, les femmes travaillent
dans des professions associées à des niveaux moyens de risques d’exposition à la COVID-19 significativement plus
élevés que les hommes, qui s’explique en partie par leur surreprésentation dans des grandes catégories professionnelles
à haut niveau de risque tel que les professions du secteur de la santé. Deuxièmement, les travailleurs âgés (65 ans et
plus), un groupe vulnérable à la COVID-19, semblent travailler dans des professions demandant d’effectuer des tâches
menant à un niveau plus faible de proximité physique que leurs plus jeunes collègues, alors que les différences
d’exposition à des maladies ou infections sont limitées. Finalement, les personnes travaillant dans des professions à
faible revenu tendent également à travailler dans des professions plus à risque d’exposition à la COVID-19 que les
autres travailleurs, ce qui est particulièrement le cas pour les femmes, les immigrants et les personnes membres
minorités visibles travaillant dans des professions à faible revenu. De manière plus générale, cette note de recherche
explore les implications en matière de santé de la littérature sur les tâches professionnelles et la stratification du marché
du travail.

INTRODUCTION
A number of inequalities have become visible among workers since the beginning of the COVID19 pandemic. Most notably, public-facing sectors such as accommodation, food services, retail
trade, tourism and recreation have been highly impacted, translating into important industry
differences in job losses in the period immediately following the start of the outbreak (Statistics
Canada 2020a). In addition, low-wage workers are more likely to experience financial difficulties
as a result of job losses or absence from work.
Relatedly, recent analyses have highlighted how some occupations require completing activities
that increase the risk of infection with COVID-19. These include the level of physical proximity
to other individuals and the frequency of exposure to diseases or infections (of all kinds).
Occupations in food processing and healthcare are examples of such jobs, as highlighted by data
on COVID-19 clusters from news reports (The New York Times 2020). The objective of this
empirical research note is to explore the distribution of occupational exposure risks in the Canadian
workforce and to identify the sociodemographic characteristics associated with high or low
occupational exposure risk scores (note that the concept of risk of exposure does not allow to
directly estimate the risk of infection the same way epidemiological data does).
The results presented below find an unequal distribution of occupational characteristics associated
with a higher risk of exposure to COVID-19 (level of physical proximity with other individuals,
and frequency of exposure to diseases or infections) across different groups of the workforce. First,
women appear to face high occupational risks of exposure to COVID-19 than men. This is driven
to a large extent by the fact that women are over-represented in broad occupational categories that
have substantially higher average risk scores, such as health occupations. Second, I also find
important differences by Aboriginal identity. In contrast, there are only limited differences by
immigration status and visible minority status. Third, outside of health occupations, workers with
a Bachelor’s degree or more tend to face significantly lower occupational risks of exposure.
Importantly, older workers (55 to 64 years old and 65 years old or more), a group at high risk of
infection, hospitalisation and complications, including death (Public Health Agency of Canada
2020), do not appear to work in occupations that have a higher physical proximity score than
younger workers. Those between 15 and 24 years old score the highest. Disaggregated results how
that this pattern is found across occupations except in the two highest-scoring broad occupational
categories, where there is no significant age difference. Meanwhile, the mean score for frequency
of exposure to diseases or infections is lower for 15-24 years old workers compared to all other
groups, but the median is the highest. Workers age 65 years old or more have a lower mean but
higher median score than those between 25 and 64 years old. Among workers in health occupations
more specifically, an occupational category with extreme values for the exposure to diseases or
infections score, 55 to 64 and 65+ years old workers are at higher risk of exposure than their
younger colleagues by several points. However, age differences in mean frequency of exposure to
infections or diseases are not statistically significant in regression analyses.
Finally, I find that workers in low-income occupations are more likely to be employed in
occupations in the top half of both of the exposure risk score distributions when compared with
those not working in a low-income occupation. This pattern is especially visible among women,

4

immigrant and visible minority workers. This is consequential to the extent that low-income
workers may face financial disincentives for absence even if they are sick or vulnerable, increasing
the risk of workplace transmission. This finding is especially significant if no measures are taken
to close establishments and to provide income support to employees who are absent from work.
This paper provides evidence on which groups of the labour force are at greater risk of exposure
to COVID-19 based on the characteristics of their occupation. In addition to providing evidence
of important sociodemographic differences in exposure risks, it shows that gender and education
sorting into different occupations is an important driver of disparities in health-related outcomes
at work. In other words, the findings suggest that there are repercussions to gender- and educationbased occupational sorting into jobs that bundle tasks differently beyond income and
socioeconomic outcomes. A health-related dimension of “life chances” or “life conditions” is not
frequently investigated in the sociological literature on occupations and stratification (Weeden and
Grusky 2005; Wodtke 2017), and is gaining visibility as the risk of workplace transmission of
COVID-19 is discussed by the public and in public health policy-making circles.
While the results presented in this paper contribute to our understanding of exposure risks at work
in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it can also be used more broadly to highlight certain
sociodemographic determinants of the occupational risks of exposure to other types of infections
or diseases at work. The paper relies solely on publicly available data sources in order to ensure a
quick turnover. At the time of writing, access to scientific-use Canadian microdata was not
possible. Further analyses building on this paper can contribute to a better understanding of which
worker characteristics are associated with a high degree of occupational risk of exposure or of
actual infection to COVID-19 or other infectious disease in order to guide public health decisions
at the intersection of occupational safety and health.
REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
Occupations play an important role in social stratification. Differences in earnings across detailed
occupational categories explain a large proportion of the variance in earnings (Mouw and
Kalleberg 2010; Weeden, Kim, Di Carlo, and Grusky 2007; Williams 2013), and a number of
studies find that occupation-level task content and skill intensity account for a substantial portion
of the relationship between education and income (Carbonaro 2007; Liu and Grusky 2013; SimardDuplain and St-Denis 2020). Important theoretical statements and empirical studies in sociology
emphasize the importance of stratification and class structuration at the level of detailed
occupations (Weeden and Grusky 2012). However, in many other cases measuring job task and
skill content at the occupational level is a matter of convenience and data availability. This is
especially true given the existence of the O*Net dataset and its predecessor, the U.S. Dictionary
of Occupational Titles, which provides a comprehensive profile of the work activities and features
of the work context of detailed U.S. occupations.
More specifically, the O*Net database is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor since
1998, and disseminated online. It collects standardized information on the activities and tasks
workers in 974 occupations2 are required to perform as part of their jobs (as well as the knowledge,
skills, and abilities requirements), typically using ordinal scales. This information is gathered
2

These occupations correspond to those of the U.S. 2010 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system.

5

regularly through surveys of U.S. workers in each occupation and occupational experts. This yields
occupation-level scores that can be matched to observations from other data sources that include
compatible occupational codes. In economics, O*Net data on the task content of occupations has
been used in studies of occupational employment losses related to the risk of automation (Autor,
Levy, and Murnane 2003; Frey and Osborne 2017) and the relationship between occupational task
content and offshoring risks (Blinder 2009). Sociologists have used this data for similar purposes,
especially in studies of occupation-level drivers of earnings disparities (Carbonaro 2007; Farkas,
England, Vicknair, and Kilbourne 1997; Grodsky and Pager 2001; Liu and Grusky 2013; Weeden
2002; Williams and Bol 2018).
In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, O*Net occupational tasks and work activities data has
proven relevant in a different way. O*Net data can be used to construct measures of occupational
risks of exposure to COVID-19. Accordingly, Gamio (2020) has combined U.S. labour force data
with two variables from the O*Net database to measures differences in the risk of exposure to
COVID-19 across occupations. In Canada, results based on this approach were also published by
Vu and Malli (2020). The O*Net variables are (1) the level of physical proximity to other people,
and (2) the frequency of overall exposure to diseases and infections. These two variables do not
directly measure the risk of infection to COVID-19. The first measure provides information about
close physical proximity with other people, which is an important channel for contracting COVID19, and the second measure provides more direct information on the frequency of exposure to
individuals who have infections or diseases. In the context of an infectious disease epidemic,
occupations scoring high on this second measure could be considered as facing a higher probability
of interaction in the workplace with individuals infected by the COVID-19. Note that the same
methodology can be used to study occupational risks of exposure to other infectious diseases
following similar transmission mechanisms than COVID-19.
In this paper, I leverage this approach to ask how occupational risks of exposure to COVID-19
varies across sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, education, immigration status, visible
minority status and Aboriginal identity). This approach does not rely on epidemiological data, and
the results cannot be used to infer population-level probabilities or rates of infection, especially to
the extent that transmission also occurs in settings other than workplaces, and among nonemployed individuals.3 The approach is nevertheless justified by the fact that while public health
data allow to investigate differences in rates of infection, hospitalization or death by gender and
age (Public Health Agency of Canada 2020; Purdie, Hawkes, Buse, Onarheim, Aftab, Low, et al.
2020), the absence of a systematic collection of measures of education, employment status and job
characteristics in COVID-19 epidemiological data means that limited statistical evidence exists on
the role of work-related factors in those disparities at the population level.4

3

Differences between groups in rates of hospitalization, admission to Intensive Care Units (ICU) and death are
likely to be driven to significant extent by epidemiological risk factors such as chronic health conditions (Public
Health Agency of Canada 2020), which cannot be inferred from data on occupational risks of exposure. For such
reasons, estimates of the distribution of occupational risks of exposure to COVID-19 by gender and age may not
match epidemiological data.
4

In Canada, the available evidence on work-related infections predominantly comes from news reports (Keller and
Dobby 2020).

6

The occupational scores should be interpreted as capturing the level of risk of exposure to COVID19 (or other similar infectious diseases) at work that results from close physical interaction with
colleagues, customers or other individuals, and from exposure to diseases or infections (in this
case, COVID-19). Without physical distancing and other prevention measures, these
characteristics are likely to increase the risk of transmission. Importantly, the scores do not account
for the impact of physical distancing measures or other adaptation in the organization of
workplaces, or the degree of compliance of different establishments with public health guidelines.
Instead, the results may be used to better target interventions by governments and employers aimed
at decreasing risks of transmission of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 during different
phases of an epidemic (including the progressive lifting of emergency measures mandating
workplace closures).
On a more theoretical level, the objective of this paper is to contribute to an understanding of the
health repercussions of the occupation-level bundling of job tasks in order to shed light on this
understudied health-related dimension of the stratification literature. For example, occupational
sorting plays an important role in explaining the gender wage gap in Canada (Schirle 2015; Waite
2017) and the U.S. (Blau and Kahn 2017; England 2010). Accordingly, I also ask whether
sociodemographic differences in occupational exposure risks are driven by sorting into broad
occupations with different average scores.
DATA AND METHODS
The two variables used in this paper are based on simple questions that ask respondents to rate
their work activities along ordinal scales. The score of respondents are averaged, and the variables
available from the O*Net database are continuous scores from 0 to 100 that can be mapped onto
the ordinal response categories. The Physical Proximity variable is based on the following
question: “To what extent does this job require the worker to perform job tasks in close physical
proximity to other people?”, with results reported a scale from going from 0 “I don't work near
other people (beyond 100 ft.)” to 100 “Very close (near touching)” with a total of five ordinal
response categories divided by equal intervals of 25 points. The Exposure to Disease or Infections
variable asks “How often does this job require exposure to disease/infections?” on a scale from 0
“Never” to 100 “Everyday” designed with the same cut off values at 25 points intervals. The
unweighted correlation between the two scores at the 4-digit occupation level is 0.5320. More
details on the content of these variables and the construction of the scores based on ordinal scales
is available in Table 1, below. In addition to the two O*Net-derived occupational scores, I compute
a “composite occupational risk score” combining both measures using a method proposed in
Kikuchi and Khurana (2020). This is an additive score that assumes independence in the impact of
each work activity.
Each detailed Canadian occupation coded using the 2016 National Occupational Classification
system (NOC 2016) can be matched to an O*Net score from a corresponding U.S. occupation for
both measures, using a correspondence table developed by the Brookfield Institute on Innovation
and Entrepreneurship (Vu 2019). This crosswalk was constructed manually, based on the

7

correspondence in the content of the O*Net and NOC 2016 occupation descriptions.5 While the
O*Net dataset is U.S.-specific, I assume that most occupations in Canada and the U.S. share similar
characteristics, especially in terms of physical proximity and exposure to infection or diseases. In
making that assumption, I follow several Canadian studies that adopted a similar approach to map
O*Net occupational scores onto NOC 2011 and NOC 2016 occupational codes. For example, a
mapping of O*Net scores on the Labour Force Survey NOC 2011 classification was used to study
the relationship between O*Net manual and cognitive job task requirements and job match quality
in Canada (Summerfield 2014, 2016), and a mapping on the National Household Survey NOC
2011 classification was developed by Statistics Canada in studies of the job skill intensity of
different groups of the Canadian population (Frenette and Frank 2017, 2018). Finally, the
crosswalk used in this paper was leveraged in a report on the composition of the Canadian tech
workforce (Vu, Lamb, and Zafar 2019). O*Net scores were also mapped on data from all European
countries included in the European Labour Force Survey from 1993 to 2006 to study the drivers
of job polarization (Goos, Manning, and Salomons 2009).
The results presented in this paper are based on public-use data estimates from the Canadian Longform Census of Population, 2016.6 At the time of writing, this was only the available source of
data with the sufficient level of disaggregation (4-digit occupations).7 It requires assuming that the
composition of the workforce in 2020 (occupations, labour force characteristics) is similar to the
reference period for data collection (occupation in May 2016, or last occupation for jobless
individuals). The sample includes all individuals who were at least 15 years old on Census day
(May 10, 2016) and reported employment income for the fiscal year 2015 (worked any number of
hours, part-year or full-year).
The dataset observations are population-weighted frequencies of respondents reporting non-zero
employment income in 2015 in each 4-digit NOC 2016 occupation, broken down by the following
sociodemographic characteristics: sex, immigration status (other tables used in this paper instead
include a variable on members of a visible minority group or on Aboriginal identity),8 age group
(15-24, 25-54, 55-64, and 65 or more years old), and highest degree attained. Other variables
include mean and median annual employment income in 2015 at the occupation level, broken
down by the same sociodemographic characteristics. The dataset is used to produce descriptive
cross-tabulations and to estimate ordinary least-square regressions models of the association
between sociodemographic characteristics and the three occupational exposure risk measures. The
data does not include measures of detailed job characteristics (non-standard employment contract,
firm size, etc.) because these variables are not collected in the 2016 Long-form Census.

A small number of NOC 2016 occupations representing less than 1 percent of the employed population in 2015
cannot be matched to an O*Net-SOC occupation. The program files are available on Github at:

At the time of writing, access to Long-form Census micro-data from Statistics Canada’s Research Data Centres
was suspended because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This restriction is unlikely to have an impact on the
findings presented in this paper. The public-use files are sufficient to answer the research questions formulated in
this study.

AGREGATE SCORE DISTRIBUTION ON ORDINAL SCALE
The scale for each variable an ordinal scale mapped onto a continuous scale ranging from 0 to 100,
with five distinct cut-off points each corresponding to an ordinal response category that guides
respondent answers. Table 1 presents the distribution of occupational scores weighted by the
number of employees in each occupation, based on the ordinal scale ratings. Each category
includes all occupations with a score falling in a 25 points band around the cut-off point (plus or
minus 12.5 points around the cut-off value, with the bottom and top categories censored in one
direction), meaning that occupational scores are rounded to the nearest cut-off value.

Note: Occupation score values are rounded to nearest score value cutoff. Each category
includes those in a range of +/- 12.5 points around score value.

In the top panel of Table 1, I show that the majority of Canadian workers are in occupations that
require being slightly close (51.8 percent), such as sharing an office. In addition, another 39.0
percent are in occupations that require working in moderately close proximity to other people (at
arm’s length, or below the physical distancing COVID-19 requirements). In other words, 90
percent of workers in Canada work in occupations that require some physical proximity. An

9

additional 7.2 percent are in occupations that require being very close (near touching). This is
evidence that establishment closures or job redesign may be necessary to avoid COVID-19
transmission at work. Meanwhile, approximately half (49.2 percent) of Canadian workers are in
occupations where they are never exposed to infections or diseases, and 8.3 percent are in
occupations where they are exposed at least every week. The remaining 42.5 percent are in
occupations that require being exposed to diseases or infections once a month or less. This means
that small but non-negligible share of the Canadian workforce is employed in occupations likely
to involve frequent contacts with individuals infected by COVID-19. Due to the concentration of
the responses into a few categories, the remainder of this paper reports average occupational scores
and other distributional statistics relying on continuous scores, in order to identify if certain
segments of the workforce experience higher occupational risks of exposure to COVID-19.
Histograms showing the full distribution of the scores, weighted by occupational employment, are
included in the Appendix. Table 1 also reports counts. Note that due to the treatment of missing
values, the exclusion of workers without employment income in 2015, as well as random rounding
to 0 for small cells, the total population count may differ across tables in this paper.
DISTRIBUTIONAL STATISTICS BY SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS
Distributional statistics for the numerical occupational scores by sociodemographic category are
presented in tables 2 to 4. Table 4 also reports the population distribution across groups (based on
Census weighted frequencies, which are estimates of population counts). The distributional
statistics for different groups are weighted by the variable reporting the number of employed
respondents in that group in 2015 in each occupation.
Gender
The results show important gender differences. Tables 2 and 3 show that on average, men work in
occupations that have both lower physical proximity score (-4.2 points) and lower exposure to
disease or infections scores (-12.3 points, or approximately 50 percent of the value for women).
Similarly, large gender differences are found for median scores, and an important gap is found
between the 75th percentile score values. Note that the distribution for the second variable is
skewed to the left with several outliers with high values (in health occupations), translating into
large differences between the mean and median score. The results for both scores yield a large
average composite risk score difference between men and women (see Table 4).
Immigration status, visible minority, and Aboriginal identity
There are little systematic differences in the average values for all scores between Canada-born
and immigrant workers. Similarly, limited percentile distribution differences are found, with
immigrant workers scoring 3.7 points lower on the median risk of exposure to diseases or
infections than Canadian-born workers. This small difference is meaningful given the compressed
distribution of the score on this variable. However, the values for the 75th percentile are the same
on that measure, at 29.0, suggesting that the share of workers in occupations at frequent risk of
exposure to infections or diseases (more than every year, approximately) is similar in both groups.
The same pattern is found when comparing members of visible minority groups with those who

10

are not. In contrast, distributional statistics for First Nations people, Métis and Inuit each show
higher average and median physical proximity and exposure to disease and infection scores than
those with a non-Aboriginal identity (one exception is the gap between Inuit and non-Aboriginal
physical proximity scores, which is visible at the median but not the mean). Gaps are especially
large for the risk of occupational exposure to diseases or infections. This translates into gaps in
mean and median composite scores as well.

Notes: The data is obtained from Statistics Canada catalogue no. 98-400-X2016355, except results by visible minority and by
Aboriginal identity, obtained from Statistics Canada catalogue no. 98-400-X2016356 and 98-400-X2016357, respectively.

Age group
Table 2 shows that younger workers (15-24 years old) are employed in occupations that have a
higher average physical proximity score than other age groups, at 66.2 points. Prime-age workers
score at 60.6. The values for the older age groups (55 to 64 years old and 65 or more years old)
are slightly below 60 points. Younger workers also have the highest median physical proximity

12

occupational score, at 68.5 points (a gap of 10 points or more with workers in all other age groups).
Differences are visible at the 25th percentile and to a lesser extent at the 75th percentile as well.
On the other hand, Table 3 shows that younger workers have a slightly lower average exposure to
disease or infections score than other age groups (-1.3 to -1.9 difference compared to older age
groups). In contrast, they have a higher median occupational score, alongside 65 years old or more
workers, suggesting that the share of young workers in occupations with very high scores is small,
although the overall distribution may lean towards higher scores. These patterns translate into a
2.8 to 4.0 negative difference in average composite risk score between younger workers and
workers in other age groups, as reported in Table 4, and similar differences in median composite
risk scores. This means that results based on the composite risk score may mask important
dynamics such as the contrasting relationship between age and the two scores.
Highest degree attained
I find meaningful differences in occupational risk scores by education. First, those with a
university certificate, diploma or degree at bachelor level or above have a lower average physical
proximity score than all other groups by two to three points (Table 2). Differences in median scores
are substantially larger, suggesting the presence of certain high-scoring occupations among
otherwise low-scoring occupations for highly educated workers (also see the larger interquartile
range in the last two columns of table 2). Workers with no certificate, diploma or degree, those
with apprenticeship or trades certificate or diploma, and with college, CEGEP or other nonuniversity certificate or diploma have substantially higher mean and median scores.
Second, there is a positive relationship between educational attainment and occupational exposure
to disease or infections score (Table 3). College, CEGEP, and university-educated workers have a
higher average risk score, likely associated with working in a healthcare sector job. Educationrelated differences in median scores are smaller, and percentile distribution differences are mostly
visible in the values for the 75th percentile value, meaning that more highly educated workers are
more likely to work in occupations that are among those requiring the most frequent exposure to
diseases or infections. Again, the contrasting patterns for the two measures translate into little
difference by education in the mean composite risk score and lower median values (but no
difference at the 75th percentile) for more educated workers, as shown in Table 4.
Broad occupational categories
Finally, results by broad occupational categories (1-digit) are reported. Table 2 shows that health
occupations have very high mean and median physical proximity scores relative to other
occupations, at 86.5 points compared to an average of 61.1 points for all workers (first row of
Table 2). The interquartile range bounds (25th and 75th percentiles are also very high, with 75
percent of workers in health occupations scoring above 85.5 points, above at least 75 percent or
workers in any other occupation (the 75th percentile of all other occupations is below 85 points).
Sales and services occupations and occupations in education, law and social, community and
government services also have high mean and median scores, while professional occupations
(management, business, finance, and administration, and natural and applied sciences occupations)
score the lowest.

Table 3 shows that health occupations also score very high on exposure to diseases or infections
with a mean score of 82.2 and a median score of 86.3 points. The 25th percentile value indicates
that at least 75 percent of workers in healthcare occupations are exposed to diseases or infections
at least once a week, consistent with what one would expect for workers in such occupations. The
14

gap in median and mean scores with other occupations is of 50 points or more. Occupations in
education, law and social, community and government services, and sales and services occupations
again have the second and third highest mean and median scores. Those in manufacturing and
utilities occupations score the lowest (most workers are almost never exposed). The occupational
patterns are relatively consistent for both scores, translating into similar results for the composite
risk score.
REGRESSION ANALYSIS
The distributional statistics reported above provide evidence of important differences in
occupational risks of exposure to infectious diseases such as COVID-19 by gender, age, Aboriginal
identity, education and broad occupational category. In order to distinguish the net role of each
variable in driving occupational exposure risk differences across the labour force, I provide
estimates from multivariate analysis (ordinary least square regressions) in Table 5. This method is
used to identify the net association between worker characteristics and average occupational risk
scores because different worker characteristics may be correlated. The standard tables used in this
analysis are available at the aggregate level rather than as microdata. Therefore, the dataset is
formed of cells of individual-level observations aggregated into all sex-age group-educationimmigration status configuration9 for each 4-digit NOC occupations. This yields a dataset of
47,450 observations. Each cell is weighted using its population frequency estimates. The
dependent variables are the three O*Net occupation risk of exposure scores attributed to each 4digit NOC occupation.
In a first set of models, each occupational risk score is regressed on gender, immigration status,
age group and highest degree attained. These models are under the first column under each score
type (models 1, 3 and 5). The estimates are consistent with descriptive results, with large gender
differences and little differences by immigration background for all occupational scores. No
statistically significant age difference is found for the exposure to disease or infections risk score,
and younger workers (15-24 years old) have a substantially and significantly higher average
occupational physical proximity risk score than the three other age groups. That pattern is also
found, muted, in the composite risk score estimates. Lastly, the estimates by highest degree
attained are also consistent with the patterns identified in the descriptive analysis. The physical
proximity score of workers with apprenticeship or trades certificate or diploma is significantly
higher than those with no certificate, diploma or degree, while it is significantly lower for those
with a university certificate, diploma or degree at bachelor level or above. In contrast, the exposure
to infections or diseases score is higher for more educated workers than those without a certificate,
diploma or degree, although the difference is only significant for those with a college, CEGEP or
other non-university certificate or diploma, and with a university certificate or diploma below
bachelor level. Overall, statistical significance is low or null for most education estimates,
suggesting little net role for this variable.

Additional results presented in Tables A5 and A6 report estimates based on aggregate data allowing sex-age groupeducation-visible minority and sex-age group-education-Aboriginal identity configurations, respectively. These are
reported separately because publicly available data does allow configurations combining immigration status, visible
minority status and Aboriginal identity together.

A categorical variable capturing the 1-digit broad occupational category of each observation is
introduced in a second set of regression models. These models are reported in the second column
under each score type (models 2, 4 and 6). They accomplish the following two objectives. First,
they provide estimates of the net association between different occupations and the risk scores.
Second, the provide some evidence on the role of occupational differences as a mechanism driving
other group differences. More specifically, if the regression coefficients on gender, immigration,
age and education decrease in size, I conclude that those group differences are explained by the
sorting of workers with different characteristics in broad occupations with different average scores.
Results for these models show that the coefficients for women decrease by a substantial amount
(by two thirds for physical proximity and 75 percent for exposure to infections or diseases),
approximately), while the coefficients for age in models using physical proximity and the
composite score as a dependent variable become less negative. This means that gender and age
differences are partially explained by the fact that women and younger workers are employed in
broad occupational categories with higher average occupational risk scores. Most notably, the
second and third rows of the last column of tables A1 to A4 show that women are strongly overrepresented in the three broad occupational categories with the highest occupational risks of
exposures (60 percent of workers in those occupations or more), while men are over-represented
in the remaining occupations.
The results for education are also noteworthy in the case of the model using exposure to diseases
and infections as a dependent variable. The coefficients for workers with a college or university
education change sign (from positive to negative), meaning that when controlling for occupations,
workers with a higher level of education have a lower risk of exposure to diseases or infections
than those without a secondary degree. The differences between models 3 and 4 can be interpreted
as showing that although workers with a higher level of education work in broad occupations that
have a higher average exposure to diseases or infections risk score (likely healthcare sector
occupations), within each broad occupational categories they are in 4-digit occupations that have
a lower average risk score than less educated workers.
Finally, note that the coefficients on the 1-digit occupations dummies are almost all statistically
significant and negative (results are relative to Sales and services occupations, which is used as
the reference category), and estimates for Health occupations are large and positive. These results
are consistent with the distributional statistics reported in the previous section.10
DISPARITIES IN RISKS OF EXPOSURE WITHIN HIGH-RISK OCCUPATIONAL
GROUPINGS
Because of the high score on the exposure to diseases and infections in health occupations, I report
specific regression results in Table 6 for the 1.2 million Canadians who work in health
occupations11 (NOC 2016 1-digit code 3). I do the same for two other occupational groupings that

10

Note that the R-squared are substantially higher in models controlling for 1-digit occupations, meaning that
variation in average occupational risks of exposure between 1-digit NOC codes explains a large share of the overall
variation in occupational risk of exposure to COVID-19 between 4-digit NOC codes and sociodemographic groups.

17

score high on all measures of occupational exposure risks: occupations in education, law and
social, community and government services (NOC 2016 1-digit code 4), and sales and services
occupations (NOC 2016 1-digit code 6). Results for the seven residual broad occupational
categories grouped together are also reported in Table 6. Occupational risk of exposure scores are
regressed on gender, immigration status, age and education separately for each of these four
occupational groupings. For the residual, Other NOC codes subsample, a model with controls for
broad occupational category is also estimated. Distributional statistics for each subsample are
reported in Tables A1 to A4.
First, the results show that gender differences are muted for both scores, consistent with the
findings from the previous section. No statistically significant difference between men and women
is found in health occupations (Table A1 shows high score values across all distributional statistics
in these occupations). In the residual occupations subsample (Other NOC column), women have a
lower physical proximity score than men by 3 points, while the opposite pattern is found in NOC
4 and NOC 6. These results suggest that the gender gap in physical proximity score is explained
by the fact that high-risk occupations are also highly feminized. The same interpretation can be
applied to the regression results for the exposure to infections or diseases score, although no
statistically significant gender difference is found in any of the three high-risk occupational
groupings.
Meanwhile, outside of the three high-risk occupations, physical proximity is higher in maledominated occupations (1-digit broad occupational categories), as shown when comparing the
second column for the residual subsample (Other NOC, 2) with the first column for the residual
subsample regression. Once controlling for occupations, the difference between men and women
is approximately 0 and is not statistically significant. This may be explained by the higher share
of men in the higher-scoring occupations of the residual category such as trades, natural resources,
agriculture, and manufacturing occupations. The opposite is true for exposure to infections or
diseases: in the Other NOC subsample, the score for women is higher by five points, a statistically
significant and substantial gap, given the intercept estimate of 12.1 (constant).
Second, the age gradient in physical proximity scores distinguishing younger workers (15-24 years
old) from others in aggregate results reported in Table 5 is not visible in health occupations (NOC
3) or occupations in education, law and social, community and government services (NOC 4). On
the other hand, older workers have a higher score than other age groups for frequency of exposure
to diseases or infections by four to five points, suggesting that older workers in health occupations,
including the approximately 260,000 workers age 55 years old or more (20 percent of workers in
health occupations), are at higher risk of exposure to the COVID-19 based on that measure. The
age difference is only statistically significant when comparing older workers (65 years old or more)
to the youngest age group (15-24 years old workers). Older workers also score higher in NOC 4
and NOC 6 although the differences with 15-24 years old workers are generally not statistically
significant. In the Other NOC subsample, prime-age workers (25-54 years old) score the lowest,
with a statistically significant difference with 15-24 years old workers of more than 2 points.

Note that this does not include individuals who work in non-health occupations in the healthcare sector (in a
business or organization primarily operating in the healthcare sector).

Third, workers with any type of university degree have a lower occupational risk of exposure
compared to less educated workers across both measures and all occupational groupings, except
for health occupations and, in the case of physical proximity scores, for sales and services
occupations. Following a social closure and social constructionist approach (Attewell 1990;
Collins 1979; Grusky and Weeden 2001) may help understanding how health occupations
requiring a higher level of education are associated with a high frequency of exposure to diseases
or infections and high level of physical proximity while the opposite is true outside for other
occupations. Proximity with patients with poor health such as the one required for surgeons or
other medical specialties is central to the occupational identity of healthcare professionals and to
boundary definitions and closure among healthcare professionals. Meanwhile, exposure to
diseases or infections may simply represent an occupational health and safety risk in other
occupations, which high-status (more highly educated) occupational incumbents are able to avoid.
Lastly, separate results by occupational groupings do not show any statistically significant
difference between immigrants and Canadian-born workers, with the exception of exposure to
infections or diseases in the Other NOC subsample, where immigrants are found to have a lower
score than Canada-born workers.12
LOW-INCOME OCCUPATIONS
The last set of findings reported in this paper focus on workers in low-income occupations. Lowincome workers may be at greater risk of infection to COVID-19 and subsequent complications
than other workers because they are likely to face strong financial disincentives to be absent from
work (low savings and precarious financial situation) even if they contract the virus or if they are
in a group at higher risks of mortality following an infection to COVID-19 (older individuals,
those with chronic health conditions or respiratory diseases, etc.). This is especially true in cases
where they do not have access to paid sick leaves (the data does not include any measure of access
to sick leaves however, and provinces such as Ontario do not mandate paid sick leaves; selfemployed workers such as those employed in the gig economy also lack employer-sponsored paid
sick leaves) or other forms of income support in cases of absence from work for health-related
reasons.
In the absence of public-use individual-level employment income micro-data with detailed
measures of occupations, median occupational employment income is used as a proxy for being in
a low-income job. Table 7 reports the distribution of workers in low-income and non low-income
12

In addition, Table A1 shows that immigrants in health occupations have a slightly higher mean occupational risk
of exposure to diseases or infections than Canadian-born workers (1.2 point), but a substantially lower median value
(by 3.8 points). This suggests an overall distribution towards higher occupational scores among immigrants, but an
under-representation of immigrants among the highest-scoring occupations, namely nurses, physicians and other
healthcare professionals with frequent interactions with patients. This is possibly due to the fact that those
occupations have high barriers to the international transfer of credentials, limiting the ability of immigrants educated
abroad in those professions to enter them in Canada. A similar difference in median gap is observed for women,
possibly driven by the lower score of some female-dominated health occupations. Note that within health
occupations for example, physicians, dentist and veterinarians have an average exposure to diseases or infections
score of 93.7, while it is 30 points below at 63.5 for therapy and assessment professionals. Therefore, heterogeneity
in occupational risks of exposure is also found within broad occupational groupings.

21

occupations in the overall quartile distribution for the three different risk scores. Low-income
occupations are occupations with median annual employment income below 50 percent of the
Canadian median annual employment income value ($37,231 among all those who were employed
at any time in 2015). In other words, workers in an occupation with a median annual employment
income value below $18,615.50 are classified as working in a low-income occupation. No
adjustment is made for annual work hours because part-time or part-year employment status is an
aspect of economic precarity (this paper is not focusing on the labour market returns to specific
skills and for that reason, differences in hourly wages are less important than differences in annual
earnings).
The results in table 7 show that 1,730,835 Canadian workers in the sample are in a low-income
occupation, or 10.4 percent of all sample observations. A much higher share of workers in lowwage occupations work in occupations at the top of the physical proximity score distribution. More
specifically, more than 95 percent of low-income workers are in jobs in the top half of the physical
proximity score distribution. Meanwhile, only 43.1 percent of workers who are not in a lowincome occupation are in the top half of that distribution. A similar pattern is found for the
exposure to infections or diseases score, although in a more muted way, possibly because higherpaying health occupations are over-represented in the top half of the distribution. The composite
score results show that 29.9 percent of all low-income workers are in the bottom half of the
distribution, while a little more than 50 percent of workers not in a low-income occupation are in
the bottom half of the distribution.
Estimates are also reported separately for men and women in Table 7. The higher overall
occupational exposure risk scores for women reported in previous sections translate in a greater
share of women in the highest quartile both inside and outside of low-income occupations.
Strikingly, 57.8 percent of women in low-income occupations are in the top quartile of the physical
proximity score distribution. Results in Tables A7 to A9 show a higher share of workers in lowincome occupations in the 4th quartile of the physical proximity score distribution among
immigrant than Canadian-born workers and among members of visible minority groups than
workers who are not. For First Nations people and Métis, a higher concentration of workers in the
4th quartile of the exposure to infections or diseases score distribution is found among workers
who are not in low-income occupations than non-Aboriginals. The same pattern is found when
comparing Inuit and non-Aboriginal workers in low-income occupations. Otherwise little
difference is found between non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal people working in low-income
occupations.
These results highlight the association between socioeconomic status and occupational-level work
activities that may increase the risk of exposure to COVID-19, and more so among women,
immigrants and members of visible minority groups. This matters in terms of baseline risk of
exposure, but also highlights the importance of preventive measures against contraction and
transmission in the workplace, such as ensuring that workers who suspect they may have been
infected or who tested positive do not face disincentives to stay at home in isolation.

DISCUSSION
While this study considers occupational risks of exposure to COVID-19 using measures of job
tasks and activities at the detailed level, it faces some limitations. Importantly, employers have
reacted in at least two ways to the pandemic, in line with public health guidelines and directives
as well as with the impact of the pandemic on the economy. First, a large number of establishments
have ceased their activities, as a result of a decrease in demand and of the subsequent establishment
closures mandated by provincial governments across the country. As a consequence, workers in a
large number of occupations are absent from work or on layoff or furlough (Statistics Canada
2020b). Therefore, the 2016 data used for this study does not account for the recent developments
in that area since the beginning of the pandemic, which may compound the impact of differences
over time in the composition of the workforce on the estimates presented in this study. Further
analysis with data from the Labour Force Survey could allow the estimation of the impact of
mandated establishment closures and various forms of cessation of activities on the aggregate
distribution of occupational risk of exposure as well as on group differences.
Despite this limitation, the results presented in this note have important longer-term implications.
As emergency measures mandating establishment closures in specific sectors are progressively
lifted without a complete eradication of COVID-19 in the population, this note shows which
workers are likely to face higher risks of exposure when (or if) returning to work. These segments
of the workforce may especially benefit from enhanced preventive, protective and adaptative
measures by governments and employers in that context. The ability to identify the high-risk
occupations is therefore important to determine what type of workplaces may require greater
monitoring, efforts at physical distancing and other measures during all phases of a pandemic.
Second, a large number of employers have implemented policies allowing employees to work from
home, and survey evidence shows that 3.3 million employed Canadians who usually work outside
of their home completed most of their work hours from home during the week of April 12, 2020
(Statistics Canada 2020b). The relationship between physical proximity requirements (as
measured by O*Net) and the ability to work from home is not straightforward because existing
technology allows online face-to-face discussion through teleconferencing software as well as a
broad range of other forms of live communication and interactions. Nevertheless, a few approaches
have been used to measure the feasibility of remote work across occupations (Dingel and Neiman
2020; Gascon 2020), which may allow future research to estimate the impact of an unevenly
distributed shift to remote work on disparities in occupational risks of exposure to COVID-19.
Note that the redesign of occupational task content in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic cannot
be fully accounted for using a static database such as O*Net, and more timely data on transition to
remote work may be necessary.
Finally, addressing the impact of these recent labour market trends on occupational task content
and on the distribution of those tasks will be instrumental in achieving a more accurate
understanding of the risk of occupational exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace across different
segments of the labour force. Nevertheless, the job design and task allocation of employees who
perform similar work can vary substantially across organizations (Appelbaum, Bailey, Berg, and
Kalleberg 2000; Cohen 2013). In fact, variation in the ability of different organizations to adapt,
transform, and reassemble jobs may be observable across dimensions other than occupations.

24

While the ability to redesign jobs towards remote work may depend on certain occupational
characteristics, studies of the impact of organizational reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic (job
reassembly/redesign) on the exposure risk of workers may gain to take into account these other
sources of variation.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, I use data on occupational work activities from the O*Net combined with Canadian
2016 Census data to show that approximately 45 percent of Canadian workers are in occupations
that require performing duties in relatively close physical proximity to others (at arm’s length or
closer). A smaller share of workers are in occupations with a regular frequency of exposure to
diseases or infections (around 8 percent of them are in occupations with exposure once a week or
more). These measures are used as indicators of the risk of exposure to COVID-19 in the
workplace for Canadians working in various occupations. The methods and findings can also be
relevant for studies of occupational risks of exposure to other infectious diseases similar to
COVID-19 that may be transmitted when individuals are in close physical proximity.
I find important disparities by sociodemographic characteristics, notably by gender, age, education
and broad occupational category. In addition, workers in low-income occupations are found to be
especially vulnerable to COVID-19 exposure and transmission. These results contribute to identify
which workers are at higher risk of exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace and help policymakers formulate decisions about the design of specific public health and occupational health and
safety interventions, the closure of certain establishments, and the creation of related incomesupport measures in reaction to the current pandemic. Following Bignami-van Assche, Ghio, and
van Assche (2020), this study highlights the importance of focusing on age differences when
considering government interventions focusing on essential workers and confinement.
The evidence showing lower risks of exposure among university-educated workers compared to
less educated workers in most non-health occupations (as well as college, CEGEP and other nonuniversity postsecondary-educated workers in some broad occupational groupings) also has the
potential to contribute to the literature on the education-health gradient (Zajacova and Lawrence
2018). At the same time, the absence of an education-risk of exposure gradient among the (higherpaid) health occupations point at the existence of “pockets of complexity” in this relationship
(Schieman and Koltai 2017). The initial findings reported in this research note can be leveraged in
future studies on the relationship between different measures of socioeconomic status and health
focusing specifically on COVID-19 or other similar infectious diseases.
Finally, this paper offers a more general insight into the relationship between occupational tasks
and labour market stratification. Recent research has predominantly focused on abstract (cognitive,
routine, social, etc.) and on manual or physical aspects of occupational activities and tasks in terms
of the earnings associated with those skills. In contrast, this paper highlights how components of
the physical aspect of work activities have an important impact on risks in the workplace and on
job quality that are distinct from the labour market rewards for different skills and abilities.
