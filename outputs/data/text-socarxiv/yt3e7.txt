Abstract
During the covid-19 pandemic, face masks have been recommended by the CDC
and the WHO as key to reducing viral transmission. Yet, in the United States, one
fifth of individuals say they wear masks at most some of the time, and a majority say
that people in their community wear masks at most some of the time. What strategies
most effectively encourage compliance with this critical covid-19 prevention measure?
Relying on social identity theory, we experimentally assess two possible mechanisms
of compliance, elite endorsement and social norms, among a representative sample
of White U.S.–born Evangelicals, a group that has shown resistance to prevention
measures. We find evidence for both mechanisms, but social norms play a remarkably
important role – increasing support for mask-wearing by 6% with spillover effects on
other prevention guidelines. Our findings confirm the role that appeals to norms and
elite endorsements play in shaping individual behavior, and offer lessons for public
health messaging.

Introduction

As of 6 January 2021, the covid-19 pandemic has claimed over 1.86 million lives and infected
more than 86 million people worldwide, putting this public health emergency on track to be
the most deadly in over a century.1 A striking feature of the ongoing pandemic is the absence
of clear and consistent public health recommendations by local and national governments. In
the United States, for example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends
such measures as hand washing, physical distancing, and mask wearing, but local jurisdictions throughout the country do not uniformly condone or enforce these policies. Former
U.S. President Donald Trump has himself provided inconsistent messages on the necessity
and efficacy of these measures.
The scientific consensus on the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of
the virus (Anfinrud et al. 2020; Lyu and Wehby 2020) contrasts with contentious reactions
across the US political landscape. A majority of Americans report that they wear face masks
in public, at most, “some of the time”. Strikingly, although 65% of Americans claim to wear
a mask when in stores or businesses all or most of the time, only 44% of Americans say that
others in the community where they live do so (Igielnik 2020). Today, wearing a mask has
become a partisan issue (Gadarian, Wallace, and Pepinsky 2020; Milosh et al. 2020).
Recent work in the behavioral, social, and psychological sciences informs us that while
this defiance of public health guidelines may seem puzzling on its face, it is strikingly consistent with social identity theories of behavior in which individuals prioritize the self-esteem
they receive from belonging to a social group. Scholars have shown just how powerful social
identity is in guiding individuals’ actions and beliefs, finding that when processing and integrating new information, individuals seek not accuracy, but rather affirmations of themselves
as members of a social group. This justification helps us understand motivated reasoning, or
the process by which individuals seek out and more readily accept information that confirms

their priors (Kahan 2016). From this perspective, the partisan divide over face masks is not
so much a puzzle, but a characteristic of the country’s intense partisan polarization.
In this paper, we draw on these insights to test how social identity can be leveraged to
encourage individual compliance with public health guidelines in a pandemic. Specifically,
relying on a survey experiment of White Evangelical Americans – one of the least compliant
groups in the country (Burge 2020; PRRI 2020) – we test two mechanisms that guide behavior
within social identity groups: the influence of in-group elites, and the powerful role of ingroup norms. Limiting our tests to a single social identity group allows us to hold several
other factors of cross-group analysis constant in order to examine precisely how social identity
might shape individual compliance.
The influence of religious elites on individual attitudes and behavior is well-documented in
the social science literature. Scholars find that religious elites play an outsized role in political
participation (McClendon and Riedl 2019), voting behavior (Green 2010), and compliance
with public health directives (Muñoz-Laboy et al. 2011).2 Alternatively, individuals may
take a cue not from their religious leader but from what they perceive to be acceptable
norms of behavior within their religious group. Ingroup norms are a powerful motivator of
individual behavior in many other contexts (Paluck and Shepherd 2012). Do they operate
similarly in the context of compliance with covid-19 prevention measures?
We test these hypotheses with a survey experiment on a representative sample of U.S.–
born White Evangelicals fielded in July 2020. Individuals are either assigned to a control
condition in which they receive basic public health recommendations to prevent covid-19, an
elite condition in which they receive the same recommendations plus a quote from an Evangelical leader (Reverend Franklin Graham) encouraging mask-wearing, or a norms condition
in which they receive the same recommendations plus a statement about the percentage
of White Evangelicals who have worn a mask in public (close to 80%). We then measure
respondents’ attitudinal, semi-behavioral, and behavioral support for mask wearing.
2

Some research suggests that Evangelical Christians may not respond to elite cues when these are overtly
political or when they come into tension with an overlapping, partisan, identity (Margolis 2018).

2

Both our elite and norms treatments significantly increased White Evangelicals’ expressed
support for mask wearing in public. However, it is our social norms treatment that had the
most consistently statistically significant effect. Not only did it increase expressed support
for mask wearing in public, it also increased support for social and physical distancing as
a prevention measure; further, it increased respondents’ likelihood of saying they would
be willing to sign a petition endorsing mask-wearing in public. We additionally find that
respondents whose religious motivation is their social identity – those who tell us their Church
is important to them first and foremost because they identify as Evangelical Christian –
respond more strongly to the norms treatment, and that the norms treatment was more likely
to convey new information to our respondents than was the elite endorsement. These results
clarify how social identity shapes individual compliance with public health recommendations.

The Power of Social Identity

Our theoretical intuition draws from Social Identity Theory, which argues that individuals
want to maximize their self-esteem and do so by favoring the social groups to which they
belong (Tajfel and Turner 1979). Social scientists have relied on this intuition to better
understand ingroup bias in a number of contexts, from voting (e.g., Bassi, Morton, and
Williams 2011), to partisan identity formation (e.g., Green, Palmquist, and Schickler 2004),
to policy preferences (e.g., Shayo 2009). We build on these insights by interrogating which
audiences individuals care about within these groups. Although much of the literature
on social norms assumes that individuals care about their peers, another literature on elite
endorsements suggests that individuals may care about their group leaders (e.g., Zaller 1992).
We test these intuitions in the context of compliance with mask-wearing and social distancing protocols to prevent the spread of covid-19. More specifically, we examine White
Evangelicals in the United States, a social group whose religious identity is highly salient –
especially as it compares to that of White Americans of other religions (Putnam and Camp-

3

bell 2006) – and one that is known for refusing to comply with covid-19 health guidelines
(Burge 2020; Smith 2020; PRRI 2020). Our study tests the below hypotheses:
Hypothesis H1 : White Evangelicals are more likely to support wearing facemasks in public
when they receive an ingroup elite endorsement of wearing facemasks in public.

Hypothesis H2 : White Evangelicals are more likely to support wearing facemasks in public
when they receive information that a majority of their peers wear facemasks in public.
In July 2020, we fielded a survey experiment with the Lucid marketplace on a sample of
1,780 White Evangelical American adults.3 Although a random sample of White Evangelicals
– while ideal – is prohibitively costly, we used quotas on gender, age, and US region to match
the demographic characteristics of US White Evangelicals according to the Pew Research
Center.4
The survey collects a number of pretreament covariates, assigns the treatment, and measures support for wearing facemasks in public. We test Hypotheses H1 and H2 via random
assignment to one of three conditions. In the control condition, respondents read a short
vignette describing a few facts about covid-19 transmission. These facts are taken from the
CDC website. In the endorsement condition testing H1 , this same set of facts was presented
with the addition of a statement by Evangelical leader Franklin Graham endorsing maskwearing. In the social norms condition testing H2 , the endorsement statement was replaced
by the statement that close to 80% of White Evangelicals have worn a mask in public. SI-A
provides a screenshot of each condition. Our source for Pastor Graham’s statement is a 10
April 2020 interview with the Charlotte Observer. Our source for the statistic that 80%
of White Evangelicals have worn a mask in public comes from the magazine Christianity
3

Recent research has shown that online survey experiments during the COVID-19 pandemic do not
suffer from significant changes in how subjects respond to treatments, and possibly generate smaller average
treatment effects due to increased inattentiveness (Peyton, Huber, and Coppock 2020). This would make it
more difficult to detect an effect that exists.
4
We relied on a series of screening questions at the beginning of our survey to obtain a sample of US
Born White Evangelicals: respondents qualified if they responded that they are not of Hispanic, Latino, or
Spanish origins, that they are White, that they are Protestant, that they are an Evangelical Christian, and
that they are a US citizen.

Today, which cites a covid-19 Tracking Poll from Data for Progress. For each vignette, we
also asked respondents whether they already knew the information, whether they did not
know it, or whether they did not believe it. We use this question as a measure of compliance
with treatment, identifying non-compliers as those who answered that they do not believe
the information.
We measure four outcomes, ranging from attitudinal to behavioral. A thermometer
question asks, on a scale of 0 to 10, how important the respondent believes wearing a mask
in public is for combatting the spread of covid-19. This is the outcome measure we use for
our power analysis. A second question asks the extent to which, on a scale from 1 (“Strongly
disagree”) to 5 (“Strongly agree”), the respondent agrees with a set of policies to mitigate
the spread of covid-19. Finally, a behavioral measure asks respondents how likely, on a scale
of 0 to 10, they would add their name to a Change.org petition endorsing mask-wearing in
public. If respondents answer 5 or higher, they are then given the option to click on the
petition URL, which is a decision we can track.

Results

Our sample consists of 1,780 U.S.–born White Evangelicals, 1,066 (59.89%) of whom identify
as female, 713 (40.06%) as male, and 1 as non-binary. The mean age in our sample is 54.23
years and roughly 68% of the sample identify as Republican, 16% identify as Democrats,
and the remaining 16% as Independents (SI-B). According to a 2015 Pew Research Poll, the
Evangelical population writ large has a median age of 49, is 55% female-identifying, and is
56% Republican (Pew Research Center 2015).
Who in our U.S.–born White Evangelical sample is more likely to wear a mask to begin
with? We know that, among the US population more broadly, women, racial minorities, older
individuals, and Democrats are more likely to support mask-wearing in public to prevent
the spread of the virus (Pew Research Center 2020). Our correlational analysis in SI-C

5

shows that older, more educated, and less Republican respondents are more likely to agree
with the importance of mask-wearing in public; these patterns hold in a multiple regression
framework.
We test hypotheses H1 and H2 with the below pre-registered specification:

yi = α + βTi + γXi + i

(1)

where yi is the outcome of interest for respondent i, β is the estimated treatment effect, Ti
is the assignment to treatment, Xi is a vector of demographic covariates, and i is the error
term. In our pre-analysis plan, we did not specify which demographic covariates to include
in Xi . We therefore include all pretreatment demographic controls.
Figure 1 illustrates our main results testing the elite endorsement and the norm conditions
relative to the control condition (see SI-D for regression tables). It indicates a significant
effect of our elite endorsement condition on a single outcome measure: the thermometer score
expressing support for wearing masks in public. And yet, for nearly every other outcome
measure that follows, the treatment effect is no longer statistically distinguishable from zero.
By contrast, the social norms message shows more statistically significant effects across a
variety of outcomes. Relative to the control condition conveying solely the CDC guidelines
at the time, the norms condition increases the respondent’s thermometer score in support
of mask-wearing in public; it also increases agreement with both mask-wearing and social
distancing as effective policies. Finally, though the effect is statistically significant only at
the 90% confidence level, the norms message increases the respondent’s expressed willingness
to sign a petition endorsing mask-wearing in public.
Substantively, the average treatment effects we uncover in both conditions are consistent
with similar studies on the determinants of mask-wearing and social distancing during covid19 (e.g., Rieger 2020). Our norms message increases respondents’ thermometer scores by 0.15
standard deviations on average, while the endorsement message increases thermometer scores
by 0.11 standard deviations.

Figure 1: Average Treatment Effects
Our pre-analysis plan also pre-registered a compliance analysis. After each treatment
condition, we asked respondents to tell us whether they already knew the information, or
whether they did not believe it. We then coded those who responded “I do not believe
this” as non-compliers and conduct a complier average causal effect (CACE) analysis in
SI-E. Our results hold. Finally, we registered a series of tests to investigate the social
identity mechanism we posit in this paper: if White Evangelicals can be moved to express
greater support for face masks through a social identity mechanism, then we should expect
respondents who identify as White Evangelical because it is their social identity to respond
more strongly to our treatments. In SI-G, we find that they do.5
Although our treatment effects are not statistically significantly different from one another, there is one crucial way in which they differed. In SI-H, we show that respondents were
less likely to already know the information provided by our norms treatment (49%) than that
provided by our elite treatment (81%). If “individuals are motivated to understand what
is normative in the communities to which they belong” (Tankard and Paluck 2016), then
changing a White Evangelical’s perception about what is normative in their community may

Conclusion

In this paper, we draw from social identity theory to test how White Evangelicals, a group
that has been less compliant with covid-19 prevention guidelines, can be persuaded to
follow a key health recommendation: wearing masks in public. Our results indicate that
both leader and peer audiences effectively shape compliant attitudes toward mask-wearing,
with more wide-ranging effect for the peer norms treatment. Additionally, our results show
that White Evangelicals did not know the extent to which their peers were already abiding by
this norm; by informing them of this, our vignette shaped perceptions around the existence
of this norm, motivating respondents to comply with it as well.
The effect of our elite vignette was less robust. Research has shown that the influence of
religious elites has its limits, particularly when elite positions deviate significantly from those
of group members on polarizing issues such as the environment or LGBT rights (e.g., Djupe
and Claassen 2018). In particular, Margolis (2018) shows that cross-pressures between Evangelical Christians’ Evangelical and Republican identities can be demobilizing. Alternatively,
White Evangelicals may seek out the view of their local religious leaders, rather than that of
national evangelical leaders (Djupe and Claassen 2018). As a result, our vignette may have
provided a cue from the “wrong” elite; future work should test whether cues from more local
Evangelical leaders are more effective.
Our findings have important implications for public health messaging, suggesting that
White Evangelicals may be more receptive to public health messaging when it is delivered
by in-group leaders. Our findings suggest, however, that it is most important for public
messaging to dispel myths around compliance among White Evangelicals. When White
Evangelicals learn that many members of their group do, in fact, comply with mask wearing
and other preventative measures, they may be more willing to follow suit.

Note: Each row presents coefficients from a model with all controls, in which the omitted category is the control condition for the relevant religion motivation respondents.
For example, for the first two rows, the omitted category is the control condition for respondents whose main religion motivation is social identity. For the next two rows,
the omitted cateogry is the control condition for respondents whose main religion motivation is insurance. Therefore, each pair of rows reports results from separate regressions.
See Tables F24-F29 for full models.

Can Religion Increase Compliance with covid-19 Prevention
Measures?
Pre-Analysis Plan

July 21, 2020
Abstract
Many local and national politicians disagree on which public health policies they support to mitigate
the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. In the absence of political consensus on how best to respond to the virus,
some individuals turn to other sources of guidance. Drawing from insights from the social and behavioral
sciences, we ask whether religious communities effectively influence individuals’ beliefs, attitudes, and
behaviors with regard to covid-19 public health guidelines. We field a survey experiment among White
Evangelicals in the United States—one of the least likely groups to adhere to social distancing guidelines—
to test whether religious elites on one hand, and ingroup norms on the other, can shape White Evangelical
beliefs and attitudes toward mask-wearing. The results of our study will help inform strategies for most
effectively communicating critical public health guidelines to skeptical groups.

Introduction

As of 1 July 2020, the covid-19 pandemic has claimed over 500,000 lives and infected more than 10.4 million
people worldwide, putting this public health emergency on track to be the most deadly in over a century.1
One of the most striking features of the ongoing pandemic is the absence of clear and consistent public
health recommendations by local and national governments. In the United States, for example, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention recommends such measures as hand washing, physical distancing, and
mask wearing, though local jurisdictions throughout the country do not uniformly condone or enforce these
policies. Indeed, states diverge from CDC guidelines even on reporting their case numbers.2 U.S. President
Donald Trump has himself provided inconsistent messages on the necessity and efficacy of these measures.
Without clear governmental guidelines on covid-19 prevention, religious leaders throughout the world
have stepped in to either promote or denounce various public health and safety measures.3 Alternatively,
individuals may turn to norms within their social groups for guidance on appropriate behavior. This project
investigates the extent to which religious groups—through the influence of their leaders and/or the impact
of ingroup social norms—can shape individual compliance with covid-19 public health guidelines.
The influence of religious elites on individual-level attitudes and behavior is well-documented in the
social science literature. Scholars find that religious elites play an outsized role in individual support for
democracy,4 political participation,5 and voting behavior.6 In the domain of public health, scholars note the
tremendous influence of religious leaders in both encouraging and discouraging compliance in anti-HIV and
anti-Malarial initiatives throughout sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.7 These findings suggest that
religious figures have the capacity to shift both attitudes and behavioral practices among congregants, which
leads to our first research question: (RQ1) To what extent does the endorsement of religious elites influence
co-religionists’ compliance with standard covid-19 prevention measures?
Alternatively, individuals may take a cue not from their religious leader but from what they perceive
to be acceptable norms of behavior within their religious group. Ingroup norms are a powerful motivator
of individual behavior in many other contexts8 , leading to our second research question: (RQ2) To what
extent do social norms within a religious group influence an individual’s compliance with standard covid19 prevention measures? Although we expect that both elite endorsements and social norms will impact
individual preferences and behavior, and we expect that these effects will significantly differ from each other,
we do not have any prior about which effect will be larger.
Additionally, this project seeks to understand the mechanisms driving the above effects. Specifically, it
considers two possible mechanisms—religiosity and religious motivations—that could enhance or reduce the
impact of religious elites and/or social norms on individual compliance with covid-19 prevention measures:
(RQ3) To what extent does religiosity increase or decrease the effect of elite endorsements and/or social
norms on individual compliance with covid-19 prevention measures? (RQ4) To what extent do various

religious motivations increase or decrease the effect of elite endorsements and/or social norms on individual
compliance with covid-19 prevention measures?
To measure religious motivations, we rely first on the extrinsic/intrinsic motivation scale first proposed
by Allport and Ross (1967) and further refined by Gorsuch and McPherson (1989).9 We also develop our
own taxonomy of religious motivations drawing from the rich social scientific literature on social identity.
We measure religiosity following Wilkes, Burnett, and Howell (1986):
1. To what extent do you agree with the following statements:
• I go to Church regularly
• Spiritual values are more important than material things
• If Americans were more religious, this would be a better country
2. Please evaluate your own feelings of religiousness. Are you very religious, moderately religious, slightly
religious, not at all religious, or anti-religious?
We measure the explicit / implicit religious motivation scale following Allport and Ross (1967) and
Gorsuch and McPherson (1989):
1. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statements?
• What religion offers me most is comfort in times of trouble and sorrow (extrinsic personal)
• My whole approach to life is based on my religion (intrinsic)
• I go to church mainly because I enjoy seeing people I know there (extrinsic social)
We develop our own taxonomy of religious motivation by asking respondents to rank order the below
statements from the statement they most agree with to the statement they least agree with:
1. Insurance-based motivation: “My Church is important to me because it helps me in times of personal
or financial need.”
2. Morality-based motivation: “My Church is important to me because following the advice of my Church
is the right thing to do.”
3. Social capital-based motivation: “My Church is important to me because that is where I find my family
close friends, and/or business partners.”
4. Heuristics-based motivation: “My Church is important to me because it makes it easier for me to reach
decisions about complicated things.”
5. Tradition-based motivation: “My Church is important to me because I was born into it and/or brought
up that way.”
6. Social identity-based motivation: “My Church is important to me because I identify as an Evangelical
Christian.”
We test each of these four research questions with the following hypotheses:
9 To economize survey length, we limit our scale to the three questions with highest loading on each of three factors: implicit
motivation, explicit personal motivation, and explicit social motivation.

(H1 ) Individuals who receive a religious elite message endorsing mask-wearing are more likely to comply
with mask-wearing than individuals who do not receive such an endorsement message (RQ1)
(H2 ) Individuals who receive an ingroup norm message about mask-wearing are more likely to comply with
mask-wearing than individuals who do not receive such an ingroup norm message (RQ2)
(H3 ) The effect of the religious elite endorsement message will differ from that of the ingroup norm message
(RQ1 and RQ2)
(H4 ) Individuals who self-identify as more religious are more likely to respond to both elite endorsement
and ingroup norm messages relative to individuals who self-report as less religious (RQ3)
(H5 ) Individuals with different religion motivations will respond differently to our treatments (RQ4). Specifically:
(H51 ) Individuals who self-report intrinsic motivations for religion, and individuals who self-report extrinsic personal motivations for religion, are more likely to respond to the elite endorsement
message than individuals who self-report extrinsic social motivations for religion (RQ4 – Gorsuch
and McPherson (1989) taxonomy)
(H52 ) Individuals who self-report intrinsic motivations for religion, and respondents who self-report
extrinsic personal motivations for religion are less likely to respond to the ingroup norm message
relative to respondents who self-report extrinsic social motivations for religion (RQ4 – Gorsuch
and McPherson (1989) taxonomy)
(H53 ) Individuals who self-report social identity, social capital, and insurance motivations for religion
will respond more strongly to the ingroup norm message than other respondents. Individuals
who self-report heuristics and morality motivations for religion will respond more strongly to the
endorsement message than other respondents (RQ4 – Author taxonomy)
We expect the effect of both treatments to increase with levels of religiosity (H4) because as the importance of religion in one’s life increases, so too should the importance of recommendations of leaders
and behavior of co-religious adherents. As to H5, individuals with extrinsic social motivations think of
the church as a venue to meet and interact with friends and acquaintances. Someone who values social
interactions should be more attentive to social norms because non-compliance might hinder their ability to
socialize. Therefore, we expect respondents with extrinsic social motivations to be more likely to respond
to the ingroup norm message relative to respondents with intrinsic and extrinsic personal motivations for
religion (H51 ).
Further, individuals with intrinsic motivations for religion base themselves on religious codes of conduct
when making life choices. Individuals with extrinsic personal motivations for religion find psychological
comfort in their faith. Religious leaders help these individuals interpret religious codes of conduct and
vindicate the legitimacy of their faith. Therefore, we expect respondents with intrinsic and extrinsic personal
motivations to be more likely to respond to the endorsement message relative to respondents with extrinsic
social motivations for religion (H52 ).
Finally, we expect individuals who self-report social identity, social capital and insurance based motivations for religion to have greater incentives to comply with social norms. Individuals with a social identity
motivation see compliance with social norms as signals of who belongs and who does not belong in the
group; individuals with social capital motivation value social interactions with co-religious adherents; and
4

individuals with an insurance motivation want to secure help in times of need. We also expect individuals
who self-report heuristics and morality based motivations to value the role of religious leaders in helping
them interpret religious codes of conduct (H53 ). We have no priors on the behavior of individuals who
self-report a tradition-based motivation.

Methods

The following section outlines a survey experiment in which a sample of Evangelical Christians in the United
States are randomly exposed to one of three conditions. In the placebo or control condition, respondents
will read a short vignette describing a few facts about covid-19 transmission. These facts are taken from
the CDC website. In the endorsement condition, this same set of facts will be presented with the addition of
a statement by Evangelical leader Franklin Graham endorsing mask-wearing. In the social norms condition,
the endorsement statement will be replaced by the statement that close to 80% of White Evangelicals have
worn a mask in public. It should be noted that all these statements are true, and that no deception is
involved in either of the treatment conditions. Our source for Pastor Graham’s statement is a 10 April 2020
interview with the Charlotte Observer. Our source for the statistic that 80% of White Evangelicals have
worn a mask in public comes from the magazine Christianity Today, which cites a covid-19 Tracking Poll
from Data for Progress.

2.1

Ethics Information

This study has received an exemption from the [REDACTED]. This design complies with all relevant
ethical and human subjects regulations. A written statement of informed consent will be obtained from
all participants in this study, and no personally identifying informations will be collected. Respondents
will not be incentivized for their participation.
In order to mitigate the possibility of unintended risks to the respondents, the experimental treatment
will only endorse public health behaviors that are widely accepted by the medical community to reduce the
spread of covid-19. Further, treatments will not employ any form of deception; all endorsements presented
to respondents will be factually accurate and framed in a manner consistent with the religious leader’s intent.

2.2

Design

To test the hypotheses outlined in Section 1, we conduct a brief online survey and endorsement experiment.
The 25 item questionnaire is designed to take no more than 15 minutes to complete.
The survey begins with a short battery of demographic questions to ascertain the respondent’s gender
identity, age, ideology, social and religious identities, religiosity, as well as the respondent’s beliefs pertaining
to covid-19 and information-seeking behavior. We then measure our three conditioning variables: religiosity,
the explicit / implicit scale of religious motivation, and our 6-point scale of religious motivation. Respondents

are then randomly assigned, with equal probability 13 , 13 , 31 , to treatment and control conditions. For each
vignette, we also ask respondents whether they already knew the information, and whether they believe
it. These questions are used to ensure respondents are actively paying attention to the treatment, and to
measure compliance with treatment.

5

We measure three outcomes. A thermometer question asks, on a scale of 1 to 10, how important the
respondent believes wearing a mask in public is for combatting the spread of covid-19. This is the outcome
measure we use for our power analysis. A second question asks the extent to which the respondent agrees
with a set of policies to mitigate the spread of covid-19. Finally, a behavioral measure asks respondents
how likely, on a scale of 1 to 10, they would add their name to a Change.org petition endorsing mask-wearing
in public. If respondents answer 5 or higher, they are then given the option to click on the petition URL,
which is a decision we can track.

2.3

Sampling plan

A sample of 1710 adults (aged 18+) will be collected by the online survey firm Lucid. We plan to enumerate
the survey among White Evangelical Christians in the United States. Eventually, we plan to extend this
sample to Evangelical Christians in Brazil. This design allows us to draw inferences on one of the least
compliant religious groups (Evangelicals) in their home countries.10
We estimate the sample size necessary to detect differences between three independent group means
at α = 0.05 and 80% power. We conservatively assume a small effect size, and thus estimate our sample
size using a Cohen’s f value of 0.075. Our analysis suggests that we are sufficiently powered to detect
relatively small average treatment effects with a sample size of n = 1692, equally apportioned between our
three comparison groups (ni = 564). Results of our analysis are shown in Figure 1; the vertical dashed line
2
indicates the minimum sample needed to achieve 80% power with σm
= 0.01 and σe2 = 1.75.

We also estimate the sample size needed to attain 80% power for our factorial interaction model (see
Equation 4) using a simulation-based approach. In particular, we assume β1 = 0.75, β2 = −0.1, and

 ∼ N (0, 1), and simulate the power to test the interaction term at β3 = {0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.125}, with

sample sizes ranging from 500 to 2250. Our results, shown in Figure 2, indicate that we have sufficient power
to detect an effect ≥ 0.075 with a sample size of at least 1500 respondents.

Main Effects

Our first two hypotheses suggest that respondents in the two treatment groups are significantly more likely
than those in the control group to comply with covid-19 prevention measures. We test these hypotheses
by first estimating the difference in treatment and control means for each of our three outcomes of interest
using a standard t-test and one-way ANOVA model. We then reestimate the treatment effect (ITT) more
formally using the following OLS model:
yi = α + βTi + γXi + i

(1)

Where yi is the outcome of interest for respondent i, β is the estimated treatment effect, Ti is the assignment
to treatment, Xi is a vector of demographic covariates, and i is the error term.
Because we also have a measure of treatment compliance (see Section 2.2), we plan to report the treatment
effect for compliers using an instrumental variable approach (Huang 2018). We first estimate:
Ci = α + δTi + i
10 See

this recent analysis by Ryan Burge using data collected by Data for Progress.

Where Ci is our compliance variable and Ti is assignment to treatment. δ gives the compliance rate; β from
Equation 1 divided by δ represents that compliance adjusted ITT (Sussman and Hayward 2010). The second
stage estimates:
yi = α + ζ Ĉi + γXi + i

Where Ĉi is the predicted compliance values generated by Equation 2, and ζ is the treatment effect for
compliant respondents.
2.4.2

Religiosity Mechanism

We test Hypothesis H4 using mediation analysis (Baron and Kenny 1986). Specifically, we estimate:
yi = α + β1 Ti + γXi + i

(4)

Mi = α + β2 Ti + γXi + i

(5)

yi = α + β3 Ti + β4 Mi + γXi + i

(6)

Where Ti is assignment to treatment, Mi is the mediator variable, and Xi is a vector of pre-treatment
covariates. Equation 4 is functionally equivalent to Equation 1 in Section 2.4.1. Equation 5 allows us to
test whether treatment affects the mediator; we expect β2 6= 0. Finally, Equation 6 tests the religiosity
mechanism. If β3 loses statistical significance with the inclusion of the mediation term (full mediation),

or if β3  β1 (partial mediation), it would suggest that a mediation effect exists and that religiosity is a
reasonable explanation of the effect of treatment on our outcome measures.

Additionally, we estimate the conditional average treatment effect using the following factorial interaction
model:
yi = α + β1 Ti + β2 Religiousi + β3 (Ti × Religiousi ) + γXi + i

(7)

Where T is the treatment condition and “Religious” is a measure of religiosity derived from Wilkes et
al. (1986). In Equation 4, β1 is the treatment effect at Religious = 0, β2 is the effect of religiosity on
our outcome of interest, and (β1 + β3 ) is the conditional average treatment effect. Since we hypothesize
that those respondents who self-report higher levels of religiosity are more likely to respond to both the
endorsement and ingroup norms treatments, we expect β3 > 0.
2.4.3

Religious Motivation Mechanism

Similar to our tests for the religiosity mechanism described in Section 2.4.2, we employ two strategies to test
Hypothesis H5 . We begin with mediation analysis to determine whether religious motivations might mediate
the effects of treatment. We estimate the following:
yi = α + β1 Ti + γXi + i

(8)

Mi = α + β2 Ti + γXi + i

(9)

yi = α + β3 Ti + β4 Mi + γXi + i

(10)

Equations 8, 9, and 10 are identical to Equations 4 through 6 above, though here Mi , our mediation variable,
is a set of variables that accounts for the three intrinsic and three extrinsic motivations in our six category
religious motivation taxonomy (see Section 1). Again, we expect β2 6= 0 and β3  β1 , as this would suggest

7

that a mediation effect exists and that religious motivations are a reasonable explanation for the effect of
treatment on our outcome measures.
Our second strategy estimates the following interaction model:
yi = α + β1 Ti + β2 Motivationi + β3 (Ti × Motivationi ) + γXi + i

(11)

Where “Motivation” is a binary indicator of the respondent’s first choice ranking of statements 1 through
6 in Section 1 above, and β3 is the interaction term. We would interpret a positive and significant β3 as
evidence of the religious motivation mechanism.
