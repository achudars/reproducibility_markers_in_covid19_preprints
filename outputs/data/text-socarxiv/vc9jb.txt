"17" "Abstract"
"18" "Background:  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a significant burden of mortality and morbidity. A vaccine will be the most effective global preventive strategy to end the pandemic. Studies have maintained that exposure to negative sentiments related to vaccination on social media increases vaccine hesitancy and refusal.  Despite the influence social media has on vaccination behavior, there is a lack of studies exploring the public's exposure to misinformation, conspiracy theories, and concerns on Twitter regarding a potential COVID-19 vaccination. The study aims to identify the major thematic areas about a potential COVID-19 vaccination based on Twitter data contents.   "
"19" "Methods:  We retrieved 1,286,659 publicly available tweets posted within the timeline of July 19, 2020, to August 19, 2020, leveraging the Twint package. Following the extraction, we used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling and identified 20 topics discussed in the tweets. We selected 4,868 tweets with the highest probability of belonging in the specific cluster and manually labeled them as positive, negative, neutral, or irrelevant.  The negative tweets were further assigned to a theme and subtheme based on the content."
"20" "Results:  1306 out of 4868 tweets were categorized as negative, and the emerging themes: misinformation (32.47%), vaccine safety and effectiveness (21.13%), conspiracy theories (17.99%), and mistrust of scientists and governments (12.86%), lack of intent to get a COVID-19 vaccine (10.64%), freedom of choice (3.60%), and religious beliefs (1.30%).  Negative tweets predominantly consisted of misleading statements  such as  immunization against coronavirus is unnecessary as the survival rate is  high, and  concerns about the side effects of a potential vaccine being developed at an unprecedented speed. "
"21" "Conclusion:  Our findings suggest a need to formulate a large-scale vaccine communication plan that will address the safety concerns and debunk the misinformation and conspiracy theories spreading across social media platforms ."
"22" "Introduction"
"23" "COVID-19, an acute respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [1]. The pandemic has caused a significant burden with over 69 million infections and an estimated 1.5 million deaths worldwide as of 10 December 2020 [2].  Globally, countries responded to the crisis by implementing risk mitigation strategies to contain the spread of the virus, which included social distancing and mobility restrictions [3]. However, these measures have led to catastrophic consequences to the global economy and healthcare systems and have also adversely affected the population ' s physical, social, and psychological health. Therefore, a vaccine will be the most effective global preventive strategy for limiting the spread of the virus [4,5].  COVID-19 vaccine coverage of  ~67% is estimated to be sufficient to achieve herd immunity based on the assumption that the basic reproductive number ( R 0) of the virus is three [6,7]."
"24" "Evidence suggests that vaccines have been effective in preventing infectious diseases [8].    The effectiveness of vaccines depends on people ' s immunization uptake; however, the availability of vaccines does not always translate into utilization [9]. This is because there has been a decline in vaccine confidence that has resulted in vaccination hesitancy and refusal, which has further contributed to the global decline in vaccination uptake and has caused infectious disease outbreaks worldwide [9,10,11].  Therefore, vaccine hesitancy or refusal poses serious global health risks. Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has included vaccine hesitancy in its top 10 global health threats for 2019 [12]."
"25" "A key factor in low vaccine confidence is exposure to misinformation and falsehoods [13].   Misinformation and negative sentiments are highly contagious and can potentially reduce vaccine uptake rates [14]. An example is the spread of mistrust, and unsubstantiated theories on vaccine safety against the 2009 swine flu outbreak had a significant negative impact on people ' s willingness to be vaccinated [15]."
"26" "Multiple potential COVID-19 vaccine candidates show  promising phase 3 clinical trial results, and several COVID-19 vaccines have received  emergency  authorization for us e in particular countries, including the United States  [ 16,17].   However, people ' s willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine to stop the community spread of COVID-19 is currently insufficient in several countries, including the US, several countries from Africa, Europe, and Asia [18,19].  Globally, vaccine confidence is low, with 52% of adults stating their willingness to get vaccinated within less than three months after the COVID-19 vaccine becomes available to all [20].  The low  confidence will then act as a barrier to achieving herd immunity, which is essential to end the pandemic."
"27" "Therefore, there is a critical need to gain a deeper understanding of people ' s perceptions of a potential COVID-19 vaccine. Furthermore, to enhance vaccine confidence among the population, it is essential to develop and implement strategies to mitigate the concerns and combat the misinformation and rumors related to the safety and effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine."
"28" "Traditional methods such as surveys, which are extremely expensive and time-consuming, cannot capture real-time perceptions and are subject to a social desirability bias [21]. A prompt understanding of the people ' s concerns in real-time can be obtained from social media [22]."
"29" "Social media provides real-time content on people ' s knowledge and opinions on several issues, including population-level health and behavior [23].   Twitter, a popular social media platform, can be a reliable source for assessing the public ' s knowledge, personal experiences and identifying health information needs [24]. Analyzing Twitter data thereby provides a snapshot of health knowledge and informs targeted health information communication [24]. Its interactive nature can also be used as an effective educational tool for health-related interventions [24]."
"30" "Social media is frequently used to disseminate vaccine-related information; however, it has also provided easy access to incorrect information and misinformed opinions along with denial of scientific studies, which have left concerned families susceptible to strongly voiced misleading opinions in the media [25]. Misinformation and rumors about the current pandemic have also been rapidly propagating on social media platforms, including Twitter, and negatively influenced COVID-19 related health behavior [26]."
"31" "Additionally, there are many anti-vaccine advocates in social media, particularly on Twitter, where anti-vaccine beliefs comprise a substantial amount of vaccination-related tweets [27]. Several studies have maintained that exposure to negative sentiments, misinformation, and rumors about vaccination on Twitter has increased vaccine hesitancy and refusal and a decline in vaccination uptake [27,28,29]."
"32" "Given the influence and wide-reaching capabilities of Twitter, we will be conducting a content analysis  of tweets  to gain a fuller understanding of the perception people have of a COVID-19 vaccination.  The aim of the study is to determine the public ' s sentiment towards  the   immunization  and  to  identify the major thematic areas of safety concerns, misinformation, and rumors  related to the vaccine  on Twitte r.  To the best of our knowledge , this is the first study to use Twitter data   to understand  people ' s  opinion  of  a potential  vaccination  against coronavirus .  The new knowledge gained from this study is essential to effectively comb at the spread of misinformation,  to designing policy strategies to gain public trust, and increasing the rate of  COVID-19  immunization  uptake to control the pandemic globally, once one or more COVID-19 vaccines become available to the public."
"33" "Method:"
"34" "Search Strategy and Data Collection"
"35" "We retrieved data using the Twint package, a publicly available, advanced Twitter scraping tool written in python [30].  W e  r etrieved 1,286,659 tweets posted within the timeline of July 19, 2020, to August 19, 2020, and contained the keywords:  \" vaccine \"  or  \" #vaccine \"  in it. This period overlapped with announcements of 3 potential COVID-19 vaccines progressing into phase 3 trial and the approval of a Russian vaccine, Sputnik V [16]. This study was approved by the Texas A&M University Institutional Review Board  on December 2020  (IRB 2020-1417)."
"36" "As the tweets can contain emojis and newlines, we converted tweets to the lemmatized format to process them using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm [31]. First, we removed all the URLs from the tweet texts. We then converted the tweet text to lowercase, removing leading and trailing whitespaces, tokenizing and removing the accents from the tweet texts."
"37" "After the texts were cleaned by the simple preprocessor, we lemmatized the texts. The lemmatization process converts the word to its basic form based on the context. For example - if we lemmatize  \" vaccines \"  it would return the form  \" vaccine. \"  When the lemmatization process was compl eted, we removed the stop words such as,   \" the, such, as, etc., \"   from the remaining tweet texts."
"38" "To create the model, we needed to develop the corpora by taking all the unique lemmatized words from the text and forming the bag of words. By removing the usernames, we de-identified the tweets. Our dataset included tweets in English Language only."
"39" "Topic Modelling Technique"
"40" "Following data extraction, we employed Topic Modelling to screen tweets for inclusion and to identify the common topics, excluding any posts that are not relevant. Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique for identifying clusters based on the co-occurrence of words and has been previously used in studies related to vaccination and social media  [31,32]. We used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a topic modeling algorithm, to determine the relevant tweets compared to the irrelevant tweets containing COVID-19 vaccination keywords [31].   To determine this number of clusters, we ran a sensitivity test with multiple values for a number of clusters but got a saturated coherence score near 20 topics."
"41" "After the LDA returns the clusters, we assigned each tweet to a corresponding  topic .  From each of the 20  topics , w e selected  the  first  20 tweets with the highest probability of belonging in the specific  topic   for the initial coding process."
"42" "Coding Strategy"
"43" "Codes were adapted from analyses of Twitter contents and themes previously identified in the literature   [21,32,33] . We refined these codes through an inductive approach that involved manually evaluating  the  top 20 twe ets from each of the 20 topics  to supplement the codebook we had created based on the previous literature.   A final codebook presented the definition of the sentiment  categories,  the themes  and sub-themes  for the negative contents."
"44" "Then  we selected 5000  tweets   from our original dataset to conduct content analysis. Previous research has shown that qualitative content analysis can be done using less than a thousand tweets [34]. However, we used a larger set of tweets to ensure optimal representation of the public ' s perspectives on social media. After extracting these tweets, duplicate entries were discarded, and 4,868 tweets were labeled by 3 coders (R K S, MR and NF T ). The coders first manually assigned sentiments of the content to identify if the tweet was positive, negative, neutral, or irrelevant. The negative tweets were then assigned to a theme and subtheme based on the content. 10% of tweets were randomly selected and split between two additional researchers (TN,ST) to check the accuracy of this annotation,. Coder agreement was confirmed by determining inter-rater reliability (Cohen's kappa score was 0.80)."

"75" "Results"
"76" "Content analysis: classifying tweets into categories"
"77" "1306 out of 4868 tweets were categorized as negative, out of which the majority (32.47%) tweets were classified as misinformation, followed by tweets expressing concern regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness (21.13%), tweets related to conspiracy theories on potential COVID-19 vaccines (17.99%), and mistrust of scientists and governments (12.86%). Additionally, 10.64 % of tweets expressed a lack of willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine when it became available,  and a  future mandatory COVID-19 vaccine program was perceived as a limitation to freedom of choice in 3.60 % of tweets. Lastly, 1.30% of tweets expressed concerns or restrictions regarding a potential COVID-19 immunization due to religious beliefs."

"139" "(n =17, 100%)"
"140" "Tweets expressing religious concerns  about  the ingredients  used in developing the vaccine or about the vaccines in general."
"141" "Misinformation :"
"142" "The predominant theme to emerge was  \" Misinformation \"  (32.47%, n =424). This theme encompassed tweets making misleading statements that were not substantiated by evidence. Some of the  contents of the  tweets  under this theme  are as follows: herd immunity was safer than getting a vaccination to protect against the coronavirus, v accines are medical experiments, vaccines are  not  part of  real science, COVID-19 vaccine will not work on people with obesity,  the vaccine  will be  only for the elderly population , vaccin es don ' t exist for any viruses , and lastly, vaccines are not adequately tested. Some tweets have also expressed concern about the process of testing vaccine safety in countries that have low coronavirus infection rates such as,  \" How could a country reporting so few cases actually be able to test a v accine for safety and efficacy? \" ."
"143" "The majority of the tweets belonging to this theme were classified under the sub-theme of  \" Vaccine is unnecessary \"  (65.57%, n =278). In this sub-theme, tweets expressed various unsupported information and claimed that the vaccine for COVID-19 is not necessary for protection from coronavirus infection. For example,"
"144" "\"Why do we need a vacci ne for a disease that has a 99.9 % survival rate?\""
"145" "\"I already have a vaccine called a human immune system.\""
"146" "\"Herd immunity is safer than a vaccine.\""
"147" "The next sub-theme was classified as  \" falsehood, \"  with 19.10% (n =81) of the tweets making false claims about vaccination.  For example,"
"148" "\"VACCINES ARE AN ILLUSION ... There will never be a functional vaccine\, and  there never was a functional vaccine.\""
"149" "\"The vaccines don't work as well on obese people... A lot of you are obese.\""
"150" "\"Vaccines are not double blind tested with inert placebo and there aren ' t any longitudinal safety studies.\""
"151" "Out of the total tweets under the theme misinformation,  10.38% (n=44) of the tweets were categorized as  \" vaccines are untested \" . This group of tweets questioned the credibility of the vaccine developed within such a short time and claimed that untested vaccines would be made available for the general public."
"152" "\"Is any vaccine safe to use when it was only tested for like 2 months?\""
"153" "\"Can't see how they would have a thoroughly tested vaccine by then? (And that really works). Promises, promises!\""
"154" "\"I will not use the new vaccine, I will wait until it has been really tested.\""
"155" "The last sub-theme was  \" Vaccine causes autism and other unknown illnesses \"  (4.95%, n =21). These tweets held vaccines responsible for autism in children and claimed that vaccines cause diseases."
"156" "\"What about PTSD? Could it also be due to vaccines?\""
"157" "\"Vaccines will cause autism by 2032. 50% of all children will have autism.\""
"158" "\"Vaccination causes autism and other disabilities in children. \""
"159" "Safety and effectiveness:"
"160" "The second common theme was  \" Safety and effectiveness, \"  comprising 21.13% (n =276) of all tweets that expressed negative sentiment. This category of tweets expressed perceived concerns regarding the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine developed at a rushed speed, with some users posting tweets where they stated that they would prefer being exposed to the coronavirus than get the vaccine. One such tweet was,  \" I'll take my chances with covid-19. I'm not going to  take some rushed vaccine.\""
"161" "Among the tweets discussing the vaccine ' s safety and effectiveness, tweets expressing concern about the potential adverse side effects of the  potential covid-19  vaccine were found to be widespread (50.72%, n =140).  For example,"
"162" "\"A COVID vaccine may very well be the next REAL pandemic.\""
"163" "\" Covid vaccine will kill 50 million American s \" ."
"164" "\"What happens when the death rate from the Vaccine is worse than the death rate from the Virus? I fully expect that to be the case.\""
"165" "Next emerging sub theme was regarding the  \" vaccine will be ineffective \" . It comprised 36.96% (n=102) tweets among the 276 tweets under the theme  \" safety and effectiveness \" . Majority of the tweets in this category claimed that the vaccine will not be potent enough to protect against covid-19 infections."
"166" "\"The body does not sustain antibodies to COVID. How can there be a vaccine?\""
"167" "\"How can vaccines work if the virus is changing day by day! The vaccine may not work! I believe prevention is better than vaccines and Chlorite is better than that!\""
"168" "\"There is no proven immunity to this virus. Medical Professionals have found that antibodies disappeared after infection and stated that there is no guarantee that an effective vaccine will be found.\""
"169" "Tweets within the sub-theme of  \" Fast-paced vaccine development \"  (12.32%, n =34) highlighted the rapid production of the vaccine and expressed concern regarding the safety and efficacy of a rushed vaccine."
"170" "\"I think most people would trust a vaccine but a rushed though vaccine is another matter.\""
"171" "\"Because the vaccine development is so accelerated, we will not have all the safety data to risk exposure of vulnerable populations to vaccines. \""
"172" "\"Also, who wants a warp speed vaccine? Not me!\""
"173" "Conspiracy theories:"
"174" "The third theme that emerged was \"Conspiracy theories,\"  (19%,  n =248) and covered a wide range of unconventional and unfounded theories regarding the potential covid-19 vaccine."
"175" "Nearly half of the tweets (48.9%, n =121) were categorized  under the sub- theme   \"Profit for big corporations , \" and consisted of tweets that stated how the big corporations or pharmacological companies and health care services would make enormous revenue from the production and distribution of the vaccine. Some of the tweets also allege d  that Bill Gates and Dr. Anthony Fauci will be making a financial profit from potential COVID-19 vaccines"
"176" "\"The same doctors are telling you it works. Fauci and Gates don't want anything that jeopardizes the money to be made from vaccines. You people must wake up.\""
"177" "\"No money to be made from HCQ. Millions to be made from the ineffective vaccine.\""
"178" "\"Big Pharma wants the vaccine, it will make some company a lot of money.\""
"179" "The remaining half of the tweets (51.21%, n =127) have stated various unusual theories  and  are  summarized in Table 3."

"251" "Discussion"
"252" "The findings of the current research highlight the plethora of misinformation and conspiracy theories surrounding a potential COVID-19 vaccination spread through popular social media platform -Twitter. Our study undertook a qualitative content analysis of Twitter posts to better understand the public's perceptions of and exposure to information on a potential immunization against coronavirus. We classified tweets into different sentiment categories and analyzed posts expressing negative sentiments towards a potential coronavirus vaccine. Through the analysis, we identified seven major themes: \"safety and effectiveness,\" \"misinformation,\" \"conspiracy theories,\" \"mistrust of scientists and governments,\" \"lack of intent to get a COVID-19 vaccine,\" \"freedom of choice,\" and \"religious beliefs.\"  Negative tweets predominantly consisted of misleading statements that immunization against coronavirus is not necessary as the likelihood that a COVID-19 infection will result in death is low. The second most common tweets expressed concern regarding the side effects of a potential vaccine being developed at an unprecedented speed. Our results also show that a significant number of tweets spread conspiracy theories regarding the ingredients used in developing vaccines, while others alleged that large pharmaceutical companies had primarily financial rather than health-related motives for developing vaccines. We have also found tweets that showed mistrust towards science and scientists, particularly Dr. Anthony Fauci along with vaccine advocates such as Bill Gates, who is allegedly involved in developing COVID-19 vaccines with a microchip to promote the establishment of a global surveillance network. Our findings are consistent with recent studies that have focused on understanding the public's willingness to get immunized against coronavirus once a vaccine becomes available [18,19,20,36]. This suggests a need to formulate a large-scale vaccine communication plan which will address the safety concerns and debunk the misinformation and conspiracy theories spreading across social media platforms to increase the public's acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccination."
"253" "Vaccine-related trust is a global health concern. In recent years, many countries reported having new cases of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, mumps, and rubella, which can be attributable to many psychosocial factors, including a lack of trust in vaccines in many contexts [37]. Often a low number of such cases for several decades might have resulted in a public perception that those vaccines are no longer useful. In this way, the success of vaccination programs might have affected the credibility of those programs in a paradoxical manner, which must be addressed for preventing infectious diseases and associated population health burden."
"254" "Despite a lack of credible evidence, some people may suggest that vaccines may cause certain illnesses or adverse biological consequences, leading to anti-vaccine movements that have gained momentum in different populations [38]. Such misinformation, often coupled with a general distrust of science, has been accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this way, a critical and persistent public health issue such as vaccine distrust is likely to affect the ongoing efforts by the research community, vaccine manufacturers, and regulatory agencies who are working together to ensure the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. The ongoing scientific developments should be widely communicated to restore the public's trust in vaccines and vaccination programs and engage the general public, wh ich  may prevent such misconceptions [39]."
"255" "Vaccine related conspiracy theories may gain traction when different opinion leaders spread them. For instance, in 1990, a conspiracy theory was spread that a tetanus vaccine was used in Cameroon to sterilize girls and women [40]. As a result, vaccination rates against tetanus declined to as low as 13% in the following five years. Another conspiracy theory related to vaccination in Nigeria during 2003 suggested an oral polio vaccine (OPV) was an American plot to sterilize Muslim girls and spread the human immunodeficiency virus [41]."
"256" "Such conspiracy theories and misleading statements resulted in the suspension of OPV use in five northern Nigerian states. The impacts of such conspiracy theories were enormous.  Between 2002 and 2006, wild poliovirus cases in the country increased fivefold. In both cases, the conspiracy theories were endorsed by local opinion leaders that appeared to have some credibility to the general public, who might not have had access to accurate information."
"257" "Similar studies from Pakistan suggest that those parents who had refused OPV during annual OPV campaigns attributed their refusal commonly to the perception that the vaccine was associated with fertility and disapproval of the religious leaders in their communities [42]. In low-income contexts where institutions are not optimally functioning, and local opinion leaders shape the public perceptions and practices, vaccine hesitancy may have unique psychosocial correlates that should be examined in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic."
"258" "Vaccine hesitancy can also be associated with a lack of trust in conventional medicine and health systems. A study among 5200 Spanish participants found that distrust in conventional medicine was associated with vaccine hesitancy, markedly higher in people who used complementary and alternative medicine [43]. This may offer valuable insights into people's health behavior who do not trust conventional medications or vaccines but have some trust in alternative therapies. In countries such as India and China, where alternative medicine is widely used, [44] public health authorities may partner with those providers to empower the populations with scientifically accurate information and deliver vaccines, thereby establishing trust in public health measures. Local healthcare providers, both formal and informal, should be engaged in community-based participatory planning for the communities' health goals and how they can collaborate and serve respective populations addressing the local concerns and challenges. Future research is needed to better understand such local issues that are likely to be unique in different contexts and people. Perhaps, such knowledge would complement the findings of the current study and enable the researchers to understand how different  psychosocial factors interact across populations and result in a varying range of concerns related to vaccines and vaccination programs."
"259" "Effective health communication would be necessary for addressing complex issues such as vaccine hesitancy during and after this pandemic. A robust public health framework involving regulatory authorities and well-established activities may promote health during public health emergencies. It is necessary to strengthen such measures globally and allow institutions to exchange their expertise to encourage scientific rigor of authorizing vaccines."
"260" "Limitations"
"261" "Firstly, we limited our sample size due to the labor-intensive nature of manual coding therefore our finding may not represent all the topics discussed on Twitter relevant to COVID-19 vaccination. Secondly, due to the rapid changes in information related to COVID-19 vaccine, the categorization of the tweets may be subject to bias. We removed URLs and excluded videos and images of tweets without considering the information it contained. Finally, our search timeframe was limited and therefore might not capture the recent topics discussed on social media. Thus, there is a need for future research to continue monitoring the public's opinion as the COVID-19 vaccines become available in order to monitor the misinformation being shared on the social media platforms and enhance our understanding of vaccination hesitancy surrounding a COVID-19 immunization."
"262" "Conclusion:"
"263" "Anti-vaccine movements have always been vocal online [25], and the COVID-19  \" infodemic \"  has significantly compromised the prevention efforts [26]. If the current misinformation surge across the web is not nipped in the bud, the vaccination movement will likely suffer, endangering public safety. Public health organizations should recognize this imminent threat and launch health education programs using traditional and social media platforms to immunize the public against misinformation. Health care professionals must learn to adapt to the evolving scientific evidence and relevant misinformation and safety concerns associated with the vaccine to allay the fears and aversions regarding this rapidly developed  immunization."
"264" "A global collaboration may enable the public health authorities to address common concerns raised by communities and population groups globally. As Twitter and other social media continue to evolve, the efforts to communicate effective health information should be based on scientific statements that have global consensus among the researchers, regulatory authorities, and other key stakeholders. Media partnerships should be strengthened to control inaccurate and hazardous media contents and to disseminate credible information targeted to promote uptake of a potential covid-19 vaccine to end the pandemic."
