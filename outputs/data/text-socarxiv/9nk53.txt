Using time use diaries to track changing behavior across successive stages of
COVID-19 social restrictions
Abstract
We present analyses of 24-hour time use diary records of the UK population’s activities, their social
context and their location, collected in real time from four successive waves of representative UK
samples, both before, and during, the current COVID-19 pandemic. We show changes in behavioral
response to social restrictions at three time-points during the pandemic, including across two
nationwide lockdowns. Comparing samples across the four waves, we find evidence of substantial
changes in the population’s activities, locations and social interactions, which may be interpreted as
direct responses to changes in regulations. One of our main motivations was to compare risk-related
behavior across the first and second lockdowns. We find suggestive evidence that the second
lockdown (recorded late November 2020) was less strictly adhered to than the first (recorded MayJune 2020). Holding constant gender, age and social grade, the population spent on average 32
more minutes per day in high risk activities in late November 2020 than in first lockdown.
Disaggregating by gender and age group, the difference was found to be statistically significant for
all groups, with the exception of those aged 55 and over.

Significance statement
What do people do during lockdown? This set of data is unique in providing time use diary
information in real time on changing behavior in the UK in response to each major change in social
restrictions. This enables us to directly compare 24-hour continuous and comprehensive
information on the populations’ activities, their social context and their location, comparing riskrelated behavior during different phases of social restrictions. Holding constant gender, age and
social grade, we show that the UK population spent on average 32 more minutes per day in high risk
activities in the second UK lockdown in November 2020 than in first lockdown (starting March 2020).
This difference was statistically significant.

Introduction
What do people actually do in response to restrictions on their activities and social contacts imposed
over the course of the pandemic? Epidemiological surveys of behaviour during the pandemic have
focused on tracing social contacts in order to determine risk [1,2,3,4], while social science surveys
have focused on asking respondents to estimate the quantity of time they spent in certain activities
at particular times [5]. Yet neither of these sources provides a complete record of daily behavior. In
this article we present analyses of 24-hour time use diary records of the UK populations’ activities,
their social context and their location, collected in real time from four successive waves of
representative UK samples, both before, and at three points during, the current pandemic. At a time
when capacity is still limited both in respect both of immunization and track-trace technology,
governments must continue to rely on changes in people’s daily behaviors to contain the spread of
the COVID-19 virus. Time use diary information of this type, collected in real time across the course
of the pandemic, will provide policy-makers with information to assess and quantify changes in daily
behaviors following the imposition of social restrictions, and the impact they are likely to have on
overall behavioral-associated risks.
As far as we are aware this ongoing data collection is unique in providing information on changing
behavior in response to each major change in social restrictions. Comparing samples across these
four waves, we find evidence of substantial changes in the UK population’s activities, locations and
social interactions, which are interpretable as direct responses to social regulations. One of our main
motivations was to compare behavior across successive lockdowns. We find suggestive evidence
that the second lockdown (November 2020) may have been less strictly adhered to than the first
(starting March 2020).
Complete spatio-temporal accounts of the activities (including their location and social context) and
socio-demographic characteristics of representative samples are key to understanding populations’
changing behavioral risks of infection [6]. It is clear from the epidemiological literature that
infection follows social proximity, in physical and temporal terms, to infected individuals. Time use
3

diary information offers the potential to identify levels of risk associated with daily behavior through
attribution of levels of infection risk to certain combinations of activity, location and social context,
and to compare these between population subgroups, such as by age and gender. When time use
diary-derived patterns of daily behavior are linked to infection risk in this way, it enables the
identification of those changes in behavior which are likely to contribute to subsequent changes in
infection rates. It appears that the short second (November 2020) lockdown had, overall, a smaller
effect on the prevalence of high-risk daily behavior (such as doing paid work in the workplace) than
did the first, starting in March 2020. We disaggregate these changes to examine potential
differentials by two characteristics known to be associated with the risk of infection; gender and age
[7,8].

The measurement of daily behavior: alternative approaches
There are various approaches to measuring what people do through the day:
(a) Human observation; a labor intensive, and hence costly, technique, with dangers of
contamination associated with the presence of the observer (e.g. from social desirability effects
and privacy concerns).
(b) Mobile devices recording individuals’ activities continuously (e.g. worn body cameras,
accelerometers) provide the highest level of accuracy, but involve heavy costs related to the
interpretation of real-time records.
(c) Survey questions about activities or behavior (e.g. “how often/how many times per day/week
did you ….?”, and “how long do you spend…?”) are subject to problems of accuracy relating to
recall, self-representation (desirability bias), and generalization (as the same activity
undertaken at different times of the day or week may have varying durations, so that some
attempt at ‘averaging’ is required of the respondent).
(d) Continuous diary accounts recording successive activities are regarded as superior to survey
questions because they reduce recall issues (being generally recorded on the diary day), deter
misrepresentation (since activities merely over- or under-represented in response to survey

4

questions must be replaced by a complicated construction of entries in continuous diary
records); and enhance generalizability (as different durations of the same activity through the
day or week may be recorded). Time use diary data has been validated through small-scale
comparisons with more expensive approaches using objective instruments (cameras, motion
sensors) worn through the diary observation period [9].
Time use diaries have been used before in the context of investigating behavior related to COVID-19
[10,11,12], but not to report changing behavioral-related infection risks at successive surveys
reflecting periods of changing social restrictions (the UK Office of National Statistics collected a pilot
online time-use diary only once during the pandemic, in March-April 2020 [13]), and did not use it
for combining multiple diary fields to estimate behavior-related infection risks.
Data
The data collection instrument is a low-respondent-burden (12-15 minutes per day), low-cost, online
diary (the Click and Drag Diary Instrument, CaDDI), developed by the Centre for Time Use Research,
and suitable for rapid deployment in real time in situations such as the current pandemic [14]. The
CaDDI diaries collect information on six characteristics (or ‘diary fields’): ‘main’ and ‘other
simultaneous’ activities; location; co-presence; ICT device use; and enjoyment, for each successive
episode throughout the 24-hour day (where episodes are defined as periods through which all diary
fields remain unchanged).
Four nationally-representative (quota-based) samples of UK CaDDI data are to date available for
analysis. They were collected in 2016 May and October (to reduce single-season effects); late
May/early June 2020 (first lockdown); mid August 2020 (intermediate period of restrictions
following the end of first lockdown); and late November 2020 (second lockdown). Diary
respondents were members of the large Dynata agency market research panel, who volunteered for
the survey and were selected on the basis of age, sex, social grade and region quotas representative
of the 2016 national population. Each respondent completed diaries for between 1 and 3 days,
yielding a total of 4360 days from 2202 individuals. The four waves were collected, respectively, in:

5

May and October of 2016 (representing pre-pandemic behavior patterns, N=1011 diary days); MayJune 2020 (during the first UK lockdown, N=1007); August 2020 (during the post-lockdown summer
relaxation of restrictions, N=987); and November 2020 (the second lockdown, N=1358). Weights
were calculated both to yield the correct numbers of days-of-the-week for each sex and (10-year)
age group in the UK population, and to correct for an under-representation (of about 16%) in the
2020 diary samples in the 65+ age group. All analyses in this article were conducted using these
weights.

Methods
We assign the level of risk for each diary episode by combining three of the simultaneous diary
fields: activity type, location and co-presence. These assignments are made taking cognizance of the
literature on COVID-19 infection transmission, which considers time at home alone or with members
of the same household as lowest-risk, with the main focus for transmission being contact with nonhousehold members, both at or away from home. The virus is more likely to be transmitted indoors,
in crowds, and through personal contact of over 15 minutes [15,16]. Table 1 shows assignments for
each combination of the three diary fields to one of five risk categories, ranging from lowest (1) to
highest risk level (5). Activities are shown down the first column, and assigned a risk category
according to copresence information (alone or with other household members/with non-household
members), nested within location (at home/away from home). Estimates of risk for location and copresence status vary according to the activity (e.g. cinema implies the presence of other, nonhousehold, individuals), and are influenced by its characteristic location (e.g. indoors enclosed, vs
open-air). Co-presence information may be supplemented from the activity fields, so ‘using public
transport’ can be taken to imply current or recent presence of other, non-household, individuals.
We assigned activities lasting only one 10-minute timeslot to the lowest risk level (level 1) [16]. For
further details on these assignments and their rationale see Gershuny et al 2020 [6].

We used multivariate OLS regression models to investigate the statistical significance of differences
in the time spent in different risk categories across the waves of the data. For this purpose we
divided risk categories into three groups: low risk (category 1 in Table 1 above); medium risk
(categories 2-4) and high risk (category 5). In these models the dependent variable is the time spent
at each wave in each of the three risk groups, and the independent variables were survey wave,
gender, age group and social grade. To estimate statistical significance we used robust clustered
standard errors estimated from single-respondent cross-day clusters (stata vs 16), to take account of
the varying number of diaries per respondent.

Findings
Reduction in effectiveness of lockdown regulations on daily behavior.
Figure 1 summarizes the ‘average day’ (1440 minutes) for the four tranches of data as mean daily
durations (minutes per day) in nine combinations of activity, location, and co-presence, grouped
according to the risk categories provided in Table 1. Changes across the four columns of Figure 1
indicate larger changes in the UK population’s time allocation across the successive phases of the
COVID-19 epidemic than were observed in the UK over the fifteen-year period 2000-2015 [17]. The
initial lockdown period (collected in May-June 2020) was associated with a substantial shift of time
away from the high risk behaviors characterizing pre-pandemic behavior (in particular, paid work in
the workplace and out of home leisure) towards home-based activities involving lower levels of
contact with non-household members (and hence lower risk of infection). Partial relaxation of the
lockdown regulations in August 2020 produced the expected partial return to previous patterns of
daily activity. Finally, the subsequent re-imposition of lockdown regulations during November 2020
produced, as we show below, only a partial return the patterns of behavior observed during the first
lockdown.
***********Figure 1 about here*******************
7

Are these changes statistically significant? Table 2 shows results from an OLS regression model with
robust clustered standard. Three models are shown in the columns of the table, each with time
(minutes/day) spent in the respective risk level (risk levels 1; 2-4; 5) as the dependent variable. The
models include dummy variables for survey wave, sex, age group and social grade. The results
provide support for the straightforward reading of Figure 1. The substantial reduction of time per
day in high-risk, and increase in time in low-risk, activities associated with the movement into the
initial lockdown (May-June 2020 - the reference category) are both clearly statistically significant.
Firstly, the models for high and low risk activities both account for 10-11% of the explained variance
(R2), while the model for medium risk activities explains less variance (2%). Describing the regression
coefficients, holding other variables constant, across the population an average of 185 more minutes
per day were spent in high risk activities and 238 less minutes in low risk activities prior to the
pandemic (P<.001). The reverse movements out of first lock-down to intermediate levels of highand low-risk behavior between June and August 2020 are again strongly statistically significant,
though they do not return to previous levels of riskiness. During this intermediate period there was
an average of 62 more minutes per day spent in high risk activities and 88 minutes less in low risk
activities (P<.001). Of particular note is that the return to lockdown in November 2020 elicited
significantly less risk-avoidant behavior than that associated with the first lockdown. 32 more
minutes were spent in high risk activities (P<.005), and 31 minutes less in low risk activities (P<.05)
compared to first lockdown. This may be to some degree associated with differences in the detail of
the official regulations. But we cannot ignore the possible interpretation that it also reflects a
decline in the UK population’s willingness to comply with government regulations.
**********Table 2 about here ****************

Disaggregation of response to changing regulations by activity/co-presence/location categories
Table 3 provides more detail on the changes in the detail of behavior that are associated with these
changes in risk levels, again expressed as contrasts with behavior during the first lockdown. Nine

8

models are shown across the rows of the table, each showing coefficients for the minutes/day spent
in each activity/co-presence/location combination shown in Figure 1. Each model includes the same
list of independent variables as the models shown for Table 2 (see Supplementary Table S1 for the
full set of coefficients from the regression models for each activity category). The first four rows of
the table show the much lower levels of low risk activity categories done at home pre-COVID in 2016
(including personal care, unpaid work, home leisure, and paid work). Correspondingly, much more
time was spent away from home with people from outside the household (in paid work, education,
out-of-home leisure or caring), or in enclosed areas (e.g. cafes or cinemas). Almost all these activity
categories were statistically significantly different from the time spent in these activities at first
lockdown (May-June 2020), which saw reductions of over one hour per day in out-of-home leisure
with non-household members, and nearly two hours’ reduction in paid work or study away from
home.
**********Table 3 about here*********************
The intermediate period (relaxation of restrictions, August 2020) produced reversals in these
behavior patterns, again, in most cases highly statistically significant, but around half the size of the
pre-pandemic to first lockdown changes. In particular, less time was again spent in activities done at
home, with the exception of paid work at home, which, interestingly, remained unchanged from its
first lockdown level – a lack of change that persisted into the second lockdown. At the other end of
the scale, the higher-risk return to the workplace during this period, though highly statistically
significant, is only one quarter of the size of the previous shift of paid work from the workplace to
the home during first lockdown (half an hour more, compared to nearly 2 hours). And as the
analyses of Table 2 have shown, the shift back into second lockdown involves a relatively smallerscale return to more risk-avoidant behavior. The second lockdown was characterized by lesser
amounts of time spent at home than during first lockdown (by an average of 15-30 minutes per day
in unpaid work, leisure and personal care activities done at home), through the relaxation of
restrictions and into second lockdown. The exception is paid work at home, which again remained
unchanged from the time of first lockdown. There is also an indication of some increase in high-risk,
9

out of home, activities (paid work in the workplace, up 33 minutes, and leisure away from home, up
12 minutes) compared to the first lockdown, but these differences are on the margin of statistical
significance.

Disaggregation of response to changing regulations by gender and age
Figure 2 disaggregates behavioral change across the pandemic by age and gender, two factors which
have previously been shown to be related to important differences in risk of infection [7,8]. The
graphs display regression coefficients for time spent (minutes per day) in the 3 broad risk categories
(high, medium and low) outlined in Table 1, expressed as contrasts to the UK first lockdown in MayJune 2020. They are based on separate regression models for the two genders and three age groups
(sample sizes were unfortunately not sufficiently large to permit modelling age within gender). The
same combination of dependent and independent variables is used as in the regression models for
Table 2 (although omitting the gender variable in the analyses disaggregated by gender, and the age
group variable in the analyses disaggregated by age group). Full regression coefficients are provided
in Supplementary Tables S2 (by gender) and S3 (by age group).
*************Figure 2 about here*******************
The first thing to note is that the pattern of the coefficients across the stages of social restrictions for
most gender and age groups broadly reflects the overall pattern shown in Table 2. Specifically, for
the top pair of panels, showing the models for high-risk activities, there were substantial and
strongly significant differences between much higher levels of high-risk activities pre-pandemic
compared to the first lockdown period across all age groups and both genders. Subsequently, in
August 2020, there was a less dramatic reversal, in the direction of more time being again spent in
high-risk activities. This difference is again, for most gender and age groups, highly significantly
different from first lockdown, but lesser in scale than that observed between the pre-pandemic to
lockdown period. Women and the oldest age group (55+) spent somewhat less time than,
respectively, men and younger age groups, in high risk activities both pre-pandemic and again during
the second lockdown period (indeed for the oldest age group there was no difference between first
10

and second lockdown in the time spent in high-risk activities). Reduction in high risk-activities
associated with the second (November) lockdown was considerably smaller for men and the two
younger (18-34 and 35-54) age groups than observed during first lockdown; consequently the
November lockdown coefficients are statistically significantly different for all groups from those at
first lockdown (with the exception of ages 55+). Four out of the five coefficients for high-risk
activities during the November lockdown are substantially higher (by 50 or more minutes) than
those for the first lockdown, indicating a decrease in reduction of risky behavior in successive
lockdowns (except for the oldest age group).
The middle panels refer to the mid-level risk activities. Differentials here are at first sight similar in
pattern to those for high-risk activities: an initial substantial reduction in time devoted to medium
risk level activities during first lockdown, followed by a smaller reversion during the intermediate
period, most notably among the 35-54 year age group, and women. These groups devoted
significantly more time in the intermediate period to mid-risk-level activities (in particular, leisure,
caring and other socializing activity) with non-household members than men and other age groups,
respectively. The November coefficients show no differences between first and second lockdown for
this level of risk activity.
The bottom pair of panels, describing changes in time devoted to relatively low-infection-risk
activities, show the converse of the top set of panels. The initial very substantial increase in low risk
at-home activities (home leisure taken with other household members; unpaid housework, childand elder-care at home) during first lockdown, particularly for ages 18-34 and 35-54 (who started
from a lower base), may reflect the reduction of paid work commitments, either though home
working, furlough or redundancy. First lockdown was followed by a smaller reversal, again
particularly for women and 35-54 year olds, who increased their low-risk activities during this period
to a greater extent than, respectively, men or other age-groups. As in the case of the medium risk
activities, there is no statistically significant difference in the time spent in these low-risk activities
during first and second lockdown (with the possible exception of women, who spent marginally
statistically significantly less time in these low-risk activities during second lockdown).

Discussion
We have presented a new application of a well-established [18] body of research into daily behavior
collected via continuous and comprehensive 24-hour time use diaries. We show changes in
behavioral response to social restrictions across the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK,
collected in real time at 4 time-points characterized by different regulations. The behavioral changes
revealed are illustrated in Figure 1. One of our primary motivations was to investigate differences in
population behavior between the first and second lockdown, and we were able to demonstrate the
more limited impact of the November restrictions on the UK population’s risk avoidance behavior
(see Table 2). Holding constant gender, age and social grade, the population spent on average 32
more minutes per day in high risk activities in late November 2020 than in first lockdown (recorded
May-June 2020). Looking in more detail at the types of activities (Table 3), the November lockdown
involved more time spent both in leisure or caring activities done away from home with nonhousehold members (12 minutes/day more on average), and in paid work at the workplace (33
minutes/day). Disaggregating the changes by gender and age group shows that these differences in
time spent in high-risk activities between the two lockdown periods applied across all groups, with
the exception of the oldest age group, aged 55+, whose behavior during the second lockdown was
not statistically significantly different from that during first lockdown (see Figure 2, upper pair of
graphs). This suggests that there was perhaps greater awareness of risk among this group, which
was reflected in their behavior. Women and those aged 35-54 in the intermediate period between
lockdowns were more likely to return to medium-risk activities, spending less time in low-risk
activities, than other groups.
At a time when capacity is still limited both in respect both of immunization and track-trace
technology, governments must continue to rely on changes in people’s daily behaviors to contain
the spread of the COVID-19 virus. However, the potential for formulating and evaluating the
imposition of regulations in this way have scarcely begun to be considered.

12

Among the limitations of our current study is the use of a commercial quota-sampling base.
However, it is encouraging that the sample size of approximately 1000 diary days and 350
respondents at each of the four sample time points appears to provide sufficient statistical power to
discern the effects of changes in regulation. In future research, sampling randomly from a national
population frame, and more frequently–either monthly, or, preferably, continuously—would enable
the tracking of changes in behavior alongside changes in rates of infection.
