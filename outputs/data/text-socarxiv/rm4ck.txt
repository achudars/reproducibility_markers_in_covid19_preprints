Abstract
Does the threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic affect interpersonal trust? While most evidence shows that
natural threats reinforce trust and cooperation, the COVID-19 virus differs from other calamities since it spreads
through contact with people, thus potentially increasing mistrust and suspicion towards human beings. We investigate the link between exposure to COVID-19 and trust in strangers by conducting a survey experiment with a
representative sample of adults in Italy, one the countries that has been worst affected by the outbreak of the virus.
Contrary to intuitive expectations, we find that those who report COVID-19 symptoms and those who live in the
municipalities that have been worst affected by the virus trust strangers substantially more than their relative counterparts. In addition, our experimental findings reveal that the risk that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to our health
in the future leads to a substantial increase in trust in strangers. The risk that the pandemic poses to our livelihood,
in terms of job loss and economic recession, also leads to a smaller increase in trust in strangers, while solidarity
appeals and knowledge of people with COVID-19 symptoms within a close circle of relatives, friends and colleagues have no effects on trust. These findings, we suggest, could be explained by adapting the “emancipation
theory of trust” to the context of natural disasters, conjecturing that when caught in catastrophes people become
more dependent on other people’s support.

Introduction
So far most people on the planet have not been infected by the COVID-19 virus1 and an unknown
share of those who have been do not necessarily know they were for they experienced little or no symptoms.2 Most people, however, have been experiencing the pandemic to varying degrees, as a threat – to
their health and livelihood, as well as to those of their families and friends. This global phenomenon
offers an extraordinary opportunity to study how experiencing a natural threat of this nature and on this
scale affects basic interpersonal relations.
Most of the evidence shows that experiencing natural disasters – tsunami, earthquakes, typhoons,
volcanic eruptions – reinforces trust and cooperation (1–7). Yet, the COVID-19 virus differs in important respects from other calamities. While these are geographically circumscribed,3 the virus has
gone global in a few months. Furthermore, the pandemic is not a one-off dramatic event like most other
cataclysms, but creeps on and, crucially for our concern, it spreads by contact with other people.
How should we expect people to respond to the fact that, in a viral sense, l’enfer c’est les autres, as
Jean Paul Sartre remarked? Does the response to the COVID-19 pandemic differ from that elicited by
other natural disasters, and leads to a lowering of interpersonal trust? One can easily think of arguments
going either way and the scant evidence is inconclusive. On the one hand, the manner in which people
become infected turns every person into a threat. How dangerous every person turns out to be greatly
depends on how much she respects certain rules – social distancing, hand washing, wearing masks and,
above all, complying with quarantine when feeling ill or after being in contact with infected people. If
we search in the past for enlightenment, the Black Death of the 14th century seems to have negatively
affected inter-group relations (8, 9). An unpublished study claims that so did the 1918 devastating
Spanish flu (10), while survey data from Canada provide tenuous evidence that trust in neighbors may

In a new study the Office of National Statistics in the UK found that “The analysis of those reporting evidence of symptoms appears to show that those reporting symptoms are much more likely to have contracted the virus. However, additional
analysis shows that, of those who tested positive, only 33% (95% confidence interval: 25% to 43%) reported any evidence
of symptoms at the time of their swab test or at either the preceding or subsequent swab test.” (35).

March 2020 (11).
On the other hand, the features of the pandemic could make us feel “in the same boat” with others,
intensifying our sense of solidarity and shared humanity. Also, we could feel more in need of other
people’s support and encourage others to trust us by opening up and trusting them first. A recently published study by Esaiasson and colleagues (12) finds that interpersonal trust registered a slight increase
during the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis in Sweden between March and April 2020. A survey
carried out in Italy, and regularly repeated since December 2016, found that in April 2020 the share of
respondents who believe that most people can be trusted is the highest since the beginning of these reports (13).
To answer the question of whether the COVID-19 virus is enhancing or eroding trust in our fellow
humans we study the Italian case. One of the worst affected countries, Italy has already suffered 34,767
deaths (1st July 2020) amounting to 575 deaths per million population; at the time of writing, worse
than Italy on this measure were only Belgium (842), UK (644) and Spain (606).4
We proceed by addressing two connected questions: first, we aim to find out whether the intensity
of actual exposure to the virus of an individual either personally or vicariously through his or her network of friends and family, correlates with the individual’s trust in strangers. To obtain the measures of
both trust and exposure to the virus we survey a representative sample of the Italian adult population; to
measure exposure we further use secondary data on excess deaths by municipality. Next, through an
experiment embedded in the survey we try to identify which aspect of virus exposure – whether fear for
one’s health or one’s welfare, or a heightened pressure to show solidarity – may be causing variations
in trust.
In what follows, we begin by explaining our measures and methods, then present the survey results
pertaining to our first question and then the results of the survey experiment addressing our second
question. We conclude by discussing the mechanisms that may account for our results.

Measures and design
Between 30th April and 19th May 2020, that is between the second and the third month of the lockdown
imposed by Italian authorities, we surveyed a representative sample of Italian adults (N=1163). In the
survey we include the standard question on generalized trust used by countless sources, including the
Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT).5 However, since this question suffers from several limitations (14–19), we also employ a further question. Originally designed by Soroka, Helliwell, and Johnston (20), and inspired by an earlier field experiment (21), the question asks respondents how much,
should they lose their wallet, they trust a neighbor, a police officer or a stranger to return it.6 This question refers to a specific behavior (returning a wallet) and specific categories of individuals, thus increasing our confidence that all the respondents interpret the question in the same way. The analysis
indicates that trust in strangers in the wallet question correlates with the standard measure of generalized trust more strongly than trust in either neighbors or the police, thus suggesting that trust in
strangers returning one’s lost wallet well approximates generalized interpersonal trust, and we use this
as our main measure (see Table S2).

Virus exposure. To some extent everyone who knew about the virus must have felt it as a threat, and
in this sense, everyone in our sample was ‘treated’. To capture whether different degrees of self-reported or objective exposure to the COVID-19 virus correlate with differences in trust, we had to measure the intensity of exposure, which we did in two ways. First, in the survey we asked respondents
whether since the beginning of the year they had suffered from COVID-19 symptoms – such as fever,
dry cough, or loss of smell and taste. Eleven percent of our sample replied “Yes”, a figure close to that
found by a survey in the UK, in which 13 percent of respondents reported having had coronavirus

The question reads as follows: “Generally speaking, do you think most of the people can be trusted, or we need to be very
careful?”
5

The respondents could choose among four possible answers: “Very likely”, “Quite likely”, “Slightly likely”, “Not at all
likely”. We rescale the answers from 0 (“Not at all likely”) to 1 (“Very likely”) and treat the variable as an interval variable.
The version we use is that used by ISTAT.

symptoms7 – incidentally, both these figure suggests that official statistics reporting confirmed cases of
COVID-19 largely underreported the spread of the virus in the population.8
Next, in order to obtain a measure of vicarious exposure to the coronavirus for each respondent, we
asked whether anyone among their close peers had suffered from COVID-19, and if so, we further
asked them to report how many they knew. We find that 16 percent of our sample knew of at least one
family member, cohabitant or relative, 35 percent knew of at least one friend or acquaintance, and 15
percent knew of at least one work colleague who suffered from COVID-19. In the analysis, we combine these responses into an additive index of knowledge of people with COVID-19 within the respondent’s social network, rescaled from 0 to 5 (equal to 5 people or more).
Besides self-reported measures, in order to obtain an ecological measure of the strength of the contagion in each respondent’s area we calculate excess deaths by municipality, that is the difference between the number of deaths in the months of February, March and April 2020 and the average number
of deaths in the same period in the previous five years.9 We then matched this data with each respondent’s municipality of residence. We succeeded in matching 1099 respondents from 566 municipalities
out of a total of 621 municipalities included in our sample.10
Besides being the only available indicator at the municipality level at the time of writing, excess
deaths has the advantage of ruling out geographical discrepancies in the number of reported cases of
COVID-19, due to differences in testing frequencies. Furthermore, it overcomes the general problem of
underreporting COVID-19 related deaths (22). The downside, however, is that the measure is sensitive
to population size: in small municipalities, an increase (or decrease) of a few deaths in 2020 compared
to previous years translates into a large percentage increase (decrease). Indeed, we find an increasing
number of outliers in the measure of excess deaths as the population of the municipality decreases. To

According to the Italian Ministry of Health, on 1st May 2020 the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy
was 207,428, which corresponds to 0.34 percent of the population.

We could not match all the municipalities in our dataset because ISTAT released the data only for 7,270 municipalities,
corresponding to 92% of the total of 7,904 Italian municipalities.

alleviate this problem, we weighed the measure by population size, assigning smaller weights to
smaller municipalities. In addition, we divide the original measure into quintiles, in order to test for
non-linear effects. (See SI Appendix section B).
We find reassuringly that self-reported symptoms of COVID-19 virus in our survey, whether experienced personally by respondents or indirectly by the respondents’ social network, correlate with the
measure of excess deaths at the municipality level. An increase of one standard deviation in excess deaths
is associated with a 0.04 increase in the likelihood that the respondent suffered from COVID-19, and a
0.23 increase of people with COVID-19 symptoms in the respondents’ social network (see Table S11).

Survey experiment. Our respondents were randomly assigned to one of three treatments in which they
were asked to read a text of around 110 words, or to the control condition in which they did not read
any texts and moved directly to the outcome questions. Each text highlights one of three dimensions of
the pandemic: risk to health, risk to livelihood, and as an enhancement of solidarity. The information
used to create these texts was taken only from reliable and publicly available sources. Only after reading these texts, the respondents replied to the questions on trust.
In the “risk to health” condition we highlighted the uncertainties related to the diffusion of the virus, including, for example, the fact that we do not know when a vaccine will be available and whether
there will be a second wave of the pandemic. In the “risk to livelihood” condition we illustrated how
the pandemic will hit the economy based on projections mostly by the IMF and the ILO. We mentioned
that the pandemic will lead to a global economic recession with serious consequences for the labor
market. In the “solidarity” condition we mentioned the need for global cooperation and solidarity to
contain the pandemic and prevent future ones. We essentially presented the respondents with the rhetoric of “we are all in the same boat” that was repeatedly voiced by the UN Secretary General, among
many others. (See SI Appendix E for the texts of the treatments.)

Results
Those who report suffering from COVID-19 symptoms are 9.4 percentage points more likely to trust
strangers as measured by the wallet test than those who do not report any symptoms (plot A, Fig. 1).
The effect is sizeable – corresponding to 0.37 standard deviations –, robust to alternative model specifications (see Tables S3-S5), and larger than the only other predictor that is significantly and positively
correlated to trust, that is working outside home compared to working from home (an increase of 0.25
standard deviations in trust). Furthermore, individuals who suffered from COVID-19 are also more
likely to trust their neighbors. The effect on neighbors is smaller than that on strangers – an increase of
7.6 percent or 0.27 standard deviations – but remarkable nonetheless for it pushes trust in neighbors
even higher than it is already regardless of virus exposure (see Table S6).
When instead of the symptoms of the individuals we analyze our measure of vicarious exposure in
the individual’s network we do not find an effect (plot B, Fig. 1). Knowing an increasing number of
people who suffered from COVID-19 is not associated with higher trust in strangers. However, we find
that regardless of whether one has personally experienced COVID-19 symptoms, our measure of excess deaths is positively associated with trust in strangers (plot C, Fig. 1): those living in the most affected municipalities (fifth quintile) are 10 percentage points more likely to trust strangers than those
who live in the least affected municipalities (first quintile). If we treat the measure of excess deaths as
an interval variable, we find that an increase of one standard deviation in excess deaths is associated
with an increase of 0.10 standard deviations in trust in strangers (see Table S4).

These results highlight a robust correlation between personal exposure to COVID-19 and interpersonal trust. By contrast, knowing someone close who has that experience does not seem to make a difference. However, respondents are not indifferent to what is happening around them for it seems that
residing in a location which has been suffering from a higher number of excess deaths increases their
trust in strangers too.
These results alone, however, cannot guarantee that it is the exposure to the coronavirus that leads
to higher trust. Inverse causation – that is, from trust to exposure – is conceivable as people who are
more trusting may have been less guarded in their behavior and caught the virus more frequently.11 To

The evidence so far is limited and ambiguous. In SI Appendix C we list some studies that point in both directions, that is
from exposure to trust, or from trust to exposure.

help us establish the direction of causality, we can draw from the same pool of respondents from which
our survey respondents are drawn. They were surveyed at different points in time in the period 20152019 (before the COVID-19 outbreak), by the same survey company that carried out our study and
manages the pool. These surveys asked respondents how much trust they have in, respectively, Italians,
friends, and colleagues, offering four fixed answers, from ‘none’ to ‘much’, and asked them to choose
one.12 We link the replies of the respondents who are also in our survey with whether they report
symptoms of the virus in 2020 (see Table S12), and find no effect: those who express more trust in preCOVID times are no more likely to report COVID-19 symptoms in 2020. We can thus prudently conclude that our findings are unlikely to be driven by inverse causality.

Treatment effects on trust. We focus now on our survey experiment, which helps us identify the aspect of the pandemic that could be behind the increase in interpersonal trust. Obviously, we cannot use
real stimuli hence we prime subjects by substituting real ‘exposure’ with evocative texts they have to
read before replying to the trust questions. The advantage, of course, is that the random assignment to
our four experimental groups meets the criteria for causal identification. A further advantage is that
everyone in the sample is exposed to the prime, hence we can identify the population average treatment
effect (ATE). In other words, we can observe the potential effects the pandemic could have on trust on
average, among Italians, and not only among those who report suffering from COVID-19 symptoms.
The analysis of the ATEs on trust in strangers relative to the control (Figure 2) yields three results:
(i) the “solidarity” condition does not affect the willingness to trust strangers; (ii) the “risk to livelihood” condition, that is reminding the respondents of how the pandemic might hit the economy and the
labor market in the future, causes a statistically significant increase in trust of 4.5 percentage points
(p<0.1); (iii) the “risk to health” has an effect that is more than twice as large: when reminded of the
uncertainties for our health that could be brought about by COVID-19, respondents are more likely to

trust strangers by an additional 10 percentage points relative to the control group, corresponding to 0.37
standard deviations. The effects are robust to alternative model specifications (see Table S7).13

Mechanisms
Why should exposure to COVID-19 or just to be reminded of the threats that it poses to our livelihood and
health, lead us to trust strangers more? The literature identifies various channels that could explain why natural disasters can enhance trust and cooperation. Two notable ones are the sustained and emotionally
charged social interactions that accompany cataclysms and the mutual practical help that develops during

Our treatments do not produce statistically significant effects on trust in neighbours and the police; we also do not find an
effect on the standard question on generalized trust (see Table S8).

9

the reconstruction phases (2, p. 91). Neither of these apply to COVID-19, however, due to social distancing
that if anything makes us more isolated from others and the lack of destruction of physical assets.
A third conceivable mechanism seems ruled out by our survey experiment. One could surmise that
COVID-19 increases empathy towards our fellow humans – the idea that we are all “in the same boat”
facing an invisible threat. Some general evidence indicates that empathic concerns towards vulnerable
members of a society promote prosocial behavior (23, 24), and, some specific evidence suggests that empathic concerns might stimulate compliance with social distancing and hygienic rules during the COVID19 pandemic (25). If these effects are observed or expected, they may in turn lead to an increase in trust
in unknown others. However, our “solidarity” treatment condition, in which we remind respondents of
the moral duty to show solidarity towards the most vulnerable has no effect on trust in strangers. Even if
empathy and pro-sociality increase, this does not seem, immediately at least, to rebound on making individuals readier to rely on unknown others.
The fourth mechanism we consider has to do with the fear of succumbing to the pandemic. Either
experiencing the actual symptoms of the COVID-19 virus or just the fear that we may be struck by it
could make us feel more needy, more dependent on the support of others. Trusting might function as a
coping disposition for dealing with the risks related to the spread of the virus. It could result from wishful
thinking, from the greater hope, that is, that others are helpful and trustworthy. But it could also be a wish
to signal one’s openness to others and to learn about their trustworthiness.
This conjecture has some intuitive appeal and, more importantly, bears an analytical connection with
a well-tested theory, that trust is higher when people have stronger reasons to seek “outward exposure” in
order to find strangers they can rely on. Known as the “emancipation theory of trust”, it was originally
proposed by Toshio Yamagishi and his colleagues (26–28) in a completely different context to a pandemic, namely to explain why US citizens, members of a highly mobile society, were found to be more
trusting of strangers than the Japanese, who belong to a more traditional and committed society that relies
on family and groups. The theoretical argument maintains that the less encompassing traditional or institutional ties are, the more people feel encouraged to be open to and actively look for strangers on whom

10

they can count. The pandemic would be a different source -- transient and dramatic rather than structural
and habitual -- that increases the need of seeking outward exposure.14
If this conjecture is warranted some testable implications follow, the more general one of which is
that people who are needier and frailer should trust others more. If we use age as a proxy of increasingly
poorer health conditions we find that age has indeed a positive effect on trusting in our data as in many
other surveys and experiments (29, 30). In our data it reveals a curvilinear relationship, in which trust decreases slightly as people reach their fifties, and then increases markedly from around age 65 (see Figure
S1 in Appendix), arguably a sign that as one becomes frailer, lonelier and needier one becomes more
trustful, regardless of COVID-19.15
If the conjecture is plausible, we should further find that people in weaker positions, because of greater
social isolation or financial hardship react more strongly when developing the symptoms of the infection
and when exposed to our treatments in the experiment, and trust strangers more than similar people in
stronger social and financial positions. In order to test these implications, we analyze a series of interactions
to provide descriptive evidence16 of whether the effects on trusting strangers linked to being exposed to the
virus, whether in real life or by being primed, differ across specific socio-demographic indicators.
First, we use living alone as a proxy for social isolation (Figure 3, top row). We find no differences
in the effects of the treatments. In particular, the health treatment has the same effect among those who
live alone and those who do not. However, reality seems to bite harder than imagined scenarios and we
do indeed find that trust in strangers is a whopping 20 percentage points higher among those who report
the virus symptoms and live alone, compared to those who report the symptoms but live with other peo-

14

Three studies found supporting evidence for the emancipation theory by looking at the effects on trust of the strength of
family ties. Ermisch and Gambetta used a trust-game experiment with a random sub-sample of British citizens drawn from
the British Household Panel Survey and found that trusters with strong family ties are less likely to trust anonymous trustees
in the game (37); Alesina and Giuliano used the World Value Survey to measure family ties and found that it correlates negatively with the standard trust question employed in surveys (38); Herreros also used the WVS and a different measure of
the intensity of family ties and found the same results (39).
15

It is no accident that fraudsters disproportionally target older people (40).

16

Since our moderating variables are observed and not randomly assigned, we do not claim that they cause the effect of the
treatment to be larger or smaller (41).

ple. When we use excess deaths as a measure of exposure to COVID-19 we obtain a similar pattern, although the effect of living in highly affected versus weakly affected municipalities does not differ significantly depending on whether respondents live alone or with other people (see Table S9).

12

Next, we look at economic conditions (Figure 3, bottom row). We use a self-reported measure that
we recode in two categories: those who state that their income allows them to live comfortably (good
condition), and those who perceive some difficulties or struggle to reach the end of the month (not
good condition). When we interact perceived economic conditions with individual COVID-19 symptoms, we find that for those in good economic condition, suffering from COVID-19 symptoms has no
effect on trust, while among those who perceive some difficulties the effect is significantly larger. Living in highly affected municipalities too is associated to a larger increase in trust among those who are
not in good economic condition, although the differences between categories of economic conditions
are not significant. As for the effects of the treatments in our experiment, the results are clear: people in
a difficult economic condition strongly react to the different aspects of the pandemic by trusting
strangers substantially more than the people in a good economic condition. Those who feel financially
more exposed, and arguably may need or expect to need help from other people, respond to the threat
that COVID-19 poses to health, livelihood and also to the duty to demonstrate solidarity, by increasing
their trust in strangers (see Table S10).

Conclusion
Does the threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic affect interpersonal trust? While being a natural
menace, the COVID-19 virus differs from other disasters – such as earthquakes and hurricanes – in at
least one peculiar aspect, namely that it spreads through contact with people. Thus, instead of reinforcing cooperation – as most calamities do (1–7) – the COVID-19 pandemic might be expected to increase
mistrust and suspicion towards other human beings.
We investigated the link between exposure to COVID-19 and trust in strangers by surveying a representative sample of adults in Italy, one the countries that has been worst affected by the outbreak of
the virus. Our findings show no support for the potentially negative influence of the virus on trust. On
the contrary, we find that those who report COVID-19 symptoms and those who live in the municipalities that have been worst affected by the virus trust strangers substantially more than their relative
counterparts (an increase of 9 and 10 percentage points respectively). Among the possible aspects of
the COVID-19 pandemic, our experimental findings reveal that it is mostly the risk that it poses to our
13

health in the future that leads to a substantial increase in trust in strangers (a 10 percentage points increase). The risk that the pandemic poses to our livelihood, in terms of job loss and economic recession, also induces people to trust strangers more by a smaller (4 to 5 percentage points) but statistically
significant (p<0.1) amount. By contrast, we find that solidarity appeals – based on the frequently
voiced rhetoric that “we are all in the same boat” – and also knowing people with COVID-19 symptoms within a close circle of relatives, friends and colleagues have no effects on trust.
These findings, we suggest, could be explained by adapting the “emancipation theory of trust”
(26–28) to the context of natural disasters, conjecturing that when caught in catastrophes people become more dependent on other people’s support. By threatening both our health and our livelihood, the
COVID-19 pandemic increases our need for seeking outward exposure. Trusting strangers, therefore,
functions as a coping mechanism to learn about other people’s trustworthiness and eventually rely on
them to improve our material condition. The fact that it is mostly those who live alone and those who
are in a difficult economic condition who strongly react to the risks to health and livelihood posed by
COVID-19 by trusting strangers substantially more supports the importance of trust in times of need.
Our results contribute to research on trust by showing that, despite its peculiar features, the natural
threat of COVID-19 reinforces interpersonal trust, in line with evidence from other calamities. As the
COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread globally its longer term effects on trust remain unknown.

Materials and Methods
We surveyed a quota sample matching the adult Italian population on gender, age and geographical
area of residence (N=1163).17 In order to obtain a representative sample we further weighed it by level
of education and political preferences as expressed in the vote in the 2019 European elections. 18

17

We included our questions in an omnibus study conducted by the survey company SWG. The questions were vetted by
SWG and the respondents provided informed consent to participate in the study. Due to space limitation, we included a first
set of questions and the experiment in a first round between 30 th April and 4th May, and then re-interviewed the same participants with an additional set of questions between 14 th and 19th May. (For further details on data collection and the timeline
of the main lockdown measures in Italy, see SI Appendix section D.)
18

We apply weights to the entire analysis.

14

We analyze the data using standard regressions models. In each model we include individual-level
and municipality-level covariates to control for confounding factors. At individual level, we control for
factors that have been shown to correlate with the spread of COVID-19, such as respondents’ gender
(31), age (32), and household condition, i.e., whether respondents live by themselves or with other people (33).19 In addition, we control for respondents’ education level, the employment situation during
the lockdown (separating those who worked from home from those who continued working outside
home), and perceived economic condition.
At municipality level we control for a number of indicators provided by ISTAT for the year 2018,
which might correlate with the spread of the virus, including the number of inhabitants (logged), the
population density (logged), the ratio of males over females (deciles), and the share of people aged
above 65 (deciles). In addition, we control for the employment rate in 2018 (deciles).20 Lastly, in each
model we include an indicator for how strongly the respondent’s region of residence has been hit by the
virus ranked in three categories: strongly hit (more than 3 deaths per 10,000 inhabitants), moderately
hit (between 1 and 3 deaths), and weakly hit (less than 1 death).21 In SI Appendix we include models
with alternative specifications, in which we control for the five standard geographical areas of residence in Italy, i.e., North-West, North-East, Centre, South, and Islands (see summary statistics in Table
S1 and SI Appendix section B). Since including covariates might artificially inflate statistical significance (34), we also run naïve regression models in which we control only for geographical areas, obtaining substantially similar results.

B. Measuring exposure to Covid-19
Figure S2 shows the distribution of our measure of excess deaths for the 566 municipalities included in our
sample by quintiles of population. We find that the presence of outliers – that is, municipalities with an
excessively large percentage increase in excess deaths in February-April 2020 – decreases as the size of the
municipality in terms of population increases.

We therefore decided to create a weighted index of excess death in which we reduced the value of excess
deaths in small municipalities. More specifically, we multiplied the original measure of excess death by
population quintiles, assigning the values of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1 to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th quintile
respectively.

C. Testing for inverse causality
Our results show a positive correlation between being exposed to the coronavirus and trust in
strangers. However, we cannot be sure whether it is exposure to the coronavirus that leads to higher
trust, or whether it is the other way round, since it is conceivable that people who are more trusting
may have been less guarded in their behavior and caught the virus more frequently. The evidence so
far is limited and ambiguous. Two studies find that those who believe that most other people can be
trusted are less likely to engage in protective measures in the US and seven European countries,
Italy included (Jørgensen, Bor, and Petersen 2020; Olsen and Hjorth 2020). One could therefore
suspect that trusting people are more at risk of catching COVID-19.

However, we have evidence pointing in the opposite direction from Sweden and Italy where social
trust seems to have increased during the lockdown (Demos & PI 2020; Esaiasson et al. 2020)
relatively to the level it was some time before the pandemic broke out. In addition, a study that
compares areas with high social capital with areas with low social capital in seven European
countries, including Italy, finds that COVID-19 cases have been increasing faster in the areas with
low social capital (Bartscher et al. 2020). Since interpersonal trust and social capital are known to
be correlated (Putnam 2000), these findings suggest that where trust is higher people are less likely
to spread the virus, arguably because, the authors of the study conjecture, people are more likely to
(voluntarily) adopt “informal rules of containment” (Bartscher et al. 2020, p.2).

To help us establish the direction of causality, we exploit our pool of respondents. They were
surveyed at different points in time in the period 2015-2019, by the same survey company that
carried out our study. These surveys ask respondents how much trust they have in Italians, in
friends, and in colleagues, offering four sets of answers, from ‘none’ to ‘much’, and asked them to
choose one. Approximately half of our sample replied to these questions. In the regression models,
we recoded the answers to these questions in three categories, in order to account for the missing
responses: low trust (corresponding to “no trust” or “little trust”), high trust (corresponding to
“some trust” or “much trust”), and missing (including those who replied “don’t know” and those
who did not reply to these questions before 2020). We regressed suffering from COVID-19 in 2020
on these measures of trust and we find no effects, meaning that those who express more trust in preCOVID times are no more likely to report COVID-19 symptoms in 2020. Table S12 displays the
results.

D. Data collection and timeline of lockdown measures
Between 30th April and 19th May 2020 we included a set of questions in an omnibus study that is
routinely conducted by the survey company SWG relying on a large online pool of respondents.
The sample is a quota sample matching the adult Italian population on gender, age and geographical
area of residence. In addition, we weighed the sample by level of education and political
preferences as expressed in the vote in the 2019 European elections, in order to obtain a
representative sample of Italian adults.

Due to space limitation, we could include only a limited set of questions in the omnibus study, thus
we interviewed the respondents in two rounds. In the first round – conducted between 30th April and
4th May – we included the “wallet questions” on trust, the experiment, and all the sociodemographic questions. Between 14th and 19th May, we re-interviewed the same respondents in a
second round, in which we included the questions on individual COVID-19 symptoms, knowledge
of people with COVID-19 and the standard question on trust. In total, 1163 respondents replied to
our questions, with a drop out of 9% from the first to the second round.
Timeline of main lockdown measures in Italy1

The Coronavirus has been causing the most
serious health crisis of the last century. The
uncertainties for our health are very high. At
present, we are unable to identify everyone who
has contracted the virus, nor how long they will
be immune, and we don't even know when we
will have a vaccine.

Il coronavirus sta causando la più grave crisi
sanitaria dell’ultimo secolo. Le incertezze per la
nostra salute sono molto elevate. Per ora non siamo
in grado di identificare tutti coloro che hanno
contratto il virus, né per quanto tempo saranno
immuni, e non sappiamo nemmeno quando avremo
un vaccino.

If Covid-19 resembles the flu, new waves of
infection could occur and we may have to go back
to quarantine. Furthermore, the exploitation of
natural habitats and the ease with which we travel
increase the risk of new viruses emerging, and it’s
likely that new pandemics will occur in the future.

Se il Covid-19 assomigliasse all’influenza,
potrebbero verificarsi nuove ondate di contagi e
potremmo dover tornare in quarantena. Inoltre, lo
sfruttamento degli habitat naturali e la facilità con
cui si viaggia aumentano il rischio che emergano
nuovi virus ed è probabile che in futuro avvengano
nuove pandemie.

pandemia.
The Coronavirus has been causing the most severe
economic damage since World War II, with
devastating losses for workers and businesses. In
2020 a very heavy world recession is expected.
Among the most affected countries, Italy risks a
loss of 9 points of GDP and a public debt of over
2500 billion.

Il coronavirus sta causando i danni economici più
severi dalla seconda guerra mondiale, con perdite
devastanti per lavoratori e imprese. Nel 2020 si
prospetta una recessione mondiale molto pesante.
Fra i paesi più colpiti, l’Italia rischia una perdita di
9 punti del PIL e un debito pubblico superiore ai
2500 miliardi.

At least 17 million people in Europe and 26
million Americans have lost their jobs. In Italy,
the unemployed should exceed three million by
the end of 2020. The repercussions on the global
economy will last long and it is impossible to
predict when there will be a recovery.

Almeno 17 milioni di persone in Europa e 26 milioni
di americani hanno perso il lavoro. In Italia i
disoccupati dovrebbero superare i tre milioni a fine
2020. Le ricadute sull’economia globale dureranno a
lungo ed è impossibile prevedere quando ci sarà una
ripresa.

Group 4 (solidarity)
Before proceeding with the questions, we would
like you to carefully consider the situation created
by the pandemic.

Prima di procedere con le domande, le chiediamo di
considerare attentamente la situazione creata dalla
pandemia.

The Coronavirus has been causing the most severe
human and economic damage since World War II.
The virus ignores borders and only an effort of
solidarity and international cooperation can stem
contagion and prevent future pandemics.

Il coronavirus sta causando i danni umani ed
economici più severi dalla seconda guerra mondiale.
Il virus ignora i confini e soltanto uno sforzo di
solidarietà e cooperazione internazionale potrà
arginare il contagio e prevenire pandemie future.

We are all vulnerable to infection, but not all
equally. Protective networks must be created for
the most vulnerable and for those in poverty. The
Coronavirus crisis gives us the opportunity to
demonstrate global solidarity and rediscover our
common humanity beyond ethnicity, nationality
and religion.

Siamo tutti vulnerabili all’infezione, ma non tutti allo
stesso modo. È necessario creare delle reti di
protezione per i più vulnerabili e per chi si trova in
condizioni di povertà. La crisi del coronavirus ci dà
l’opportunità di dimostrare una solidarietà globale e
riscoprire la nostra comune umanità al di là di etnia,
nazionalità e religione.
