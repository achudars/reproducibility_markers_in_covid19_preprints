Abstract
During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Mayor Bill de Blasio
ordered the release of New York City jail inmates who were at high risk of contracting
the disease and at low risk of committing criminal reoffense. Using public information,
we construct and analyze a database of nearly 350,000 incarceration episodes in the city
jail system from 2014 – 2020. In concordance with de Blasio’s stated policy, inmates
discharged immediately after his order were at a lower risk of reoffense than inmates
discharged during the same calendar week in previous years. The inmates in the former
group were also slightly older, on average, than those in the latter group, although the
overall age distributions of the two groups were quite similar. Additionally, the inmates
of the former group had spent dramatically longer in jail than those in the latter group.
With the release of long-serving inmates demonstrated to be feasible, we also examine
how the jail population would have looked over the past six years had caps in
incarceration been in place. With a cap of one year, the system would experience a 15%
decrease in incarceration. With a cap of 100 days, the reduction would be over 50%.
Because our results are only as accurate as New York City’s public-facing jail data, we
discuss numerous challenges with this data and suggest improvements. These
improvements would address issues including inmate age, gender, and race. Finally, we
discuss policy implications of our work, highlight some opportunities and challenges
posed by incarceration caps, and suggest key areas for reform. It is striking that the de
Blasio administration was able to identify inmates at low risk of reoffense and was
willing to release them. Their success with discharge during the early stages of
COVID-19 suggests that low-risk inmates could be discharged sooner in general.

Introduction

1

New York City’s COVID-19 outbreak surged in late March 2020 and had immediate
impact on the city’s jail populations. As of Saturday, March 14, Rikers Island, the
largest of the city’s jails, had confirmed 38 COVID-19 cases, up from eight the previous
day. Under the simple assumption of exponential growth early in a pandemic, the entire
jail system, with approximately 5,300 inmates and 1,000 employees, could have been
infected in two weeks. Jails had already started taking public health precautions such as
limiting visitors, equipping guards with personal protective equipment, cleaning shared
surfaces more frequently, and mandating that inmates in bunk beds sleep head-to-toe.

Many jail staffers worried that these measures would not be sufficient to prevent a
mass outbreak [1].
City officials and public defenders called attention to vulnerable populations within
the city jail system. For example, the chief medical officer of the city’s Correctional
Health Services tweeted, “We cannot socially distance dozens of elderly men living in a
dorm, sharing a bathroom” [2]. Another physician within the jail system stated, “The
only meaningful public health intervention here is to depopulate the jails
dramatically” [1].
On March 24, Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered the immediate discharge of inmates who
were at high risk of contracting COVID-19 and low risk of reoffending [3]. Public
defenders urged de Blasio to widen his criteria, highlighting conditions inside the jails,
where inmates were frequently denied basic sanitary products or protective
equipment [4]. De Blasio’s administration responded, and by mid-April, as we will show,
the jail population had decreased by 30%.
Whom did the city decide was both at a high risk of contracting the virus and a low
risk of reoffending? What do these decisions imply about potential future reforms to the
city’s incarceration policy? Our study answers these questions by studying public data
from the New York City jail system over the past six years.

In the United States, prisons incarcerate individuals who have committed serious crimes
and have long sentences. In contrast, jails play multiple roles in the justice system. The
primary purpose of a jail is to provide temporary detainment to pre-trial defendants,
either to ensure their attendance at trial or to mitigate the immediate threat they pose
to public safety. But depending on the municipality, a jail may also contain locally
sentenced inmates serving short sentences, state-sentenced inmates awaiting transfer to
a long-term state prison, parole or probation violators awaiting a hearing, or detainees
of federal law enforcement agencies [5]. As a result, while US prisons are usually
segregated by gender, age, and offense level, a US jail holds a widely diverse population
in all three categories. Researchers have long acknowledged the role of jail population
growth in the meteoric rise of the national incarceration rate over the last 40 years [6].
During this time, the heterogeneous nature of the country’s decentralized, municipal jail
system has made jail populations difficult to analyze, manage, and reform [7].
In 2015, the need for sweeping reform to, specifically, the jail system of New York
City became more stark in the wake of Kalief Browder’s suicide. Browder, then sixteen
years old, had been arrested for allegedly stealing a backpack in 2010, detained for three
years in New York City’s Rikers Island jail awaiting a trial date, and then released due
to a lack of evidence. Due to the persistent abuse and violent treatment that he
received from correctional officers, Browder’s mental health had quickly deteriorated,
and during his three years in jail, he had committed multiple acts of self-harm,
including at least one suicide attempt [8]. “Being home is way better than being in jail,”
Browder told a journalist from The New Yorker, a year after his release, and six months
before his suicide. “But in my mind right now I feel like I’m still in jail, because I’m
still feeling the side effects from what happened in there. . . I feel like I was robbed of my
happiness” [9].
Browder’s story, as well as hundreds of other accounts of systemic abuse and
injustice in the Rikers Island jail [10, 11], inspired criminal justice advocates to fight for
change. In October 2019, the city council approved an $8 billion plan to close Rikers
and replace it with new, smaller facilities scattered throughout the city [12]. These
facilities would have a combined capacity of 3,300, which would require a reduction in
jail population of over 50%. Thus, by necessity, jail population reduction became a
priority for the de Blasio administration.

To accomplish this goal, jail reformers urged the state to enact a longtime policy
objective: bail reform. The United States justice system’s reliance on pretrial bail has
been widely criticized as a mechanism of jailing people simply for being poor. It has
also come under focus as a driver of racial inequity, because a disproportionate number
of defendants in New York City who cannot pay bail are Black or Hispanic [13]. In
July 2018, New York City’s Independent Commission on Criminal Justice and
Incarceration Reform wrote that “Money bail is the preeminent driver of the jail
population in New York City” [14]. As of May 2018, nearly 75% of inmates in jail were
pretrial, with the vast majority there simply because they could not afford bail. The
Commission found that an expanded supervised release program, under which
defendants would be allowed to remain in the community as long as they submitted to
frequent monitoring by city-employed social workers, would lower jail populations while
successfully ensuring that defendants attended their court dates.
New York State helped expedite this reform in March, 2019 by abolishing the use of
cash bail for all defendants, save those charged with certain violent felonies. This bail
reform law went into effect January 1, 2020, but judges began applying it retroactively
to inmates already in jail for not posting bail in November, 2019 [15]. As a result, the
city’s jail population dropped from approximately 7,000 at the beginning of November
to just over 5,300 at the beginning of February, 2020 ––– a reduction of nearly 25%.
Three months later, however, Governor Andrew Cuomo slightly rolled back the reform
by allowing bail to be used for defendants charged with an additional list of 25
offenses [16].

As compared to the United States’ general population, the incarcerated population is
more vulnerable to a wide range of infectious diseases, due to both its underlying racial
and socioeconomic demographics, and to high levels of transmission between
inmates [17]. The spread of illness in jails, specifically, is of interest to public health
researchers because it has significant influence on spread in the surrounding
communities, as most inmates in jails are discharged within a few weeks [18]. In
particular, jail and prison inmates across the country [19] and in New York City [12]
have contracted COVID-19 at a dramatically higher rate than the general population.
Reducing jail populations has had a demonstrable effect on reducing spread of
COVID-19 both within jails [20, 21] and in the community [22].

Given the ongoing debates about criminal justice reform, and given the continuing
worldwide struggle to find effective public policies to curtail the spread of COVID-19,
the study of New York City’s inmate discharge policy in March 2020 is a pressing
matter. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
In Methods, we present our procedure for gathering, reconciling, and cleaning data
that we obtain from the city’s Open Data Portal. Our data set consists of nearly
350,000 records, each of which describes an incarceration episode.
In Analysis and Results, we report our findings. The city jail population did decrease
substantially from March 23 – 29, 2020, following de Blasio’s policy charge. Inmates
discharged immediately after his order were at a lower risk of reoffense than inmates
discharged during the same calendar week in previous years. The inmates in the former
group were also slightly older, on average, than those in the latter group, although the
overall age distributions of the two groups were quite similar. Additionally, the inmates
of the former group had spent dramatically longer in jail than those in the latter group.

With the release of long-serving inmates demonstrated to be feasible, and keeping in
mind that the jail system is intended for short-term incarceration, in Policy, we examine
how the jail population would have looked over the past six years had caps in
incarceration been in place. With a cap of one year, the system would experience a 15%
decrease in incarceration. With a cap of 100 days, the reduction would be over 50%.
Because our results are only as accurate as New York City’s public-facing jail data,
in Data Recommendations, we discuss numerous challenges with this data and suggest
improvements. These improvements would address issues including inmate age, gender,
and race.
Finally, in Discussion and Conclusions, we discuss policy implications of our work,
highlight some opportunities and challenges posed by incarceration caps, and suggest
key areas for reform. It is striking that the de Blasio administration was able to identify
inmates at low risk of reoffense and was willing to release them. Their success with
discharge during the early stages of COVID-19 suggests that low-risk inmates could be
discharged sooner in general.

We obtain data from the New York City Open Data Portal [23], which was built for
compliance with the city’s Open Data Law, signed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg in
2012. The portal includes two data sets entitled Inmate Admissions and Inmate
Discharges. These data sets provide historical information and are the basis of our
study. Additionally, the portal includes a data set entitled Daily Inmates in Custody,
which provides information about individuals who are currently incarcerated. This data
set is not cumulative in time, is replaced online every day, and is not archived, rendering
it unusable for historical study. However, we use it to resolve a small number of data
anomalies, as we describe later.
In the following subsections, we detail the production of our final data set. The
primary steps in this process are data acquisition, reconciliation of erroneous records,
and cleaning of demographic and other variables, including removal of outliers.

The Inmate Admissions data set (ADS) and Inmate Discharges data set (DDS) files are
updated at the start of each month. We downloaded both in .csv format on January 9,
2020, after their January 1 update. Upon download, ADS had 335,491 records and DDS
had 339,910 records. Both files cover the time period 2014 through 2020, and both
contain the following fields:

138
139
140
141
142

• inmate ID, a unique identifier for each incarcerated individual,

143

• date and time of admission into jail system,

144

• date and time of discharge from jail system,

145

• race of inmate,

146

• gender of inmate,

147

• a code describing the inmate’s status within the justice system, and

148

• a code corresponding to New York state law that specifies the most significant
charge associated with the inmate’s incarceration.
Additionally, DDS provides the age of each inmate at discharge.

Data Reconciliation

152

ADS and DDS provide similar information and have identical columns, with the
exception that DDS includes inmate age at discharge time. Crucially, though, the two
files are not identical. For example, any inmates admitted prior to January 1, 2014 but
discharged afterwards would appear in DDS but not in ADS. Conversely, any inmates
who have been admitted but were not discharged prior to January 1, 2020 would appear
in ADS but not in DDS. Still, beyond these explicable discrepancies, we find: records
that are present in one but not both files; records that are in both files but with some
fields missing data in one or both files; and records that are in both files but with
conflicting information. Additionally, within each data set, we find records that are
near-duplicates but that disagree on a subset of variables. We recognize four categories
of records that must be removed prior to analysis.
(1) Records within ADS for which all information is an exact duplicate of another
record. We remove one such record.

(2) Records within DDS that conflict with other, nearly identical DDS records. These
records contain matching inmate ID and admission date-time information with
conflicting discharge date-time information. We remove 667 such records.
(3) Records for which the discharge date-time is prior to the admission date-time. We
remove one such record each from ADS and DDS.
(4) Records within DDS that conflict with records in ADS. These records contain
matching inmate ID and admissions date-time information and conflicting discharge
date-time information. We remove 11 such records.

After the data reconciliation process, we have 335,478 ADS records and 339,231 DDS
records, accounting for 99.9% of the originally downloaded data. We now accept certain
of these records into our final data set, attempting to match records across the two data
sets when feasible. For matching, we attempt to match on three key identifiers: inmate
ID, admission date-time, and discharge date-time.
Altogether, we accept seven different categories of records into our final data set for
analysis.
(1) Records that match across ADS and DDS based on inmate ID, admission date-time,
and discharge date-time. There are 277,117 such records.
(2) Records in ADS with a missing discharge date-time that can be recovered via
matching with DDS based in inmate ID and admission date-time. There are 51,285 such
records.
(3) Records in DDS that are absent from ADS because their admission date-time is
prior to 2014. There are 10,723 such records.
(4) Records in DDS that are absent from ADS, but that have admission date-time 2014
or later. There are 106 such records. We presume that their absence from ADS is a
clerical error.
(5) Records in ADS that are missing from DDS despite having discharge date-time
information. There are 27 such records. We presume their absence from DDS is a
clerical error.
(6) Records in ADS that have missing discharge date-time information and that are
found in the Current Inmates data set. There are 4,814 such records.

(7) Records in the Current Inmates data set that are found neither in ADS nor DDS.
There are 253 such records.
At this stage, our data set has 344,325 records. This data set has no internal
conflicts on key identifiers (inmate ID, admission date-time, and discharge date-time)
and it has complete information in those variables except for cases of missing discharge
date-times for currently incarcerated individuals. In Data Cleaning (below) we will
remove a small number of additional records.

Though we have eliminated conflicts on key matching variables, there remain conflicts
on demographic variables. For instance, there may be an inmate who is designated as
Black in ADS and Asian in DDS. Another inmate may be listed as male for one record
in ADS and may have missing gender information for another records in ADS.
We resolve race demographics in the following manner. For each unique inmate ID,
we examine all data that we have for that inmate’s race, both (potentially) across
multiple incarceration episodes and (potentially) across data gleaned from ADS and
DDS. In cases of disagreement, we remove all missing values and take the mode of the
remaining data as the individual’s race. If there is no unique mode either because all
data were missing or because there is a tie in the data, we assign NA to represent
missing data. This procedure resolves race information for 13,621 records corresponding
to 10,941 individuals. We perform a similar procedure for gender, which resolves 938
records for 801 individuals. It is possible that demographic discrepancies are due to
changes in identity, for example, gender presentation for transgender individuals.
However, because the data does not explicitly address transgender identity, we follow
the procedure above. In Discussion and Conclusions, we make recommendations for
improving data practices to make them more humane and to mitigate erasure of
transgender individuals and other marginalized groups.
We also resolve discrepancies in inmate status code and top charge code. Here,
comparisons across records for the same individual are not relevant, as each
incarceration episode may differ on these variables. However, for records that were
matched across ADS and DDS, these variables should, but do not always, match. For
each inconsistency, we check whether it is due to missing information or to conflicting
information. For missing information, we simply accept the information that we do
have. For direct conflicts, we set the final value of the variable to be NA to represent
missing data. Overall, we find 21,299 explicit conflicts for inmate status code and 3,269
for top charge code.
Next, we clean inmate age at discharge. The distribution has a long tail of inmate
age up to 93 years old, and then a gap, with 45 inmates recorded with ages 117 or older.
For these 45 records, we set age to NA. For the remaining data, there are inconsistencies
in age information among many individuals with multiple incarcerations. For example,
an inmate discharged in 2014 may show an age of 43 at time of discharge, and may
show an age of 44 for an incarceration that took place from 2019 - 2020. To remedy
these inconsistencies, we examine all individuals with multiple incarcerations and we
impose three different sets of changes.
(1) For 220,299 records comprising 63,552 individuals, there is inconsistent age data and
so we compute a theoretical birth date that minimizes the error between them. For
these individuals, adjusted age differs from the original raw value by, on average, less
than one year.
(2) For 422 records comprising 420 individuals, age data is missing. We recover it by
using the same process as in (1) to compute a theoretical birth date from records that
do have age data and come from the same individuals.

(3) For 13,147 records comprising 2,111 individuals, we attempt to apply the same
computation described above. For each of these individuals, age adjusts by over five
years for at least one record. We assume the age data is corrupt and set it to NA for all
records.
We also examine the date-time of admission and date-time of discharge to create a
derived variable, the duration of incarceration. For current inmates, we use the
date-time of data acquisition instead of the date-time of discharge, since the latter does
not exist. There are four cases we deal with.
(1) For 108 records, the duration of incarceration exceeds five years. Because the city
corrections system is for short-term incarceration, we presume these records contain
clerical errors in date-time of admission and/or discharge. Without accurate knowledge
of admission/discharge information, we cannot analyze these records and so we exclude
them.
(2) For 64 records, discharge occurs on the day prior to admission. We assume these are
clerical errors, and we modify the discharge date-time to be 11:59 p.m. on the day of
admission. For these records we count the duration of incarceration as one-half day.
(3) For 2218 records, discharge occurs before admission but on the same day. Similar to
the case above, we modify the discharge time to be 11:59 and count the duration of the
incarceration as one-half day.
(4) For the remaining 341,935 records, we subtract the date of discharge from the date
of admission to obtain the duration of incarceration in days.

Our final data set is available at http://bit.ly/qside-nyc-jail-data. It comprises
344,217 incarceration records in the New York City jail system for inmates admitted
and/or discharged from 2014 through 2020. We now enumerate the fields in the data set
and provide some contextual and summary information about them.
Inmate ID. As mentioned previously, inmate ID is a unique identifier. There are
163,077 inmate IDs in our data, indicating multiple incarcerations for some individuals.
The median number of incarceration episodes is one and the mean is just over two.
Race. Perhaps surprisingly, in the ADS and DDS raw data that we download from the
city’s data portal, the only values for race are Asian, Black, and Unknown, which we
code as NA. The data disallows meaningful analysis of race. We discuss this issue
further in Discussion and Conclusions. We find that 1.5% of incarceration episodes are
known to be associated with an Asian inmate and 54.0% with a Black inmate. The
remaining 44.5% of incarceration episodes are associated with inmates of unknown race
(which could include Asian and Black).
Gender. The city codes inmate gender as binary. We find that 9.0% of incarceration
episodes are associated with female inmates and 90.8% with male inmates. The
remaining 0.2% of episodes have missing gender information. The median number of
incarcerations is one for both males and for females, and the mean number is 1.8 for
females and 2.2 for males. In Discussion and Conclusions, we make several
recommendations for inclusive practices pertaining to gender data.
Age at discharge. We have age at discharge for 94.7% of records in our data set.
Excluding records for ongoing incarcerations (which have no discharge date), we have
age for 96.1% of our data. The mean age is 37 years old.
Admission date-time. The corrections system records the inmate’s date and time of
admission. All records in our data set have an admission date-time.

Discharge date-time. The corrections system records the inmate’s date and time of
discharge. For 1.5% of records in our data set, there is no discharge date-time. These
records represent incarcerations that were ongoing at the time of data collection.
Duration. As mentioned, we derive this variable by taking the difference in discharge
and admission dates for each episode. For the 25,522 records for which admission and
discharge are on the same day, we count the duration as one-half day. Overall, the mean
is 64 days, with 66 days for males and 45 days for females.
Status. Associated with each incarceration episode is a code that describes the
inmate’s status within the corrections system. Explanations of each status code can be
found in [24].
Top charge code, description and class. For each incarceration episode, the
city’s data provides the legal charge that is most responsible for the incarceration. This
charge appears as an alphanumeric code that refers to a section of state law. From this
charge code, we extract from the New York state laws website [25] a description of the
crime and the class of the charge. For example, one top charge code in the data set is
140.20. This crime is “burglary in the third degree” and state law specifies that it is a
Class D Felony.
Scrape date. We have recorded the date we downloaded raw data, namely, January 9,
2021 for all records.
It is worth contrasting our data set with another resource, the Vera Institute for
Justice’s JailVizNYC [24], an online, public-facing, interactive tool for exploring New
York City jail data. We conjecture that JailVizNYC is built by scraping the city’s Daily
Inmates in Custody data set each day. As a result, this data set is richer and more
granular than the one we have constructed. Unfortunately, the Vera Institute’s
historical data only covers the time period June 25, 2017 through November 11, 2019,
and thus cannot be used for studying incarceration during COVID. Additionally, it
appears that the underlying data set is not readily available to the public. However, for
our study, [24] was useful as a validation of our own data for the dates that are shared
between the two.

We now use our compiled data set to examine four questions related to New York City’s
discharge policies during COVID. First, we examine the historical data for the the jail
population and find an unprecedented decrease during the week of March 23 – 29, 2020.
It was at the start of this week that Mayor de Blasio made his public statement ordering
the discharge of inmates who were at a high risk of contracting COVID-19, and were at
a low risk of reoffending. We then study duration of incarceration, age at discharge
time, and likelihood of readmission to jail for inmates discharged during this week. For
the remainder of this paper, we refer to March 23 – 29 (of any year) as our focus week.
We begin by visualizing the historical jail population, shown in Fig 1A. Several
features stand out. First, there are visible dips in the population centered around the
end of calendar years. Unfortunately, the data does not provide an explanation for these
dips. They could be related to decreases in crime at the ends of calendar years,
decreases in policing during those same times, and/or result from a systematic data
keeping error. Additionally, there is fluctuation on a weekly scale. We see local maxima
in the jail population on Sundays. By examining the daily data for discharge and
admission separately (rather than the total population, as shown in the figure) we find
that both admissions and discharges decrease on weekends, but that discharges decrease
more than admissions do, driving an overall increase in jail population.

Weekly net change in jail population
Fig 1. Jail population in New York City, 2014 – 2020. (A) Inmate population over time. (B) Histogram of weekly
net change in jail population. The week of March 23 – 29, 2020 is when Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered discharge of inmates at
high risk of contracting COVID-19 and at low risk of reoffending.

There are two other notable features of the time series. First, in late 2019 there was
a substantial decline in jail population. This decline is coincident with the start of the
retroactive application of the state’s bail reform law. As discussed in Introduction, this
reform led to the discharge of approximately 1,700 pretrial detainees who had been in
jail precisely because they were unable to pay bail. Not long thereafter, there is an even
steeper decline in jail population. As we mentioned above, this decline is during the
focus week in 2020 and was catalyzed by de Blasio’s policy announcement.
To better understand the extent of this decline, we calculate the weekly net change
in jail population, that is, admissions minus discharges for our entire data set. Fig 1B
provides a histogram of these weekly net changes. Notably, there is a single outlier: the
focus week in 2020, that is, March 23 – 29. During this week, the jail population
decreased by 662 inmates. This decrease is nearly 300 inmates larger than the next
most substantial decrease, and is driven by both a decrease in admissions and an
increase in discharges.
Because we are interested in Mayor de Blasio’s stated discharge policy, we now
analyze the 819 inmates discharged during the focus week, March 23 – 29. To control
for seasonal effects, we compare these to the 6,725 discharges in our data occurring
during the focus week of all prior years, back to 2014. We will probe how certain factors
in our data set are associated (or not) with discharge. Even though our data set
contains information about inmate status, we do not analyze it because of the large
amount of missing data. Restricting attention to the focus week for 2014 - 2019, status

code is missing for 5.5% of incarceration episodes, but for 2020, it is missing for 43.6%.
Similarly, though we have some information about the top charge associated with each
incarceration, it is missing for 67.7% of the records across the entire data set, so we do
not analyze it. The factors that we are able to analyze are duration of incarceration,
inmate age at discharge time, and inmate reoffense.

We provide results about duration of incarceration in Fig 2. Panel A shows a histogram
over the entire data set. Because the frequencies in the histogram vary over many
orders of magnitude, we use a pseudo-log scale on the vertical. Panel B shows, via box
plots, the distributions of duration, separated by year. The distribution for 2020
appears to have a substantially higher median value as compared to other years. To test
whether duration was statistically significantly different in 2020, we perform a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. More specifically, we test the null hypothesis that the
cumulative distribution function (CDF) of durations of incarceration for inmates
discharged during the focus week, 2020 does not lie below that of the CDF for those
discharged during the focus week in all previous years (combined). Panel C displays the
two CDFs. The value of the KS test statistic is D = 0.98 with p-value p < 0.001.
Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the CDF of durations for
2020 lies below and to the right of the CDF for previous years. Stated crudely, we
conclude that for March 23 – 29 discharges, the inmates discharged in 2020 tended to
have incarcerations of longer duration than inmates in previous years.

plots, the distributions of age, separated by year. To test whether age was statistically

hypothesis that the CDF of age of inmates discharged during the focus week, 2020 does
not lie below that of the CDF for those discharged the same week in all other years
(combined). Panel C displays the two CDFs. The value of the KS test statistic is
D = 0.068 with p-value p < 0.01. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude
that the CDF of age for 2020 lies below and to the right of the CDF for previous years.
Stated crudely, we conclude that for March 23 – 29 discharges, the inmates discharged
in 2020 tended to be older. The difference is, as stated, statistically significant. The
magnitude of the difference is modest, with the median value for 2020 approximately
two years older than for previous years.

As we have mentioned, during the focus week of 2020, Mayor de Blasio ordered the
release of inmates who were at low risk of reoffending. Because there is no definitive
way to know whether an individual has committed a crime, we take readmission to jail
as a proxy for reoffense and study readmission within our data. Specifically, to
investigate whether de Blasio’s policy was followed, we fit a logistic regression model for
a dichotomous outcome variable of whether or not an inmate discharged during a given
calendar year was readmitted in the same calendar year.
In designing the regression, there are several important factors to keep in mind.
First, the reason we use a calendar year time horizon is to make a fair comparison
between years. The target of our study is March 23 – 29, 2020, and our data set has

coverage only through the end of 2020. Second, and relatedly, inmates released later in
the year would of course have less time to commit a crime and be apprehended than
those released earlier in the year. To control for this effect, we add an indicator fixed
effect for release during our focus week, March 23 – 29. Third, it is possible that the
year of release could have an impact on readmission. For example, perhaps 2020 had
lower readmission rates overall than other years, not just for those inmates released
during our focus week. To control for this, we add an indicator fixed effect for release
during 2020. Finally, our target of estimation is the effect on readmission of being
released specifically during March 23 – 29, 2020. Thus, we also include an interaction
effect between the two aforementioned fixed effects. This allows us to estimate the

impact of release during the focus week of 2020, while controlling both for the marginal
effects of our focus week and of 2020.
We show the results of our logistic regression estimation on Table 1. Key results are
as follows. First, we observe an estimate of 0.473 associated with the focus week
covariate. This positive and statistically significant effect suggests a positive association
between release during March 23 – 29 and the log-odds of readmission in the same
calendar year, controlling for all other variables in the model. Second, we observe an
estimate of −0.542 associated with the 2020 covariate. This negative estimate is also
statistically significant, and suggests a negative association between release during 2020
and the log-odds of readmission in the same calendar year, controlling for all other

variables in the model. Lastly, our statistically significant estimate of −0.260 for the
interaction effect suggests that, after controlling for the marginal effects of release
during the focus week and release during 2020, release specifically during March 23 – 29,
2020 has a negative association with the log-odds of readmission. In other words, all
else being equal, our model would predict a lower probability of reoffense for an
individual released during our focus week in 2020.

Policy Simulation

436

We have shown that during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, New York City
chose to release inmates, and especially the longest-serving inmates, from its jail system.
With such releases now demonstrated to be feasible, and keeping in mind that the city’s
jail system is intended for short-term incarceration, we now examine how the jail
population would have looked over the past six years had caps in incarceration been in
place. Specifically, we perform policy experiments in which we choose a maximum
allowed duration of incarceration D days for various values of D. For each D, we find
all incarceration records in our data set for which the duration of incarceration was
longer than D days. For these records, we artificially reduce the duration of
incarceration to D and we edit the discharge dates to be commensurate. Fig 4
summarizes our analysis of these modified data sets.
Fig 4A shows time series of the jail population for several values of the incarceration
cap D. The top curve, labeled “No limit,” is the actual jail population. The remaining
curves comprise results for caps ranging from one week through one year. Because we
are interested in the resources used by the jail system for long-term incarceration,
panel B summarizes the effect of different incarceration caps D from one day through
five years, broken down by inmate status. For each value of D, we construct a time
series like those in panel A and add the total population each day from 2014 through
2020, yielding a total number of days of incarceration. Mathematically, this is similar to
taking the integral of the time series. In terms of policy, the calculation measures the
number of person-days of incarceration spent by the system. Very crudely, this count
would be the same as the number of lunches served to inmates. We show the horizontal
axis on a log scale so that we can consider a large range of D, and as a result, the curve
appears sigmoidal. It is striking that if incarcerations were limited to one year, the
system would experience a 15% decrease in person-days of incarceration. With a cap of
D = 100 days, the reduction would be over 50%.
Additionally, by examining the colored areas, we can see the effect of the
incarceration cap on different inmate statuses. As the cap becomes more stringent

(A) Time series of the jail population for several values of the incarceration cap D. The top curve (pink) represents the true
historical jail population. (B) Effect of incarceration cap on the jail system as a function of D, which we place on a log axis.
If incarcerations were limited to one year, the system would experience a 15% decrease in person-days of incarceration. With
a cap of D = 100 days, the reduction would be over 50%. Additionally, as the cap becomes more stringent (smaller), we see a
drastic reduction in the number of pre-trial detainees and a substantial proportional decrease for sentenced state-ready
inmates. Status codes are as follows: CS = City Sentenced; CSP = City Sentenced with VP Warrant; DE = Detainee;
DEP = Detainee Parole Violator; DNS = Detainee Newly Sentenced to State Time; DPV = Detainee Technical Parole
Violator; SCO = State Prisoner Court Order; SSR = Sentenced State Ready; NA = Missing Data.

(smaller), there is a drastic reduction in the number of pre-trial detainees (DE). This
result may be of particular interest to bail reform advocates, who, as we have discussed
above, have called for policies that reduce the incarceration of this group. Additionally,
the greatest proportional decrease is for sentenced state-ready inmates (SSR), that is,
inmates who have been convicted of a crime and are awaiting transfer to a long-term

state prison. This result suggests that expediting the transfer process may play an
outsized role in reducing person-days of jail incarceration.

Data Recommendations

(1) The city makes historical data available only for admission and discharge into the
jail system, as opposed to a daily roster of inmates. To know the jail population on any
specific past date requires data merging and reconciliation operations that are quite
involved, as we described at length in Methods.
Recommendation: There should be a single public data set that reports incarceration
records. New records should be appended and pushed to the city’s data portal every day.
(2) DDS and ADS classify inmate race/ethnicity as either Black, Asian, or Unknown.
Assuming accuracy of the data provided, this means that the only aggregate
racial/ethnic demographics that can be known are lower bounds on the number of
incarceration episodes for Black and Asian individuals. The picture of the jail’s
historical racial/ethnic demographics is, therefore, extremely imprecise. By contrast, the
Daily Inmates in Custody data set classifies inmate race/ethnicity as “A,” “B,” “I,” “O,”
“U,” or “W.” While no data dictionary is provided to explain the meaning of this coding,
we assume that “W,” indicates White, and therefore the data would at least allow one
to differentiate White inmates from others, although as mentioned above, the historical
data is not archived. Overall, the aforementioned limitations preclude research into
racial equity.
Recommendation: In the data file recommended in (1), race/ethnicity should be
reported as a coded categorical variable chosen by the inmate. The coding should use a
rich set of categories that, while necessarily incomplete, strive to maintain inmate
dignity. One plausible set of categories might be: Asian, Black, Latinx, Middle Eastern,
Native American/Alaska Native, Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian, White, An Identity
Not Listed Here, and Prefer Not to Say. Inmates should be allowed to chose more than
one category in order to allow for multiple identities.
(3) The current coding of gender as binary (male/female) is limiting and inhumane.
Recommendation: Gender should be reported as a coded categorical variable chosen by
the inmate. The coding should use a rich set of categories that, while necessarily
incomplete, strive to maintain inmate dignity and to better describe the full expression
of human gender. In this list of categories, the terms man and woman should replace
male and female, as the latter are generally used to indicate specific biological
characteristics. For a jail system, gender, and not biology, is more appropriate to track.
One plausible set of gender categories might be: Man, Woman, Nonbinary/Gender
Noncomforming, Transgender Man, Transgender Woman, An Identity Not Listed Here,
and Prefer Not to Say.

The accuracy of all of our conclusions is limited by the accuracy of the underlying data.
New York City’s recent efforts to publicize important data on their Open Data Portal
are laudable, but researchers across disciplines from public health to urban planning
have noted the data sets need improvement for complete accuracy and
transparency [26, 27]. We find the same is true with the jail data we use. We now
highlight some challenges of the data, and ways in which New York City’s public jail
data should be improved. Because we are not privy to details about the internal usage
of data within city systems, we do not make recommendations for it. Though internal
and external data issues are inextricably linked, we focus on aspects of the data that
affect the public’s ability to understand incarceration policies and outcomes.

(4) Information about inmate age at discharge is inconsistent, as discussed in Data
Cleaning. That is to say, for many inmates with multiple incarceration episodes, the
difference between discharge dates may be years off from the difference in ages at
discharge. We addressed the inconsistency using a simple error-minimization procedure,
but consistent age data is clearly preferable.
Recommendation: An inmate’s birth date should be recorded in internal data, but not
public-facing data. Public-facing data should provide age at discharge based on the
automatically calculated difference between discharge date and birth date.
(5) As discussed earlier, inmate status code is missing for over 6% of incarceration
episodes. The missing data precludes a public understanding of those inmates’ fate
within the criminal justice system.
Recommendation: Accurate and complete reporting of inmate status code must be
achieved for public transparency. Records with status codes missing in the public data
should be flagged and remediated. The data portal should provide an accompanying
glossary that explains the meaning of all status codes.
(6) The top charge responsible for the inmate’s incarceration is not in a standardized
form. Most charges are denoted by their section and clause in the New York State Penal
Code. However, some inmates have vehicle code violations, which are sometimes (but
not always) denoted with the three-letter abbreviation VTL. These charges were much
less likely to have consistent entries. For example, the violation in Section 511-A of the
vehicle code (facilitating aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle), was coded
different ways in different records in the data, including “VTL 511,” “511(1)(A),”
“511(2)(A),” “VTL 511(3),” “511(3)(A),” “511-A(3),” and “511(3)(I).” Furthermore,
some top charge codes have no clear connection to any written law. For example, nearly
1000 inmates are charged with “000.00.” These sorts of data issues render it difficult or
impossible for the public to know the reasons individuals are being incarcerated, thus
hindering transparency.
Recommendation: Top charge code should be standardized and made a categorical
variable rather than a free-text one. The data portal should provide an accompanying
glossary that explains the meaning of the codes and links to relevant sections of the law.
(7) As discussed in Data Cleaning, the raw data we downloaded contains some
demonstrable and some likely errors in admission and discharge date-time. Suspect
records include those with incarceration durations of many years, and those for which
discharge occurs before admission. In general, these anomalies cast some doubt on the
accuracy of admission and discharge date-time data. Thus, it is difficult for the public
to confidently know for how long individuals are being incarcerated.
Recommendation: It is critical to report admission and discharge date accurately. To
avoid future inaccuracies in these data would likely require amending internal
data-keeping and information technology procedures to which we are not privy.
Nonetheless, addressing the issue should be a top-line priority.

During the week of March 23 – 29, 2020, there was a dramatic and unprecedented
reduction in the New York City jail population. This reduction was substantially larger
than any other one in our data set, which dates back to 2014. Inmates discharged during
this week had much longer durations of incarceration than inmates discharged during
the same week in previous years and were less likely to reoffend. Inmates discharged
during this week were also slightly, although by a statistically significant margin, older.

Early in the week, Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters that his administration would
discharge inmates who were at high risk of contracting COVID-19 and at low risk of
committing future offenses. It seems plausible that inmates at high risk of contracting
COVID-19 would be dramatically older than the inmates discharged during the same
week in previous years. Since release of dramatically older inmates was not borne out in
our data, we speculate that inmates determined to have low risk of reoffending made up
the bulk of discharges, and that these inmates had disproportionately long durations of
incarceration. If this speculation is true, then the de Blasio administration was
successful in assessing risk of reoffense: inmates discharged between March 23 – 29, 2020
were significantly less likely to be readmitted to jail later in the calendar year than
inmates discharged during this week in previous years.
It is striking that the de Blasio administration was able to identify inmates at low
risk of reoffense and was willing to release them. Their success with discharge during
the early stages of COVID-19 makes us wonder why the usual practice is to keep
low-risk inmates incarcerated.
We also conclude from our policy simulation that setting a permanent, mandatory
cap on the duration of incarceration would result in a significant, sustainable reduction
in jail population. Such a cap would also lead to a dramatic reduction in person-days of
incarceration, an important metric in discussions of jail operating costs, since inmates
who stay in jail the longest serve a disproportionate number of the system’s total days.
Finally, caps would substantially reduce the number of person-days of incarceration for
pretrial detainees and the proportion of person-days for sentenced state-ready detainees.
As we discussed in our Introduction, New York put in place bail reform early in
2020, retroactive to November, 2019. As we show in Fig 1A, this reform did indeed
decrease the jail population, but it plateaued around 5,500 inmates, falling short of the
city’s goal of 3,300 inmates by 2026. We conclude that the 2020 bail reform has been
insufficient, on its own, to meet that goal. From our own results, we see that there exist
circumstances under which the city is willing to give early discharge to inmates who
were incarcerated, and hence not affected by the bail reform. In our simulation, we have
shown that a continuation of similar early (capped) discharge policies would allow the
city to meet its goal. In particular, a cap of one year (the purple curve in Fig 1A) would
do so.
We do not comment on the public safety implications of instituting a cap. Criminal
justice advocates [14] and law enforcement officials [28] have ongoing disagreements
regarding whether or not this kind of reduction in jail population will lead to an
increase in crime. We ourselves have only a limited amount of reoffense data for a small
subset of inmates, and so we cannot meaningfully weigh in on this debate.
While we have demonstrated the reduction in incarceration that a cap would achieve,
we cannot comment on the viability of instituting such a cap, either in New York City
or elsewhere. The reason for a long incarceration depends on inmate status, and we will
address three cases.
First, long incarcerations for city-sentenced detainees simply reflect the sentences
given. From March 23 – 29, 2020, our data demonstrate that some of these sentences
were cut short. In general, to reduce person-days of incarceration for this group would
require sentencing reform.
Second, long incarcerations for sentenced state-ready detainees reflect a failure to
efficiently transfer inmates to a long-term incarceration facility. To reduce person-days
of incarceration for this group would likely require more resources and bureaucratic
reform at city, state, and/or federal levels.
Finally, long incarcerations for pretrial detainees like Kalief Browder could be due to:
unjust court rulings that refuse to dismiss a case despite the prosecution’s inability to
produce evidence; bureaucratic errors; delay requests by under-resourced public lawyers;

and a city-wide caseload that overwhelms an insufficient number of city courts. To
shorten the duration of pre-trial detainment beyond what bail reform has achieved
would require bureaucratic reform, allocation of budget to increase the court system’s
capacity, and other resources and systemic changes.
We have now seen that in a time of crisis, the city was able to immediately give early
discharge to a dramatic number of low-risk inmates. This makes us wonder why similar
policies, which target inmates with especially long jail incarcerations, are not
permanently in place. Additional bail reform, sentencing reform, better articulation
between city jail and other justice systems, bureaucratic reform within the city’s own
system, and increased budget to reduce long incarcerations among pretrial inmates are
all changes that would allow the city to fulfill its commitment to reducing jail
population.
