Abstract
Background
COVID-19 has caused almost unprecedented change across health, education, the economy
and social interaction. It is widely understood that the existing mechanisms which shape
health inequalities have resulted in COVID-19 outcomes following this same, familiar, pattern.
Our aim was to estimate inequalities in the population health impact of COVID-19 in Scotland,
measured by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2020. These were scaled against prepandemic inequalities in DALYs combined across all causes, derived from the Scottish
Burden of Disease (SBoD) study.
Methods
National deaths and daily case data were input into the European Burden of Disease Network
consensus model to estimate DALYs. Total Years of Life Lost (YLL) were estimated for each
area-based deprivation quintile of the Scottish population. Years Lived with Disability were
proportionately distributed to deprivation quintiles, based on YLL estimates. Inequalities were
measured by: the range, Relative Index of Inequality (RII), Slope Index of Inequality (SII), and
attributable DALYs were estimated by using the least deprived quintile as a reference.
Overall, and inequalities in, COVID-19 DALYs were scaled against pre-pandemic estimates of
inequalities across all causes from the SBoD study.
Results
Marked inequalities were observed across several measures. The SII was 2,048–2,289
COVID-19 DALYs per 100,000 population. The RII was 1.16, meaning that the rate in the
most deprived areas was around 58% higher than the mean population rate, with 40% of
COVID-19 DALYs attributed to differences in area-based deprivation. Overall DALYs due to
COVID-19 ranged from 7–20% of the annual pre-pandemic impact of inequalities in health
loss combined across all causes.
Conclusion
The substantial population health impact of COVID-19 in Scotland was not shared equally
across areas experiencing different levels of deprivation. The extent of inequality due to
COVID-19 was similar to averting all annual DALYs due to diabetes. In the wider context of
population health loss, overall ill-health and mortality due to COVID-19 was, at most, a fifth of
the annual population health loss due to inequalities in multiple deprivation. Implementing
effective policy interventions to reduce health inequalities must be at the forefront of plans to
recover and improve population health.

Background
COVID-19 has caused almost unprecedented change across health, education, the economy
and in social interaction. In Scotland in 2020, COVID-19 has been estimated to have had the
second largest population health impact across all individual causes of disease and injury,
with 98% of its impact attributed to premature mortality [1]. Prior to the pandemic, we knew
that inequalities in health have persisted, even during periods of larger gains in population
health [2]. It is widely understood that the existing mechanisms which shape health
inequalities have resulted in COVID-19 outcomes following this same, familiar, pattern [3,4].
As a response to mitigate the potential for COVID-19 impacting those that were already
vulnerable to adverse COVID-19 outcomes, the Scottish Government developed shielding
guidance towards the end of March 2020 [5]. The guidance mainly involved prolonged indoor
social isolation, designed to protect those that were likely at greatest risk of COVID-19
infection and mortality. This involved shielding based on an age criteria, given that elderly
people were at the greatest threat, and shielding of those with pre-existing underlying health
conditions [6].
Published statistics have since underlined that not only was COVID-19 infection more
common in Scotland’s most deprived areas, but the most deprived areas in Scotland tended
to have higher rates of COVID-19 mortality [7,8]. Commentators have since highlighted how
the impact of COVID-19 infection has been magnified through a legacy of systemic and
intersectional inequality, giving rise to a syndemic in some countries [9,10].
The extent of health inequalities for individual health conditions in Scotland is well known.
Causes such as: drug use disorders; liver cirrhosis; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;
and, suicide, exhibit the largest inequalities in health outcomes [11,12]. On the other hand,
there are health conditions where there are very little, to no, inequalities, such is the case for:
sensory conditions; headaches; and some musculoskeletal conditions [13]. Through using
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to proportionately weight the impact of ill-health from
morbidity, and premature mortality, due to individual causes of disease and injury, we can
comprehensively, and comparably, examine the extent of inequalities across all-causes [14].
The aim of this paper was to estimate inequalities in the population health impact of COVID19 in Scotland, measured by DALYs in 2020. These were then scaled against the prepandemic inequalities in all-cause DALYs, derived from the Scottish Burden of Disease
(SBoD) study, to characterise differences between the absolute and relative impacts.

Methods
Data
Individual-level data on provisional death registrations were sourced from National Records of
Scotland (NRS) [15]. COVID-19 deaths were defined using the ICD-10 codes U07.1 or U07.2,
based on guidance from the World Health Organization [16]. Deaths were included in this
study if the date of death was during 2020, with the first death occurring in mid-March 2020.
The dataset was generated on 25th February 2021, to allow additional time to capture the
later registrations of some deaths occurring towards the end of 2020. Each individual death
record had a postcode assigned. We matched each individual death to the area-based
Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) 2020 reference file, which is an area-based
proxy of socioeconomic status, to group deaths based on socioeconomic quintile [17]. SIMD
uses seven domains to examine the extent of area deprivation: income; employment;
education; health; access to services; crime; and, housing. The inclusion of a health domain
introduces a circular logic when assessing health outcomes, but previous studies have
evidenced that it doesn’t make any practical difference.
Data on the number of Years Lived with Disability (YLD) directly due to COVID-19 infection
were sourced through the SBoD study [1]. These are described in further detail elsewhere
[1,18,19]. Mid-year population estimates by deprivation quintile were sourced from NRS [20].

3

The most recent pre-pandemic estimates of the number of DALYs due to all-causes in 2018
by deprivation quintile were sourced from the SBoD study [21].
Analyses
The estimation of DALYs directly due to COVID-19 were based on the consensus model and
methods outlined by the European Burden of Disease Network and the European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control [22]. We used two different definitions of mortality, which
were used to estimate the upper and lower limits of DALYs. These were based on COVID-19
as the underlying cause of death (COVID-19 cause-specific), with the other definition being
based on COVID-19 as an underlying or contributing cause of death (COVID-19 related). A
small number of deaths that did not have a postcode, and as such did not match to a
deprivation quintile (N=17 (0.2%) for COVID-19 related deaths). We proportionately
redistributed this small number of deaths to deprivation quintiles based on the observed
proportions of death by age group and deprivation quintile.
Mortality counts were aggregated by five-year age-group to calculate Years of Life Lost to
premature mortality (YLL), with the under-5 year age-group split into under 1 year and 1 to 4
years, and the upper open-ended age-group set at 95 years and above. YLL was estimated
by multiplying the number of deaths in each age-group by the age conditional life expectancy
defined by the Global Burden of Disease 2019 reference life table [23]. The units of analyses
were deprivation quintiles, which represent ordered fifths of the population, grouped on the
basis of their overall SIMD score. The Scottish national estimate of YLD was proportionately
redistributed to deprivation quintiles, based on our observed distribution of YLL across
deprivation quintiles. YLD and YLL were summed to estimate DALYs.
Rates of COVID-19 DALYs per 100,000 population were estimated for each deprivation
quintile. We estimated inequalities using several measures. Absolute and relative range
differences in rates were estimated between the most and least deprived quintiles.
Additionally, inequalities were measured using the Relative Index of Inequality (RII) and Slope
Index of Inequality (SII). This involved fitting a linear regression to the ranked area deprivation
quintiles and the DALY values. The RII was estimated by dividing the SII rate by the overall
Scottish rate [24]. DALYs attributable to area deprivation were estimated by using the least
deprived quintile as the reference group and summing all DALYs in excess of this reference
across the other four deprivation quintiles, and are presented as numbers and in percentage
terms [25]. Overall COVID-19 DALYs were described alongside inequalities in pre-pandemic
all-cause DALYs, based on comparisons between absolute and relative measures of
inequalities, and attributable DALYs. Additionally, COVID-19 DALYs were scaled against the
extent of all-cause DALYs due to inequality in area deprivation.
All results were presented as a range (where appropriate), using a sensitivity based on YLL
estimates using cause-specific and COVID-19 related deaths. All COVID-19 estimates
presented were for calendar year 2020, in Scotland.

Results
Inequalities in the population impact of COVID-19
The overall rate of COVID-19 DALYs (N= 96,519–108,243) in Scotland, 2020, was estimated
to be between 1,767 and 1,981 per 100,000 population (Figure 1). The rate was the lowest in
the least deprived quintile (1,054 to 1,189) and increased with greater deprivation, with the
highest rates observed in the most deprived quintile (2,748 to 3,067).

Comparisons between COVID-19 and all-cause inequalities
There were marked differences in the rate of COVID-19 DALYs by area deprivation,
confirmed across all measures of inequality (Table 1). The absolute difference in DALYs
between the most and least deprived areas was between 1,694 and 1,878 per 100,000
population. The relative difference in DALYs between the most and least deprived areas was
2.6, indicating that DALYs were 2.6 times higher in our most, compared to least, deprived
areas. The RII was 1.16, which when divided by 0.5 and expressed as a percentage means
that the rate in the most deprived areas was 58% higher than the mean rate of the population.
The difference between the most and least deprived areas, measured by SII, was 2,048 to
2,289 DALYs per 100,000. DALYs attributable to differences in area deprivation accounted for
40% of total COVID-19 DALYs (N=38,925–43,284). Thus, inequalities in COVID-19 DALYs
were higher than observed for all-causes pre-pandemic, as observed through differences
using the relative, and percentage measures. COVID-19 has thus increased overall
inequalities in DALYs across all measures of inequality.

Comparing the rate of overall COVID-19 DALYs with inequalities in pre-pandemic all-cause
DALYs yielded several insights. The overall rate of COVID-19 DALYs was 9–10% of the rate
of DALYs for pre-pandemic inequality across all-causes, measured through the absolute rate
difference. When the SII was used to measure the rate of absolute inequality, this dropped to
7–8%. However, when comparisons were made between overall COVID-19 DALYs and the
number of DALYs attributable to area deprivation, it increased to 18–20%.

Discussion
Summary
COVID-19 has had a substantial impact on the population health in Scotland in 2020,
however the impact was not shared equally across areas experiencing different levels of
deprivation. This result was confirmed across all measures of inequality. There was a twoand-a-half fold difference in the rate of COVID-19 DALYs between the most and least
deprived areas of Scotland. Generally, relative inequalities due to COVID-19 were greater
than the inequalities in the overall pre-pandemic burden of disease. This is consistent with the
idea that the population health impact of COVID-19 infection is largely due to mortality, as
inequalities in mortality outcomes have been previously shown to be much larger than
inequalities in ill-health due to morbidity [13]. Furthermore, if the rate of COVID-19 DALYs
observed in our least deprived areas had been observed in all other areas, 40% of DALYs
could potentially have been averted. In terms of absolute impact, this would be equivalent to
averting all DALYs due to diabetes in 2018 [1]. However, the overall impact of COVID-19 in
Scotland in 2020 was, at most, a fifth of the annual pre-pandemic impact of inequalities in
health loss, a result which ranged from 7% to 20%, depending on which measure of inequality
was used.
Our findings, support the idea that there would be a high proportion of DALYs that are
attributable to prior exposure to metabolic (such as obesity) and behavioural (such as tobacco
smoking) risks [6,26]. The prevalence of such risks factors are socially patterned, as are our
findings, which underscore that preventative action to improve, and reduce inequalities, in
population health is a matter of urgency, particularly given the recent slowdown of gains, and
widening of inequalities, in mortality [27,28].
Strengths and limitations
Our analyses assumed that the distribution of YLD by area deprivation was the same as the
proportional distribution of YLL. We believe this to be a rational choice, given that total YLD is
estimated to be around 2% of DALYs, and that the pattern of cases which have been
observed have indicated similar patterns by deprivation [29]. Area deprivation is however
known to underestimate the true inequalities experienced by socioeconomic position because
only a proportion of the most deprived individuals live in deprived areas (and vice versa).
Thus, the inequalities and attributable fractions for individual socioeconomic position would be
likely to be higher than those reported here [30].
A major strength of our study is that DALYs capture the full impact of ill-health and mortality,
across all causes of disease and injury. For example, comparisons that are made only using
mortality data are useful, but ignore the consequences that people suffer due to living with
health conditions. This means that our comparisons are among the most equitable, and
comprehensive, that can be made.
When estimating YLL we used an aspirational approach, which assigns higher values of life
expectancy than those currently achieved in Scotland [31]. Not only is it important for
assessing the burden of disease overall in Scotland, but retaining this approach is important
from an inequalities perspective. This ensures that we highlight the extent of inequalities
relative to what could be achieved, rather than just what has recently been estimated for
Scotland.

Implications for policy and research
Progress of the COVID-19 vaccination programme (as at early spring 2021) has indicated
high uptake, across all area-based deprivation groups. For elderly groups, uptake was lower
in the more deprived areas. There was a higher uptake of vaccination in the most deprived
areas for people aged 50 to 64, although this was likely reflective of a higher proportion of
clinically vulnerably patients in these groups being invited first [32]. Continuation of efforts to
reduce inequalities in uptake, particularly amongst the elderly, will be an important tool in
preventing adverse outcomes overall, and inequalities by socioeconomic position.
Previous work has indicated the potential scale of several early pandemic mortality scenarios,
relative to inequality-related death in Scotland [33]. Our findings are consistent with the main
messages from this, and further provide an up-to-date assessment of the 2020 impact which
indicates that although COVID-19 infection has had a major population impact, its impact was
substantially lower than the impact of pre-pandemic health inequalities across all-cause
morbidity and mortality. The rapid, and substantial, resources deployed to tackle COVID-19
has demonstrated the potential for investment to tackle major public health issues in a swift
manner. Although the absolute impact on population health through socioeconomic
inequalities is at least five-fold of the impact of direct COVID-19 impact in Scotland, the policy
response to COVID-19 has undoubtedly averted and mitigated from a much worse scenario,
including the further exacerbation of health inequalities. During the COVID-19 pandemic there
has been an increased public interest in accessing and understanding population health
information. Framing population health issues relative to COVID-19 offer opportunities to
retain, and improve, public- and policy-level empowerment over tackling public health issues
which existed prior to COVID-19, and present major future challenges.
There are major current, and future, challenges related to the wider pandemic harms due to
disruptions to vital services, worsening of individual, and collective, social and economic
circumstances [3]. In addition to this, there will also be clinically-related harms from long
COVID-19 and indirect harms from suffering from infection, such as increased vulnerability
and frailty. Reports during 2020 have indicated major concerns across several areas of
health, relating to the increasing occurrence, and severity, of disease [34-36]. The SBoD
study will continue to monitor mortality and morbidity to assess how short- and longer-term
changes are proportionately impacting population health.

Conclusion
COVID-19 has had a substantial impact on the population health in Scotland in 2020,
however the impact was not shared equally across areas experiencing different levels of
deprivation. The extent of inequality in population health loss was proportionate to averting all
annual DALYs due to diabetes. In the wider context of population health loss, overall ill-health
and mortality due to COVID-19 was at most a fifth of the annual population health loss due to
inequalities in multiple deprivation. Implementing effective policy interventions to reduce these
unfair, and unjust, health inequalities due to COVID-19, and all other causes, must be at the
forefront of plans to recover and improve population health. Pursuing this will not only improve
the lives of people in Scotland, but will ensure increased preparedness against any direct or
indirect harms from future disasters of epidemics [37,38].
