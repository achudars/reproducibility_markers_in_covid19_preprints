"3" "Abstract"
"4" "Recent  theoretical  and empirical  urban planning  studies suggest that  the availability  of  daily amenities , such as shopping stores, health care  units , education services, ph a rmacies,  within a 1 5-20 - minute walking distance can   keep  daily life flux  and   also   bring  physical  activities  to   individuals coping with the movement limitations of  lockdowns during   the COVID-19 Pandemic .   This paper focuses on the relationship between neighborhood walkability and the changing walking behavior of  514  individuals during the se lockdown s .   The spatial context of this relationship highlights three main  urban design  aspects of   the  novel and innovative urban  neighborhood   planning:   walkable access ,  spatial proximity ,  and social cohesion. This  study  demonstrates  how  restrictions imposed by  the COVID-19 Pandemic  affect the walking behavio rs  of the  individuals,  within 15-20 minute walkable  and non-walkable neighborhoods located in   different socio-economic   geographies from  American, European, Asian,  Western Pacific , African ,  and Eastern  Mediterranean  cities.   The   discussion  section of the methodology  is supported  by a  survey questionnaire conducted in  2 4  disparate neighborhoods.   Our data obtained from survey questionnaires is indicating that lockdown restrictions during the  P andemic influenced the walking  purpose.  Research findings  also  reflect limitations during the  P andemic complicate individuals ’  requiring access to amenities in urban neighborhoods. With a nod to future studies on this topic, this paper proposes a basic framework as well as a thematic analysis with superimposed polar matrix charts."

"6" "Introduction"
"7" "One security measure to control the spread of COVID-19 infection has been the imposition of movement limitations in the form of partial and total lockdowns. However, as a consequence, a sizeable percentage of individuals from different  socio-economic  geographies have been forced to spend the  majority of their time at home.   The  difficulties they experienced in this form  of isolation  prompted the necessity for novel and innovative urban planning  approaches that  recognized the need  for neighborhoods  to pursue their community life while enforcing strict movement limitations."
"8" "In response, cities like Paris, Melbourne, and Shanghai are proposing innovative policies that focus on spatial proximity-based planning that prioritizes amenity-rich neighborhoods where services fulfilling daily needs are located within (a mile or 1.61 kilometers or 5280 feet) 15 to 20-minute walking distances (Chiang et al., 2017; Moreno et al., 2021; Talen, 2010; Weng et al., 2019). Around the world, several conceptual approaches such as the 15-minute community life circle and the 20-minute neighborhood planning practice, which were accelerated during the COVID-19 Pandemic, have now captured the attention of planners, politicians, and human geographers (Choi et al., 2021;  Guida  &  Carpentieri , 2021; Li et al., 2021; Salama, 2020; Whittle, 2020).   The need for rethinking urban neighborhoods  emerges  where distance-based urban planning  approaches of  the  New Urbanism  can be reconciled with time-based  Chrono-urbanism  innovative concepts   that  underline access to  necessary urban amenities  during the crises.  Th e survey questionnaire used to  describe how walking behaviors are affected by the movement limitations of  the COVID-19 Pandemic  in 15-20 minute walkable and non-15-20 minute   walkable  24  neighborhoods located in  Africa, Europe,  Western Pacific ,  South East Asia , East  Mediterranean ,  and  North  and South  America s  from  different  socio-economic   backgrounds.  Th is  study  explains  the relationship between the  individuals’  walking behavior and movement restrictions of the different neighborhoods. At this point ,  the specific purposes of the research are to:"
"9" "• Ascertain factors behind the individual’s purpose of walking and place preferences which are forming their walking behaviors before and during  the COVID-19 Pandemic ,"
"10" "• Provide insightful suggestions for planning walkable neighborhoods that can be both resilient and socially coherent during any given crisis similar to  the COVID-19 Pandemic ."
"11" "The paper’s  originality lies  in its emphasis on three aspects of neighborhood planning for coping with a crisis such as  the COVID-19 Pandemic : wal kable access ,  spatial proximity ,  a nd  social cohesion.  These aspects not only can provide an alternative vision for neighborhood planning approaches but also  may shed an alternative light on understanding the relationship between the spatial context of the walking behavior of individuals and  the  planning  practice of  15-20 - minute walkable neighborhoods."
"12" "Movement  r estrictions of  the COVID-19 Pandemic"
"13" "Cities and neighborhoods around the world have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic, causing them to face new challenges. Local and national government administrations announced mandatory lockdowns or strongly worded protocols to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus in their populations.  These movement restrictions most administrations implemented were time-based and age-based mandatory lockdowns and included mandates to wear masks and maintain social distance as 6 feet or 2 meters  (CDC, 2021) . Adoption of these measures became a “new normal” for almost all individuals living in different cities and neighborhoods  (Sandford & Euronews, 2020; WHO, 2021) .  Duration and coverage of lockdowns differed depending on the population and number of cases in the communities.   In Russia and Turkey, age-based lockdowns gave scheduled access to daily needs services for the vulnerable age groups, such as seniors 65 and over and children under age 16. Time-based lockdowns limited all mobility options for a certain time or day(s) long  (CDC, 2021; Fuller et al., 2021; The Oxford Martin School, 2021; WHO, 2021) ."
"14" "In Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia, and India partial and distance-based lockdowns, limited access to all parks, schools, workplaces, and places of worship in public places, except emergency health units, cut all physical access to essential urban functions such as work  (offices, plazas, ateliers, factories,  and  etc.); commerce (retail, whole sell stores, banks, shopping malls, markets, etc.); education (schools, libraries, museums, etc.); entertainment centers (theaters, cinema, music halls, public centers, etc.) for days, weekends, or months   (Haaretz, 2021; Mehtar et al., 2020; Schonfeld, 2020) .  In  the USA  movement restrictions such as  personal  isolation and  stay home orders a re preferred as they are expected to prevent individuals from further waves of infections during the pandemic  (CDC, 2021; The Oxford Martin School, 2021) .  Currently, while individuals in communities worldwide are struggling with the current regional economic crisis, terror, and administrative challenges, the COVID-19 Pandemic has worsened already poor living conditions and affected walking behavior  (Askitas et al., 2020; Kupferschmidt & Cohen, 2020; Sibley et al., 2020) .  The movement restrictions of the pandemic exposed the unpreparedness of many urban neighborhoods in their current planning layouts    (Allam & Jones, 2020; Badland et al., 2014; Ritchie, 2020) . To address this challenge in creating secure communities that can access neighborhood amenities, novel urban planning focuses upon walking, which is not only an easily available but also a healthful form of physical activity. In particular, walkability; how  a walkable  neighborhood has recently become one of the most significant indicators for urban planning   (Dovey & Pafka, 2020; Weng et al., 2019; Yep et al., 2019) .  Developments in neighborhood planning have emphasized the principle of walkability and motivating walking behavior as crucial for environm ental and social sustainability."
"15" "The  spatial  context of walking behavior  of individuals  and walkability"
"16" "Walkability and walking behavior are two concepts that  not only interrelate but also difficult to separately measure   and define   (Ewing & Cervero, 2010; Forsyth, 2020) .   Developments in  urban  neighborhood planning  practices of New Urbanism  have emphasized the principle of walkability and motivating walking behavior as crucial for environmental and social sustainability  (CNU, 2020; Hutabarat Lo, 2009; Talen & Koschinsky, 2014) .  (Badland et al., 2014; Barton, 2020; Leinberger, 2007) .  The measure of the walkability of a neighborhood defines urban design qualities related to approaches which include the subjective perception and  physical  dimensions of walkability  (Clemente et al., 2005; Forsyth, 2020; Szerszynski & Urry, 2006) .  Effective measurements of  neighbourhood  walkability have been validated by showing  destination-based metric qualities which depend on the tools such as checklists, social surveys, as well as indices, and multi-layered spatial analysis. The measure of the walkability of a  neighbourhood  defines urban design qualities related to approaches which include the subjective perception and objective dimensions of walkability   (Clemente et al., 2005; Forsyth, 2020; Szerszynski & Urry, 2006) .   The  spatial  context of walking behavior extends to the physical and social qualities which define how walkable is a neighborhood. The basic qualities of walking behavior are known as the “five Ds”: diversity; density; design; destination, and distance    (Julie Campoli, 2012; Ewing & Handy, 2009) .  Diversity : relates to the mixed land use and texture of destinations which also indicate with preferred the walking place of individuals  (Ewing & Handy, 2009) .   Urban amenities already located in the neighborhood and how close they are to each other, such as having housing next to retail stores alongside commercial ones, also define the context of spatial diversity. Mixed land use neighborhoods that have residential areas, comingled with commercial zones and entertainment centers, help sustain an economically vibrant social structure. Having a broad mix of daily needs services near housing units can also provide individuals with the opportunities to work close to where they reside.   Density:  usually refers to population (in persons per acre or hectare, square mile, or square kilometer) and housing (dwelling units per acre or hectare)   (Julie Campoli, 2012; Ewing & Handy, 2009) . Population density is sometimes combined with a count of the number of jobs in a given area to calculate an activity density    (Ewing & Cervero, 2010) .  Campoli argues that the quality of walkability is not a physical density itself, but the richness of a place that influences peoples ’  walking behavior   (Julie Campoli, 2012; Hutabarat Lo, 2009) .   Living close to urban amenities influences the walking behavior of individuals. The availability of these services for meeting daily needs while lessening the reliance on automobiles, also increases the motivation for individuals to walk in their neighborhood  (Ewing & Cervero, 2010) .   Therefore ,  u rban neighborhood planning can arrange for daily need services whether walking is the best choice for the individuals or not.  Design : includes street network attributes within a neighborhood where vehicular-dependent mobility needs to be incorporated . T his can require specific design approaches  (Julie Campoli, 2012; Ewing & Handy, 2009) .   Design measures on a neighborhood include physical features such as block size, intersections, sidewalk quality, street width, size or  number  of trees, and availability of pedestrian-friendly services. Campoli’s discussion of walkable street design argues for the importance of lowering vehicular dependency; connecting streets through a grid system give more choice to pedestrians and encourage walking and also helps improving design approaches focusing on re-planning neighborhoods has become desert of urban amenities   (Julie Campoli, 2012) .   Destination accessibility:  measures the distance between essential urban services in neighborhoods. In some studies, regional accessibility is simply the distance to the central business district   (Leinberger, 2007; Weng et al., 2019) .  In others,  regional accessibility is the number of jobs or other attractions that are reachable within a given travel time, which tends to be highest at central locations and lowest at peripheral ones   (J. Campoli et al., 2001; Handy et al., 2005) .   One confounding factor, which has been the subject of many studies, is residential self-selection: people who prefer to drive tend to move towards low-density suburbs, whereas people who prefer to walk, cycle or use transit tend to move towards higher density urban areas, better served by public transport.  Distance:   is usually measured as an average of the shortest walking distance between the essential urban functions and the nearest commuter stops (train, bus, subway etc.)   (J. Campoli et al., 2001; Handy et al., 2005) .  Alternatively, it may be measured as the availability of the space where  all the essential urban services are accessible without consuming automotive energy and individual  time   (Ewing & Cervero, 2010; Salingaros, 2003) .   The five Ds make the biggest impact when they are planned for in an urban neighborhood as these factors increase cohesion as well. In a location in which a great diversity of urban amenities  exists;  this design motivates individuals to walk in their neighborhoods with greater frequency.   The availability of urban amenities within walkable distance relies on urban design qualities which engage in the well-developed tradition of neighborhood planning."
"17" "Relationship between walking behavior  of individuals  and  lockdowns  of  the  COVID-19  P andemic"
"18" "The restrictions on internal movement during the pandemic establish a drastic drop in community walking mobility while demand to access daily needs services within a walkable distance has increased   (Apple Data, 2021; Euronews, 2020) .   This indicates that  neighborhoods  located in different geographies, the pandemic has significant impact on mobility trends of  communities .   For neighborhoods with vehicular-dependent mobility, it was thought that access to daily urban amenities before the pandemic was well connected with each other   (Johnson, 2002; Perry, 2020) .  Since movement limitations have restricted access to urban amenities, the availability of these daily needs services within a walkable distance became crucial.  The Table 1 below highlights cities in different geographies which have been diversely affected due to the impact of movement restrictions on mobility  trends during the pandemic.  According ly,  summary of most COVID-19 cases reported cities in W HO (World Health  Organization )  regions as Americas, Europe, South-East Asia, Western Pacific, Africa and Eastern Mediterranean and movement restrictions according to GCDL (between January 1   2020 and March 15   2021) and changing in routing requests (since January 13.2020) the most drastic drop as 27% is in Sao Paulo in Brazil and increase is 26% in Jakarta in Indonesia  (Apple Data, 2021; The Oxford Martin School, 2021; WHO, 2021) .  This change in focus from distance based to time - based access to urban amenities, prompted the need for novel and innovative urban planning approaches in neighborhoods, allowing individuals to pursue social and physical activities such as walking behavior while enforcing movement restrictions. However, in order to highlight the relationship between neighborhoods and the changes  in  walking behavior of individuals under movement limitations of the COVID-19 Pandemic, an additional approach is needed. This paper intends to offer such an open discussion with a possible approach of 15-20 minute s  walkable neighborhood concept."

"20" "The concept of 15-20 minute s  walkable neighborhood"
"21" "The  common planning tradition  between  the  1 940s and 1950s to design compact and pedestrian - friendly communities for American cities was the idea of the “neighborhood unit ” . At that time, Perry suggested that urban planning should be based on systematically improvable design layouts which focused on creating pedestrian - friendly neighborhoods. According to his approach, each neighborhood unit should contain physical layouts of building blocks and streets that bring all urban facilities within a pedestrian friendly environment, including; an elementary school; small parks and playgrounds; small stores such as groceries, hardware stores, and bakeries  (Johnson, 2002; Perry, 2020) .  However ,  the post-WWI Great Depressions   and, much later on, the social movements of the1960s, brought  the concept of the neighborhood unit  under attack for supporting social segregation and creating physical connection without social cohesion   (Alexander, 1965; Buttimer, 1980; Lynch, 1981) .  With the respect to these critiques,  Krier  proposed a new concept of “urban quarters” structured on  the  mixed use of housing and integration of daily life facilities within a walkable area of about 0.35 km2 (35 hectares) for 15 thousand people  (Krier, 2014) .  This concept has influenced two new planning practices: the “urban villages” in the UK and  the “new urbanist neighborhood” planning approach in the USA  in   the end of  1980 s   (Carmona et al., 2012) .  Both these concepts require key principles about improving the walkable environment and encouraging individuals to walk in their neighborhoods. The structure of  the  urban village is based on creating self-sufficient or self-contained communities with the help of physically networked neighborhoods without encouraging automobile dependency and increasing the social interactions within a walkable environment   (Szerszynski & Urry, 2006; Tony Aldous, 1992) .  New urbanist neighborhoods such as Self-Contained neighborhoods  support a compact, pedestrian - friendly, mixed use and encourage individuals to take responsibility for their maintenance. According to The Charter of the New Urbanism, the Self-contained neighborhood concept  can  facilitate the independence of individuals who do not prefer driving and also priorities access to daily urban amenities within a walking distance  (CNU, 2020; Duany et al., 2017) .  The pedestrian-friendly and motivating walking features of traditional urban villages and self-contained  neighbourhood  attributes have been adopted in recent walkable  neighbourhood  concepts, to mitigate crises.   In 2016, the Shanghai Master Plan put forward the idea of a “15-minute community life circle” as the basic unit of building community life, providing urban amenities ,  and having public social activity places for individuals within a walking distance, aiming to form a safe, friendly ,  and comfortable community living environment  (Weng et al., 2019; Whittle, 2020) .  According to the principles of the 15 - minute community circle, two inner circles of  5- and 10-minute  walking distances facilitate access to urban amenities. As another example, the city of Melbourne introduced a long-term planning strategy, guiding the way the city would grow and change  (Plan Melbourne, 2017; Shannon et al., 2019) .  Under the “Plan Melbourne” project, the city was reshaped by creating more access to public transport hubs and urban daily services within a 20-minute walk. The Urban planning concept of the 20 - minutes neighborhood aims to create accessible, safe ,  and attractive local areas where people can access most of their everyday needs within a 20 - minute walk that represents an 800m (appx 0, 5 mile) walk from home to a destination and back again. A 10-minute walk to a daily living service and 10 - minutes back home is another alternative."
"22" "Emphasis on time-based planning, either the 15-minute community circle concept or the 20-minute neighborhood project, constitutes an important strategy for  reducing reliance   on automobiles . This design not only lowers transportation costs but also reduces the community’s greenhouse gas emissions  (Moreno et al., 2021) .  In addition, walkable neighborhoods improve public health, help residents save money, and improve access to daily needs. However, the concept of 15-20 minute s  walkable neighborhoods contains practical challenges. The concept may increase the scale of existing problems  in cities  such as Rome and Istanbul with deep historical architectural environments and palimpsest structures in their city layout or cities like Shanghai and New York who possess a high speed business rhythm under the complexity of social, and racial differences   (Weng et al., 2019; Whittle, 2020) .     However, the adaptation of neighborhoods offering the availability of urban amenities according to proximity and  the 15-20 minutes walkable  strategies  not only encourages walking behavior as an important physical and social activity but also provides alternative access to  urban  services during crises.   Therefore, the importance of the time-based neighborhood concepts has grown during the COVID-19 Pandemic  under  partial and total lockdown restrictions as this concept highlights the importance of planning walkable and accessible neighborhoods in order to sustain physical and social cohesion."
"23" "Research design and methodology"
"24" "The methodology of this paper is based on qualitative  research and  supported  by   a case study that mainly focuses on researching the  impact of   the COVID-19 Pandemic  on the walking behavior of  individuals  from different neighborhoods worldwide.  The impact of movement restrictions can vary in term of their durations, limitations, and geographical practicalities. Therefore ,  we collected data relating to the main  research question; “how do COVID-19  P andemic movement restrictions affect the walking behavior of individuals? ”"
"25" "Figure 1 :   present ing  the contextual frame  of the  research,  relationship between movement restrictions of the  P andemic and walking behavior of individuals ."
"26" "The  online survey as well multiple sources like the  WHO , Apple Inc., and Global Change Data Lab of the University of Oxford  ha ve  been used  to  collect mobility  data,  trends ,  and movement restrictions.  T he non-probabilistic sampling technique  was used to define  514 individuals from  the 24  regions  with  highest number of COVID-19 cases  from  American, European, Asian, Western Pacific, African and Eastern Mediterranean cities   according  to  WHO .   The  contextual frame of the  research  ( as is shown in Fig ure   1 )  was designed according to the following  three  main research steps .   Step 1  focuses  on  15-20 minutes  walking  accessibility to daily necessities  in neighborhoods . With respect to the seminal literature of this paper, this step aims t o  explore neighborhood land use  diversity and  accessibility   and identifies the availability of six basic essential urban spatial functions  including  healthcare, living, working, commerce,   education, and entertainment  (Moreno et al., 2021; Weng et al., 2019) .   Step 2,   we recruited online   volunteers  in December 2020; all were self-referred and could complete the survey according to their personal realities about their neighborhoods.   According to the answers, neighborhoods were classified as  15-20 - minute  walkable or non-walkable neighborhoods.   This step  explores  the impact of  the  COVID-19 movement restrictions on individual walking behavior in walkable and non-walkable neighborhoods.  Accordingly ,  we asked  open - ended  three  questions  (1)   “ Why do you need to walk in your neighborhood pre-pandemic and during  the  p a ndemic?”   (2)  “Where do you prefer to walk pre-pandemic and during  the   pandemic?”  (3)   “What do  limit  your walk pre-pandemic and during  the   pandemic? ”   Step 3  examines the opinion of the respondents of urban neighborhoods about how individuals cope with the challenges of the movement restrictions of the pandemic.   Open-ended questions of the survey have been disaggregated with  F requency  A nalysis   Method  and the  percentage of  findings were compared with walking behavior trends before the pandemic and the changing trends during the movement restriction  of  the pandemic. The changes  in the walking behavior of individuals have been shown in superimposed polar matrix charts are proposed and discussed in the following  sections   of the paper."
"27" "Findings"
"28" "The  survey  includes ethnically, politically ,  and spatially diversified  respondents . T he residents  in these  neighborhoods  reflect diversity   in age , income, and educational backgrounds .  Findings of the survey are listed  following to the  research steps of the study.   Accordingly ,   Finding of Step 1 :   t he profile of the respondents indicates that 81.5%  are young (between18-35 years old) and middle age (between 26-50 years old); 93.4%  have some level of education (primary school, high schools and college);  70.6%  are  actively working while 7.4% are not currently working; 11.3%  are students and 10.6% are retired; 76.1% are living in flats (apartments), nursing homes and student dormitories; a majority of respondents,  66% are living with more than 3 people. Survey results  reveal that  75.9% of the respondents have been living in their community longer than 4 or more years; therefore, it is clear that they have spent enough time to be familiar with their neighborhood.  The  superimposed polar matrix chart   shows that  48.8% of individuals can walk to the following six essential urban amenities: healthcare, commerce, education, entertainment, daily   living services, and working  ( Figure  2) . On the other hand, 32.6% of respondents can only access by walking  to  daily   living services and education centers.  Accordingly ,   only 10 of 24 neighborhoods  can be  define d  as  15-20 minute s  walkable  neighborhoods:   Teban  Gardens (Singapore),  Atakent  (Istanbul), Geelong (Melbourne),  Kuntsevo  (Moscow), Mumbai (Maharashtra), Delia (Sicily), Midwood (NYC), Rosario (Santa Fe),  Napoles  (Mexico City),  and  Marbella (Malaga).  On the o t h er hand ,  14 of the 24 neighborhoods can be defined as non 15-20 minute s  walkable neighborhoods;   Fontibon  (Bogota), Western Cape (Cape Town), Lancaster (LA),   El Hana (Casablanca), Pasadena (TX),  Elgoli  ( Tebriz ),  Maalot  ( Tarshiha ),  Al  Fuwayfa  (Benghazi), Bhaktapur (Katmandu),  Nilore  (Islamabad),  Zeitoune  (Gazza),   Sidi  Bu  Said (Carthage) ,  and  Dreamcity  (Erbil). Thereby,   the analysis of the data reveals  two categories of neighborhoods :  individuals living in 15-20 minute s  walkable neighborhoods and  people living in  non-walkable neighborhoods."
"29" "Figure  2 :   present ing   the polar chart of the division of neighborhoods as 15-20 minute s  walkable neighborhoods and non-15-20 minute s  walkable neighborhoods and the descriptive statistics of the respondents."
"30" "Finding of Step 2 :  g iven that 89.1% of lockdowns  as time - limited, age-based ,  and distance - limited  have allowed for physical access to groceries, pharmacies, bakeries or health care units, the walking trend  increased by 82.1% for respondents who indicated their purpose was to go to the nearest groceries, pharmacies ,  and supermarkets  in neighborhoods .  In 15-20-minutes walkable neighborhoods, in pre- P andemic, 76% was going to the nearest transit hub, and  for  during the  P andemic ,   83% of walking purpose was shopping for daily needs. On the other hand, in non-15-20 walkable neighborhoods ,  walking purpose has not changed like shopping for daily needs. As Table 2 shows, the place preference of the respondents has a significant change in the walkable neighborhoods; 63% of walking was in parks and recreational areas  in  pre- P andemic, and %65 of walking was in abandoned areas and empty fields during the  P andemic.  Further , in  the  non-walkable neighborhoods, walking preference has not changed in streets and sidewalks before and during the pandemic."
"31" "Table  2:    present ing  disaggregated data with Frequency Analysis Method and the  percentage of the walking behaviors."
"32" "Finding of Step 3 :   the duration and limitations of mandatory restrictions have a clear influence on changing trends of respondents.  As  Figure   3   shows the highest percentage of the  responses  of the individuals indicates that in 15-20 minute s  walkable neighborhoods , 53 %  of respondents has   no  interest in  walking,  47%   no time for walking  in  the  pre -P andemic.   In non-walkable neighborhoods ,  56% of respondents mention insufficient urban planning, and 44% pointing to the lack of outdoor safety as the most limiting factor of walking in the pre- P andemic.  Additionally, d uring the pandemic, 79% of the respondents both walkable and non-walkable neighborhoods  point  that ongoing health conditions are major barriers to their walking."
"33" "Figure 3:  present ing  change of walking purposes, place preferences, and walking limitations in the  walkable and non- walkable neighborhoods   pre - and  during the  P andemic ."
"34" "Discussion"
"35" "Our data is based on  the questionnaire survey  demonstrating that lockdown restrictions during the  P andemic affected the walking behavior of individuals by changing the purpose of walking and the place preferences for walking.   In literature reviews, walkability and the walking behavior of individuals are examined by looking at their walking purpose, spatial environment, and living conditions   (Bottrell, 2013; Dovey & Pafka, 2020; Forsyth, 2020; Leinberger, 2007; Weng et al., 2019) .  In  this study,   we have focused on three essential aspects of the relationship between walking behaviors and the walkability of neighborhoods under the movement restriction of  the COVID-19 Pandemic . These aspects include the purpose of walking, the preference for places to walk ,  and the aspects of movement limitations of  the COVID-19 Pandemic  lockdowns on walking behavior ."
"36" "In the  walkable neighborhoods where the urban amenities are planned within 15-20 minute s  walkable distances, the main purpose of walking of individuals is to access these radial nodes for physical exercise, basic shopping needs, going to school or health services before the pandemic. However, during the pandemic that purpose focuses mainly on only accessing  daily services  such as supermarkets, pharmacies, and health services.  Further, t he walking purpose under movement  restrictions such  as time - based and age - based lockdowns have created many psychological pressures on individuals that  they never   experienced previously .  Thus, excuses  to break the lockdown rules arise, for example the increased number of people jogging,  and  exercising in the streets as in Delia (Sicily-Italy) .  The reaction of the mayor; “  how come everyone has turned into a running enthusiast! ” briefly depicts the changing psychology as well as well-being of individuals who are under state  of the  imposed mandatory curfews and lockdowns   (Euronews, 2020) .  As another example,  Atakent  (Istanbul) and Rosario (Argentina)  neighborhoods’,   respondents have similar  walking  purposes:   Pre- P andemic  going to the nearest transit hub and during  the  pandemic going for shopping.  This also indicates the influence on changing routing during pandemic, while  walking  under total lockdown in Rosario  has dropped  27%,  in  Atakent  this increases 5% under age - based and time -based   limitations   (The Oxford Martin School, 2021) .  On the other hand , in  non-walkable neighborhoods coping with the  limitations   of the pandemic, the preexisting challenges have become more complex. In geographies where people are trying to survive from ongoing socio-economic and security challenges, pandemic restrictions have brought multifaceted and new problems to these neighborhoods. As an example, in neighborhoods such as   Itaquera  (Brazil),  Fontibon  (Colombia),  Elgoli  (Iran) ,   Maalot  (Israel) , and   Nilore  (Pakistan)  non-15-20 minute s  walkable neighborhoods showcased that their purpose for walking was not affected by  the COVID-19 Pandemic .  Their main purpose for walking continues to be ongoing daily shopping. In t his study , respondents’ walking trends are considered as the meaningful measurement of individuals’ walking behavior before and during the pandemic."
"37" "The place preferences for walking :   individuals  in non-walkable neighborhoods   responded that their most preferred walking places before the pandemic were empty abandoned fields and  sidewalks.  On the other hand, the individuals in walkable neighborhoods responded that their most preferred places for walking were parks, recreation al  and   residential areas between buildings . This difference indicates two different attributes of urban neighborhood planning: proximity and  land use  diversity.   Moreno argues that spatial proximity allows for the transition of individuals between urban amenities such as residential, commercial,  educational centers, health care units ,  and other basic institutions in a reduced timespan.  (Moreno et al., 2021; Whittle, 2020) .   Distance - based  urban planning practices takes  proximity of  basic urban services  by providing individuals with optional use of amenities in their neighborhoods  (Gehl & Svarre, 2013; Urry, 2002) ."
"38" "Regarding individual responses from the neighborhoods, creating socially attractive places like waterfronts, seaside promenades, and board walks-including various cafés and restaurants not only helps increase the sociability of individuals but also  helps  provide a diversity of a healthy mix of residential, commercial, and entertainment components.  In the  non-walkable neighborhoods of Benghazi (Libya), Dream city (Erbil-Iraq), and El Hana (Casablanca), preference in walking between buildings, parks, and recreational places has not changed as it was in Lancaster (LA) and Sidi Bu Said (Carthage) in the pre-pandemic era.  In the walkable neighborhoods like  Kuntsevo  (Moscow) under aged-based and time-based lockdown limitations and Geelong (Melbourne) under stay home order, preferences of individuals have remained similar with non-walkable neighborhoods as walking preference in parks and recreational parks during the pandemic."
"39" "Movement limitations  of walking :  respondents  indicated that movement restrictions of the pandemic have various impacts on neighborhoods regardless of whether they have walkable access to urban amenities within 15-20 minutes or not. During the pandemic, despite the positive effect of the time-based and aged-based lockdowns which prevent virus spread, they also limited walkable access to many social outdoor gatherings, events, and projects. This new normal has also brought alternative ways to deal with the increased physical isolations due to movement limitations of the pandemic.   Digitalization of urban amenities  which provides remote working, education ,  and shopping   w hether in walkable or non-walkable neighborhoods, creates the condition for  the  physical distance .  Movement limitations of the COVID-19 Pandemic have motived individuals to find new ways to maintain either their physical walking behavior or social life and activity in their neighborhoods.  I n  Kuntsevo  (Moscow), Mumbai (India),  Nilore  (Pakistan), and Bhaktapur (Nepal) ,  the public maintained its social fabric by offering volunteer help to those who had to stay home due to partial lockdowns and age-based restrictions such as seniors in ages 65 and over   (Bavel et al., 2020; The Oxford Martin School, 2021) .  In spite of all limitations,  Whyte has noted that movement in the street is the heart of the urban experience and an important criteria in generating social life and activity   (Gemci & Ferah, 2020; Whyte, 1980) ."
"40" "From walkable and non-walkable neighborhoods as two stratified groups of respondents, 68.9% of individuals who were living in walkable neighborhoods expressed the desire for ending lockdowns and uncertainties of restriction end-dates by saying they wish to walk in the streets, hang out with friends in outdoor cafés and restaurants, and be comfortable without considering lockdown time limitations or social distancing. The 79.6% of the individuals who are living in non-walkable neighborhoods indicated that their neighborhood needs urgent re-planning to provide amenities within walking distance and a safe neighborhood environment. This highlights very basic requirements of a post- P andemic neighborhood framework."
"41" "Conclusion"
"42" "This   study   highlights  the  walking behaviors of individuals  in the neighborhoods   before and during the pandemic .    The availability of urban amenities within walking distance has a dominant influence on walking behavior .   Before the pandemic, individuals who are living in walkable neighborhoods used to walk by going to parks, promenades, supermarkets, pharmacies, healthcare units, and entertainment centers located within a 15-20 -minute  walking distance away. However, due to time and age - based lockdowns during the pandemic, individuals were only able to be outdoors in order to  meet their dietary  and healthcare needs.  Further,  limitations  forced  individuals to change their habitual walking locations to street sidewalks, to the nearest residential areas ,  and even some underdeveloped lots.  On the other hand,  in  non-walkable neighborhoods , walking habits  did not significantly alter, it is a consequence of the  urban planning  challenges , such as  a low residential density, poorly connected street networks, and fragmented land use."
"43" "H aving quick access to basic amenities within a  15 - 20-minute  walkable distance is critical, especially under the limited time restrictions of partial lockdowns allowing individuals to be outside only 2-3 hours.  This study  suggest s  that three main aspects should be emphasized for planning walkable neighborhoods: providing walkable access ,  forming spatial proximity ,  sustaining social cohesion."
"44" "Providing walkable access for the basic six essential urban social functions of living, working, commerce, healthcare, education, and entertainment can help support an amenity-rich community circle.  Access to  urban amenities is highly beneficial to promote the quality of walking behaviors  of  individuals. The more individuals walk in a  well   built  environment, the more they reduce their dependence on vehicular mobility .   As such, encouraging walking initiatives should be included in the post-pandemic urban neighborhood planning instructions."
"45" "Forming spatial proximity in planning layouts helps increase the interconnectedness of urban amenities. At this point, planning an urban neighborhood in a compact layout can bring daily services within walking distance, improving remote access of locals, such as remote shopping and remote working, and bringing contextual importance to hyper-local living."
"46" "Sustaining social cohesion and developing viable projects such as community gardens  and  outdoor sporting events where communities can spend more outdoor time together generally helps individuals form closer bonds. Especially during  the COVID-19 Pandemic , communities came together to help one another. It became clear social cohesion and inclusivity w ere  crucial for everyone no matter if they are living in a walkable or non-walkable neighborhood especially during a crisis."
"47" "Therefore ,  the impact of  the COVID-19 Pandemic  movement restrictions on  the  walking behavior of  individuals highlights  how the qualities of distance-based urban planning  need to  be supported with time-based new effective  attributes that  can shape neighborhood planning frameworks . T his research purports to reinforce the notion that walking behavior not only reflects the habit formation of individuals but also helps knit community fabric that can be relied on for social participation and interaction during a crisis."
