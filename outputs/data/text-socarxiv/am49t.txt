Abstract
Background: Containment of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires
the public to change behavior under social distancing mandates. Social media are important
information dissemination platforms that can augment traditional channels communicating
public health recommendations. The objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of
COVID-19 public health messaging on Twitter when delivered by emergency physicians and
containing personal narratives.
Methods: On April 30, 2020, we randomly assigned 2007 U.S. adults to an online survey
using a 2x2 factorial design. Participants rated 1 of 4 simulated Twitter posts varied by
messenger type (emergency physician vs federal official) and content (personal narrative vs
impersonal guidance). Main outcomes were: perceived message effectiveness (35-point
scale); perceived attitude effectiveness (15-point scale); likelihood to share Tweets (7-point
scale); and writing a letter to their governor to continue COVID-19 restrictions (write letter or
none).
Results: The physician/personal message had the strongest effect and significantly improved
all main messaging outcomes except for letter-writing. Unadjusted mean differences between
physician/personal and federal/impersonal were: perceived messaging effectiveness (3.2
[95%CI, 2.4-4.0]); perceived attitude effectiveness (1.3 [95%CI, 0.8-1.7]); likelihood to share
(0.4 [95%CI, 0.15-0.7]). For letter-writing, physician/ personal made no significant impact
compared to federal/ impersonal (odds ratio 1.14 [95%CI, 0.89-1.46]).
Conclusions: Emergency physicians sharing personal narratives on Twitter are perceived to
be more effective at communicating COVID-19 health recommendations compared to federal
officials sharing impersonal guidance.

INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis has exposed the critical need for clearly and
consistently communicating public health guidelines anchored in the best available evidence.
Yet, many voices are competing with public health officials, particularly given that social
media outlets frequently supplant traditional news sources.1 Amid this backdrop, the U.S. has
had higher COVID-19-associated deaths and excess all-cause mortality compared to most
peer countries.2 Despite the alarming rate of viral transmission, the public has not had full
compliance with pandemic guidelines.3,4 Policymakers and public health officials therefore
must be strategic in communicating pandemic-related messages to the public.
Emergency physicians can play a key role in disseminating and amplifying public
health recommendations especially during a crisis.5,6 Emergency departments experienced the
severity of the initial COVID-19 viral surge and were challenged by a rapid response to the
influx of ED patients.7–9 Serving at the front lines of the epidemic, emergency physicians
have played a prominent role as a trusted source in communicating COVID-19 updates and
urging the public to stay home.6,10,11 The effectiveness of public messaging can be influenced
by the credibility of the messenger 12,13 and the content of the message.14 However, there is
little experimental data measuring the effectiveness of public health communication through
personal narrative or by physicians, which has been commonly seen in social media posts
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Therefore, the goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a physician
versus federal official and personal versus impersonal content in delivering COVID-19 public
health recommendations on Twitter, a popular social media platform. We tested the following
hypotheses: 1) Emergency physicians deliver a more effective message than federal officials;

4

2) Personal appeals are more effective than impersonal ones; and 3) The interaction of a
physician messenger with a personal message is synergistic.

METHODS
Study Design and Setting
We conducted a preregistered randomized experiment using simulated Twitter accounts and
posts that randomly manipulated messenger type and message content in a 2 × 2 betweensubject factorial design. We launched the experiment on April 30, 2020, the day the White
House-issued public restriction guidelines were set to expire, transferring decision-making
responsibility on restrictions to state governments.
This trial was approved by the institutional review board at the University of
Michigan. Written informed consent was obtained from participants before participation. This
trial followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)15 guideline with
suggested amendments for reporting nonpharmacologial treatments and factorial trials.16

Participants
We recruited U.S.-based adult participants from Lucid Theorem, a nationally representative
crowdsourced online subject pool that is quota-sampled to match census demographics on
age, gender, race/ethnicity, and region.17 Participants were eligible if ≥18 years old. We
included responses for analysis if ≥80% of study questions were complete. We assessed the
impact of weighting the sample based on demographic characteristics of U.S. adults with
Internet access as reported by the 2017 U.S. Census.18 (eTable 1 and eTable 2) Participants
in Lucid were compensated at a rate comparable to $1 per study. Median time to complete the
study was 11 minutes.

Study Procedures
Participants accessed the online survey (Qualtrics, Provo UT) through their personal
electronic devices and gave consent blinded to the study objectives. They first underwent a
pre-treatment attention assessment with the correct answer embedded in the instruction
stem.19 We randomized participants to 1 of 4 treatment arms with simulated Twitter posts and
they answered a series of questions to measure primary outcomes. This was followed by a
second attention check to recall the messenger’s occupation which was a means of assessing
that participants read the post and had received the intervention. Lastly, participants were
invited to take a stay-at-home pledge, write a letter to their governor, and to answer additional
covariate questions.

Twitter Stimuli and Randomization
We created images of a Twitter account and message for experimental exposures. We used
the same male actor for the emergency physician (dressed in scrubs and a surgical cap) and
the non-physician federal official (business clothes). The background photo was a building
selected to plausibly appear as either a federal building or hospital. We took other Twitter
metrics (date joined, number of accounts followed and followers) from an exemplar
emergency physician Twitter account which were the same across conditions.
For message content, we compared the effect of a personal versus impersonal
message. The personal message was based on “the identifiable victim effect”, that having
more identifiable information about a victim increases caring.20 In contrast, the language for
the impersonal message was used directly from a mass federal communication mailed on
postcards to 130 million U.S. households21 as part of the “President’s Coronavirus Guidelines
for America” and from the White House “Opening up America Again” guidelines.22,23
6

The two messages had approximately the same number of words (personal:61,
impersonal:55) and delivered a similar three-part message: (1) young people are at risk; (2)
public activity restrictions should continue; and (3) continuing restrictions would reduce the
risk of viral resurgence. (Figure 1).
Simple random assignment was accomplished via the randomizer tool in Qualtrics.
Each participant was assigned to 1 of 4 possible treatment arms with equal probability: 498 to
physician/personal (PP); 505 to physician/impersonal (PI); 505 to federal/personal (FP), and
499 to federal/impersonal (FI).

Primary Outcome Measures
To evaluate the effect of messages, we measured (1) perceived message effectiveness
(PME), (2) perceived attitude effectiveness (PAE), and (3) behavioral outcomes: likelihood to
share, write a letter to a governor. The PME scale was intended to measure the message’s
emotional impact, and was adapted from a scale used in the context of smoking cessation
research.24 Participants evaluated the messages as: memorable, grabbed my attention,
powerful, meaningful, and convincing on a 7-point Likert scale “Strongly disagree” to
“Strongly agree” (coded 1-7), summed to a 35-point rating. (Supplement section 5) We
modified the original scale by removing subscale “informative,” due to COVID-19
information saturation. The modified scale demonstrates high reliability (α=.93) and an
eigenvalue of 3.96 accounting for 79.2% of the variance, similar to the original scale
reliability (α=.94) and eigenvalue of 4.22 accounting for 70% of the variance.
The perceived attitude effectiveness (PAE) scale was intended to measure the
message’s effect on attitudes, and was adapted from a scale used in smoking cessation
research.25 Participants evaluated whether the message (1) “Made me concerned about the
health effects of lifting restrictions on public activity”; (2) “Made lifting restrictions less
7

appealing”; (3) “Discourages me from supporting opening America up right now” on a 5point Likert scale, “Not effective at all” to “Extremely effective” (coded 1-5), summed to a
15-point rating. The modified scale demonstrates high reliability (α=.88) and one-factor
dimension that accounted for 81.3% of the variance, similar to the original scale reliability
(α=.93) and a general factor that accounted for 82.6% of the variance.

We measured likelihood to share the Tweet as an estimator of the messages’
behavioral impact. This was measured on a 7-point Likert scale “Extremely unlikely” to
“Extremely likely” (coded 1-7). Self-reported willingness to share social media posts has
previously been correlated with increased sharing in reality.26
Lastly, we asked participants whether they were interested in writing a letter to their
state governor (yes/no). Participants who agreed were provided a free-text response box to
write to the governor (not a form letter) and were truthfully informed we would send this
letter anonymously, which we did via state government online communication forms.
Because of the cognitive effort involved, the letter-writing task is less susceptible to
desirability bias.27

Secondary Outcome Measures
As an exploratory outcome, we asked participants to take a pledge (yes/no) to stay inside to
fight COVID-19. Pledging has been a popular way in the COVID-19 pandemic for concerned
groups to encourage social distancing.28 Prior research indicates that pledging to engage in
prosocial behavior (e.g., voting, environmental protection) has a small but significant effect
on increasing the desired outcome.29

Covariate Measures
We incorporated additional variables in a covariate-adjusted model and to explore
heterogeneous treatment effects using demographic information provided by Lucid (age,
education, race/ethnicity, sex, household income, political party, state), which we
supplemented with survey questions on overall health, marital status, population density,
number in household, employment status, and political ideology. We also collected variables
related to health behaviors, policy positions, and messaging receptiveness: anxiety about
coronavirus, trust in federal officials and physicians,30 economy vs public health trade-off,31
political engagement,32 consumption of media bias via AllSides rankings,33 empathy (using
the empathic concern subscale of the Brief Interpersonal Reactivity Index34), and news
exposure frequency. Finally, we incorporated data on the extent of COVID-19 cases and
restrictions based on the participant’s state of residence (Supplement section 3).

Statistical Analysis
Sample size was determined from a pilot survey with 601 Lucid participants
conducted two weeks prior and not included in the final study. We estimated with 438
participants per treatment arm (N =1752), the minimum detectable effect at 80% power using
a 2-sided hypothesis test (α = .05) is approximately 0.10 standardized units for a bivariate
outcome difference of letter-writing.
The statistical analysis plan was pre-registered prior to data collection through the
Open Science Framework (Supplement Section 9). We compared demographic characteristics
and outcomes across groups by analysis of variance and T-Test for continuous variables and
χ2 test and Z-test of proportions for categorical variables. As recommended for the accurate
reporting of factorial studies,16 we present three major comparisons: (1) 4-level treatment
effects; (2) each factor pooled (messenger and message content); and (3) interaction between

9

factors. Assumptions for each statistical test were evaluated using standard diagnostic tests
and no major violations were found.
We estimated treatment effects using ordinary least-squares linear regression and
logistic regression on the 4-level treatment factor, with federal impersonal as the omitted
reference category. Regression models were covariate-adjusted to maximize the precision of
estimated treatment effects. Covariates were selected by items expected to be associated with
social distancing, then manually backward selected for inclusion based on the strength of the
association with the outcome and Akaike information criterion (AIC) of the model fit:
race/ethnicity, marital status, political party, gender, COVID-19 anxiety, news frequency, and
economy vs public health trade-off. All models were assessed for violations of basic
assumptions and no major violations were found. Participants with missing value for a
variable were included with a missing data indicator for that variable.
We also examined whether subgroups of participants were affected differently by
treatments using generalized random forest, a machine learning algorithm that estimates
treatment effect heterogeneity as a function of each participant’s covariate profile by
nonparametric statistical estimation based on random forests.35 Understanding how
demographics may contribute to different responses to messaging can help in creating tailored
content for specific groups at higher- risk for COVID-19.4 Identifying these groups would
create opportunities for audience segmentation - varying messaging strategies to address
different groups - as demonstrated in climate science communication literature.36 We assessed
the effect heterogeneity specifically for PME because as an emotion-based rapid cognition,
we hypothesized it would be more likely to be influenced by demographic profiles.37 R
version 3.5.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) was used for statistical analyses, and
the grf package was used for Causal Forests.38

RESULTS
Of 2090 participants who entered the survey, 2007 consented, were randomized, and
completed the survey with ≥80% data (eFigure 1). All participants that were randomized
were included in the analysis. Participants’ mean age was 45 years (SD 16.7 years), 51%
(n=1034) were female, 10.6% (n=214) were Black, and 11.6% (n=234) were Hispanic.
Baseline characteristics and covariates were well-balanced across the four treatment arms
(Table 1, eTable 3).
Main Outcomes
For the 4-level treatment results, participants rated PME, PAE and likelihood to share
significantly higher in the physician/personal (PP) condition compared with the
federal/impersonal (FI) condition, with largest effect on PME (Figure 2). Unadjusted
estimated effects of PP versus FI are presented here with outcome means (eTable 4);
remaining comparisons are shown in eTable 5. For the PME 35-point scale outcome, the
means were: PP 28.52 (SD 6.81) versus FI 25.32 (SD 6.95) (difference 3.2 [95%CI, 2.37 to
4.02] p<0.001). For the PAE 15-point scale, the means were: PP 11.02 (SD 3.66) versus FI
9.77 (3.54) (difference 1.26 [95%CI, 0.81 to 1.7] p<0.001). For the likelihood to share 7-point
scale, the means were: PP 4.99 (2.09) vs FI 4.59 (2.13); (difference 0.4 [95%CI, 0.15 to 0.66]
p=0.003). There was no significant difference across treatment arms of letter-writing to the
governor to continue public activity restrictions (odds ratio for PP compared to FI was 1.14
[95%CI, 0.89-1.46]). The proportion letter-writing was 50.6% for PP vs 47.3% for FI
(difference 3.3% [95%CI, -3.1%to 9.7%] p=0.33). There was similarly no significant effect
on the pledge to stay home secondary outcome: mean PP 90.6% vs FI 90.0% p=0.99. As
expected, adjusted means had similar effect estimates with more precise confidence intervals
(eTable 6).
11

The average effects of the messenger and message are presented in eTable 7. The
pooled treatment effect of both personal content and physician messenger had a statistically
significant impact on both PME and PAE. Cohen’s D, a standardized measure of effect size,
is presented here to facilitate comparing across different scales-- 0.2 is considered a small
effect and 0.5 a medium effect.39 The average personal content had a stronger effect compared
to physician messenger for PME (0.40 [95%CI, 0.28 to 0.52] p<0.001 versus 0.25 [95%CI,
0.13 to 0.37] p<0.001) and PAE (0.22 [95%CI, 0.10 to 0.35] p<0.001 versus 0.16 [95%CI,
0.04 to 0.29] p=0.009), respectively. Conversely, personal content did not significantly
increase likelihood to share, while the physician messenger retained a positive effect (0.17
[95%CI, 0.05 to 0.30] p=0.006). We found a negative interaction for PME such that
physicians had an incrementally increased score compared to federal officials when
presenting for the impersonal context, but less so for the personal narrative (-1.18 [95% CI, 2.35 to -0.02]; P=0.045). No significant interactions were found for the other primary
outcomes.

Sensitivity Analysis Attention Check Question
We presented participants with two attention checks. Most participants passed the postoutcome measured manipulation check, correctly selecting the occupation in the Twitter
profile (81.1%, n=1628). Far fewer passed the pre-exposure check in which the correct
answer was hidden within the instruction paragraph (52.1%, n=1046). The groups were
similar in treatment effects but had slightly stronger effects in the groups with higher levels of
attention checks. (eTable 8, eFigure 2)
Treatment Effect Heterogeneity

12

We did not find significant heterogeneity in causal forest-estimated treatment effects of the
personal message on PME. Causal forest was trained on many key variables, and test set
predictions and CIs were assessed (Figure 3). While some patterns visually emerged among
the variables specifically selected for graphical illustration based on hypothesised effect
heterogeneity- political ideology, health status, age, and race/ ethnicity- all individual
confidence intervals overlapped, coinciding with the null global test.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, nationally representative, pre-registered,
randomized experiment to directly estimate the effect of a physician versus federal official
messenger and message content of simulated social media posts on individual perceptions,
attitudes, and behavior. We found that public health messages delivered by physicians and
personal messages elicited stronger emotions, greater changes in attitudes and an increased
willingness to disseminate the message than when federal officials delivered impersonal
messages. We did not observe differences in a stay-at-home pledge (which was near ceiling),
nor in willingness to write a letter to the governor to continue restrictions. These findings
suggest that to emergency physicians sharing personal stories on social media may be more
effective in increasing general adherence to public health guidelines than federal officials
sharing impersonal messages. Complementary communication campaigns are still needed to
augment these recommendations in order to change pandemic related individual behavior.
Our study adds important findings of source effects and messaging content on a nontraditional communication platform during this public health crisis. We demonstrate that
trusted messengers can alter opinions on contentious public policy issues consistent with prior
experiments finding a medical scientist and physician increased support for antimicrobial
resistance policy12 and comparative effectiveness research,13 respectively. The framing of
13

health messages also matters. Similar to identifiable victim effect findings, we found
enhanced emotional and attitudinal impact when the message was to help a single, identifiable
person (i.e. the COVID-19 victim who was a friend) compared to the concept of helping the
many, unidentifiable others.20,40 Moreover, findings of increased public health messaging
effectiveness from personal narratives is also supported by organ donation literature, which
has shown that when viewers are more emotionally involved in a television narrative they
were more likely to become organ donors if the show encouraged donation.41
We also assessed heterogeneous treatment effects to determine if there were distinct
subpopulations which were impacted by the intervention differently, a finding which would
be helpful for tailoring messaging for different groups. Despite a rigorous investigation
harnessing machine learning tools, we found no significant impact of any participant
characteristic, on the extent or direction of the message’s impact, specifically examining
political ideology, health status, age, and race/ ethnicity. Although we did not observe a
differential impact of the emergency physician or federal official on lower income or minority
participants, underserved populations may have lower trust in physicians than those included
in our study,42 and may interact with messages differently from our participants. Future
research should examine how to most effectively communicate with underserved minority
populations hardest hit by the pandemic.
Our results add to a growing body of research investigating the impact of social media
platforms for public health communication. The majority of Twitter users cite it as a news
source,1 presenting an opportunity for health professionals to capitalize on this channel as an
adjunct for reaching a broader segment of the public. Physicians, scientists, and health
providers have played an increasing role on Twitter, using it to share personal
communications43 and engage with the public on health issues.44 Relevant to a pandemic,
14

Twitter has been identified as a tool for efficient information dissemination during emergency
events5 and in public health crises to communicate recommendations.45 Our findings support
the increased use of Twitter by healthcare professionals as a platform to communicate directly
to the public.
While government mandated public activity restrictions and social distancing
recommendations play a key role in preventing the spread of COVID-19, these interventions
will be ineffective if the public is not willing to adhere to them. Social media based public
messaging may help to improve the public’s perception of these measures and thus adherence
to health guidelines. However, during the pandemic, several U.S. healthcare institutions urged
physicians not to make public appeals.46–49 Our findings bolster policies that protect social
media use by scientists and health providers to share public health communications directly to
the public.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the experimental design used a simulated Twitter
message in the context of an online survey. Federal officials may be restricted on what they
can communicate on social media using their official titles, but pilot data for this experiment
showed most participants found the Twitter stimuli believable. It is possible that participants
would react differently if they encountered these messages on the actual social media
platform. However, participant likelihood to share a post has been shown to correlate highly
with action in real life.26 Furthermore, while the effects of user comments on social media
were beyond the scope of this study, prior research has shown that user comments may have
an additive effect on messaging impact,50,51 though whether it will change reader behavior is
unknown. Although we observed an increased willingness to share certain messages, we did
not find differences in pledging to stay home nor writing a letter to the governor to maintain
15

restrictions. It remains unclear if the impact of the messages would translate into real-life
changes in compliance with social distancing measures. Second, though the participant pool
matches U.S. demographics in most regards, our participants had higher educational
attainment and lower proportion of Hispanic origin (approximately 15.4% of U.S. population
with access to internet versus 11% in our study)18 We weighted our sample to account for
educational differences and still did not observe an appreciable impact on treatment effects
(eTable 3). Further supporting generalizability, Lucid participants have exhibited behavioral
experimental results similar to U.S. national probability samples.17 Third, the high levels of
reported anxiety created a likely ceiling effect for our outcomes. For PME, almost half of
participants rated the message at 6 or above on a 7-point scale. Ceiling effects may have
reduced sensitivity to determining differences by treatment, biasing results towards null.
Lastly, we selected white males for the physician and federal official in the study, the most
common demographic for both groups. It is possible that other race and genders of the Twitter
messenger could have influenced subpopulations of this study differently than white males,
however prior patient satisfaction simulation studies did not find differences by physician race
or gender.52

CONCLUSION
Using a rigorous randomized experiment of a simulated Twitter message, we found that an
emergency physician’s Twitter message of a personal story and recommendation related to
COVID-19 increased the attitudinal, emotional and willingness to share measures of impact
compared to a federal official sharing impersonal guidance. These results underscore the
advocacy role for physicians on social media in promoting public health recommendations.
We did not find an impact on letter writing to their governor to support COVID-19

16

restrictions nor pledging to stay home. Future directions should explore the real-world impact
of emergency physician public health tweets on measures of behavior change.

Covariate-adjusted treatment effects from ordinary least squares regression with reference
being the control group, federal impersonal message. Estimates are standardized using
Cohen’s D, which scales outcomes by the pooled standard deviation. A Cohen’s D of 0.2 is
considered a small effect and 0.5 a medium effect.39 (eTable 6 for tabular form). Points are
bounded by 95% CIs. Regression adjusted by covariates: race/ ethnicity, marital (married,
single, other), party, gender, anxiety about COVID-19, news frequency (very frequent,
frequent, other), and economy versus public health trade-off.

considered a small effect and 0.5 a medium effect.39 Omnibus test for heterogeneity53 found no
significant heterogeneity in the effect (p-value 0.26). Political ideology and age selected due
to highest relative variable importance, though not statistically significant. Race/ethnicity and
health status selected due to hypothesized importance, though visually and statistically no

eFigure 1. CONSORT diagram: Recruitment, Randomization and Analysis of
Participants

Study participant flow: 27 participants had incomplete data meaning they entered the study
and did not complete any additional questions after the consent. Those with “incomplete
data” agreed to participate but did not answer further questions beyond the attention check
and thus were not randomized. No subjects were dropped once randomized

2. Survey Weighting eTable1 & eTable 2
We created survey weights to balance the sample demographics to match
estimates for the national population with Internet access using data from the 2017
US Census (the latest date with available national estimates on internet and
demographic data) on age, education, race and ethnicity. (Broadband Adoption and
Computer Use by year, state, demographic characteristics - Data.gov [Internet].
[cited 2020 Nov 19];Available from: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/broadbandadoption-and-computer-use-by-year-state-demographic-characteristics). When
compared to our sample distributions the group characteristics were similar but
varied on education attainment (eTable 1). Our population was more educated than
national estimates, our sample included only 2.3% with no diploma versus 12.3%
and our sample included 56% with college graduates versus 34.1% nationally.
However, when we weighted our sample to account for these educational

29

differences, we still did not observe an appreciable impact on our treatment effects
or confidence intervals (eTable 2) so the analysis is presented unweighted. Raking
method was chosen over more advanced methods as raking has been suggested to
reduce bias nearly as well as more advanced methods, especially with small
sample sizes.1

4. Individual and State-level Covariates
We asked frequency of news exposure and from which news media network to investigate
whether the bias of the individual’s media consumption contributed to a differential impact of
the Twitter message. For the news media bias measure, we created an average media bias
variable from the news media network selected based on rankings created by AllSides.6
Individuals who selected only right or left media sources were coded as “Right Only” or “Left
Only”, while individuals who had sources from a Center source, or if selected Left or Right in
addition to a Center source, were coded as “Mixed”.
Previous research has demonstrated the importance of state of residence as a
contextual variable for understanding Americans’ differences on policy positions.7 In
recognition that where someone lives geographically could influence perspectives on
COVID-19 restrictions, we took into account a number of state-based variables: 1) COVID-19
cases per capita 2) the Cook Partisan Voter Index, a measure of how partisan a state is
based on Democratic or Republican voting data,8 and finally 3) a measure of current state
restrictions on non-essential business closures based on data from the Kaiser Family
Foundation.9
Last, we asked measures of empathy and social media use. In recognition that
participants with varying levels of empathy may be more receptive to a personal story of loss,
we adapted an empathy subscale from a brief form of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index.10
Social media often contributes to the information silos and can exacerbate potential biases in
their news sources.11 Thus, we asked participants to rank the frequency of social media use
and frequency of COVD-19 discussion.

5. Details on Main and Secondary Outcomes
eTable 4
Mean values and percentages across treatment arms are provided in eTable 4. Some
participants wrote a letter to discontinue restrictions, contrary to the persuasive intent of our
message. We only counted letters from participants who wanted to continue restrictions
( those who selected they wanted to continue restrictions in the question directly prior to the
letter writing question). Of note, including all letters, regardless of content to continue or lift
restrictions, did result in differences in proportions participating per arm.

Perceived Attitudinal Effect (PAE)
The original PAE scale is as follows: (1) This message makes me concerned about
the health effects of smoking; (2) This message makes smoking seem unpleasant to me;
(3)This message discourages me from wanting to smoke. Attitudes gauged after briefly
viewed health messages have been found to predict actual ad effectiveness in smoking
cessation research.2,3 As they were adapted from a study on smoking cessation, we
replaced “smoking” with “lifting restrictions” to fit our context. The original scale, referred to
by the authors as the UNC PME Scale, or the effects perception scale used a 5-point Likert
scale from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree” (coded as 1–5), but to decrease
acquiescence response bias4 we asked effectiveness [(1) Not effective at all to (5) Extremely
effective)].5
The original PAE scale had an alpha=.93, and the general factor for PME accounted
for 82.6% of the variance. (Baig SA, Noar SM, Gottfredson NC, Boynton MH, Ribisl KM,
Brewer NT. UNC Perceived Message Effectiveness: Validation of a Brief Scale. Ann Behav
Med [Internet] 2019;53(8):732–42. Available from: http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/abm/kay080)
Analysis of our modified PAE scale showed principal component analysis revealing a
strong one-factor dimension with an eigenvalue of 2.44, accounting for 81.3% of the
variance. Scale reliability was high (Cronbach’s α = 0.88 m = 10.38, SD = 3.55)

Perceived Message Effect (PME)
The original PME scale included the following statements: (1) These ads are worth
remembering; (2) these ads grabbed my attention; (3) these ads are powerful; (4) these ads
are informative; (5) these ads are meaningful; and (6) these ads are convincing. We modified
the scale by removing the subscale on “informative” because of cause of information
saturation on COVID-19. We modified ‘worth remembering’ with ‘memorable’ for clarity.
Additionally we increased from a 5-point Likert to 7-point to capture more detail at the
extremes given the likelihood for ceiling effects.
The original PME scale had the following properties: “The initial factor analysis
yielded a strong one-factor solution with an eigenvalue of 4.22, and factor loadings ranging
from 0.76 to 0.87 across the six items in the scale. All other factor eigenvalues were small
and negative. The total proportion of variance accounted for by this single factor was 70%
and scale reliability was high (Cronbach’s alpha = .94).” (Davis KC, Nonnemaker J, Duke J,
Farrelly MC. Perceived effectiveness of cessation advertisements: the importance of
audience reactions and practical implications for media campaign planning. Health Commun
34

[Internet] 2013;28(5):461–72. Available from:
http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2012.696535)
Analysis of our modified PME scale showed principal component analysis of the
adapted PME scale revealed a strong one-factor dimension with an eigenvalue of 3.96,
accounting for 79.2% of the variance. Scale reliability was high (Cronbach’s α = 0.93 m =
27.2 SD = 6.75)

7. Pooled effects eTable 7
Pooled effects, the average treatment effect across treatment arms, are presented with and
without interaction terms and with and without covariate-adjustment in eTable 7. There was a
significant negative interaction such that the physician did not increase the effect of the
personal message as much as it did for the impersonal message. The other outcome
measures had no significant interaction terms. A similar pattern was seen for PAE. Personal
versus Impersonal was 0.20 (95%CI 0.13 to 0.27;P<0.001) and Physician versus Federal
was 0.11 (95%CI 0.04 to 0.19; P<0.05). For likelihood to share, the Personal message had
no significant impact, 0.06 (95%CI -0.02 to 0.14; P=0.12), while Physician was 0.13 (95%CI
0.05 to 0.20;P<0.05).

8. Attention Check Questions eTable 8 & eFigure 2
Participants were asked two attention checks to gauge levels and different types of attention
to the survey experiment. “Manipulation Check” refers to passing the question that asked
what was the occupation of the Twitter messenger. “Instruction Check” refers to the first
question which asked for the participant to read an instruction paragraph which had the
intended answer embedded in the instructions of selecting a favorite color. For most of the
outcomes, participants who passed both checks demonstrate a stronger treatment effect
than those who “passed last check,” than “all respondents,” the total sample population
inclusive of participants who did not pass either or both attention checks.
Details on the covariate profiles of those who failed the different attention checks are
shown in eTable 8. Briefly, those who passed both attention checks differed from those who
passed by higher news frequency, income, higher proportion of Democrats and Liberals,
older, female, and lower trust in physicians.
Treatment effect estimates were stronger for higher levels of attention as shown both
in eFigure 2. Though the magnitude of the effect was slightly different, most of the
confidence intervals overlap and the direction of the effect is qualitatively similar regardless
of the attention check level.

eFigure 2. Estimated Treatment Effects on Primary Outcomes by Treatment Arm by Levels
of Attention Check Correct

eFigure 2 Note: Covariate-adjusted treatment effects from ordinary least squares regression (and
logistic regression for Write Letter Keeping Restrictions) with control group (simulated federal
impersonal message). Estimates are standardized using Cohen’s D, which scales outcomes by the
pooled SD. A Cohen’s D of 0.2 is considered a small effect and 0.5 a medium effect.12 Regression
adjusted by covariates: race/ ethnicity, marital (married, single, other), party, gender, anxiety about
COVID-19, news frequency (very frequent, frequent, other), and economy versus public health
tradeoff. “Passed Last Check” refers to passing the question that asked what was the occupation of
the Twitter messenger. “Passed Both Checks” refers to passing the occupation check and the first
question which asked for the participant to read a long instruction paragraph which had the intended
answer embedded in the instructions.to the question of what is the participant’s favorite color.

9. Pre-analysis Plan
Available at:
https://osf.io/kabvr/
Based on Aspredicted.org template
1) Have any data been collected for this study already?
No, no data have been collected for this study yet.
2) What's the main question being asked or hypothesis being tested in this study?
Whether the message (personal versus impersonal) and type of messenger (federal
government official versus doctor on the front lines) of a social media post about coronavirus
causes the general public to give a higher rating of a) perceived message effectiveness, b)
perceived attitude effectiveness, c) willingness to like/share the message to their social
network, and d) writing a letter to their state governor to continue coronavirus restrictions.
The null hypothesis being tested is that there are no differences across four treatment arms
that randomize the message and messenger of the social medial post.
3) Describe the key dependent variable(s) specifying how they will be measured.
Main Outcome Measures:
1. Perceived Message Effect:
a. Linear sum of the following five items (i-v) ranked on a scale of (1) Strongly
disagree to (7) Strongly agree
i. This message is memorable
ii. This message grabbed my attention
iii. This message was powerful
iv. This message was meaningful
v. This message was convincing
2. Likelihood to share
a. Scale of (1) Extremely unlikely to (7) Extremely likely
b. If you had a social media account where you posted, how likely would you be
to LIKE or SHARE a post like this with your friends or your followers?
3. Perceived Attitude Effect:
a. Linear sum of the following three items (i-iii) ranked on a scale of (1) Not
effective at all to (5) Extremely effective
b. Thinking about what you just read, rate your opinion on the effectiveness of the
message for these statements:
i. This message made me concerned about the health effects of lifting
restrictions on public activity
ii. This message made lifting restrictions less appealing to me
iii. This message discourages me supporting opening America up right
now
4. Writing a letter to the State governor for continuing restrictions or lifting restrictions
a. Free text written: Yes or No
i. (Exploratory: Length of time spent on free text page/ words written)
44

Secondary Outcome:
1. Pledge to stay home when possible
4) How many and which conditions will participants be assigned to?
Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of four possible conditions, and condition groups
will be forced to equal sample sizes. The conditions assigned involve two interventions: 1)
(messenger: doctor on the front lines vs. federal government official) and 2) (message:
personal vs. impersonal), creating a 2x2 factorial experimental design.
5) Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main question/hypothesis.
We plan to create survey weights to balance the sample demographics to match estimates for
the national population with internet access using data from the Census Bureau’s 2016
American Community Survey (ACS) on sex, age, education, race, Hispanic origin, and region
along with data from the 2010 Census on population density.
Descriptive analysis, linear regression for composite outcome, and ordinal logistic regression
for ordinal outcome (likerts) of the treatment assignment (with Doctor Personal message as
the omitted category) on main and secondary outcomes, with robust standard errors
incorporating sample weights. Descriptive analysis will be reported for secondary outcome.
We plan to conduct the same regression models with adjusted for the following covariates.
These assumptions are drawn from estimates of groups who had varying levels of selfreported social distancing and prior literature on health behavior and thus may be more likely
to experience different exposure effects:
1) Sex (male or female)
2) Political party identification (Republican, Independent, Democrat)
3) Population density (Large city / Town / Rural area)
4) Region
5) Self-rated coronavirus impact -anxiety
6) Marital status
7) Economic versus public health preference
8) Trust in doctors/ federal officials
9) Frequency of exposure to coronavirus news
10) Political engagement
We plan to do a subgroup analysis on the following groups to examine heterogeneity of
treatment effects:
1) Preference for prioritizing measures to help economy versus public health
6) Describe exactly how outliers will be defined and handled, and your precise rule(s) for
excluding observations.
Participants that complete less than 80% of survey questions, or those that do not have
demographic meta-data collected from Lucid, will be analyzed separately from main analysis
but will be reported in supplementary material.

45

We will include two attention checks to assess data quality: a) pre-exposure instructional
check and b) post-outcome manipulation check. These subgroups will be assessed separately
as a robustness check for effect heterogeneity and reported in the supplement. Those who fail
the attention check will be combined into the total sample if there is no evidence of
heterogeneity.
7) How many observations will be collected or what will determine sample size? No need to
justify decision, but be precise about exactly how the number will be determined.
We will collect 2000 in total for a target of 0.80 power to estimate a Minimum Detectable
Effect (MDE) of 0.2 standard units (Cohen’s d) assuming equal variances for the primary
outcome variable of letter writing based on pilot data of a variation of this study.
8) Anything else you would like to pre-register? (e.g., secondary analyses, variables collected
for exploratory purposes, unusual analyses planned?)
Exploratory analysis
We also plan to conduct exploratory analyses of treatment effect heterogeneity beyond the
previously stated variables using RandomForest with multiple comparison considerations.
We will conduct an exploratory structural equation modeling mediation analysis to explain
the effect of our treatment on our main outcomes through effects on our covariates.

Survey instrument

consent We’re doing a study to learn more about coronavirus messaging. You must be 18 or
older to participate. We expect that the survey may take about 10-15 minutes to complete. In
the study, you will view a social media post about the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and
then you will then be asked to answer some questions about the message, yourself and your
views.
Answering this survey is voluntary. You don’t have to answer it if you’d rather not. You can
skip any questions that you don’t want to answer, whatever the reason, and you don’t have
to tell us why. It’s possible that some of the questions may make you feel uncomfortable. If a
question makes you uncomfortable, you can just skip it and go to the next question.
Answering our survey won’t benefit you directly. We hope what we learn will help other
people in the future. To keep your information confidential, your survey responses will be
completely anonymous. No one, including members of our study team, will know which
subjects gave which answers as we are not asking you to disclose any individually
identifiable information. If you have any questions about this study, you can contact the
research team at this email address hum00179706@gmail.com If you would like to
participate, simply check the "I agree to participate" box below, then click the ">>" blue button

Written by Dr. Kevin Miller, an Emergency doctor at ABEM General Hospital: "My best
friend of 20 years just died from COVID-19. Now he's gone, leaving behind his wife and 2
kids. My whole body feels numb. Heartbroken....I hear people are talking about opening up
America. We MUST continue restrictions or this will come back even worse than it is now.”
