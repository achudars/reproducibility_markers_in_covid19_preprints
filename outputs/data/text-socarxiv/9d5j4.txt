Abstract

ro

Background

-p

Although the COVID-19 pandemic has led to worsening mental health outcomes throughout the

re

Canadian population, its effects have been more acute among already marginalized groups,

lP

including people with disabilities and chronic health conditions. This paper examines how

ur
na

heightened fears of contracting the virus, financial impacts, and social isolation contribute to
declining mental health among this already vulnerable group.
Objective/Hypothesis

Jo

This paper investigates how increases in anxiety, stress, and despair are associated with concerns
about getting infected, COVID-19-induced financial hardship, and increased social isolation as a
result of adhering to protective measures among people with disabilities and chronic health
conditions.
Methods
This study uses original national quota-based online survey data (n=1,027) collected in June
2020 from people with disabilities and chronic health conditions. Three logistic regression
models investigate the relationship between COVID-19's effects on finances, concerns about

1

contracting the virus, changes in loneliness and belonging, and measures taken to combat the
spread of COVID-19 and reports of increased anxiety, stress, and despair, net of covariates.
Results
Models show that increased anxiety, stress, and despair were associated with negative financial
effects of COVID-19, greater concerns about contracting COVID-19, increased loneliness, and
decreased feelings of belonging. Net of other covariates, increased measures taken to combat

of

COVID-19 was not significantly associated with mental health outcomes.

Introduction

Since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic in March 2020, the
virus has infected tens of millions, killing over two million worldwide. Concerned about
contracting the virus, while also navigating work, finances, and family life during these unusual
times, individuals are feeling the emotional toll of the pandemic with evidence already showing

of

large negative effects on mental health 1, 2. According to an April 2020 national Angus Reid

ro

public opinion poll, over half of Canadians have experienced declining mental health since the

-p

pandemic began, with many individuals feeling worried (44%) and anxious (41%).1 These

re

effects, however, will not be felt equally across groups.

lP

The pandemic has made ever more salient the ways in which already marginalized groups

ur
na

are disproportionately affected by health crises. Research on the social determinants of health
demonstrates how certain groups are more at risk of contracting disease because of how gender,
race, class, and disability determine their position in the social structure 3, 4. With increased

Jo

susceptibility to COVID-19, people with disabilities and chronic health conditions have been
especially affected by the pandemic. Questions remain, however, about how COVID-19 has
contributed to mental health struggles among people with disabilities and chronic health
conditions and how potential increases in anxiety, stress, and despair vary with deteriorating
financial situations and social isolation brought on by the pandemic.
Disability includes diverse groups of individuals with different and often multiple
functional limitations. Two-thirds of people with disabilities report having two or more types of
disabilities and one-third report four or more in the 2017 Canadian Survey on Disability5.

Considering chronic health conditions sheds further light on comorbidity. People with disabilities
are more likely to experience other chronic health conditions which, in the context of the
coronavirus pandemic, creates additional obstacles, contributing to deteriorating mental health.
As of 2017, 6.2 million Canadian adults (22%) reported one or more disabilities 5, and
25.5% of Canadians had been diagnosed with hypertension, 8.8% with diabetes, 11.6% with
asthma, 10.3% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 7.3% with cancer 6. People with

of

physical, emotional, cognitive, sensory, and independent living-related functional limitations are

ro

less likely to access health services and are more likely to experience unmet health needs in

-p

virtually all nations, contributing to greater health disparities 7, 8. People with disabilities,

re

especially those with intellectual and developmental disabilities, are also more likely to develop

lP

complex health needs and are less likely to receive preventative care 9.

ur
na

People with disabilities and chronic health conditions disproportionately struggle with
physical and mental health challenges that are exacerbated by structural and attitudinal barriers,
which make overall health status a more salient aspect of concern in daily life. They are at higher

Jo

risk of contracting the coronavirus precisely because of these pre-existing or secondary health
conditions 10, 11. They are feeling the immediate impacts of the virus and measures meant to
mitigate its adverse health and economic effects, and they will experience long-term social,
economic, and health disadvantages throughout the recovery and beyond. All of this contributes
to greater anxiety, stress, and despair; yet, these effects will not be uniformly felt among
individuals within this diverse group. We expect that these mental health outcomes will further
vary based on individuals’ concerns about contracting COVID-19, experiences of social
isolation, ability to comply with social distancing measures, and broader financial situations.

4

Unsurprisingly, individuals who are already concerned about their physical and mental
health report a heightened sense of worry during health pandemics. Worry refers to “an attempt
to engage in mental problem-solving to deal with an issue whose outcome is uncertain but likely
negative or can be conceived as an apprehensive expectation about real-life concerns such as
health, relations, finances, work, and school” 12. Consequently, worry about being infected by
COVID-19 has been an important factor contributing to poor mental health outcomes.

of

Pandemic aside, people with disabilities and chronic health conditions are already more

ro

likely than other groups to experience social isolation and multiple forms of low social

-p

connectedness 13. Made worse by the health crisis, social distancing measures and quarantines

re

are further linked to feelings of social isolation and to negative physical and mental health

lP

outcomes 1, 14, 15.

Additionally, many people with disabilities struggle to comply with protective measures,

ur
na

such as physical distancing, effective handwashing, or mask wearing 7, 10, 16. Throughout much of
the pandemic, public policies have remained oblivious to the negative impacts of these measures

Jo

on vulnerable groups, including individuals with respiratory issues, individuals who experience
debilitating panic attacks, people on the autism spectrum, and people who rely on lip-reading to
effectively communicate. Additionally, while many nursing homes became COVID-19 “hot
spots,” people with disabilities who live independently in their communities are facing
disruptions to services offered by care workers feeling uneasy about entering people’s homes.2
Finally, mental health status is also affected by economic insecurity. People with
disabilities are already among the most economically marginalized groups in society with low
employment rates. Although employed individuals directly affected by COVID-19 are able to

make use of income supports like the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (or CERB), many
people with disabilities and chronic health conditions are unable to access such a benefit. Those
looking for work in early-2020 suddenly found a labor market with 50 percent fewer vacancies
19

. Remaining unemployed, they are living off relatively meagre provincial disability benefits

with little federal government support during the pandemic.
When people with disabilities and chronic health conditions do work, they are usually in

of

more precarious jobs, earning low wages 17. People with disabilities are concentrated in retail and

ro

food-related service sector jobs, sectors most impacted by the pandemic 17, 23, 24. These sectors

-p

are less likely to provide opportunities to work from home, increasing exposure to the virus.

re

Alternatively, with the possible exception of “essential workers,” many workers have been let go

lP

or are working with reduced income. Others, about 40% of the Canadian labor force primarily in
white-collar jobs, are now working from home full time25 posing a variety of obstacles when it

ur
na

comes to stress due to rising work-life imbalances 26. Consequently, work disruptions, changing
work conditions, and financial turmoil have adverse effects on households, social relationships,

Jo

and health and mental health outcomes 27.

Low employment earnings contribute to economic insecurity, but people with disabilities
and chronic health conditions also face broader obstacles in accumulating assets. Most
Canadians with disabilities and chronic health conditions rely on provincial disability supports
with stringent income thresholds discouraging work as they face additional living and healthcare
costs 18. This means that compared to the rest of the population, most people with disabilities and
chronic health conditions have less money saved to weather financial storms sparked by
exogenous shocks like health crises.

6

Without a doubt, the economic crisis brought on by COVID-19 has disproportionately
affected already disadvantaged groups whether in terms of temporary or permanent layoffs,
continued unemployment, or increased economic insecurity. Using data from an original national
quota-based online survey (n=1,027), this study examines three mental health outcomes related
to anxiety, stress, and despair among people with disabilities and chronic health conditions
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on previous research, we hypothesize that: (1)

of

individuals who have experienced direct financial losses due to COVID-19 will report larger

ro

increases in anxiety, stress, and despair; (2) individuals who report greater concerns about

-p

contracting COVID-19 will report larger increases in anxiety, stress, and despair; (3)

re

individuals who have experienced more social isolation, measured as increases in loneliness and

lP

decreases in belonging, will report larger increases in anxiety, stress, and despair; and that (4)

ur
na

individuals who take more measures to combat COVID-19 will report larger increases in

Jo

anxiety, stress, and despair.

Methods
Data
The sample was obtained from a quota-based online survey administered from June 11 to
June 22, 2020.3 Data collection occurred just as many cities and provinces across Canada were
beginning to end their “lockdowns” and “open up” their economies.4 Participants were recruited
by Qualtrics, an internet-based survey research company that uses paid panels of respondents. In

of

addition to payment received from the survey company, we provided respondents with additional

ro

$10 Amazon.ca gift cards.

-p

To qualify for the survey, respondents had to satisfy the following inclusion criteria: (1.)

re

be 18 years or older; (2.) currently reside in a Canadian province; and (3.) indicate that they

lP

either (a.) experienced difficulties related to one of six listed disabilities for at least some of the

ur
na

time or (b.) experienced one of nine listed underlying health conditions.
Following the Canadian Survey on Disability (CSD) and guidance provided by the World
Health Organization and the Washington Group on Disability Statistics,5 we classified disability

Jo

based on respondents’ answers to six questions. Disability-related questions allowed respondents
to indicate the severity of their disability by reporting whether they never, sometimes, often, or
always experienced any vision, hearing, physical, cognitive, emotional, or other difficulties.
Questions were phrased as follows:
•

Do you have any difficulty seeing (even when wearing glasses or contact lenses)?

•

Do you have any difficulty hearing (even when using a hearing aid)?

3

The plan for this study was reviewed and approved by a Research Ethics Board at the University of Alberta (REB
Ethics ID Pro00101049) and at the University of Toronto (protocol reference number 39352).

As of June 22, 2020, there were 101,019 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Canada and 8,410 deaths with both cases
and deaths trending downward across the country (https://covid19.who.int/region/amro/country/ca).

Do you have any difficulty walking, using stairs, using your hands or fingers or
doing other physical activities?

•

Do you have any difficulty learning, remembering or concentrating?

•

Do you have any emotional, psychological or mental health conditions?

•

Do you have any other health problem or long-term condition that has lasted or is
expected to last for six months or more?

of

We classified chronic health conditions based on whether the respondent indicated the

ro

presence of the nine following conditions: Asthma; Cancer; Chronic kidney disease; Chronic

-p

respiratory or lung disease; Diabetes; Hypertension; Heart disease; Immunocompromised; or

re

Obesity. Answers were obtained from a single question, worded as: “Do you presently have any

lP

of the following health conditions? Please mark all that apply.” Health conditions were chosen

ur
na

based on those indicated by the Government of Canada as increasing vulnerability to COVID-19.
We began with 1,392 respondents. Twenty-nine cases were initially dropped due to poor
quality (including strings of profanity and repeated song lyrics) in their qualitative responses. An

Jo

additional 51 cases were removed because respondents did not complete the survey. In order to
ensure that respondents were carefully reading and answering the survey questions, we included
two quality control screening questions that required respondents provide a specific answer.
Those who did not correctly answer both quality control questions were screened out of the
survey. A final 285 cases were removed because respondents either did not meet the inclusion
criteria or failed quality control and attention checks. This resulted in a final sample of 1,027
respondents with no missing data across variables.
Data were collected via quota-based sampling to ensure a representative sample across
Canadian provinces with 38% of responses from Ontario, 23% from Québec, 13% from British

9

Columbia, 18% from the Prairie provinces (Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan), and 7% from the
Atlantic provinces (Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince
Edward Island) based on Statistics Canada 2016 Census population estimates. Models do not use
additional poststratification weights because this procedure requires the distribution of
characteristics in a population to be known 28. In this case, it was unclear as to which population
characteristics should be used since there has been no other random survey of individuals with

of

disabilities and chronic health conditions. However, many of the characteristics of this group

ro

(e.g., age, gender, and education) mirror those for individuals sampled in the CSD and Canadian

re

-p

Community Health Survey (CCHS), as discussed below and in the appendix.

lP

Measures

ur
na

Outcome variables measure three self-reported aspects of mental health, indicating
whether the respondent experienced any increases in anxiety, stress, or despair in the last 14
days (a time referring to early June 2020). Specific questions asked, “Have you experienced any

Jo

changes in [anxiety], [stress], [despair] within the last 14 days?” with the options of “decrease,”
“about the same,” and “increase.” For the purposes of our analyses, we coded any increases as
“1” and all other responses as “0.”
Predictor variables measure aspects of economic insecurity, illness concerns, social
isolation, and social distancing measures taken. In relation to economic insecurity, COVID-19effects on financial outcomes indicates whether COVID-19 affected a respondent's ability to pay
down debt, make mortgage or rent payments, pay utility bills, purchase groceries, or contribute
to savings to a moderate or great extent. This variable is coded as “1” if the respondent indicated
that COVID-19 affected any of these five separate areas and “0” if there were no effects across

10

areas. Concerns about contracting COVID-19 is an ordinal variable that indicates whether the
respondent was not concerned, somewhat concerned, or very concerned about contracting the
virus. Social isolation is captured with two measures -- whether the respondent reported
increased feelings of loneliness and whether they reported decreased feelings of belonging.
Finally, COVID-19 measures taken is a composite variable that comprises responses to
thirteen questions regarding different measures taken to combat COVID-19. These measures

of

include washing hands more often; avoiding public places; avoiding common greetings like

ro

kissing and/or handshaking; avoiding contact with individuals outside the household; avoiding

-p

gatherings with five or more people present; avoiding travel within Canada; using a separate

re

bathroom from others in the same household; staying in separate rooms within the household;

lP

shifting shopping to online; not physically going to work or school; wearing gloves and/or a

ur
na

mask when leaving the house; deferring medical/dental appointments; and avoiding outdoor
recreation. Values for the composite variable are the respondent's average across these binary
questions (0=no, 1=yes) with ⍺ = 0.77.

Jo

Models control for disability and health condition severity based on the number of
reported disabilities and health conditions. This categorical variable indicates whether the
respondent reported one, two or three, four or five, or six or more disabilities or chronic health
conditions. Other demographic control variables include age measured in years; gender with
three categories of male, female, and other; and marital status with four categories of never
married, cohabiting (living together but not married), currently married, and formerly married
(widowed, separated, or divorced). Models also control for the presence of any children in the
household, employment status with four categories of employed, unemployed, not in the labor
force due to being a homemaker or retired, and unable to work due to COVID-19; and whether

11

the respondent had a Bachelor's degree or higher for their highest level of education. Models
also include whether the respondent is a member of a racial minority group. This variable was
based on a question asking respondents to self-identify their race or ethnicity. Reduced

of

categories for this variable are used due to sample size limitations.

ro

Analytic Models

-p

We use three logistic regression models to examine the relationship between four sets of

re

predictor variables -- individuals’ concerns about contracting COVID-19, experiences of social

lP

isolation, social distancing measures taken, and broader financial situations – and three outcome

ur
na

variables – increases in anxiety, stress, and despair. We primarily discuss our results as predicted
probabilities and average marginal effects (AMEs), which present the marginal effects averaged
across the sample. For categorical variables, AMEs indicate the average difference in the

Jo

outcome variable associated with a discrete change in the predictor variable. For continuous
variables, AMEs provide the instantaneous rate of change in the outcome, calculated by taking
the derivative of the function, which shows the rate of change at a given point.

Results
Descriptive Results
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for all model variables. In total, 38.2% of
respondents with disabilities or chronic health conditions reported increased anxiety, 38.9%
reported increased stress, and 18.2% reported increased despair. Almost half of respondents
reported that COVID-19 had negatively affected their finances and most indicated that they were

of

either somewhat or very concerned about contracting the virus. Additionally, 30.8% reported

-p

[Table 1]

ro

increases in loneliness and 14.9% reported decreases in belonging.

re

The mean age for respondents in our sample was 49 years, which is older than the mean

lP

age of 41 years for the population in 201621. This was expected, however, because disabilities

ur
na

and chronic health conditions tend to be more prevalent among older populations5. The gender
make-up of our sample was 53% female, 46% male, and 1% non-binary or other. According to
the 2017 CSD, disabilities are more prevalent among women; 56% of people with disabilities

Jo

were female 5.

Approximately 47.7% of respondents were employed, 4.4% were unemployed, and
39.1% were not in the labor force. In this sample, 8.8% of respondents reported that they were
unable to work due to COVID-19. According to the 2017 CSD, the employment rate among
people with disabilities was 59.4% 5, which indicates a lower employment rate in our sample
(47.8%). However, percentages are much closer when respondents unable to work due to
COVID-19 are considered.
Racial and ethnic minority groups were underrepresented in this sample. The percentage
who identify as Indigenous within this sample (2.3%) was approximately half that of the

13

percentage in the larger population (4.9%) in 2016 21. The percentage who identify as non-white
in the sample (17.8%) was also lower than the percentage of people who identify as visible
minorities in Canada (22.3%). However, it is not clear as to whether these groups are over- or
under-represented within groups of people with disabilities and chronic health conditions.
When comparing sample respondents to individuals age 15 and older in Canada, the
sample closely mirrored the population in terms of marital status and household size. Within the

of

sample, 53.0% of respondents were married or cohabiting, 31.5% were never married, and

ro

15.5% were formerly married. Across Canada in 2016, 57.4% of individuals age 15 and older

-p

were married or in common law relationships, 28.2% were never married, and 14.2% were

re

formerly married 21.

Outcome Models

Results are presented in three sets of logistic regression models predicting increased
anxiety, stress, or despair in Tables 2-4 and Figures 1-3. Tables include both model coefficients

Jo

and average marginal effects (AMEs) for all variables. Figures present predicted probabilities of
increased anxiety (Figure 1), stress (Figure 2), and despair (Figure 3), as related to five COVID19 factors that potentially contribute to decreasing mental health status among an already
vulnerable group.

Anxiety
On average, 38.2% of respondents reported increases in anxiety since the pandemic
began (Table 1). Model results, presented as AMEs in Table 2, show that people who reported
that COVID-19 negatively affected their finances had a higher probability of reporting an

14

increase in anxiety by 9.3 percentage points, net of other covariates. Expanding on these
findings, Figure 1 presents predicted probabilities of experiencing increased anxiety associated
with different levels of each variable, along with 95% confidence intervals around the estimates.
It shows that 43.0% of respondents who reported that COVID-19 negatively affected their
finances experienced increased anxiety compared to 33.3% of respondents who saw no financial
effects. Compared to respondents who reported no concerns about contracting COVID-19, those

of

who were very concerned were 11.3 percentage points more likely to experience increased

ro

anxiety, as shown in Figure 1 and Table 2. Increases in anxiety were also much more common

-p

when respondents reported increased loneliness and decreased belonging. For instance, 63.3% of

lP

re

respondents who reported increased loneliness also reported increased anxiety.

[Table 2]

Jo

Stress

ur
na

[Figure 1]

Results for stress followed similar patterns to anxiety, as shown in Figure 2 and Table 3.
On average 38.9% of respondents reported increases in stress, but reports were higher when the
pandemic also affected respondents' finances, when they were very concerned about contracting
COVID-19, and when they experienced increased social isolation. Compared to respondents
whose finances remained stable during COVID-19, those who experienced negative effects on
their finances were 7.6 percentage points more likely to report increased stress (Table 3).
Respondents who were very concerned about contracting COVID-19 were 12 percentage points
more likely than those without any concerns to report increased stress. Finally, reporting

15

increased loneliness was associated with a 27.5 percentage point increase in stress and decreased
belonging was associated with a 15.6 percentage point increase. Presenting predicted
probabilities, Figure 2 shows that 42.8% of respondents who believed that COVID-19 negatively
affected their finances and 45.7% of respondents who were very concerned about contracting the
virus reported increased stress. Additionally, 60.7% of respondents who reported feelings of

re

-p

ro

[Figure 2]

of

increased loneliness and 53.2% who reported decreased belonging reported increased stress.

lP

Despair

ur
na

Fewer respondents reported feeling increases in despair during the pandemic with 18.1%
reporting increases on average. Reports of increased despair were higher again, though, among
people who also reported negative effects on finances, concerns about contracting COVID-19,

Jo

increases in loneliness, and decreases in belonging, as shown in Figure 3 and Table 4. Those
reporting increased loneliness and decreased belonging showed some of the highest rates of
increased despair; 32.6% of people reporting increases loneliness and 30.2% reporting a decrease
in belonging also reported increased despair.

[Figure 3]
[Table 4]

16

Discussion
Clear relationships were present when examining COVID-19 financial effects, concerns
about COVID-19, and increased social isolation. Supporting our first hypothesis, results show
that COVID-19 effects on financial outcomes were associated with increased anxiety, stress, and
despair. Those who were very concerned about contracting COVID-19 were more likely to
report increased anxiety, stress, and despair, supporting our second hypothesis. We also find

of

support for hypothesis three; those who reported increased loneliness were more likely to report

ro

increased anxiety, stress, and despair as were those who reported decreases in feelings of

-p

belonging. Net of other covariates, increased measures taken to combat COVID-19 was not

re

significantly associated with mental health outcomes, which did not support our expectations in

lP

hypothesis 4. Although models do not find evidence for the direct effects of protective measures

ur
na

on mental health outcomes, taking protective measures may still indirectly shape other factors
like social isolation and ability to perform work duties that contribute to mental health status.
There is some evidence that having multiple disabilities and chronic health conditions is

Jo

positively associated with decreasing mental health status, as is cohabitating and/or being
married. The latter may reflect recent findings showing the negative impacts of the pandemic on
households as it intersects with gender, childcare, and work 29. In the case of the former, our
findings suggest that declining mental health status is an issue for all people with disabilities and
chronic health conditions. Although we use a common scale developed and supported by
multiple disability groups, other measures perhaps related to the length of time the person has
had a disability or health condition may show more variable results. Future research should
directly investigate this potential variation.

17

Existing research points to two key dimensions regarding how social determinants of
health shape inequality in mental health status. First, pandemics aside, people with disabilities
and chronic health conditions are already more likely to worry about their health and experience
stress, isolation, and anxiety. Second, disasters and health pandemics like COVID-19 are
negatively associated with mental health outcomes in the general population. Much less is known
about how people with disabilities and chronic health conditions are handling the pandemic and

of

how prolonged disruptions to social and economic life contribute to negative mental health

ro

outcomes.

-p

Presenting findings from the only national survey of Canadians with disabilities and

re

chronic health conditions conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study provides

lP

important insight regarding the mental health situation of people in this marginalized group.

ur
na

Nevertheless, the study does have certain limitations related to our sampling procedures and
analyses.

First, our reliance on an online quota-based sample meant that we were unable to include

Jo

a fully representative sample. Time and resource-limitations associated with conducting large
surveys, inadequate sampling frames, as well as significant underrepresentation of marginalized
communities in large national surveys makes quota sampling extremely useful in studying the
immediate effects of health crises on people with disabilities and chronic health conditions.
Although quota sampling is not truly reflective of a random sample of the population, we
ensured representation across provinces and note that the Internet-based sample mirrors the
demographic characteristics of members of this population, which we discuss in more detail in
the Appendix.

18

Second, our goal of creating a diverse sample that considered multiple types of
disabilities and chronic health conditions meant that some respondents did not report severe
disabilities. Including people with less severe disabilities and health conditions likely produces
more conservative estimates of mental health status. Models show greater effects for those
individuals reporting multiple disabilities and health conditions. Additional surveys with larger
sample sizes would allow for better comparisons across individuals with different types of

of

disabilities and chronic health conditions. Larger sample sizes would also facilitate more robust

ro

comparisons among gendered and racial and ethnic minority groups and the intersection of

-p

multiple status characteristics. We recommend that future surveys also attempt to oversample

re

members of minority groups in order to achieve a better representation.

lP

Third, although we had hoped to provide additional accommodations to respondents with

ur
na

visual, cognitive, or other disabilities, we were unable to do so over the Qualtrics platform. It is
likely that many of the respondents with visual functional limitations used their own technology
that facilitated accessing the survey. This online survey likely missed people without access to

Jo

computers or the Internet, as well individuals with more severe disabilities lacking assistance
from caregivers and/or assistive technology.
Finally, with the goal of creating a clear and accessible survey, we included single
question measures that asked participants to self-assess changes in their levels of anxiety, stress,
and despair. We did not opt for a complex multi-item scale to measure stress and anxiety. Rather,
adapting mental health measures from the joint Vox Pop Labs, MassLBP, and Toronto’s St.
Michael’s Hospital national survey conducted in March 2020 with 2,439 Canadians,30 we asked
about increases in anxiety, stress, and despair in order to speak to changes in these mental health

19

outcomes since the onset of the pandemic. To assess the recency of such symptoms, we also
instructed respondents to consider only the last two weeks.
In addition to supporting public health investments31 especially in mental health1, the
findings in this study allude to important pathways to improving mental health outcomes among
people with disabilities and chronic health conditions during and post-pandemic. Study results
suggest that targeted aide including but not limited to financial supports, especially to a group

of

largely ineligible for income-support programs (like CERB in the Canadian case) as well as

ro

social programs and virtual connections that mitigate social isolation’s negative impacts on

Jo

ur
na

lP

re

-p

stress, anxiety and despair, can go a long way in improving mental health outcomes.

Conclusion
This study highlights mental health struggles among people with disabilities and chronic
health conditions illustrating how increases in anxiety, stress, and despair are associated with
COVID-19-induced financial hardship and increased social isolation as a result of adhering to
protective measures. More specifically, this study finds that people with disabilities and chronic
health conditions very concerned about contracting COVID-19, those with an increased sense of

of

loneliness and isolation as a result of the pandemic, and those experiencing negative financial

ro

outcomes due to the pandemic, report feeling more stressed, anxious, and have a greater sense of

Results are from a quota-based online survey administered from June 11-22, 2020 with the help
of Qualtrics (https://www.qualtrics.com), an internet-based survey research company, which
helped recruit participants to a sample of people with disabilities and chronic health conditions
across provinces. Qualtrics recruits participants from a range of online research panels with
which the company partners. These panels consist of pools of people who have been recruited to
take regular surveys for academic and corporate researchers. Panelists provide detailed and
updated personal information to panel maintainers, including demographic information.
Qualtrics, as a panel aggregator, matches respondents to surveys based on their profiles and
randomly selects them to take surveys that they are likely to quality for, based on a given
survey’s eligibility criteria.

ur
na

lP

re

In the case of our online survey, we provided Qualtrics with eligibility criteria based on age,
region, and health and disability status, which it used to recruit participants from appropriate
online panels to our survey. Qualtrics takes steps to ensure that a respondent does not take the
same survey multiples times or self-select into particular surveys based on the survey topic and
incentives. Our survey instrument also included additional screening questions and attention
checks to mitigate potential data quality issues. We included location-based sampling quotas to
ensure that the proportion of respondents from each province within our final sample matches the
proportion of the Canadian population located in each province.

Jo

Online samples of the type used in the survey conducted for this study are common in the social
sciences and frequently used as an alternative to much costlier traditional survey and sampling
methods, such as those based on telephone interviews and random digit dialing.
The median survey response time was 20 minutes and the mean 29 minutes. Survey response
times ranged from 6 minutes to 15 hours. Longer response times likely reflected instances where
respondents began the survey, left it open on their devices, and then went back to complete it
later on. Ninety-five percent of respondents completed the survey in under one hour and 80% of
respondents completed the survey in less than thirty minutes.
Disability and chronic health conditions variables
The final survey includes 1,027 respondents age 18 and older who reported having one or more
disabilities or health conditions. Disabilities include physical, cognitive, vision, hearing, and
emotional limitations. We also included a category related to "other" conditions lasting six
months or longer. Health conditions include asthma, cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic
respiratory disease, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, obesity, and anything associated with
being immunocompromised.

29

Expanding on the descriptive statistics presented in the full paper, Table B1 provides further
information regarding the prevalence of different disabilities and chronic health conditions
among sample participants. Overall, 10.6% of respondents reported a single disability or
condition, 35.0% reported 2-3 disabilities or conditions, 32.4% reported 4-5 disabilities or
conditions, and 22.0% reported six or more disabilities or conditions.
[Table B1]

of

Table B1 includes rates of any disability for whether the respondent indicated sometimes, often,
or always and rates of more severe disabilities for whether the respondent indicated often or
always. In both cases, emotional or other disabilities were the most commonly reported.

Regarding chronic health conditions, diabetes, asthma, hypertension, and obesity were the most
commonly chronic health conditions reported by participants. Fewer participants (<6%) reported
conditions like cancer, kidney disease, respiratory disease, heart disease, and being
immunocompromised.

lP

To further verify the representativeness of our sample, we compare our data to a subsample of
the 2017-18 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). Although this survey does not
include identical disability and health condition variables, it does provide variables close enough
to ours to allow for a comparison of demographics across a subsample of adults age 18+ with
reported disabilities or chronic health conditions.

Jo

The original 2017-18 CCHS sample included 113,290 cases. Removing missing data for our
variables of interest and restricting the sample to adults age 18 and older living in provinces
reduced our sample size to 94,797 cases. We then restricted this sample to individuals who
reported one or more disabilities or chronic health conditions, which resulted in a final sample
size of 60,082 cases.
Within this sample a respondent is considered to have a disability if they indicated that they had
some difficulty, a lot of difficulty, or inability (cannot do at all) in regard to seeing (even with
glasses), hearing (even with a hearing aid), walking or climbing stairs, remembering or
concentrating, self-care, or communicating. In order to include emotional disabilities, we also
counted individuals who reported that they had a major mood or anxiety disorder.
We also included individuals with the following chronic health conditions: asthma, respiratory
conditions, hypertension, heart diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Although we also wanted to
include obesity in this analysis, we omitted this variable due to the amount of missing data with
it. The survey also did not include questions regarding being immunocompromised.
Table B2 presents information regarding the prevalence of disability and chronic health
conditions in the full CCHS sample. In the larger sample, 43.7% of respondents reported any
disability (having at least some difficulty across designated areas) and 18.1% reported a more

30

severe disability (having a lot of difficulty or cannot do at all). Additional, 30.9% of respondents
reported having one of six designated chronic health conditions.
[Table B2]

of

Table B3 presents descriptive statistics for demographic variables in the CCHS subset of people
with disabilities or chronic health conditions. Comparing these to data from the 2020 COVID-19
Disability Survey, the CCHS sample is slightly older with a mean age of 51.6 years compared to
49.0 years in the COVID-19 Disability Survey. Gender composition is similar across surveys
with a slightly greater proportion of men in both. Notably, the CCHS did not permit respondents
to report a gender other than male or female. We also do not include a comparison based on
sexual identity due to the larger percentage of missing data on this variable in the CCHS.

ro

Similar to earlier comparisons with national population data, a comparison with the CCHS again
shows that immigrants and Indigenous persons were underrepresented within the COVID-19
Disability Survey sample. It also shows that our sample has attained somewhat higher levels of
education with 66.1% of the COVID-19 Disability Survey obtaining a PSE certificate or higher
compared to 59.1% of CCHS respondents. Employment rates were closer across surveys. In the
COVID-19 Disability Survey, 47.7% of respondents were employed at the time of the survey
compared to 50.0% of CCHS respondents. As expected during the pandemic, the unemployment
rate among COVID-19 Disability Survey respondents was higher.

The CCHS marital status variable categories differ from those used in the COVID-19 Disability
Survey, but it appears as those marriage rates were lower in the COVID-19 Disability Survey.
Within the COVID-19 Disability Survey 39.5% of respondents were married, 13.4% were
cohabiting, 15.5% were formerly married, and 31.5% were never married. Within the CCHS,
50.0% of respondents were married, 11.8% were in common law unions, 16.1% were formerly
married, and 22.1% were single.
[Table B3]

Finally, Table B4 presents information regarding the prevalence of different types of disabilities
and chronic health conditions in the CCHS subsample. This table shows that most specific
disabilities were more prevalent across respondents in the COVID-19 Disability Survey. A
greater percentage of COVID-19 Disability Survey respondents were also more likely to report
most conditions, except for hypertension and heart disease, which were more prevalent in the
CCHS subsample.
It is important to note that the ways in which questions were phrased and the options given to
respondents differ across surveys. For instance, COVID-19 Disability Survey respondents were
given options of “no,” “sometimes,” “always,” and “never.” CCHS respondents were given
options of “no difficulty,” “some difficulty,” “a lot of difficulty,” and “cannot do at all / unable
to do.”

Overall, this comparison between the 2020 COVID-19 Disability Survey and the 2017-18 CCHS
subsample of people with disabilities and chronic health conditions shows both similarities and
differences across survey respondents. Although age and gender composition are similar across
survey respondents, differences do appear in regard to race and education. It is important to note
that the disabilities and conditions included across surveys are not identical, however, a factor
that could also affect the composition of survey respondents.
