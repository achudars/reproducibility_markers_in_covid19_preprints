A BSTRACT
Public commentary has offered mixed opinion on the likely impact of COVID-19 restrictions on drug-related
offending. On the one hand, it is argued that drug users—and the drug markets in which they interact—may
have become the incidental targets of law enforcement as police seek to enforce social distancing regulations
by focusing their efforts on street-level pedestrian activity or open-air gatherings. On the other, interstate
border closures and restrictions on person and freight traffic are thought to have interrupted illicit drug supply
chains, temporarily reducing or displacing market activity at the street level and thus reducing police detections of drug users. In this study, we extend current analyses of crime during the COVID-19 pandemic to
explore how the rate of police detection for drug possession and other drug-related offences has changed.
Using Queensland crime data, we use Auto-Regressive and Moving Average (ARIMA) time series modelling
techniques to explore historical trends and their dynamic forecasts. We then compare actual offence rates for
March through June to identify any statistically significant changes. Importantly, we do not expect the impact
of COVID-19 regulations to be universal, mostly because of the significant heterogeneity in local drug market dynamics that has elsewhere been documented. Our analysis has significant import for criminal justice
practitioners in further understanding drug market dynamics and drug-related offending during COVID-19
restrictions.

Introduction

COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a global
pandemic by the World Health Organisation ([WHO], 2020) on March 11, 2020. Not since the 1918 Spanish Flu has the
world experienced such a wide-reaching public health crisis; one that has resulted in unprecedented public health and economic
measures aimed at reducing the spread of the virus and mitigating economic consequences, respectively. In response, Australia
moved quickly to implement a number of policies in an effort to reduce the rate of transmission within the community. These
efforts have included, but were not limited to, the closure of schools, the closure of most non-essential businesses, and the
closure of international borders with a 14-day quarantine period for all returning travellers. Furthermore, these restrictions also
extended to limits on public and street-based gatherings (up to two people) and the federal government advised Australians to
only leave their homes for exercise, essential shopping, to access medical services, and for work/education activities that could
not be completed remotely (see also Payne & Morgan, 2020). Without question, the advent of this global pandemic and the
introduction of wide-reaching mobility and physical distancing measures represents a unique, once-in-a-generation opportunity
for both the policy and research sectors.
The extent to which COVID-19 has impacted drug users and drug markets remains unknown, although there has been some
reporting of both upside and downside pressures. On the one hand, it is expected that drug-related offending (in this case, pos∗

session and supply offences) will have increased during the pandemic, either because drug users are more likely to experience
incidental detection during routine street-based policing activity, or as a direct result of increased police targeting of known drug
users and drug markets. In the case of the latter, there are some early reports that falls in property and violent crime have freed
resources to focus on proactive policing opportunities that directly target or incidentally detect drug users. On the other hand,
it is has been suggested that the significant restrictions on the movement of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, including interstate
travel here in Australia, is likely to have reduced supply or shifted nominal drug market activity into different locations (most
likely residential). This, it is believed, is likely to have made it more difficult for police to target and intervene in drug transactions. For now, both arguments are anecdotal and speculative, and it is here that the present study seeks to offer some new
insights. To the knowledge of the authors’, this study offers the first analysis of changes in rates of drug-offending (possession
and supply) during COVID-19. We use data from the state of Queensland, Australia, to answer two important questions: did
the rate of detection for drug possession and drug supply change during COVID-19 restrictions (March to June 2020) and were
these changes geographically homogenous?

2

Prior Literature

In this study, we seek to determine whether rates of drug offending (drug possession and supply) changed during the first
few months of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is a very limited foundation of empirical research from which to
draw our hypotheses. In our comprehensive literature search, we located only one study that focussed exclusively on drugrelated offending (Bergeron, Décary-Hétu, & Giommoni, 2020), which examined the effects of COVID-19 on online drug
transactions and crypto-market responses. Much of the commentary, thus far, has been speculative, albeit informed by drug
user and drug market responses to different conditions and contexts. Further afield, criminology has responded quickly to the
opportunities and challenges of COVID-19 and numerous research studies have emerged offering an analysis of crime rates
throughout the pandemic. Much of this work has focused on the traditional crime categories of violence (Abrams, 2020; Davey,
2020; Freeman, 2020; Payne & Morgan, 2020; Payne, Morgan & Piquero, 2020; Shepherd, 2020) and property offending
(Ashby, 2020; Gerrel et al., 2020; Campedelli et al., 2020; Payne & Morgan, 2020; Mohler et al., 2020) and, although still
in its infancy, the meta-story paints a mixed picture of a large and statistically significant reduction in some but not all crime
types. In this literature review, we begin with a brief summary of the Australian experience of COVID-19 and focus on the
Queensland specific policy and regulatory response throughout the months of March-June 2020. We then turn to our attention
to the question of drug-related offending and review what is currently known or might be hypothesised about the likely trends
in these crime types.
2.1

COVID-19 in Australia

The rate of COVID-19 infection and transmission in Australia has remained relatively low, with the most recent "second-wave"
of infection being being experienced in Victoria. The majority of early Australian COVID-19 cases had acquired their infection
from overseas travel, or from contact with a confirmed case who had travelled overseas (Australian Department of Health, 2020).
Nationwide, containment measures were coordinated by the federal government through the National Cabinet (see Bonyhady
& Duke, 2020), though individual states and territories had autonomy in choosing which restrictions to implement, and the
timeline upon which to implement them. Queensland was decisive in its response to COVID-19 and was the first Australian
state to declare a public health emergency under the Public Health Act 2005 on January 29, 2020 (Queensland Department of
the Premier and Cabinet, 2020).
In addition to the widespread restrictions already introduced by the federal government, Queensland borders were closed March
26 (Queensland Government, 2020a) and interstate travel was restricted to only residents, and individuals living in border
communities undertaking essential services and activities (Queensland Government, 2020a). School closures came into effect
on March 30 and were only open for children of essential service workers (Welburn, 2020). In early April, further restrictions
were introduced, and only Queensland residents could cross the border, effectively closing off all tourism and non-essential
travel (Queensland Government, 2020a). These restrictions were enforceable by law throughout mid-late May. At time of
writing, and in line with relaxing restrictions elsewhere in the country, except notably in Victoria, Queensland has begun easing
some restrictions, including borders reopening, and relaxing the limits on public gatherings (Queensland Government, 2020c).
However, what impacts these restrictions have had on drug use and drug-related offending is unknown.
2.2

Changes in drug use

Not long after the pandemic was declared both policy and research experts warned of an increase in community level drug
use (Lee & Bartle, 2020; McGowan, 2020). Three main mechanisms were cited as a likely cause of this increase. First, the
temporary closure of the entertainment and hospitality industries was predicted to result in a large increase in unemployment,
particularly among young Australians (Coates, Cowgill, Chen, & Mackey, 2020; Noble, Hurley, & Macklin, 2020). Work- and
stay-at-home orders also meant that a large proportion of those who continued to work did so from home (Beck & Hensher,
2

A PREPRINT - O CTOBER 2020

2020). Social distancing regulations restricted mass gatherings, putting a temporary end to major sporting events, and significantly limiting smaller gatherings (Beck & Hensher, 2020), effectively ending the night-time economy and other entertainment
opportunities (Beck & Hensher, 2020). Collectively, these measures have meant that many Australians stayed home, unable to
undertake their normal work and absent of the rituals of their employment to govern their daily activities. Coupled with the
abrupt end to most forms of outside entertainment and social engagement, this is believed to have resulted in an increase in
recreational drug use (Lee & Bartle, 2020; McGowan, 2020).
Second, emotional, and financial consequences of COVID-192 will likely result in an increase in community-level drug use,
specifically as a coping strategy (Dietze & Peacock, 2020). The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ([UNODC], 2020)
has itself warned that the financial pressures and strain of COVID-19 may increase substance use due to a deterioration of both
individual- and societal-level socioeconomic outcomes. This is most likely to manifest as an increase in the frequency and
quantity of use among existing users, but there is also some potential that new drug users might emerge in the context of the
pandemic (Dietze & Peacock, 2020). Of most concern is the disproportionate impact that unemployment and social isolation
will have on pre-existing drug users who are a disadvantaged population (Bonn, 2020) that already experience significant
social and personal consequences of their drug use (Human Rights Watch, 2016; Stevens, Hughes, Hulme, & Cassidy, 2019).
Further, being known as a "junkie" or "addict" (Joyce, Sklenar, & Weatherby, 2019) is already associated with a range of
socially isolating and stigmatising effects and so COVID-19 may serve to exacerbate existing drug use trajectories. To date,
the empirical evidence on community level drug use is limited and mixed. Here in Australia, the National Drug and Alcohol
Research Centre ([NDARC], 2020) reported an increase in both cannabis and alcohol use among a convenience sample of
regular illicit drug users ([n=702], i.e. those who used at least once a month in the past 12 months), but a decrease in the use of
MDMA and cocaine.
The third mechanism cited as a potential cause for an increase in drug use is a reduction in treatment availability and utilisation
among drug users. COVID-19 restrictions have significantly impacted the service delivery capacities of drug and alcohol
treatment facilities, and some have needed to cease their services altogether, even if temporarily (McCauley, 2020; McGowan,
2020). In positive news, the Australian Federal Government pledged an additional $6 million to the delivery of online treatment
programs (Australian Department of Health, 2020a), but some have argued that this funding is inadequate (see McGowan,
2020) because physical distancing regulations have placed an even greater burden on already over-stretched, under-resourced
treatment programs throughout the country (Howard, 2020; McGowan, 2020). Further, drug users are likely to suffer severe
health consequences of their drug use—partly due to a reduced ability to access appropriate healthcare and drug treatment,
potentially putting them at increased risk of contracting and suffering severe complications of COVID-19 (Lee & Bartle, 2020).
It follows that those who were accessing drug or other medical treatment prior to COVID-19 are now potentially unable to
access those services and may be less motivated to seek support for their drug use (see Bonn, 2020).
2.3

Changes in drug supply and drug market dynamics

Another potential impact of COVID-19 is the disruption to global, national, and local drug supply chains as a consequence
of international and interstate border closures (UNODC, 2020). In Australia, international passenger arrivals from mainland
China were restricted from 1 February (ABC News, 2020), while interstate movements into Queensland were restricted from 26
March (Cansdale, 2020). Although it is difficult to know at this early stage how these restrictions impacted street-level supply,
there have been several anecdotal reports of drug users and drug markets adapting in harmful ways. For example, the practice of
illicit drug ‘stockpiling’ and ‘bulk-buying’ has been documented (Hamilton & Stevens, 2020; Winstock et al., 2020), especially
in the UK and Mexico (Felbaba-Brown, 2020; Reynolds, 2020) with the consequence of distorting street level markets with
rapidly increasing prices (Lee & Bartle, 2020) and decreasing drug purities (Birch, 2020; Hillier, 2020; Reynolds, 2020).
Evidence from the Global Drug Survey (Winstock et al., 2020), in which over 60,000 participants over 11 countries took part,
shows that just over half (56%, n=31,254) reported that there was decreased availability of illicit drugs compared to before
COVID-19, but that the purity and range of drugs remained largely unchanged. However, while just over half of respondents
(52%, n=29,021) reported that their last drug transaction was not impacted by COVID-19, one in ten (10%) reported longer
wait times to get drugs than usual, and 14 percent reporting paying a higher price than usual. For the average drug user, these
changes are likely to result in riskier drug using habits, including but not limited to an increase in drug use (Hamilton & Stevens,
2020), substitution with unfamiliar substances (Hamilton & Stevens, 2020; Reynolds, 2020), and a host of other complicating
health consequences (McGowan, 2020; Hamilton, 2020; Hamilton & Stevens, 2020; Reynolds, 2020).
Much like other analyses of crime rates during COVID-19 in Queensland (see Payne & Morgan, 2020), street-level drug market
activity is also likely to be affected by social distancing regulations which serve to significantly limit pedestrian traffic in
normally busy shopping districts, transit hubs and economic zones (Dietze & Peacock, 2020). Google (2020) mobility data
for the month of May confirms this, showing a 40 percent decrease (relative to the months of January and February) in time
2
For example, evidence from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) for the months of March and April—when physical distancing
regulations were introduced in Australia—shows that 42% of Australians felt restless, with a further 35% reporting feelings of nervousness,
and 11% reporting feelings of hopelessness (ABS, 2020).

spent at transit stations, as well as a 13 percent and 16 percent reduction in time spent at parks and retail/recreation locations,
respectively. This sudden and dramatic shift in nominal pedestrian activity is likely to have reduced the opportunities for
concealment and makes local drug market activity more visible to law enforcement. Even without an increase in community
level drug use or any specific targeting by police, drug possession and supply offences may well have increased during the
COVID-19 restrictions simply as a function of the heightened visibility of drug markets.
2.4

Changes in policing priorities and practices

Finally, it is also possible that drug-related offending may have fluctuated during the beginning of the pandemic as a consequence of the shift in policing priorities—from routine policing activities to the enforcement of social distancing regulations.
Under the relevant federal guidelines, members of the community were prohibited from gathering in public places in groups
of more than two (Australian Department of Health, 2020b) and street policing efforts are known to have been re-directed to
enforcing these new rules (Brown & Lewis, 2020; Human Rights Law Centre, 2020). As a result, police effort and attention
has been significantly diverted to the street-based exchanges of pedestrians, some of whom may be engaged in drug selling and
supply, and some of whom may be incidentally detected for the possession of drugs during other encounters with police (see
Morgan, 2020). In New South Wales (NSW), for example, we know that the use of drug detection dogs had not been suspended
because of COVID-19 (see Gregorie, 2020).
Incidental detention aside, there is also a growing concern that law enforcement have used the COVID-19 restrictions as an
opportunity to proactively target some populations of individuals, including drug users. The use of ‘targeted’ and ‘proactive
patrols’ has been reported in NSW (see Levin & Kashyap, 2020) while in Queensland transport hubs have become the focus of
a ‘crack-down’ on drug users and drug possession ("Brisbane train stations become focus in drug crackdown", May 13, 2020).
Proactive efforts to target drug users as a specific interest in COVID-19-related policing will likely increase the reported rates
of drug possession and supply offences.

3

The current study

The growing literature offers no clear hypothesis for a change in drug-related offences during the COVID-19 pandemic, although most explanations suggest that drug possession and supply offences may have increased, either because drug use rates
have increased, because drug sellers and users have become more visible to police, or because police have intentionally targeted
known drug users and drug market hotspots. Until now, this has been speculation and it is here that this study offers one of
the first empirical analyses of drug detention during the pandemic. Specifically, we use officially recorded drug offence rates
to model the offence-rate trend over six years between February 2014 and February 2020. We then compute dynamic forecasts
and compare these with the observed offence rates for the four months between April and June 2020.3

Methodology

4.1

Data

These data are drawn from the Queensland Government’s Open Data Portal ([ODP] Queensland Government, 2020b). The
ODP reports state-wide monthly offence rates per 100,000 of the Queensland population, as well as offence rates for each of
the 78 Local Government Areas (LGAs) across the state. The most recent addition to these data were for the month of June
2020. For this study, we use the offence rates for drug possession, sell/supply/trafficking offences combined, as well as am
‘other drug’ offences category4 .
4.2

Measures

For each of the offence categories, we operationalise an Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model on the
monthly offence rate between February 2014 and February 2020. To do this, we use fable v0.2.1 (O’Hara-Wild, Hyndman,
3

Readers are to be reminded that physical distancing and other COVID restrictions came into effect in Queensland in mid-to-late March,
were in effect for the entirety of the month of April and had begun easing mid-late May/early June. Given that this paper is primarily
concerned with the effects of COVID-19 on drug-related offending in the early momths of the pandemic, the four-month period used in this
study was chosen to reflect the three stages of Queensland restrictions, namely: pre-restrictions, during restrictions, and post/ongoing, but
eased, restrictions.
4
This combined category includes unlawful possession of restricted drugs; owning property which is obtained from trafficking drugs; possessing drug-related things or utensils; permitting use of a place for an offence related to dangerous drugs; possession of restricted chemicals
and drug laboratory equipment. See https://queenslandlawhandbook.org.au/the-queensland-law-handbook/offenders-and-victims/drugs/drugoffences-and-penalties-in-queensland/ for more information.

& Wang 2020), a time series forecasting routine operationalized for use with the statistical program R (R Core Team, 2020).
ARIMA models are a specific type of time series forecasting technique which capitalize on several key time-series parameters—the series trend and seasonality, its lagged auto correlations and its lagged partial auto-correlations (correlations between
residual errors). Put simply, past values of each time series are used to identify predictable patterns. These patterns are then
used to specify a statistical model from which forecasts can be computed. Like all models, the relative accuracy of any forecast
depends on the strength of the relationship between past and future values.
Using fable, the final ARIMA specification for each offence type is derived from an iterative parameter search algorithm. The
algorithm is a variation of that which was proposed by Hyndman and Khandakar (2008) for automatic ARIMA modelling.
Specifically, the need for trend and seasonal differencing is first identified using a series of KPSS tests (see Kwiatkowski,
Phillips, Schmidt, & Shinn 1992). Then, the AR and MA parameters are optimized through a series of comparative model
analyses in which four baseline models are calculated and compared. The best of these baseline models (based on the model
which produces the smallest Aikake Information Criteria (AIC)) is then used as the starting point for an iterative model search
function that tests single unit changes to the AR and MA parameters. Any new model that outperforms the starting model
(again, based on the AIC) is selected and the iterative search function is repeated until such time as no alternative model can be
found (see Hyndman & Athanasopoulos, 2020).
At the conclusion of the automated ARIMA modelling procedure, two estimates of model accuracy are calculated – the Mean
Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Both are derived by ‘training’ each model on
the in-sample data for 2014-2018 and then comparing the model performance against the out-sample data for 2019. The MASE
(see Hyndman and Kohler 2002) is a numerical representation of the error produced by the forecast for 2019, compared to the
average error produced by a naïve model for 2014-2018. A MASE estimate less than the value of one implies that the ARIMA
model out-performs a basic one-step ahead naïve model. A value greater than one implies the model is no better (or possible
worse) than a naïve estimation. MAPE is an estimate of the average error produced by the forecast in for the out-sample data in
2019. In this case, month-by-month error is defined as the percentage difference between the forecast and the observed offence
rates. The average of these errors percentages represents the MAPE. Crucially, offence series with little or no offence counts
will produce extreme estimates of MASE greater than the value of one (values approaching infinity). Similarly, some offence
counts are simply too low or longitudinally volatile to produce reasonable ARIMA forecasts. These models result in large
values for MAPE. In this study, we treat any model with extreme values of MASE (>100) and/or MAPE (>50%) as ‘not able to
be estimated’.
For all estimable models we then use the final specification to forecast point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for a
six-month period ending in August 2020. We then compare the observed offence rates for March to June 2020 to the forecasted
point estimate for the same month. We also consider its position within the confidence interval of the forecast and we only
conclude that the offence rate has changed under COVID-19 conditions if the observed value falls outside the upper or lower
bounds of the 95% confidence interval.
Finally, to explore geographical heterogeneity we repeat the procedures above on the offence-specific time-series data for each
of the 78 LGAs in Queensland. A total of 234 models were executed and the results are summarised here in this paper with
a specific focus on the 12 LGAs that have a population greater than 100,000. In this paper, we provide a summary of these
results as comparisons of the forecasted and observed rates (presented as an estimate of the ratio-difference) with an indication
of whether the observed rate was statistically lower or higher.

Results
Drug possession

Between 2014 and 2019, state-wide drug possession offence rates have averaged at around 60 offences per month, per 100,000
of the population, fluctuating between a low of 45 in April 2018 and a high of 78 in August 2016 (Figure 1). A seasonal pattern
indicates that drug possession offence rates are typically higher in winter and lower in summer. From this historical data, the
ARIMA model forecasted an increase in drug possession offending for March through August, coinciding with the advent of
COVID-19 and the introduction of social distancing. The actual observed rates of drug possession offending were statistically
lower than was forecasted in March, then statistically higher than forecasted for April, May, and June. The increase in drug
possession offending in the latter three months exceeded the normal seasonal increase and in May the rate of drug possession
offending (90 per 100,000) was the highest ever recorded in the history of the series.
Across the state’s 78 LGAs, the drug possession offending rate of 29 LGAs could be reliably modelled using ARIMA methods.
In the majority of these LGAs, drug possession offending was higher than predicted for April (n=23), May (n=26) and June
(n=25), although only in May were the majority of these increases statistically significant (n=16). In general terms, the increase
in drug possession offending, particularly in May, was a state-wide phenomenon with very few LGAs recording a lower-thanforecast rate and none recording a statistically significant decline.

A PREPRINT - O CTOBER 2020

Of the 12 most populated LGAs in Queensland (those with a population greater than 100,000), the largest increase (measured
as the percentage difference between the observed and forecasted rate) was seen in Redlands City Council in May, where drug
possession offending was 85 percent higher than forecast. This was followed by Logan City Council and Mackay Regional
Council in May (+58%). Conversely, the Sunshine Coast Regional LGA saw drug possession offences rates increase by just 20
percent in May, a result that was not statistically significant and might have reflected normal period-by-period variation.
Since the official government social distancing restrictions were implemented in late March and early April, the totality of
change throughout the pandemic (so far) can be measured as the average percentage difference between the total number of
actual drug possession offences and the total number of forecasted offences in the three months from April to June. This
essentially smooths the month-by-month fluctuations and identifies LGAs that were relatively more or less affected during
the pandemic. The results of this averaging suggest that state-wide, drug possession offending was higher than forecast by a
magnitude of 29 percent. Some LGAs saw a more dramatic increase, including Mackay Regional Council (+57%) and Logan
City Council (54%), while the average impact in other LGAs was relatively small. For example, the Gold Coast City and
Sunshine Coast Regional Councils, drug possession offending was only 14 percent and 17 percent higher than forecast across
the April-June period.

Sell, supply, and trafficking offences

The historical rate of sell/supply/trafficking offences is highly variable (Figure 2) and from this historical data, the ARIMA
model forecasted an increase for July, but a stable rate for the months of March, April, May, and June. The observed rates of
sell/supply/trafficking offences were statistically higher than was forecasted in March, then statistically lower than forecasted
for April, May, and June. However, the observed offences rate did not exceed the modelled 95% confidence interval (see Figure
2) and so we cannot conclude that these offences changed under COVID-19 conditions. State-wide, sell/supply/trafficking
offences increased during April and May (3% and 19%, respectively) but decreased by 32 percent in June. At the LGA level,
sell/supply/trafficking offences 4 LGAs could be reliably modelled using ARIMA. For this offence type, the largest increase
was seen in Gold Coast City Council in April, where the recorded rate of offending rate was 319 percent higher than forecast.
This was followed by Cairns Regional Council in May which reported a 310 percent increase in these offences. Conversely,
Brisbane City Council saw supply/sell/trafficking offence rates decrease by 24 percent in May, a result that was not statistically
significant and might reflect normal variation.
[Figure 2 about here.]
5.3

Other drug offences

Other drug offences have similarly fluctuated across the same period (Figure 3), with the observed rate of offending being lower
(and not statistically significant) for both March and April, but statistically significant and higher than forecast for May and
June (Figure 3). In addition, the offence rate of 26 LGAs could be reliably modelled (see Table 1). Across LGAs, other drug
offending was higher than predicted for April (n=16), May (n=20) and June (n=22), however only in May were the majority of
these increases statistically significant (n=5). The largest increase was seen in Mackay Regional Council in May, where other
drug offending was 72 percent higher than forecast. This was followed by Brisbane (+67%) and Townsville City Councils in
May (+55%). Conversely, however, Gold Coast City Council saw other drug offence rates increase by just 11 and 7 percent in
May and June, respectively.

Discussion

COVID-19 represents a once-in-a-generation global public health threat. The impact of this pandemic on numerous policy sectors has drawn considerable attention from scholars and researchers internationally. However, very little research has examined
the impacts of COVID-19 on detections for drug-related offending. This study offers one of the first dedicated analyses of
this topic using aggregate and geographically disaggregate data from the Australian state of Queensland—the third largest in
the country by population. Our analysis was motivated by two main objectives. The first was to examine whether the rate of
detection for drug possession, supply/selling/trafficking offences, and a combined ‘other drug’ offence category had changed
during the period COVID-19 restrictions were in effect (modelled between the months of March and June). The second was to
explore whether these changes were geographically homogenous across Queensland’s 78 LGAs.
The results show that state-wide drug possession offence rates in Queensland increased statistically in April and remained
statistically above forecast through to the end of June. Drug selling/supply/trafficking offences were unchanged throughout
7

the same period, although we note that the small number of offences and high volatility in the historical series makes accurate
forecasting difficult5 . For the final category of ‘other drug offences’—which captures a wider range of drug-related offences
(but not possession or supply)—offence rates also increased beyond statistical expectations in May and June. In conclusion, the
detection rates of drug possession and other drug related offences were higher than would have been expected in the absence of
the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated social distancing regulations.
Geographically, the above-mentioned trends were relatively consistent across the state. For example, of the 29 LGAs with
sufficient data to generate drug possession forecasts, the rate was higher than forecast in 23 LGAs in April, 26 in May and
25 in June. For other drug offences, forecasts could be generated for 26 LGAs and the offence rate was higher than forecast
in 20 LGAs in May and 22 in June. Of course, not all of these increases were statistically significant, but where statistically
significant results were found, they were almost universally (with one exception) for increases in the offence rate. The data on
selling/supply/trafficking was simply too sparse to disaggregate into many LGA specific forecasts, but of the four that could be
modelled, none exhibited any statistically significant change.
While it is true that drug possession and other drug-related offending increased during the early months of the COVID-19
pandemic in Australia, it is beyond these data to identify the precise cause of this increase. Anecdotal evidence has suggested
that consequent to declines in other crime rates (see Payne, Morgan, & Piquero 2020), police may have been afforded some
additional operational time to target drug markets with greater intensity than usual. We think this is possible, but not at a statewide level, otherwise the data would have shown a commensurate increase in drug selling, supply, and trafficking offences,
which it did not. Instead, it was drug users who have been detected at higher than usual rates, presumably in the possession of
small, non-trafficable quantities of drugs and/or drug use paraphernalia.
Perhaps these results are an artefact of an increase in community-level drug use, something others have suggested might be
a consequence of the pandemic (Dietze & Peacock, 2020). In our view, these data cannot speak to the broader question of
community-level drug use, however we doubt that any increase in community level use would result in such a rapid increase
in detections by police. To be sure, drug possession detections likely only represent a fraction of all drug use activity across
the community, and a 30 percent increase in detections would imply an implausibly large increase in community-level use,
holding all other factors constant. Instead, we think it is more likely that the increase in drug possession detection has resulted
from COVID-19 related changes to day-to-day policing practice. Specifically, the higher than forecast drug possession rate
is most likely a consequence of a proactive policing approach that has diverted policing resources away from their normal
investigative and enforcement activities and in favour of street-level and community-style policing activities. With more police
on the street enforcing stay-at-home and social distancing regulations, the probability of detection for drug possession was
presumably higher than normal.
Notwithstanding the potential increased risk of detection that has resulted from a change in police practice, it is also likely that
this risk has been compounded by a change in the visibility of drug users. Social mobility data has demonstrated a large shift
in normal pedestrian activity across areas of cities and towns that are normally bustling with economic and social activity (see
Google 2020). As has been shown by others (see Brown & Lewis, 2020; Dietze & Peacock, 2020; Gregorie, 2020; Morgan,
2020), overt drug market activity tends to occur in these same places (transport hubs and retail districts) with high pedestrian
and street activity shielding drug users from detection6 . As a result, any rapid and dramatic shift in pedestrian activity is likely
to have made local drug market transactions more visible to the police.
There is one complexity we think is worth noting here. Specifically, an increase in the rate of offending can occur either as
a result of an increase in prevalence (a larger number of people being detected), an increase the frequency (the same number
of people being detected, just more frequently), or both. Without individual-level longitudinal data, it is impossible to know
which of these is the principal driver, however this distinction will be important for generating a more fulsome understanding
of the increase. For example, our discussion so far has assumed some stability or consistency in the behaviour of drug users
and that drug detections increased as a result of changes in policing activity. The opposite may also be true—that the behaviour
of drug users changed during the pandemic, making them more vulnerable to detection even if policing activity remained
unchanged. Emerging evidence from elsewhere in Australia suggests that COVID-19 restrictions have fundamentally changed
the methamphetamine market (Voce, Finney, Gately, & Sullivan, 2020), and as a result it is likely that drug user behaviour has
also changed in response, involving new buying and selling behaviours (e.g. stockpiling), and engaging in online transactions.
Further, there is a wealthy history of drug-crime research which links dependency-related compulsive behaviour with increased
criminal activity (see, for example, Bennett & Holloway, 2009; Felson & Staff, 2017; Gizzi & Gerkin, 2010), and the likely
COVID-19-related disruption to drug markets may have necessitated the need for more overt or risky drug market interactions.
5
In Australia, drug possession offences comprise almost 90% of all national illicit drug arrests (Australian Crime Intelligence Commission,
2018) and so it is not surprising that trafficking and sell/supply offences were relatively infrequent in number, and that the overall trend was
difficult to forecast.
6
As foreshadowed in the introduction to this paper, drug markets have multifaceted and diverse international supply chains and export
routes; however, the majority of drug market behaviour is localised to specific regions and locations, and the behaviour of these markets is
dictated by the specific characteristics of the locations in which they are embedded.

8

It is also possible that drug users are potentially less likely to comply with COVID-19 restrictions (specifically those that call
for stay-at-home orders) and less likely to desist from both crime and drug use. Without individual-level offending data we
cannot be certain, and this is an area that requires further research.
We end this analysis with a reflection on those atypical results that are somewhat hidden in the wider story of this paper. For
example, although the data on sell, supply and trafficking offences was difficult to forecast, two locations stood out. These
were the Gold Coast City Council and Cairns Regional Council, where sell-supply offences increased by 319 percent and 310
percent, in April and May, respectively. As a qualification to our general conclusion above, it seems likely that there was some
proactive campaign to target drug market operators in these two locations7 . Of particular note was that drug possession offences
did not increase in the Gold Coast by the same order of magnitude (up by only 1.3% in April). Only detailed information from
Queensland police about the nature of their operational activities will help to clarify what contributed to this result, although
for the Gold Coast, at least, we understand that there was concentrated effort by police to target drug distribution through
Operation Sierra Hill (Vondern, 2020). While little is known about the specifics of Operation Sierra Hill, we do know that
several high-ranking members of the Queensland Police Force were detained in August for related offences (Vondern, 2020).
In any case, further research is needed to investigate the individual characteristics of these LGAs to truly understand the impact
of COVID-19 on drug-related offending.

It is important to note that the Gold Coast City Council shares a border with NSW, and that this border has been closed since March
26 (Queensland Government, 2020a). Given this, and the restrictions on freight and border crossings, it is possible that the significant rise
in sell-supply offences for the month of April in the Gold Coast City Council was the result of drug market operators attempting to cross
the border with large quantities of illicit drugs—either being imported into Queensland, or being exported into NSW. This same explanation,
however, does not hold for Cairns, which is on the northern-most tip of the state.
