Abstract
Using primary data from the Assessing the Social Consequences of COVID-19 study (N=1,647),
we examined how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the stress levels (i.e., pre-pandemic
vs. during-pandemic stress) of women with and without coresiding minor children, paying
special attention to the moderating role of women’s employment status. Results from OLS
regression models show that following the pandemic outbreak, among women who worked fulltime, mothers reported smaller stress increases than non-mothers. Among part-time and nonemployed women, mothers and non-mothers experienced similar levels of stress increase.
Changes in women’s work hours and employment status, following the pandemic onset, had
limited impacts on the patterns of stress level changes. This study contributes to research on
parenting and health by showing that during times of crisis, full-time employment may play a
protective role for mother’s mental health, but may not buffer the mental health deterioration
of women not raising children.

The COVID-19 pandemic, which started early 2020 and continues at the time of this writing, has
disrupted the lives of individuals and families to levels unseen by contemporary adults (Pew
Research Center 2020a, 2020b). Worrying about one's health and economic well-being, adults
report higher levels of stress compared to pre-pandemic periods (Fitzpatrick, Harris, and Drawve
2020; Salari et al. 2020). These stressful feelings have been exacerbated due to the complete
overhaul of people’s daily routines by the lock-down measures (such as school closures and
working from home) that aimed at curbing the spread of the virus (Ingram, Maciejewski, and Hand
2020; Zhao et al. 2020). The compression of daily life contexts to one’s immediate family and
home space has also intensified feelings of stress by cutting people off from important sources of
happiness, well-being, and support (Marroquín, Vine, and Morgan 2020).
Our study focuses on how the pandemic has affected the stress levels of adult women caring
and not caring for minor household children (to which we will refer to as “mothers” and “nonmothers”). We do so because despite increasing popularity of gender equality ideologies, women
continue to take on the bulk of domestic responsibilities such as housework and childcare (Bianchi
et al. 2000, 2012; Negraia, Augustine, and Prickett 2018). Therefore, when life is confined mostly
at home during this pandemic, women in general, but women caring for minor children in
particular are likely to juggle many responsibilities, putting their mental health at risk. Using
primary data from the Assessing the Social Consequences of COVID-19 (ASCC) study, we
explore how women’s stress levels have changed during the COVID-19 pandemic relative to the
pre-pandemic period, making comparisons between mothers and non-mothers. We pay special
attention to how the association between mothering and change in stress during the pandemic
varies by women’s employment status.

Scholarship from across disciplines suggests that parenting is a “mixed-bag” associated
with costs but also with benefits for one’s emotional well-being (for a review see Nomaguchi and
Milkie 2020). Studies conducted during pre-pandemic times suggest that mothers enjoy certain
childcare activities, but overall experience higher level of stress than women not raising children
(Glass, Simon, and Andersson 2016; Musick, Meier, and Flood 2016; Negraia and Augustine 2020;
Nomaguchi and Milkie 2017; Umberson, Pudrovska, and Reczek 2010). Mothers’ higher stress
relative to non-mothers’ may have changed during the pandemic because of the daily life
adjustments it has brought about. For example, during the pandemic, mothers spend more time at
home with children, which may have amplified the benefits of parenting and sheltered mothers
from the associated stress of time-deficit with children (Milkie, Nomaguchi, and Schieman 2019;
Roxburgh 2012). At the same time, the pandemic may have also exacerbated mothers’ feelings of
stress by increasing childcare demands (Heggeness and Fields 2020).
We focus on how women’s paid work hours and employment status moderate the
association between mothering and stress change during the pandemic for two reasons. First, prior
work has shown that full-time employment is beneficial to women’s mental health (Caputo,
Pavalko, and Hardy 2020; Frech and Damaske 2012; Meier et al. 2016; Pavalko and Smith 1999;
Ross and Mirowsky 1995), but long working hours and limited work schedule control can also
fuel work-family conflicts affecting stress levels of women raising children (Carrillo et al. 2017;
Marshall and Tracy 2009; Milkie et al. 2019; Roxburgh 2012). Second, women’s working
conditions and employment status are prone to change during times of crisis like the COVID-19
pandemic (Collins et al. 2021; Heggeness and Fields 2020; Landivar et al. 2020). Therefore, when
aiming to compare the effect of this pandemic on mothers’ and non-mothers’ mental health, it is
important to do so in the context of their employment conditions.

Understanding if and how the COVID-19 pandemic may have affected mothers’ feelings
of stress can inform efforts to buffer the negative effects of COVID-19 restrictions on mothers’
mental health, which are also relevant for the physical and mental health outcomes of their children
(Diener et al. 2017; McQuillan and Bates 2017). Similarly, as a growing share of women delay or
opt out of parenting (Lesthaeghe 2010), understanding how the pandemic may have impacted the
stress levels of women not raising children will inform scholarship addressing the mental health
needs of this growing demographic. The change of work and family life during the pandemic also
provides opportunities to better explore the “costs and benefits” of parenting, and understand the
mechanisms through which paid employment influences women’s mental health.

BACKGROUND
Linkages Between the Parenting Role and Adults’ Mental Health
Despite widespread popular beliefs among U.S. adults that raising children brings fulfillment and
happiness to people’s lives (Hansen 2012), empirical research depicts a more complex picture of
the relationship between parenting and well-being. On average, both mothers and fathers fare
worse than adults not raising children across dimensions of mental health such as stress, fatigue,
depression, and overall life satisfaction (Glass et al. 2016; Margolis and Myrskylä 2011;
McLanahan and Adams 1987; Negraia and Augustine 2020; Umberson et al. 2010). However,
analyses of positive emotions tied to daily activities have also found that parenting is associated
with more happiness and meaning than non-parenting (Musick et al. 2016; Negraia and Augustine
2020; Nelson et al. 2013; Offer 2014). Taking these findings together, scholars conceptualize the
parenting role as being a “mixed bag” of both “demands and rewards” for adults’ well-being
(Nomaguchi and Milkie 2020).

Pre-pandemic Studies on Parenting and Mental Health. Parenting can be a source of
positive self-worth, happiness, meaning, and purpose in adults’ lives (Nelson, Kushlev, and
Lyubomirsky 2014). This is in part because parenting offers adults opportunities to pursue valuable
goals such as providing care and education to children, as well as a chance to contribute positively
to society because children constitute its future. Moreover, children can also be amusing to be
around. Recent time-use research have found that parents perceive their time with children as
meaningful, and the happiest of their day (Musick et al. 2016; Nelson et al. 2013; Offer 2014).
Nevertheless, parenting also brings about demands and challenges, linked to the emotional,
time, and financial commitments of raising children (Pollmann-Schult 2014), which can be a
source of stress and fatigue (Negraia and Augustine 2020). The costs of parenting to adults’
emotional well-being are higher for mothers than for fathers (Musick et al. 2016; Offer 2014). This
is because women continue to be the primary caregiver and take on more tiring and stressful
activities like routine childcare (i.e., feeding, bathing, and dressing) than men do (Musick et al.
2016; Negraia, Yavorsky, and Dukhovnov 2020). Further, the ideologies of “intensive parenting”
and “concerted cultivation” have also made mothering increasingly stressful. By emphasizing
mothers’ formative role in children’s development and well-being, these parenting ideologies
encourage activities that demand high levels of energy and time such as organizing children’s
extracurricular activities and fostering children’s skills to interact with social institutions
(Gunderson and Barrett 2017; Hays 1996; Lareau 2011; Rizzo, Schiffrin, and Liss 2013).
Parenting and Mental Health during COVID-19. Recent studies have observed a
deterioration of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic among adults raising children, but
also within the general population (Gassman-Pines, Ananat, and Fitz-Henley 2020; McGinty et al.
2020). However, little is known about whether and how the impacts of the pandemic on women’s

mental health, especially stress levels, may vary by the presence of minor children at home.
Because the parenting role, and more so the mothering role, is associated with both rewards and
demands for adult’s well-being, the abrupt changes to individual’s daily routines brought on by
the COVID-19 pandemic may differently impact the stress levels of mothers and non-mothers.
For women raising children, the pandemic may have amplified the fulfilment and happiness
that parenting brings because they get to spend more time at home with their children during the
periods of social distancing (Heggeness and Fields 2020; Kochhar 2020). Mothers may have also
strengthened the emotional ties with their children during the pandemic, which may shelter them
from the feelings of isolation (Evans et al. 2020). Moreover, some of the stressors associated with
intensive mothering practices such as chauffeuring, attending children’s events, and arranging
playdates may have declined as extracurricular activities, social events, and gatherings came to a
halt. However, the closures of care facilities and schools have also led to growing demands of
childcare and homeschooling, which may cost mothers more time, emotional energy, and physical
energy, potentially leading to greater stress for them. Mothers spending more time together with
children may have also increased opportunities for parent-child conflicts (Evans et al. 2020).
Women not raising children are not stressed by the growing childcare demands during the
pandemic. Yet, they may still experience a greater increase in stress relative to mothers due to the
lack of family and social support. Parenting enables adults to strengthen their ties with extended
family members and neighbors who can provide help in times of need (Gallagher and Gerstel 2001;
Kalmijn 2012; Nomaguchi and Milkie 2003). Therefore, compared to mothers, the pandemic and
the stay-at-home order may set more restrictions on the emotional and social support available to
non-mothers. During pre-pandemic periods, adults not raising children enjoy more leisure time
than parents (Claxton and Perry-Jenkins 2008). However, as the pandemic closed restaurants,

theaters, and put limits on outings with friends, non-mothers may have fewer sources of positive
emotions.
Linkages between the Parenting Role, Employment and Stress
A rich body of literature shows that a constellation of factors such as age, race/ethnicity,
employment, marital status, and their intersections, play a role in shaping both mothers’ and nonmothers’ stress levels (Hatch and Dohrenwend 2007; Nomaguchi and Milkie 2017, 2020). In this
project, we focus on the interaction of parenting and employment on predicting women’s stress
level changes during the pandemic. We do so because prior work has shown that employment
status has both critical and complicated impacts on the mental health of women in general, and
mothers raising children in particular (Caputo et al. 2020; Carrillo et al. 2017; Frech and Damaske
2012; Nomaguchi and Milkie 2020; Pavalko and Smith 1999; Roxburgh 2012). Also, employment
is an important life dimension that is prone to change during a crisis like the current pandemic
(Collins et al. 2021; Heggeness and Fields 2020; Landivar et al. 2020).
Pre-pandemic Studies on Parenting, Employment and Stress. Participating in paid
employment is found to benefit women’s physical and mental health by providing a source of
income, a feeling of financial security, space to develop one’s social network, and a sense of selfworth (Caputo et al. 2020; Frech and Damaske 2012; Pavalko and Smith 1999; Ross and Mirowsky
1995). Compared to part-time employment, full-time jobs can provide more resources such as
higher pay, more autonomy, opportunities for promotion, and schedule flexibility, all of which
bring about more benefits for women’s long-term well-being (Frech and Damaske 2012). However,
work characteristics, and not only employment type or work hours, also matter for women’s mental
health. Jobs characterized by low control such as part-time jobs, or high demands such as self-

employment may reduce feelings of self-efficacy and increase stress (Davis et al. 2008; Melchior
et al. 2007).
While employment status and work characteristics can affect the stress levels of women in
general, it tends to be more so for women raising children. Studies have found that employed
mothers generally report lower parenting stress than non-employed mothers (Buehler and O’Brien
2011; Meier et al. 2016; Nomaguchi and Brown 2011; Nomaguchi and Johnson 2016). However,
employment can also be a source of stress for mothers. In the U.S., the hegemonic motherhood
ideology and ideal worker norm posit employment and motherhood to be contradictory to each
other (Blair-Loy 2003; Dow 2016; Hays 1996; Moen and Roehling 2005). Parenting and working
are, therefore, competing for mothers’ limited resources, leading to work-family conflicts. For
instance, low-wage workers’ long work hours and limited control over one’s work schedule
complicates childcare arrangements, resulting in high stress among mothers (Carrillo et al. 2017;
Kelly et al. 2014; Milkie et al. 2019; Roxburgh 2012). Also, as the boundaries between work and
non-work time of professional jobs become more blurred, working mothers may feel inadequate
and deficient in their time spent with children, which also increases mothers’ stress levels (Bianchi
2011).
Parenting, Employment and Stress during COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has
triggered significant changes in women’s work and family life. Many employed women, especially
those who were full-time employed in higher income jobs, began working from home in order to
curb the spread of the virus (Pew Research Center 2020b). For working mothers, working from
home may to some extent alleviate work-family conflicts caused by long commutes to work and
schedule conflicts between themselves and children. Transitioning into remote working during the
early days of the pandemic may have also temporarily decreased mothers’ workloads and work

hours, allowing them to spend more time with their children, who were also staying at home due
to school closures. However, as children spending more time at home, mothers may be struggling
even more to find balance between their competing responsibilities, which now includes not only
their own job, housework, and childcare, but also homeschooling. A recent report shows that
during the pandemic, about 37 percent of mothers parenting children younger than 12 found it
difficult to handle childcare responsibilities (Pew Research Center 2020b). This percentage is
likely to be higher for mothers who continued working for pay during the pandemic. Yet, as
mentioned above, paid employment, especially full-time employment, can provide women
material, psychological, and social resources that benefit their mental health. These resources may
help working mothers cope with the sudden life changes and stress increases during the pandemic.
For non-mothers, working during the pandemic may be more stressful compared to the prepandemic era if they can no longer tap into the social support and leisure activities that they used
to rely on for coping with work related stress. Yet, not working or experiencing reduced work
hours during the pandemic may also exacerbate non-mothers’ feelings of social isolation, hence
increase their stress levels.
Despite the rapid increase of remote working, not all jobs can be done at home. People
with lower education and income are less likely to work from home than their more privileged
counterparts (Pew Research Center 2020b). This means many women, especially those doing lowskilled part-time jobs, may still need to be physically present at the workplace and bear the risk of
infection. Further, starting from the early stages of the pandemic, about 28 percent of adults
reported that at least one household member was laid off or lost their jobs (Pew Research Center
2020a). Unlike the economic recessions of past decades, which had more negative impacts on
men’s employment, the sky-high unemployment caused by social distancing has largely impacted

female concentrated sectors and occupations (Alon et al. 2020; Landivar et al. 2020). Even when
having a stable job, in direct response to the pandemic, many mothers have to “opt-out” of
employment or reduce their work hours in order to cope with increasing domestic and childcare
demands (Collins et al. 2021; Landivar et al. 2020; Stone 2008). Experiencing financial loss due
to reduced work hours or working with high infection risks may cause greater stress increases for
mothers than for non-mothers because mothers also worry about their children’s well-being. The
closure of schools and daycare centers during the pandemic may also make childcare arrangements
even more challenging for mothers who cannot work from home.
The Present Study
This study sets to examine the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on women’s mental health at
the intersection of parenting and employment status. Drawing on the previous literature, we
anticipate that both mothers’ and non-mothers’ stress levels have changed following the onset of
the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, the levels of stress change that mothers and non-mothers have
experienced should vary by their employment status. However, we remain agnostic about the
expected direction of these changes because, as discussed above, the impacts of the pandemic on
the mothers’ and non-mothers’ work and family life are complex, on-going, and yet to be fully
understood. For this reason, we do not formulate formal hypotheses, but raise the following
research questions:
1. Have stress levels of adult women raising minor household children, and those not
raising children, changed during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to pre-COVID-19
periods? If so, how?
2. Does the association between mothering and change in stress during the COVID-19
pandemic vary by women’s employment conditions?

Drawing on data from the Assessing the Social Consequences of COVID-19 (ASCC) study,
our examinations of these questions make several contributions to the research of women’s mental
health during times of health crises. First, the ASCC data contain women’s self-reports of their
stress levels both prior to and during the pandemic, allowing us to measure women’s selfperception of how their feelings of stress have changed following the pandemic outbreak. Second,
the ASCC data also include women’s weekly work hours and employment status before and during
the pandemic, making it possible to pinpoint the effects of not only employment status, but also
change of employment on women’s stress levels at the intersection with their parenting status.
Third, exploring these questions can deepen our interpretations of to what extent and under what
conditions can parenting and paid employment benefit women’s mental health. The change of
work and family life during the pandemic provides opportunities to better understand the “demands
and rewards” of parenting, as well as the mechanisms through which paid employment influences
women’s feelings of stress.
Overall, our research highlights the need to consider how periods of health crisis like the
COVID-19 pandemic affects women’s mental health. We uncover multiple ways in which
parenting and employment may buffer mental health risks for women.

DATA AND METHODS
Data
We used data from the second wave of the Assessing the Social Consequences of COVID-19
(ASCC) study. ASCC is part of a larger project that collects information on Americans’ social
behaviors and attitudes before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents were
recruited using Prolific, a crowdsourcing platform used by scholars and market analysts to recruit

study participants. Although the sample is not nationally representative, Prolific has been found to
produce high quality data using traditional metrics such as satisficing and attention checks, and
the sample’s ability to reproduce well-documented effects in prior studies (Peer et al. 2017). We
use the second wave of the study because it contains a larger sample size (compared to the first
wave), which allows us to conduct more detailed statistical analyses. The second wave of ASCC
collected data from 3,108 respondents between April 7 and May 15, 2020. We restricted the sample
to women aged 18 to 60 years old (N=1,730) to limit the share of non-mothers who may be empty
nesters (a limitation shared by other studies on mothers’ well-being such as Glass et al. 2016). This
sample restriction also limits the share of elderly women caring for minor grandchildren, whose
parenting experiences and mental health may be different from that of younger women raising
their own children. Due to the low amount of missing data on our dependent and independent
variables (ranging from 1.97 to 2.54 percent), we used listwise deletion rather than multiple
imputation techniques (Allison 2001; Pepinsky 2018). The final study sample consists of 1,647
women: 395 women living with their own minor children (mothers), and 1,252 women who did
not coreside with any minor children (non-mothers) during the pandemic.
Measures
Dependent Variables: Women’s Stress Levels. Our three key outcome measures captured
respondents’ self-reported stress levels prior to, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the change
of stress levels between these two periods. Using a scale from 0 to 10 (with higher scores indicating
higher stress), the survey asked respondents to report their current levels of stress (during the
COVID-19 pandemic or Time 2) and retrospect their stress levels before the pandemic (Time 1).
Using these two measures of respondents’ stress levels, we then calculated an indicator for the

change in women’s stress levels after the pandemic outbreak (Time 2 - Time 1); positive values
indicate an increase in women’ stress levels.
Independent Variables. Our first key independent variable was women’s parenting status,
operationalized as 1= “mothers” if women reported living with their own children younger than
18 years old, and 0= “non-mothers” if they report not living with minor household children. The
second independent variable was women’s employment conditions, captured using a categorical
measure of work hours per week during the pandemic: 0= “35 hours or more” (working full-time);
1= “1-34 hours” (working part-time); 2= “0 hours” (not working). For robustness checking, we
also included an indicator of women’s employment status during the pandemic, coded into five
mutually exclusive categories: 1= “full-time”, 2= “part-time”, 3= “self-employed”, 4=
“furloughed”, and 5= “not in the labor market”. We also constructed a variable using women’s
weekly work hours before and during the pandemic to measure the change in women’s work hours
after the pandemic outbreak: 1= “always worked full-time”, 2= “always worked part-time”, 3=
“always non-employed”, 4= “from full-time to part-time or non-employed”, 5= “from part-time to
non-employed”, and 6= “from part-time or non-employed to full-time employed”.
Covariates. Models included relevant covariates for women’s: occupation, number of
household children aged between 0-5, 6-12, and 13-17 (continuous), marital status (dummy
coded as: married, engaged, single, divorced/separated/widowed, and other status), race/ethnicity
(dummy coded as: White, Hispanic, Black, Asian, and Other race/ethnicity), age, education level,
household income (all measured continuously), change in family income during the pandemic
(dummy coded as: decreased, stayed the same, increased), and home ownership (dummy coded as:
own with mortgage, own in full, rented, and occupied). Spouse’s education level and employment

status were controlled for women who coresided with their spouse/partner (coded as 0 if no
spouse/partner presented).
Analytic Strategies
The first aim of this paper was to compare how mothers’ and non-mothers’ stress levels have
changed during the COVID-19 pandemic relative to pre-pandemic periods. To do so, we ran
ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models with women’s parenting status (reference group:
non-mothers) as the independent variable. We ran the models three times to predict each of our
dependent variables: 1) women’s stress levels before the pandemic, 2) during the pandemic, and
3) the change of their stress levels after the pandemic outbreak. The second aim of this project was
to explore whether the association between mothering status and levels of stress change during the
pandemic varied by women’s employment status. We did so by including interaction terms
between women’s parenting status and their 1) weekly work hours, 2) employment status during
the pandemic, and 3) the change of work hours after the pandemic outbreak in three separate OLS
regression models. The analysis was conducted in STATA 15.

RESULTS
Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics (means and percentages) for mothers and non-mothers’
sociodemographic characteristics, as well as their stress levels and employment conditions prior
to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Not controlling for the covariates that we described above,
we found that the stress levels of mothers and non-mothers had both increased during the pandemic,
but to a lesser extent among mothers. Regarding their employment conditions, the work hours and
employment status of mothers and non-mothers during the pandemic were similar, however a

higher percentage of non-mothers, than mothers, were furloughed (9.03 percent vs. 6.08 percent).
This may be because non-mothers, who were younger than mothers (average age 30 vs. 36 years
old), were more likely to work in recession-prone jobs. We also found that among both mothers
and non-mothers, more than 60 percent of them maintained their pre-pandemic employment status.
Yet, still over 35 percent of them experienced reduced work hours and changed either from
working full-time to working part-time/not working, or from working part-time to not working.
Within this group, we found that a higher percentage of mothers, compared to non-mothers (24.30
percent vs. 20.77 percent), changed from working full-time to working part-time/not working. A
very small share of mothers (1.52 percent) and non-mothers (2.24 percent) reported work hours
increases (i.e., from working part-time/not working to working full-time or from not working to
working part-time) after the pandemic outbreak.

Parenting and Stress Level Changes During the COVID-19 Pandemic
Results from OLS regression models (Model 1 in Table 2, and Figure 1) show that before the
pandemic, mothers reported significantly higher levels of stress than non-mothers. During the
pandemic (Model 2 in Table 2), mother’s stress level was still higher than that for non-mothers,
but the difference was no longer statistically significant. When using the change in stress levels
before and during the pandemic as the dependent variable (Model 3 in Table 2), we found no
significant difference between mothers and non-mothers. Therefore, although non-mothers seem
to experience greater stress increases than mothers during the pandemic, we found no evidence

The Role of Employment for Women’ Stress Level Changes During the COVID-19 Pandemic
Next, we tested if the relationship between women’s parenting status and their levels of stress
change varied depending on their employment conditions. We first present results from the OLS
regression models where we included an interaction term between women’s mothering status and
their weekly work hours during the pandemic. As shown in Model 1 of Table 3 and Figure 2,
among women who worked 35 hours or more per week during the pandemic, mothers experienced
a .28 unit increase in stress level compared with the pre-pandemic era. This is significantly lower
than the 1.11 units increase that non-mothers faced. Among women who worked fewer than 35
hours per week or did not work for pay, mothers and non-mothers experienced similar levels of

stress increase during the pandemic. Therefore, mothers experienced smaller stress increases than
non-mothers only when they worked full-time (35 hours or more per week). Further, the stress
increase that full-time working mothers reported was also significantly smaller than that of mothers
and non-mothers who did not work, and marginally significantly smaller than that of part-time
working mothers and non-mothers (Model 1 Appendix A). In sum, although both mothers and
non-mothers experienced stress increases during the pandemic, the association between women’s
parenting status and their levels of stress increase was conditioned by women’s work hours.

To check the robustness of the results presented above, we also ran the model with an
interaction term between women’s parenting status and a more detailed measure of employment
status, discerning between women who were: full-time employed, part-time employed, selfemployed, furloughed or not in the labor force (Model 2 in Table 3, and Figure 3). The results
were similar to those obtained from models examining the effects of weekly work hours.
Specifically, full-time employed mothers reported significantly smaller increases in stress during
the pandemic than full-time employed non-mothers. We observed a similar stress changing pattern
for self-employed and furloughed women. In contrast, among women who were employed parttime or not in the labor force, there was no significant difference in stress increase levels by

mothering status. Compared with weekly work hours, the employment status variable can provide
a complementary measure of women’s employment condition, and allows us to distinguish
between women working 0 hours per week due to being furloughed or non-employed. However,
because the small sample size of mothers who were part-time employed (63), self-employed (36),
and furloughed (24) may limit the validity of our results, we only used it for robustness checking.

Lastly, we present results from models where we examined the effects of the change in
women’s work hours and employment status before and during the pandemic, more specifically
among women who: always worked full-time, always worked part-time, always non-employed,
changed from full-time to part-time/non-employed, changed from part-time to non-employed, and

from part-time/non-employed to full-time or from part-time to full-time (Model 3 in Table 3, and
Figure 4). We found that mothers who worked full-time (35 hours or more per week) both before
and during the pandemic experienced a .23 unit increase in stress, which is significantly lower than
their peers not raising children (1.13 units). A similar pattern was observed among women who
shifted from full-time (35 hours/week or more) to part-time (1-34 hours/week)/not working (0
hour/week) following the pandemic onset. Whereas, among women who worked part-time or did
not work for pay both before and during the pandemic, as well as those who changed from parttime working to not working during the pandemic, mothers and non-mothers experienced similar
levels of stress increase. Results (not shown) also suggest that when mothers changed from parttime employment/non-employment to full-time employment, they reported higher stress increases
than non-mothers. But the sample size for this group (28 non-mothers and 6 mothers) made the
validity of this result questionable. Among women with different mothering and employment
statuses, mothers who worked full-time both before and during the pandemic fared relatively better
and faced significantly smaller stress increases than women in most other groups, except mothers
and non-mothers who continued working part-time and mothers who shifted from full-time to parttime employment (Model 3 in Appendix A).

DISCUSSION
Using primary data from the second wave of Assessing the Social Consequences of COVID-19
(ASCC) study, we find evidence that although mothers and non-mothers both experience stress
increase following the pandemic outbreak, the association between mothering status and the
increase in women’s feelings of stress is conditioned by their weekly work hours and employment
status. Specifically, among women who work full-time during the pandemic, mothers experience
smaller stress increases than non-mothers following the pandemic onset. Whereas, among parttime employed and non-employed women, mothers and non-mothers report similar levels of stress

increase. Besides, full-time working mothers face smaller stress increases than women with other
parenting and employment statuses, particularly mothers and non-mothers who are not employed
during the pandemic. Further, reducing one’s work hours after the pandemic outbreak seems to
have limited impacts on the pattern of stress change. Mothers who work full-time before the
pandemic report smaller increases in stress than their peers not raising children, regardless of
whether they continue working full-time during the pandemic or not. Among women who work
part-time before the pandemic, mothers report similar levels of stress increase as non-mothers no
matter whether they stop working after the pandemic outbreak or not.
Although women experience stress increases during the pandemic regardless of their
mothering or employment status, full-time working mothers seem to fare relatively better and face
smaller stress increases, especially when compared with their peers not raising children and
women (both mothers and non-mothers) who are not employed during the pandemic. In the early
days of the pandemic, many full-time employed mothers may have experienced a temporary
decrease in paid work hours and workloads due to the transition to remoting working (Collins et
al. 2021; Landivar et al. 2020). Reducing employment workloads to make space for increasing
domestic demands and childcare responsibilities during the pandemic may have also become more
acceptable in workplace compared to pre-pandemic times. These may relieve some of the workfamily conflicts that full-time employed mothers face, allowing them to engage more with children
and perhaps get more sleep and leisure, which are found to be effective in reducing mothers’
parental stress (Bianchi 2011; Kelly et al. 2014; Marshall and Tracy 2009; Milkie et al. 2019;
Schnittker 2007). Further, following the closure of schools and day care facilities in response to
the pandemic, children are spending most of their time at home. Children being at home can
increase mothers’ burden from childcare and homeschooling (Heggeness and Fields 2020;

Kochhar 2020). Yet, it may also eliminate some of the schedule conflicts between mothers and
children, and reduce the amount of activities associated with intensive mothering such as
chauffeuring, attending children’s extracurricular events, and arranging activities and playdates,
all of which can be sources of stress for mothers (Gunderson and Barrett 2017; Milkie et al. 2019;
Nomaguchi, Milkie, and Bianchi 2005; Rizzo et al. 2013). During the early days of the pandemic,
when these data were collected, the mental health of full-time employed mothers, especially their
stress levels may still be benefiting from the temporary reduction of work-family conflicts. The
rewards of mothering may have also been amplified because mothers can spend more meaningful
time engaging with their children (Musick et al. 2016; Negraia and Augustine 2020; Offer 2014).
Compared to mothers employed full-time, similarly employed non-mothers are less likely
to reduce their work hours during the pandemic due to domestic responsibilities (Heggeness and
Fields 2020; Landivar et al. 2020). Many of them may have even taken extra workloads because
of the lay-offs and reduced hours of other workers, and hence experience more work-related stress
than pre-pandemic times. Although potentially facing great stress from work, non-mothers may
not receive as much emotional and social support during the pandemic as mothers do. Prior work
shows that parenting can strengthen adults’ ties with extended family members and neighbors who
can provide help in times of difficulty (Gallagher and Gerstel 2001; Kalmijn 2012; Nomaguchi
and Milkie 2003), which means compared with mothers, women not raising children may have
fewer others to rely on during the pandemic. Besides, the cancellation of social events and the
closure of entertainment venues following the pandemic onset may also restrict non-mothers’
access to friends and leisure activities that they used to rely on for coping with stress in prepandemic times. Therefore, working long hours without the “usual” leisure outlets during the
pandemic may be especially stressful for non-mothers.

Other possible explanations for the small stress increases among full-time employed
mothers during the pandemic include their high pre-pandemic stress levels and stress coping
abilities. We find that before the pandemic onset, full-time employed mothers tend to report higher
levels of stress than non-mothers, and mothers of other employment status (results not shown).
Full-time employed mothers, who during non-pandemic times need to juggle many responsibilities
in order to meet the demands of full-time employment and parenting, may be better equipped via
their previous experiences to deal with the sudden increase of stressors during a crisis like the
COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the complex relationship between employment and mothers’
mental well-being, existing studies do generally show that maternal employment can provide
economic, psychological, and social resources that are beneficial to mothers’ emotional well-being
(Blair-Loy 2003; Meier et al. 2016; Nomaguchi and Brown 2011; Nomaguchi and Johnson 2016;
Nomaguchi and Milkie 2020). Therefore, having more already-established strategies and resources
for coping with stress in situations of crisis may also be a reason why full-time employed mothers’
feelings of stress are less negatively affected by the pandemic than non-mothers and part-time or
non-employed mothers. This same mechanism may also explain why among women who shift
from working full-time to working part-time or not working after the pandemic outbreak, mothers
still experience smaller stress increases than non-mothers.
Economic difficulties and perceived financial strains may be one of the reasons why parttime and non-employed mothers, particularly the latter ones experienced more stress increases than
full-time working mothers during the pandemic. Prior literature shows that employment can
benefit women’s well-being through a variety of mechanisms, one of which is by providing
economic security (Frech and Damaske 2012; Marshall and Tracy 2009; Pavalko and Smith 1999;
Ross and Mirowsky 1995; Schnittker 2007). Thus, employed women may be less vulnerable to the

financial difficulties caused by the pandemic than women who are unemployed or out of the labor
force. Similarly, among employed women, those working part-time may have encountered higher
financial difficulties compared to full-time employed women given that, in the U.S., part-time jobs
tend to pay lower wages, provide fewer benefits, and have higher risk of termination than full-time
jobs (Frech and Damaske 2012; Kalleberg, Reskin, and Hudson 2000). While we argued above
that spending time with children may play a protective role for mothers’ mental health in times of
crisis, this may only be valid for mothers who have full-time jobs. For part-time and non-employed
mothers, the fear of encountering financial difficulties and not being able to provide for children’s
and families’ needs may increase their feelings of stress.
Our models have controlled for house ownership, family income, as well as change in
family income during the pandemic, meaning that subjective perception of potential financial
strains and unemployment risks is likely an important source of part-time and non-employed
mother’s stress. This may also explain why furloughed mothers report similar levels of stress
increases as full-time working mothers, when out of the labor market mothers report significantly
greater stress increases than full-time employed mothers. The expectations that jobs and income
will return in the near future may make women worry less about financial difficulties (Chandola
et al. 2020).
We also find that the reduction of work hours during the pandemic, namely changing from
working full-time to working part-time/not working, or from working part-time to not working,
has limited impacts on the pattern of stress change. This finding contradicts prior studies which
have shown that the interruption of full-time employment is detrimental to women’s future career
development and long-term well-being (Caputo et al. 2020; Frech and Damaske 2012; Marshall
and Tracy 2009; Pavalko and Smith 1999; Schnittker 2007). We attribute this seeming

contradiction to the timing of the data collection for our study, which took place during the early
months of the pandemic (between April 7 and May 15, 2020), when knowledge about the length
of the pandemic or its economic effects was limited. The long-term consequences of reduced work
hours on mothers’ and non-mothers’ mental well-being may not have shown up at the early stages
of the pandemic when people still hoped for a fast rebound and governmental financial support.
To sum up, although women in general experience increases in stress after the pandemic
outbreak, full-time working mothers fare relatively better. They report smaller stress increases
compared with full-time working non-mothers, as well as mothers and non-mothers who are parttime or non-employed during the pandemic. These results suggest that during times of crisis such
as a pandemic outbreak, full-time employment may protect mothers’ mental health, possibly
through providing financial security and sufficient childcare resources, offering mothers
capabilities to cope with the stress caused by sudden life changes, and giving them meaningful
things to do (paid work and spending time with children) to take their mind off from the threat of
the pandemic. However, full-time employment and long paid working hours do not seem to benefit
non-mothers’ mental health during the pandemic. Full-time working non-mothers experience
similar, if not higher levels of stress increase compared with their peers with other employment
status.
Certain limitations of this study are worth noting. First, the mental health consequences of
the COVID-19 pandemic that we observed in this study may only be short-term because the data
we used were collected during the early months of the pandemic (April 7 and May 15, 2020). As
the pandemic spiraled out of control, the stress levels of women with different mothering and
employment status may have changed. For example, full-time employed mothers may have
encountered more work-family conflicts when workloads resumed, and homeschooling burdens

also rose. We have just finished data collection for the third wave of ASCC. Once the data becomes
ready to use, it will be possible to study how women’s stress levels have changed half a year after
the outbreak of the pandemic.
Second, the generalizability of our results is limited by the fact that the ASCC data is not
nationally representative, and the sample size of mothers raising minor children is relatively small
(395 mothers vs. 1,249 non-mothers). Studies using nationally representative data and larger
samples should replicate these analyses. The small sample size also limits our ability to pinpoint
the mechanisms behind why women with different parenting and employment status experience
different levels of stress increase. For example, we have observed social class differences between
mothers and non-mothers. Future research should explore to what extent full-time employed
mothers’ smaller stress increases can be attributed to their higher socioeconomic status such as
higher household income and employment within higher prestige occupations.
Despite these limitations, our study is among the first to provide empirical evidence that
the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on women vary depending on their
parenting and employment statuses. Mothering is associated with smaller stress increases during
the pandemic, but only when combined with full-time working. Thus, providing part-time working
and non-employed mothers more childcare resources and increasing their stress coping strategies
may help lower stress levels for these groups. Compared with full-time working mothers, women
not raising minor children in general experience more severe mental health deterioration during
the pandemic, and full-time employment does not seem to be effective in buffering this
deterioration. We interpret these findings as a call for more family and social support to shelter
women not raising children from the negative mental health consequences of the pandemic. We

also call for more systematic analysis to explore the determinants of the mental health of women
not raising children during the pandemic.
