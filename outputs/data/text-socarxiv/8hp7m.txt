Abstract
Academia serves as a valuable case for studying the effects of social forces on workplace productivity, using a concrete
measure of output: scholarly papers. Many academics, especially women, have experienced unprecedented challenges
to scholarly productivity during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The authors analyze the gender
composition of more than 450,000 authorships in the arXiv and bioRxiv scholarly preprint repositories from before
and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis reveals that the underrepresentation of women scientists in the last
authorship position necessary for retention and promotion in the sciences is growing more inequitable. The authors
find differences between the arXiv and bioRxiv repositories in how gender affects first, middle, and sole authorship
submission rates before and during the pandemic. A review of existing research and theory outlines potential mechanisms
underlying this widening gender gap in productivity during COVID-19. The authors aggregate recommendations for
institutional change that could ameliorate challenges to women’s productivity during the pandemic and beyond.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has
caused myriad social changes throughout society, including
in the academy. Reports of reduced productivity for faculty
members, both anecdotal and data-driven, draw attention to
the fact that the ivory tower is not immune from shocks to
our most essential social systems. In fact, because of the
clear metrics of productivity in faculty careers, academia
makes for an excellent case study of how an exogenous
shock affects institutional practices.
Many of these changes are disproportionately affecting
the productivity of women academics.1 Women academics
have faced disproportionate work-life balance challenges
during the pandemic and are more likely to have reduced
their research hours than men (Deryugina, Shurchkov, and
Stearns 2021; Myers et al. 2020). There are several possible
reasons for this. Because the COVID-19 pandemic has
resulted in widespread school and daycare closures, many
academics are or have been working from home with their
children underfoot. More likely to be in dual-academic

relationships, women scientists have fewer supports at home
than men, who are more likely to have partners who do not
work full-time for pay. At work, women faculty are likely to
perform more service, exert more emotional labor, and spend
more time transitioning to online learning. Our study contributes to the research base on women academics’ reduced
productivity during the COVID-19 pandemic by integrating
data analysis of gender gaps in preprint submissions with a
theoretical discussion of possible mechanisms for these
differences.
We quantify the effects of these structural and societal
changes on women’s productivity by analyzing data on preprint submissions in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math). Although there has been significant progress
closing the gender gap in these fields, STEM remains one of
the most gender unequal realms of the academy (Hill,

Corbett, and St. Rose 2010). Furthermore, scientific fields
have power, authority, and status in our modern society—as
do the scientists who work in them (Fox, Whittington, and
Linkova 2017). The demographics of those who produce
knowledge shape not only the knowledge that is produced
(Campbell et al. 2013) but also the characteristics of people
society views as powerful and important. The persistence of
gender inequality in STEM is symbolically and materially
representative of how social structures influence opportunities for professional women.
To analyze the effects of the societal changes wrought by
the pandemic on scientific productivity, we examine arXiv
and bioRxiv, two preprint servers that together cover most
STEM fields, including biology, physics, math, computer
science, and statistics, among others. A preprint is a version
of an academic paper that is posted online for public consumption prior to or concurrent with the formal peer-review
process. Several discipline-specific preprint repositories
exist, and these play an important role in the dissemination
of research (Berg et al. 2016; Freese and King 2018). Unlike
manuscripts undergoing the peer-review process, preprints
are posted online within a week of submission (and usually
the next day) (arXiv 2021; bioRxiv 2021). Two thirds of
bioRxiv preprints are published in peer-reviewed journals
within two years (Abdill and Blekhman 2019). The prevalence of preprints is on the rise throughout many disciplines
(Abdill and Blekhman 2019; Penfold and Polka 2020), and
because peer review takes time, preprints may offer a better
real-time measure of the pandemic’s effect on academic productivity than published articles in scholarly journals.
Preliminary evidence also suggests a growing importance
for preprints during the pandemic, as there is a high demand
for rapid research to understand COVID-19 (Fraser et al.
2020).
Understanding the effects of the pandemic on productivity is important because, despite substantial gains over the
past few decades, women remain significantly underrepresented in faculty positions, particularly tenured positions
(Snyder, de Brey, and Dillow 2019) and especially so in
STEM fields (Burrelli 2008; Fox 2001). And more highly
educated women in the United States are now becoming
mothers than in the past, suggesting that the childcare crisis
brought on by the pandemic may have widespread effects
within academia; 80 percent of women with doctorates or
professional degrees aged 40 and older are mothers, up from
65 percent only 20 years ago (Livingston 2018). Even before
the pandemic, women were already more likely to leave
full-time STEM employment after the birth of a first child
(Cech and Blair-Loy 2019). Ignoring the disproportionate
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on women’s productivity risks backsliding on substantial progress for academic
diversity (Woolston 2020). In addition to being an institutional goal for many organizations, gender diversity can also
increase scientific discovery and innovation (Nielsen et al.
2017).

We continue by reviewing why studying academic publishing during the pandemic provides a valuable case for analyzing shocks to social support. In a section on possible
explanations, we review existing work on structural features
of academia and households that might contribute to the productivity patterns we observe. Next, we analyze data from
two preprint repositories to assess the gendered publication
gap in STEM during the pandemic. We conclude with recommendations for university policy.

A Case Study in Shocks to Professional Support:
Productivity during the Pandemic
Not only does the pandemic have the potential to affect the
careers of a generation of scholars, it also provides an important natural experiment in the disruption of work-life routines that have been carefully designed to accommodate
institutional demands. This dramatic shift in routine serves
as an instrumental variable, allowing a unique view into the
society-wide dynamics of work-life previously accessible
only through shocks to individual lives (Newhouse and
McClellan 1998).
The ongoing productivity of academics and other whitecollar workers presumes a foundation of smoothly running
care work and support in the home. This support system
allows the “ideal worker” to work long hours without concern for family obligations (Misra, Lundquist, and Templer
2012). In other words, “the classic profile of an academic
career is cut to the profile of the traditional man with his
traditional wife” (Hochschild 1994:126). Those who deviate
from this ideal (by choice or necessity) are challenged with
unrealistic expectations for retention, tenure, or promotion
(Misra et al. 2012). This penalty is most powerful for women
but also affects men; traditional gender norms have negative
effects on all modern families (Sallee 2012; Wayne and
Cordeiro 2003).
Academic careers make a particularly valuable case study
because the measurement of productivity is very clear compared with other white-collar professions. Publication is a
concrete outcome with settled value in academia. Skipping
even a single year of publication significantly reduces the
citation impact of a highly productive scientist (Ioannidis,
Boyack, and Klavans 2014). Analyzing preprint productivity
provides insight into the challenges for this generation of
academics and the institutional supports underlying the productivity of professionals.
Several analyses have already assessed the differential
impact of the pandemic on men and women academics’ productivity. An analysis in economics found decreases in submissions by women authors in March and April 2020
(Shurchkov, Deryugina, and Stearns 2020). A study of 40,000
preprints from the Social Science Research Network (SSRN)
found that although total research productivity increased,
women’s productivity decreased relative to men’s, and these
effects were more pronounced among higher ranked

King and Frederickson
universities (Cui, Ding, and Zhu 2020). Another working
paper analyzing the preprint repositories medRxiv and
bioRxiv and select Springer-Nature journals showed a drop
in women’s relative publishing rates during the pandemic,
exacerbated in less wealthy countries (Muric, Lerman, and
Ferrara 2020). Another analysis of 1.2 million authors found
the largest reductions in submissions by women in the
National Bureau of Economic Research, SocArXiv,
EarthArXiv, and medRxiv repositories. In contrast, preprint
submissions by women first authors in arXiv and bioRxiv in
March and April 2020 remained steady compared with both
February 2020 and March and April 2019 (Vincent-Lamarre,
Sugimoto, and Larivière 2020a). Analysis of 60,000 journals
showed a 7 percentage point reduction in first authorships by
women in May 2020 relative to 2019 (Matthews 2020).
Additionally, studies have shown significant gender gaps in
authorship on COVID-19-related research (Amano-Patiño
et al. 2020; Andersen et al. 2020; Gabster et al. 2020; PinhoGomes et al. 2020). Only two discipline-specific analyses, in
political science and ecology, showed no gendered decreases
in productivity during the early pandemic (Dolan and
Lawless 2020; Fox and Meyer 2021). Most of these studies
were not yet peer reviewed at the time of writing, and many
draw on limited data. Nonetheless, they provide insight into
the gap in productivity that is to come. Analyses of preprints
are warning signals as the challenges of working from home
build up and differentially affect men and women.
Here, we add to these studies by extending analyses of the
pandemic-affected period through the end of June 2020. This
provides time for preprint outputs to reflect the effect of
lockdown orders, which began in March 2020 in many parts
of the world. These data also provide a glimpse into the summer season productivity gap of academics affected by ongoing institutional changes, discussed below.
We chose to quantify the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the gender breakdown of preprint submissions to
arXiv and bioRxiv because they provide a broad sample of
STEM fields, include very large numbers of preprints, and
provide data in easily accessible formats. They also include
fields that vary in authorship order conventions. Many
authorships in the arXiv preprint repository are alphabetical
by last name (including mathematics and economics), so we
do not expect to see great discrepancies in our findings
among author positions. In contrast, author order in the biological sciences lists the primary contributor first and the
leader of the study and most senior author last (Waltman
2012). This last author position is key for promotion and tenure in the biosciences (Wren et al. 2007). Middle authors are
understood to be those who have contributed the least to the
paper (Larivière et al. 2016). Therefore, we expect to see
variation in gender gaps by author order within the bioRxiv
repository. Women have historically been underrepresented
in the prestige positions of first and last authorship (West
et al. 2013). Next, we discuss the reasons we expect to find
gender disparities increasing as a result of the pandemic.

Possible Explanations
Gender scholars have documented substantial gender
inequality in science and the academy. Although our analysis
does not allow us to distinguish among explanations for the
observed patterns, previous research on the mechanisms
underlying gender gaps in productivity can help illuminate
the trends we have observed in preprint authorships during
the pandemic.2
Long before the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple studies
assessed gender differences in research productivity among
academics, with somewhat mixed results (Long 1992; Xie
and Shauman 1998; Weisshaar 2017). Some studies found
that the gender gap in productivity has decreased over time
and disappeared in the youngest generation of researchers
(van Arensbergen, van der Weijden, and van den Besselaar
2012), suggesting that academia had been making progress
toward greater gender equity in publishing. However, women
academics are still disproportionately responsible for childcare and household work, more likely to be in dual-career
relationships with other academics, and have more service
and teaching responsibilities, all of which disproportionately
affect their research productivity.

Domestic Work and Childcare in the Pandemic
Many countries and states closed schools and childcare centers to slow the spread of COVID-19, such that 90 percent of
the world’s school-aged children were out of school on April
15, 2020, and some were still out of school through the start
of 2021. As a result, many parents have been responsible for
caring for, and often homeschooling, their children during
the pandemic, often while simultaneously expected to work
from home. A gender gap in time spent on childcare and
domestic labor is thus one possible explanation for the

2

Of course, there could be other possible mechanisms that explain
the productivity gap, though we think these are less likely given
the preponderance of the evidence. For example, perhaps there has
been a surge in preprints from some fields, and those fields happened to have more men scholars in them. This is supported by the
finding that although the proportion of women economists contributing to non-pandemic-related working paper submissions remains
stable, women economists were not becoming involved in the new
area of COVID-19 research at the same rate as men (Amano-Patiño
et al. 2020). However, although epidemiology has seen a huge
surge of preprint submissions, it is a field with relatively equal gender ratios of practitioners before the pandemic (Schisterman et al.
2017). Alternatively, women might be a part of the types of collaborations that are harder to carry out during COVID-19 restrictions. In
a similar vein, if women are disproportionately represented in laboratory-based sciences relative to theoretical work (within a given
field), they would find it harder to continue doing research during
the pandemic (Myers et al. 2020). Or perhaps there are regional
differences in the effect of COVID-19 on productivity that correlate
with gender differences in scientific field composition.

growing gap in productivity during the pandemic. This is
exacerbated by the tendency for women scientists to be partnered with another academic, while men scientists are more
likely to have partners who do not work full-time for pay.
Domestic Work and Childcare. The proportion of parents who
report sharing domestic chores equally has increased since
before the pandemic. As a result, the fraction of families in
which mothers are primarily responsible for household labor
has decreased substantially. Nonetheless, more than onequarter of mothers also report doing substantially more in
both childcare and housework as a result of the shelter-athome orders (Carlson, Petts, and Pepin 2020). The childcare
burden is even greater for single parents, who in Canada, for
example, make up 20 percent of families with children
younger than 16. Women make up 81 percent of these singleparent householders (Statistics Canada 2015).
Women scientists, on average, are less likely to have fulltime support at home, a trend that likely has been exacerbated by the pandemic. A 2008 survey found that men
academics were four times more likely to have partners who
do not work outside the home than were women academics
(Schiebinger, Henderson, and Gilmartin 2008). Layoffs and
furloughs due to the economic downturn associated with
COVID-19 have disproportionately affected women (Alon
et al. 2020; Cottom 2020). As a result, it is likely that even
more men than the 20 percent reported (in 2008, when men
were statistically more likely to be out of work) will currently have stay-at-home partners.
If anything, we expect that this disparity will only continue to increase as children stay home. When a couple is
considering who might quit or reduce work hours to accommodate increased at-home childcare demands, even an ideologically egalitarian couple is more likely to choose the
lower earner to stay home (Risman 1998).3 Nonacademic
women partners may have voluntarily stayed home or
reduced work hours more often than men during the pandemic (Alon et al. 2020; Kitchener 2020). A study using the
U.S. Current Population Survey found that during the first
outbreak of COVID-19, mothers with young children
reduced their work hours four to five times more than fathers
(Collins et al. 2020).
It has been suggested that because of historically greater
levels of gender bias in faculty hiring, women academics
may be younger on average than men academics and therefore more likely to have children at home during the
COVID-19 pandemic (Matthews 2020). However, at least in
the United States, men tenure-track professors are actually
3

The work that gets prioritized is the work that provides the core
financial stability for the household. Because women are statistically more likely to be the lower earner, this implies that women’s
productivity may be deprioritized. However, this consideration of
a spouse’s income in deciding who will quit affects only women’s
decisions to leave the labor force (Cha 2010).

more likely to have children living in the household than
same-stage women.4 In the 2017 National Science
Foundation Survey of Doctorate Recipients, 44.0 percent of
men assistant professors reported having children in their
households, compared with 40.0 percent of women assistant
professors (NSF 2019). This gap remains consistent at the
associate professor level, with 46.1 percent of men and 42.6
percent of women, and at the full professor rank, with 36.6
percent of men and 30.1 percent of women reporting children in the home. For instructors and lecturers, who are
much more likely to be women, however, the reverse is true:
39.6 percent of women and 29.5 percent of men have children at home.5 However, instructors and lecturers are likely
responsible for only a small number of preprint submissions, as their jobs focus primarily on teaching (although
some still make important, but often unpaid, contributions
to scientific research).
Because academic women typically have children fairly
late into their child-bearing years (Mason and Goulden
2004), women principal investigators are more likely to have
young children at home than women graduate students or
postdocs. In the biological sciences, last authors are generally principal investigators who head up labs, while first
authors are often graduate students or postdoctoral researchers. Therefore, in our bioRxiv data, we expect to see the
greatest gender gaps among last authors. In the arXiv repository, we expect the same to hold in the fields of physics and
computer science, in which senior authors are typically listed
last, but not in mathematics, in which authors are generally
listed alphabetically (Waltman 2012).
Women scientists are responsible for the majority of
childcare responsibilities in the home (Schiebinger and
Gilmartin 2010). Women do more than half of the childcare
in their households, while men scientists are responsible for
about a third. This is true across rank: there is little variation
among younger generations of scholars (Schiebinger and
Gilmartin 2010). Women faculty with children spend more
than 15 more hours on caregiving activities per week than
their men colleagues (Mason et al. 2005). Even among earlycareer physician-researchers funded by the National Institutes
of Health who have children, women reported spending 8.5
more hours per week on domestic work than men, controlling for spousal employment and work hours (Jolly et al.
2014). A survey of academic scientists at research
4

This is in part because women with children are more likely to
leave academia early in their careers (Mason, Wolfinger, and
Goulden 2013).

institutions revealed that although both men and women
report that work interferes with family more than the reverse,
women report more conflict in both directions (Fox, Fonseca,
and Bao 2011). As a result, in dual-earner couples, women
academics are more likely than men academics to be responsible for a majority of the household work (Schiebinger and
Gilmartin 2010). Furthermore, all these studies were conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic, when parents could
avail themselves of “normal” childcare options.
Impact of Children on Research Productivity. Prepandemic
findings on the effects of children on academic productivity
have been mixed, though the most recent studies show a negative effect of having (especially young) children at home on
women’s research productivity. Women researchers with
young children are less productive than both their men and
child-free women colleagues after controlling for other
structural factors such as research funding and collaboration
(Kyvik and Teigen 1996). Although one study showed that
women scientists with preschool-age children are more productive than either women with school-age children or
women without children, these effects disappear after controlling for other significant predictors of productivity, such
as advising responsibilities and interest in research (Fox
2005). Another longitudinal study found a one-time positive
effective of children on productivity (a possible artifact of
planning for a child). This was followed by a negative effect
on productivity growth for both men and women academics
who had a child, with a larger productivity penalty for mothers (Hunter and Leahey 2010). Men and women spend the
same overall amount of time on their paid work each week,
but faculty mothers of young children dedicate less time to
research. Compared with men assistant professors, women
assistant professors reported spending two fewer hours on
research, one additional hour on teaching, one additional
hour on mentoring and service, two and a half more hours on
housework, and two more hours on care work each week
(Misra et al. 2012).
These effects have only been exacerbated during the pandemic. During the pandemic, women faculty members are
spending even less time on research, relative to men. U.S.
and European principal investigators with young children
reported a 17 percent larger reduction in research time during
the pandemic compared with scientists without young dependents. This is separate from a 5 percent larger decline in
research time reported by women scientists, all else equal
(Myers et al. 2020). Women academics with children at
home report spending an average of half an hour less per day
than men with children and an hour less per day than their
men colleagues without children on research during the pandemic, along with increases in childcare and housework
(Deryugina et al. 2021). Of course, gender and parenthood
status are not perfectly predictive of increased caregiving

5
demands during the pandemic.6 Some men academics are
primary caregivers, and many women academics do not have
children at home. But even when men and women academics
both have young children, men’s careers are less likely to be
adversely affected (Mason et al. 2013). Caregiving adversely
affects women’s mental health more than it does men’s
(Penning and Wu 2015). Even among parents who report
splitting childcare labor evenly, the productivity cost is
higher for women (Derrick et al. 2019). On the whole, this
body of work points to a greater productivity penalty for
mothers than fathers.
Dual-Career Academics. In a special case of the first explanation, women academics are more likely than men to be in
relationships with other academics, giving them statistically
less working time on average than men academics. In the
natural sciences, 48 percent of women have academic partners compared with 35 percent of men (Schiebinger et al.
2008). Among these academic couples, 83 percent of women
scientists but only 54 percent of men scientists are coupled to
other scientists (Schiebinger et al. 2008). In dual-academic
couples, women still do a far greater share of all household
duties. However, academic women in couples with academic
men have slightly more egalitarian sharing of household
duties than academic women in other types of relationships
(Schiebinger and Gilmartin 2010).
So what does this mean for the transition to working from
home? Assume, for the sake of argument, that dual-career
academics decide to share childcare exactly equally during
the pandemic, while other couples continue a less even division of labor. This means that a greater fraction of women
than men are doing 50 percent of the childcare labor, because
48 percent of women, but only 35 percent of men scientists,
have academic partners. In our thought experiment, the
remainder of men scientists (65 percent) do less than half of
the childcare, while the remainder of women scientists (52
percent) do more than half the childcare. So on average, men
scientists are doing far less than half the childcare while
women are doing far more.7 Statistically, among all
academics, women will be less productive. Add to this the
fact that women in dual-academic couples are more likely to
6

Children are not the only people who may need more care than
usual during COVID-19. Women are generally responsible for the
majority of caretaking work for elderly relatives (Varner and Drago
2000). However, time-tracking studies have found no difference in
faculty time spent on elder care (Misra et al. 2012).
7
This computes even if we base the calculation on only those scientists with stay-at-home partners: the remainder of men scientists
(20 percent) would do less than half the childcare, with women
with stay-at-home partners (only 5 percent) doing less than half the
childcare. Note that these are not natural science–specific percentages for stay-at-home partners (Schiebinger et al. 2008).

6
place equal value on their and their partner’s careers than are
men in dual-academic couples (Schiebinger et al. 2008).
Given this imbalance, women academics may find their time
less protected than that of their partners’. Thus, even if
women scientists increasingly insist on an even division of
domestic and childcare duties in their homes, they will continue to do more than the average academic man.
Many academic men who are committed to gender equality strive to do their part by sharing domestic and childcare
duties equally with their partners, but achieving gender
equality in domestic labor and childcare across the entire
population of academics would require either (1) all households to split duties evenly or (2) large numbers of men to do
more than half of the domestic and childcare work in their
households, to compensate for the large number of households in which men and women have traditional gender
roles. Gender equality in academia cannot rely on the coordinated behavior of hundreds of thousands of households, so
we point to institutional supports later on.

Service
A second potential mechanism that might explain the gender
imbalance in preprint submissions is an increase in service
expectations during the pandemic. In a survey of tenured
and tenure-track faculty members from four-year colleges
and universities, women reported about 30 more minutes
per week of service than men, even after controlling for
rank, race, and discipline. Full professors spent the most
time, with women full professors reporting notably more
time spent on service than men professors (Guarino and
Borden 2017).
The advent of the pandemic also created needs for universities to develop both short- and long-term plans for academic and student life (The Chronicle of Higher Education
2020b). Most universities and colleges dealt with this administrative burden by developing working groups that included
faculty members, another form of internal university service.
As the gender gap in service time is driven primarily by
internal service (Guarino and Borden 2017), this increased
need likely exacerbated the demands on women faculty
members’ time during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Transition to Online Teaching
The third potential mechanism that may explain the gender
gap in productivity rates is that the pandemic may have exacerbated women’s already greater teaching expectations.
Research shows women generally have academic positions
with higher teaching commitments (AAUP 2001; Misra et al.
2011). Women are less likely to hold positions at research
universities and more likely to work in adjunct or other temporary teaching roles (Finkelstein, Conley, and Schuster
2016; Monks 2009; Steinþórsdóttir et al. 2018). Research
suggests that online teaching takes more time, especially

Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World ﻿
when initially creating a class, than in-person teaching
(Kenny and Fluck 2017; Myers et al. 2020; Tomei 2006). In
the spring term at the beginning of the COVID-19 shelter-athome orders, instructors were asked to quickly move their
classes online (The Chronicle of Higher Education 2020a).
This created greater time demands on faculty members with
larger teaching responsibilities. As these faculty members
are disproportionately women, the reduced research productivity of women during the shelter-at-home orders may be
due in part to increased teaching demands. This proposed
mechanism of increased teaching demands is supported by
findings from a qualitative study of academic mothers during
the early pandemic, who reported prioritizing teaching and
mentoring, while discarding or postponing research (Minello,
Martucci, and Manzo 2020).
Furthermore, women are generally expected to perform
more emotional labor in the classroom than men (Bellas
1999). This involves more outreach to underperforming students and more time spent in office hours supporting students’ personal and psychosocial development (El-Alayli,
Hansen-Brown, and Ceynar 2018). Women faculty members, particularly women of color faculty members, must
engage in a disproportionate amount of emotional labor for
the university, especially for required diversity courses
(Moore et al. 2010). With the dramatic changes to students’
personal lives that came with the COVID-19 pandemic and
associated shelter-at-home orders, women professors likely
spent more time on emotional labor tasks.

Methods
Compiling the Data Set
We drew our data on preprints from two sources. The biological science preprint server bioRxiv is maintained by Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory. Run by Cornell University, arXiv
is a preprint server mainly for physics, math, computer science, and statistics, but it also accepts preprints in electrical
engineering and systems science, quantitative finance, economics, and quantitative biology. We scraped data using the
contributed R packages aRxiv (Karthik and Broman 2019)
and rbiorxiv (Fraser 2020), which provide interfaces for the
arXiv and bioRxiv application programming interfaces
(APIs), respectively, in the R programming language.
We began by downloading all submission records for
March 15 to April 15, 2020 (inclusive), during the COVID19 pandemic. We chose this date range to roughly correspond to the period when the largest number of schools
closed worldwide in attempts to slow the spread of COVID19. On March 15, 2020, an estimated 485 million children
were out of school because of the pandemic (28 percent of
the world’s schoolchildren), and this number quickly grew
to 1,577 million children (90 percent of the world’s schoolchildren) by April 15, 2020 (UNESCO Institute for
Statistics 2020), before declining somewhat in late April as

King and Frederickson
certain countries or states reopened schools. For comparison, we also scraped submission data for the same dates the
previous year (i.e., March 15 to April 15, 2019, inclusive),
before the pandemic.
Next, we expanded the date range to scrape all the preprint submission data for January 1, 2020, to June 30, 2020
(inclusive), to monitor changes in the gender composition of
preprint authorships immediately before widespread school
and childcare closures, and during the pandemic, which was
declared by the World Health Organization on March 11,
2020, and continues at the time of writing. On June 30, 2020,
1,067 million children were out of school (61 percent of the
world’s schoolchildren) (UNESCO Institute for Statistics
2020).
We completed two complementary analyses. The yearover-year analysis, comparing March and April 2020 with
March and April 2019, evaluates the effect of the pandemic,
holding constant time of year. This is important because paper
submission rates can vary throughout the year, depending on
holidays and the demands of the academic calendar. However,
we also conducted a second analysis, in case March and April
2019 happened to be aberrant (i.e., in case there happened to
be unusual productivity by men or women academics in
March and April 2019). The analysis of January to June 2020
serves to evaluate the effect of the pandemic, holding constant longer term trends in preprint submissions that may
complicate year-over-year analyses. The pandemic’s effects
have occurred against a backdrop of women’s increasing participation in STEM. Thus, the short-term January to June
2020 analysis is especially important, because there may be
few trends year over year if women’s productivity increased
relative to men’s before the pandemic but declined during the
pandemic (i.e., these forces may tend to cancel out).
We used each author’s first name to predict gender (see
below), but the bioRxiv API returned first names only for corresponding authors. One of us (M.E.F.) previously published
an analysis that included only corresponding authors from
bioRxiv (Frederickson 2020). To obtain first names for all
authors of bioRxiv preprints, we first compiled submission
data from the bioRxiv API, then used the rcrossref package in
R (Chamberlain et al. 2020) to look up each digital object
identifier and download the citation in BibTeX format, which
included first and last names for all authors. This workaround
allowed us to collect first names for all authors who provided
them when they submitted preprints to bioRxiv.
For all analyses, we define the unit of interest as a unique
author-paper, which we refer to as an authorship. Following
other bibliometric analyses (e.g., King et al. 2017), we include
authors who submitted multiple preprints, not only unique
authors. Thus, an authorship is an author on a single paper.

Predicting Author Gender
After extracting the first names of authors, we assigned gender to author names using the R gender package (Mullen

7
2019). This package returns the probability that a name is
that of a man or a woman by comparing the name with names
in a database; we used the U.S. Social Security Administration
baby names database. The R gender package matches names
on the basis of a complete sample of Social Security card
applications. As a result, prediction is less robust for scientists born outside the United States.
We did not attempt to predict the gender of names not
matched to the U.S. Social Security Administration baby
names database, because such efforts to increase coverage
could come with a loss of accuracy. A study comparing
approaches using name matching on the basis of Social
Security records with others showed that including data sets
from other countries, manual coding of names, or a unisex
category might produce more biased results (Wais 2016).
Among the approaches studied, there was a trade-off between
predicting gender for as many individuals as possible and
maximizing prediction accuracy.
Nonetheless, matching names to a names database is a
brute-force method of predicting gender, and it has limitations (see Mullen 2019). By using this method, we are not
assuming that individuals are correctly gendered in the
resulting data set but merely that it provides insight into
gender’s effects in aggregate across the population of preprint authors. This approach clearly misgenders or excludes
some individual authors, but it is necessarily used to measure gender bias in large data sets. Both the specific package
we used and other similar gender algorithms (e.g., genderize.io) have been used in other studies (e.g., Amano-Patiño
et al. 2020; Vincent-Lamarre, Sugimoto, and Larivière
2020b; West et al. 2013).

Summary Statistics and Modeling Approach
There were 149,124 preprints in the data set we assembled:
114,632 arXiv preprints and 34,492 bioRxiv preprints.
These preprints had a total of 808,227 nonunique authorships: 549,512 arXiv authorships and 258,715 bioRxiv
authorships. Some individuals authored more than one preprint in the data set.
For each preprint with multiple authors, we determined
whether authors were listed in alphabetical order by last
name. Importantly, some preprints will have authors listed
in alphabetical order just by chance, no matter which
authorship order convention they used (e.g., preprints with
two authors should list them in alphabetical order 50 percent of the time by chance alone). We compared the
observed proportion of preprints with authors in alphabetical order with the expected proportion if author order were
determined at random (Figure A2). Thirty-four percent of
arXiv preprints with multiple authors (33,034 of 98,050)
listed authors in alphabetical order, compared with only 7
percent of bioRxiv preprints (2,372 of 33,684). The
observed proportion of bioRxiv preprints with authors in
alphabetical order was almost identical to the expected

8
proportion due to chance, but arXiv has an excess of preprints with authors in alphabetical order (Figure A2). These
results confirm that bioRxiv preprints do not list authors in
alphabetical order by convention, but arXiv preprints sometimes do, especially in math and economics and quantitative finance (Figure A1).
We inferred the gender of 266,133, or 48.4 percent, of
arXiv authors and 195,204, or 75.5 percent, of bioRxiv
authors, with the rest omitted from subsequent analyses. This
lower success rate for predicting author gender for arXiv
than bioRxiv preprints reflects the fact that arXiv preprints
are more likely to list large consortia as authors (e.g., CMS
Collaboration), have authors who provide only first initials,
or have authors who have names not in the U.S. Social
Security names database. Nonetheless, similar fractions of
authorships with unknown gender are typical for large data
sets (Wais 2016).
Using the data from January 1 to June 30, 2020, we modeled the number of preprint authorships per day as a function
of submission date and gender.8 We included the interaction
between submission date and gender in our linear models to
determine whether the number of men authorships is increasing significantly faster through time than the number of
women authorships (i.e., whether growth in the number of
men authorships has a significantly higher slope than growth
in the number of women authorships). We also included the
day of the week as a main effect in all models to account for
the fact that far fewer preprints are submitted on Saturdays
and Sundays. We ran a separate model for each author position (i.e., first, middle, last, and sole) and data set (i.e., arXiv
and bioRxiv). We square-root-transformed the number of
preprint authorships per day to improve the normality of
residuals and checked residual diagnostic plots for all models. We then used the car package (Fox and Weisberg 2019)
in R to perform analyses of variance with type III sums of
squares.

Results
We found that all analyses of both arXiv and bioRxiv preprints show a widening gender gap in last (or “senior”)
authorships but more mixed results for other authorship positions. For arXiv, all authorship positions combined and most
authorship positions analyzed separately also show a growing gender gap. In contrast, for bioRxiv, only last authorships
show a much larger gender gap during than before the pandemic; analyses of other authorship positions and all authorships combined show few differences between genders. In
fact, year over year, women actually gained substantial

Note that although many more preprints are submitted to arXiv
than bioRxiv every day, because we treated the number of preprint
authorships per day as the unit of analysis in our statistical models,
all models had the same degrees of freedom and thus similar statistical power to detect gender differences.

ground relative to men as first authors of bioRxiv preprints.
We also separately analyzed physics, math, and computer
science preprints submitted to arXiv and found that all
authorships positions combined showed an increasing gender gap in all three fields, except in the year-over-year analysis for computer science.

Year-over-Year Comparisons
arXiv Preprints from 2019 to 2020. We began by comparing
arXiv preprint authorships between March 15 and April 15,
2020, during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the
same dates in 2019. We found that the number of arXiv preprint authorships increased between 2019 and 2020 for all
authorship positions and genders (Figure 1). Increases in preprint submissions between 2019 and 2020 are perhaps not
surprising, as scientific output and the popularity of preprint
servers have both been increasing in recent years (Penfold
and Polka 2020), and the time-sensitive nature of COVID-19
research may also have encouraged greater use of preprint
servers among scientists (Fraser et al. 2020). On the other
hand, we might have expected decreased productivity overall
during the pandemic because of illness and bereavement and
also laboratory closures affecting experimental scientists.
Nonetheless, there were 14,978 submissions to arXiv
between March 15 and April 15, 2020, compared with 13,733
submissions in the same date range in 2019, an increase of
9.1 percent.
Although arXiv preprint submissions were up overall, men
authorships grew more year over year than women authorships, both for all authorship positions combined and for all
authorship positions analyzed separately, except first authorships (Figure 1). For all authorship positions combined, men
added 1,648 authorships and women added 189 authorships in
March and April 2020 compared with March and April 2019,
corresponding to increases of 6.4 percent and 2.7 percent for
men and women, respectively. Put differently, in March and
April 2019, 78.7 percent of arXiv authorships were men, but
89.7 percent of the additional authorships in 2020 were men.
Next, we separately analyzed the data for preprints with
single authors and for first, middle, and last authorships of
multiauthored preprints. There were 112 more preprints soleauthored by men but just 7 more preprints sole-authored by
women in March and April 2020 than in March and April
2019, representing increases of 9.6 percent and 3.7 percent,
respectively (Figure 1). In contrast, there were 514 more men
first authorships and 145 more women first authorships in
March and April 2020 than in March and April 2019, or 9.2
percent and 9.8 percent increases, respectively. In other
words, in absolute terms, there was a greater increase in men
than women first authorships of multiauthored arXiv preprints between March and April 2019 and March and April
2020, but women made slightly greater gains than men in the
first author position when measured as a percentage change,
year over year.

middle, and last authorships are for multiauthored preprints only. Percentages above bars show percentage change year over year for
each author position and gender.

However, women lagged behind men in gains as middle
and last authors of multiauthored papers. Specifically, there
were 627 more men last authorships but only 8 more women
last authorships between March and April 2019 and March
and April 2020. This represents a 10.6 percent increase in
men last authorships, while women last authorships were
essentially unchanged over the same period, having grown
just 0.6 percent. Finally, the number of women middle
authorships rose by 29 from March and April 2019 to March
and April 2020, a change of just 0.7 percent, while the number of men middle authorships rose by 395, or 3 percent. In
summary, except for first authorships, men made greater
gains than women as arXiv preprint authors during the

pandemic, compared to the same dates the previous year.
Furthermore, the gender gap is growing fastest among last
authors.
Unlike bioRxiv, which holds preprints for the biosciences,
the arXiv repository serves many academic fields. To understand how the pandemic is affecting gender disparities in different fields, we compared the fields with the largest numbers
of preprints (physics, computer science, and mathematics;
see Figure A1) across years. In the year-over-year analysis,
the general pattern of less rapid growth in the number of
women than men authorships holds in physics and math, but
not computer science, where the growth in women authorships outpaced that of men authorships in relative (but not

growth in women authorships in computer science is less
than it would have otherwise been if the pandemic had not
happened, as perhaps women were already gaining ground.
bioRxiv Preprints from 2019 to 2020. We conducted an identical analysis for preprints in the biological and life sciences
by analyzing submission data from the preprint repository
bioRxiv. In general, we found that the pandemic has not
exacerbated gender differences among bioRxiv preprint
authors as much as among arXiv preprint authors, although
there has still been a growing gender gap in the last author
position.

As a preprint repository, bioRxiv receives fewer submissions than arXiv, but the number of bioRxiv submissions
grew from 3,381 preprints between March 15 and April 15,
2019, to 4,437 preprints over the same dates in 2020, an
increase of 31 percent. Across all author positions, women
authorships have actually increased a little more than men
authorships year over year, as a percentage change. In absolute terms, there were 2,669 more women authorships compared with 4,168 more men authorships in March and April
2020 than in March and April 2020, representing increases of
39 percent and 36.9 percent, respectively (Figure 2). This is
consistent with a long-standing trend in which women had
been narrowing the gender gap in the biological and life

King and Frederickson
sciences before the pandemic, although we note that our
analysis does not allow us to determine whether women
would have made even larger gains in preprint authorships if
not for COVID-19.
Next we again broke this down by author position and discovered that this pattern was driven by a large increase in the
number of women first authorships on multiauthored preprints. Both as a percentage change and an absolute change
year over year, there was a larger increase in the number of
women first authorships than the number of men first authorships. There were an additional 354 women first authorships
(37.1 percent) and 291 men first authorships (19.4 percent) in
March and April 2020 compared with the same dates in 2019.
In contrast, sole, middle, and last authorships all increased
faster for men than women, although there is a large gender
difference only for the last author position. Women submitted 6 additional sole-authored preprints to bioRxiv (up 35.3
percent) in March and April 2020 compared with March/
April 2019, while men submitted 23 more sole-authored preprints (up 37.1 percent); however, the absolute numbers are
small, limiting the conclusions we can draw from these data.
There was slightly more growth among men than women
middle authorships, with an additional 2,183 women middle
authorships and 3,334 men middle authorships between
March and April 2019 and 2020, representing percentage
gains of 41.9 percent and 42.3 percent, respectively. But
although women almost kept pace with men as middle
authors, they lagged far behind men as last authors; there
were 520 more men last authorships but only 126 more
women last authorships between March and April 2019 and
2020, increases of 28.2 percent and 18.6 percent, respectively (Figure 2).
Thus, compared with arXiv, the pattern among author
positions in year-over-year change is more mixed: sole, middle, and last men authorships increased at a faster rate than
women authorships, but with a pronounced difference only
for last authorships, while women in first author positions
continued to increase their rate of productivity, potentially
reflecting prepandemic trends toward greater gender equity.
These findings, however, are complicated by our analyses of
the first six months of 2020 in the next section.

Trends in Preprint Submissions Immediately
before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic
Next, we looked back over the months leading up to widespread stay-at-home orders and school and childcare closures
in late March or early April 2020. These measures were
implemented to different degrees and on different dates in
different parts of the world, but we assumed that their effects
would be most pronounced (globally) starting in March
2020. We also expanded our analysis forward in time through
June 30, 2020. Thus, we analyzed data for the first six months
of 2020.

11
arXiv Preprints in the Early Pandemic. For the arXiv data set,
the pattern of women making smaller authorship gains during the pandemic than men holds across all authorship positions, but with varying effect sizes (Figure 3, Table 1). Again,
during the pandemic, the number of men authorships has
grown faster than the number of women authorships, visible
in Figure 3 (and Figure A4) as the divergence of the two
lines. We tested for differences in the slopes of these lines in
linear models, by predicting the number of preprint authorships per day as a function of gender, date, day of the week,
and a gender × date interaction effect. Gender always had a
significant main effect, which means that there were always
significantly more men authorships than women authorships
at the model intercept (i.e., on January 1, 2020) (Table 1).
Day of the week also always had a significant effect on the
number of preprint authorships, with significantly fewer submissions on weekends, and generally more on Mondays and
Tuesdays than later in the workweek (Table 1). Because
women were the reference group in our linear models, the
main effect of date tests whether women authorships
increased through time, from January 1 to June 30, 2020.
For everything except sole authorships, the number of
women authorships increased significantly over this period
(Table 1). For sole authorships, there was no significant main
effect of date, meaning that the number of arXiv preprints
sole-authored by women stayed flat between January 1 and
June 30, 2020 (Table 1, Figure 3). The gender × date interaction term in the linear models tests whether men and women
authorships increased at the same rate through time; again
because women are the reference group in our models, positive interaction coefficients mean that men have outpaced
women in the growth of authorships, while negative interaction coefficients would mean that women have outpaced men.
The magnitude of the (positive) gender × date coefficients
specifies how much faster men authorships grew over the first
six months of 2020 than women authorships. For all five
authorship categories (all authorships combined, sole authorships, and first, last, and middle authorships on multiauthored
preprints), there was a significantly positive gender × date
interaction term (Table 1). In other words, the rate of increase
in men authorships was always steeper than the rate of
increase in women authorships. For all arXiv author positions, the number of men authorships has grown faster than
the number of women authorships during the pandemic.
We also split this analysis by field for the arXiv repository,
and the general pattern holds in physics, mathematics, and
computer science (Figure A4, Table A1). The date × gender
interaction term is significant, meaning the figures show a
steeper increase in men than women authorships between
January 1 and June 30, 2020. The magnitude of the interaction (the slope of the line) is greater for physics and computer
science and smallest (but still significant) for math (Table
A1). The figure for computer science also shows that the
number of men authorships is lower in late March and early

bioRxiv Preprints in the Early Pandemic. As with arXiv submissions, we also compared bioRxiv submissions across the first
six months of 2020 to investigate the effect of the onset of
the pandemic on submissions by authorships in each position

(Figure 4). The number of submissions is rising across the
six months for both genders, significantly so for all author
positions except sole authorships (Table 2). However, there
are no significant gender × date interaction effects for all

14
authorship positions in aggregate, sole authorships, first
authorships, or middle authorships (Table 2). This implies
that the changes in the publication rates for men and women
are statistically indistinguishable at all author positions,
except last authorships. Furthermore, although the number of
women first authorships on bioRxiv preprints grew more
year over year than the number of men first authorships (Figure 2), the data and linear model results for the first six
months of 2020 suggest women have kept pace with (but not
outpaced) men as first authors during this period (Table 2,
Figure 4). This implies that the year over year differences
may reflect relative growth in women first authorships that
happened late in 2019. The relative rates of men and women
first authorships have held steady during the pandemic.
Nonetheless, for bioRxiv preprints as for arXiv preprints,
the number of men last authorships has grown significantly
faster than the number of women last authorships during the
first six months of 2020. There is a significant gender × date
interaction term (Table 2), with men increasing in productivity faster than women for last author positions in bioRxiv
from January to June 2020. This interaction effect is visible
in Figure 4 as the divergence of the two lines in the last
authorships panel.

Discussion
Women scientists have experienced a productivity penalty
from the social and structural changes accompanying the
COVID-19 pandemic, but not in all authorship positions. We
found identical patterns in arXiv and bioRxiv for the increasing gender gap in the last author position: women’s relative
rate of productivity in last authorships has declined significantly. In the arXiv repository—which covers the fields of
physics, math, statistics, economics and quantitative finance,
electrical engineering and systems science, computer science, and quantitative biology—there was also a significant
reduction in women authorships in the first, middle, last, and
sole author positions. We found no such effect in the bioRxiv
repository, which publishes preprints from the biological sciences. The difference between the repositories is not a problem of statistical power. Instead, we suggest that these
findings are consistent with the fact that a greater proportion
of authorships in the arXiv preprint repository are with
authors in alphabetical order, whereas author order in the
biological sciences is almost universally decided by contributions to the paper (see Figure A2; Waltman 2012), and
senior women may have experienced greater constraints on
productivity during the pandemic.
Notably, first authorships by women increased significantly more than men between 2019 and 2020 in bioRxiv
and slightly more as a percent change year-over-year in
arXiv, likely a result of the increasing representation of

Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World ﻿
women in science (Fox et al. 2017). However, in the arXiv
repository, we still saw a relative decline (compared with
men) in first authorships among women in the early months
of COVID-19, reflecting a slowdown in women’s productivity in the physical sciences and mathematics. Given the large
representation gap that yet remains in these fields, any deceleration in productivity will reduce gender equity. Although
the first authorship gender gap in bioRxiv actually shrunk
between 2019 and 2020 and was unaffected in early 2020,
we find that the rate of submission of bioRxiv preprints by
women in last authorships has been negatively affected by
the pandemic, as it has in the arXiv data set.
Our results are consistent with an extensive literature on
gender-based productivity differences. This includes the
facts that women academics are disproportionately responsible for childcare and household work, more likely to be
in dual-career relationships with other academics, and
have more service and teaching responsibilities. The true
cause is likely some combination of these. The extraordinary childcare burden brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, disproportionately shouldered by women, is
consistent with our finding that gender gaps are growing
fastest among last authors. Women academics are more
likely to reduce their work hours and deprioritize their
careers when family needs arise. Our society has long
depended on invisible and undervalued care and domestic
work (England, Budig, and Folbre 2002; Madowitz,
Rowell, and Hamm 2016); the pandemic has undermined
these structures that support the “ideal worker.” Faced
with added domestic responsibilities, together with disproportionate service, teaching, and emotional labor, senior
women faculty’s research productivity has decreased during the pandemic.
However, in the first, middle, and sole author positions,
women authorship rates have not been affected by the pandemic in bioRxiv—only in arXiv. This finding reveals that
the underrepresentation of women scientists in the prestige
authorship positions necessary for retention and promotion
(in the biological sciences) and all authorship positions (in
the physical sciences and mathematics) is only getting more
inequitable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Publication
productivity has important implications for cumulative
advantage and visibility in careers (Fowler and Aksnes 2007;
Leahey 2007). In a “publish or perish” world, the social fallout of the pandemic could set back the hard-won progress of
women in STEM.
Although the overall conclusions have different emphases,
our results align with other similar analyses of preprint repositories (Cui et al. 2020; Matthews 2020; Muric et al. 2020;
Shurchkov et al. 2020), as discussed in the introduction. For
example, we know that the gender gap in research focusing
on COVID-19 is even larger than the general gender gap in

King and Frederickson
productivity during the pandemic (Amano-Patiño et al. 2020;
Andersen et al. 2020; Gabster et al. 2020; Pinho-Gomes et al.
2020), suggesting that the disparity may be due primarily to
women not joining new pandemic-related projects. Then
again, we also see a growing gender gap among physics preprints in the arXiv repository, although fewer than 1 percent
of physics preprints mention COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, or
coronavirus in the abstract.
Our results differ from those of published studies in two
ways. First, Vincent-Lamarre et al. (2020a) found that the
proportion of first authorships by women in bioRxiv and
arXiv remained steady. One possible reason we find a small
(but significant) increase in the gender gap among first
authorships of arXiv preprints is that the gender prediction
algorithm used by Vincent-Lamarre et al. (2020b) assigned
gender to a greater proportion of names.9 We speculate that
our results may reflect the predominance of North American
and European names in our final data set (because we predicted gender using a U.S. names database), while perhaps
Vincent-Lamarre et al. (2020a) included a more globally representative set of author names. The differences in how
Europe and North America have responded to the pandemic,
compared with other regions of the world, may therefore
explain our conflicting results. Our findings may thus be limited to the context of North American and European academic science.
Second, a survey of pandemic time use found that those
in the laboratory-based “bench” sciences experienced the
most dramatic declines in time spent on research (Myers
et al. 2020). Given this, we might have expected the reverse
of our findings, as bioRxiv may have more submissions
from those in the bench sciences than does the arXiv repository. Instead, differences in how the pandemic is affecting
men’s and women’s preprint submissions to arXiv versus
bioRxiv may reflect the different legacies of historical gender bias in the physical and life sciences, or different fieldspecific conventions or cultures regarding coauthorships
and author order.
The trends we find in both bioRxiv and arXiv preprints
support our hypothesis that the pandemic is disproportionately reducing the productivity of women scholars. How
long this effect will persist, and what its downstream consequences might be for journal publications and academic
careers, are open questions that can only be answered with
time and further research. Our analysis could also be
9

Vincent-Lamarre et al. (2020b) assigned gender to 79 percent
compared with our 48 percent of names in arXiv and 92 percent
compared with our 76 percent for bioRxiv. In addition to the U.S.
Social Security names database, their gender disambiguation algorithm includes data from several other countries, including France,
Canada, Korea, Lithuania, Iran, Romania, Brazil and Portugal,
Serbia, Ukraine, Thailand, India, and Japan. A list from Wikipedia
is also included, which includes names associated with more than
60 countries (Larivière et al. 2013).

extended to further examine the effects of field, institution,
or country. Further research could investigate why fields differ in the consistency of women’s first authorship productivity during the early months of COVID-19, as these
disciplinary differences might provide further insight into
ways to support women scholars.

Policy Recommendations
Institutions of higher education need to heed these warning
signals and take action now to prevent significant backsliding on gender equity. Given the novel nature of the challenges facing women during the pandemic, universities can
and should do more than continue to implement known recommendations for supporting women faculty (Hill et al.
2010). As the growing gap in preprint submissions holds
across the last author position, rather than making recommendations for each field, we suggest that universities take
steps to support women principal investigators in general.
Hiring, tenure, and promotion committees should recalibrate
expectations and make them clear (Malisch et al. 2020). Bias
creeps in when there is ambiguity (Ridgeway 2011). Because
women increasingly choose occupations that allow them to
reconcile the competing time demands of work and family
(Damelang and Ebensperger 2020), it is crucial that universities provide institutional support for the unique challenges of
this moment. In this section of the article, we outline
research-based solutions institutions can implement to
address the pandemic’s unequal impacts going forward.

Hiring and Evaluating
Universities should make a strong effort to communicate to
departments and hiring committees the importance of producing diverse slates of job candidates and considering in their
selection process the fact that the pandemic has negatively
affected women and other underrepresented groups. We analyzed the pandemic’s effects on scholarly productivity only
by gender, but we encourage similar efforts to explore how
the pandemic is affecting Black, Asian, Latinx, and Indigenous
scholars, as well as academics with disabilities and other
equity-seeking groups. The pandemic has likely exacerbated
other preexisting inequities because of the unequal disease
burden (Williamson et al. 2020), discrimination and bias during the pandemic, and increased emotional labor.
Institutions can reduce bias by ensuring evaluations are
holistic and transforming the process with equity in mind
(Liera 2020). Acknowledging that gender bias exists in the
pandemic is crucial to minimizing its impact; evaluators who
think that bias is not happening in their fields are the key
drivers of it (Begeny et al. 2020). Candidates should be given
the opportunity to provide a written narrative, along with
multiple forms of evidence (Htun 2020). However, asking
academics to self-report how they have been individually
affected could open the door to bias, whereby women are

16

Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World ﻿

generally penalized in evaluations for having children or
spouses when men are not (Benard and Correll 2010; Correll,
Benard, and Paik 2007; Rivera 2017).10 Institutions should
explicitly not require any teaching evaluations from the transition period of the pandemic as part of hiring, retention, or
promotion materials (Gonzales and Griffin 2020).
Universities will need to take action to ensure that women
scholars are not disproportionately harmed in the tenure and
promotion process. Many colleges and universities have
been offering (sometimes automatic) extensions of the tenure clock. However, because this extension is offered to all
assistant professors, it is not clear if it will address disproportionate harm to women. Tenure clock extension policies must
be implemented carefully so as not to harm women scholars
(Antecol, Bedard, and Stearns 2018; Manchester, Leslie, and
Kramer 2013; Williams and Lee 2016). Furthermore, extensions delay the increase in pay and power that come with
promotion for both women and men (Manchester et al.
2013). Tenure clock extensions are “not a panacea” (Malisch
et al. 2020). If offered, “opt-out” extensions are preferable
because the effort to opt out falls on the most privileged
(Gonzales and Griffin 2020). When promoted, salary
increases should be retroactive to when the faculty member
would have initially gone up for tenure in the absence of the
extension (Settles and Linderman 2020).
Committees must resist comparing productivity from the
time of the extension, and they should specify to external
reviewers the years for which candidates should be evaluated
(Gonzales and Griffin 2020). Asking committees to completely discount papers written during the pandemic period is
unrealistic. Institutional shared governance groups need to
clarify expectations for productivity with gender equity in
mind. Malisch et al. (2020) outlined recommendations for
developing metrics and ensuring their institutional adoption;
they also provided a set of questions as a starting point for
evaluation committees.11

work like review articles, syntheses or commentaries, and
data mining. Faculty development offices could encourage
interdisciplinary collaborations among campus faculty.
Small stipends, or even merely coordinating infrastructure,
could be provided to encourage subject matter experts to collaborate with methodologists across fields. Such flexible
approaches to thinking about productivity will make room
for gender differences in methodology across disciplines
during a time when some may be more difficult to use than
others. It will also provide a structure for women researchers
to deploy their existing expertise in productive new ways.
Institutions can also support their women faculty in sharing their expertise in other ways during this critical time.
Women currently make up fewer than one quarter of COVID19 experts in the media and national task forces. University
press offices can also “amplify the voices of women with
established records in infectious disease, pandemic response,
global health, and health security” (Gabster et al. 2020:1969).
This can be done by promoting existing research and helping
facilitate the ongoing involvement of women scholars in
COVID-19 policy making.

Rethinking Productivity

Supporting Teaching

Productivity can take different forms in a period in which
rapid science is in high demand. Tenure and promotion standards could be updated with a statement to allow op-eds,
reports, blogs, and other pieces written for popular audiences
to be considered equally valuable to peer-reviewed papers
during this time (Ellingson and Quinlan 2012); if not equally
valuable, then some certain number of pieces could be considered equivalent to a peer-reviewed contribution.
Researchers can also be encouraged to explore other types of

Rather than attempting to evaluate online learning or teaching efficacy using student evaluations, faculty members
should be asked to document the move to online teaching
using reflections or “before” and “after” syllabi (Gonzales
and Griffin 2020). Students consistently rate women instructors lower on evaluations (Boring 2017; Laube et al. 2007;
MacNell et al. 2015). If student evaluations are used during
online teaching, they should discount comments about organization, timeliness of responses, and interruptions and
appearance during online class time, as these may be particularly affected by gendered dynamics during the pandemic.
Faculty members can also be invited to document the
emotional labor and support provided to students during this
time (Gonzales and Griffin 2020). Moving forward, administrators can support faculty members by providing templates
for how to support students with common challenges.

Although it is worth noting that among highly paid women, the
motherhood penalty is explained largely by time out of the workforce (Budig and Hodges 2010).

Getting Scientists Back to Work
Taking time out of the labor force for childcare has immense
professional and economic costs for women—and men
(Madowitz et al. 2016). Universities that expect professors to
return to work need to be sure that their employees have
access to adequate, safe childcare. Institutions should invest
in high-quality, on-campus childcare (with appropriate safety
measures) and offer small-group childcare not only for
infants and preschoolers but for school-aged children in
areas where schools continue to be closed (Fulweiler et al.
2021). Universities should also prioritize mothers for returning to offices and labs; space can be an issue for those in small
homes, especially if children are being cared for at home.

King and Frederickson
To account for the greater teaching demands of moving
courses online, institutions should consider shifting their percentage balances (for the relative importance of research,
teaching, and service) for faculty evaluation for the duration
of the pandemic. Universities could also consider providing
more course releases during this time, even though budgets
are tight (Settles and Linderman 2020). This could be administered through a special application-based program, giving
early-career mothers (and especially single parents) priority.
However, other potential consequences of such a program
should be considered, including the growth of the adjunct
workforce. An alternative could be providing additional
teaching assistant support, with a very minimal application
process to reduce barriers to its use.

Making Service and Funding Equitable
Even if course releases are not a possibility, institutions can
implement structured interventions to ensure equity in service
and teaching within departments. Ensuring that clear criteria
are regularly applied even at the departmental level throughout
these uncertain times will facilitate greater equity for women
and underrepresented minorities (O’Meara et al. 2018).
Institutions that have diverted university grants should
prioritize the return of funding for early-career mothers.
Universities could provide flexible spending accounts so
that mothers can hire caretakers for their children or elderly
parents. Flexible spending accounts could also allow spending for housework for all faculty members, a benefit that is
inclusive and also gender equitable (Schiebinger and
Gilmartin 2010). Additional funds for home office items can
reduce the challenges of working from home with children
or other family members. Grant-funding institutions should
provide extended deadlines and factor identity into research
evaluation (Witteman, Haverfield, and Tannenbaum 2021).

Closing the Gender Pay Gap
At many institutions, women faculty continue to be paid
lower salaries than men faculty, even after controlling for
field and career stage (AAUP 2018; Fox et al. 2017). If universities took greater steps to close the gender pay gap, then
women faculty in dual-career couples would not be the lower
earning partners. Although research suggests that earning as
much or more than their partners may not result in a more
equitable division of labor at home (Brines 1994; Pew
Research Center 2013; Tichenor 2005), increased wages for
women scientists can be put to other uses, such as childcare.
Realistically, it might already be too late for universities to
significantly narrow the gender pay gap during the COVID19 pandemic. But longer term investments in gender equality
are still needed to ensure an equitable recovery after the pandemic and to guard against future exogenous shocks to academic productivity, be they to particular individuals or more
widespread, as with COVID-19.

17

Structured Support
These kinds of changes will necessitate a focus on faculty
development, shared governance, and flexible thinking about
criteria for promotion and tenure. True gender equity in the
academy also demands greater inclusion of non-tenure-track
faculty members in developing strategic plans and initiatives
to support faculty (Rosen and Lester 2020).
Many of these suggestions will cost money. However,
compared with the substantial investments institutions have
previously dedicated to recruiting and retaining qualified
women faculty (Williams and Norton 2008), it would be
penny wise and pound foolish to ignore the needs of this
population during this critical time. An inclusive, diverse
committee to oversee institutional programs and evaluation
guidelines should be implemented at each college and university.12 The service contributions to such a committee
should be documented and valued for retention, tenure, and
promotion (Malisch et al. 2020).
Although we know much about what helps support
women and other underrepresented minority faculty members during regular circumstances, it remains to be seen if
these recommendations will carry over to the pandemic
academy. As universities implement programs to support
women and minority faculty members, we need research on
their efficacy so that future events do not lead to such consequential gender disparities.
For those who might read these suggestions and feel
they do not go far enough, given the constraints of the modern neoliberal model of the university (Ferree and Zippel
2015), we argue for a “small wins” approach to organizational change (Correll 2017). Using research-based tools to
reduce gender inequality, adapting these for the local organizational context, applying the intervention, and evaluating what enabled success will motivate organizational
leaders to continue making change. Transformational gender equity is possible in the academy—one small change at
a time.

Appendix
As the arXiv repository holds preprints for several academic fields,
we sought to validate whether the patterns in authorship order in
these fields within the repository match previous categorizations of
publications (Waltman 2012).
Figure A1a displays the total number of preprints in the arXiv
data set in each field. The arXiv data set is numerically dominated
by physics, math, and computer science preprints. The other fields
are only minor components.

category used by arXiv, with the exception of “econ,” which groups economics and quantitative finance together, because each field has
only a few preprints. cs = computer science; eess = electrical engineering and systems science; q-bio = quantitative biology.

are what percentage should be in alphabetical order just by chance (no matter what authorship convention the authors used), and gray

Figure A1b shows the percentage of arXiv preprints in alphabetical order by field. The field is the category that arXiv uses (https://
arxiv.org/category_taxonomy), except that we combined economics and quantitative finance because they each had a small number
of preprints. Math and economics and quantitative finance are the
fields with many preprints with authors listed alphabetically.
Figure A2 shows what percentage of arXiv and bioRxiv preprints have authors listed in alphabetical order, given the number

of authors on each preprint. We calculated the expected proportion
of authors in alphabetical order by chance alone as 1/n!, where
n is the number of authors on a paper. For bioRxiv, the observed
and expected values of the percentage of authors in alphabetical are essentially identical, meaning that bioRxiv authors do not
deliberately list authors in alphabetical order. This substantiates
the argument that bioRxiv preprints use the authorship convention

more preprints have authors in alphabetical order than are expected
by chance alone, meaning sometimes authors are indeed listed in
alphabetical order deliberately (i.e., by convention).
Figures A3 and A4 show the year-over-year and early 2020
analyses, respectively, for the arXiv fields of physics, math, and
computer science. As discussed in the main text, the year-over-year
analysis (Figure A3) displays a general pattern of less rapid growth
in the number of women than men authorships in physics and math;

in computer science, the growth in women authorships outpaced
that of men authorships in relative (but not absolute) terms.
During the pandemic, the number of men authorships has grown
faster than the number of women authorships in physics, math, and
computer science (Figure A4, Table A1). We also checked what the

other words, there is a steeper increase in men than women authorships between January 1 and June 30, 2020. However, for statistics

biology is consistent with the bioRxiv results: in both data sets

Author Biographies
Molly M. King is an assistant professor of sociology at Santa Clara
University. She studies knowledge inequalities and the implications
of these inequalities for people’s lives. She uses mixed methods,
paired with a commitment to open science, to understand how the
identities of gender, class, and disability influence information
acquisition. Her research has been supported by the National
Science Foundation.
Megan E. Frederickson is an associate professor of ecology and
evolutionary biology at the University of Toronto. She studies how
cooperation evolves between species in plant-animal and hostmicrobe mutualisms. She uses field, molecular, and computational
approaches to understand why individuals cooperate with other species and how mutualism and symbiosis affect ecological and evolutionary processes.
