Abstract
COVID-19 has made evident the complex interdependence of social and ecological systems
and that to reduce the risk of future zoonotic pandemics we must safeguard nature. Approaches
based on complexity science taking into account that interdependence and its associated
systemic risks must be mainstreamed in current policy making, in general. However, at present,
that could result in failure for three main reasons: (1) those approaches might be too
sophisticated for current policy making pursuing sustainable development; (2) the reductionist
views from conventional economics still deeply influence economic and environmental policy
making; (3) it is unlikely that far-reaching policies aimed at stimulating post-pandemic
economic development can be steered through radically innovative approaches that remain
untested. Here, using COVID-19 as an example, I suggest that the use of innovative
complexity-based approaches could be enabled through intermediary approaches equipped to
resonate with the mindset pervading current policy making.

Introduction

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is pushing
political, healthcare and socioeconomic systems, and people, to their limits worldwide. Its first
waves have impacted with a swiftness that have caught countries and local communities off
guard, exposing our ill-preparedness to respond to a global health emergency of catastrophic
magnitude. Thankfully, warnings from international and local authorities and experts, have
progressively influenced the implementation of containment policies across the world as the
pandemic has hit locally since March 2020—although with notable differences in their timing
(early vs delayed), approach (herd immunity vs suppressed equilibrium) and depth (mitigation
vs suppression) (Huang et al. 2020, ILO 2020, Ritchie et al. 2020). During containment and
subsequent de-escalation stages, those differences have certainly resulted in different
applications of similar policy measures (e.g., social distancing, testing and tracing,
confinement, self-care and personal hygiene) as countries have learned by doing, followed
expert advice, or reacted to new information or socio-political pressures (Desvars-Larrive et al.
2020, ILO 2020). In general, it is fair to say that, at least until now, the main aim worldwide
has been to protect the vulnerable populations and to not overwhelm public healthcare systems,
and thus save as many lives as possible.
As I write from Spain, countries around the world are in different stages of the pandemic. While
some countries and regions currently face new contagion waves, others are slowly leaving
behind the first ones and de-escalating from pandemic-enforced measures. Nobody can really
know when we will be able to proceed as safely as possible to a future already called the “new
normal”. In the interim, we already have sufficient information to thoroughly examine what
has just happened, learn the lessons and enhance prevention, early warning and preparedness
mechanisms to deal with future outbreaks internationally—so that they do not reach global
pandemic levels. Indeed, whether or not we are heading to a long-term succession of infection
peaks or waves, policy makers, experts, organizations and the civil society around the world
are now reflecting about the best courses action for designing prevention and containment
measures that do not jeopardize socioeconomic recovery in the post-pandemic future (DesvarsLarrive et al. 2020, ILO 2020).
But as critical as that exercise is, we should also be able to seize this as a unique opportunity
to be more ambitious than ever and go beyond the surface. COVID-19 has made more evident
than ever the inextricable and complex interdependence and mutual vulnerability of social and
ecological systems, and that to reduce the risks associated to future zoonotic pandemics we
must safeguard nature (Gordon 2020, Naidoo and Fisher 2020, Settele et al. 2020). Its acute
impact must not blind us to the fact that this crisis might be just symptomatic of higher threats
and systemic risks due to climate and global environmental change, which are just round the
corner, and there won’t be a wave period between them and COVID-19 (UNEP 2020). While
we try to understand the phenomenon, other episodic shocks (e.g., financial crashes, disease
outbreaks, large-scale environmental migrations) have been looming over us for decades,
increasing their speed of propagation at a planetary scale and posing high systemic risks (Keys
et al. 2019, Andersen and Rockström 2020). The level, scale and depth of our response to
2

confront the current pandemic could be a portent of our readiness to tackle those systemic risks
and global threats in the near future (Phillips et al. 2020). Although the current global strategy
continues to respond only through public health measures and technological solutions—most
notably the design and distribution of therapeutics and vaccines (IPBES 2020)—, we seem to
be in the right path. There is evidence from the media (e.g., The New York Times 2020) and
supranational policy (e.g., GNDE 2020) narratives suggesting rising awareness about the
double role of nature as a protective space for human survival and as critical for socioeconomic
recovery (IPBES 2020, World Economic Forum 2020). Approaches like Anthropocene risk
(Keys et al. 2019) and One Health (see e.g., Waltner-Toews 2017, Scagliarini and Alberti
2020), were designed to address global systemic risks and the complex, adaptive and uncertain
dynamics of connected systems of people and nature.
However, at present, the mainstreaming of those approaches in current policy making could
result in failure for three main reasons, in general. Firstly, those approaches might be too
sophisticated for current policy making pursuing sustainable development, which is largely
siloed (OECD 2019), and based on the prescription of blueprint, panacea solutions to highly
complex social-ecological problems (Ostrom 2007). Secondly, the reductionist views from
conventional economics still deeply influence economic and environmental policy making
(Foxon 2013, Thornton 2018, Maechler and Graz 2020), hindering the entry of complexitybased approaches into the mainstream. Thirdly, it is unlikely that far-reaching policies aimed
at stimulating post-pandemic economic development can be steered through radically
innovative approaches that remain untested—and even less when decisions seem to have
already been made and there don’t seem to be international concerted action on systemic risk
assessment.
Here, using COVID-19 as an example, I suggest that the use of innovative complexity-based
approaches in policy making aimed at managing global environmental systemic risks could be
enabled through intermediary approaches equipped to resonate with the mindset pervading
current policy making. Focusing on the containment and prevention stages, I first propose to
understand the response to unexpected systemic threats as instances of reactive policy making
driven by radical uncertainty. Then, I propose three notions that could enhance that
understanding, as well as the scientific policy support required in conditions of high systemic
risk and uncertainty, namely modulating contingency, adaptive inference and blue uncertainty.
My hope is that this approach can contribute to a more robust foundation for policy and decision
making in the face of Anthropocene risk.

Radical uncertainty and lessons from the containment of COVID-19

With COVID-19 experts and decision makers were facing, as it unfolded in real time, an
unanticipated problem that was showing extremely “wicked” (Rittel and Webber 1973) and
certainly falls within the realms of “Post-Normal Science” (Funtowicz and Ravetz 1993)—see
Table 1 for a description of criteria. The question that will hold relevance for some significant
time is whether the pandemic was entirely unpredictable. The discussion has already started
(see e.g., Frankel 2020, Frutos et al. 2020, IIF 2020, McGillivray 2020) and it is subjected to
3

ambiguity, at both epistemic level—uncertainty about the facts and nature of the
phenomenon—and strategic level—low consensus about the facts and nature of the
phenomenon due to political differences (Hall 2017).

Description

Wickedness
(Rittel and
Weber 1973)

-

-

Real-time solutions couldn’t be judged right or wrong, but just better or worse, since
they could only be tested trial-and-error; otherwise, it would have involved deciding
on who lived and who died.
Responsibility for those decisions was anyway passively transferred from the political
level to healthcare workers.
The pandemic is a symptom of more profound global problems, but they cannot be
tackled now, since resources are scarce and directed towards the resolution of the
symptom, as are political action, and media and public attention.

Post-normalness
(Funtowicz and
Ravetz 1993)

-

Decisions were made about a highly complex challenge.
The facts were highly uncertain.
Many values were in dispute.
The stakes were high and the decisions urgent.

Black-swanness
(Taleb 2007)

-

Being an outlier, because nothing in the past can convincingly point to its possibility,
hence it lies outside the realm of regular expectations: history shows that infectious
diseases, epidemics and pandemics occur regularly and, despite, as shown above,
COVID-19 was difficult to predict, it can take decades until we know whether it will
be an outlier on the plot.
Carry an extreme impact: the pandemic is carrying an extreme impact, psychological,
socioeconomic, on our health systems and, in the near future, chances are that there is
a rebound effect on the environment.
In spite of its outlier status, an explanation is sought after the fact, hence making it
predictable in hindsight: while this criterion can be understood as normalizing an
event by rendering it predictable in hindsight (McGillivray 2020), I conceive it here as
the possibility for abductive reasoning, i.e., producing inferences to the best
explanation as the pandemic unfolds, based on past knowledge.

-

-

The epistemic level, moreover, has two sides of the argument pertaining to the issue of
prediction and forecasting in science 1, and, in principle, both sides do not seem incompatible:
(a) the conjunction of events leading to the pandemic as rare enough to be characterized as an
unpredictable accident 2 for which we could not have been prepared (see e.g., Frutos et al.
2020); (b) that we already had certain capacity to forecast the occurrence of the pandemic based
Here, a prediction is understood as an expectation (e.g., value of a random variable) in relation of an information
set (e.g., combination of values of predictor variables), calculated through a model obtained, for example, by a fit
to some available data (e.g., predictive curve). Prediction turns forecasting when the predictor is time (a
continuous variable), and expected values can be derived outside of the range of observed time points through
extrapolation.

Frutos et al. (2020) define unpredictable accident as “the occurrence of a very low probability event resulting
from the stochastic conjunction of independent low probability events”, referring to the conjunction of events that
they describe in their article in more detail.

on rough extrapolations from past outbreaks or, more importantly, on existing knowledge about
risk factors for human disease emergence (Morse 1996, Taylor et al. 2001, Cheng et al. 2007,
Ge et al. 2013, Menachery et al. 2016).
What seems clear for now is that the compound effect of several factors made a reactive
containment response to the pandemic unavoidable from the outset (Fig. 1). First, there was a
logical unawareness of local communities and authorities from Wuhan (China) about SARSCoV-2 emerging in the wild and being zoonotically transmitted to humans in anthropic
environments (Fig. 1). Transmission and infection then remained stealthy during a phase of
latency (Fig. 1), which lasted until an outbreak of a “respiratory contagion owing an uncharted
etiology” was first reported in Wuhan 3 (Kumar et al. 2020). By way of an amplification phase,
the epidemic was well underway in December-January 2019, driven by a tight combination of
key social and virological/disease factors (Fig. 1) (Frutos et al. 2020, He et al. 2020). For Frutos
et al. (2020), these events, in conjunction with globalization factors such as international hyperconnectivity and high-mobility of people (Fig. 1), constituted a rare “planetary alignment” that
led to the emergence of the pandemic.

and of the contingency signal (right y-axis, red arrow), against a description of key factors for the emergence

The contagion agent was termed as “novel corona virus 2019” by the World Health Organization (WHO) on
29th December 2019, and as SARS-CoV-2 on 11th February 2020 (Guo et al. 2020).

This alignment of events moves in the quicksand of radical uncertainty (Kay and King 2020),
which distinguishes between resolvable and radical uncertainty. 4 In that view, resolvable
uncertainty can be fixed through known probability distributions of outcomes, whereas radical
uncertainty represents something that “we simply do not know” and cannot be described in
probabilistic (game-like) terms—due to, for example, obscurity, ignorance, vagueness,
ambiguity, ill-defined problems, or a lack of information (Kay and King 2020). During the prepandemic phase, we might have known that a new outbreak was possible based on rough
forecasting. However, despite all the extant knowledge about emerging diseases and
globalization, at the outset of the amplification phase of the pandemic (Fig. 1) we lacked the
capacity to predict, with high precision and accuracy, the complex sequence of events that led
to it—and much less to foretell its evolution and exact casualty numbers. Indeed,
compartmental SIR-like models, one of the dominant modeling paradigms supporting policy
during the pandemic, while informative about the likelihood of potential trajectories and future
opposing scenarios in short-time prediction horizons, are unable to predict how the
intermediate and late stages will develop—due to unavoidable uncertainties, instabilities and
high sensitivity to small variations linked to model parameters and data scarcity (Castro et al.
2020). We were confronting radical uncertainty and high systemic risks (Fig. 1) and, to
effectively respond to them, hard containment policies had to be designed and implemented,
based on the best available evidence and epidemiologic models. And the arrow of time cannot
be rerun to verify whether historical empirical reality would have reflected the outputs yielded
by the imperfect models that informed containment policies (Eker 2020, Ioannidis et al. 2020,
Panovska-Griffiths 2020,). 5 Nor we will ever know whether current forecasting scenarios
would live up to the test of future empirical evidence, because governments will surely adjust
their policies, in one or another direction, depending on them. But let us consider the following
counterfactual: what if governments had not followed expert advice, even when it was based
on models readily available, and in spite of their flaws? What if they had postponed critical
decisions until more suitable models were ready?
The key argument here is that thousands of lives could have been lost, if we have had to rely
on more suitable models that still had to be calibrated to adjust to a new contagion agent. Some
4
Kay and King (2020) have recovered an old debate between two extreme understandings of the risk-uncertainty
dyad in economic analysis and economic policy, a debate presumably lost by the proponents of the perspective
that Knight (1921) and Keynes (1921) pioneered a century ago. The perspective that won the debate, and is
challenged again by the authors, marked profoundly the course of the economics discipline in the second half of
the 20th century. For that perspective uncertainty can be fully described through the derivation of probability
distributions for alternative outcomes of present actions and, more generally, that the world can be predictable in
a scientific law-like way, through formal (and elegant) axiomatic reasoning and mathematical modelling. See also
the views expressed by North (2005) that the terms had previously undergone some semantic alteration with
uncertainty coming to refer what Knight meant by risk and the term ambiguity coming to refer to what Knight
meant by uncertainty. In that view, the conceptual boundary between risk and uncertainty blurs. Uncertainty is
considered as fully describable through probabilistic reasoning (as when used to formalize games of chance), and
risk as a descriptor of uncertainty that can be minimized through a reiteration of probabilistic reasoning in order
to discover alternative outcomes and their frequencies (as when games are repeatedly played). That approach
claims that we know more about the future than we actually do, assumes that we can assign probability
distributions to radical uncertainty and excludes the possibility for “unknown unknowns” (i.e., the realm of
phenomena for which there are no precedents and are therefore hard to imagine).
5
In the most relevant cases (Ferguson et al. 2020, Ioannidis et al. 2020) those models were wrong in orders of
magnitude and supposedly flawed (see e.g., Ball 2020 for a scrutiny of Ferguson’s et al. modeling approach).

6

of those models, based on the probabilistic understanding of heavy-tailed phenomena (e.g.,
Extreme Value Theory), allow for enhanced inferences about the complex, clustering, and nonlinear nature of outbreak-epidemic-pandemic dynamics in a hyper-connected world (see e.g.,
Bar-Yam 2020, Cirillo and Taleb 2020, Moore 2020, Norman et al. 2020). Moreover, those
models are explicit (and overtly honest) about key philosophical underpinnings (e.g., naïve
empiricism; Norman et al. 2020), and factor in measures (e.g., standard contact tracing, doorto-door monitoring of symptomatic carriers) that, despite being culturally contentious in some
countries, could have supported less-stringent containment measures (e.g., Shen et al. 2020).
However, current models, whether compartmental or complexity-based, are not yet able to
represent the full complexity of biophysical and socio-technical realities, and of behavioral
responses to that reality. There might be failures at technological (e.g., faulty technology for
testing-and-tracing; Woloshin et al. 2020) and medical (e.g., diagnostic errors contributing to
harm in health care; Gandhi and Singh 2020) levels. Moreover, there is still high uncertainty
about how post-recovery immune protection and environmental and seasonal influences affect
transmission dynamics (Kissler et al. 2020). And, on top of that, social reality is affected by
ideology, politics and power dynamics, which, in turn, are characterized by cultural differences
and reflexivity, so the questions arise: how can those models a priori account for strategic
ambiguity at political level, for cultural differences in elderly care, for differences in citizens’
compliance with public health measures in situations of social unrest, or for the promotion of
untested (or even worse, deadly) remedies from authoritative sources? My view is that all these
questions and epistemic tensions can turn more productive, informative and realistic if they are
informed by the three epistemological notions that I describe next through an exercise of
scientific foresight.
3.

Modulating contingency, adaptive inference and blue uncertainty

To frame my argument, I will rely on the criteria that an event or outcome must fulfil to become
a “black swan” (Taleb 2007), seizing the power of the concept to think in probabilistic terms
in order to introduce what I understand by ‘modulating contingency’—I am not seeking
confirmation that COVID-19 constituted a “black swan” event. 6 If we think in through blackswanness criteria (see Table 1), our assessments about the predictability of the pandemic after
the fact become, consciously or unconsciously, structured within a specific epistemological
tension between two extreme senses of contingency (Fig. 2). Between them, a continuum of
predictability unfolds, with randomness equating a high level of unpredictability and
contingency a property that can be modulated (Méndez et al. 2019).

My view, as that of Taleb (see e.g., Avishai 2020), is that COVID-19 is not a “black swan”. However, upon
outbreak, the pandemic resembled the features of that concept, more as an uninformed perception of the
contemporary observer, than as the informed opinion of the same observer later in time, able to better substantiate
her judgments from the vantage point of retrospective analysis.
6

7

Figure 2. Epistemological tension between two senses of contingency (based on Mahoney 2000, Eagle 2005,
Méndez et al. 2019).

Applying those notions to COVID-19, an initial sense of randomness can be understood as a
contingency signal emerging as the fact is known, at some point between November and
December 2019, i.e., the situation resonates with the criteria defining a black swan (point A,
Fig. 1). Then, the contingency signal fluctuates subjectively, depending on the epistemology at
work (e.g., theories and models used by expert advisory groups), but is generally decreasing as
new evidences are gathered, knowledge generated, and results and insights shared and
discussed across the policy and scientific communities (signal decreasing toward point B, Fig.
1). Using terms from Kay and King (2020), we enter a stage of solving “mysteries” imbued
with vagueness and indeterminacy, and the best we can do is asking “what is going on here”
and start framing the problem “by identifying the critical factors and applying some sense of
how these factors have interacted in the past and might interact in the present or future”.
Making use of abductive reasoning and retrospective methods (e.g., counterfactual
experiments, retrospective analysis), a number of competing theories, models and explanations
start to emerge about, for example: the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 through its sylvatic phase,
its “zoonotic jump” and stochastic latency and amplification phases, the evolution of the
epidemic into a pandemic, and the impact and prevention of the latter through the lens of
multiple disciplines. We are in a stage during which we start structuring the systemic risks that
we were facing, and progress toward a clear distinction between (1) the known unknowns
(aleatory uncertainty, e.g., past knowledge describe regular outbreaks and potential predictors,
but they are subject to probabilistic variability), and (2) the unknown unknowns (epistemic
uncertainty, e.g., every virus evolution and outbreak dynamics are so different that the effect
of potential predictors and contextual differences might vary enormously).
At some point, we enter the so-called “new normal” and knowledge development enter a new
stage in which it starts to settle—as Kay and King (2020) would put it, we have many of the
pieces of the “puzzle” and start putting them together. At that stage, though, epistemic
uncertainty is still very high, because the unknown unknowns still abound. During the postpandemic, we will face, at least, two main scenarios regarding contingency and uncertainty. In
the first scenario (C.1; Fig. 1), we have failed to assemble whole systems, transdisciplinary
teams working to solve Anthropocene risk challenges, so there is still great epistemic
uncertainty and the contingency signal remains dependent on subjective judgement. In a
8

second, best case scenario (C.2; Fig. 1), we have successfully assembled whole systems
transdisciplinary teams able to address Anthropocene risk from a holistic perspective, so we
progress to minimize uncertainties and systemic risk to the utmost. We have kept contingency
controlled at low levels, due to the collaboration of diverse stakeholders and multiple
disciplines conceptualizing, observing, understanding or generating knowledge in general
about the same problem, combining diverse perspectives and epistemological lenses. These
teams and communities work and reason through frameworks similar to adaptive inference
(Holling and Allen 2002), which can be used as a long-range protocol to develop and test
competing perspectives, theories, models and hypotheses. These are tested step wise as
information is collected through iterative empirical research, until they reach a maturation
point, and our assumptions are challenged as we increase our learning and improve our
conceptual thinking (Fig. 3). Since this scientific progress would be happening in the realms
of basic blue-sky research with the main aim of reducing the systemic risks associated to the
Anthropocene, I have coined the term ‘blue uncertainty’ (Fig. 1) to refer to a type of
randomness inherent in the world that perhaps we will be never able to eliminate from our
causal theories, predictions and models (based on Mahoney 2000).
Although the call for this kind of approaches is not new (Angelstam 2013, Brandt 2013), a
greater diffusion and upscaling of complexity-based transdisciplinary approaches into the
policy process has become more urgent than ever (Mallee 2020, OECD 2020). Taking a holistic
approach that addresses the fundamental drivers of COVID-19 and current systemic risks, and
involves those directly suffering the consequences of global environmental change, seems
inescapable. It is true that such an approach poses fundamental challenges at both philosophical
level (e.g., epistemological tensions between prediction—as in coin tossing—and
understanding—as in puzzle solving) and governance level (e.g., who is to be involved, how
decisions will be made, and power asymmetries or conflicts resolved). However, we can rely
on the experience and know-how that existing complexity- and systems-based scholarship has
accumulated during the last decades working hand in hand with practitioners, stakeholders, and
the civil society, in a myriad of participatory initiatives on the ground 7. For assembling these
teams and their broader communities, and decide on just and equitable compositions and
structures, a multiplicity of legitimate approaches can be followed. Recent advancements
highlight the key role of knowledge co-production involving multiple groups of people with
diverse needs and interests, to address the current planetary conditions that threaten social and
ecological wellbeing (Norström et al. 2020, Vincent et al. 2020).
With a focus on the policy process and the co-production of knowledge, whole systems
transdisciplinary teams and communities must have the following features (based on Cairney
2020, Molas-Gallart et al. 2020, Norström et al. 2020):

Examples that swiftly come to mind are sustainability science, resilience, social ecology, Earth Systems
Governance, and sustainability transitions scholarship. Single disciplines, including mainstream economics, have
also been collaborating successfully with complex systems scholars for decades (e.g., Arrow et al. 1996, Sachs et
al. 2019), although sometimes complexity economists strikingly continue to miss the opportunity to integrate
nature more holistically into their analyses, frameworks and models (e.g., Arthur et al. 2019).

Context-driven and place-based, to appropriately address the surrounding socialecological circumstances, governance levels and spatiotemporal scales.
Inclusive and pluralistic, acknowledging power dynamics and diverse ways of doing
and knowing (e.g., feminist theory, traditional ecological knowledge).
Problem-focused and reflective, allowing for developing collective understandings of
challenges through iterative mechanisms for incorporating learning from new
information gathered, knowledge generated and feedback received, and embracing
uncertainty and surprise.
Shifting the learning focus from hierarchic mode (based on the authority of powerful
actors, irrespective of their knowledge), to other modes making uncertainty,
knowledge and power relationships explicit on demand: bargaining mode (situations
of low uncertainty and rich repertoires of solutions that are negotiated); reflection
mode (high uncertainty and no single expert authoritative source, obliging actors to
reflect on competing sources); or epistemic mode (high uncertainty reduced through
strong interactions between policy makers, stakeholders and an authoritative body of
knowledge) (see Cairney 2020:211).
Formative in their approaches to policy evaluation, conducting policy design,
implementation and the very process of evaluation through processes of co-design and
co-creation with the community of stakeholders, and making failure and the whole
policy process an opportunity to learn from experience and to challenge different
theories and perspectives.

From the science side, an improved understanding of the multiple dimensions of COVID-19
and, in general, global environmental change and the management of their associated systemic
risks, requires a well-tuned balance of researchers from different disciplines of the social,
natural and health sciences. For example, going beyond the usual suspects, the inclusion of
behavioral scientists could help to understand whether or not different types of cognitive biases
(e.g., probability neglect—related riskier individual behaviors—, or omission bias—related to
the refusal to get vaccinated) are at play at individual, collective or political levels, and to what
extent do they affect policy actions that can tip the scales in one direction or the other at critical,
threshold moments (Halpern et al. 2020, Sieroń 2020). Also, there are still scarce integrated
studies about the effects of compliance with introduced prevention, contention or lock-down
measures at different times of the pandemic, or about the influence of spatial, density and
mobility factors (e.g., distance from outbreak epicenters, connectivity and clustering)—mainly
due to a combination of a dearth of data and poor operationalization of variables from a
comprehensive, interdisciplinary perspective (Bontempi et al. 2020).
Multi-sectoral collaborations focusing on health and social care, could result in improved
education and training regarding hygiene routines and infection control measures, and an
increase in the use of digital technology to monitor medication adherence and enhance
psychosocial well-being, especially of older people and their families (Baxter et al. 2020).
Indeed, the WHO has recently issued a framework document to support member states in the
prevention of “pandemic fatigue”, calling for going beyond the biomedical sciences towards
strategies to maintain and reinvigorate public support, informed by public health, societal,
11

cultural and economic considerations” and ensuring that “no one is left behind” (WHO 2020).
In general, in this scheme, while the biomedical and health-related disciplines focus on more
granular factors (e.g., genes, disease, treatments), the social or social-ecological disciplines
focus on understanding the big picture (e.g., socio-economic effects of the pandemic,
relationship between land-use change and zoonoses, regional resilience and vulnerability to
external shocks).
4.

The normative side

My approach is contingent on a global concerted “mental leap” (Lee 2012) toward a narrative
focusing on robustness and resilience in complex systems à la Kay and King (2020) that then
might morph into a more sophisticated one fully unpacking the Earth-system and socialecological aspects of complexity-based approaches such as One Health or Anthropocene risk
à la Keys et al. (2019)—or any other approach focusing on the complex, intertwined and
uncertain relationship between people and nature. Normatively, such a leap must thoroughly
consider three interrelated and complementary principles. First, we need a more robust
understanding of the global governance architecture required, though a framework that
integrates upfront the complexity of social-ecological systems, considers the structure—how
the past constraints innovation at present—and agency—our capacity to innovate and shape
the future—dualism in a flexible way, and warrants interoperability with other complexitybased approaches (Biermann and Kim 2020). Second, complexity modelling must consider the
multidimensional relationship between social inequality and the intertwined dynamics of
social-ecological systems, which occur across multiple spatial, temporal, and organizational
levels (Hamman et al. 2018), and is affected by power asymmetries and actors with strong
vested interests that are able to effortlessly influence (undesirable) systemic policy outcomes
(Österblom et al. 2015, Gaffney et al. 2018). Last, but not least, as part of a wider process of
democratization of public health policy, our mental leap must be accompanied by a vigorous
involvement of stakeholders in the co-production of knowledge about zoonotic diseases
(Bardosh et al. 2017). In my view, the activation of these three principles would increase the
likelihood of reaching broad consensuses and the social legitimation that the coming difficult
decisions to be made and tough trade-offs to be tackled will need, based on a shared
understanding of the ecological, socio-political and power dynamics underlying pandemics.
5.

Conclusion

Here, I have proposed an approach that can serve as an intermediary enabling the use of
innovative complexity-based approaches in policy making aimed at assessing and managing
Anthropocene risk. It is constituted by three core components operating at philosophical
(modulating contingency), methodological (adaptive inference) and epistemic (blue
uncertainty) levels. I argue that the power of my approach relies on its resonating properties
with the mainstream mindset pervading current policy making in general, which emphasizes a
focus on prediction and control regarding the resolution of high uncertainty situations and
“wicked problems”, and is pervaded by a reductionist epistemology that is ill-equipped to deal
with complex global systemic risks. My approach can be useful for policy and decision makers
12

facing situations like COVID-19 or, more generally, global environmental change, which
characterized by radical uncertainty and ambiguity, for three main reasons. First, they make
explicit two interrelated tensions: (1) the one created by the notion of contingency, hence the
usefulness of richer frameworks including theories, propositions and perspectives from a more
diverse range of modes of knowing for dealing with uncertainty; (2) the one created by the risk
and uncertainty dyad as understood above, hence the critical importance of setting an epistemic
limit between the two in order to prevent the turning of what we do not know—a radical
uncertainty—into a manageable risk—for naïve reasons or, more grievously, due to political
ambiguity or the influence of powerful actors. Second, frameworks similar to the adaptive
inference protocol confer policy making and knowledge co-production an indispensable degree
of flexibility and a learning function to deal with radical uncertainty, through a methodological
capability to robustly progress from an initial blooming of competing theories, explanations
and perspectives, to a narrower set of plausible ones in a participatory way. Finally, blue
uncertainty pretends to inspire us to keep on working in solving the puzzles that threaten our
social and ecological wellbeing, but raising awareness of our epistemic fallibility, or our
cognitive limitations to reduce what, in the end, might truly be pure randomness in reality or
our models of it.
