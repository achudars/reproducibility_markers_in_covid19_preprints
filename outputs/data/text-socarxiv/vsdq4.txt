Explaining Inequalities of Homeschooling in Germany
during the first COVID-19 Lockdown

Abstract
Current studies suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic is worsening existing social inequalities in the
field of education worldwide. We argue that the pandemic is especially challenging for students from
socially disadvantaged and educationally deprived homes as parental engagement and resources are
hugely important to guide and support the learning process during the school closure period.
To examine how well parents were able to help their children with schoolwork during the
homeschooling period in Germany, we used data from the German National Educational Panel Study
(NEPS) collected during the first homeschooling period in May/June 2020. Taking known mechanisms
of inequality of educational opportunity into account, we explore the effects of parents’ aspirations
and cultural, social, and economic capital on the ability to help their children.
Our results show that although the majority of parents were able to provide good support with
schoolwork, we found the expected inequalities due to social background. Low educated parents are
twice as likely to be unable to provide sufficient support compared to highly educated parents. In our
multivariate analyses, family resources show a significant positive effect on the likelihood that parents
were able to help.
Moreover, regardless of the social or cultural capital endowment of the parents, good technical
equipment in the household is associated with a higher probability of support. Thus, ensuring technical
home equipment could be a way to promote an educationally supportive learning environment across
all social groups.

1. Introduction
Schools in Germany were nationwide closed in mid-March for most of the remaining school year due
to the COVID-19 pandemic. With just a few days' notice, teachers, parents, and students were faced
with an unprecedented, sudden challenge. While for parents of young children the care burden
increased immensely during this time, schools had to continue to fulfil their educational mission and
improvise new, digital and analogue learning and teaching concepts at distance. Various studies show
that this had fundamentally changed the everyday life of families: Children of elementary school age
had on average significantly fewer social contacts outside their core family but spent more time with
television, streaming services, or YouTube (Langmeyer et al., 2020, pp. 11-16) while secondary school
students were much more likely to use digital learning tools such as educational software than before
the pandemic (Wolter et al., 2020). Thus, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the learning environment of
students changed significantly. Both teachers and researchers see this as a danger that existing
educational inequalities in Germany will worsen (Eickelmann & Drossel, 2020; Huebener, Spieß & Zinn,
2020; Wößmann et al., 2020).
In particular, research findings on the so-called Summer Learning Loss give an idea of how the effect
of the loss of educational spaces at school varies according to social background. Studies, especially in
the USA, show that children from socially disadvantaged families predominantly regress in their
competence development during the summer holidays, while children from socially privileged families
remain at their level or even make progress - this happens, for example, through different access to
resources such as books (Cooper et al., 1996; Alexander, Entwisle & Olson, 2007; Allington & McGillFranzen, 2017).
In contrast to regular summer holidays, however, education nominally continued during the pandemic.
From mid-May onwards, in most federal states in Germany, selected grades were able to partially
return to school. In Bavaria for example, this gradual opening was not completed until mid-June – only
a few weeks before the summer break. Including the regular Easter and Whitsun holidays, pupils were
in total out of their usual learning environment for up to three months. Students in other European
countries found themselves in a similar situation during the first wave. At the time of this writing, the
second wave of the pandemic is ongoing and this pattern seems to repeat. Due to more limited
opportunities for parents from socio-economically disadvantaged families and more limited access to
educational resources (e.g. reading opportunities), the Joint Research Centre of the European
Commission predicted an increase in educational inequality for all member states (EU Commission,
2020).

How does this "COVID-19 shock" affect educational inequality in Germany? At this point, the
homeschooling situation receives a lot of attention. But studies on the situation at home are still
lacking (for an exception see Wolter et al., 2020).
This article aims to explore the heterogeneous learning settings during this forced homeschooling. We
focus on social inequality of educational opportunity, i.e. how well parents were able to help their
children with schoolwork during the homeschooling period. We argue that the COVID-19 pandemic is
especially challenging for students from socially disadvantaged and educationally deprived homes, as
parental engagement and resources are hugely important to guide and support the learning process
during the school closure period. Furthermore, we argue that socially differential parental support
(during the pandemic) can be explained by mechanisms of inequality of educational opportunity
known from the sociology of education.
We use data from the Starting Cohort 2 (Kindergarten children, henceforth: SC2) of the German
National Educational Panel Study (NEPS).3 In an online supplementary survey, 1,587 parents of
approximately 14-year-old pupils were asked in May and June 2020 about their situation during COVID19 (Weiß, 2020). Not only information on family life during the school closing period is considered in
our analyses, but also information on the family from previous waves of this longitudinal study. In
addition to the mechanisms of social inequality mentioned above, especially the technical equipment
of the household (such as laptops or Wi-Fi) will receive attention.
Since there is currently no broad database for Germany with which to explore the consequences of
the pandemic on actual skills development, this article provides further evidence on the extent to
which school closures have significant consequences for educational inequality.

2. State of research
2.1 Educational inequalities during the COVID-19 pandemic and the role of resources
Across Europe, several researchers have already focused on the issue of education during the COVID19 pandemic. Results from Dutch researchers showed that students made very little progress through
learning at home during the COVID-19 pandemic and were even partially affected by learning losses this was especially the case for students whose parents have a low level of education (Engzell et al.,
2020). Similar findings could be seen in Belgium, where learning losses were highest in schools with a
higher number of socio-economically disadvantaged pupils (Maladonado & De Witte, 2020). Results
from the UK Household Longitudinal Study showed that children at risk of poverty received
quantitatively more parental support with their schoolwork during the lockdown, but at the same time
more often did not have access to a computer at home (20% vs. 7%) which precluded them from taking
part in online courses. As a possible explanation for the extended duration of support, the author
considered more time of parents due to unemployment (Green, 2020: 10). The issue of parental help
with schoolwork has also been addressed based on data from the Dutch LISS panel (Bol, 2020), showing
that highly educated parents provided more support with schoolwork and felt more capable to do so.
Additionally, they had more school-relevant resources at home, such as computers.
That in particular socially privileged parental homes were able to maintain a conducive learning
environment is shown by Jaeger and Blaabaek (2020) from Denmark: They analyzed the borrowing of
digital children's books from libraries during the school closure period and found a significantly higher
borrowing rate according to higher income and higher education. The authors see this as an indicator
of different educational opportunities for pupils and therefore also suspect an increase in educational
inequality. Regarding the degree of support from parents during homeschooling, an Austrian study of
250 secondary school students found no considerable difference according to the students' level of
competence (Ringeltaube-Stadler, 2020).
Even though there has not yet been a comprehensive analysis of the performance development of
pupils in Germany during the school closure phase, there are already structurally large differences
compared to the conditions before the pandemic: In general, children in Germany spent less time
learning during the school closure phase than during the school period (Wößmann, 2020; Wacker et
al., 2020; Grewenig et al., 2020). The reduction in learning time is greater for pupils with lower
competencies than for those with higher competencies (Grewenig et al., 2020). Researchers fear that
especially low-competence pupils could be severely negatively affected in their educational

4

development by school closures, as they are on average more likely to live in less favorable conditions
at home and parents are less able to support them with their schoolwork (Huebener & Schmitz, 2020).
An increase in social inequality can also be expected for Germany, considering that even before the
pandemic, socially privileged parents were able to better support their children with their homework
(Anger & Plünnecke, 2020). Studies show that the amount of time parents spend helping with
schoolwork does not differ according to social background (Luplow & Smidt, 2019; Lee & Bowen, 2006),
but the quality of this help does (O'Sullivan et al., 2014; Dumont, 2012).

2.2 Summer Learning Loss Research and Holiday Effects in Germany
School closures and homeschooling have led to a radical change in the learning environment of
students. The setting has become much more heterogeneous and its structuring depends more than
ever on the parental home. Findings from the research on the Summer Learning Loss show the effect
of longer, heterogenized learning and living environments on socially differential competence
development of pupils. US studies in particular revealed that summer holidays can influence the
competence development of pupils. Although previous findings are not entirely consistent, as there
are also studies for the USA that were able to demonstrate inconsistent or no effects of summer
holidays on competence development (e.g. Hippel & Hamrock, 2019), many studies find empirical
evidence - especially differences in competence development according to socio-economic status.
These studies demonstrate that socially disadvantaged students have less positive competence
developments than socially privileged students (Downey et al., 2004; Entwisle & Alexander, 1992;
Alexander, Entwisle, & Olson, 2007; Quinn et al, 2016).
To investigate this social disparity, the "faucet theory" by Entwisle, Alexander, and Olson (2000) is
relevant, which explains the social differences in competence development by the different access to
resources such as books and the socially divergent learning environments. This theory is supported by
recent findings such as those of Allington and McGill-Franzen (2017) from the UK, who found far more
limited access to books during the summer holidays for children from lower-income families than for
socially privileged pupils.
So far, for Germany, the limited studies on Summer Learning Loss do not reveal a clear picture. On the
one hand, some studies found a loss of competence over the holidays, but no socially divergent
differences (e.g. Coelen & Siewert, 2008a; Coelen & Siewert, 2008b). Other studies show differences
according to socio-economic characteristics (Siewert & Coelen, 2020; Siewert, 2013). These
inconclusive results are associated with the comparatively short duration of holidays in Germany
5

(Coelen & Siewert, 2008: 339f.). In the USA, the summer holidays are about four weeks longer. Results
for other European countries appear similarly heterogeneous, for example Austrian researchers find
differences in competence development according to social status (Jauch, 2018; Paechter et al., 2015);
while Lindahl (2001) could not prove this for Sweden. While Sweden has about the same length of
summer holidays as Germany, the holidays in Austria are 2-3 weeks longer.
Using Summer Learning Loss as a starting point, an US research team designed predictive models for
the development of skills during school closures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. However,
the researchers did not take homeschooling and teacher support into account and only assume a
longer school closure period instead (Kuhfeld et al., 2020: p. 23). Even though important factors are
therefore not included, the results indicate the immense potential consequences. The researchers
assume that annual learning gains in reading and especially mathematics skills will be significantly
lower than in previous years (ibid.: 23). The models also suggest that the spectrum of skills is likely to
widen and heterogenize - because even over the 'typical' summer holidays, the highest-performing
30% of students improve their reading skills, while a share of the students declines immensely in
reading (ibid.: 23).
So, on the one hand, there is the phenomenon of a decline in competence during the summer holidays,
which is, however, little researched in Germany. On the other hand, an extraordinary situation is
currently taking place that is likely to increase educational inequalities, but little is known about its
actual consequences so far. This work addresses this research gap.

3. Theoretical framework and hypotheses
Social inequality of educational opportunity stems from different chances to succeed in any given
educational situation (primary effect of social origin) and different educational choices, especially at
transitions in the educational system (secondary effect of social origin) (Boudon, 1974).
The students, who otherwise spend a considerable part of their everyday life in the institution of school
and whose learning settings are thus up to a point similar, were exposed to much more heterogeneous
learning environments during the school closures. They spent much more time in the family, which
allowed primary origin effects to have a stronger impact. According to the sociological literature on
the inequality of educational opportunity, several mechanisms can be expected to impact parental
support during homeschooling:

6

Educational aspirations: Parents who have high educational aspirations for their children are more
inclined to invest in supporting their children regularly (Haller, 1968; Ditton & Krüsken, 2010; Paulus &
Blossfeld, 2007). Parents with a high social status have higher aspirations for their children due to the
motive of status maintenance (Breen & Goldthorpe, 1997). Thus, ceteris paribus, it can be assumed
that high status parents are more prone to invest more in supporting homeschooling.
Cultural capital: Based on the assumption that socially less privileged parents have less educationally
relevant capital (Bourdieu, 1986), it can be assumed that these parents will be less able to support
their children with their schoolwork and with the special challenges of homeschooling, e.g. being able
to explain the educational content or to provide support with technical equipment (hard- and software
side), specialist knowledge on learning strategies, how to structure learning environment and learning
time, or how to use the provided learning resources most effectively.
Social capital: Social and social norms also play a role (Coleman, 1988) as, depending on the type and
quality of the relationship, learning groups may be formed or the parents may adapt their actions to
an environment that is conducive or even obstructive to education. Parents with more social capital
can get necessary information from other parents or teachers or can arrange for private (paid or
unpaid) tutoring.
Economic capital: Usually educational success is not very dependent on economic resources in
Germany as even higher education is virtually free. However, as homeschooling is mainly happening
via online learning platforms and tools, the amount of connected devices that are suitable for remote
learning (mainly PCs or tablets) becomes important. Since schooling before the pandemic was virtually
completely analog, parents of poorer families who had not enough hardware like computers for all
household members or with less money to spend on new ones, had a more difficult position.
Furthermore, poorer families live in smaller apartments providing less space for all members to
remotely learn and work.
Additional to these mechanisms of social inequality of educational opportunity, there is another
important factor to consider: Parental working conditions. Parents with a higher social status often
have occupations (e.g. classical white-collar jobs) that allow them to work from home or work flexible
hours and are more able to help their children during homeschooling while lower status jobs (e.g.
manual labour) cannot as easily be reconciled with helping their children. To understand the effects of
social origin on parental support, parental working conditions have to be controlled for.4

4

Interdependencies between the mechanisms are theoretically implied and known from the literature, but not
essential in this context.

7

Taking these arguments together, we propose the following model to explain differential parental
support during homeschooling (see Figure 1).
Figure 1. Mechanisms of social inequality of parental support during homeschooling

Own illustration.

Based on this theoretical model as well as findings from previous research, we can derive the following
hypotheses:
1. Parental support during homeschooling is dependent on the social origin of the family, i.e.
parents with a higher social status could provide more help during the pandemic.
2. The effect of social origin on parental support is mediated by educational relevant capital
endowment, educational aspirations, conditional on parental working conditions.

4. Data and Methods
4.1 Data
To test our hypotheses, the empirical analyses are based on data from the German National Education
Panel Study (NEPS) (Blossfeld et al., 2011). The NEPS has been collecting longitudinal individual panel
data in a multi-cohort-sequence design since 2008 with a focus on education and learning
environments, performance, and sociodemographic background of the family. For the present study,
Starting Cohort 2 (Kindergarten; SC2) was used (data version 9-0-0) (Skopek et al., 2012). The original
target population for the SC2 were all children around age four attending a kindergarten in 2010/11.
Up to 2020, eleven yearly surveys were conducted with children and their parents. Furthermore, an
additional NEPS survey was conducted in May and June 2020 during the first wave of the COVID-19
pandemic. This addendum contained relevant information about the situation during the time of crisis
and how the living and learning situation has changed for pupils and their parents. This survey was
carried out online (CAWI) from May 13 2020 to June 22 2020 (Weiß 2020). This means the items were
gathered directly after the peak of the COVID-19 incidence rate, marking the most critical phase of the
first wave of the epidemic in Germany and COVID-19. At this time, all schools and other educational
institutions were closed. It must be acknowledged that this extra survey generated a lower response
rate than usual waves (realization rate 27.3 %) which can be attributed to the online and selfadministered form of the study (no interviewer present), the unexpected date (unplanned extrasurvey), the special pandemic situation) and the much lower survey time (less than six weeks to
participate in the study).

4.2 Operationalization
The central dependent variable of all models is whether the parents were able to help their child with
the schoolwork during the COVID-19 lockdown (“I was not able to help my child with the schoolwork”).
The answer was measured on a five-point Likert-scale from 1 “does not apply at all” to 5 “does fully
apply”. For a more intuitive interpretation of the results, we reversed the scale so higher numerical
values describe a higher propensity to be able to help the child with the schoolwork.
The social origin of the family is measured using the International Socio-Economic Index of
Occupational Status (ISEI) score (taken from the parent with the higher score, if both are available) as
a continuous variable. The ISEI incorporates the occupational prestige of a person and therefore
includes aspects like income, educational level, and social position. For a more convenient
9

interpretation in multivariate analyses, we z-standardized this variable so effects can be expressed in
standard deviations from the mean.
Next, we introduce the hypothesized mediating variables. To measure cultural capital we used the
overall number of books in the household, measured in three categories (0- 100, 101 to 200, more
than 200) and the parental educational background. We categorised the information about the
highest educational certificate of the parents into three groups (no degree, lower degree, or
intermediate degree (max. Mittlere Reife), higher education eligibility (Abitur), or any tertiary degree).
We see this variable not only as an indicator and mediator of parents' knowledge and skills but also as
one of educational orientation.
The overall social capital of the parents is measured using a positional generator indicating whether
parents know friends or acquaintances with certain occupations (for example, lawyers, medical
doctors, teachers, or nurses; see Schulz et al., 2017). From this information, a z-standardized scale is
constructed with a mean of zero indicating an average social capital.
As an indicator for economic capital we use the overall satisfaction with the technical equipment at
home that is required for learning, like having access to a quiet place to study, a computer, or other
materials. Parents rated the sufficiency of the equipment on a four-point Likert-scale.
The final theoretically motivated mediator is whether parents have high idealistic educational
aspirations for their child, i.e. that they aspire to higher education entrance qualification (Abitur) or
not.
To account for potential spurious correlations, we defined a set of control variables. As presented
above in figure 1, Parental working conditions are an important factor and therefore considered in
the following categories: whether the parents work from home, partly from home, or not from home
at all (during the lockdown).
Further control variables are the age of the child in 2020 (measured in years), the gender of the child,
whether there is any migration background of the child or not, the type of track currently attended by
the child (academic track (Gymnasium), comprehensive school (Gesamtschule), any other track
(Grundschule / Hauptschule / Realschule), whether the family lives in West or East Germany (including
Berlin) and whether the parents are living together or not, the monitoring of the parents, the time the
child studies for school, the time the parents support the child, the motivation of the child and the
place the responding parent works from during the crisis. Previous parental support is measured with
an item from 2015/16 that indicates the overall support parents have for their children regarding the
homework (“How often do you support your child with the homework”) with answers given on a fivepoint scale (“never” to “always”). In addition, we use a second item that measures the hours parents
10

help their child working on school-related aspects per week during the lockdown. Overall motivation
is measured by the time the child spends working for school (hours per week during lockdown) and
with a second item that measures how difficult it is to motivate the child during lockdown to work for
school at home (five-point Likert-scale).

4.3 Methods
We used a nested and step-wise model building to both test the significance of the added variables
and to see whether this reduces the effect of our central independent variable, the social origin, which
hints at a mediation process. In total, we utilized eight nested models to which we added new variables
in blocks. The dependent variable was always whether parents could help their child during lockdown
with schoolwork. The design is as follows:
First, the empty model (baseline) only includes the measure of social origin, which is the ISEI of the
parents as a continuous variable. The second model adds all sociodemographic control variables. The
following models add the theorized mediators. Finally, a complete model was computed, including all
variables and mediators simultaneously.
We ran linear (OLS) regression models in this stepwise fashion. However, to test the robustness of our
findings, we did multiple robustness checks. First, since the dependent variable is originally scaled on
a five-point Likert scale, we ran ordinal logistic models. Second, we computed results for sub-samples
of all children depending on their academic performance. For this, we used the competence tests of
the NEPS which measure the performance of the child in both mathematics and German. We divided
the sample at the median to form two groups (low and high performers) to see whether results differed
by competence level of the children in addition to a model which included all children independent of
performance. We compared results for both mathematics and German but found no substantial
differences.5
All analyses were computed in Stata 16.1. To account for missing information due to nonresponse, we
imputed the data multiply (MICE) and use m = 100 imputations. We also imputed the dependent
variable and included all observations since various auxiliary variables and weights were included to
control for selection and sampling design (Sullivan et al., 2015). Using only the non-imputed sample
we find comparative results that do not lead to different conclusions. Only respondents were included
in the following analyses that participated in the last regular survey wave nine. By doing so we ensure
that information is available on all relevant background variables, like SES, for the large majority of all

participants. Hence, we regard wave nine as the anchor that serves as a baseline for imputing the
critical COVID-19 information, where much less information is available.
Table 1 gives a descriptive overview of all variables. For a better understanding of the relationship with
social status, we also provide a comparison between two extreme groups (low social status VS high
social status) in the appendix (see Table A1)

Figure 2: Ability to help by SES of the family (ISEI)

Data: NEPS SC2 (doi:10.5157/NEPS:SC2:9.0.0). Own Illustration, imputed data m = 100. Higher numerical values
on the x-axis indicate a higher propensity to being able to help the child with the schoolwork. The white lines
inside the box plots indicate the group median.

On average, parents were overall able to support their children relatively well (arithmetic mean: 3.72).
To test Hypothesis 1, we start by looking at the bivariate relation between our outcome variable (being
able to help) and the social status of the family. As depicted in Figure 2, we found the theorized
relationship as parents with higher values on ISEI were more able to help (higher numerical value on
the x-axis) have.
Next, Table 2 shows the results from the multivariate analysis. We start with the baseline model (M1)
that only includes the parental ISEI, continue by adding all control variables in the next model (M2),
and then proceed by testing each mediator individually (M3-M7) and complete the analyses with the
saturated model including all mediators (M8).

In M1, we found that ISEI exerts a statistically positive influence, meaning that the ability to help
increases by 0.123 points when ISEI increases by one standard deviation. This result supports our first
hypothesis about the positive relationship between social status and parental support during
homeschooling.
When adding all controls in M2, the effect of ISEI only slightly weakened. High parental aspirations did
not have an independent effect on the ability to help (M3), while technical equipment does (M4). The
same holds for all other mediators tested afterwards. The smaller the effect of ISEI becomes, the
stronger the mediating pathway. When looking at this metric, especially the number of books and the
parental education level were strong mediators since the effect of ISEI was almost reduced to zero
15

when including them (M6 and M7). When testing all mediators simultaneously, we found that the
effect of ISEI was very close to zero and not statistically significant as well. Since multiple mediators
did have statistically significant effects we can conclude that they work partly independent of each
other. We observe that the effect of working conditions decreased when the mediators were taken
into account but remained significant. This suggests that, as hypothesised, the place of work does
depend on social status, but in addition to this, it has an independent contribution to the explanation
of parental help with schoolwork. Therefore, we can accept our second hypothesis on the mechanisms
of social inequality.

6. Discussion
During the COVID-19 lockdown and the resulting school closures, the learning and living environments
of students changed fundamentally. This article aimed to explore what these heterogenized learning
environments meant for educational inequalities in Germany. More specifically, our research interest
was to find out how well parents were able to help their children with schoolwork during the
homeschooling period, depending on the following socio-economic factors and resources: parental
education, books at home, parental aspirations, social capital, and sufficient technical equipment.
Based on previous findings, it could be assumed that the lack of resources of socially less privileged
students lead to an increase in educational inequalities during homeschooling periods.
To examine the extent to which the known mechanisms of social inequality are relevant during the
school closure period, we analysed data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS).
Our results show that high-status parents were more able to help their children with schoolwork. This
finding is in line with expectations since parents with a high social status, one average, have more
resources available to invest in the education of their children. They not only have higher incentives to
support their children (as explained by status maintenance motives) but are also able to actually
provide the necessary support on their own, even in critical situations like the lockdown situation.
The multivariate results revealed that especially the number of books and the parental educational
qualifications are strong mediators. This is in line with our expectations since it is well known that the
number of books as objective cultural capital is highly correlated with the educational aspirations and
orientations of the parents. Parents who invest in this capital hold high educational aspirations for
their children and invest in their educational success. The same holds for educational qualifications,
which not only strongly correlate with the number of books but also reflect the own educational
trajectories of the parents. Parents who hold high qualifications will have a strong incentive to enable
their children to reach these as well since they are aware of the exceptional influence of education on
the life course. Our results show that high parental aspirations do not have an independent effect on
the ability to help, while technical equipment and social capital do. To explain the lack of an effect of
parental aspirations, we argue that while aspirations do indeed differ across social groups (see Table
A1 in the Appendix), we could only examine whether aspirations affect parents' ability to help their
children, not whether they are motivated to do so. The fact that they can help during such an
extraordinary situation is therefore conditioned more by the actual circumstances and possibilities of
the parental home than by their aspirations. This explanation is corroborated by the result that an
independent effect can be demonstrated for the parents’ social network. In addition, this explanation
is also supported by the effect that parental working conditions have on parental help. Even when all
17

mediators are taken into account, there is a significant negative impact on parental support when
parents do not work from home. So although this is not a genuine mechanism of social inequality, this
effect shows the consequences of parents having a much more limited ability to shape their children's
learning environment. The same applies to being a single parent, which is also associated with a lower
probability of being able to help.
Even though our results are insightful, there are several limitations. First, we do not have an objective
measure of parental support. Only the self-reports of parents who assessed their support options
themselves. This self-assessment could differ by social status due to a different understanding and/or
different levels of social desirability. Also, we do not have any data from the children, who might rate
their parents' abilities differently. Secondly, the respondents of SC2 are members of a selective group,
which has already been scientifically monitored for the last ten years. This group contains a high
proportion of highly educated parents. We have tried to consider this circumstance through the use of
imputation and weighting, but it should still be taken into account when trying to generalize our
findings.
Concerning the question of what the school closures mean for educational inequalities in Germany,
our findings indicate that these inequalities may be getting stronger. Socially disadvantaged parents
have less material and immaterial resources to maintain an education-promoting learning
environment. And as the results from the Summer Learning Loss research suggest, the longer the
homeschooling phase lasts, the wider the social gap is likely to become. However, we also see that the
families' technical equipment is positively correlated with the likelihood that the parents can help their
children. Thus, providing a sufficient digital infrastructure in educational institutions would not only
help students and teachers to stay in touch, but also help parents across all social groups to maintain
an educationally supportive learning environment. From this perspective, promoting further
digitalisation in the school context would help to reduce inequalities. However, technical equipment
can only compensate for a part of the differences. Especially when it comes to imparting knowledge
or explaining specific school contents, low-educated parents are at a disadvantage. Therefore, this
group needs strong (virtual) school support to compensate for existing deficits in the learning
environment at home. Considering the unprecedented circumstances and increased workload for
teachers, this is certainly a great challenge for schools.
We believe it is likely that this inequality in parental support will also manifest itself in differences in
competence development. Further research should therefore address this issue and examine how
students’ competence developments differ according to social background. This aspect in particular
will play an immense role even after the pandemic has been contained, as educational inequalities
ultimately manifest themselves in unequal life and career trajectories.

Data: NEPS SC2 (doi:10.5157/NEPS:SC2:9.0.0). Own Illustration, imputed data. Low ISEI: lower than one
standard deviation from the mean. High ISEI: larger than one standard deviation above the mean. Significance
levels are derived from linear OLS models as an equivalent of t-tests with imputed data and should be seen as
approximations.
