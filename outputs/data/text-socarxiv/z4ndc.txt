Abstract
This paper investigates the “cultural” transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Using West Germany data we observe that in predominantly Catholic regions with
stronger social and family ties, the spread and the resulting deaths per capita were
much higher compared to non-Catholic ones at the NUTS-3 level. This finding
could help explain the rapid spread and high death toll of the virus in some European countries compared to others. Looking at di↵erences within a specific country
in a well identified setting eliminates biases due to di↵erent social structures, health
care systems, specific policies and measures, and testing procedures for the virus
that can confound estimates and hinder comparability across countries. Further,
we use individual level data as well as Apple mobility data to investigate potential mechanisms. The results highlight the cultural dimension of the spread and
could suggest the implementation of targeted mitigation measures in light of disease
outbreaks.

Introduction

Since the recent onset of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, which resulted into the COVID19 pandemic in November 2019 in Wuhan, China the virus has spread rapidly across
the globe. Italy and Spain are the countries in Europe that were hit the earliest and
hardest by April 2020, with France following suit, whereas Northern European countries
seemed to have performed better at least in the initial phase, with the exception of the
UK. As a result, and despite the relatively homogeneous containment measures (e.g.
school closures, lock-downs, social distancing etc.), the incidence and death toll vary
substantially across countries and it is difficult to uncover the reasons behind this. The
timing of both the onset of the pandemic and the policies to constrain it could clearly
play a role; for example in Sweden, Belgium or the UK. However, recent evidence suggests
that the virus was present in Europe long before it was initially believed, e.g. as early as
December 2019 in France (Deslandes et al. (2020). Yet, it spread faster in some countries
compared to others, at least in it the initial stage, resulting in vastly overburdened health
systems and excess death rates, before most governments enacted their mitigation policies.
An explanation for this phenomenon could be that social norms, lower levels of social
interactions and culturally inherent “social distancing” in some Northern societies may
have slowed the spread of the virus to vulnerable groups, e.g. the elderly (Bayer and
Kuhn (2020)). Recent evidence has demonstrated that disease transmission patterns
are crucially characterised by the interactions among people (Alfaro et al. (2020); Liu
et al. (2020); Platteau and Verardi (2020)). However, substantial di↵erences in social
structures, demographics, health systems, testing, social distancing policies and all other
forms of policy responses at di↵erent time periods render cross country comparisons rather
unhelpful. For this reason we choose to focus on a single country; Germany, where such
concerns are rather mitigated.
We observe a substantial discrepancy even at the local authority (NUTS-3) level in per
capita incidence and number of deaths between Catholic and non-Catholic regions using
daily data from the Robert Koch Institute. We confirm this using Di↵erence-in-Di↵erence
estimates at the NUTS-1 level. This could hint at a type of “cultural transmission” which
remains strong after partialling out socio-economic characteristics, geographical proximity to Northern Italy, mobility trends before the lockdowns, and regional fixed e↵ects.
Catholic regions that arguably exhibit stronger social and family ties seem to experience
a wider spread of the virus in the general -as well as the more vulnerable (or elderly)
population- as indicated by their higher death toll. Previous research in economics has
established that Catholics are more bound to close social circles and networks, e.g. family and friends, and they have di↵erent patterns of social interactions (Arruñada (2009);

2

Glaeser and Glendon (1998); Ekelund et al. (2002)). This cultural di↵erences in behaviour and social ethics can trigger a di↵erentiated transmission of the disease in the
population during early stages. We demonstrate that the COVID-19 incidence varies
systematically with religion at the regional level. The results suggest that culture leads
to di↵erent transmission rates within groups. The proposed mechanism is supported by
results using individual-level data from the European Social Survey (ESS), the European
Values Survey (EVS) and Apple mobility data that help us investigate how Catholics are
systematically and culturally di↵erent in their social and family ties, and hence uncover
a potential disease transmission channel within this group.
These results could support epidemiologists and public health policy makers to better
understand how cultural factors can largely influence the spread of pathogens in a society,
and account for these di↵erences when designing response policies as suggested by Platteau and Verardi (2020). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Section
2 we present an overview of the pandemic and policy response in Germany. Section 3
describes our identification strategy, data and results, whereas Section 4 discusses and
concludes.

Background

According to data released from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the first reported cases
of COVID-19 in Germany were recorded on 27 January 2020 in Starnberg, Bavaria and by
March all German states had reported cases. The first deaths were reported on 9 March
in North Rhine-Westphalia and by the end of the month all states confirmed hospitalized
virus-related deaths. State and federal government response was swift (Sta↵ord (2020)).
In early March the federal government and the RKI issued the National Pandemic Plan
to be carried out across the country. The states themselves were given some autonomy
in handling the pandemic, although the response was coordinated and crucial to avoid
inter-state travel. All states in Germany enacted strict social distancing measures and
closures of schools, shops and workplaces. Based on the Coronavirus Government Response Tracker developed by the University of Oxford, these social distancing measures
were implemented on February 29 (public events cancellation), March 16 (school closings), March 22 (shops and workplaces closings) and April 09 (public transport closing).
The number of daily cases peaked in early April according to the RKI and started receding from that point on. Some of the nationwide restrictions such as the closure of small
shops were lifted about three weeks later on 22 April.
In terms of testing, widespread PCR testing was made available on 25 March and
restrictions for severe cases were lifted, so that more than 2 million people received a
3

test by late April. Data on cases and deaths are collected by local authorities (NUTS-3),
reported to the Federal Ministry of Health and published by RKI after validation. As of
23 April 2020, 148,046 confirmed cases were reported as well as 5,094 deaths. Figure A.1
displays how the cumulative numbers of reported cases and deaths per 100,000 population
were scattered across the country on April 20.
This is the period we will focus on, as the initial stages of the pandemic largely determine the speed of the spread (Zhao et al. (2020)). Given the relatively long incubation
period of up to two weeks (Lauer et al. (2020)) and the large number of asymptomatic
carriers (Gudbjartsson et al. (2020), the virus can remain undetected and spread faster
in the general population during the early stage before mitigating strategies can come to
full e↵ect.

Empirical analysis

3.1

Identification Strategy

Given the large number of factors that influence the spread and toll of the disease, it
is difficult to compare across countries. However, policy responses have been rather
similar resulting in arguably varying degrees of efficiency. This can be to some extent
explained by di↵erences in societal and individual behaviour and attitudes rather than
di↵erent approaches in testing or capabilities of health care systems. Yet, our purpose is
to determine whether cultural aspects played a role.
We choose to focus within a single country on a religious divide that has been used in
the literature before to explain how cultural di↵erences may a↵ect individual behaviour
(Iannaccone (1998); Ekelund et al. (2002); Arruñada (2009); Spenkuch (2017); Spenkuch
and Tillmann (2018); Becker and Pascali (2019)). Specifically, we observe that in Germany regions with a higher share of Catholics seem to have been more severely a↵ected
by the virus, which could be explained by stronger social and family ties.1 For example,
when looking Figure A.1 in the Appendix, there is a striking similarity between how the
disease has spread and how Catholics are scattered across regions.
Moreover, in 1 the spread of the disease seems to have evolved di↵erently over time
in Catholic regions, i.e. where Catholics are the majority, versus non-Catholic ones.
In robustness checks, this is evident regardless how Catholic regions are defined. More
specifically, a NUTS-3 region is defined as a Catholic (vs. a non-Catholic one) if: (a)
Catholics are more than Protestants in that region; (b) Catholics are the majority in that
1

We choose to focus on West Germany only, as the East part historically exhibits systematic di↵erences and could bias our results (Becker et al. (2020)). Given the very low number of cases/deaths and
Catholics it would very likely bias the results in our favour.

region; (c) the share of Catholics in that region is higher than their national average; and
(d) the share of Catholics in that region is higher than their share in the respective
NUTS-1 area. The spread of the virus at the onset of the pandemic is higher in NUTS-3
regions dominated by Catholics, and this led to higher levels of reported COVID-19 cases
per 100,000 population in those areas, as well as a higher number of resulting deaths.
[Figure 1 here]
To clearly identify this cultural aspect we look as to whether there were any di↵erences between past overall mortality in Catholic and non-Catholic regions similar to a
di↵erence-in-di↵erence pre-trends design (Appendix Figure A.2). Time series begin in
2011, considerably after the last major swine flu outbreak in 2009. To our knowledge,
no other major threat to public health that can be transmitted via social contacts occurred since then. Both lines are quite close and move in parallel implying that until the
COVID-19 pandemic nothing noticeable caused Catholics to pass at a higher rate, relative to non-Catholics. Any systematic di↵erences in genetic predisposition, socioeconomic
characteristics or behaviours such as risky attitudes would likely reflect in di↵erences in
mortality rates between groups in the past. Therefore, we are confident that it is cultural
aspects on the disease transmission that we are looking at. Several other demographic
and economic characteristics are also balanced between Catholic and non-Catholic regions
before the pandemic as can be seen in Table A.1 in the Appendix.2
A threat to identification could be that two of the most prominent Catholic states
(Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg) are in closer geographical proximity to Northern Italy,
which was reportedly the first European area hit the hardest by the pandemic. Even
though large airports are the primary entryways into the country, we consider land travel
as well as some recent working papers suggest (Pluemper and Neumayer (2020)). To that
end, we use Google Maps data, to also check whether driving distance from Milan, Italy,
a↵ects our baseline estimates. To further argue about the cultural transmission rather
than geographic proximity, we additionally focus on North Rhine-Westphalia, a state
further away from Germany’s southern border and one in which large shares of Catholics
and non-Catholics reside. Some early new articles as well as working papers (Pluemper
and Neumayer (2020)) suggest that the higher spread in this state is likely to be because
of numerous carnival festivities in February. To address this concern, we look at Apple
daily mobility data.
2

For example, defining Catholic regions as those where Catholics are the majority, there are no
notable di↵erences in characteristics like share of foreigners, mean age, hospital beds per person, GDP
per capita, and share of people over 65 years old. Protestant areas have higher unemployment, more
people completed secondary education and they are more densely populated.

These data are obtained through GPS tracking and they are available at the city level
(after 13 January 2020, and relative to that date). They provide information regarding
requests for directions by transport type, i.e. walking, driving and transit. We classified
the cities available for (West) Germany into Catholic- and non-Catholic dominated ones
and we calculated the mean mobility indicators for each group of cities (weighted by
the local population). Trends by transportation type before and after the lock-down
(22 March, 2020) are in Figure 1. There is a spike in using public transport about 30
days before the lockdown, which coincides with the culmination of carnival festivities
in late February. However, this spike is visible not only in Catholic, but also in nonCatholic cities during that period, and the two lines (just as the spread per capita) are
indistinguishable from each other. Moreover, even though carnival started as a Catholic
tradition, it has evolved into a nation-wide celebration for the youth, so that transmission
of an infectious disease is just as likely anywhere in the country.
A natural starting point for the analysis is to demonstrate that the reported COVID19 incidence does vary with religion at the regional level. This is challenging because
demographic information at a geographically disaggregated level do not arrive at the
same frequency as data on infectious diseases do. Nevertheless, we model the number of
COVID-19 cases as follows:
Yrd = ↵Yrd ⌧ Srd

⌧

+ Catholicr + Xr + tr +

R

+ ✏rd

(1)

where Y is the number of reported COVID-19 cases in NUTS3 region r 2 {1, . . . , N } in
day d of the outbreak, Catholic is the logged share of Catholics in region r (based on
recent data before the virus outbreak), tr is a linear time trend starting from the day
when the first case was reported in each region, R is a set of regional fixed e↵ects (at
a more aggregated level so they are not perfectly collinear with the demographic and
economic predictors) and ✏rd is the error term.
The variable S represents the proportion of susceptible individuals in the regional
population, where their stock in each region has been approximated as the number of
people after removing those reported deceased from the virus in each day (Adda (2016)).
The ⌧ parameter represents the incubation period and has been set equal to 14 days,
although we results are robust to a wide range of alternative lags (i.e. 3 to 20 days).
(Lauer et al. (2020)). We do not consider any spatial variation in the model so the incidence rate in each region is solely determined by its own past realisations, i.e. parameter
↵ should be interpreted as an estimate of the within-region spread. All models control
for the size of the local population and for a series for economic and demographic controls, as well as for travelling distance from Milan. Estimating these empirical models
will provide an indication of whether the spread of the COVID-19 disease varies with the
6

share of Catholics in the region, conditional on other characteristics, area fixed e↵ects
and regional time trends.
A problem with this specification is that regional (at the NUTS-3 level) time-invariant
unobserved heterogeneity is not adequately partialled out; although results are conditional to broader-level regional fixed e↵ects. To address this issue, we apply the two-step
method suggested by Pesaran and Zhou (2018) in order to uncover time-invariant e↵ects
in a case where N is large T is small and fixed. More specifically, the predicted residuals
from a fixed-e↵ect estimation are averaged for each NUTS-3 region over the entire period.
In the second step, they are used as the dependent variable in an OLS regression over the
cross-sectional sample of NUTS-3 regions, where models control for the share of Catholics
and other local characteristics (e.g. travelling distance from Milan and socio-economic
variables). The results are robust even after taking out the regional fixed e↵ect, indicating a positive relationship between the virus spread and the prevalence of Catholics in
the region.
Our main hypothesis is whether the di↵erence mortality in Catholic versus nonCatholic regions is higher after the onset of the pandemic. Having established that the
pre-pandemic mortality trends were similar in both regions (Figure A.2 in the Appendix),
we empirically test for this by adopting the following di↵erence-in-di↵erences framework:
mrt =

0

+

1 Catholicr

+

2 Onsett

+

3 Catholicr

⇥ Onsett + urt

(2)

where mrt is the mortality rate in the r-th region in day t, Catholic is an indicator of
a predominantly Catholic region and Onset is a dummy variable switched on after the
first COVID-19 related death in the region was reported. The coefficient of interest in
Equation 2 is 3 and indicates whether di↵erences in mortality rates between Catholic
and non-Catholic regions have changed after the onset of the pandemic and as a result
of it. Based on our hypothesis about greater transmission of the disease in regions where
social ties are stronger, we should expect that 3 > 0.

3.2

Data

We combine several data sources. Data on COVID-19 cases come from the Robert Koch
Institute (RKI) which is a German federal government research institute responsible for
disease control and prevention. It has been publishing validated data on reported COVID19 cases and related deaths since January 28, 2020. These are daily data by gender, age
group and administrative district (412 Landkreise in total). In this analysis, we focus
only on the 324 West Germany districts, because including East Germany could bias the
results (Becker et al. (2020)). In order to be matched to a series of regional characteristics,
7

these COVID-19 series were collapsed by NUTS-3 region and date (running from January
28 to May 01), resulting in a balanced panel of more than 32,000 observations.
Our main controls are taken from the Federal Statistical Office (Statistisches Bundesamt of Germany and are validated until 2017. These include a number of demographic
and socioeconomic characteristics at the regional level, e.g. population and population
density, share of people over 65 years old, share of foreigners, share of males and females,
share of those who completed secondary education, GDP, number of hospital beds, number of nights spend per person as an indicator for tourism-related activity, and number of
vehicles per capita (motorisation rate) as a proxy for travelling and commuting intensity
in each region. Moreover, we use Google Maps data in order to calculate the fastest driving distance between Milan, Italy and the major city of each NUTS-3 region. We also
use the 2011 German Census in order to calculate the number of Catholics, Evangelicals
and other/no denominations in each region. The share of Catholics relative to the total
population in the area will be our main variable of interest.
The individual level data stem from the European Social Survey (ESS) 2018 and the
European Values Survey (EVS) 2018, two representative data sets of 1,881 and 4,259
adults in West Germany respectively, covering a range of questions around values and
social norms. The variables of interest proxy for close family and social ties, i.e. the
frequency of social interactions, the perceived frequency compared to individual of the
same age, the number of people one is comfortable confiding in, the importance of family,
the importance of friends, the level of trust towards family members and whether the
respondents reside with their parents or parents-in-law. Further, we use individual and
household characteristics as controls. These include the age of the respondent, gender,
employment status, education level, subjective health status, age of the youngest household member (EVS only), household size, household income, size of the city/town (EVS
only) and NUTS-1 fixed e↵ects. Finally, to check for di↵erences in mobility, we use Apple
daily data on mobility volume (by means of transportation) at the city level.

Results
Baseline results

Table 1 displays the results from Equation 1 using the daily number of new reported
COVID-19 cases per NUTS-3 region as outcome. To address any issues regarding proximity to the Northern Italian border, we used Google Maps to calculate the fastest driving
distances from Milan, Italy to the major city of each one of the West German NUTS-3
regions. Although this does not completely rule out any geographic heterogeneity, it
mitigates any concerns with respect to geographic dispersion of the pandemic in Europe.

In Column 1 we use our full set of controls including travel distance to Milan and state
fixed e↵ects and we observe a positive and statistically significant relationship between
the local share of Catholics and COVID-19 incidence. The 14-day lagged COVID-19
incidence is as expected a strong predictor of today’s count.3
[Table 1 here]
The same conclusions hold when the cumulative number of reported COVID-19 cases
is considered as the outcome, in Appendix Table A.2. Again, the lagged number of
cumulative incidence at the regional level is a strong determinant of the current spread,
although to a lesser extent. Hence, the results in Column 4 of 1 should be expected, i.e.
a positive relationship between the local share of Catholics and the number of deaths, as
well as the cumulative number of deaths (Table A.2 Column 4).4
The three states with most cases and deaths as of April 2020 are Bayern, BadenWürttemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia. The former two are predominantly catholic,
56% and 38% Catholics, respectively, whereas North Rhine-Westphalia is split in the
middle. However, the two southern states of Bayern and Baden-Württemberg border
on Austria and are geographically closer to Northern Italy, the alleged epicenter of the
pandemic in Europe. As this geographical proximity might a↵ect our results, we focus
part of the analysis on North Rhine-Westphalia where the share of Catholics is high at
42%, but a substantial share of Evangelicals (28%) also live there. When the estimation
sample is restricted to that state, in Column 3 of Table 1, a positive relationship still
emerges after controlling for time e↵ects and local demographics. This is also the case
when the outcome is the number of deaths, in Column 6 of Table 1. With respect to
the cumulative number of cases in Column 3 of A.2, the relationship is not statistically
significant, but remains positive and in line with what reported when conditioning on
all West Germany regions. However, it is again positive and highly significant when
considering the cumulative number of deaths in Column 6.
All these results are conditional to greater region fixed e↵ects, because controlling
for NUTS-3 fixed e↵ects in the baseline models would not allow to obtain estimates for
the local Catholics share. However, this could produce biased coefficients, i.e. in the
case where the share of Catholics (and the spread of the virus) are correlated with timeinvariant unobserved heterogeneity at the regional level. This is a common problem in
3

The 14-day lagged number of incidence has been multiplied by a factor that represents the fraction of
susceptible individuals in the local (NUTS-3) population. This factor is an approximation, and the local
population is calculated as the population minus the cumulative number of COVID-19-related deaths in
each day. As such, it does not consider population changes due to local-specific fertility and mortality
from other causes, and does not address any endogeneity concerns. Nevertheless, results are robust to
the inclusion of various lags, ranging from 3 to 20 days.

In all cases the results are robust to the inclusion of day-of-week fixed e↵ects to account for constant
di↵erences in working and leisure patterns across localities.

the emerging COVID-19 empirical literature because regional economic and demographic
covariates are not available at the daily level and during the (recent) period under study.
Therefore, as an attempt to address this issue, we use the fixed-e↵ects filtered (FEF)
estimator suggested by Pesaran and Zhou (2018) in order to uncover the e↵ect of a
time-invariant covariates when using a panel dataset where N is large and T is small.
More specifically, in the first step the (logged) number of COVID-19 cases (and deaths)
was regressed on a set of NUTS-3 fixed e↵ects, past COVID-19 incidence, day of week
fixed e↵ects and a regional linear time trend (fixed e↵ect estimation). Then, the residual
COVID-19 incidence (and related deaths) was obtained and averaged over the period for
each region. In the second step, we regressed this mean residual on the local Catholics
share and other local characteristics using the cross-sectional sample of NUTS-3 regions.
The results, in panel A of Table 2, confirm a positive and significant relationship. Moreover, the estimated coefficients remain positive and significant even after controlling for
demographic and economic characteristics and driving distance from Milan. The picture
remains largely the same when repeating the same exercise for the number of deaths.
[Table 2 here]
Moreover, we estimate whether the spread of the virus was higher in two phases of
the pandemic in Germany, i.e. before and after the general lockdown implemented on
March 22, 2020. The results are in Table 2, panel B. In this case, we estimated the
first step residuals using data only until the implementation of the lockdown. The e↵ect
of Catholics share remains positive and significant on regional characteristics. Then we
use the COVID-19 data to estimate residual virus incidence in each region during the
lockdown period. The local share of Catholics remains a positive and significant predictor
even after controlling for local characteristics and the (log) stock of cumulative cases per
100,000 local population at the date of lockdown implementation. This suggests that after
mobility was restricted and filtering out the already existing number of cases, transmission
was still higher among Catholics.
We then proceed with a di↵erence-in-di↵erences estimation using the total number
of deaths from all causes across regions. A limitation is that only NUTS-1 level counts
are provided by the Federal Statistical Office. The time series span from 1 January until
17 May. NUTS-1 West Germany regions are split into predominantly Catholic vs. nonCatholic. To capture the “after” dimension we consider the number of deaths after the
first reported death in each region. The results are in column 1, Table 3. We then proceed
to limit the time span until 22 April which is when some restrictions were lifted and it is
roughly a month in since the country entered the lockdown. This would allow to capture

10

fatalities resulting from the initial stage of the pandemic5 . In Column 3 we add a time
trend (days since first reported death) to potentially capture the already higher spread
in some regions compared to others. Further, we add NUTS-1 fixed e↵ects in Column 4.
Finally, we change the time variable to “first reported case” in Column 5 to capture the
already existing high cases counts before the first fatalities were reported. In all of our
estimation the di↵erence-in-di↵erence estimator is positive and highly significant ensuring
that both the spread and fatalities were higher in predominantly Catholic regions.
3.3.2

Mechanisms

Having established a positive link between COVID-19 incidence and Catholics share at the
local level, a possible mechanism could operate through social norms, i.e. tighter social
networks and stronger family ties. Our aim is not to discuss religion or Catholicism in
Europe in itself, but rather to explore whether cultural di↵erences within a very similar
population could have impacted groups di↵erently.
Historically, it seems that Protestants and non-Catholics have developed more market
oriented and individualistic behaviours (Becker and Pascali (2019)), whereas catholic regions were characterized by rent-seeking behaviours through established social structures
(Ekelund et al. (2002)). Moreover, Arruñada (2009) argues that these di↵erences are
mostly prominent in social dimensions and ethics and that social interaction is regarded
by Protestants only as an enforcement and control mechanism. This implies that social
interaction as an intrinsic behaviour is more likely to be found among Catholics. For
these reasons we believe that Catholics in Germany exhibit stronger social and family
ties.
To look deeper into potential mechanisms, we turn to the European Social Survey
2018 (Wave 9) for Germany. The survey contains questions on an individual level on the
frequency of social interactions, on the perceived frequency of such interaction compared
to ones peers and also a question on the number of individuals with whom one feels
comfortable discussing private and individual matters. We code the first two questions
as dummies indicating the frequency of social interactions as more than ”several times a
week” and the perceived relative measure as ”at least the same”. The third variable of
interest is the number of individuals respondents confide in. Further, we control for age,
gender, subjective health status, employment status, household size, household income
and NUTS-1 fixed e↵ects. We also code a dummy for identifying as belonging to the
Catholic denomination. The results in Section A of 4 suggest that there is a positive
relationship between belonging to the Catholic denomination and our measures for social
5

The results are robust to limiting the time-frame until 31 March which would still capture infections
prior to the lockdown

11

interactions. The coefficient for frequency is barely not significant at the 10% level (tstat=1.67), but the other two are, indicating that Catholics tend to have more frequent
social interactions and exhibit stronger ties.
The 2018 European Values Survey provides another set of questions that could serve
as proxies for these attitudes and behaviours. Here we employ a set of regressions using
individual-level data on the importance of family and friends in an individual’s life, the
level of trust towards members of the family and the likelihood to reside with parents
(or parents-in-law) in the same household. Our variable of interest is simply a dummy
on whether the individual belongs to the Catholic denomination. Controlling for the
same set of socioeconomic characteristics and regional fixed e↵ects as in Section A 6 , the
results in Section B of Table 4 indicate that Catholics, relative to non-Catholics, regard
their family and friends as very important, exhibit higher trust towards family members
and have a higher probability of residing in the same household with their parents or
parents-in-law. This is in line with Arruñada (2009) and suggests that Catholics exhibit
much stronger social and family ties, which in turn could be a mechanism through which
a higher spread and incidence of COVID-19 among Catholics operates.
To further strengthen our proposed mechanism, we employ another set of regressions
with the individual-level data. The idea is to determine whether cultural di↵erences
could a↵ect the di↵erential outcomes of the outbreak in other ways rather than through
social contacts. Specifically, we test whether Catholics have a higher propensity to justify cheating behaviour in avoiding taxes, accepting bribes and avoiding fares in public
transport. Further, we examine their confidence in the government, even though recent
research suggest that in most European countries confidence in the governments and the
implemented measures have increased (Bol et al. (2020)) and that during the recent pandemic individuals tend to prioritize health (Hargreaves Heap et al. (2020)). This should
indicate whether the higher spread among Catholics could be a result of overall riskier behaviour or groups disregarding the rules and the protective measures put into place. This
would likely have a di↵erential impact on the spread and mortality of the disease after
the measures came into place. We empirically test this hypothesis using individual-level
German data from the European Values Survey.
Broadly speaking, the data reveal that generally adherence to rules is very high in
Germany. Moreover, the regression results in Section C of Table 4 do not show a higher
propensity for Catholics to disobey rules using the same set of individual controls as in
Section A and regional fixed e↵ects. If anything, Catholics are less likely to tolerate
even the milder o↵ense (avoiding fare) and exhibit marginally higher confidence in the
6

Additionally we control for the age of the youngest household member and the size of the city, which
are only provided in the EVS

12

government. For this reason we believe that the increased spread is unlikely to be a result
of risky behaviour and disregard for rules or the government’s measures and more related
to social and family networks.
To further rule out other behavioural di↵erences between Catholics and non-Catholics,
we look again at the Apple mobility data in Figure ??. There is a significant drop in
mobility after the lockdown. However, there is no significant di↵erentiation on the basis
of religion. We are therefore confident that the higher transmission rates among Catholics
are likely to be a results of close social circles and strong family ties and not of higher
mobility after the lockdown.

Discussion

Culture shapes social norms and, to a large extent, dictates societal and individual behaviour. Cultural di↵erences are frequently unobserved. Nevertheless, it is of very high
importance to take them under consideration as they can lead to di↵erent outcomes.
Such heterogeneities need to be taken into account not only in epidemiological modelling
and parametrization, but also to design optimal policy responses. These heterogeneities
do not only exist between, but also within countries and often go beyond standard socioeconomic characteristics.
This is all the more important when facing crises such as the current COVID-19
pandemic. Being able to explain the wildly di↵erent trajectories of countries could provide invaluable insight to policymakers to better target mitigation measures and policies
around pandemics (Platteau and Verardi (2020)). Previous attempts to highlight the
importance of culture and how it can determine social interactions are marred by unobserved heterogeneity (Bayer and Kuhn (2020)) and it is difficult to disentangle the
number of factors that need to be taken into account. Di↵erences in the timing of the
pandemic, health care systems, testing methods to accumulate data and the timing and
the nature of policy response, render cross country comparisons rather difficult.
In this paper we used data on daily cases and deaths attributed to COVID-19 in
West Germany to overcome some of these issues and to identify the impact of cultural
di↵erences on the spread of the disease and the resulting death toll. Our results suggest
that Catholics that inherently exhibit stronger social and family networks were more
severely a↵ected. This could explain why in societies with stronger social- and family
ties such as Italy and Spain the spread was rapid from the onset and ultimately lead to
a high death toll in the initial phase of the outbreak.

Note: OLS regressions using robust standard errors clustered at NUTS-1 level. The data in
Section A are from the European Social Survey 2018 for Germany. The independent variable
in the first Column is dummy coded one if the individual meets with others more than ”several times a week”. In the second Column the dummy takes the value one if the individual
perceives themselves to meet more than ”about the same” compared to their peers. In the final Column respondents indicate the number of people with whom they ”can discuss intimate
and private matters”. The data In Sections B and C are from the European Values Survey
2018 for Germany. The independent variables in Section B are on a 1-4 scale on the importance of family and friends in ones life and the level of trust towards members of the family,
as well as a binary variable on whether one resides with their parents or parents-in-law. The
independent variables in Section C are on a 1-10 scale whether it is justified to avoid taxes,
to accept a bribe and to avoid fare in public transport, as well as a 4-point scale indicating
confidence in the government. We control for perceived health status, gender, age, household
income, education level, employment status, age of the youngest household member and size
of the city, as well as state fixed e↵ects.
