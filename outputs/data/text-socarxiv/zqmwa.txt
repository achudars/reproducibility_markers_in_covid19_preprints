"3" "Abstract"
"4" "Geographic Information Science ( GIS ) had established itself as a distinct domain and incredibly useful whenever the research is related to geography, space, and  other  spatio -temporal  dimensions .  However ,  the scientific landscape on the  integration of  GIS  in the COVID related studies   is largely unknow n .  In this systematic review ,   we assessed the current evidence on  the implementation of  GIS  and other geospatial tools and technologies in COVID-19  pandemic. We  systematically retrieved and  reviewed 7 9  research articles that either directly used  GIS  or other Geospatial tools as part of their analysis.  We grouped the identified papers under six broader thematic groups based on the objectives and research questions of the study- environmental,  socio-economic,  and cultural, public health, spatial transmission, computer- aided modeling , and  data mining .  The interdisciplinary nature of  how geographic and spatial analysis was used in COVID-19  research  was noticeable among the reviewed papers. Although  GIS  has substantial potential in planning to slow down the spread,  surveillance,  contact tracing ,  and identify the trends and hotspots of breakdowns, it was not employed as much as it could have been .   This review not only provided an overarching view on how  GIS  has been used in COVID-19 research  so far  but also concluded that this geospatial analysis and  technologies c ould  be used in future public health emergencies along with statistical and other socio - economic modeling techniques. Our systematic review also provides how  both scientific communities and  policymakers  could leverage  GIS  to extract useful information to  make  an  informed decision in the  coming days ."

"6" "Introduction"
"7" "COVID -19 has taken the world within a  blink  of an eye  with a rapidly increasing confirmed cases and  case-fatalities around the world  [ 1 ] . After the origination in the Hubei province of China in late December to early January, WHO called it an epidemic on January 29   [ 2 ] , named it COVID-19 on February 11,  and  declared  it as a pandemic on March 11 [ 3 ] .  Although the first report case was in China ,  and it was the epicenter of the pandemic, the virus has mutated and changed the transmission pattern several times since then. Lately, the United States, parts of Europe ,  and countries in the Global South had been reporting the highest number of cases with  a  rapid increase in both confirmed cases and fatalities   [ 1 ] ."
"8" "The declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic and subsequent lockdown at various levels- from the local city level to the country level, has a much broader impact on our surrounding environment  compared to  what we usually observe.  Despite the data availability,  studies examining the impacts of this  ongoing  pandemic and  enforced  lockdowns using different geospatial analysis techniques is  not substantial.   However,  the application of spatial analysis tools, techniques, and  Geographic Information System ( G IS )  platforms provide the  scientific  community and the practitioners  a wide range of benefits. These benefits include more straightforward and understandable visu aliz ation, real-time tracking of confirmed and reported case numbers   [ 4 ] , contact tracing, spread direction, and also, to identify the hotspots to limit the dispersion and community spread   [ 5 ,  6 ] .  The application of  GIS  in public-health related issues is not something introduced during this pandemic. It was  used  by numerous studies in the past, long before the computerized  GIS  software was born in the mid-1960s   [ 7 ] . Since the n ,  GIS  was extensively used in analyzing, visualizing, and detecting patterns of disease.  A recent review found that among the included 869 studies,  one-fourth of the studies  used  GIS  techniques  for mapping, especially infectious disease mapping  [ 8 ] ."
"9" "Different  GIS  software and methods were implemented and widely accepted to  prevent the transmission by  impos ing  lockdowns and contact tracing. The best example of  GIS   application  during this pandemic  is  the web-based near-real-time COVID dashboard created by the Johns Hopkins University   [ 4 ,  9 ,  10 ] . Later the WHO and  different   local and regional governing bodies  also followed the same direction   [ 11 ] .  The online dashboards have been a critical source of information during this pandemic.  Although at the beginning the studies implementing or using  GIS  methods were more focused on visualizing or contact tracing, later, they moved on spatial analysis incorporating social, economic, environmental, and more sophisticated analytical tools as more data started to become available."
"10" "There have been attempts to review  the  studies regarding the  application  of geospatial analysis  in COVID-19 related studies . Pardo et al. (2020)  review ed  the studies that were focused on understanding the distribution patterns of the pandemic  and identified such applications in  six thematic groups  [ 12 ] . Similar attempts were made by Kamel Boulous and Geraghty (2020) to review the web-based use of  GIS  technologies   [ 6 ] . However, none of these approaches followed a systematic approach in selecting the articles, and the reviews were mostly incomprehensive.  Systematic reviews provide an organized, replicable, and methodologically synthesized landscape of evidence that may inform policymaking and practice. During this pandemic, the scarcity of evidence remains a major challenge for public policymaking, which necessitates a careful assessment of the growing body of literature on  GIS  and geospatial analyses. Also, systematically evaluated evidence is critical for the advancement of science as further primary studies or research syntheses can be informed by the findings of a systematic review. We acknowledged this knowledge gap and conceptualized this review to advance science and practice related to G IS  and a wide range of geospatial techniques that are being used in this pandemic . The  objective  of this study is to conduct a systematic review of the implementation of  GIS  and other geospatial tools and technologies in COVID -19  related  studies . We highlighted the works that used geospatial techniques as part of their analytical method and tried to provide pointers on how these techniques can be better used in times of future public health emergencies."
"11" "Methodology"
"12" "2.1 .  Guideline and data sources"
"13" "This systematic review was conducted using the reporting guidelines as stated in the  P referred  R eporting  I tems for  S ystematic  R eviews and  M eta- A nalyses  (PRISMA) statement.  The PRISMA diagram for this review is shown in figure 1.  The data for this systematic review were retrieved from MEDLINE and Web of Science. Both databases have their own competitive advantages that provide a broader coverage of scholarly articles. MEDLINE is considered as the largest bibliographic databases for health sciences, whereas Web of Science provides access to  journals from multiple scholarly disciplines.  We used the following steps to identify relevant literature for this review. First, we used the following search query in each database: ( “COVID-19” OR “2019-nCoV” OR “2019 coronavirus” OR “2019 novel coronavirus” OR “novel coronavirus” OR “SARS-CoV-2” ) to identify COVID-19 related studies. Further, we used another search query to retrieve GIS-related studies as following: ( “ GIS ”   OR   “ArcGIS”   OR  \" G eographic information systems\"  OR  \" G eographic mapping\"  OR  \" S patial analysis\" OR \" G eospatial analysis\" ). At the next step, we combined both these queries with “AND” operator to identify literature that is likely to contain studies referring to both these topics. Furthermore,   a s COVID-19 related literature is evolving rapidly, we also searched the Google Scholar database to identify studies that may align with the objective of this review.  Also, we performed a reference searching and contacted subject matter experts for additional studies beyond the scope of the databases, if there were any.   We limited the  timeline for  literature  searching between 2019 and 2020 considering the origin of the outbreak in the late 2019. The search  was first conducted  on   May 7 , 2020 and updated on June 28, 2020."
"14" "2.2 .  Eligibility criteria"
"15" "Articles were considered eligible for this review if they were a) published in English language, b) available as peer-reviewed journal articles, c) the primary focus of the paper was on any aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic, d) demonstrated the applications of  GIS  or geospatial analyses. Any article that did not comply any of these criteria were excluded from this review. For example, non-English studies, articles that were not peer-reviewed (e.g., letters, editorials, comments), studies that did not focus on COVID-19, or did not use  GIS  or geospatial techniques (conceptual papers without providing any findings) were considered ineligible for inclusion."
"16" "2.3 .  Selection of studies and synthesis of evidence"
"17" "All citations retrieved through database searching were imported in Endnote reference manager software for curating the collective bibliography. Further, this library was exported to Rayyan QCRI, a cloud-based software for citations screening and assessment. Two authors independently assessed each citation against the eligibility criteria stated above. At the end of the process, a third reviewer was consulted to review the conflicts and a consensus on inclusion or exclusion was made upon discussion. The full texts of the primarily selected articles were reviewed and reviewed by all authors. Further, articles fulfilling all criteria for this review were retained and data were extracted using a predesigned extraction sheet in Microsoft Excel on the following variables: a) publication details, b) study objectives, c) the sources of data, d) countries of origin, e) COVID-19 specific domain presented in the papers, f) the use of  GIS  or geospatial analyses, and g) the research outcomes or key findings of those studies.  The  applications of  GIS  or geospatial analyses on  COVID-19 studies were identified and narratively synthesized as major themes alongside tabulation of the key findings. A quality appraisal was not considered in this review due to a large volume of studies and profound heterogeneity in methodological approaches, data sources, measurements, types of applications adopted in different contexts, and research outcomes in respective studies."

"19" "Results"
"20" "3.1. Summary and characteristics of reviewed articles"
"21" "We found a total of 79 articles which met all the inclusion criteria. A summary of these 79 reviewed articles are listed in table 1.  The articles included in the review were published in a diverse group of journals, mostly in public health, urban planning, geography, and interdisciplinary journals. Although COVID-19 is more of a public health and welfare issue, these articles covered from public health issues to planning techniques, environmental concerns ,  and ,  most importantly, used geospatial analysis tools and techniques as part of their methods.   About  32.9  percent of the articles (n= 26 ) used China and   21.5  percent  the United States  ( n=17 )  as their study site,  which  indicates to the  disparity  of the geographic coverage. Figure  2  shows the geographic distribution of the study area used in the 79 articles we included in our review.  Wuhan, China, first reported  COVID -19 cases ,  and  the  GIS  has the highest number of confirmed cases,  which  also was reflected in the over-representation of these two countries in the se  articles.  Africa  and Europe  had the lowest number of articles (n= 4 ).  Among  these reviewed articles,  15  percent (n= 12 ) worked on a global or multi-national scale. The global studies are more focused on mobility and how COVID -19  transmitted via airports and other  human mobility   [ 13-15 ] ."
"22" "A  wide   range  of  geospatial tools were used in the reviewed articles. Most of these articles used  regression analysis (n=18)  and   correlation analysis ( n= 11)   for statistical analysis .  M ost prominently used spatial analysis was  hotspot analysis using either kernel density function or other density techniques ( n= 16)  followed by  the spatial autocorrelation  analysis  using either global or local Moran’s I ndex  ( n= 13 )  and  proximity analysis ( n= 5) .  A ll  the articles used different visualization techniques to display either the intermediate or the end products. Along with th at, suitability analysis  ( n= 3 ) and sensitivity analysis ( n= 4 )  was also  used to find either  access to hospitals or how the cases are distributed. One of the lesser  implemented but  interesting  technique was to track down the transmission pattern using the mobility data   [ 16-18 ] .  Similarly, remote sensing data was used for air  quality and pollution measurement, but not that prominently ( n= 6 ).  Nighttime  imagery and solar radiation data  were  used by ( n= 5 ) a few works to compare the energy consumption differences between before and after pandemic situation."
"23" "Figure  2  (a) article count per country and geographic distribution of the study sites; (b)  number of articles in each continents  based on study site  along with   Global scale studies; (c) number of articles in each thematic groups used in this review; and (d)  bubble chart showing the frequency of each software or tool used for spatial analysis"
"24" "ESRI  ArcGIS is the most used platform ( n= 36 )  in these articles , but other open-source platforms like RStudio where spatial and statistical analysis can be done  simultaneously , were used highly as well ( n= 6 ). Besides RStudio, QGIS  ( n= 4)  is another open source software platform that was highly employed by the researchers.  Apart from that, a couple of the studies developed their own platforms and one of the studies used G PS.  data.  Most of these articles used  COVID - 19 confirmed cases as part of their analysis ( n= 77 ). In most cases, researchers used either WHO provided data or J HU  provided data for the research purpose.  As  several  spatial analysis was performed based on remotely sensed data, NASA and USGS satellite images were the primary source for those ( n= 5 ). Apart from that A ir  Q uality  I ndex (AQI)  was used in the articles focused on environmental analysis   ( n= 8 )."
"25" "Thematic groups"
"26" "The rapid  diffusion   of COVID-19 and  data  convenience  had enforced the global scientific community to work more vigorously on geospatial analysis of this pandemic. These studies had focused on  distinct aspects  of the pandemic and have different inputs.  T he  articles  included in this  review  was divided into six thematic groups - environment (n= 25 ), socio - economic and cultural (n= 13 ),  Population Health Surveillance  (n= 8 ), spatial transmission (n= 9 ), computer-aided spatial and statistical analysis and modeling (n= 1 7 ) and big data, social media and mobile data (n= 10 ) ."
"27" "Environment"
"28" "We found a  total of  25  articles that emphasized on  the use of GIS and  spatial analysis  on environmental issues related to  COVID-19  [ 17, 19-42 ] .   Although these studies had a similar research  interest,  they differ  significantly based  on  the  spatial scale -  from global  [ 19-23 ]   to regional   [ 24 ,  25 ] , national   [ 26-34 ]  and small local scale studies   [ 35-41 ] .   S everal works examined the relationship between different meteorological factors and the  transmission  potential of the virus.   They included a diverse set of characteristics in the studies-  temperature   [ 17 ,  21-23 ,  26 ,  27 ,  29 ,  31-33 ,  35 ,  38 ,  40 ,  42 ] , humidity  [ 17 ,  22 ,  23 ,  27 ,  29 ,  31-33 ,  35 ,  40 ,  42 ] ,  precipitation  [ 17 ,  35 ] , daylight hours  [ 21 ,  42 ] , solar radiation  [ 17 ,  27 ,  31 ] , and wind-speed  [ 23 ,  29 ,  31 ,  35 ] .  One  primary  hypothesis of these studies w as  that these climatic factors and the dispersion of COVID-19  are  correlated .   In  an attempt to examine the hypothesis,  statistical and geospatial analysis  was used  as  a  key analytical  tool  [ 21 ,  27 ,  35 ,  40 ] ."
"29" "Studies analyzing  the  effects of temperature, humidity ,  and solar radiation  found that a relation  exists  between  the   transmission  of the virus  and humidity.  These studies  claim ed  that   humidity is directly associated with the  transmission  [ 27 ] , while temperature has no relation to the viruses diffusion  [ 31 ,  33 ] .   However, a n other  st udy  refuted  the se  findings and claimed  both temperature and average daylight hours  are influencing  the spread of the virus  [ 21 ] .  Other studies incorporated  demographic variables as well as mobility and infections data  with this  meteorological factors  to investigate  how  they  are correlated with the  COVID-19 outbreak  [ 31 ] .  Instead of  concentration mapping , t he y  show ed  the spatial distribution and sensitivity  of each factor  in the study area map   and  asserted  that  population  density  and human mobility among the provinces are directly influencing the  accelerated diffusion of COVID-19  cases ."
"30" "S tatistical  and spatial  analysis  and modeling   were  used in other studies  to identify the  association  between COVID-19 and climatic factors to understand the spatial  distribution  pattern of  C OVID -19 cases  [ 22 ,  40 ]   and  spatio -temporal prediction of  the   pandemic for  a  different  period  [ 32 ] .  These studies  concluded  that without  adequat e  and effective  control measures,  there is no evidence of humidity, and  summer weather substantially limit ing   the  pandemic growth   [ 22 ] .  Additionally,   Pearson ' s   correlation,  generalized additive model,  and  regression model s   were also utilized in  different studies  to understand the influence of climate on the virus transmission . These works widely used  GIS  for mapping the observed and predicted COVID cases   [ 26 ,  29 ] , mean temperature and humidity variation and correlation with  COVID  case s   [ 23 ] .  None of these studies  found  any  evidence  of slower  COVID-19  transmission with the change of temperature and humidity."
"31" "Different countries around the world  enforced   different lockdown strateg ies since mid-January , even before WHO declared  COVID-19  as a pandemic.  As a result of these lockdowns,  and  lowered  human and industrial activities,  a  substantial   decline  in air pollution  was noticed  [ 19 ,  20 ,  24 ,  25 ,  30 ,  36 ,  37 ,  39 ] .   Several s tudies  had   reported a significant reduction in NO 2 , CO ,  and SO 2  concentration in the environment   [ 19 ,  20 ,  24 ,  30 ,  36 ] .  Studies reported significant improvement in  AQI   [ 38 ]   and significant reductions in Particulate Matters (PM) concentrations  [ 40 ] .  Similar studies at a global scale reported  a  significant   decrease  in NO 2   c oncentration and   minor   decrease  in C O  concentration , and Aerosol Optical Depth   [ 19 ] ."
"32" "Other studies  identified a  global  reduction of environmental pollution  by  up to 30% ,  human  mobility  by  up to 90%   [ 20 ] , and  vessel activit ies  by up  to  69%  [ 25 ] .  A stud y  using satellite  images  to  compare  the pollutants  concentration  before, during, and after the  Chinese   S pring  F estival   observed  that the usual trend of  NO 2  an d  SO 2  concentrations  decrease before the festival and increase afterwards was not noticed in 2020   [ 30 ] .   ArcGIS was extensively used   in several studies   to quantify the association  between  AQI  and  the distribution of COVID -19  cases   [ 28 ,  29 ] .  These studies  claimed that air quality is a core driver of C OVID -19 dispersion around the world , and the dispersion enhances in a temperature ranged from 10 ° -20 °  C .   ArcGIS was also used  to perform sensitivity analysis, and for the calculation of Global Moran's I and LISA   to  analyz e  the impact of  PM concentration  in  the  air on  the  fatality rate  in China  [ 41 ] .  The study   concluded that   the fatality rate is  positive ly  correlat ed with the pollutant concentrations in the air."
"33" "Socio - e conomic and  c ultural"
"34" "In response to the coronavirus pandemic,  alongside the  booming clinical and public health research, social scientists are also retooling existing studies, methodologies ,  and data to understand the people ' s behavior responding to the pandemic and its impact on socio - economic and cultural settings around the globe.   A total of 1 2  articles were identified that emphasized on  socio-economic and cultural aspects  in COVID-19  and used GIS [ 42-53 ] .   Researchers  used G ross  D omestic  P roduct ( GDP ) , demographic and household compositions  data , population density, and  accessibility data   [ 42 ] .   Several researchers  utilized existing social vulnerability index data  and  applied  geospatial tools and techniques to examine the spatial pattern of COVID-19 emergence across different socio-cultural settings   [ 43-45 ] .   Studies  developed   dot density and choropleth maps of COVID-19 cases  and  reported  that  population density  diseases  along with   poverty and unemployment  rates  are the major indicators associated with  a  higher COVID-19 mortality rate   [ 45 ] ."
"35" "Different studies reported  association  among spatial distribution of  the  socioeconomic variables and the temporal progression of the pandemic  using  a regression model based  spatio -temporal analysis. They noticed that per capita  GIS  and public transit access is highly related to COVID-19 incidence  [ 42 ] .   Using a similar analytical tool, another study  estimated  the  association between virus infection and social vulnerability   consider ing  county-level socioeconomic data, demographic composition, disability and minority status, language, and housing and transportation database. The study concluded that the increase of COVID-19 cases are highly associated with minority status and language  [ 43 ] .   To understand the association between racial inequality and COVID-19 mortality, Kim and Bostwick (2020)  utilized  Principal  C omponent  A nalysis  (P C A )  and  H otspot  A nalysis  in ArcGIS . The study  reported  that  African American communities are the one  with highest  COVID-19 related  deaths  [ 44 ] .  Other studies also used ArcGIS and regression analysis  to investigate the spatial patterns of the COVID-19 in relation to socio-economic variables. This study used  GIS   to map the spatial aspects and disparities between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan communities and the regression analyses  to test the  hypotheses of positive correlations between COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates and socio-economic factors in  the  GIS   [ 46 ] ."
"36" "Proximity and hotspot analysis  in  GIS  has become a widely used geospatial analysis technique in the social research to understand the feasibility of social distancing   [ 47 ] , accessibility analysis of specific age group   [ 48 ,  49 ] . Gibson and Rush (2020) calculate d  the distance to  each  dwelling ' s nearest neighbors to identify  units  that are unable to  practice social distancing effectively .   Dryhurst et al.   (2020) developed a global  R isk  P erception  I ndex  (R .P.I. )  using  a  linear regression model and  used  GIS  to  plot   the  Mean   R isk  P erception of COVID-19 in ten countries  [ 50 ] .  Sarkar (2020)  used ArcGIS to reclassify  the  administrative units  of Bangladesh based on COVID-19 susceptibility  using  multicriteria analysis based pairwise comparison  [ 51 ] . Cavalcante and Abreu (2020) applied Moran’s I and LISA to identify the type and degree of spatial clustering and scatter plots of socio - economic indicators  [ 52 ] .  Similarly, Exploratory  Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) technique  was used  to identify spatial relationships between the density of built heritage resources and Airbnb listings.  Based on the calculation and mapping ,  they  concluded that the distribution of Airbnb listings has a certain degree of spatial autocorrelation   [ 53 ] ."
"37" "Population  h ealth   s urveillance"
"38" "From the first case in Wuhan to the global pandemic, an enormous number of public health studies  were  conducted to help the policymaker s  to understand how  best to  manage the current and future public health responses.  A total of  9  articles were identified that emphasized on  public health issues and used GIS [49,  54-6 1 ] .   Multiple studies developed a  multicriteria decision making  index  to  assess  the  risk and resilience of  the  existing healthcare system. Requia et al.  ( 2020 )  employed  GIS  techniques to  construct  a geodatabase  comprising  land use, income, population, health condition, number of hospital bed s,  and staff at the municipality scale . They  predicted  a deficit of  17  beds in Brazilian municipalities  [ 54 ] .  Similarly,  Jovanović et al.  ( 2020 )  developed a global index comprising of 57 indicators  using  ArcGIS - based network analysis for hospital accessibility and resilience  mapping   [ 54 ,  55 ] ."
"39" "GIS  was used to find out whether there is any association between  orthopedic surgeons age and COVID-19 confirmed cases  [ 56 ] .  The study reported a spatial relationship between the number of cases and number of surgeons in a state.   In a similar study,  Ruthberg et al. (2020) studied the potential risk of otolaryngologists above age 60 due to COVID-19, where they used a heat map to show the state-wise potential risk zone using QGIS. The study indicated that New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan were the riskiest zone according to the ratio of the number of confirmed cases to the number of total E NT 's over 60  [ 57 ] .   Kuupiel et al .  (2020) calculated the distance from the  primary healthcare ( P HC. )  clinic as well as to the nearest health facility in ArcGIS to measure geographical accessibility (in term s  of distance and time) to C OVID -19 specialized hospital facilities in Ghana.  The analysis  reported that the current mean travel time  (more than an hour)  and distance  (more than 35 kilometers)  to P HC  is significantly higher than the globally accepted standard s   [ 58 ] .  Similar accessibility analysis was done in Australia using Proximity analysis and hotspot analysis  to measure travel time to  the  closest hospital facility for aged population  resulted in a similar outcome as well  [ 49 ] ."
"40" "Ahmadi et al. (2020) developed an epidemic prediction model for spatial - temporal analysis to predict and estimate the number of patients and deaths  at  the end of pandemic (infected,  cured,  and dead cases).  T he study predicted that approximately 7900 and 4620 deaths w ould  occur in Iran from May 13 to June 1, 2020, respectively, and then the curve will flatten   [ 59 ] .   To analyze the epidemiology of COVID-19,  studies also utilized georeferencing. These studies first  geocoded all COVID-19 cases and  then joined  them to the county  laye rs  by administrative codes  in ArcGIS  and  afterwards,  applied LISA. This study  reported that  the spatial clustering is not random and shows significant spatial heterogeneity in China  [ 60 ] .   Wastewater Based Epidemiology (WBE) tool  was proposed  as a surveillance tool to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic   [ 61 ] .  T he study used  multiple  variables to run the GIS-based hydraulic model and network analysis using the SWMM modeling environment and ArcGIS. The result effectively served  as a justification  to use WBE as a rapid and efficient tool to track COVID-19 , which the authors claimed  could be used with clinical testing to save billions of  dollars   [ 61 ] ."
"41" "Spatial  pattern  analys is  of COVID-19"
"42" "A total of  9  articles were identified that emphasized on identifying the spatial transmission pattern analysis of  COVID-19 [ 14-15, 18, 61-66 ].   So far, only one study had used geospatial analysis to identify  Spatio -temporal clusters and prediction modeling for COVID-19 transmission. They utilized the Poisson probability distribution model, Kernel density analysis, and space-time scanning analysis to identify high-risk  Spatio -temporal clusters for transmission of COVID-19 in Brazil and detected active  Spatio -temporal clusters comprising six municipalities in the south-central region of Brazil   [ 62 ] .  only two studies so far studied how travel restrictions may have limited the epidemic trajectory. One of them developed a global model based on internationally reported cases and mobility data, to project the impact of travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic and revealed that Wuhan travel ban only hindered the overall epidemic trajectory by 3 to 5 days in other cities of China but had a significant influence on the international scale dispersion  [ 18 ] .  Studies also  estimated the probability of  COVID-19  cases  transportation before January 23 among 369 cities in China  and   reported that  130 cities in China have  more than  50% chance of having a COVID -19  case imported from Wuhan   [ 63 ] ."
"43" "In a global study  to identify geographic risks of COVID-19 transmission using online Rasch Modeling Algorithm, the authors   reported  that Iran, South Korea, Italy, Germany, Spain, China (Hubei), and France, are the top countries with  higher  outbreak potential respectively   [ 64 ] .  Other studies utilized accessibility analysis techniques  to assess the spatial diffusion of COVID-19,  using  GIS - based origin, destinations ,  and frequencies mapping of public transportation from Wuhan .  The study claimed tha t increase of COVID-19 cases have a direct relationship with  the frequency of public transport from Wuhan  [ 65 ] .   Other studies utilized  time-series analysis and  plot s   to portray the  spatial and temporal variation of COVID-19 cases in China  and  to elucidate the role of case importation in transmission in cities across China  using  spatial analysis   [ 66 ] ."
"44" "One other global study used  GIS  to visualize the   worldwide distribution of air transport passengers from Wuhan  and  infected traveler’s ratio around the world   [ 15 ] .  Geo-referencing of confirmed cases also played an interesting role in the spatial pattern analysis studies. These studies measured  and identified the  regions that have a high risk of transmission at an early stage  [ 67 ] .  Similarly,   Generalized Linear Regression (G .L.M. ) model  was used  to analyze the spread and control of COVID-19  cases  using case reports,  and  human movement  data . This study  utilized   spatial distribution  mapping of the travel movements from Wuhan to each province and  modeled  the spatial dispersal pattern of COVID-19 trajectories with or without Wuhan travel ban . They  found that Wuhan shutdown delayed arrival of COVID-19 in other cities by  around 3  days  [ 14 ] ."
"45" "Computer-aided  spatial and statistical  analysis and modeling"
"46" "A substantial number of studies were found to apply computer-aided spatial  and  statistical analysis and modeling techniques in analyzing  distinct aspects  of COVID-19.  A total of 1 6  articles were identified that emphasized on computer-aided spatial and statistical analysis and modeling in COVID-19  [ 6 8 -83 ] .   Most of these  works were focused on analyzing the spatial distribution pattern of COVID-19 cases using the confirmed cases data  [ 68-74 ] , or  news reports of COVID-19 cases as proxy data  [ 75 ] .   Most of the studies were focused on examining the spatial distribution and relationship between COVID-19 cases,  deaths,  and  locations.   Adekunle et al. (2020) examined the  same   relationship . The y  found a positive  statistically significant relationship among   spatial clusters,  confirmed cases and potential deaths   [ 68 ] .  Another similar study in Hubei, China ,   demonstrated that the High-Low cluster had no high-value incidence cluster where Local Moran's I indicated that Hubei was the only province with High-Low aggregation  [ 70 ] .   Moran's I  was applied in analyzing the spatial and temporal distribution of cases in Hubei province by other studies as well  [ 73 ] ."
"47" "Multiple studies examined the spatial and temporal distrib ution and modeled the trend of COVID-19 cases growth in ArcGIS and  found  that the highest risk place was those  that  had  a  high population inflow from Wuhan and Hubei province   [ 71 ,  72 ] .  Spatial modeling  using  Poisson space-time scan statistics   to  produce cluster mapping attempts also led to   the  proposal of  first  rapid surveillance of the entire  GIS  to monitor the spread of COVID-19   [ 69 ] . Miller et al. (2020) demonstrated the worldwide spatial distribution of COVID-19  cases  using the heat map technique in  GIS  The  map reported that   China, Italy, Iran ,  and Spain were the highest affected countries till March 17,   2020, which was also visible by the  J HU  and WHO  reported data  [ 74 ] .   Spatial panel data model used by Guliyev (2020)   showed that the rate of deaths had a significant positive effect where  the  recovery rate had a negative with the confirmed COVID-19 cases   [ 76 ] .   Irvine et al. (2020)  used a SEIR  model to estimate the transmission  rate  within Immigration and Customs Enforcement (I .C.E. ) detention facilities in the  GIS  and  the impacts on the I .C.U.  capacity   [ 77 ] ."
"48" "Bai (2020) used two different models ,  including SEIRD model and Agent-Based Model (A .B.M. ) to simulate the COVID-19 spread. They found that A .B.M.  could be more effective and it also could be a useful tool to figure out new effective strategies  [ 78 ] .  In a similar work,  Mollalo et al. (2020) compared 5 different models to develop a spatial model of COVID-19 incidence rate considering 35 variables using geospatial  software’s . The results showed that MGWR could be a better model  as  it  was able  explain 68.1% of the total variation of COVID-19 incidence s  in the  GIS   [ 79 ] . In a follow-up paper, the same authors used ANN to model the incidence rate of COVID-19 and used Moran's I index to create  i ncidence  hotspot s .  Out of included  57 variables ,  10 variables found  statistically significant in explaining  the result  [ 80 ] .  A similar global scale study  revealed that age and population density have a statistically significant relationship with the spatial distribution pattern  of  COVID-19  cases   [ 81 ] ."
"49" "U sing Maxent based Ecological Niche Model, Ren et al. (2020) developed a potential risk zone map  of  China where population, public transportation  demands , medical resources  demands  were used as explanatory variables. They suggested  using  this as an early forecasting model to predict  the  risk zone in China ' s other megacities  [ 82 ] . Kanga et al. (2020), on the other hand, provided  a useful  recommendation to local authorities in India by using proximity-based hot spot analysis to map the risk zones with relevant preventative measures to mitigate  the  COVID-19 crisis  [ 83 ] .   Several other works  w ere  focused on suitability mapping with a focus to find  a  suitable location for  the  quarantine zone in Surat, India ,  using ArcGIS. The study revealed that the suitability analysis could help to control the spread as a prevention measure."
"50" "Data mining  and COVID-19"
"51" "We  grouped  the application  of  big data, social media data  mining ,  and  contact  tracing  through  geospatial technologies  together . Although  very  few studies attempted to incorporate those techniques in COVID-19 research , a  total of  8  articles were identified that emphasized  on data mining, big  data,  and social media data use  in COVID-19  [61, 84-90] .  Data mining using  unsupervised Machine Learning models were utilized in a study  to analyze the twitter data  and  it  reported  tweets related to  symptoms of users  is  associat ed  with COVID-19 testing  accessibility  [ 62 ] .  Studies also used   N ighttime  L ight (NTL) data and AQI data to analyze the spatial and temporal pattern of COVID-19 and how that impacted human activities. The observation demonstrated that the NTL brightness and AQI value were much lower during the quarantine period in Mainland China  [ 84 ] .   Similarly,  radar data  was used  to detect traffic patterns  where the findings reported that  the number of heavy vehicles  movement in the region   changed  significantly  after  the COVID outbreak  [ 85 ] ."
"52" "Several studies used mobile sensor data or geodata for contact tracing as a surveillance strategy to monitor COVID-19  [ 86-88 ] .  Wang et al. (2020) developed a Geo-AI based  mini program  within  an instant messaging  app  (WeChat)  to trace close contacts of all  confirmed patients . The results showed that the program could analyze real-time data to trace the contacts ,  and those data could be used with other datasets to find out more  useful  information to reduce COVID-19 spread.  Similarly, other studies also attempted to develop a smart contact tracing app   using big data analytics   [ 86 ]  or  using  a  mobile sensor-based contact tracing system to minimize the COVID-19 spread   [ 87 ] . Using social media post s , Huang et al. (2020)  examined  the  attributes  of  both  suspected  and  confirmed COVID-19  cases who contacted with the symptoms.  They used SP SS and ArcGIS for descriptive statistical analysis and spatial analysis, where they found  that  most of the patients seeking help were above 65 years old from Wuhan  [ 89 ] ."

"631" "Discussion"
"632" "To the best of our knowledge, t his  review  is one of the first systematic review of the application of  GIS  and other geospatial technologies in COVID-19 related scientific works. Our work does not only provide an overview of how  GIS  was used so far but also provides pointers on how  GIS  could be more efficiently used in COVID-19 related works and other public health issues in the coming days. The application of  GIS  technologies and spatial analysis had influenced the understanding of COVID-19 significantly, not only for the scientific community but also for the policymakers, and for the public in building a long term response to the ongoing pandemic  [ 90 ] . Initially, spatial analysis techniques were used as part of predictive modeling to predicts the growth of COVID-19 cases  [ 59 ]  and to model the  Spatio -temporal variation of confirmed incidences  [ 70 ] . With the increasing availability of COVID-19 data, a significant number of studies started to analyze the spatial transmission pattern and spread of the virus from Wuhan to other cities in China and the rest of the world  [ 13 ,  14 ,  16 ,  18 ,  22 ,  63 ,  67 ,  85 ,  91 ] . Most of these early applications of  GIS  and spatial analysis were more focused on visualizing the COVID-19 confirmed cases as well as the distribution of cases among administrative units and countries. However, as time goes on and more data became available, more complex gis tools come into play. Studies not only used  GIS  for analyzing different environmental aspects; they also used different earth observation data acquired by European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA  [ 19 ,  20 ,  24 ,  30 ] ."
"633" "During the early days, one of the biggest discussions among the researchers was regarding the ability of meteorological factors to limit the spread of coronavirus. With the declaration of the pandemic and subsequent lockdown globally in early March, several studies used GIS and remotely sensed images to analyze the impacts of this lockdown on the environment, air quality, and other particulate matters  [17, 22, 25] . Several studies evaluated that relationship with the help of spatial analytical tools, and most of these studies could not reach a valid conclusion where they could claim temperature or other climatic factors do limit the spread of the virus  [22, 23, 26, 29] . Later application of GIS does not restrict itself in just visualizing. Instead, it was more used to spatial autocorrelation and clustering analysis, hotspot analysis, and suitability analysis to see whether any association exists among social and economic groups, any specific location or social group, and COVID-19 infection rate  [54, 55, 58] . With the increasing confirmed cases around the world, different social-science studies analyzed the association among COVID-19 infection rate and social vulnerability, racial inequality, risk perception, resiliency, and settlement quality issues  [43, 44, 46] . These studies also utilized GIS to identify any spatial patterns and autocorrelation with COVID-19."
"634" "We reviewed how GIS and spatial analysis techniques were used in the past COVID-19 related studies. We found that most of the included studies used GIS for visualizing the spatial distribution and pattern of COVID-19 spread, cluster analysis to identify the accumulation of cases, hot spot analysis to find out any outbreak, proximity analysis to evaluate the accessibility to the primary health care facilities. However, with time, studies focused on different models to predict or simulate various aspects of COVID-19 using geospatial techniques that were published as well. On that point of interest, GIS-based Maxent model, spatial data panel model, SEIR model, Agent-Based Model, GWR, MGWR, ANN were used in different studies  [ 76-80 ,  82 ] . However, we did not find any studies that used spatially explicit modeling to identify and predict the location of any potential outbreak in the future. One of the few positive aspects of COVID-19 related studies is the publicly available data, and the same was noticed in the review as well. We found that more than half of the studies used data from some form of government database followed by WHO database (n=12), different websites (n=12), JHU dashboard and Worldometers (n=9), Social media data (n=8), satellite images (n=7), primary survey(3 study) and mobile phone data (n=3)."
"635" "Though COVID-19 related data is mostly publicly available, some studies reported data unavailability issues, especially in developing or less developed countries  [ 28 ,  45 ,  80 ] . The major challenge of global or regional studies is the possibility of an under-reported number of confirmed cases, especially in low-income regions, because of the low detection coverage of COVID-19, which may skew the result. Most of the global or regional studies cannot incorporate the controlling measures imposed by different governments, which has significant impacts on the spread and infection incidences of COVID-19 cases. No consideration of government control measures and low testing issues is also a substantial limitation for modeling and prediction focused research which creates a biased result. Therefore, future studies should emphasize considering government control measures and policies in their modeling. Though contract tracing and data mining research has been proven to be useful in analyzing and forecasting the spatial pattern of COVID dispersion, no trace of any studies were found outside of China and the USA. That might be due to data unavailability and technological issues. Contract tracing in China was possible due to its government-backed app that gathers a user's information, including name, ID number, and health information and movement data. Two studies were conducted in China and Taiwan for smart contract tracing using mobile sensor data  [ 86 ,  88 ] . Low or middle-income countries can adopt a GIS-based volunteered surveillance approach where peoples will share their information voluntarily to tackle the pandemic. So far, GIS has not been used much to track the transmission pattern and to predict the transmission. That is something that can be done at a global level to leverage GIS to predict not only the confirmed case numbers but also specific locations where the outbreak would happen with higher statistical precision  [ 92 ] ."
"636" "The findings of this review ha ve  profound implications for contemporary and future multidisciplinary scientific research, policymaking, and practice.  The diverse use of GIS technologies in different overarching thematic areas of scientific research highlights the potential of incorporating methodological perspectives for solving complex research questions. This evolution is consistent with the  emerging  perspective that “one size does not fit all” and each unique scenario may require conceptual and empirical inputs from different disciplines for achieving a higher precision on research outcomes.  Nonetheless, an increasing trend of integrating GIS technologies in studies that emphasized on multiple research objectives show how  such technologies are being a part of the entire work rather than the only approach used in those research efforts. Thus, the use of GIS may improve  other methodological measures and increase the scope of scientific exploration on a topic of interest."
"637" "The existing evidence highlights the use of GIS and other geospatial techniques for addressing research question, however, little evidence exists on how geospatial can be used for delivering digital interventions for individuals or target populations. Perhaps such technological innovations would take much time to appear, but precision sciences and their applications on personalizing user level platforms may bring such technologies more closer to everyday practice.  Moreover, a wide range of data sources used in different studies included in this review provide meaningful insights on how data from multiple can be harmonized and utilized in addressing population-based problems. Furthermore, integrating GIS in COVID-19 related research may enable real-time decision-making for preventing public health crises and deploying resources whenever required. A major learning from existing studies is to developing local and global disaster preparedness plans that may enable policymakers and practitioners to leverage GIS-based advanced data analytics for mitigating large scale public health emergencies. More implementation research is needed to assess the scope of such multipronged yet coordinated response systems that may emerge in the post-pandemic world.  Such initiatives may require strengthening technological capacities in low and middle - income countries that share a major proportion of global health problems, yet have limited resources to address the same  [ 93 ,  94 ] ."
"638" "Despite notable  strengths, this systematic review has several limitations that should be acknowledged and addressed in future research. First, the selection of databases and keywords could have excluded some studies that were indexed in other databases or used non-specified keywords, which were beyond the scope of this review. Second, we focused on peer-reviewed publications  that  did not cover preprints that did not undergo peer-review; therefore, those studies are also excluded from this review that may provide further insights on the evidence landscape. Third,  the existing literature show s  a high heterogeneity in methods, data inputs, and research outcomes leading to a narrative synthesis. Future evidence-based reviews may consider  the  quantitative synthesis of homogenous studies on specific themes. This systematic review  provides  an inclusive and extensive synthesis of multidisciplinary research using GIS during COVID-19, which may inform future primary studies and advanced syntheses addressing the current limitations and improving the knowledge base in this domain."
"639" "Conclusion"
"640" "This systematic review   evaluated the current literature on the use of GIS and geospatial ana l yses in the context of COVID-19 pandemic and explored the scope of integrating such techniques in the current research efforts as well as future research and practice.   In the era of digital revolution, a growing need for exchanging technological advancements across scientific disciplines is widely acknowledged. The use of GIS and related technologies in COVID-19 pandemic examplifies such integrations and provide scholarly perspectives on how complex societal and global issues can be understood using the existing tools. Moreover, such applications necessitate revisiting the current stren gt hs and weaknesses of curating evidence   across contexts. It is essential to stren gt hen ing   institutional capacities to leverage GIS-related technologies in multipronged research and development   that empower research communities to work together in this pandemic. Last but not least,   future technological innovations should be  grounded on the lessons learned during this pandemic to make such technologies   readily available for facilitating robust research and decision-making that   may   improve population-level outcomes globally."
