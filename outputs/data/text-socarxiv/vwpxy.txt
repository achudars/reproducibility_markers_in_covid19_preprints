The First Local Lockdown
Anthon Dixon, Kate Bowers, Nick Tilley, Graham Farrell

A ‘local lockdown’ was introduced in Leicester city on 29 June: the city had < 1% of the UK population but
10% of all positive COVID-19 cases the week before. We examine recorded crime in July, the first month.

Preliminary Findings
Fig 1 shows the most populous 10 cities in England and Wales. In July, total recorded crime increased
more in cities other than Leicester. Figs 2 and 3 shows total recorded crime and ASB increased in the
city but declined in the remainder of the county of Leicestershire. Fig 4 shows differences in shoplifting
and other theft were most apparent. Fig 5 shows weapons offences decreased in most cities including
Leicester. Fig 6 suggests no immediately discernible pattern in the proportion of Leicestershire’s crime in
the city in July 2020 relative to previous months in the year
