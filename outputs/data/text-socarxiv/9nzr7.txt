Abstract
The world is currently dealing with a devastating pandemic. Although growing COVID-19 case
numbers, deaths, and hospitalizations are concerning, this spread is particularly alarming in the
United States where polarizing opinions, changing policies, and misinformation abound. In
particular, American college campuses have been a venue of rampant transmission, with
concerning spillover into surrounding, more vulnerable, communities. We surveyed over 600
college students from across the United States and modeled predictors of compliance with nonpharmaceutical interventions. We identified concern with severity (p < .001), constitutional
originalist ideology (p < .001), news exposure (p < .001) and religiosity (p < .05) as significant
positive correlates with compliance, and general trust in science (p < .05) as a significant
negative correlate. To determine how applicable nationwide modeling might be to individual
local campuses we also administered this same survey to nearly 600 students at two large
universities in Utah County. In this population, concern with severity was the only significant
positive correlate with compliance (p < .001); Additionally, feelings of inconvenience was
negatively correlated (p < .001). The effects of feelings of inconvenience, and news exposure
were significantly different between populations (p < .001, p < .001). These results suggest that
we should focus our efforts on increasing knowledge about the pandemic’s effects on our
society and informing about constitutionality amongst college students. However, we also
show that nationwide surveys and modeling are informative, but if campuses are to efficiently
curb the spread of COVID-19 this coming semester, they would be best served to utilize data
collected from their student populations as these might significantly differ from general
consensus data.

Introduction
The emergence of the novel coronavirus Sars-Cov-2, which causes the disease COVID-19,
rapidly spread from an outbreak to a global pandemic (1). As of November 19, 2020, the World
Health Organization has reported nearly 56 million confirmed cases, and over 1.3 million deaths
globally (2), and other estimates have reported much higher numbers in both categories (3).
Additionally, the subsequent economic (4) and psychological (5) fallout from the pandemic have
been felt across the globe.
Experts have suggested that increased compliance with non-pharmaceutical
interventions could have reduced the consequences of the pandemic (6,7), and increased
compliance in the future could save tens of thousands of lives in America alone (3,8,9). Nonpharmaceutical interventions include wearing masks, practicing social distance, washing hands,
and sanitizing surfaces, among other things. A CDC study from 2008 found that most
Americans would be willing to practice mitigation measures to slow the spread of a pandemic
influenza (10), but this is not the reality that is seen today. Despite the scientific evidence
behind the efficacy of interventions such as masks (6,8,11–13), social distancing (11) and
increased handwashing (11), many Americans refuse to take these precautions (6,14–20).
The spread of COVID-19 has been of particular concern on university campuses. As of
November 19, 2020, there have been over 321,000 cases at over 1,700 American colleges and
universities (21). While college students are typically at a low risk for severe infection and
death, spread of COVID-19 on campuses has the potential to spill over into more vulnerable
communities adjacent to campuses (22,23). Additionally, long-term consequences of COVID-19
infections are not well understood (24), thus widespread infections amongst college students
could plausibly lead to complications in the future.
One instance where COVID-19 originating on a college campus, spread to the
surrounding community increasing case counts has been seen in Utah County, Utah (USA) (25).
As of November 19, 2020, the state of Utah has reported nearly 166,000 total COVID-19 cases,
7,215 hospitalizations, and 756 deaths (26). Doctors and public health officials have warned of
the strain on Utah’s healthcare system, as ICU capacity has been exceeded in several major
hospitals across the state (27–30). Two weeks after seeing a spike in cases, Utah’s governor
declared a “COVID-19 State of Emergency” (31). Overall, 8,881 cases have been reported at 10
universities and colleges, however 2,993 have been reported at one of the state’s larger
universities (21). During the time the survey in this study was administered, the United States
had approximately 9.3 million total cases of COVID-19, and Utah County had reported
approximately 30,000 cases (26).
Work has been conducted in the United States and internationally to identify predictors
of compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions. On an international level Clark et al. (32)
found that a belief in the effectiveness of precautionary measures was a significant predictor of
whether individuals took precautions. Plohl and Musil (33) found that COVID-19 risk perception
and trust in science were able to independently predict compliance, and political conservatism,
religious orthodoxy, conspiracy ideation and intellectual curiosity were found to be predictors
via the mediating role of trust in science. In America, political conservatism and party
identification have consistently been identified as predictors of precautionary behaviors; those
who identify as conservative and/or Republican are the least likely to be compliant, while those
who identify as liberal and/or Democrat are most likely to be compliant (15–20,34).

While there has been some modeling of compliance with non-pharmaceutical
interventions (referred to as NPIs for the remainder of this paper) amongst the general
population, to our knowledge there has not been any modeling of compliance amongst
undergraduate students, one of the populations that is greatly contributing to the spread of the
current pandemic. In this study we use structural equation modeling to identify the predictors
of compliance amongst university students across the country, and at large campuses in Utah
County that, as of the time of submission, were experiencing a large amount of community
spread among its students.
Materials Methods

Study Population
The nationwide survey was administered through the Qualtrics survey platform, with
parameters given to match the national profile of undergraduate students as reported by the
national center for education statistics (35). We targeted students currently enrolled in a
college or university. We used 608 responses in our analyses. The local survey (Utah Valley) was
administered to students enrolled in both general non-majors biology classes and entry level
majors biology classes at two Universities in Utah, one private institution with enrollment
around 35,000 students and one public institution with open-enrollment around 41,000
students, both located in Utah County. We used 566 responses in our analyses.
Survey Development
Literature Review and Interviews
To begin construction of our instrument we surveyed literature about predictors of COVID-19
compliance, and trust in science in general. We found 5 factors shown to be predictors of
compliance (table 1), and 3 plausible factors based on their influence on trust in science
generally (table 2).

We then conducted interviews with undergraduate students at one of the Utah County schools
to refine our instrument and test for validity. We asked students questions about their age,
major, political ideology, party identification, news source and exposure to news, feelings
regarding the government’s response to the pandemic, practice of NPIs, trust in science
generally, trust in medical science, trust in public health officials and their doctor, religiosity,
and acceptance of organic evolution. Interviews were transcribed using software from
temi.com and responses were coded by three students independently, who then collaboratively
agreed upon a score for each part of the interview transcript. From the most common themes
found in the surveys, we created a multiple-choice survey instrument.
We developed two surveys, one to be administered to students in Utah Valley, and
another that was sent to students nationwide. They were largely identical, with the exception
being that the nationwide survey asked students what type of institution they attended and
their gender, while the Utah Valley instrument asked respondents which university they
attended. We settled on the following demographics and latent variables.
Demographic Measures
We measured participant age, the type of institution the student attends (i.e., public/private, 4year institution, 2-year institution, trade school), where the students grew up, where the
students are currently attending college, and what year of college they are in. In addition, we
asked for student identified gender (only in the nationwide survey) as well as political party
identification (Democrat, Republican, Independent, or Other).
Latent Variables
We identified and measured the following latent variables:
Political ideology. To measure political ideology students were asked to rate their view of
economic, social and scientific views on a scale of 1 (meaning very left leaning or liberal) to 7
(meaning very right leaning or conservative).
Religiosity. To measure participant religiosity we chose to use the Duke Religiosity Index
(DUREL) (49) due to its brevity, and optimization for use in public health surveys. Question one
was changed from, How often did you attend church or other religious meetings? to, Before the
emergence of COVID-19, how often did you attend church or other religious meetings? We felt

that attendance at church or other religious meetings could currently be influenced by local
mandates about gatherings and fear of contracting COVID-19, and may not be an indicator of
religiosity at the present time.
Religiosity and COVID. Participants were asked to answer which response most accurately
described their view of each of the following statements with a scale from 1 to 5 (Definitely not
true, tends not to be true, unsure, tends to be true, definitely true of me): My religion influences
my beliefs about the current COVID-19 pandemic; My religion influences my approach to the
current COVID-19 pandemic; and My religious beliefs shape how I have interacted with others
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
General trust in science. For this section, we consulted Nadelson et al. (2014) (50). Their twentyone-item instrument is designed to assess the level of trust an individual has in the scientific
method and scientists. The concept of trust is difficult to define, and even more difficult to
measure. However, based on the literature, we believe trust in science to be one of the best
predictors of compliance with recommended COVID-19 health practices. Furthermore, we
believe that the Nadelson et al. instrument adequately assesses a person’s trust in science.
Participants were asked to answer the following questions on a 5-pt Likert-type scale:
1. Scientists ignore evidence that contradicts their work.
2. Scientific theories are weak explanations.
3. Scientists intentionally keep their work secret.
4. Scientists don’t value the ideas of others.
5. We should trust the work of scientists.
6. We should trust that scientists are being honest in their work.
7. We should trust that scientists are being ethical in their work.
8. Scientific theories are trustworthy.
9. We can trust science to find the answers that explain the natural world.
10. We cannot trust scientists because they are biased in their perspectives.
11. Scientists will protect each other even when they are wrong.
12. We cannot trust scientists to consider ideas that contradict their own.
13. Today’s scientists will sacrifice the well being of others to advance their research.
14. We cannot trust science because it moves too slowly.
We removed questions 1, 5, 7, 8, 13, 14, and 16 from the original Nadelson instrument based
on rationale provided by Plohl and Musil (33).
Trust in public health officials. The trust in public health officials is a modification of Nadelson et
al. (50). We rephrased the questions to use the phrase ‘public health authority’, which we
defined as follows: “For this next section, you will see the term ‘public health authority’ used a
number of times. We are using this term to mean individuals employed by tax-funded
government health agencies, whether that be local, state, or federal. Specifically, a public
health authority communicates with the public with statements about health concerns and
recommended health practices. A prominent example would be Anthony Fauci, M.D., director
of NIAID (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases).” We believe this definition to
provide a clear and easily understood definition of the term, as well as providing a colloquial

example for reference. We believe ‘public health authority’ is a politically weighted term that is
commonly used. Participants were asked to answer the following questions on a 5-pt Likerttype scale:
1. When public health authorities provide conflicting advice, it diminishes my trust in their
work.
2. Public health authorities ignore evidence that contradicts their work.
3. Public health authorities intentionally keep some information secret.
4. Public health authorities are seeking to fulfill an agenda.
5. Public health authorities don’t value the ideas of others.
6. I trust that public health authorities want to make life better for people.
7. We should trust that public health authorities are being honest in their work.
8. We should trust that public health authorities are being ethical in their work.
9. When public health authorities give health instruction, they are just guessing.
10. We cannot trust public health authorities because they are biased in their perspectives.
11. We cannot trust public health authorities to consider ideas that contradict their own.
12. Today’s public health authorities will sacrifice the well-being of others to advance their
agenda.
In question 12, the word “research” was changed to “agenda” from the original Nadelson et al.
instrument. We removed questions from the original Nadelson instrument that did not fit with
our topic of focus in the interest of clarity and brevity, leaving us with 12 questions.
Priorities of Public Health Officials. Blendon et al. (10) asked respondents which of a public
health official’s duties was most important. For comparison to understand how attitudes
towards public health officials may have shifted, we repeated this question, and instead asked
respondents to rank the following priorities of public health officials: to Treat everyone as
equally as possible; Protect the health of the greatest number of people; Give priority to sick and
frail people in getting attendance; Aim to preserve essential community services like electricity
and law enforcement; and To not interfere with the civil liberties or freedoms of people in your
communities.
Constitutionalism. Participants were asked to answer which response was closest to their view
of each of the following statements on a five-point Likert scale (Definitely not true, tends not to
be true, unsure, tends to be true, definitely true of me): I don’t mind masks, but mask mandates
are unconstitutional; Mask mandates interfere with my constitutional rights; Mask mandates
interfere with my personal freedoms; COVID-19 restrictions restrict my constitutional rights; I
have the constitutional right to refuse to wear a mask in public; and Wearing a mask should be
a personal choice, not a legal mandate. We created this section of the questionnaire because
we found in our preliminary interviews that constitutionalism was a common theme for those
who refused to wear a mask, and we hypothesized that many only refused to wear a mask
because of their ideas about their constitutional rights.

Convenience. Many of our questions for the convenience portion of the survey were based on
the information that was found in a survey sent out by YouGov (15). The questions were slightly
modified to fit our needs. Participants were asked to rank the following statements on a 5-point
Likert scale (Definitely not true, tends not to be true, unsure, tends to be true, definitely true of
me): The discomfort of a mask is enough to make me not wear them; Physical issues (e.g.,
glasses fogging up, facial breakouts, difficulty breathing) prevent me from wearing a mask; The
lack of availability of masks prevents me from wearing one; and Forgetting to bring a mask with
me is often a reason I don’t wear one.
Concern with severity. To test for perceived impression of severity of the COVID-19 virus we
asked four questions modified from a 2007 study on barriers to flu vaccines (51). In that survey
respondents were asked: “How concerned are you about getting the flu?” and “How would
getting the flu affect your life?”. Both of these questions had three possible answer choices. We
changed the answer scale to a five-point scale for more statistical power. We changed the
wording of their questions to apply to COVID-19, for example, instead of asking, “How
concerned are you about getting the flu?”, we asked “How concerned are you with getting
COVID-19?”. We separated the second question into two questions and adjusted it to be
COVID-19 specific. We asked about how they felt the novel coronavirus could affect them
physically, and how they thought it could affect other aspects of their life. We added one more
question asking about how they felt the novel coronavirus would affect others in their
community. This question was added to give us the greater statistical power associated with
four questions instead of two.
Personal responsibility. In a thorough search of the literature no studies were found that
correlated personal responsibility to a role in compliance with non-pharmaceutical methods of
decreasing viral infection. We did find one study that researched public risk perceptions,
personal responsibility, and self-isolation habits during the recent COVID-19 pandemic (52). As
they mostly focused on self-isolation habits, no survey instrument from their study could
reasonably be used in our survey. Another study analyzes how different social norms including
both impression of severity and personal responsibility affect compliance to precautionary
guidelines, but this study didn’t involve surveys of any kind, thus, no instrument was developed
(53). We mimicked the way questions were asked in the Baal research study and asked our
respondents to rank the following five statements on a seven-point Likert scale (from Strongly
Disagree to Strongly Agree): I shouldn’t be mandated to wear a mask because those who are at
high risk for contracting the virus should be responsible for keeping themselves safe; I am
responsible for the health of others in my community*; Everyone should take responsibility for
their own health and act accordingly; Those who are at high risk should stay out of public
places, rather than having everyone else take precautions for their health; and I should feel
responsible and take action to protect the health of those most vulnerable in the population*
(with asterisks indicating reverse-coded items).
Exposure to News. We formulated our own questions regarding news exposure based on the
results from our preliminary interviews. In the interviews, we asked the questions, “Do you
keep up with science-related news?” and, “Do you keep up with COVID-19 related news?”

Students had various responses to how well they kept up with these specific news types, so we
decided to gauge how often they checked both science and COVID-19 related news on a 6-point
Likert scale of everyday to never. Additionally, to gauge how often students kept up with nonscience and COVID-19 related news, we used the same scale (everyday to never).
Precautionary behaviors. After conducting the preliminary interviews, we found that students
had given various responses on their extent of mask wearing, social distancing, and hand
washing. For mask wearing, we found that there were certain situations where students were
more or less likely to wear masks. From this, we asked students to rank their mask wearing, on
a scale of always to never, for three distinct situations: where masks are required, in small
groups of individuals not of their immediate household, and in large groups and outdoors
within six feet of others. Additionally, we created questions using the same scale (always to
never) to address the extent of social distancing, hand washing, and sanitizing nearby surfaces
(the full survey is available in the Supplemental Materials).
Statistical Analysis of Survey
We split each dataset (from Utah County and from the General population) in half and created
two datasets, each consisting of approximately 300 Utah respondents and 300 General
respondents. We used one dataset to conduct Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) on our
instruments and the other to conduct Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). EFA was performed
using Geomin rotation and a scree plot, eigenvalues, and percentage variance explained were
used to determine which factors to retain. Items were removed in order to reach the best
fitting model for the latent variables. For the CFA model, we used several fit indices, including
Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), comparative fit index (CFI), root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA), and Chi square statistics. A CFA was then performed both on the General population
and the Utah population to confirm fit of the model. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was
then performed on each individual full dataset (Utah and General) to create two models
(Muthen and Muthen, 1998-2010). The models were compared for invariance of structural
path coefficients across groups using the DIFFTEST command. EFA, CFA, SEM, and DIFFTEST
procures were performed using the Mplus software, version 8.
Exploratory Factor Analysis. EFA was performed on the latent variables in the model
that were created for this instrument. (General trust in science was excluded from EFA analysis
since it was a previously published and validated instrument). EFA rendered 6 factors with
eigenvalues above 1 that explained over 5% of the variance. These factors, used as our
predictors, were Concern with severity, Constitutionality, Convenience, Exposure to news,
Political ideology, Religiosity (note that general religiosity and religiosity regarding the
pandemic did not sort as two independent factors and were therefore left as one), and General
trust in science. The General Trust in Science instrument was modified for better fit by
removing all reverse-coded items (Items 5-9), which did not appear to be functioning well with
the data. The outcome variable, Precautionary behaviors, had to be modified by removing
three items (behavior in large groups, hand washing, and sanitizing surfaces) to get marginal fit.
However, CFA confirmed a good fit with the data. Trust in public health officials and Personal

responsibility appeared to not offer a good fit to the data and no significant relationships to our
outcome variables so we chose to remove them from the analysis.
Confirmatory Factor Analysis. We used CFA to confirm the match of our instrument to
the intended latent variables. Using the combined second half of each dataset, we found
marginal fit statistics (RMSEA = 0.06; CFI = 0.89; TLI = 0.88; SRMR = 0.07; χ2 = 1446.09, p < .001);
however, we suspected that populations were not behaving equivalently and therefore
expected potential issues with fit. We alternatively performed a CFA on each individual dataset
and found acceptable fit statistics within each population, as listed in Table 3. Factor loadings
for each latent variable are shown in Figure 1.

Comparison between populations
To compare our populations, we summed the total score in each category (e.g., political
conservatism, concern, compliance with NPIs, etc.) for each individual. The data were not
normally distributed, so we used a two-sample sign test to compare our Utah Valley and
general populations.
Results
Interview Results
Our interviews were highly informative. While our sample size was small, we observed
the following patterns which are reflected in our instrument:
• Those who specifically mentioned that their religiosity influenced their attitude about
the pandemic tended to take NPIs more seriously, even when compared to those who
had a high religiosity in general.
• View of governmental response was captured by political party and ideology.

Initial SEM Model
Based on our interviews and literature surveys we developed the theoretical model shown in
figure 2. We hypothesized that impressions of severity, belief in the importance of personal
responsibility, belief in personal liberty, feelings of inconvenience, news exposure, political
ideology, religiosity, religious views on the pandemic, trust in science and trust in public health
officials would all directly influence taking precautionary behaviors. We also hypothesized that
political ideology, religiosity, and the influence of religious views on the pandemic would
influence precautionary behaviors through the intermediate of trust in science; and news
exposure and political ideology would affect precautionary behaviors through the mediating
factor of trust in public health officials.

factors. Lines indicate predictive relationships.
Structural Equation Modeling
SEM analysis on the General population indicated that Concern about the severity of
COVID-19, News exposure, and Religiosity all positively predicted precautionary behaviors. In
contrast, feelings of Constitutionality issues negatively impact a student’s willingness to
practice precautionary behaviors. Interestingly, a students’ general trust in science had a slight
negative correlation with practicing precautionary behaviors. Surprisingly, political ideology
and feelings of inconvenience did not affect behaviors. We included both gender and age in the
model as covariates, but neither were significant. The structural model, shown in Figure 3,

showed robust fit to the data as indicated by fit statistics and probability scores (RMSEA = 0.05;
CFI = 0.90; TLI = 0.89; SRMR = 0.06; c = 2079.34, p < .001).

*p < .05, **p < .001
SEM analysis on the Utah County population indicated some differences from the
General population. The only positive predictor of taking precautionary behaviors was a
concern with severity. The only negative predictor was feelings of inconvenience. In other
words, those who felt that the disease impact is more severe were more likely to take
precautionary behaviors, whereas those not wearing a mask are most likely refraining out of
inconvenience. We included age in the model as a covariate but it was not significant (gender
was not asked on the Utah County population survey). Again, the structural model, shown in
Figure 4, showed robust fit to the data as indicated by fit statistics and probability scores
(RMSEA = 0.05; CFI = 0.92; TLI = 0.91; SRMR = 0.05; c = 1826.86, p < .001).

A comparison of the models for invariability of structural path coefficients across groups
indicated that the two factors that varied significantly between populations were feelings of
inconvenience (2 = 17.94, p < .001) and exposure to news (2 = 16.74, p < .001). All other
comparisons between populations were non-significant.
Comparisons Between Populations
Our sample from Utah County was significantly less conservative (p < .001), more
religious (p <.001), less constitutionalist (p <.001), more trusting in science (p <.001), less
concerned with the pandemic (p <.001), earlier in their college careers (p < .001), and younger
(p <.001) than the general population; News exposure was not significantly different between
the populations (Table 4).

sample was significantly more likely to wear a mask in small groups of close associates from
outside their household (p < .001), to wear a mask in large groups within six feet of others (p <

Discussion
We surveyed students spread across the nation and within Utah County and ran SEM
analysis on each population separately. Although much of our discussion is focused on the
differences between populations, we feel the uniqueness of the Utah County population
discussed is important. This demonstrates that nationwide opinions on COVID-19 data may not
reflect the opinions and subsequent compliance NPI of students in various localities.
Nonetheless, we feel the national data is a valuable resource for anyone trying to understand
shifting opinions on COVID-19.
Significant Predictors
Within the nationwide survey of college students, two of the strongest predictors for
compliance with NPIs were a concern with the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and
exposure to news (Figure 2). This suggests that a potential method for achieving widespread
compliance with precautionary behaviors could be an increase in media promoting the
behaviors and warning of the severity of the pandemic. Another significant predictor in the

general population was ideas of constitutional originalist ideologies. Those individuals with
stronger beliefs that their personal constitutional rights and liberties were being infringed upon
by COVID regulations were less likely to comply with NPIs. The constitutionality of mask
mandates has been largely debated in the news; thus, this result is not surprising (54). It may
also be due to some of the more nuanced political views of young conservatives (55).
In the Utah population, results differed slightly (Figure 3). There was a strong positive
correlation between concern with severity and precautionary behaviors, but a strong negative
correlation between convenience and precautionary behaviors. This suggests that in the Utah
population, if compliance with mask wearing is deemed inconvenient, then individuals likely
will not comply.
Non-significant Predictors
Aspects of our research were surprising and some even contrary to our initial
predictions. For example, political ideology was not a predictor of compliance in either the Utah
population or the general population. Although contrary to polling from earlier in the
pandemic, this is in line with another recent publication which also found no strong correlation
between political ideology and attitudes towards a future COVID-19 vaccine (56). Age was also
not a predictor of compliance with precautionary behaviors in either population; however, age
was rather homogenous between populations due to our targeted sample. Gender was not a
predictor in the general population (gender was not measured in the Utah population).
We were especially surprised that the general trust in science was not a strong predictor
of compliance in either population, although it was somewhat negative in the general
population. Based on rationale provided by Nadelson et al. (50), we believed that mistrust in
science (and medical science in particular) stemmed from a lack of understanding of how the
scientific process operates. No correlation was found in the Utah population. In the general
population a weakly negative correlation was found a trust in science and compliance with
NPIs, meaning that the more trust an individual had in science, the less likely they were to
comply with NPIs. This is an interesting finding and may reflect an idea that those who feel like
they have a good understanding of the science may be less worried about the pandemic. The
lack of strong correlation in either population may be due to the demographic we were
surveying. We propose that perhaps because our population of college students likely had a
similar basic level of exposure to scientific learning, we did not have enough variation in our
data to detect meaningful correlations between trust in science and compliance to NPIs .
Religiosity was weakly correlated with compliance with precautionary behaviors in the general
population, and not correlated at all in the Utah population. The religious demographic in Utah
County is predominantly members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (CJCLDS)
(57). It comes as no surprise that a more nuanced range of beliefs within a relatively
homogenous religious culture were displayed. The Utah population differed from the general
population in that the factors constitutionality and exposure to news were not significantly
correlated with compliance, although only news exposure showed path inequalities in the
modeling.
Differences Between Populations

With roughly half our survey given to students living in Utah County and the other half
given to students spread out across the nation, we expected the populations to differ
moderately. As we take a deeper look into the differences between the two populations, we
feel it is important to re-emphasize that universities across the country should consider the
implications this could have to their own hometown, university, or area of residence. As
different as the Utah findings are from the rest of the United States, we suspect a multitude of
uniquely different pockets of opinions nationwide.
The demographics of our sample from Utah County were markedly different than those
of the general population (Table 4), which could explain some of the differences seen in
correlates (Figure 2, Figure 3), and in compliance with NPIs (Table 5). Although there were
minimal differences in the effect of many predictors, we found that there were two categories
whose effects differed significantly between the Utah population and the general population,
inconvenience (p < .001) and exposure to news (p < .001). Convenience was much more
relevant in the Utah population with a correlation factor of -0.371, while the general population
had a correlation factor of -0.133 (Figure 2, Figure 3). We believe the difference in these factors
stems from the large age difference between populations. The median age in our Utah sample
was 20, compared to 30 from the general sample (p < .001). We believe many of the other
differences, including conservatism, trust in science, constitutionalism, and concern for the
severity of the pandemic, are also potentially due to the younger age of the Utah County
population.
One of the most striking differences between populations was the wearing of masks in
small groups (Table 5). As has been mentioned earlier, many of those surveyed in Utah were
members of the CJCLDS (58). Like typical university students, those we surveyed in Utah live
with roommates and potentially have family members who live close by. Unlike a typical
university, students in Utah are likely part of a highly active church community, as well. A 2016
Pew research poll found that Latter-Day Saints (CJCLDS) were among the most highly involved
with their congregations (59), and church members have been described by experts as “the
most pro-social members in American society”(60). With a difference in wearing a mask in small
gatherings significantly lower than the general population it is likely that, because of the
sociality of this culture, a “small group” or “bubble” could be interpreted differently than the
rest of America. It is important to note that officials of the Church (CJCLDS) in Utah have
encouraged members to follow guidelines (61,62).
During July of 2020 CJCLDS members residing in Utah valley received a letter from their
ecclesiastical leaders strongly encouraging “all Latter-Day saints in the Utah Area to be good
citizens by wearing face coverings while in public” (62). This advice early on in the pandemic
likely correlates to some of the trends we see now. The only NPI in which the Utah population
exceeded the general population was wearing a mask when it is mandatory (Table 5). While the
mean score in Utah for wearing a mask when it is mandatory was slightly higher, it was notably
higher than the other NPI scores in Utah. While we can only speculate at this time, the
encouragement by church leaders provides a compelling reason for many Latter-Day Saints to
comply publicly with NPIs.
The effect of exposure to news was the other significant difference between the
populations. This category was much more significant in the general population with a
correlation factor of 0.391 in the general population and a correlation factor of -0.009 in the

Utah population (Figure 2, Figure 3). Utah and the general population had about the same
amount of exposure to news as the general population (Table 4) but, it was not an indicator of
compliance in Utah. This suggests that perhaps the Utah population watched different news
sources. A recent poll found that 56% of Utahns get their news online (63) compared to 37% of
all Americans (64). Research has demonstrated that news sources can have a large influence on
taking precautionary behaviors (65).
Religiosity scores proved to be one of the starker differences between the Utah
population and the rest of the nation. Utah County is a highly religious community and may
potentially provide useful insights into other religious communities. As stated earlier, the
predominant religion in Utah County is CJCLDS, with one of the Universities surveyed being
affiliated with that church. Religion, and especially the religious views of Latter-Day Saints, has
proven in the past to be an important factor in political stances, trust in science, and
evolutionary acceptance (47,66,67).
At the time the survey was administered political tension was high. Some news outlets
around the time of the election reported skepticism of Latter-day Saints towards President
Donald Trump (68,69). We submit this as one possible explanation for the lower score in
conservatism among the traditionally more conservative Utah population. The students
surveyed in Utah were selected from a mix of non-major and major specific introductory
biology classes. As an additional explanation for the lower Utah scores on conservatism, we
suggest that this population may have had higher proportions of science majors compared with
the national average. While we are unaware of any studies looking at undergraduate biology
students in particular, it is noteworthy that the scientific community is more left-leaning than
the public as a whole (70), and was much more likely to support then-Democratic presidential
candidate Joe Biden (71). In addition several major journals in the field of biology endorsed Joe
Biden for president of the United States (72,73). It is possible that these factors could have
tilted our Utah sample to the left, ideologically. The last explanation for the more liberal Utah
population is the age difference. A 2019 Pew research poll found Generation Z to lean a little
more liberal than older generations, a difference especially pronounced among Gen-Zers who
identify as Republican (55).
Limitations
A quick search of a popular government funded medical search engine reveals over 75,000
published papers on COVID-19 thus far. Due to the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic, we
recognize that any survey published on the subject will be highly specific to the time frame it
was published in. The survey was administered from October 14th to November 10th, 2020, in
the midst of a heated United States presidential election. According to recent research, risk
perception of COVID-19 is based highly upon the statements and actions of political leaders
(52). During the time of an election, individuals are often highly involved in politics, thus their
views on COVID-19 may be influenced by politics more than usual. Additionally, this was before
Pfizer (74) and Moderna (75) had released promising phase 3 results about their vaccines. We
acknowledge that these events may have, as of yet, not understood consequences into the
modeling of our compliance with NPIs.
Conclusions

The SEM results from our survey of college students across the country can serve as a
framework for universities to increase compliance. While we have not conducted any research
on interventions, it is reasonable to conclude that addressing these predictors would increase
the efficacy of interventions. It is important to note that predictors in our local sample
significantly differed from our national population in the effect of convenience and news
exposure on compliance. This suggests that it is highly likely that interventions at individual
universities will be most effective when based upon data gathered in individual communities.
For example, if officials in Utah were to base interventions on our national data, they may
overemphasize sharing generic COVID news, and underemphasize increasing the convenience
of compliance, making their interventions less effective than they could be.
Vaccines are on the horizon, but it will likely be months before they are available to the
general public. COVID-related case numbers, deaths, and hospitalizations will continue to rise
through the winter (76,77), and may very well persist for the following months, and even years
(78). We call on universities across the country to survey their students, and better understand
why they may, or may not, be compliant with NPIs. If this is not possible, we suggest they apply
our general results, and results from other nationwide surveys. We believe doing so could be an
important step for mitigating spread on campuses, and the subsequent overflow into
surrounding populations.
Unfortunately, this will likely not be the last public health emergency or pandemic in the
near future, especially as humans encroach further upon nature (79–82). We believe it is vital to
learn all we can about combatting this pandemic, and we call on researchers across the globe to
work on understanding predictors of compliance, so interventions can be prepared for the next
outbreak.
