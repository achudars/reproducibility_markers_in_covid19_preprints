Abstract
The pandemic of 2020 was a watershed moment for all educators worldwide as schools and
universities were forced to close their doors to avoid the spread of COVID-19. Thus, a new
movement towards widespread e-learning emerged with unknown consequences for learners and
educators alike. The situation in Saudi Arabia was no exception. The purpose of this study is to
explore how English as a foreign language (EFL) teaching and learning at the tertiary level in
Saudi Arabia was impacted negatively and positively by the move to online learning. It reviews
research published since the onset of the pandemic, with a specific focus on English language
teaching at Saudi universities, to analyze the challenges faced by Saudi EFL teachers and
learners since the shift to e-learning. One of the biggest challenges observed was students’ lack
of motivation, which upon further review was found to be linked to other contributing factors,
such as technological issues, inapt learning environments, and students’ mental health. This
paper also examines the unforeseen positive outcomes resulting from the digital transformation,
including the benefits of the flexibility of place and time and promotion of particular language
skills. The current research synthesis will help contribute to the knowledge of online English
teaching in the Saudi context.

Introduction
The global community was hit hard by the worldwide pandemic produced by the Novel
Coronavirus (COVID-19) disease, which caused the whole world to come to a halt in 2020. In
such unprecedented times, educators worldwide were faced with the necessity of migrating to
online teaching. In-person learning became too much of a risk for contracting and spreading the
disease. This sudden, unprecedented shift comes with unknown consequences for educators, as
the world is still observing its effects. Thus, this article aims to provide an overview of the
educational scene in the Saudi English as a Foreign Language (EFL) context during the
pandemic and delineate the challenges and positive outcomes of online learning in Saudi Arabia
amidst the COVID-19 global pandemic. The following research questions guide the current
review:
1. What challenges do university students and instructors face with online learning and
teaching of EFL during the COVID-19 pandemic?
2. What are the perceived advantages to online learning during the COVID-19
pandemic?
These questions will be answered through a review of the most recent literature published in the
field of EFL and language education since the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Search words such
as “English language,” “Saudi universities,” “COVID-19,” and “EFL” were used to carry out the
investigation of the topic. The subsequent sections discuss Saudi Arabia’s response to the
pandemic, how schools and universities proceeded with education after closures, and previous
studies on e-learning in the Saudi context. Following that is a consideration of the most
prominent challenges Saudi university EFL educators and students face in online learning, as
well as positive outcomes observed as a result of the switch to online learning.
Literature Review
KSA’s Response to the Pandemic
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) was evident in its humanitarian message since the
beginning of the pandemic. That is, that human life is more valuable than anything, regardless of
race, gender, religion, or nationality. Therefore, within the first few days of March 2020, there
was an immediate response to shut down anything that would compromise people’s health and
well-being, including schools, universities, and public and private institutions (Nurunnabi, 2021).
However, this physical closure of buildings did not impede the country’s ambitious goals
and aspirations. Instead, it only increased them. As a response to the closures, all Saudi sectors
turned to digital technologies to help maintain services while thwarting the disease’s spread
(Hassounah et al., 2020), including education. In a brief timeframe, the whole country began the
transition to remote learning environments, whether it was televised on select channels or
communicated through various online platforms: Telegram, Zoom, Teams. WebEx, and
Blackboard. However, the situation at the beginning of the pandemic was far from ideal. Many
students and teachers were not equipped with the necessary digital readiness or the internet
bandwidth to connect to these online platforms. Nonetheless, they rose to the occasion and
gradually adjusted to the new normal in education.

Schools and Universities in KSA
Beginning the 2020-2021 academic school year, the Saudi Ministry of Education
launched a national Digital Teaching Platform (DTP) called Madrasati (meaning my school).
The purpose was to provide a unified platform for delivering online instruction to over six
million students in Saudi public schools, from first to twelfth grade (Oraif & Elyas, 2021). With
the initiation of the new school year, educators began to recover learning that was missed during
the pandemic and continued to cover new learning material. Middle- and high-school students
attended classes online during reserved morning hours, whereas elementary school students
attended classes in the afternoon. These efforts ensured that each level had an allotted learning
time and reduced the internet traffic congestion caused by too many users at a time. The
afternoon hours preserved for elementary school students also allowed parents to assist their
young children in attending their online classes and support their learning (Oraif & Elyas, 2021).
On the other hand, Saudi universities were naturally better prepared to transition to the
online learning environment, as most Saudi universities had already implemented digital
communication and learning tools. For example, university students are set up with an official
email account as soon as they enroll; therefore, university students’ communication with their
institutions was not interrupted. Also, most Saudi universities utilized Blackboard®, a Learning
Management System (LMS) designed to deliver both synchronous and asynchronous modes of
learning. However, this software was not used extensively and served a supplementary role prior
to the pandemic, and its e-learning users are still discovering its features.
E-Learning of English in KSA
In discussing technology use to deliver educational material, many terms are widely used,
such as e-learning, online learning, electronic learning, digital learning, and technologyenhanced learning. These terms are all used to describe “a set of technology-mediated methods
that can be applied to support student learning and include elements of assessment, tutoring,
and instruction” (Wheeler, 2012, p. 1109). In other words, the primary and only method of
delivering educational content and instruction is through digital and online tools. This could
either be synchronous (i.e., teaching occurs live with students and instructors both present online
in real-time) or asynchronous (i.e., the content and instruction are available for the students to
access any time via recordings of the lessons or independent online activities).
Many previous studies have investigated the effectiveness of implementing technology in
EFL learning in KSA universities. However, these studies approached technological tools as
supplementary to face-to-face instruction in a method called blended learning, which is defined
as “any formal education program in which a student learns at least in part through online
learning” (Maxwell, 2016, para. 3). That is, only part of the instructions occurs online,
whereas the rest occurs in person. This method has shown positive results in learning
English in KSA. For example, Alsowayegh et al. (2019) at King Abdulaziz University found
that using online activities (i.e., watching videos related to the lesson and participating in
discussion forums) in addition to in-person instruction improved university EFL learners’
listening and speaking skills. Other studies surveying university EFL students’ perceptions of
employing the blended learning model in their English acquisition show positive attitudes
towards this method (Al-Jarf, 2007; Alowedi, 2020; Bukhari & Basaffar, 2019; Gulnaz et al.,
2019).

Nevertheless, these studies only consider technology’s role as a supplement to face-toface instruction, not as a replacement which is the case during the pandemic. The blended
learning model differs from the e-learning model in that the former offers some in-person
instruction, whereas the latter occurs entirely online, making the results incomparable and should
be discussed separately.
Challenges in the Online Teaching of English During the Pandemic
Issues in English language teaching (ELT) have existed long before the COVID-19
pandemic. Though, existing problems only exacerbated with the sudden shift to online learning
and the adjustments entailed. One of the most prominent concerns discussed in ELT is language
learners’ motivation to learn (Al-Hoorie, 2017). Language educators in the Saudi context have
widely observed the lack of student motivation (Elyas & Al-Grigri, 2014), likely caused by
students’ low proficiency (AlMaiman, 2005), but also subject to alternative factors (MacIntyre,
2002). Previous literature suggests that online learning environments are more engaging and
conducive to increasing learner motivation (Kim & Frick, 2011). However, distance learning is
also “sensitive to situational conditions” (Hartnett et al., 2011, p. 20), influenced by external
factors, such as time constraints, grades, and the students’ learning environment. The pandemic
further compounds these issues. In fact, a recent survey of over one thousand academic English
instructors in 99 countries revealed that student motivation during the pandemic was among the
respondents’ top concerns (Wright, 2021).
A study conducted by ur Rahman (2020) surveying fifty English language instructors
across the kingdom about their perceptions of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic
reported that 68% of the respondents believed that students are less motivated to learn online.
This lack of motivation is not necessarily due to the online learning environment itself. Other
literature cites the significant causes for student demotivation during the pandemic are
respectively: being socially isolated, having a weak internet connection, enduring distractions at
home, and not being able to achieve class objectives (Hernández & Flórez, 2020). As almost all
KSA schooling has moved online, students are obliged to attend school from their homes where
they feel disconnected from their peers or distracted by siblings and other family members who
are also learning or working remotely. Only those who need to attend practical training or
laboratories continue to participate in face-to-face learning.
An additional reason for students’ demotivation could be due to mental health issues,
given that motivation and anxiety are highly correlated (MacIntyre, 2002). Studies revealed that
many Saudis suffered from some level of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder
due to the pandemic, especially in its initial phase (AlKhamees et al., 2020; Joseph et al., 2020).
Learning during the COVID-19 pandemic can be very stressful on students due to the sudden
changes surrounding them and anxiety over the disease itself (Elsalem et al., 2020; Ghazi-Saidi
et al., 2020). As a result, students may suffer psychological distress caused by the fear of halting
their academic progress (Hasan & Bao, 2020). Although students and educators have managed to
carry on with the educational process, they are doing so in less-than-optimal conditions and
numerous barriers to overcome, all of which could affect motivation.
Digital readiness is another issue put forth by the pandemic of 2020. Digital readiness
can be defined as “the degree to which people succeed or struggle when they use technology to

try to navigate their environments, solve problems, and make decisions” (Horrigan, 2016, p.2).
The switch to remote learning took the world by surprise and left many students and educators
unprepared for the new tasks they had to take on. Al-Nofaie (2020) carried out a Blackboard
readiness survey with 25 students majoring in the English language department at Taif
University. The findings indicate students’ lack of digital readiness and technology skills. The
author also mentions instructing her students on how to download PDF files and write notes on
them, which demonstrates the need to support students during difficult times. Indeed, in many
cases, English language instructors have had to take on a technical support specialist’s role,
teaching students, among other things, how to download, upload, and share their work.
Especially when working with language learners, those with lower English proficiency levels
may face additional difficulties accessing digital technology, as most of the technology is
available in English (Sugarman & Lazarin, 2020).
Furthermore, the availability of appropriate technology and reliable internet connection
(on both the students’ and teachers’ end) is the only way students can access educational content
and online courses. Therefore, internet connectivity and bandwidth influence learners’ online
experiences significantly, seeing that their learning experiences are dependent on the reliability
of their internet connection (Al-Nofaie, 2020). Qualitative interviews conducted by Bin
Dahmash (2020) with 12 EFL university students at King Saud University revealed that students
faced technical problems while attending their classes on Blackboard, from incompatible
devices, sound interruption to being logged out by the platform. These issues increased at certain
times in the day with increased internet traffic accessing the platform simultaneously. Likewise,
Mabrook’s (2020) survey of 20 EFL learners at Onaiza colleges found that 64.3% of the
respondents indicated that they faced “repeated disconnections,” interfering with their learning
and online exams. These interruptions caused by slow or weak internet connection affect the
quality of the online learning experience. They may also negatively impact learning, as they
could lead to student frustration and demotivation (Hashim et al., 2018).
Additionally, there is the issue of poor technical support. Due to a multitude of students
and faculty needing support at any given time, students do not receive help when they need it
(Ali & Abdalgane, 2020). Besides, students with disabilities face accessibility issues and lack the
required support they received while attending their educational institutions in person. For
example, those with visual impairments will have trouble seeing the digital whiteboard, reading
material that the instructor posts, or participating in the classroom chat. They need access to
voice-to-text software, which still does not support all digital platforms and file formats.
Similarly, students with hearing loss do not always have access to closed captioning or subtitles
of the oral or video lectures. These accessibility issues for students with special needs leave them
excluded and prevent them from taking full advantage of online learning (Madhesh, 2021).
It is worth mentioning here that in KSA’s general education, one of the most impressive
achievements by the Saudi Ministry of Education was creating 23 educational television
channels called iEn for those who do not have access to the internet. These channels include
interpretations using Saudi sign language for students who are hearing impaired. They have also
created three channels for special education students with learning disabilities. These
instructional accommodations help mitigate some of the accessibility concerns of distance
learning for children with special needs. Yet, similar services are deficient at the university level.

On the other hand, lack of visual input during online learning is a significant challenge
for EFL learners. Due to cultural constraints and respecting users’ privacy, turning on cameras
and visibly appearing in the virtual classroom is not required of students and instructors,
especially at the tertiary level. However, ELT theory and evidence argue for the importance of
non-verbal input and facial gestures in language learners’ development. Visual cues are crucial
for communicating critical information that conveys the overall meaning of the verbal message
(Gregersen & MacIntyre, 2017). Thus, the listener’s loss of the speaker’s visual input in an
online language lesson is a disadvantage to EFL students. For that reason, many studies of online
learning during the pandemic suggest the preference for face-to-face communication with peers
and instructors in the Saudi EFL context (Al-Jarf, 2020; Al-Nofaie, 2020). In fact, participants in
Dahmash’s (2020) qualitative focus groups mentioned that they preferred in-person classes due
to “the absence of the eye contact between themselves and the instructor” (p. 228).
Assessments are also another challenge with ELT being carried out remotely for various
reasons. First, many language instructors face the issue that there is no guarantee that what the
students are submitting is their original work. Despite the availability of anti-cheating software
and plagiarism tools, not all instructors are adequately trained to apply them, or students bypass
them by using various academic dishonesty methods.
Ali and Abdagane (2020) noted that one of the obstacles faced in the online teaching of
English is the “ease of penetration of the content of the test” (p.12). They mention several
methods to reduce cheating, such as using a plagiarism checker to check the students’ written
answers, paraphrasing the content of objective type questions, displaying single questions in
random order, and reducing the allotted time for the test. Nevertheless, without being physically
present or applying surveillance software (which would violate students’ privacy), there is no
guarantee that the student is completing the assessment on his/her own. It also makes it more
troublesome to evaluate students’ learning progress. For example, Mabrook (2020) found that
students used a second device during exams to search for answers online or simply copy and
paste responses from other sources. Due to these issues in evaluating students, remote
assessments do not depict students’ development accurately.
Moreover, online learning and teaching are more time-consuming than in-person classes,
creating yet another challenge. In a survey of academic English teachers worldwide, Wright
(2021) showed that only 10% of English language teachers spent most of their teaching time
online before the pandemic. Now, however, 55% of the teachers surveyed spend 100% of their
teaching time online. In addition to teaching online, language instructors also prepare content,
create materials, send and reply to emails, post assignments for students, and correct students’
work online, to name a few. As a result, language teachers spend between 10 to 12 hours in front
of a screen daily (Hernandez & Florez, 2020). Similarly, in Mabrook’s (2020) survey of Saudi
EFL university students, 85.7% claimed it takes them more time to prepare for online lectures
than it does for in-person classes. It is also disconcerting because, as Shaibani (2020) suggests,
the longer time spent online, especially using mobile devices, was highly correlated with
academic procrastination and social media addiction. Furthermore, long hours of screen time and
online communication cause many users to feel exhausted and drained from what has come to be
known as Zoom Fatigue (Wiederhold, 2020).

There are also issues with learning platforms. In addition to Blackboard LMS, students
and instructors have utilized alternative applications and software, yet they come with privacy
and security issues. One of those is WhatsApp, a mobile application that allows its users to send
text messages, photos, videos, voice notes, and even make calls with family and friends for free
via the internet. A study by Alabasi and Alghamdi (2019) reported that WhatsApp is one of the
most widely used applications by university EFL students who perceive the application as
helping them learn reading, writing, and grammar. However, many privacy concerns have
surrounded the application because of how users’ data is being used and shared. Recently, due to
an update in January 2021 by WhatsApp’s owner company, Facebook, requiring users to share
even more of their and contact information, most universities directed faculty and staff to switch
over to Signal-a similar functioning app that offers more protection of data (Tashkandi, 2021).
The videoconferencing application, Zoom, faced similar concerns. Before the COVID-19
pandemic, hardly anyone had used Zoom for teaching, but as soon as schools went virtual,
almost everyone was using it at first. Zoom offers various compelling features for teachers, such
as live audio and video chat, a digital whiteboard, screen sharing, and uploading instructional
materials. University students also found it helpful. Alfadda and Mahdi (2021) found a positive
correlation between Saudi EFL university students’ use of Zoom and their acceptance and
perceived usefulness of the technology. Nevertheless, security vulnerabilities were discovered
after a series of Zoombombings, in which an individual attends “a Zoom session who has not
been invited, with the potential for overt disruption” (Fudge & Williams, 2020, p. 197). Another
problem was Deepfakes, which is “the imposition of someone else’s face on a different person’s
body in video format using Artificial Intelligence algorithms” (p.197). As a result, most Saudi
universities warned their faculty against using Zoom for teaching and web conferencing and
requested that they replace it with a more secure alternative, such as Blackboard LMS, even
though it does not offer all the same convenient features.
The Positive Outcomes of Online Teaching During COVID-19
Despite the drawbacks of the online instruction of English, many positive aspects have
surfaced. One of the most significant advantages is the flexibility that online learning affords.
Remote learning offers flexibility for students and teachers to attend classes anywhere and
anytime (if learning asynchronously). It even provides versatility in the type of devices and
software used by students and instructors. Aljaber’s (2021) investigation of Saudi university
students revealed that they are most likely to use their mobile phones in e-learning environments,
making it easier to access their lessons and learning materials. The author also maintained that
virtual learning environments allow “students the freedom to study and finish the coursework
anytime, anywhere” (p.138). For example, Mabrook (2020) points out that EFL students attended
while at work, in the car, while seated with family, or from the comfort of their bed, even though
this is not necessarily desirable. This flexibility has also saved students the time they spent
commuting to and from their university campuses (Al-Jarf, 2020; Bin Dahmash, 2020).
Surprisingly, even instructors stranded across borders—due to quarantine mandates and air travel
lockdown—could teach from different countries, sometimes numerous time zones apart
(Yandell, 2020). Thus, online learning during the pandemic has removed the physical constraints
of space and time while paving the way for a new learning approach that transcends these
barriers.

One of the other benefits observed as a result of the switch to the online instruction of
English is that students who were too shy to speak up in front of a large class might be more
willing to speak in front of a screen from the comfort of their home. For instance, Khafaga’s
(2021) survey of 311 EFL university students from five major Saudi universities revealed that
attending classes via Blackboard (instead of in-person) helped learners overcome their shyness in
participating in class discussions. Similarly, online language learning has been claimed to boost
introverted students’ confidence in class (Hakim, 2020) and promote peer interaction (Al-Nofaie,
2020). The (partial) anonymity afforded by e-learning provides a safe space that contributes to
reducing students’ anxiety around speaking a foreign language.
The switch to online instruction has also accelerated the development of new skills in
both language students and their instructors, seeing as the sudden shift has forced many to tread
on uncharted territories. Among the new skills implemented by English language teachers for the
first time since the pandemic are: teaching online, delivering presentations online, providing
online practice for students, using electronic versions of coursebooks, and carrying out online
assessments (Wright, 2021). Likewise, the virtual learning environment helped improve EFL
students’ language skills, especially in listening and speaking (Khafaga, 2020; Hernandez &
Florez, 2020) and their online searching skills (Bin Dahmash, 2020). Despite the difficulty many
faced in adapting to online environments, the new experiences spurred novel skills acquisition
and honed existing expertise.
Along the same lines, the move to digital learning has resulted in the incidental learning
(i.e., learning without the intention of learning) of English which occurs through exposure to the
language informally. Because English is the most common language used online, with 25.9% of
online content being in English (Statista, 2020), EFL learners encounter more English outside
their language lessons than they would in a face-to-face classroom. Also, Alqarni (2020) argues
that Saudi EFL learners’ use of the internet promotes their informal acquisition of the language
because students have access to content that piques their interests, such as music, movies,
YouTube videos, and videogames. Hence, online learning may prove to be beneficial for
students’ informal learning of English.
Furthermore, the need for novel skills for online teaching and learning created a universal
need for professional development opportunities. With the surge of COVID-19 cases and the
increased quarantine restrictions, there was a boom in online training and educational material.
The result was universal access to a wealth of knowledge through online webinars, conferences,
courses, and workshops—primarily free of charge (Shin & Borup, 2020). It has never before
been this convenient to attend educational and training events in different places, without being
limited to choosing only one. Saudi universities all participated in these events and provided
access to university affiliates and non-affiliates alike. Additionally, many professors, educators,
libraries, and even publishers offered free access to their materials to ensure that while the whole
world comes to a standstill, education does not.
Discussion
This paper reviewed and synthesized over 40 recently published research concerning the
online teaching of English as a foreign language in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the
COVID-19 pandemic by highlighting the challenges and benefits discussed in the literature. The

current research on how distance learning influences EFL learning and teaching at the tertiary
level implies several vital points. First, learners’ motivation is at risk. Although e-learning
benefits students who struggle with shyness or foreign language learning anxiety by promoting
their classroom interaction, many students lack the motivation to attend classes or participate in
online activities. Part of this lack of motivation could also be due to complications students face
with internet connectivity that affect the quality of lesson delivery. The other reason could be
that the students are attending lessons in less-than-optimal learning environments.
Remote learning has allowed students to join their virtual classrooms wherever they may
be. However, the flexibility of distance learning is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it
removed the physical limitations of space and time, providing access to learning and
development opportunities worldwide and saved the time it takes to commute to and from
university campuses. On the other hand, it also allows for more distraction from learning. The
home environment is replete with disruptions, especially with other family members working
and learning from home. Furthermore, the absence of separation between home and school
environments makes it harder for students to distinguish between leisure time and learning time.
The switch to online learning also highlighted several other issues that hinder students’
progress. One of the problems that surfaced is insufficient digital readiness skills in students and,
sometimes, teachers, which is further compounded by the shortage of technical support. The
various advantageous features of e-learning become inaccessible when its users cannot access
and use them. Additionally, dealing with such issues and navigating online territories is timeconsuming for both learners and instructors.
Mainly related to language development, students need to have visual input of the spoken
language. Not activating the use of video features during the lesson may undermine the
development of their speaking and listening skills. Alternatively, students’ vocabulary and
research skills may improve due to the incidental learning that occurs while accessing the
internet with all its English content. Nevertheless, assessing the development of these language
skills online has proven to be a predicament that requires teachers to take extra precautions to
help assure its validity.
Conclusion
In conclusion, educators and stakeholders must consider the issues mentioned above
when examining the efficacy of e-learning in EFL and evaluating its usefulness and application
after the pandemic finally comes to an end. Future research in this area should investigate the
discrepancy in learner motivation between those who are more inclined to join in peer
discussions online and those who feel less motivated to participate when classes are online. Also,
there is a need for larger-scale studies to measure the academic EFL learning outcomes at the
university level in Saudi Arabia.
