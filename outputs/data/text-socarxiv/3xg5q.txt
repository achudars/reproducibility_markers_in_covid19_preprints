Abstract
Lower-income neighborhoods have higher numbers of COVID-19 infections than higherincome neighborhoods. Yet we know relatively little about why these neighborhoods are more
vulnerable. Using neighborhood-specific COVID-19 data recently released by the City of
Toronto, we (a) compare the COVID-19 trajectories in lower- and higher-income neighborhoods
and (b) examine the extent to which neighborhoods’ physical infrastructure and sociodemographic composition account for this difference. Until early March, differences in the
cumulative number of COVID-19 infections by neighborhood SES were minimal. However,
COVID-19 has since spread faster in lower-income neighborhoods. Until the peak of the
pandemic, the physical infrastructure of lower-income neighborhoods was the key reason why
COVID-19 spread faster in these neighborhoods. After the peak, differences in physical
infrastructure played a smaller role. Lower-income neighborhoods had greater difficulty curbing
the pandemic because higher shares of their residents belong to groups particularly vulnerable to
COVID-19. Our findings illustrate how the pandemic may exacerbate inequalities across
neighborhoods.

1. Introduction
The health, social, and financial costs of the COVID-19 pandemic have not been shared
equally across populations and neighborhoods. Recent studies show that in many countries,
COVID-19 infection and death rates are higher among residents of lower-income neighborhoods
than their peers living in more affluent neighborhoods (Borjas 2020; Choi et al. 2020). In many
ways, this disparity is not surprising. Residents of lower-income neighborhoods report generally
poorer health outcomes (Boylan & Robert 2017; Diez-Roux 2001; Pickett & Pearl 2001;
Sampson 2003), and they are more likely to have pre-existing health conditions, which render
them more vulnerable to COVID-19 infections and deaths (NAS 2017; Tai et al. 2020).
Furthermore, relative to those living in higher-income neighborhoods, higher shares of residents
in lower-income neighborhoods work in front-line occupations with greater exposure to the virus
(Rho et al. 2020).
Physical infrastructure of neighborhoods may also contribute to the differential risks of
contracting COVID-19 among their residents (Choi et al. 2020; Rocklov & Sjodin 2020). Lowerincome neighborhoods are more densely populated, making it more difficult for residents to
effectively practice physical distancing (Rocklov & Sjodin, 2020). Furthermore, residents of
lower-income neighborhoods frequently lack close access to essential goods and services, such
as primary health care facilities and grocery stores, which means that they need to travel longer
distances and risk greater exposure to the COVID-19 virus (Abercrombie et al., 2007; Hilmers,
Hilmers, & Dave, 2012). Partially reflecting the socio-demographic composition of their
clientele, facilities tied to COVID-19 hotspots (e.g., long-term care facilities) are
disproportionately located in lower-income neighborhoods (NAS, 2019).

However, to our knowledge, there has been no systematic examination of how the
physical infrastructure and socio-demographic composition of neighborhoods have contributed
to the differences in COVID-19 trajectories by neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES). To
address this gap, we estimate growth curve models to (a) compare the COVID-19 infection
trajectories of lower- and higher-income neighborhoods in Toronto and (b) assess the extent to
which the socio-demographic composition and physical infrastructure of neighborhoods
contribute to these differences by neighborhood SES. Our analyses rely on neighborhood-level
data recently released by the City of Toronto.1
We contribute important insights to the research describing inequalities in the spread of
COVID-19. We determine the characteristics of lower-income neighborhoods that make them
more vulnerable to COVID-19 than higher-income neighborhoods. More specifically, we
consider whether and how neighborhoods’ physical amenities mitigate (or exacerbate) the spread
of the COVID-19 virus. Our findings can inform public health policies that distribute amenities
and services and that aim to reduce health disparities across neighborhoods. Our study also
focuses on COVID-19 trajectories, in contrast with most prior work on the neighborhood-level
social determinants of COVID-19 that focuses on cumulative counts at a single point in time
(Borjas 2020; Choi et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2020).

In Canada, COVID-19 data is tallied for provinces or health regions. Health regions, which are

nested within provinces, are responsible for the health care of 415,000 residents. In early June,
the City of Toronto unveiled COVID-19 data tallied for finer-grained geographic regions (CBC,
2020).

1.1 Toronto – the setting for our study
Toronto is well-suited for a study on the neighborhood risk factors of COVID-19 for
several reasons. It is one of Canada’s COVID-19 epicenters, with especially high infection and
mortality rates (The Star, 2020). Toronto, which is the largest city in Canada, has many residents
who belong to populations vulnerable to COVID-19, such as Black residents and immigrants
(Statistics Canada, 2013). It is comprised of 140 official neighborhoods with an average
population size of 19,511 residents. These socially meaningful neighborhoods vary significantly
with respect to their socio-demographic composition, presence of physical amenities, and
COVID-19 infection rates (Yang et al., 2020). Toronto is among the first local governments in
Canada to release COVID-19 data with information about patients’ neighborhood of residence
(CBC, 2020) and data about neighborhood amenities.
2. Data and Methods
2.1. Data
We merge (a) neighborhood-specific COVID-19 data released by Toronto Public Health,
(b) data on the socio-demographic composition and availability of physical amenities obtained
from the City of Toronto’s Open Data Portal, and (c) data about the accessibility of
neighborhoods obtained from Walk Scores®.2
Neighborhood-specific COVID-19 data includes information about the number of
COVID-19 infections reported for each neighborhood in the City of Toronto between Jan 21,
2020, and July 10, 2020. It also includes information about each individual case’s severity:
whether the patient was intubated, hospitalized, admitted to an intensive care unit, or died.

From the City of Toronto’s Open Data Portal, we compile information about the sociodemographic composition and availability of physical amenities for each neighborhood.
Neighborhood-level socio-demographic composition was estimated by the City of Toronto using
the 2016 Canadian Census. We also use data from Walk Score® to rate the walkability of
neighborhoods. This measure captures how easily residents can access amenities in their
neighborhoods, their ability to effectively practice physical distancing, and how well the physical
infrastructure of their neighborhoods might mitigate their exposure to the COVID-19 virus. Walk
Scores® are computed for specific latitude/longitude coordinates. We account for withinneighborhood variation in walkability by computing the mean score for 10 randomly sampled
locations in each neighborhood.
2.2.Measurements
Our outcome variables are the cumulative number of COVID-19 infections and the
cumulative count of severe COVID-19 infections. Infections are deemed ‘severe’ if the patient
was intubated, hospitalized in an intensive care unit, or died. We present results obtained from
COVID-19 counts instead of rates because government agencies and the media have focused on
counts. We also ran the analyses using rates as our outcomes, and the results are similar.
Our independent variable is neighborhood SES. The City of Toronto reports the
percentage of residents with household incomes below the low-income cut-off (LICO) point,
which is the poverty line defined by Statistics Canada. Neighborhoods are classified as lowerincome if the percentage of their residents with household incomes below LICO is above the 67th
percentile (i.e., 19.1% or higher) and higher-income if this share falls at or below the 67th
percentile. We obtained robust estimates when we used alternate cut-off points: 50th and 75th
percentiles.

4

We capture the availability of physical amenities in a neighborhood through the inclusion
of Walk Scores®, population density, the presence of a transportation hub (yes vs. no), the
presence of a community health center or larger hospital (yes vs. no), the presence of a longterm care facility (yes vs. no), and the percentage of a neighborhood devoted to green space. We
capture the socio-demographic composition of neighborhoods with the percent Black residents,
percent foreign-born, percent of immigrants without proficiency in English/French, percent of
residents aged 65 years and older, percent of residents who are essential workers, and percent of
residents whose commute to work is at least 60 minutes. All continuous variables were
standardized to account for differences in their distribution. We considered several other
dimensions of neighborhoods’ physical infrastructure and socio-demographic composition but
ran into convergence and multicollinearity issues (VIF>10; see Sections A.1 and Table A1 in the
Online Appendix for more details).
2.3. Analytical strategy
We compare the COVID-19 infection trajectories of lower- and higher-income
neighborhoods. For these analyses, we relied on weekly cumulative overall and severe counts of
COVID-19 infections. We estimate two-level growth curve models to assess how the physical
infrastructure and socio-demographic composition of neighborhoods contribute to the variation
in COVID-19 trajectories by neighborhood SES. These models compute the differences in the
cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in lower- and higher-income neighborhoods at the
beginning of the pandemic and the rate at which cases increase over time. We focus on three
time periods: (a) early March (the beginning of the pandemic in Toronto), (b) mid-April (the
peak), and (c) late-May (the period right after the peak when policymakers started to discuss the

5

reopening of the economy).3 We selected these points in time based on the trajectory of COVID19 infection rates in Toronto (see Figure 1), but our results are robust to alternate time periods.
We fit three additive growth curve models. Model 1 includes neighborhood SES,
dichotomous variables for the three time points, and the interactions between the two. Model 2
adds neighborhood amenities to Model 1. Model 3 adds socio-demographic composition to
Model 2. We use population means and the coefficients from each model to compute the
predicted number of cumulative COVID-19 cases in lower- and higher-income neighborhoods
for each time point. We determine how differential access to physical amenities contributes to
disparities in COVID-19 trajectories by comparing the results from Models 1 and 2. We assess
how variation in socio-demographic composition contributes to disparities in COVID-19
trajectories (independent of physical amenities) by comparing the results from Models 2 and 3.
3. Results
3.1.Variation in the availability of physical amenities and socio-demographic composition by
neighborhood SES
Table 1 shows that lower-income neighborhoods are more likely than higher-income
neighborhoods to have medical facilities, such as community health centers and long-term care
facilities, located in them. They generally have fewer transit hubs than higher-income
neighborhoods. Lower-income neighborhoods are also more densely populated, making it harder
for its residents to physically distance. Relative to higher-income neighborhoods, they are also
more demographically diverse, and higher shares of their residents belong to groups identified to
be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. Higher shares of residents of lower-income
neighborhoods are also essential workers. Higher shares of their residents must travel at least 60

minutes to get to work, potentially increasing their exposure to the virus, reflecting the fact that
lower-income neighborhoods tend to be in the periphery of the city.
Table 1 goes here.
3.2.Variation in COVID-19 trajectories by neighborhood SES
Figure 1 shows how the trajectories in COVID-19 infections compare between Toronto’s
lower- and higher-income neighborhoods. Until early March, there were virtually no differences
in the number of COVID-19 cases by neighborhood SES; however, between mid-March and
mid-May, the number of new COVID-19 cases in lower-income neighborhoods increased at a
much faster pace. After mid-May, the number of new COVID-19 cases in lower-income
neighborhoods started to converge with that in higher-income neighborhoods, and by mid-June,
differences in number of new COVID-19 cases by neighborhood SES are minimal.
Figure 1 goes here.
Figure 2 reveals that trajectories of severe COVID-19 infections in lower- and higherincome neighborhoods appear to diverge about two weeks earlier than the emergence of the gap
in total infections. The trajectories of severe COVID-19 cases by neighborhood SES diverge in
early March. The disparity reaches its peak in early April and lasts for a longer period than the
peak for total cases, extending through early May. Disparities by neighborhood SES may emerge
earlier for severe cases than for cases overall for several reasons. For example, due to unmet
health care needs, residents of lower-income neighborhoods tend to have poorer health and more
pre-existing health conditions than residents of higher-income neighborhoods (NAS, 2019).
Having a pre-existing condition is associated with a higher risk of developing a severe COVID19 infection (Wiemers et al., 2020). The earlier divergence may also be the result of differential
testing. Residents of lower-income neighborhoods were less likely than their counterparts in

7

more affluent neighborhoods to get tested during the early stages of the pandemic (Borjas, 2020;
Ferguson, 2020). Given the high proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers who do not get
tested, looking at trajectories of severe cases may provide a clearer picture of the heightened
vulnerability of lower-income neighborhoods.
Figure 2 goes here.
3.3. Explaining differences in the trajectories of COVID-19 cases by neighborhood SES
Figure 3 presents the results from three additive growth curve models predicting
differences in the cumulative number of COVID-19 infections between lower- and higherincome neighborhoods during the pandemic as well as differences in their trajectories. Full
results are available in the Online Appendix Table A2. Panel A in Figure 3 shows the predicted
cumulative number of COVID-19 infections from a baseline model with neighborhood SES,
time period, and their interaction. These results are consistent with our descriptive findings. In
early March, differences in COVID-19 cases were fairly small. Although the cumulative number
of COVID-19 increased rapidly across all neighborhoods between early-March and mid-May,
the number of overall cases in lower-income neighborhoods increased at a much faster rate than
in higher-income neighborhoods. On average, 18 more COVID-19 cases were reported in lowerincome neighborhoods in the lead-up to the pandemic’s peak in Toronto (between early-March
and mid-April), and this gap widened to 46 after the peak (between mid-April and mid-May).
Figure 3 goes here.
Panel B presents the results from Model 2 and shows how the availability of physical
amenities helps to explain these differences. The greater presence of community health centers
and larger hospitals contributed to the faster spread of COVID-19 in lower-income
neighborhoods. Because lower-income neighborhoods in Toronto are often “primary care

8

deserts”, residents of these neighborhoods frequently meet their health care needs in community
health centers, which have limited resources and administer care to large numbers of patients
(Yang et al., 2020). These centers may themselves be high risk places, or the presence of
community health centers may serve as a proxy for the higher share of residents in a
neighborhood with unmet health needs, poorer health, and higher vulnerability to COVID-19.
Higher population density contributed to the faster spread of COVID-19 in lower-income
communities as well. Adjusting for differences in neighborhoods’ physical infrastructure
reduces the difference in new COVID-19 cases between early March to mid-April by half and
(18−9)

renders this difference statistically insignificant (

18

= .5). After the peak (i.e., between mid-

April and mid-May), these controls explain roughly a third (

(46−32)
46

≈ .3) of the gap. These

differences, however, remain statistically significant.
Disparities in socio-demographic composition also contribute to the faster pace of spread
of COVID-19 in poorer neighborhoods (Panel C). COVID-19 spread faster in lower-income
neighborhoods partially because higher shares of its residents are Black and foreign-born –
groups who have been particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic (Choi et al., 2020;
Borjas 2020). Once we control for socio-demographics, COVID-19 no longer spreads at a faster
rate in lower-income neighborhoods. All the coefficients capturing differences in the rate of
increase are statistically insignificant.
3.4 Explaining differences in the trajectories of severe COVID-19 cases by neighborhood SES
Figure 4 illustrates the results of a similar set of analyses focusing on the trajectories of
severe COVID-19 infections (full results are available in Table A3 of the Online Appendix).
Results from these models are comparable to those above, with two notable differences. First, the
cumulative number of severe COVID-19 cases grew faster in neighborhoods with long-term care
9

facilities, partially reflecting the fact a significant portion of COVID-19 deaths in Ontario
occurred in these facilities (CIHI, 2020). Second, the cumulative number of severe cases grew
faster in neighborhoods with more green space. This pattern may emerge because young
residents may have congregated in neighborhood parks as temperatures rose to escape their
crowded apartments (Global News, 2020). The congregation may have resulted in outbreaks
among these residents. Because young adults tend to be asymptomatic (Davies et al. 2020), they
may have not known that they had a COVID-19 infection unless their case was severe.
Figure 4 goes here.
4. Conclusion and discussion
Using detailed data recently released by the City of Toronto, we compared the trajectories of
COVID-19 cases in lower- and higher-income neighborhoods. Our neighborhood-level
assessment of COVID-19 represents a marked improvement in the level of geographic
granularity over existing analyses on the unequal impact of COVID-19 in Canada and elsewhere.
Until early March, differences in the number of COVID-19 infections by neighborhood SES
were small. After this point, however, COVID-19 began to spread faster in lower-income
neighborhoods. In the period leading to the peak, the widening gap between lower- and higherincome neighborhoods is largely due to the varying constellation of physical amenities present in
these areas. Specifically, controlling for differential availability of physical amenities, such as
availability of community health centers and higher population density, explains about half of the
disparities in rate of increase between early March and mid-April and this difference is longer
statistically significant. After the peak, differential availability of physical amenities played a
smaller role. It appears that lower-income neighborhoods had greater difficulty curbing the
pandemic in large part due to variation in sociodemographic composition across neighborhoods.

10

Controlling for differences in the physical infrastructure explains only a third of the difference in
the rate of increase of COVID-19 between mid-April and mid-May. However, once we add
socio-demographic controls, this difference is no longer statistically significant. In conclusion,
our findings underscore the importance of designing policies aimed at a more even distribution
of physical amenities across neighborhoods and decreasing socio-demographic segregation to
reduce the vulnerability of global cities to pandemics.

Online Appendix
A.1. More detailed representations of our models
The Call for Papers requires a succinct presentation of the data and methods, about which
we elaborate here. We predict two-level growth curve models predicting differences in the
cumulative counts of COVID-19 in lower- and higher-income neighborhoods at the beginning of
the pandemic and the subsequent rate of increase. The level-1 equation in our growth curve
models describes within-neighborhood (i) changes in cumulative COVID-19 infection counts
over time (t), and can be represented as follows:
𝑦𝑖𝑡 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛽𝑖 𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡
COVID-19 infection trajectories (𝑦𝑖𝑡 ) are characterized by a unique intercept and a timedependent slope (𝛽𝑖 ). Time (t) is added as a series of dichotomous variables indicating the weeks
when the cumulative counts were computed to capture the non-linearity of COVID-19’s
spread—namely, in early March, mid-April, and mid-May.
The level-2 equation captures variation in the cumulative counts of COVID-19 across
lower- and higher-income neighborhoods. Formally, the level-2 equation can be expressed as
follows:
𝛼𝑖 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1 𝑥𝑖1 + 𝛼2 𝑥𝑖2 + ⋯ + 𝛼𝑘 𝑥𝑖𝑘 + 𝑢𝑖

(2)

𝛽𝑖 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑥𝑖1 + 𝛽2 𝑥𝑖2 + ⋯ + 𝛽𝑘 𝑥𝑖𝑘 + 𝑣𝑖

(3)

In Equations 2 and 3, the random intercepts (𝛼𝑖 ) and slopes (𝛽𝑖 ) are a function of time-invariant
covariates (𝑥𝑖𝑘 ) and error terms (𝑢𝑖𝑡 , 𝑣𝑖𝑡 ).

A1.2. Detailed List of Neighborhood Amenities and Socio-demographic Composition of
Neighborhoods
It is also worth noting that in earlier versions of the paper, we tried to include Transit
Scores and Grocery Scores (defined similarly as Walk Scores), the percentage of a
neighborhood’s area devoted to commercial space, the number of bars, the availability of a
shopping center, the presence of a prison, and the presence of COVID-19 testing site. However,
the inclusion of these measures resulted in multicollinearity (VIF>10). We also considered the
percentage of adults aged 20-39, percentage of visible minorities and ethnic minorities,
percentage of immigrants who were not proficient in English or French, percentage of college
graduates, percentage of adults working in agriculture, percentage of adults whose commuting
time exceeds 30 or 60 minutes, and percentage of adults who rely on public transportation to
commute. Again, the inclusion of these measures resulted in convergence issues or
multicollinearity (VIF>10). We contend that our rich set of controls measuring a neighborhood’s
physical infrastructure, accessibility, and available amenities as well as socio-demographic
composition helps us understand why certain neighborhoods may be more vulnerable to the
pandemic.
A1.3. Spatial Autocorrelation
The virus is not contained within neighborhood boundaries. We tested for spatial
autocorrelation in the spread of COVID-19 across neighborhoods in Toronto by calculating the
global measure of spatial autocorrelation (Moran’s I) for the cumulative number of infections for
each of the three time periods: 0.10 in early March, 0.08 in mid-April, and 0.32 in mid-May.
While statistically significant (p<.05), these values suggest fairly low levels of spatial
autocorrelation. Local indicators of spatial association (LISA) indicate a particular cluster of

20

neighborhoods with high numbers of COVID-19 infections in the northwestern part of the city
(where there is also a cluster of lower-income neighborhoods), and few clusters elsewhere (see
Figure A4). For severe COVID-19 infections, spatial autocorrelation is lower (0.09-0.13) and
decreases over the three periods. This likely reflects at least two dynamics: (1) there are fewer
severe cases overall, and (2) individuals with severe infections are more likely to be physically
isolated in their homes or in hospitals as they recover, thereby reducing the spread within and
outside of their neighborhoods. Together, these results suggest that there is a small possibility
that we may be overstating the impact of neighborhood amenities and socio-demographic
composition of neighborhoods on differences in the spread of COVID-19 between lower-income
and higher-income neighborhoods. Specifically, the higher COVID-19 counts in Northwest
Toronto may be the product of the physical amenities and socio-demographic traits of residents
in the neighborhood itself and surrounding neighborhoods. Future studies examining the spread
of COVID-19 in neighborhoods should make greater efforts to adjust for the spatial
autocorrelation of models.

Table A4. LISA cluster map for neighborhoods in Toronto

Notes: Maps show Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) of all and severe COVID-19 cases by neighborhood and time period. “Low-high”
neighborhoods (in blue) are those with low COVID-19 counts, surrounded by neighborhoods with high counts. “High-high” neighborhoods (in red) are those that
have high counts themselves and are surrounded by other neighborhoods with high counts. Neighborhoods with statistically non-significant LISA (p>.10) are in
white. Lower-income neighborhoods are outlined in black.
