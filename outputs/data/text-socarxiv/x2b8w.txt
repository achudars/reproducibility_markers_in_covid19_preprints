Abstract
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is impacting health globally, whereas older
adults are highly susceptible and more likely to have adverse health outcomes. In
Bangladesh, the elderly population has been increasing over the past few decades, who
often live with poor socioeconomic conditions and inadequate access to healthcare
services. These disparities are likely to increase amid COVID-19, which may result in high
mortality and morbidity among Bangladeshi older adults. We recommend that
multifaceted interventions should be adopted for strengthening social care and health
systems approach to ensure wellbeing, promote preventive measures, and facilitate access
to healthcare among older adults in Bangladesh. Such multipronged measures would
require policy-level commitment and collaborative efforts of health and social care
providers and institutions to protect health and wellbeing among this vulnerable
population during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Geriatric health in Bangladesh during COVID-19

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a major global health concern, especially
for older adults who share a major proportion of mortality and morbidity in this
pandemic (World Health Organization, 2020a). COVID-19 imposes unique challenges
to low- and middle-income countries (Mazumder, Hossain, & Das, 2020), leaving
Bangladesh with no exception. It is the eighth-most populous country in the world, with
more than 162 million population (World Health Organization, 2020b). In 2016, the life
expectancy of Bangladeshi males and females became 71 and 74 years, respectively
(World Health Organization, 2020b), which is much higher than a national average of
46.5 years in 1971 when the country got independence (The World Bank, 2019). This
can be attributable to notable success in terms of reducing child and maternal mortality,
infectious diseases, and malnutrition in the past 49 years, which is also known as
Bangladesh Paradox (Hossain, Sultana, & Munzur-E-Murshid, 2018). However, despite
a significant improvement in the overall population health and increased life
expectancy, geriatric health problems are still under-recognized in Bangladesh
(Barikdar, Ahmed, & Lasker, 2016). In this article, we describe unique challenges for
Bangladeshi older adults during COVID-19 and discuss potential strategies addressing
the same.
In the sociocultural context of Bangladesh, older adults are generally dependent on their
family members, which limits the autonomy and abilities for decision-making regarding
their own health (Ellickson, 1988). This critically affects their health and quality of living.
During COVID-19, socioeconomic challenges like unemployment and poverty are
increasing in Bangladesh (The World Bank, 2020), which is impacting the householders
as well as older adults living with their families. Moreover, in the absence of an organized
and universal social care program, Bangladeshi older adults continue to experience the
indirect socioeconomic burden of COVID-19.
Another critical challenge is the high burden of noncommunicable diseases among older
adults in Bangladesh (Mazumder, Murshid, Faizah, & Hossain, 2020; Taskin, Biswas,
Siddiquee, Islam, & Alam, 2014). As the health outcomes of COVID-19 is poorer among
people with preexisting conditions (World Health Organization, 2020a), Bangladeshi
older adults remain highly vulnerable to adverse health outcomes in this pandemic.

Furthermore, as the country is experiencing community transmission of COVID-19 (UN
News, 2020), community-dwelling older adults are highly susceptible to the infection and
associated mortality.
Lastly, older adults in Bangladesh may lack mobility and access to care amid COVID-19.
As the nation has no home-based care program for older adults, seeking institutional
services remain the only option for someone who is experiencing any kind of health
problems. Moreover, nationwide travel restrictions and limited availability of
transportations during this pandemic have made it difficult to access healthcare centers
that are located mainly in the urban areas, whereas more than sixty-three percent of the
population lives in rural areas of Bangladesh (The World Bank, 2016). In addition, many
of the tertiary care centers are transforms into COVID-19 hospitals, where access to
regular care services has become limited (Dhaka Tribune, 2020). Therefore, older adults
in Bangladesh are less likely to receive timely and appropriate care for COVID-19 and
other health problems.
These challenges highlight some of the major challenges that Bangladeshi older adults are
experiencing amid COVID-19. Many of those can be explained by evaluating the
preexisting health disparities for older people, whereas some of them are aggravating as
COVID-19 has impacted socioeconomic conditions and health systems. As more people
are approaching to elderhood as well as increased susceptibility to COVID-19, these
challenges should be considered for effective policymaking ensuring better health and
social care for older adults in Bangladesh. We propose the following recommendations
for strengthening geriatric care during COVID-19 in Bangladesh:
1. Introducing a comprehensive health and social care program for older adults who
are dependent on their families or have no sources of income
2. Strengthening existing social care programs that directly or indirectly support
older adults based on the special challenges during COVID-19
3. Mobilizing community resources like religious institutions and voluntary
organizations to improve social care and rapid response to affected or vulnerable
older adults during COVID-19

4. Launching mass media programs like radio shows, television programs, and online
events promoting education and awareness on geriatric wellbeing, self-care, and
preventive measures for COVID-19
5. Initiating telemedicine services and remote health consultations for older adults
6. Educating and empowering informal caregivers to older adults to promote
preventive practices and improve access to health services for older adults
7. Strengthening public health surveillance for COVID-19 among older adults with
enhancing diagnostic capacities for this population
8. Improving collaborations among community health centers and advanced care
facilities for effective referral and clinical care
9. Providing dedicated ambulance services for transporting suspected or diagnosed
cases of COVID-19 to the nearest healthcare organization
10. Prioritizing geriatric care in health and social policymaking for COVID-19 to
ensure policy-level resources and support for measures adopted by the community
and institutional stakeholders
Geriatric health problems are highly prevalent in Bangladesh, whereas institutional and
social capacities to address the same remain limited (Bilkis, 2020; Mazumder, Murshid,
et al., 2020; Taskin et al., 2014). During the COVID-19 pandemic, these gaps may
increase manifolds and result in high mortality and morbidity among older adults who
are highly susceptible to infection and less likely to receive adequate care. To maintain
the population health gains through preventive measures in the past decades, the
policymakers and other key stakeholders must address the geriatric care needs amid the
COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, health and social care providers and institutions may
play vital roles in policy advocacy and service delivery, promoting geriatric care during
COVID-19. Bangladesh has a long history of effective public health measures despite
socioeconomic challenges, which should be reinforced in decision-making processes to
protect the health of the Bangladeshi older adults in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.
