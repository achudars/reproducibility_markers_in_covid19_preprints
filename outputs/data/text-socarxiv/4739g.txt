Reducing the Risks of New Coronavirus in Vulnerable Areas in Brazil
Abstract
The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has not yet reached its peak1 of infections in Brazil2. Yet it
has already caused significant disruptions to the life of people across the country. The higher
rate of confirmed cases and deaths have so far been concentrated in urban areas. However, it
is only a matter of weeks for this lethal virus to reach remote and poor areas in the rural part of
the country. When this happens, it will wreak havoc. This paper thus proposes a policy deriving
from a risk assessment for local leaders from these areas. The expectation is that this strategy
designed for impoverished and deprived areas can contribute to reduce the risk of the
horrendous effects that this pathogen can have in these vulnerable communities and their
fragile economies.
Keywords: new coronavirus, public policy, Brazil, vulnerability, poverty
Background
The current public health crisis caused by the new coronavirus poses catastrophic risks3 to
remote (‘rural’) and/or poor4 municipalities and communities (‘areas’) in Brazil5. Such areas have
been largely ignored6 by central authorities at this stage of this unprecedented global crisis. The

federal and state governments have been more concerned about reducing the rates of
community transmission in large urban areas7 since they have reported the first cases for
COVID-19. The good news is that many remote and/or poor8 areas have not yet reported official
cases of the new coronavirus. The bad news is that intra and/or interstate movement of people
is still happening9. Thus it is only a matter of time for the first official cases to occur and
exponentially increase. And once they start, it might be too late for these impoverished and
deprived areas to avoid significant human and economic losses. These areas will also be
unable10 to reverse these losses in the short and medium terms. This article, therefore, aims to
provide a feasible action plan that elected officials and community leaders from remote and poor
areas can immediately take to contain the spread of new coronavirus while keeping to a
minimum social and economic disruptions within their areas during this pandemic. The policy
proposed in this article is called 'Island Resizing'.
Proposed Policy
'Island Resizing' argues for a shift in mindset11 among decision makers. Local leaders are urged
to physically disconnect12 from medium and large urban areas. They need to quickly plan their
communities to become 'islands' in their region for as long13 as this global crisis lasts. And after

isolating themselves, they need to be ready to quickly adapt14, or 'resize'15 their areas, to the risk
of community transmission by creating islands within islands through delineating inner
'boundaries'16 to isolate suspected cases. 'Island Resizing', therefore, is a policy strategy guiding
local decision makers on how they can protect their vulnerable17 residents with minimum
resources. It is a flexible method that permits impoverished and deprived areas to quickly adapt
to moving targets. It is an ongoing methodology that proposes the establishment of temporary
'boundaries', or 'cordon sanitaire'18, that start from outer city limits and could trickle down to
smaller units such as nursing homes. The main assumption of this strategy is that local leaders
are committed to protect the most vulnerable residents and have the means to quickly establish
and enforce different sizes of these 'boundaries' for as long as it is required.
Method
The factor determining the extension of and where these 'boundaries' are to be delineated
depends on the risk level of each municipality or community to the new coronavirus.
If local leaders deem that the area or many residents fall into the category of high-risk to this
disease, a 'boundary' around the most vulnerable should be immediately established.
However, if there is no sign that this disease has reached a high-risk municipality or community
yet, local decision makers need to quickly consider establishing a 'boundary' around the city or
community limits. Outer 'boundaries' must allow only essential19 services and goods

to be brought in. This is to keep the rapid20 spread of this virus at bay while minimizing21 the risk
of disruptions to existing social and economic activities.
These 'boundaries' need to be in place for the entire duration of this pandemic. However,
'boundaries' around smaller units such as nursing homes can be gradually dispersed22 after
residents within that boundary have not presented symptoms to COVID-19 after a three-week23
quarantine. These vulnerable residents are then encouraged24 to return home. However, they
are strongly advised to keep strict hygiene standards and maintain recommended social
distance25 either at home or in public. Such precautionary measures aim to reduce the risk of
vulnerable residents to be in contact with people unknown to be infected and showing no
symptoms but still transmissible26 to those in close contact with them.

Medium-risk areas are those featuring:
. evidence of community transmission in the region
. recent influx of travellers from community transmission areas
. few number of vulnerable residents
Actions:
. establish a boundary around the city and allow only the entry of essential goods and services
. establish boundaries around small units such as nursing homes and local medical centers
Low-risk areas are those featuring:
. no evidence of community transmission in the region
. no travellers from community transmission areas over the last three weeks
Action:
. establish a boundary around the city and allow only the entry of essential goods and services
Limitations
There are important limitations to the proposed policy. The first one is how local leaders can
accurately determine the risk level of their area due to lack of accurate34 official data. The
assessment of this risk level is essential as it determines ​when​ and ​where​ 'boundaries' should
be established and gradually dispersed. The second limitation is the enforcement35 of these
boundaries. Local authorities must warn about upcoming36 lockdowns. They also need to be
aware that the longer these ‘boundaries’ are in place, the more resources they will need to
ensure outsiders and insiders do not not break through the blockade. The third limitation has to

do with the psychological toll37 that such boundaries impose on isolated communities inside and
outside these areas. The longer they are imposed, the greater the risks are for social unrest.
Conclusion
Despite these limitations, this paper argues that such actions should be considered by local
leaders from remote and poor areas to contain38 the spread of new coronavirus within their
communities. This is because the risk posed by the new coronavirus to vulnerable groups living
in impoverished and deprived areas is significantly higher than the one observed in urban
places with resources to enact interventions39 to contain community transmission and to mitigate
the rate of hospitalizations. Testing40 and hospitalization are not a reality for remote and/or poor
areas, so local leaders requested41 some guidance42 on what they can actively start doing to
protect the most vulnerable individuals and their local economy in this moment of great
uncertainty. Finally, 'Island Resizing', as a policy strategy, is not an assurance that remote and
poor areas will come away from this global crisis unscathed. The main motivation in proposing
such a policy is to help local leaders reduce43 the risks of community transmission within
impoverished and deprived areas while protecting their most vulnerable residents and limiting
losses to the local economy.
