Vulnerable groups at increased risk of COVID-19 in sub-Saharan
Africa: The case of the HIV population

The COVID-19 disease is spreading quickly around the globe. As the COVID-19 outbreak
advances, governments are warning individuals at high risk to strictly follow restrictions to
control the outbreak. To date, most information about the risk factors of the COVID-19 comes
from China, South Korea, and Europe. Since the first outbreaks in China, more than 50
thousand individuals died.1 Deaths are highest in Italy, Spain, China, France, and in the US.1
Individuals above age 60 are at higher risk of dying if infected with the novel coronavirus.2,3 In
Italy, the country that registered nearly one-fourth of the deaths worldwide, 90% of the deaths
were above age 70, and 10% above age 90. Also, individuals with diabetes, cardiovascular and
respiratory diseases, and cancer are at greater risk of death by COVID-19.3,4
More recently, the COVID-19 disease is advancing fast towards different settings. Regions with
a high burden of infectious diseases such as HIV, malaria, and dengue including Latin America
and Africa are experiencing an increasing number of confirmed cases and deaths. Since the age
structure and the distribution of relevant co-morbidities vary substantially by country, the risk
profile for COVID-19 could be very different in some low income settings from that observed to
date in China, South Korea and Europe.5,6
Here, I want to draw attention to potential differences in the risk profile for COVID-19 in high
HIV prevalence settings. Most people living with HIV are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa,
where the first death by COVID-19 was registered on the 19th of March.6 Since no country
currently experiencing more advanced stages of the COVID-19 outbreak has a high prevalence
of HIV, it is still unknown if the risk profile for COVID-19 derived from high-income settings
will be similar in other regions such as sub-Saharan Africa.

In 2017, an estimated 36.8 million individuals were living with HIV in the globe, which makes
this a major global public health issue.7 Despite the advancements in antiretroviral therapy,
nearly a million of individuals died by HIV in 2017.7 Most HIV deaths are due to co-infections
with other diseases including tuberculosis and hepatitis C.8 Also, individuals living with HIV
are at increased risk of developing a range of noncommunicable diseases such as hypertension
and cardiovascular disease.8 HIV-infected individuals are also at greater risk of dying related
to influenza.9 This risk decreased for those who are on antiretroviral therapy, but it does not
disappear. These are reasons that make the HIV population a potentially vulnerable group at
increased risk of COVID-19.
Figure 1 shows the age distribution of the people living with HIV in different settings. Young
adults (20–49 years) comprise most of the HIV population. Despite this similarity across countries, differences in population size are striking. In South Africa nearly 5.2 million individuals
are living with HIV between ages 20 and 49, a number that is 50 times higher than the HIVinfected population of Italy, 8 times higher than that of Brazil, and 3 times higher than that of
Mozambique.
There is no evidence as yet that people infected by HIV are at higher risk for severe illness or
death from COVID-19. However, they are not immune to get infected by the novel coronavirus.
Information from countries that have been testing both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals such as South Korea and Iceland revealed that the age distribution of those infected by
the novel coronavirus is similar to that of the total population.10,11 If the same is true in other
settings, one can expect a massive number of infections at young and adult ages in low-income
countries, which raises the relevance of the underlying co-morbidities among young adults.
In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV is the leading cause of morbidity at young and adult ages. More
than 20% of individuals between age 15 and 49 are living with HIV in South Africa, Lesotho, and
Botswana, and more than 10% in Mozambique and Namibia.8 This highlights the impact the
COVID-19 outbreak may have in sub-Saharan African populations. A large number of deaths
by COVID-19 at young and adult ages may occur as a consequence of the greater vulnerability
of the young population in some sub-Saharan Africa countries compared to that of high-income
settings.
Governments should be aware that differences in the distribution of co-morbidities by country
can result in an increasing demand for hospitalization, and deaths by COVID-19 among young
adults. In high HIV prevalence settings, particular attention should be given to young indi-
