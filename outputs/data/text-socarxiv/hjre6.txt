Abstract. During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of people had to work from home. We examine the ways in which COVID-19 affect
organizational communication by analyzing five months of calendar and messaging metadata from a technology company. We found that: (i) cross-level communication increased more than that of same-level, (ii) while within-team messaging
increased considerably, meetings stayed the same, (iii) off-hours messaging became much more frequent, and that this effect was stronger for women; (iv) employees respond to non-managers faster than managers; finally, (v) the number
of short meetings increased while long meetings decreased. These findings contribute to theories on organizational communication, remote work, management,
and flexibility stigma. Besides, this study exemplifies a strategy to measure organizational health using an objective (not self-report based) method. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study using workplace communication
metadata to examine the heterogeneous effects of mandatory remote work.

Introduction

The rapidly evolving COVID-19 crisis challenged millions of employees all around the
world to start working from home (WFH) almost overnight, unprepared. More than one
third of the U.S. workforce that used to commute before March 2020 were sent to their
homes to WFH until a further notice [1]. Accordingly, employers have been actively
looking for WFH policies which promote effective WFH and limit the impact of the
pandemic. In order to do this, they first need to identify how WFH affect their employees’ communication and collaboration behavior. Without knowing it, millions of employees’ health and organizations’ productivity are at great risk. Because, now the
workforce has to deal not only with the traditional stressors of WFH, but also with the
pandemic, which might be the most extreme global stressor of our generation [2].
After shortly experiencing WFH during COVID-19, many big tech firms including
Facebook and Twitter announced that they are transitioning into being “remote-first”

2
[3]. Research not only shows how disasters and pandemics have immediate effects on
organizational behavior [4–6], but it also identified how early responses to chaotic
events centuries ago effect companies’ behaviors even today [7]. Accordingly, all employers need to identify the most effective WFH policies for their companies urgently.

Hypothesis Development

When employees don’t work in business as usual (BAU) settings but are forced to WFH
–due to disasters or pandemics– they have to compensate for the lost opportunity of
face-to-face (f2f) communication. While some of these communications happen in
planned meetings, others happen impromptu. Although there is a high variation in the
findings of prior studies on the amount of scheduled meetings [8] and unscheduled f2f
communication [9, 10], they report that at least 25% of work time is spent for scheduled
meetings and another 25% for unscheduled communication during normal times. After
transitioning to WFH, we can assume for regular planned meetings would continue in
a virtual setting. The fate of the unplanned f2f communication is more complicated
when it comes to WFH.
Communications for coordinating social activities such as having a meal or drink
together is no longer relevant and hence cease during WFH. Others move to available
computer mediated communication channels such as virtual meetings (e.g. Zoom),
email, and workplace messaging apps (WMA) such as Slack and Microsoft Teams.
During WFH we expect (H1) much of the unplanned f2f communication to move to
WMA. Our rationale is that many functions of WMA are similar to f2f (and if not better).
In the sense, it allows for: (i) negotiating availability which gives more control to recipient and solves the convenience asymmetry problem of f2f interruptions while (ii)
maintaining social connections and conversational context (e.g., emojis and persistent
chat history); (iii) furthermore, quick questions and clarifications via instant messaging
is faster than dialing in, and, (iv) WMA allows for context-rich interactions by utilizing
topic-based groups and message-threads as well as (v) coordination and scheduling –
with dyadic/multi-party direct messages and integrated apps/bots [10, 11].
Despite the many benefits of WMA, Nardi et al. [11] observed that employees switch
media when the matter discussed is complicated, when there is a misunderstanding, or
when communicating information requires too much typing. In this regard, media richness theory [12] suggests that complex information is better transmitted in rich channels
where it is easier to ask questions, interrupt, interpret cues, and give feedback. Accordingly, we expect (H2) employees to setup extra (short) meetings when WFH.
Often, organizations are divided into divisions and further into teams. The members
of a team depend upon and communicate among each other more than others. Therefore, (H3) we expect messaging and meeting dyads within teams to increase more than
those of cross-teams. Besides, research on the effects of reorganization on tie decay
suggests that employees are more likely to choose to retain ties to valuable contacts,
reciprocated ties, and socially embedded ties [13], and we assume that employees are
embedded in their teams and have higher reciprocity with their team members.

3
Supervisors should support their employees because it has been found that supervisor support is positively related to job satisfaction [14], in particular when employees
are WFH [15]. Another benefit of greater leader-member information exchange is that
subordinates then show more helping behavior to their coworkers [16]. From a Machiavellian perspective, managers are among the most valuable contacts with whom to
retain ties [13]. Therefore, we expect that (H4) cross-level messaging increases more
than that of same-level when WFH becomes mandatory.
Teleworking provides flexibility and autonomy, and this has been shown to be
highly appreciated by employees WFH during disasters and pandemics, e.g., [4, 6]. Due
to the closures of facilities and schools, family role demands and interference with work
greatly increased in the early months of COVID-19. Thus, work has become more fragmented and sporadic throughout the day. Therefore, we expect (H5) employees to work
more and communicate more outside regular business hours. Furthermore, it has been
shown that household labor is not shared equally in most families. Working mothers
assume a much greater responsibility for household management and child adjustment
(~22h vs ~10h per week for fathers) [17]. In another study the majority of working
mothers with dependent children at home reported that “they alone assumed responsibility for household routines involving organizing schedules for the family and maintaining order in the home” [18]. Since many schools and childcare facilities were closed
during the early months of the pandemic, and women often take on more household
and childcare responsibilities during the day, their work might be more sporadic than
that of men. Besides, women are more likely to suffer from the stigma against flexible
workers [19], and therefore we expect (H6) women to be more willing to signal that
they are working in the after-hours as an attempt to prevent that discrimination.
Work telepressure, the urge to respond to asynchronous work messages quickly, is
found to be associated with the amount of work performed at home [20]. Since employees are WFH all of the time during COVID-19, (H7) we expect greater level of telepressure and hence quicker message turnaround, (H8) especially those who used to share
the same office and had the opportunity to communicate f2f. Besides, researchers have
noted a flexibility stigma by managers against those who WFH every day as not being
as productive or as committed to those who come to the workplace [19]. In order to
overcome the stigma while WFH, we expect (H9) employees to respond to messages of
their managers even quicker.
Turning to meetings, we expect that (H10) employees reduce long meetings when
WFH. Our rationale for this is that too many meetings or communication may cause
difficulties for employees to find time to focus and do the actual work. Furthermore, it
has been found that employees become annoyed when they are interrupted by meetings
(rather than informal f2f interruptions) [21]. Besides, interruptions by chat messages
has been shown to be much less disruptive than f2f because the recipient has more
control over the situation, the norms are different –social costs associated with not responding in f2f is much higher, and the recipient can peek a message to get a sense of
its urgency to decide when to respond –such plausible deniability is not possible in f2f
or calls [11]. Also, meetings being too lengthy is one of the top reported meeting problems [8]; and, attending virtual meetings for a long period is worse than that of physical
meetings –aka Zoom fatigue [22, 23].

Methodology and Data

This study exploits metadata (no content) emitted from commonplace workplace
technologies such as calendar, and workplace messaging apps collected from a tech
company starting from 2020-01-06 to 2020-05-31. The company has two main offices,
one (N=26) is located in the Eastern Time Zone (ET), and the other (N=9) is in the
Pacific Time Zone (PT). The PT office transitioned to WFH on 2020-03-09 and the ET
office on 2020-03-16. Chats (WMA) and meetings (calendar events) before and after
these dates are designated as pre (BAU) and post (WFH) –the company does not use
email for internal communication practically, therefore, we excluded it in this analysis.
From the company’s calendar system, we collected time, duration, and attendees list
of every event setup; and from their WMA, we collected time, sender, and receivers list
of every message sent during the entire period. Besides the communication metadata,
we obtained the following participant demographics: office location, primary-team and
division, is-manager, tenure, and gender. In extracting metadata, all of the personal
identifiers were hashed on the client’s servers. From this communication metadata, we
created 21 weekly snapshots of meeting and messaging networks and analyzed them.
Each event contributes to a directed weighted network through a concept called “attention time” [24]. An event generates one or more directed weighted links that can be
represented as a 3-tuple of (attention giver, attention receiver, attention minutes). For
example, when A sends a message to B, then the tie (A, B, estimated message writing
time) is created but no tie is created from B to A. When A sends a message to N recipients, a tie is created between A and each recipient (i.e., N ties in total), each with a
weight of “estimated message writing time” divided to N. We estimated message writing time rather than using pure message counts in this analysis because people have
different styles of using these systems. Especially in instant messaging, employee A
might prefer “hitting enter” more often and creating a separate message event for each
sentence (or even for each word!), while employee B might choose sending less messages with longer content. When a person sends multiple messages quickly one after
another, we cap the writing time of the subsequent messages by the previous messagesent, otherwise we cap message writing time at 5 minutes based on self-reported WMA
usage data. When calculating response times, we only considered messages explicitly
responding a particular message in threads.
For meetings we do not have a sender-receiver concept (unlike messages), they only
have co-attendees, therefore attention is considered bi-directional. When A has a 30
minute one-on-one meeting with participant B, both ties of (A,B,30) and (B,A,30) are
created; similarly, a 30 minute meeting of three participants (A,B,C) creates six links
(the six permutations of a three-element set) each with 15 minute weights (attention
times) – namely, (A,B,15), (A,C,15), (B,A,15), (B,C,15), (C,A,15), (C,B,15).

Results

We hypothesized in H1 that people who previously had the opportunity to communicate
f2f would message each other more while WFH. To operationalize H1, we compare the

5
increase in messaging among employees who previously shared the same office to those
did not. As a baseline, during BAU, we observed that 80.5 % of communication happened within the office. After transitioning to WFH, as seen in Table 1, the increase in
WMA within the same office coworkers is much greater than between different offices.
While the WMA increase for the same office is statistically significant (p<0.001), it is
not the case for between different offices. These findings support H1.

We expected that after transitioning to WFH, the number of short meetings would increase (H2) while the number of long meetings would decrease (H10). In Table 1 we
see that the overall time spent in meetings increased. Regarding meeting lengths, our
first observation is that most of the meetings were already short in the pre (BAU) condition, and there were only a few long meetings per person-week. But despite that, in
the WFH situation we still see an increase in the short meetings and decrease in long
meetings (the change is evident in the ratio column of Table 2). Therefore, we find
strong evidence in favor of H2 and H10.

Turning to H3, we hypothesized that both messaging and meeting within teams would
increase more than that of between teams. In BAU, we observe that most (67.7 %) of
the messaging happens within teams. After transitioning to WFH, there is a greater
increase in same-team communication compared to other-team as shown in Table 3.
These findings support the messaging part of H3. However, number of meetings stays
nearly the same within teams while it increases more than one hour per person-week
across teams. This can be explained by the post-COVID employee engagement policies
of the company such as happy hours, (more frequent) town halls, and leadership office
hours into which everyone was invited and encouraged to join.

With respect to H4, we hypothesized that cross-level messaging and meeting increases
more than same-level communication during WFH. Through our analysis we found the
increase in messaging to be higher among cross level communication (31.69 %), and
lower for same level communication (10.91 %). These findings support the first half of
H4. We also hypothesized that an average manager increases their meetings with nonmanagers more than they increase their meetings with other managers. Similarly, we
expected an average non-manager to increase their meetings with managers more than
they would increase their meetings with other non-managers. The results are shown in
Table 4. During BAU, we see that most of the meetings were among managers (an
average manager spends ~3 hours/week meeting with other managers). This continues
in WFH. However, managers started to have more meetings with non-managers so
much so that an average manager’s meeting time surpasses all other categories (by
jumping from 110 minutes/week to 187 minutes/week). Just as managers increased
their meetings with non-managers more than they did with other managers (69.76% >
29.31%), non-mangers increased their meetings with managers more than they did with
other non-managers (18.91% > 11.62%). These findings support the latter half of H4.

We hypothesized that off-hours asynchronous communication is greater when WFH
than during BAU (H5), and that this increase is greater for women (H6). To explore
this, we calculated the number of WMA chat minutes outside normal business hours
(9am-5pm employee’s local time) for each workday. Table 5 shows the results of this
analysis. Specifically, women had about the same amount of chat in BAU to men, but
this was tripled when WFH, while for men chat only doubled. These findings support
hypotheses H5 and H6.

We hypothesized that employees respond to their peers’ messages faster when WFH
(H7) and that this effect is stronger for same office workers (H8) and for managers
(H9). To operationalize these hypotheses, for each reply message, we calculated message response time (delta). We included responses sent within 8 hours of original message and excluded others. Overall, we found that the median response time dropped by
18.65%, supporting H7. However, when we break it down, we see that while employees’ response speed to same office workers increased by 23.45 %, their responses to
other office workers slowed down by 16.88 % (Table 6). Median response time from
non-managers to managers were not faster than that of between non-managers, so we
did not find any evidence in favor of H9.

Conclusion

F2f communication offer values that are not available in mediated communication, and
lack of it brings risks. Beyond offering a richer medium for information exchange, sharing a common space provides opportunities for sustaining social relationships (through
touching, eating/drinking, and informal interactions) which is a precondition for effective communication. It eases communication by allowing referencing to items, using
pronouns, and using physical items in collaboration, and learning (by observing and
maybe even subconsciously) [21, 25]. When WFH however, out of sight, out of mind
attitude might win over, and hence information undersupply, role ambiguity ,social isolation, disengagement, job dissatisfaction, and stress might increase [26]. Most of the
hypotheses tested in this paper are adaptations to prevent such complications.
Employee stress is negatively associated with organizational financial success, team
productivity, and employee engagement [27]. To mitigate their effects, employers try

8
to identify work stressors (i.e. conditions causing stress in their organization). Identification of work stressors has traditionally been through surveys; however, Oz [28] argued that digital trails of commonplace workplace technologies can be exploited for
this purpose and that this strategy has many advantages over the self-report based
method. In this study, we extend that strategy to show the impact of COVID-19 on
work practices using data collected from a technology company before and after it transitioned to WFH. This study contributes to the literature in several unique ways.
First, what we know of work practices during the COVID-19 is very limited despite
more than one third of the U.S. workforce transitioned to WFH during the pandemic
[1] –and many believe that WFH is here to stay [5]. Yet, empirical studies on the topic
is very rare [4, 6, 29, 30]. Accordingly, our first contribution is providing insights on a
phenomenon that has become very prevalent but very less known.
Second contribution of this study is that it employs ICT (information and communication technologies) data while most prior studies were self-report based, and therefore
suffer from well-known survey issues such as selectivity biases, response biases, and
item-characteristic biases [31]. The only other work that uses ICT metadata for analyzing the effect of mandatory WFH is [29]. Although that study is sound from an external
validity perspective, their data is at metropolitan area level and did not give itself in to
analyze any heterogeneity effect of WFH on communication patterns. Therefore, their
data did not give in much room for theory development and hypothesis testing.
Third, the surveys in the aforementioned studies were all conducted after employees
transitioned to m-WFH. For example, even though the respondents were asked to selfassess their wellbeing for four weeks prior to beginning m-WFH in [6], their responses
might suffer from memory weaknesses, transient mood effects, and other biases. However, that is not the case with ICT data: it gives itself in for retrospective data collection,
and thus solve the unobservability problem [32].
Fourth, most prior survey-based studies measure higher level constructs. For example, [6] examines responses to “My team is continuing to have regular meetings” and
“My team is avoiding synchronous communication”. Similarly, [4] ask questions such
as “WFH lead to loss of professional/social interaction” and “WFH enabled me to have
more time for myself/my family”. We argue, by using atomic enacted events as constructs, one can learn more on the extent of such behaviors. Thus, this approach can
help solve some of the paradoxes in the telework literature [33, 34].
Fifth, we develop hypotheses based on communication theories, in particular the
theories of mediated communication [25] and telework [26]. Thus, this study is not a
“theory free” big data analysis [35], but a “theory centric” computational social science
study [36]. In this regard, this study is unlike the articles merely reporting statistics on
the change of ICT use during COVID-19 and lack theoretical discussions [29, 37, 38].
