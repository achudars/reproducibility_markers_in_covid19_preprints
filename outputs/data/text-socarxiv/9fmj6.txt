ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND
Traditionally, during crises the number of new blood donors increases. However, the current
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created additional barriers to donate due to
governmental prevention measures and increased personal health risks. In this report, we
examined how the pandemic affected new donor registrations in the Netherlands, especially
among groups with higher risk profiles for severe COVID-19. Additionally, we explored the
role of media for blood donation and new donor registrations.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS
We analyzed new donor registrations and attention for blood donation in newspapers and
on social media from January until May 2020, in comparison to the same period in 2017 to
2019.
RESULTS
After the introduction of nationwide prevention measures, several peaks in new donor
registrations occurred, which coincided with peaks in media attention. Interestingly, people
with a higher risk profile for COVID-19 (e.g. due to age or region of residence) were
overrepresented among new registrants.
DISCUSSION
In sum, the first peak of the current pandemic has led to increased new blood donor
registrations, despite the associated increased health risks. Time and future studies will have
to tell whether these new donors are one-off ‘pandemic’ donors or if they will become
regular, loyal donors.

INTRODUCTION
At the moment, an unprecedented situation is occurring all over the globe – the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To prevent further spreading of the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), governments around the world have
urged their citizens to stay at home, limit their social contacts, and keep to physical
distancing. Due to the large health, social, and economic impact of the preventive measures,
the pandemic is a ruling topic in (inter)national newspapers, magazines, on social media [1],
television, scientific preprints and articles (with already over 90,000 hits in PubMed when
searching for articles about SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19), in government communications, and
almost all personal and professional communication.
Previous research has shown that crises not only negatively impact societies, but also
make people rise up to the occasion and contribute to public goods. For instance, national
emergencies have repeatedly encouraged blood donation as a symbol of national solidarity,
leading to higher numbers of new blood donors (e.g., 9/11 in the United States [2, 3],
bushfires in Australia [4]). Based on this, one might expect higher numbers of new donors
during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, however, the current COVID-19
pandemic poses a risk for individuals wanting to donate blood, as donating is impossible
within the bounds of physical distancing. Thus, the costs of donating for individuals are
increased in terms of health risks, which may be a barrier for donors. Indeed, several
countries had faced drops in their numbers of donors and donations in the early weeks of
the pandemic [5-7]. In China and Iran for example, blood donors initially cancelled their
appointments or did not show up at collection sites because of increased worry to acquire
SARS-CoV-2 [6, 7]. Such reactions are in line with previous findings from SARS and avian flu
outbreaks that showed that fear of infection deters donors [8, 9]. Individual health risk might

4

play a particularly salient role for vulnerable groups [10, 11], such as older donors or donors
from regions more affected by COVID-19.
Consequently, blood collection agencies made appeals, emphasizing the need for
blood and the safety of the procedure, which creates awareness and may mitigate the
barriers (potential) donors could experience by altering perceptions of fear about risks
associated to donating during a pandemic. Increasingly, these appeals to donate blood and
the more general discussions around blood donation take place online [12] and might
increase motivations to (continue to) donate blood.
Taken together, it is unclear whether the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in
terms of new blood donor registrations may show a rise similar to earlier emergencies, or a
decline because of the increase in health risks this particular crisis holds for the individual
donor. In this report, we examine how the current pandemic affects new donor registrations
in the Netherlands. In addition, we study whether certain demographic groups and
individuals with higher risk profiles for severe COVID-19 are over- or underrepresented in
their contribution to the blood supply during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we explore
whether new donor registrations are associated with peaks in media attention for blood
donation and Sanquin, the Dutch blood supply organization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data and procedures
In the Netherlands, the blood supply is organized by one collection agency (Sanquin)
which yearly collects whole blood and plasma of approximately 330,000 non-remunerated
donors at 49 fixed and 87 mobile sites throughout the country. Due to the outbreak of the
pandemic, Sanquin implemented several measures to ensure the safety of its donors and
staff. For instance, an additional triage was established for donors entering the blood

5

collection center to check whether they (or someone in their household) had experienced
COVID-related symptoms in the past 14 days. Soon after, this “Corona check” also became
available for donors online. To adhere to physical distancing guidelines (1.5 meters), less
collection beds were available and opening hours were extended locally and temporarily to
accommodate as many donors as possible. Sanquin informed its donors about these
measures via a special page and pop-up on its website and via social media messages. New
donors may also have come into contact with this information when they registered via the
website.
After the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands, Sanquin started to
periodically test samples of blood donations on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to
check for immunity. This was widely discussed in the news, as were Sanquin’s efforts to
contribute to PCR testing (for the presence of the virus) for healthcare professionals and to
collect convalescent plasma from donors that recovered from COVID-19 within very strict
study protocols (in collaboration with university medical centers) for developing medicine(s)
for COVID-19 patients. During this first period of the pandemic, PCR testing was not yet
available for the majority of the Netherlands, and thus most people with mild symptoms
were not tested. For more information about the blood supply and appeals to donors during
the first two months of the COVID-19 outbreak in the Netherlands, see Langi Sasongko and
colleagues [13].
To retrieve information on new donor registrations, we exported data from the blood
bank information system (eProgesa software application; MAK-SYSTEM). This large-scale
register contains demographic information on all Dutch whole blood and plasma donors and
individual donation behavior, such as registrations, and donations (attempts); including
information on the date, time, and location of each donation attempt. From this database,

6

we extracted new donor registrations for the period between the first week of 2020 (well
before the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the Netherlands in week 8) and week 20 (when
several virus control measures were [about to be] relaxed). We compared the registration
dynamics in 2020 with those in the same period in 2017, 2018, and 2019.
Timeline and measures
We created timelines aggregated on weekly level, reflecting new donor registrations and
Sanquin’s media appearance in newspapers and on different social media channels. These
timelines also display the official number of infections reported by the Dutch government
[14] as well as the imposition of the infection prevention measures by the Dutch government
[15, 16]. New donor registrations were counted as all potential donors who registered to
become a blood donor during the study periods (i.e. week 1-20 in 2017, 2018, 2019, and
2020). During the same time periods, we also collected all Dutch regional and national
newspaper articles mentioning Sanquin (available from the Lexis-Nexis Uni database) and
social media messages about Sanquin as well as blood donation more generally. These social
media data were collected through Coosto (www.coosto.nl), which has an extensive social
media database. We limited our social media data collection to public posts in Dutch on the
three largest social media platforms on which Sanquin is most active: Facebook, Instagram,
and Twitter. See Appendix S1 for a complete overview of procedures used to obtain relevant
newspaper articles and social media posts.
Additionally, we report sex, age group (≤24 years, 25-39 years, 40-54 years and ≥55
years) and province of residence for all newly registered donors (extracted from the Dutch
blood donor database).
Data analysis

7

Descriptive statistics are presented for all newly registered donors, using means (M)
and standard deviations (SD). To test for differences between groups of donors, we used
analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous and chi square (χ2) tests for categorical
dependent variables.
RESULTS
Donor registrations
While in the first eight weeks of the year there were more new donor registrations in
2018 and 2019 compared to 2020, this changed after week 10 (cf. Fig 1). After the first
infections with SARS-CoV-2 were officially reported in the Netherlands in week 9, the first
nationwide infection prevention measures were imposed by the Dutch government (e.g.,
physical distancing, working from home as much as possible, closing of schools, bars,
restaurants, and sports facilities) in week 11. In the same week, Sanquin announced that
donors were needed because blood stocks were shrinking. Since then the amount of newly
registered donors increased, with peaks in week 13 (N = 4,226) and 16 (N = 4,123), while in
the same weeks in 2017 to 2019 these numbers were on average 1,177 and 767 respectively.
After these peaks, the number of new registrations declined and by week 20, when the
number of confirmed infections with SARS-CoV-2 had declined and primary schools
reopened, they were back to levels comparable to 2017-2019.

bars indicate the number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in the Netherlands in that
particular week (cf. secondary axis on the right).

Overall, more donors newly registered in the first 20 weeks of 2020 compared to the
first 20 weeks of 2017, 2018, and 2019. Compared to 2019 – the highest of the three
previous years in terms of new donor registrations – the number of newly registered donors
in 2020 grew from 23,997 to 36,573 (+52%), particularly in weeks 11-20 (from 10,885 in 2019
to 26,623 in 2020, +145%). As week 11 marked the first nation-wide infection prevention
measures in the Netherlands and Sanquin’s appeal for donations, we looked in more detail
at the people that registered as new donors between weeks 11-20 (cf. Table 1). The average
age of these donors in 2020 was 34.5 (SD = 12.4) years, which is older compared to the

9

donors who registered during weeks 11-20 of the previous years (M2017 = 27.8, SD2017 = 10.5;
M2018 = 29.6, SD2018 = 10.7; M2019 = 28.8, SD2019 = 10.5), F (1, 59786) = 1284.20, p < .001, ηp2 =
.06. Even though the absolute number of new donor registrations in all age categories in
2020 was higher compared to the three previous years, the increase in registrations was
particularly remarkable for the oldest age category. The number of newly registered donors
aged 55 or up in 2020 was 2,262, which was more than 7 times higher than 320 newly
registered donors in 2018 (i.e. the year with the highest number of new donors of the three
previous years). Furthermore, the share of the oldest age category amongst all new
registrants increased significantly (i.e. 8.5% in 2020 compared to 2.4-2.7% for the previous
three years). The ratio of female versus male new registrants was significantly different in
2020 compared to the other three years, as the percentage of female registrant was lower in
2020 (63%) compared to 2017-2019 (67-69%), χ2 (3) = 227.97, p <.001.
The Netherlands is divided into twelve provinces, and each of these provinces
recorded higher numbers of newly registered donors in weeks 11-20 in 2020 compared to
the years 2017-2019 (see Table 2). However, the increase in newly registered donors was
particularly large in the provinces most affected by COVID-19. For instance, in NoordBrabant – where the first COVID-19 cases in the Netherlands were found – the number of
newly registered donors increased from 1,714 in 2018 to 4,513 in 2020 (+163%). Similar
observations (compared to 2018) were made in the provinces of Zuid-Holland (+125%),
Noord-Holland (+151%), Gelderland (+107%), and Limburg (+137%). The provinces in the
north(-east) and south-west of the Netherlands (Drenthe, Groningen, Friesland, Zeeland)
had much less COVID-19 cases and also showed less pronounced increases in new donor
registrations (+49-78% in 2020 compared to 2018).
Media attention

10

Fig 2 displays the number of posts that mentioned Sanquin and/or blood donation on
Facebook, Twitter and Instagram in the first 20 weeks of 2017-2020. Of the 27,814 messages
about blood donation, 4,345 (15.6%) were from Sanquin. Of these messages by Sanquin, the
large majority (4,258, or 98%) were replies to other users’ posts (e.g., replies to questions
about eligibility). The 8,808 messages about Sanquin contained 361 (4.1%) messages that
were from Sanquin, 334 (93%) consisted of replies to other users’ posts. Only a very small
proportion of all social media messages thus consisted of original posts from Sanquin, and
the contents of these posts was the same across the different social media platforms. The
main peak in in social media messages in 2020 is observed during weeks 11 and 12, when
Sanquin called for donations due to blood shortages. A smaller peak is observed in week 16
of 2020, after Sanquin announced (in week 15) that they would be testing for SARS-CoV-2
antibodies during specific weeks and Sanquin announced to help with PCR testing for COVID19 cases (in week 16). These social media peaks appear to precede the peaks in new donor
registrations.

11

The first peak in mentions of Sanquin in newspapers in 2020 coincides with the first
social media peak, in week 11-12 (Fig 3). The second peak appeared in week 15, which was
related to the announcement that Sanquin had started to measure SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in
donor blood, just before a peak in new donor registrations in week 16. Finally, newspapers’
attention for Sanquin peaked again in week 19 and was related to the announcement that
Sanquin received a large number of tests for measuring SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. This last
peak appears to coincide with a minor uptick in the number of new donor registrations
(week 19 in Fig 1).

DISCUSSION
Even though blood donation during a pandemic might pose a health risk for the
individual donor due to the inability to keep physical distance during the donation
procedure, our results show a large increase of new donors registrations, suggesting the
motivations outweigh this health risk. Remarkably, individuals at higher risk of attracting

12

SARS-CoV-2 appeared to be particularly well-represented among new registrants, such as
older people and people from areas of the Netherlands that were affected most (in terms of
COVID-19 cases) during the early stages of the pandemic. The peaks in new donor
registrations seemed to coincide with peaks in (social) media attention for blood donation in
general and for Sanquin in particular.
In the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic, blood collection agencies around
the world are operating under unprecedented conditions. The already vulnerable balance
between supply and demand has been further challenged during the past months, balancing
preventive measures to decrease the spread of the coronavirus with collecting enough blood
to keep up with routine procedures and ongoing demands. Although the Netherlands, like
many other countries, postponed non-urgent patient care (including surgery) during the
acute pandemic phase, blood banks needed to keep their stocks at an appropriate level and
hence continued to call for new donors and donations [17, 18]. General awareness for blood
donation has increased enormously with the COVID-19 pandemic. Many blood banks had
started to test donations for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to monitor the spread of the virus across
regions and countries [19, 20] and started to collect convalescent plasms of recovered
COVID-19 patients for possible treatments and therapies. As we have shown here, these
developments were widely discussed in Dutch regional and national newspapers and on
social media.
This increased awareness for blood donation, together with all media attention
around COVID-19 as a public health challenge and associated safety measures, apparently
encouraged many to register as a blood donor. Compared to the years before, the number
of new donors that registered during the acute pandemic phase (weeks 11-20) more than
doubled. Similar large increases in new donor registrations have been found elsewhere, e.g.

13

Denmark, Italy, and some regions in the US [21]. While the total number of active blood
donors in the Netherlands has been decreasing from more than 400,000 donors in 2010 to
about 330,000 donors in 2018 [20], the COVID-19 pandemic led to great increases in new
donor registrations. The urgent call for blood and increased media attention for Sanquin may
have contributed to these new donor registrations. Attention for blood banks and blood
donation in different media may be an important factor in explaining why some countries
succeeded in attracting large numbers of new donors [21] whereas other countries mainly
observed cancellations and no-shows [6, 7].
With regard to individual risk for contracting SARS-CoV-2, we made some remarkable
observations. For instance, we found that the share of older people (ages 55 and up) among
new donor registrations increased from 2.4-2.7% % in 2017 to 2019 to 8.5% in 2020, in spite
of the fact that older age is a known risk factor for more severe COVID-19 [22]. Similarly, the
large majority and the biggest increase of newly registered donors (compared to the
previous year) came from the regions of the country most affected by COVID-19. Hence,
higher individual risks of attracting the virus did not prevent these people from contributing
to the blood supply. One could speculate that these individuals have encountered the
consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic more closely than others, which motivated them
more to contribute to society during unprecedented times and also made them more aware
of the need for blood. Another option is that some of these new donors registered hoping
that they would be tested for antibodies (i.e. test-seeking behavior). Unfortunately, new
donor motivations are not registered in detail, making it impossible to determine whether
test-seeking for COVID-19 actually occurred. However, the first peak in new donor
registrations took place before Sanquin announced they would be testing for antibodies (to
assess herd immunity), and Sanquin clearly and repeatedly stressed that donors would not

14

receive the test results. This indicates that at least part of the newly registered donors did
not register out of test-seeking motivations. Still, further research is needed to better
understand the role that test-seeking may have played among motivations for new donors
to register during the (first phase of) the pandemic.
To conclude, the COVID-19 pandemic, a public health crisis with enormous societal
impact, seems to have motivated many individuals in the Netherlands, in particular those at
an increased risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or developing more severe COVID-19, to
register for blood and plasma donation. They probably did so out of a motivation to
contribute to the public good and public health. This was potentially triggered by increased
(social) media attention for Sanquin and for blood and (convalescent) plasma donation. Time
and future studies will have to tell whether these new donors are one-off ‘pandemic’ donors
or if they will become regular, loyal donors.

APPENDIX S1
Newspaper data collection
Newspaper articles were collected through Lexis-Nexis Uni database
(www.lexisnexis.nl). All national and regional newspapers with a paper edition were included
with the exception of “Friesch Dagblad” as it was not available on Lexis-Nexis Uni (see Table
3 for the full list of included papers). The search term “Sanquin” was used to collect the
sample.

Social media data collection
Online messages were collected through Coosto (www.coosto.nl). We limited our
dataset to public posts on the three largest social media platforms on which Sanquin is most
active: Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. We applied a search string to find public social
media messages about Blood donation. This process is comparable to the process of finding
literature for a literature review. Similar to Ramondt et al. [12], we included various
(combinations of) terms related to blood donors, blood donations, and blood collection
agencies to find social media messages about blood donation):
bloeddon* OR plasmadon* OR ((bloed OR plasma) NEAR(3) (donor* OR donatie OR doneren
OR gedoneerd OR geven OR gegeven OR schenken OR geschonken)) OR bloedbank OR
sanquin OR (sanguin OR #bloedbank OR #bloeddonatie OR #bloeddoneren OR #bloeddonor
OR #bloeddonordag OR #bloeddonoren OR #bloeddonors OR #bloedgeven OR
#bloedgevendoetleven OR #bloedisleven OR #bloedplasma OR #bloedvoorziening OR
#blooddonation OR #blooddonor OR #geefbloed OR #ikgeefbloed OR #plasmadonatie OR
#plasmadonor OR #wereldbloeddonordag OR #worldblooddonorday OR missingtype) OR

This left us with messages about blood donation (i.e., social media: blood donation) used in
Figure 2. To collect the social media data about Sanquin in particular, another step was
required. The collected social media data from Coosto was loaded into R and another search
string was applied. The data was preprocessed to be lowercase and the terms “sanquin” OR
“bloedbank” (“blood bank” in Dutch) were used to identify social media messages about
Sanquin.
