Abstract
This paper investigates the profile of COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong, highlighting
the unique age structure of confirmed cases compared to other states. Whilst the
majority of cases in most states around the world have fitted an older age profile,
our analysis shows that positive cases in Hong Kong have been concentrated
amongst younger age groups, with the largest incidence of cases reported in the
15-24 age group. This is despite the population’s rapidly ageing structure and
extremely high levels of population density. Using detailed case data from Hong
Kong’s Centre for Health Department and Immigration Department, we analyze
the sex and age distribution of the confirmed cases along with their recent travel
histories and immigration flows for the period January to April, 2020. Our analysis
highlights Hong Kong’s high proportion of imported cases and large overseas
student population in developing COVID-19 hotspot areas such as the United
Kingdom. Combined with targeted and aggressive early policy measures taken to
contain the virus, these factors may have contributed to the uniquely younger age
structure of COVID-19 cases in the city. Consequently, this young profile of
confirmed cases may have prevented fatalities in the city-state.

Introduction
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China [hereafter
Hong Kong] is a city and special administrative region of China in the eastern Pearl River Delta

1

by the South China Sea. In 2019, Hong Kong had roughly 7.5 million people in a
1,104-square-kilometre (426 square miles) territory whilst in Kowloon, where more than 3 in 10
residents reside, population density is at 48,930 persons per square kilometre. This makes it
one of the most densely populated territories in the world ​(1)​. Apart from being a rapidly ageing
society ​(2, 3)​, Hong Kong is also a migration destination. For the period 2015 to 2020, the net
migration rate is 147,000 or a net of four in-migrants per 1,000 population ​(1)​.
With its proximity to mainland China and its very high population density, Hong Kong will
continuously face the challenges of infectious diseases mainly because of increasing
environmental pollution, high migration inflows and outflows, the emergence of new infections
as well as the changing lifestyle and behaviour of its residents ​(4, 5)​. The most recent
significant outbreak was the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak which
reached Hong Kong in March 2003 ​(5)​. Based on World Health Organization (WHO) data until
July 11, 2003, a total of 1,755 SARS cases had been identified in the city-state, of which 298
people died of the disease ​(6)​. At that point, it was largely believed that Hong Kong was
unprepared to be one of the epicenters of the SARS epidemic. From this recent experience, did
Hong Kong learn the hard lessons of the past?
The WHO officially declared the novel Coronavirus infections (hereafter COVID-19) outbreak as
a pandemic on March 11, 2020, after it had spread to more than 100 countries and resulted in
tens of thousands of cases within a few months. In Hong Kong, however, the first case was
reported on January 23, 2020. In early February, the government was strongly criticised for
policy responses in a variety of issues including the legality and access of face masks, border
closure, medical fees and quarantine policy ​(7)​. During this early period, unfavourable
comparisons were made with other regional governments (especially Macau and Singapore)
who appeared to be managing the crisis more effectively ​(8, 9)​. However, by the time of writing
in late April 2020 Hong Kong could stake a claim to having got the disease ‘under control’, with
no new cases in six out of the past ten days ​(10)​. That this occurred without the general
lockdown policies seen in other parts of the world is even more remarkable.
Our study includes an examination of the age and sex distribution of the COVID-19 confirmed
cases in Hong Kong and an analysis of how the different measures to combat this outbreak
resulted in a relatively fewer number of cases and deaths. Specifically, as demographers we
wished to explore the extent to which insights from demographic science could assist in
explaining the nature of the Hong Kong experience of COVID-19. In this descriptive, exploratory
paper, we highlight the potential impact of the young profile of the confirmed cases on the total
number of mortalities and the effect of the early aggressive policy measures including travel
bans, enforced quarantines and contact-tracing imposed by the Hong Kong government as
early as January 27, 2020 in containing the spread of the COVID-19.
Results
Age Profile of Confirmed COVID-19 cases

2

Compared with the aging Hong Kong population ​(1)​, the COVID-19 confirmed cases have an
entirely different distribution. Figure 1 shows the age and sex distribution of the 1,017 confirmed
COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong as of April 16, 2020. In Hong Kong the majority (63.8%) of
confirmed cases are in the 15 to 44 age bracket. Broken down further, 27.4% of cases are aged
15-24, 19.7% aged 25-34 and 16.7% aged 35-44. Less than a tenth (7.9%) are aged above 65.
This age distribution of the local COVID-19 confirmed cases does not fit the general profile of
other countries wherein the infections are more concentrated among those in the older age
groups. Although, of course, this may be related to testing patterns by age, rather than true
differences in incidence. The WHO Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report 89
shows that as of April 13, 2020, there is a total of 716,570 confirmed cases with reported
information on age and sex coming from 113 countries, territories and areas; of these confirmed
cases, the median age for males is 52 (interquartile range, IQR: 36-65) years and for females
50 (IQR 35-64) years ​(11)​. Examples of countries with an older profile of confirmed cases are
Mainland China wherein the majority of confirmed cases (54.0%) as of February 11, 2020
belong to the older age groups, at least 50 years old ​(12) and the Philippines wherein as of
March 25, 2020, the majority of the confirmed cases are in the age group 50 and older ​(13)​.
There is also an imbalanced sex ratio among the COVID-19 confirmed cases in Hong Kong with
a higher proportion among men in almost age groups except the 25-34 age groups and those in
the 70 years old and older. This sex profile is similar to the outbreaks in other countries ​(12, 13)
The youngest confirmed cases in Hong Kong are two males, under one-year-old while the
oldest confirmed case is a 96-year-old female. Nearly half of the 1,017 confirmed cases (48.0%)
have already been discharged from the hospital.
In short, COVID-19 confirmed cases in Hong Kong are found primarily among the working and
school-age groups and among men. By April 16, 2020, almost three months after the first
reported case on January 23, 2020, four deaths among confirmed COVID-19 cases were
reported in Hong Kong. Three such were over 70 years old (2 males and 1 female) while the
fourth was the case of a 39-year old male. It is possible that this young age structure of
confirmed cases in Hong Kong contributed to the extremely low numbers of fatalities compared
to other states.
FIGURE ONE ABOUT HERE
A large proportion of Hong Kong’s confirmed cases were ‘imported’; 61.0% of confirmed cases
have travel history from countries with widespread infection or were directly infected by a
confirmed case who travelled, hence, they are considered cases with imported transmission
(see Figure 2). Two-fifths of these imported confirmed cases (41.1%) are young adults in the
age group 15-24 years old. The proportion of imported versus local cases differs significantly
based on age group. Nine in 10 of the confirmed cases in the 15-24 age group (91.4%), the
group with the largest incidence of COVID-19, were in fact imported. In contrast, 59.7% of

3

cases aged 55-64 and less than half of those in other age groups are considered imported (data
not shown).
FIGURE TWO ABOUT HERE
Of note is that most of Hong Kong’s cases in the younger age groups occurred in a second
wave of infections during March. Before March 18, 2020, the age group with the highest
frequency of COVID-19 cases was 55-64 followed closely by the 65+ age group (see Figure 3).
However, after March 18, 2020 the number of new cases in Hong Kong sharply increased, most
of these being imported cases in younger age groups. This timing of these imported cases is
similar to that experienced by China wherein the imported cases more than doubled starting
from March 18, 2020, mostly coming from countries with high outbreak of COVID-19 infections
like the United Kingdom (UK), United States of America (USA) and Spain ​(14)​. However, age
data about imported cases is not available in China.
FIGURE THREE ABOUT HERE
Travel History of COVID-19 Cases
Our analysis of the travel histories of Hong Kong cases shows that the majority of imported
cases in the 15-24 age group may be Hong Kong residents who are studying or working abroad.
We used the travel history data collected and archived by the Centre for Health Protection
(CHP) over the study period and matched case numbers from the case data to study the travel
history and age profile of imported cases. The data collected by the CHP contains the travel
histories of all confirmed COVID-19 cases up to fourteen days before the case was reported
and formed part of attempts of the government to track and trace the movements of all newly
reported cases. This is done in order to contact and isolate anyone with whom they had close
contact in the days before the onset of symptoms, including those whom they may have sat
close to on flights. Of the 508 COVID-19 cases with an overseas travel history tracked by the
CHP, 47.4% were imported from the UK, 9.1% from the USA and 3.9% each from Qatar,
Canada and Switzerland. By far the largest age group with a travel history was those aged
15-24 with 205 cases, of which the majority were from the UK (62.4%), 8.3% from the USA, and
about 5.0% each from Switzerland, Qatar and the Netherlands. The next largest group with
travel histories was those aged 25-34 with 86 cases, nearly half of these coming from the UK
(48.8%). We are not able to ascertain the employment or other characteristics of these cases.
Hong Kong has a large population of mobile residents who hold citizenship or permanent
residency but work, study or are retired overseas. According to the 2016 by-census, just under
220,000 permanent residents of Hong Kong were deemed ‘mobile’, meaning they had spent
between one to three months in the city of the previous six ​(15)​. In 2016, 47,938 Hong Kong
residents aged 15-24 were deemed to be mobile, most of whom were students. The next largest
population of mobile residents were those aged over 65 (42,299) who were mostly retired, whilst
a further 40,926 were aged 55 to 64 mostly employees or retirees. In addition, Hong Kong is

4

home to a sizable number of non-permanent residents; many of these residents may return to
their home countries on a regular basis for study, work, or family visits. According to the 2016
Hong Kong by-census, the largest groups of non-Chinese nationals were Filipinos (186,000)
and Indonesians (159,901), most of whom work as domestic workers on temporary
foreign-worker permits. Hong Kong was also home to 35,069 British citizens, almost 15,000
Americans and 66,690 citizens from South Asian countries (India, Nepal and Pakistan), whilst a
further 121,775 Hong Kong Chinese were registered as being domiciled overseas in 2016 ​(15)​.
The large increases in newly confirmed cases in the younger age groups, the majority of which
were imported, occurred from March 10, 2020 onward (Figure 4). This was in tandem with a
large increase in confirmed cases and deaths throughout multiple countries in Europe, the USA
and Canada. On March 13, 2020, the Hong Kong Security Bureau had announced a ‘Red
Outbound Travel Alert’ (“Red OTA”) for the Schengen area, announcing a mandatory 14-day
home quarantine for all arrivals from the Schengen area. This was followed by a Red OTA for
Ireland, United Kingdom and the USA on March 15, 2020 with the announcement of home
quarantine arrangements for all travellers from the three states to begin four days later (see SI
Appendix Annex B for a full timeline of policy events).
Figure 4 shows the arrivals into Hong Kong over the period from January 24, 2020 to April 16,
2020. Most arrivals were Hong Kong residents travelling via the airport. On February 4, 2020,
all land and sea border points were closed except for two control points – the Shenzhen Bay
control point and Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. Daily arrivals into the city fell dramatically
after the end of the Chinese lunar new year holidays which is by the end of January, 2020 and
took another dramatic fall after the home quarantine arrangements for all arrivals from China
were put into place on February 8, 2020. Arrival numbers followed a relatively steady pattern at
under 25,000 per day until dropping off sharply from March 19, 2020, when the new 14-day
home quarantine arrangements were put in place for all arrivals into the city, regardless of
whether or not they were residents. From March 25, 2020, all non-residents were barred from
entering the city except for nationals of Macau, Taiwan or mainland China.
Other measures taken by the Hong Kong government
These border closures and sharply lower inbound-travel movements together with Hong Kong’s
aggressive policy of testing, contact-tracing and quarantine of confirmed cases and their close
contacts (see SI Appendix Annex B) undoubtedly contributed to the sharp decline in newly
confirmed cases during the month of April ​(16)​. On April 20, 2020, Hong Kong recorded its first
day without a confirmed case, from a peak of more than 60 cases per day in late March. Social
distancing and rapid population behavioural changes also likely played a role, with measures
such as wearing masks, working from home and school closures leading to an estimated 44.0%
reduction in seasonal influenza incidence ​(16)​. The containment of a severe local outbreak of
COVID-19 in Hong Kong thus far, and the very high incidence of confirmed cases in younger
age groups mostly amongst Hong Kong residents returning to the city from overseas hotspot
areas, have surely contributed to the very low number of fatalities in the city-state, with only four

5

deaths reported by April 23, 2020 out of 1,030 confirmed cases. One death occurred in the 80
years and over age group, out of twelve total cases. In Italy, China and South Korea, vastly
higher case fatality rates were recorded for those in the older age groups; as at March 31, 2020
case fatality rates for those above 80 years old were at 27.7% in Italy and 18.3% in South Korea
(17, 18)​.

Discussion
A recent paper in ​PNAS ​highlighted the importance of a demographic approach to
understanding COVID-19 transmission and fatality rates ​(18)​. In particular, it was suggested that
the age structure of initial cases, along with early detection and treatment, likely explains the low
numbers of fatalities in South Korea and Germany. The experience in Hong Kong shows that
whilst an older population age structure may be important for understanding a higher prevalence
of COVID-19 ​(18)​, it is not a given. Despite having more than 18.0% of the population over the
age of 65 and an extremely high population density, a package of policies designed to contain
the virus spreading from younger imported cases and becoming a sustained local outbreak
ensured that case and mortality numbers stayed low.
A further difference between Hong Kong and other settings characterised by higher rates of
infection (and fatality) is the lower levels of distribution of residential care and support among
older persons. There is strong evidence that people living in residential/nursing homes are
particularly vulnerable to not only infection and its rapid spread, but to severe COVID-19
infection and fatality ​(19–21)​; so much so that the WHO referred to care home infection and
fatality rates as an ‘unimaginable human tragedy’ ​(22)​. In a study of official data in ten countries,
deaths in care homes account for between 19-72% of all deaths ​(21) - although international
comparison is difficult because of differences in cause of death reporting as testing procedures.
In common with other parts of the world, the Hong Kong government has issued guidelines to
support residential care homes in preventing infection ​(23)​, as well as offering other support in
terms of provision of personal protective equipments (PPEs) and infection protection services
(24) and a switch to online care support for those who would ordinarily visit day care centers
(25)​. There may thus be institutional reasons for the low levels of transmission among older
people. The size and percentage of the older population resident in care homes differs widely
around the world ​(26)​. In the UK, where a high percentage of infections and fatalities have
occurred in care homes ​(19, 20)​, we estimate that around 5.3% of the population aged over 70
is resident in care homes ​(27, 28)​. In addition, a further 6.9% of that population receive care
support in their own homes, including from carers making multiple home visits in a day potentially another area of risk for infection ​(27, 28)​. In Hong Kong, meanwhile, we estimate the
proportion of over 70s in residential/nursing homes to be around 3.6% ​(1, 29)​. These lower
rates of care home residence may have contributed to lower overall transmission and fatality
numbers amongst the elderly by creating lower opportunities for sustained local spread within
the elderly population.

An already neglected group in terms of health and other support mechanisms during this
pandemic ​(30)​, low-income migrant workers represent a further group often characterised by
communal living. Highly elevated transmission rates have been seen in some settings where
such migrant workers often live in cramped, unsanitary conditions ​(31)​. In Singapore, for
example, over half of the purpose-built and factory-converted dormitories have been affected
(32)​; a factor held primarily responsible for the ‘second wave’ of infections in the city-state. It has
been estimated that some 80% of all cases have been linked to such dormitories. Compared to
Singapore, such ‘dormitories’ are rare in Hong Kong. Perhaps the primary, related housing
issue in Hong Kong is 'subdivided housing’: home to up to 209,000 poor, urban individuals ​(33)
and sometimes referred to as ‘coffin houses’ because of their very small sizes ​(34)​. While often
characterised by poor hygiene, environmental ​(35) and safety ​(36)​, it appears that policy
measures in Hong Kong, which succeeded in stemming local transmission chains, meant these
quasi-communal units were not left exposed to rapid COVID-19 transmission.
A final possible factor mentioned by Dowd et al. ​(18) concerns the possibility that
‘intergenerational interactions, co-residence, and commuting may have accelerated the
outbreak in Italy through social networks that increased the proximity of elderly to initial cases.’
This would be derived from a mechanism whereby the younger population most susceptible to
initial infection ​(37) transmit to the elder population through such contact. In Hong Kong,
multi-generational residence is common ​(38)​, where around 50% of older-65s live with their
adult children ​(39) - much higher than in Italy (or, indeed, any other setting in Europe or North
America characterised by high transmission rates) ​(40)​. The extremely high population density
of Hong Kong coupled with short distances and highly efficient transport systems means that
there is a high degree of residential proximity as well regular contact between older parents and
their children. A further dimension of intergenerational, intra-household interaction involves
migrant domestic workers, who increasingly operate a key means of care support within the
household. There is little evidence in Hong Kong that such workers were responsible for
transmission within the household. As such, the hypothesis suggested for Italy appears
inconsistent with the Hong Kong case at least.
As of April 29 2020, Hong Kong has reported no new cases for the sixth time in ten days ​(10)​.
From the start of May, public facilities will start to reopen, some border restrictions are to be
lifted and civil servants will return to work in their offices. Of course, in the near future it is
eminently possible that events have taken a turn for the worse and a ​third wave of infections
occur. This paper takes a social scientific approach to illustrate the particularities of COVID-19
outcomes in Hong Kong up until now; clearly, much more research is required to concretely
establish both the epidemiological and social factors contributing to the Hong Kong experience.
Despite this, Hong Kong has clearly demonstrated a capacity to control both the transmission
and fatality of COVID-19 until this point. Policy interventions, institutional systems, household
and living arrangements each played a role in a complex, interwoven way. However, we must
not overlook the role played by the community itself who, through behavioural change and
increased vigilance, appear to have been equally instrumental in shaping Hong Kong’s

7

COVID-19 experience. It may be in this way that the greatest lessons of SARS have been
learned ​(5)​.

Materials and methods
Data on confirmed COVID-19 cases was taken from the CHP of the Hong Kong Department of
Health. We assessed the age and sex distribution of the confirmed cases, discharge status
(discharged, hospitalized or died) and type of transmission. We estimated the trend of
cumulative cases by age group from January 23 to April 16, 2020 to determine the age group
that registers the highest number of confirmed cases over time. Daily migrant inflows and
outflows data was retrieved from the Hong Kong Immigration Department showing arrivals at
each border checkpoint into Hong Kong broken down by citizenship status. In addition, we
retrieved detailed archived datasets pertaining to the travel histories of confirmed COVID-19
cases which are updated on an almost daily basis by the CHP. We excluded travel histories
pertaining to domestic travel (buses, trains and ferries) and a small number of journeys
pertaining to outbound from Hong Kong. We linked travel histories to confirmed case IDs to
examine the age structure and timing of cases where the apparent source of infection was not in
Hong Kong (i.e. not a community infection). This includes cases with a travel history from
countries with widespread infection or where infection from a confirmed case who travelled
occurred. By doing so, we highlight the importance of returnee Hong Kong residents from
overseas hotspots on the relatively young age structure of confirmed cases during the second
wave in March, 2020. We also gathered data on policy measures implemented by the Hong
Kong government, highlighting the impact of major border closures and quarantine
arrangements imposed by the Hong Kong government in reducing further numbers of imported
COVID-19 infections. We also utilized secondary data for comparative demographic analyses
from the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department, United Nations Population Division and
the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

Annex A

Confirmed Cases Data
Data on confirmed COVID-19 cases was taken from the Centre for Health Protection [CHP] of
the Hong Kong Department of Health. We assessed the age and sex distribution of the
confirmed cases, discharge status (discharged, hospitalized or died) and type of transmission.
We estimated the trend of cumulative cases by age group from ​January 23 to April 16, 2020 to
determine the age group that registers the highest number of confirmed cases over time.

Population Data
We utilized data for comparative demographic analyses from the Hong Kong Census and
Statistics Department, United Nations Population Division and the Chinese Center for Disease
Control and Prevention.

Migrant Flows
Data on daily migrant inflows and outflows was retrieved from the Hong Kong Immigration
Department, showing arrivals at each border checkpoint into Hong Kong broken down by
citizenship status from January 24 to April 16.
R Code
## This code pulls daily data related to migrant inflows and outflows from the Hong Kong
Immigration Department website and writes it into two data sets containing data on inflows and
data on outflows

Travel History Data
We retrieved detailed archived datasets pertaining to the travel histories of confirmed COVID-19
cases which are updated on an almost daily basis by the Centre for Health Protection. Our
process for obtaining the final travel history dataset was as follows:
-

-

-

Using the Hong Kong Government Open Data centre at data.gov.hk we extracted all
historical CSV files updated by the Centre for Health Protection between January to April
2020.
We merged the files and excluded travel histories pertaining to domestic travel (labelled
as buses, trains and ferries).
We excluded a small number of journeys pertaining to outbound flights from Hong Kong.
We restricted the dataset to unique cases based on COVID-19 case ID number, date
and flight ID.
For case IDs who had logged multiple flights in the travel history database we took the
starting city of their journey. For example, a case who had logged two flights from Paris
to Dubai and Dubai to Hong Kong was coded as Paris.
Based on the starting travel destination we coded the starting country of travel.
We matched the case IDs to the confirmed cases dataset which included details about
age, sex, onset of symptoms and date of confirmed test.

Annex B
Policy Measures
We also gathered data on policy measures implemented by the Hong Kong government,
highlighting the impact of major border closures and quarantine arrangements imposed by the
Hong Kong government in reducing further numbers of imported COVID-19 infections. A
timeline of major events and interventions is listed below.
