ABSTRACT

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has impacted not only physical health but also mental health
and wellbeing globally. These impacts can be critically higher among marginalized individuals
and populations like farmers in India. While most of them live in poor socioeconomic conditions,
recent psychosocial challenges due to the COVID-19 lockdown had brought endless suffering in
their lives. In this article, we describe a case of suicide of an Indian farmer amid COVID-19
lockdown, who had debts and could not find laborers during the lockdown leading to a helpless
situation committing suicide. In India, nearly 16,500 farmers commit suicide each year, which
can aggravate if psychosocial and economic challenges like COVID-19 continues to affect them.
We recommend psychosocial interventions among vulnerable farmers alongside strengthening
economic support and institutional measures alleviating socioeconomic challenges and
minimizing disparities in social determinants of suicidal behavior to prevent suicide among
Indian farmers amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Suicide of a farmer amid COVID-19 in India

Introduction
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global health concern that is
impacting both physical and mental health across populations. Alongside depression,
anxiety, distress, phobia, and many other psychological impacts (Rajkumar, 2020),
COVID-19 is also found to be associated with suicidal behavior (Sher, 2020). Several
cases of suicide are reported amid COVID-19 (Goyal et al., 2020; Mamun and Griffiths,
2020; Sahoo et al., 2020), where the affected individual experienced psychosocial
stressors attributable to fears and misconceptions on COVID-19. In this article, we
describe a case of suicide committed by a farmer in India, evaluate the social
determinants of suicidal behavior in that context, and discuss potential interventions
addressing the same.

COVID-19 and suicide of a farmer in India
Rajkaran Shukla, a 52-year-old farmer from Uttar Pradesh, India, reportedly committed
suicide by hanging himself from a tree in his own agricultural field (The Telegraph,
2020). Reports from his family members and villagers provided several insights on the
etiology of his suicide. He recently lost two-acre lentil crop out of his four acres land due
to waterlogging. Similar incidence threatened the remaining two-acre land where he
cultivated wheat, necessitating rapid harvesting to save the crop. However, harvesting
required laborers who refused to work during the lockdown. Rajkaran was also worried
about repaying Rs. 1.5 lacs of debt that he had taken from a private moneylender.

Social determinants of suicidal behavior among Indian farmers
The case of Rajkaran Shukla is unique as he was not living with a fear of being infected
with COVID-19, as seen in earlier cases of suicide amid this pandemic (Goyal et al.,
2020; Mamun and Griffiths, 2020; Sahoo et al., 2020). Rather, he experienced critical
psychosocial stressors that determined his suicidal behavior, especially when he lost
hope to harvest due to the scarcity of laborers (The Telegraph, 2020). A nationwide

lockdown has impacted mobility and employment across India, where the marginalized
populations like farmers and day laborers are affected the most (BBC, 2020). As this
informal workforce remains beyond the scope of institutional assessments and
protections, economic benefits offered through organized approaches are less likely to
reach these populations effectively. Those who are already living under poor
socioeconomic conditions and experiencing adverse psychosocial events become more
vulnerable to the psychological impacts of COVID-19 as they have fewer means to cope
with the challenging situations around themselves.
Suicidal behavior is not new among farmers in India. Between 1995 and 2012, a total of
298,084 cases of suicides are recorded among Indian farmers with an estimation that
nearly 16,500 farmers die by suicide in India each year (Nagaraj et al., 2014). This
number is likely to be underreported as the cases of suicide are less likely to be
documented, and the underlying reasons associated with those cases remain unexplored
and unaddressed. A review evaluated factors associated with such a high burden of
suicide among Indian farmers (Merriott, 2016), which found that socioeconomic
factors, rather than psychiatric problems, were predominantly associated with suicidal
behavior in this vulnerable population. Those factors include a lack of agricultural
investments, increased credits from noninstitutional sources, the use of cash crops,
issues related to irrigation, and challenges associated with trading the crops. These
challenges highlight the importance of emphasizing on social determinants of mental
health among Indian farmers. Their day-to-day life is constrained by structural
inequities that affect their socioeconomic wellbeing and quality of living (Merriott,
2016; Nagaraj et al., 2014). Moreover, a prolonged deterioration of psychosocial health
and wellbeing often leaves them helpless and hopeless, making it difficult for them to
cope with acute stressors, often leading to suicidal behavior.
COVID-19 may directly impact mental health and wellbeing among individuals and
populations; however, infection prevention measures like lockdown may have indirect
socioeconomic and psychological implications (Hiremath et al., 2020; Hossain et al.,
2020b), as found in the case of Rajkaran Shukla. A lack of unavailability of laborers
amid COVID-19 lockdown was a critical challenge for him, whereas he had already lost
one crop and had been living with debt and associated psychosocial stress (The

Telegraph, 2020). Taken together, preexisting psychosocial challenges followed by
adverse life events amid COVID-19 may have influenced his suicide. Furthermore,
mental disorders are highly prevalent in India and other South Asian countries (Hossain
et al., 2020a), whereas the mental health systems are inadequate to provide preventive
and therapeutic care to the affected individuals. Especially in rural areas, both the
awareness of mental health and the availability of mental health services are critically
low (Maulik et al., 2018). Therefore, farmers experiencing depression, anxiety, and
suicidal behavior are less likely to receive mental health care, which could be another
imperative issue pertinent to inequitable mental health access among marginalized
individuals. Such challenges should be considered while assessing the social
determinants of suicidal behavior in this context. As harvesting season approaches in
India, more farmers like him are likely to experience similar challenges during this
lockdown, who would have deteriorated socioeconomic disparities and poor access to
psychosocial care when they need it most. These necessitate multipronged interventions
to prevent future cases of suicide among Indian farmers.

Recommended strategies for preventing suicide among farmers and
marginalized populations
Several strategies to prevent suicide are recommended in the context of COVID-19
(Gunnell et al., 2020). However, the relevance of such strategies should be carefully
assessed for marginalized individuals like Indian farmers, who continue to experience
unique psychosocial challenges associated with suicidal behavior. We recommend the
following strategies to prevent suicide among farmers and marginalized populations in
India:
1. Extending institutional financial aid to provide immediate support to recover
from economic losses amid COVID-19
2. Revising the rates of interests and terms of repayment for institutional loans as
appropriate for each context and individual needs

3. Evaluating informal debts and arranging formal agreements under the
supervision of public regulatory authorities alleviating the economic burden
among marginalized individuals
4. Mobilizing public and private agencies to facilitated harvesting and trading of
crops during the peak season
5. Recruiting laborers, temporary workers, and volunteers using preventive
precautions monitored by local health and agricultural authorities
6. Strengthening social welfare and safety-net programs to protect the ultra-poor
during the COVID-19 lockdown
7. Organizing mass media campaigns and infotainment programs to alleviate the
fear of COVID-19 and promote regular activities with preventive measures
8. Arranging community-based mental health promotion programs engaging
community stakeholders and psychosocial care providers
9. Incorporating mental health services in primary care as well as telemedicine
programs with provisions of referral for qualified cases
10. Providing targeted individual and group-based interventions for individuals who
have acute or chronic psychosocial problems
11. Prioritizing psychosocial needs of marginalized populations in health and social
policymaking amid COVID-19
12. Fostering multisectoral collaborations to improve social determinants of mental
health and continuum of psychosocial care for the affected individuals
These recommendations emphasize improving the root causes of suicidal behavior that
are associated with socioeconomic challenges experienced by Indian farmers alongside
psychosocial measures. Such multipronged interventions, especially those focusing on
alleviating agro-economic burden, may substantially reduce the risks of suicide among
farmers (Merriott, 2016). A study evaluating inter-state variations of suicide rates and
associated factors found that states with easy-to-access financial services and proagricultural policies had lower rates of suicide in India (Sadanandan, 2014). Amid
COVID-19 lockdown, such measures may substantially reduce the socioeconomic
challenges experienced by Indian farmers and prevent suicidal behavior.

Conclusion
COVID-19 is imposing psychosocial challenges among individuals and populations,
which can be unique and severe among marginalized populations like Indian farmers
who have a preexisting psychosocial burden of suicidal behavior. In addition to regular
mental health interventions, it is necessary to assess the social determinants of suicidal
behavior in this population and adopt multipronged multilevel interventions, including
social and economic support to the affected individuals. Furthermore, a well-committed
policy-level collaboration among mental health practitioners, researchers, health
policymakers, and stakeholders from social welfare authorities is critical to acknowledge
and address suicide among vulnerable farmers in India.
