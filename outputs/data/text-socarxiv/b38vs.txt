Abstract
The fear of being infected by the COVID-19 virus is widespread in the Canadian population.
This study examined the COVID-19 virus infection fears in a survey sample of 4,200 adult
Canadians aged 15 years old and over during the confinement period of June 21-26,
2020 and collected by Statistics Canada. A marketing segmentation analysis was carried
out using a roster of 13 perceived health risks items leading to the identification of
typical fears and the profiling of five major segments present in the Canadian adult
population: "Germophobes" (7%), "Crowd-Averse" (34%), "Fearless" (17%), "Outside
"Bubble"-Averse" (18%), and ""Nursing Homes-Averse" (24%). Health risk items included
a wide range of preoccupations such as visiting retirement homes, travelling by car or
airplane, attending public events, shopping, eating out, seeing doctors and/or
participating in sports or gyms. The five population segments were identified using a
combination of principal component and k-means cluster statistical analysis. Marketing
segmentation is a useful tool for decision makers to categorize population members and,
by doing so, facilitate better public campaigns, help design messages, and implement
changes that can promote more efficient ways to deal with the various societal
consequences of the COVID-19 confinement.
The segment mottos for the five segments can be summarized as follows: "Germs are
Everywhere"; "Too Many People!", "Infections are over-rated!" "I am sticking to my
bubble! and "Will not visit grandma today!". Regardless of place, circumstance and/or
activity, the Germophobes were extremely fearful of contracting the virus while members
of the Fearless segment, a polar opposite, underestimated health risks and carried on
with their lives with minor preoccupations. Crowd-Averse, Outside "Bubble"-Averse and
Nursing Homes-Averse segment members showed differences in terms of the foci of
COVID-19 for potential infections such as in crowds, nursing home visitations and/or
other activities such as taking care of individuals outside the household "bubble". Given
their unique perceptual profiles, public health messages will be more efficient if their
messages pay special attention to the particular socio-demographic, residential,
employment and psychosocial characteristics of segment members.

1.0. Background
The COVID‐19 virus has caused major disruptions across the world, after being declared as a
pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 31 January 2020 (WHO, 2020). This
pandemic has led to a break with ordinary routine activities and social contacts for most of the
world's population. Canada is presently undergoing the so-called "second" phase. As of 25
October 2020, there had been a total of 9,946 deaths attributed to the coronavirus in
Canada 2 . A larger number is expected in the coming months. Most of the reported cases
are in Canada's two most populous provinces, Ontario and Quebec, which have declared
different sanitary measures and confinement restrictions to deal with virus spread in the
population.
The fear of being infected by the COVID-19 virus is widespread in the Canadian population.
Fear is an important adaptive response to survival and is considered a major component of
anxiety (Maeng & Milad, 2015, Manderson and Levine, 2020). In the new environment,
participation in large gatherings, nursing home visitations and airplane travel are seen by
many as "risky" types of behaviour. Some people are afraid of being infected in public places
such as shopping malls, gyms, bars, restaurants and/or public transport. Others are more
concerned about being infected at home. Altruistic fear (fear that other family members may
be infected) is different in nature from ego-oriented fear or concern for one’s own well-being
(Alfaroy et. al, 2020). Health risk related perceptions are key in predicting desirable health
outcomes for the general population such as following sanitary guidelines emphasizing hand
washing, wearing masks and keeping social distance.
Market segments are groups of individuals who are similar in their reaction to one or more
mix of environmental elements (Grover and Briens, 2006). Communalities in terms of
perceived health-related fears define various possible market segments which can be targeted
by public health campaigns aimed at promoting social well-being and a giving a sense of
security to the general population. Using a sample of the adult population of Canada, the
central objectives of the marketing segmentation analysis presented here is to break down
the population into meaningful clusters of individuals (homogeneous) in terms of their
perceptual traits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Three central questions guided the
segmentation analysis: 1) What COVID-19 virus infection fears are the most commonly
reported by Canadians during the pandemic? 2) Can groups of individuals be
differentiated into attitudinal segments or clusters according to their types of fears? and
3) What are the typical socio-demographic, residential, employment and other
psychosocial characteristics of the members of these segments?. The CPSS-Series3
survey conducted by Statistics Canada was regarded as an ideal data source chosen to
empirically explore these three central research questions and produce a statistical
portrait of infection fears during the pandemic 3.

2.0.Sample and Measures
The CPSS-Series 3 survey (CPSS Series3) entitled "Resuming Economic and Social
Activities" is a voluntary online survey that collected information on the knowledge
and behaviours of approximately 4,200 Canadians aged 15 years old and over who
were residents of the 10 Canadian provinces. It was administered by Statistics
Canada between June 15-21, 2020 (the reference week). The probability panel of the
CPSS-Series3 was created by randomly selecting a subset of the Labour Force
Survey (LFS) respondents. The LFS collected a wide range of information on
commuting to work, economic recovery, family and caregiving, health risks and
preparedness in society and community 4.
A total of 13 infection risk scales were used for this analysis. These tapped into COVID19 perceived health concerns attached to various places and social activities after the
resumption of activities during the first wave of the pandemic. Scales were measured as
four point scores (1=not at all concerned, 2=somewhat concerned, 3=very concerned and
4=extremely concerned) which were treated as indicators of low, moderate, high and very
high infection risks respectively. The following general question was asked in the survey:
How concerned are you about the health risks of resuming the following activities (list of
13 activities provided) as the COVID-19 safety measures are relaxed?. The list of
infection risk items ranked by their average scale scores is presented in table 1. Visiting
retirement homes and travelling by airplane topped the chart of the "riskiest" types of
activities.
3.0.Statistical Methods and Segment Identification
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and k-means cluster analysis were used as the main
statistical techniques for segment identification (see detail of the methodologies followed in
Punj and Stewart (1983), Grover and Vriens (2006) and Salkind and Rasmussen (2010)). In
the first phase, Principal Components (statistical technique aimed at data reduction) extracted
4 major dimensions underlying information contained in the 13 scales of health risk related
items. In the second phase, using component scores of these dimensions capturing about half
of the total data variation (62%), k-means clustering analysis was applied to the CPSS-Series
data. This clustering algorithm was developed to sort survey respondents into a k number of
clusters through assignments and re-assignments based on the shortest distance between the
individual and the centroid (mass centre) of the cluster. The distance measure chosen for this
purpose was the Euclidean distance squared. For the cluster analysis k=2 to k=8 segment
solutions were tested. The k=6 solution proved to be the most valid and informative according
to the parsimonious reduction of the Within Sum of Squares (WSS) and the application of the
"elbow" criteria as a stopping rule in the partition of clusters (see technical appendix chart A1).
Statistics Canada has already released major findings of the CPSS-Series1, Series 2 and CPSS-3 surveys
(conducted between March 29-April 3, 2020 and June 15-21, 2020 respectively), which include: greater
anxieties over personal health and the health of others, that most Canadians were following health guidelines,
greater time spent on the internet and watching television, women were stricter in terms of following guidelines
than men, and youth were less likely to wear masks in public. Sources : 1)

The validation of the partition of the population into six clusters was verified using Analysis of
Variance (ANOVA) F tests where the cluster membership was used in the prediction of the
socio-demographic and attitudinal characteristics of respondents (see table A-2 in the
technical appendix). The highest predicted power of the cluster partition was found in
reference to the immigrant status of individuals (6% of variance explained of this particular
trait).

4.0. Findings
4.0. Segment Prevalence and Traits
According to the cluster analysis of the CPSS-Series 2 data, five uniquely profiled groups of
the Canadian adult population respondents were identified. Their membership was
distributed as follows: 7% in segment 1, 34% in segment 2, 17% in segment 3, 18% in
segment 4 and 24% in segment 5. Based on the typical activity profiles drawn from the 26
dichotomous scales, the segments were labeled as follows: Segment 1 – "Germophobes",
Segment 2-"Crowd-Averse", Segment 3-"Fearless", Segment 4-"Outside Bubble Averse",
Segment 5-"Nursing Homes-Averse" . The prevalence 5 (adult population % share) of these
segments is presented in pie chart 1.

A visual representation (PCA bi-plot) of the vector of activities and dimensions underlying the
data are displayed in chart 2. The first two components extracted by PCA accounted for
43.6% of the variance of all activity items. The first dimension represented by C1 (31.9%
of the total variance of items) opposed as polar cases Fearless vs. the Rest of segments in
terms a lesser or higher degree of fear regardless of places or activities. The second
dimension, represented by C2 (11.6% of the total variance of items), opposed the CrowdAverse and the Outside “Bubble”-Averse members as opposites. This opposition reveals a
dimension related to the amplitude of fear from less distant to more distant or with
regards to more impersonal members of society. The position of the Nursing Home-Averse
segment in the bi-plot suggests that visitations to these places were the most ominous in

6
terms of virus contagion for Canadians at this particular juncture of the pandemic.
Statistical Note: In the Chart 2 PCA bi-plot 6, the first two principal components extracted
from the data (C1 and C2) are shown. They are the most fundamental dimensions
summarizing the activity patterns reported by respondents. In the biplot, vectors represent
items which are presented as points in space. The bi-plot of the second component on the first
component is useful as it displays the correlations of variables in terms of various item vectors
of different magnitudes, directions and positions. Proximity of activity traits to group positions
in space suggests an over-representation of these traits with respect to the composition of
groups while greater distances suggests its converse. Correlations between two indicator
variables in component space are equal to the cosines of the angles between the indicator
vectors (θ), or r = cos(θ). Highly correlated variables are located at sharp angles from each
other (θ = 90 degrees or less) while those zero correlated are "orthogonal" to each other (θ = 90
degrees). If variables are perfectly negatively correlated, then θ = 360 degrees (vector in
opposite direction).

4.2. Segment Profile Summaries: Who Are they?
The following are the summary descriptions of the population segments found in the
CPSS-Series3 data:
Segment 1 – Germophobes (7% representing 2.3 million adult Canadians), Segment
Motto: "Germs are Everywhere!"
Members of this small population segment are very afraid and anxious about being
infected by the COVID-19 virus. They perceive all types of places and social occasions as
scenarios for potential contamination. Less than one in ten adult Canadians are part of
this cluster of individuals. They displayed the highest cumulative scores of all 13
infection risk scales. The highest scale scores for them were those referring to travelling
in their own cars (3.77 score points average), visiting nursing homes (3.32 score points
average) and travelling by plane (3.29 score points average). Over-representation of
females (55%), immigrants (44%) and individuals living in apartment buildings (46%) are
observable across segment members. The Germophobes are the least educated segment
of the five segments: almost half of the members of the group had an equivalent of high
school or below education (48%). One in five (20%) reported low levels of life satisfaction
at the time of the CPSS Series 3 survey.
Segment 2 – Crowd-Averse (34% representing 10.7 Million adult Canadians),
Segment Motto: "Too Many People!"
Crowd-Averse individuals represent about one third of the adult population of Canada.
Members of this segment are fear-specific oriented and react to the pandemic
environment by avoiding any possible contact with crowds and gatherings in public
places. They are particularly anxious with respect to attending shows (2.76 score points
average ), dining out (2.38 score points average) and/or participating in sport activities
and exercising in gyms (2.48 score points average ). About a third of the Crowd-Averse
(34% ) were 35 years old or younger, 61% were married and/or living in common-law
marital status and 41% had a level education equivalent to high school diploma or less.
About 12% of Crowd-Averse individuals reported low levels of life satisfaction at the time
of the survey.
Segment 3 – Fearless (17% representing 5.1 million adult Canadians), Segment
Motto:"Infections Are Over-Rated!"
Members of this population segment acknowledge possibilities of contracting the COVID19 virus but believe these are somewhat remote as feel secure in not contracting any
virus. They are not particularly anxious about a particular place and/or social occasion.
In contrast to all the other segments, Fearless segment members displayed the lowest
cumulative scores of all 13 infection risk scales (i.e.12 fear scale averages below an
average score of 2 points). Males are over-represented in this segment (59% to 49%
overall) as well as rural area residents (23% to 16% overall). About 44% of segment
members were 35 years old or younger and also 43% were living with a child 18 years or
old in the household. In terms of employment status, 62% were employed at work during
the reference week. Only 11% of segment members reported lower levels of life
satisfaction at the time of the survey.

9
Segment 4 – Outside "Bubble"-Averse (18% representing 5.6 million adult
Canadians), Segment Motto: "I Am Sticking to My Bubble!"
Members of this older segment are mostly worried about being infected in places and/or
social occasions taking place outside their respective household "bubbles". A “bubble” is
an unofficial term used in Canada to describe people with whom the individual feels
comfortable spending time during the pandemic (e.g. the household). Like members of
population segments 2 and 5, Outside "Bubble"-Averse individuals experience anxiety
over virus contagion, particularly in regard to the issue of providing care of individuals
living outside the household (3.61 score points average ). Visit to retirement homes is
also another important source of reported anxiety. Two third of segment members (66%)
were married and/or lived with a common-law partner while 44% reported home as their
main work location. The Outside "Bubble"-Averse constitute the most educated
population segment: about a third of them (34%) had a diploma equivalent to a
university bachelor’s degree or above. One in ten of them (10%) reported low levels of life
satisfaction at the time of the survey
Segment 5 – Nursing Homes-Averse (24% representing 7.5 Adult Canadians),
Segment Motto: "I Will Not Visit Grandma Today!"
At the time of the survey, one in four Canadians can be described as Nursing HomesAverse type of individuals 7. Although generally anxious about COVID-19 virus
infections in various places or social situations like members of segments 1, 2 and 4,
they are particularly worried about visiting family and/or relatives residing in nursing
homes (3.37 score points average ). Despite their altruistic motivations, these activities
are seen as highly "risky" for this population segment 8. . Members of the Nursing
Homes-Averse segment were almost equally divided in terms of gender and more than
two-thirds (69%) were married or living with a common law partner (69%). About 44%
reported home as their work location while 16% of them displayed a low level of life
satisfaction.

7
At the time of the survey, Ontario and other provinces were tackling outbreaks in nursing homes and
attempting to reopen visitations. Also, the Canadian army was called to assist nursing home residents, see:
https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-ontario-to-allow-family-visits-to-nursing-homes-that-arefree-of-covid/
.
8
Given the time persistence of virus outbreaks in nursing homes, it is expected that this population segment
will be observable during the various phases of the pandemic in Canada.

5.0. Reflections
One major contribution market segmentation analysis like the one carried-out here is the
discovery of hidden behavioural patterns and the ability to link statistical methods to the
monitoring of outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. A statistical portrait
of COVID-19 virus infection fears using marketing segmentation techniques can help
federal, regional and local decision makers to better identify universal market segments
and tailor segment-suited interventions. Rather than “one size fits all” results, public
health programs and activities can be developed for each population cluster and provide
tools that can change perceptions and develop more effective responses to tackle positive
and negative outcomes in the always-changing COVID-19 confinement environment.
It should be noted that the available public version of the CPSS-Series3 survey,
regrettably, did not contain provincial or territorial breakdowns and was limited to
individual reporting during the “first” phase of the pandemic (June, 2020). In the
"second" and subsequent phases of the pandemic, shifts in the share of segment
composition are likely to occur and so it is desirable to produce a larger longitudinal
picture. Frequent surveys carried out by Statistics Canada and other data collection
agencies are desirable and may yield important information on the common transitions
of individuals from one cluster to another.
In this study, five population segments were clearly identified using a combination of
principal component and k-means cluster statistical analysis of members of the first four
segments (Germophobes, Crowd-Averse, Fearless, Outside "Bubble"-Averse and Nursing
Homes-Averse). Regardless of place, circumstance and/or activity, the Germophobes
were extremely fearful of contracting the virus while members of the Fearless segment, a
polar opposite, underestimated health risks and carried on with their lives with minor
preoccupations. Crowd-Averse, Outside "Bubble"-Averse and Nursing Homes-Averse
segment members showed differences in terms of the foci of COVID-19 potential
infections. A higher level of fear and anxiety of contracting COVID-19 infections can lead
to negative outcomes such as mental health deterioration and low personal efficacy (see
for instance the work of Zajacova et. al (2020) with CPSS Series1 data). However, the same
fear may also lead to positive outcomes for individuals such as a greater emphasis on
personal care and a stricter application of sanitary guidelines and personal security in
both public and private spaces.
In light of the present findings, a deeper investigation of behavioural outcomes in each
population segment is desirable. In the case of the Germophobe, Outside "Bubble"Averse and Nursing Homes-Averse groups, it is important to know how their perceived
virus infection risks balance out with that of their altruistic motivations to take of care of
others. The Crowd-Averse segment is exemplary in terms of following the enacted
sanitary guidelines. This investigation of outcomes also applies to the Fearless segment
as well whose "self-confident" members may be at greater risk of negligence in following
the safety guidelines. Given their unique perceptual profiles, public health messages will
be more efficient if their messages pay special attention to the particular sociodemographic, residential, employment and psychosocial characteristics of segment
members.
