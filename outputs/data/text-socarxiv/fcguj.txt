Abstract:
We present findings from the first two waves of an innovative, population-representative,
UK time-use diary survey conducted both pre- and mid-lockdown, using an online diary
instrument that proved both reliable and quick-to-field. Combining diary information on
activity, location, and co-presence to estimate infection risks associated with daily
behavior, we show clear changes in such behavior related to infection risk between the
pre and mid-lockdown periods: a substantial reduction of time spent in those behaviors
with the highest levels of risk, accompanied by an equivalent increase in low-risk
behavior. Because, in general, a populations’ time use changes relatively slowly, the
behavioral changes revealed may be interpreted directly as a consequence of the UK
COVID-19 ‘lockdown’ regulations. Subsequent waves will reveal the behavioral
consequences of future changes in regulation.

A new perspective in understanding the effects of lockdown on COVID-19 behavioral
infection risk
Governments around the world are urgently redesigning social distancing measures as
they assess the trade-offs between economic and psychological distress and the need to
avoid a resurgence in COVID-19. At a time when there is still limited capacity in respect
both of immunization and track-trace technology, policy-makers must continue to rely on
changes in people’s daily behaviors to contain the virus. We present a tool enabling
policy-makers to assess and quantify changes in the daily infection risk-related
behaviors following social restrictions, and the impact they are having on overall risk
levels. Using an innovative time-use diary survey conducted in real time during the
period of peak lockdown, this paper provides a new view of the changing levels of
behavioral risk pre- and during lockdown.
Many aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic are still poorly understood. But it is clear that
the effective means of transmission of infection is contact: close interaction of an
uninfected individual with an infected individual or location (1). Demographic
characteristics—age, sex, other social or environmental characteristics—are often used
to model the heterogeneity of contact (2,3,4). But these characteristics are less
proximate to the routes of infection than are the daily patterns of behavior with which
they are associated. Contact-based studies (5,6), ask respondents who they met during
specific periods (e.g. ‘yesterday’ or ‘between these times’), or (for the GPS-driven BBC
Pandemic Survey) while they were in a defined area over a 1-hour period (7). While they
record the physical proximity of contact (such as the speaking/touching distinction),
contact-based surveys do not typically provide much information on the specific
locations in which these contacts occurred, or on the likelihood that respondents were
surrounded by people other than those they describe as ‘contacts’ (e.g. on a train, or in
the cinema), or about activities/locations during which respondents did not report being
in contact with specific others.
We bring to the study of the behavioral transmission of risk a new conceptual and
methodological approach—from the perspective of time use research. The
comprehensive 24-hour records of changing activities contained in 2 successive timeuse diary surveys during the pre- and mid-lockdown periods reveal which behaviors
(activities and locations and co-presences) were substituted under lockdown for prelockdown behavior (for example, lower-risk time at home substituting for higher-risk time
at the workplace), enabling a picture of the changes in behavioral transmission risk
associated with lockdown to be constructed.
Time-use diary data has been extensively deployed over many decades to understand
trends in daily behavior (8, 9,10). Time-use diary surveys provide nationallyrepresentative samples of comprehensive, continuously-registered, records about the
activities of daily life, including detail on their location and social context, through every
10 minutes of a 24 hour (or longer) period. Comparisons with objective activity measures
(worn cameras, accelerometers) suggest that time-use diaries provide generally reliable
and unbiased records of activity sequences and durations (11). Deploying time-use
diary evidence in this context has been done previously (12,13,14), but not in respect of
2

combining multiple diary fields (activities, locations, co-presence and durations) to
estimate risks, and not to report changing behavioral infection risks pre- and midlockdown.
Time-use diary surveys are generally accompanied by individual and household
questionnaires, enabling detailed analysis by socio-economic and demographic
characteristics to explore the distributional correlates and consequences of daily activity
patterns. These questionnaires also provide information on aspects of time-use not
covered by the diaries: for example monthly frequency of participation in various
activities, permitting estimation of longer-term distributions of time across populations
(15); and questions on child-care arrangements, and on happiness, life satisfaction,
health and wellbeing.
Materials and Methods
In 2016 the Centre for Time Use Research (together with the Dynata survey Agency and
the Trajectory Partnership research Consultancy), developed a new online Click and
Drag Diary Instrument (CaDDI), collecting population-representative (quota sample) from
a market research panel across 9 developed countries including the UK and the USA
(16). We were able to field the same instrument with a similar UK sample, in May-June
2020 - at the peak period of lockdown, providing a real-time comparison with 2016
behavior. Diaries were collected on 2 or 3 days per respondent (including one weekday
and one weekend day) per respondent, yielding approximately 1,000 diaries in each
survey.
The quota samples were selected from a pre-existing panel to represent the UK
population age >17, and reweighted to provide correct distributions of days-of-the-week
and to correspond approximately to national population structures. Response days (2 or
3 per respondent; including one weekday and one weekend day) were randomly
allocated to respondents. The two final samples included 1000 days in 2016, and 1005
in 2020. Response quality was comparable to other on-line diaries, with a mean of 17
distinct episodes recorded each day, and with unusually low levels of missing primary
activity, location and co-presence data.
The CaDDI proved cheap to administer and relatively non-burdensome for respondents
(with a mean 15-minute, median 12-minute, collection time). New waves of data
collection using the same methodology are quick to commission (our May-June 2020
data collection took less than a fortnight from first consideration to enter the field).
The original instrument was also deployed (in 2016) in eight other developed countries
(USA, France, Italy, Germany, Sweden, The Netherlands, Finland and Spain) with a total
of 6000 individual respondents, most completing two diary days. The whole 2016 sample
consists of 10,024 days collected between November 2015 and May 2016.

Methods
Taking cognisance of the epidemiological literature on contact risks, the estimates of risk
levels we used were based on combinations of activity type, location and co-presence.
We combined records of activity (36 categories), co-presence (7 categories, with up to
four categories recorded simultaneously), location (3 categories), and duration, to
estimate different levels of risk of infection for each 10-minute period through the day.
The literature on transmission considers time at home alone or with members of the
same household as lowest-risk, with the main focus for transmission of infection being
contact with non-household members inside or outside the home. The virus is more
likely to be transmitted indoors, in crowds, and through personal contact of over 15
minutes (17,18). Our risk estimates located each activity/ location/ co-presence/duration
combination in one of five risk-level categories ordered from low to high.
Our estimates of riskiness of location and co-presence status vary according to the
activity—sometimes reflecting the nature of the activity itself (e.g. cinema implies the
presence of other, non-household, individuals), and sometimes influenced by its
characteristic location (e.g. indoors, enclosed, vs open-air). The multiple diary fields for
each episode aid the risk-assignment process. For example, co-presence information
may be supplemented from the activity fields, so “using public transport” can be taken to
imply current or recent presence of other, non-household, individuals, while “childcare”
implies presence of children. Registered activity may directly indicate risk: “jogging”, for
example, implying a low risk open-air location, “at the cinema”, an enclosed space.
The resulting estimates of risk accompanying the activity/co-presence/location
combinations are shown in Table 1. Activities are shown grouped into categories that
have similar patterns of risk attribution across the location and co-presence fields. The
main two columns show ‘in home’ and ‘away from home’ location categories, each
grouped into two co-presence categories: alone or with household members; with other,
non-household members.

We then, following the suggestion of de Cao et al. (17), took account of the duration of
events, assigning activities of only one 10-minute timeslot to the lowest risk level (level
1). This leads to only a small number of changes in our risk assignments.
Table A1 of the Appendix provides a look-up table for setting out the detailed
composition of the nine activity/copresence/location categories shown in Figure 1, based
on the activity number and column number information shown in Table 1.

Findings
Figure 1 presents change in behavior related to infection risk between the 2016 survey,
and that conducted in May-June 2020. It shows historical change in both minutes per
day, and daily participation rates, in the different combined activity/location/co-presence
categories in the UK before and during the COVID-19 lockdown.
The pair of vertical colored stacked bars show the average minutes per day in nine
groups of activity/location/co-presence combinations ordered, bottom to top, by risk
level. The left-hand column refers to the 2016 pre-lockdown pattern, the right to lateMay/early-June 2020. The horizontal bars on either side of the figure show the daily
percentage of the sample engaging in each of the activity types at each time-point.
The changes following lockdown can be clearly seen. In particular, we observe the shift
from more to less risky combinations of activity/location/co-presence categories during
lockdown: the 71% of the day devoted to the least-risky category 1 activities in 2016
increases to 87% of the day in late May-early June 2020; and the 22% of the day spent
in the most-risky (category 5) activities in 2016 decreases to 6%. At the bottom of both
stacked columns the average daily time spent at home alone or with other household
members doing self-care activities (including sleep, personal toilet, and meals),
increases from 608 to 678 minutes, unpaid work tasks (cooking, cleaning, child-care,
household maintenance), from 101 to 132 minutes, home leisure activities, and paid
home working from 268 to 319 and 42 to 129 respectively. As we read up the column,
risk category 2 includes activities such as leisure done away from home, but alone or
with household members in open spaces (77 to 64 minutes), while risk category 3
includes activities such as leisure or caring done away from home in closed spaces,
alone or with other household members (declining from 36 to 26 minutes). Risk category
4 comprises at home activities done with others not from the same household (23 to 8
minutes), and in the highest risk category, activities done away from home (such as
leisure or care-giving) with others not from the same household, and paid work at the
workplace, decline from 92 to 22 and 174 to 57 minutes respectively.

6

7

Participation rates (horizontal bars) change similarly. The percentage engaging in the
least risky (level 1) activities on any day increase between 2016 and May/June 2020, as
do the sample members’ rates of participation in them. As we move up the horizontal
bars, the more-risky activities show continuously declining rates of participation. Away
from home caring for non-household members declines from 53% to 20% on a random
day, while paid work or study away from home declines from 41% to 15%.
Populations’ time use patterns change, in normal times, only very slowly. So despite the
4-year distance from the earlier observation window, these unusually large historical
changes in behavior may reasonably be interpreted as arising, mainly, from changes
resulting from lockdown regulations in the UK.
Discussion
Recognizing that the risk of infection by COVID-19 is unlikely to disappear in the near
future, it is likely that governments will need to continue to impose new restrictions on
behavior (whether locally or nationally). In these circumstances it is imperative that
policy-makers are provided with tools to be able to assess and quantify changes in the
risk-related behaviors that follow these restrictions, and the impact they are having on
risk levels. These survey waves provide an innovative view of behavioral changes in
daily life as it relates to risk of infectious transmission. The continuous and
comprehensive data provided by time-use diaries provides a more complete record of
daily behavior, complementing contact-based instruments derived particularly from
Polymod (5,6). We will continue to record the changing pattern of daily behavior
associated with new phases of the COVID-19 social regulation process (starting with a
new tranche of data collection in late July 2020).
The CaDDI instrument, which is capable of rapid deployment for real-time measurement
of behavioral change, opens up a further wide range of potential future applications:
•

Beyond the measurement of the riskiness of behavior on average, the
accompanying CaDDI questionnaire information allows analysis of the
distribution of the behavioral risk of social distancing measures, enabling, for
example, a cross-time assessment of distributional change by gender (19,20), or
by occupation.
The CaDDI diary includes, in addition to the activity, co-presence and location
diary fields deployed in this report, an additional field registering use of ICT
devices, enabling investigation of how use of these technologies is changing
among different groups of respondents over the course of social restrictions
imposed in response to the pandemic.
It also includes an instantaneous “how much did you enjoy the activity?” diary
field, which can be used, in conjunction with the extensive questionnaire
evidence about respondents’ physical and mental health and wellbeing (available
from the GHQ12 items of the accompanying questionnaire), to explore the
subjective consequences of lockdown; for example, behavioral fatigue.

The estimates of risk, particularly in relation to physical contact, can be validated
and supplemented using empirical evidence from the CTUR’s collection of nearly
200 days of combined diary, body-camera and accelerometer evidence (21).
This evidence, (with photographs at approximately 45 second intervals
throughout the diary day) allows direct observation of the physical proximity of
the diarists to others. In addition, occupation-specific risk to time at the workplace
(based on the O*NET data adapted by the ONS to UKSOC), enables an extra
layer of detail to be added to the existing risk classification (22).
The 2016 CaDDI survey provided similar information from 8 other countries
(including the USA) opening the opportunity for low-cost cross-national pre- and
post-COVID-19 research. There are also many larger-scale time use diary
datasets, designed and collected by National Statistical Institutes, providing the
potential for cross-national and historical comparisons, and for validation
purposes (although their traditional large-scale survey design precludes
deployment during pandemic conditions). The American Time Use Survey, and
national surveys from the HETUS provide up-to-date (though longer to field)
time-use datasets, as well as substantial legacy data for historical comparison.
The Multinational Time Use Study archive includes harmonized versions of data
from 25 (mostly developed) countries (23).
