Abstract
The outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led countries to implement measures to prevent its
spread. One of these measures included shutting down schools and universities. Consequently, the
teaching, learning and assessment processes were entirely shifted from face-to-face to online. The current
study aimed to investigate online vocabulary learning strategies (VLSs) amid COVID-19 pandemic used
by Saudi EFL students. It attempted to find out the online strategies Saudi EFL astudents use to get the
meaning of new vocabulary, the strategies they use to study new vocabulary and the strategies they follow
to revise the learned vocabulary and keep them as part of their repertoire. The sample of the study was
119 male and female English and non-English majors. The study modified Kulikova's (2015)
questionnaire. This study was conducted at the University of Bisha, Saudi Arabia, during a fully online
learning period in September and October 2020 at the time of COVID-19 outbreak. The data were
collected via a self-administered questionnaire form. It was distributed via teachers of the English
Department. The study found out that English majors used vocabulary learning strategies more than nonEnglish majors. It also showed that students do not ask their teachers about the meaning of new
vocabulary (77%), they also do not ask their classmates (92%), nor they ask their friends (85%), which
could be attributed to online study and due to social distance during coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).

1. Introduction
In order to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it was rational to
close the institutes of education globally (Mahyoob, 2020; Syahrin & Salih 2020). As a result,
schools and universities in Saudi Arabia transferred entirely online. Studying via different
learning management systems such as Blackboard, Moodle, Zoom, Cisco, YouTube, Instagram,
etc., force learners to learn new vocabulary that enhances vocabulary acquisition and allow
students to practice them (Dincer, 2020). Mobile phones, online games, and blended learning
were found as a good opportunity for students to acquire new vocabulary (Mahdi, 2018; Al
Masri, 2020 & Bin-Hady, 2021).
It is a complex process to learn vocabulary through formal instruction as it is influenced
by several factors such as the teacher’s attitude towards the notion of acquiring vocabulary and
the students' readiness to learn vocabulary. Vocabulary learning is also influenced by the
interaction of other factors such as the linguistic features of vocabulary; mother tongue and
second/foreign language interference; the nature of vocabulary development; the ability of
memory to encode, store, and then recall acquired or learned vocabulary; development of the
second language (L2) mental lexicon and its organization; vocabulary input; individual
differences; the teacher and teaching strategies; presentation of new words; and integration of
lexical items in the mental lexicon (Takac, 2008). Vocabulary acquisition is also affected by
learning strategies followed by learners. Yunhao (2011) put it: ''The use of vocabulary learning
strategies is one crucial factor that affects the success of foreign vocabulary acquisition'' (p. 1).
English Vocabulary is important for English learners to listen, speak, read and write.
Without vocabulary, English students cannot comprehend listening and reading skills and cannot
produce any writing and speaking activity. It is found that English as a foreign language (EFL)
learners who study English at schools cannot adequately express themselves neither in speaking
nor in writing (Al-Nasser, 2015). Therefore, the current study is going to investigate the VLSs
used by EFL students while studying English online. It attempts to answer the following
questions:
1. What are the most and least VLSs used by EFL students during COVID-19
outbreak?
2. Is there a significant difference concerning the use of strategies between English
and non-English majors?
3. Is there a significant difference with regard to the use of strategies between higher
and lower GPA students?
2. Review of Literature
Recent studies, during the breakout of COVID-19, on Saudi students' VLSs have been
conducted. Alghamdi and Elyas (2020) proved the positive effect of electronic flashcards on
promoting learners' vocabulary. Alhadiah (2020) demonstrated a positive attitude towards the
use of Quizlet program for learning vocabulary. Alamer (2020) examined the influence of
Blackboard (Bb) on vocabulary acquisition. The study showed that Bb had a little effect on the
performance of King Khalid University (KKU) students in vocabulary learning. Alharthi, Bown
and Pullen (2020) reviewed the literature concerning the use of social media platforms for
learning vocabulary. They found that out of 50 studies, only fifteen were relevant to using social
media platforms for vocabulary learning. It has been acknowledged that social media platforms

are effective in the development of vocabulary. Concerning VLSs used by undergraduate
students, Alahmad (2020) found that Saudi female undergraduate English major students used
seventeen strategies, out of which nine cognitive and five metacognitive with high frequency in
the vocabulary learning process. Her study also revealed that they used twenty-eight and ten
strategies with medium and low frequencies, respectively. A similar study by Al-Khresheh and
Al-Ruwaili (2020) proved that the most and the least preferable strategies used by the Saudi
undergraduate learners were memory and cognitive strategies, respectively.
a. Vocabulary Learning Strategies
Many researchers and theorists provide definitions of learning strategies. Oxford (1990)
call them ''actions'' that learners use to facilitate the learning process (as cited in Macaro, 2001,
p.17) . Cohen (2014) defined language learning strategies as ''thoughts and actions, consciously
chosen and operationalized by language learners, to assist them in carrying out a multiplicity of
tasks from the very onset of learning to the most advanced levels of target-language
performance'' (p. 7). Learning strategies, as defined by O'Malley and Chamot (1990), refer to
''the special thoughts or behaviors that individuals use to help them comprehend, learn, or retain
new information'' (p. 1). Prior to these definitions, Rubin (1975) had offered a comprehensive
definition of learning strategies as "the techniques or devices which a learner may use to acquire
knowledge” (p. 43). Therefore, language learning strategies can be described as a set of methods,
techniques, actions, steps, thoughts, or behaviors that learners use to facilitate the learning
process.
VLSs can be regarded as an integral part of language learning. They refer to all “actions
that learners take to help themselves understand and remember vocabulary” Cameron (as cited in
Yunhao, 2011, p. 7). According to Oxford (2017) ''L2 vocabulary learning strategies are
teachable, dynamic thoughts and behaviors that learners consciously select and employ in
specific contexts to improve their self-regulated, autonomous L2 vocabulary development for
effective task performance and long-term proficiency'' (p. 244). Learning a word doesn't mean
knowing its meaning only. According to Hurd and Lewis (2008), it is a cumulative process that
depends on identifying the word's form, meaning, and its usage in different circumstances.
Hatch and Brown (2000) explained five steps to learning new words: encountering the
word, identifying the word form, identifying its meaning, associating the word form to its
meaning, and using it. From the point of view of VLS use, Schmitt (2000) classified VLSs into
two main categories: strategies for the discovery of new word meaning and others for
consolidating a new word meaning after it has been discovered. The former category subsumes
two subcategories, determination strategies, and social strategies. The latter category includes
social strategies, memory strategies, cognitive strategies, and metacognitive strategies. O'Malley
and Chamot (1990) classified language learning strategies used by foreign language students into
three categories: metacognitive strategies, cognitive strategies, and social/affective strategies.
Concerning strategies used for learning vocabulary.
On the basis of Ming Wei's (2007) classification of strategies, Yunhao (2011) listed
seven VLSs: dictionary use, guessing, perceptions, encoding, activation, management, and
sources. VLSs are important for vocabulary learning and acquisition Takac (2008).

On the basis of VLSs proposed by Schmitt (2000), Khair (2017) investigated VLSs used
by Sudanese English major students at the University of Al-Fashir. The study revealed that using
VLSs had a positive effect on the development of vocabulary. It also showed that metacognitive
strategies were most frequently used (75%) by the participants and then cognitive strategies.
However, social strategies were the least used by them. Patahuddin, Syawal, and Taher (2017)
verified strategies employed by learners of junior high school in Parepare, Indonesia, for
enhancing their English vocabulary. The results of the study showed that learners used different
methods such as dictionaries, reading English books and advertisements, playing games, the
internet, listening to songs, and watching movies to acquire vocabulary. Alqarni (2018)
conducted a study on the impact of training students to raise their awareness of VLSs. The
participants were 29 Saudi male English majors in the College of Languages and Translation at
King Saud University. The results of the study showed the impact of this training in the
increased use of VLSs by the participants and their use in reading and grammar courses as well.
To explore the development of vocabulary by using WhatsApp, Bensalem (2018) conducted a
study at Northern Borders University in Saudi Arabia. Forty students participated in the study.
They were divided into two groups, experimental and control. The experimental group was asked
to use the new vocabulary in sentences and submit their assignments via WhatsApp, and the
control group was asked to submit hard copies of their assignments. The results of the study
showed that the experimental group, which also proved a positive attitude for learning
vocabulary via WhatsApp, outperformed the control group in the vocabulary test. Yaacob et al.
(2019) explored the use of VLSs by students at Saudi School Malaysia. The findings of the study
revealed that the participants used five stages of strategies (encountering the new word, getting
the word form, getting the word meaning, consolidating word form and meaning in memory, and
finally using the word) at a medium level and almost at a close range.
Other studies on the use of VLSs by students of other academic majors were conducted.
Seddigh and Shokrpour's study (2012) investigated the use of VLSs by medical students and
found out that guessing and dictionary strategies were the most frequently used strategies while
social and study preference were the least used by the subjects of the study. This is not in line
with Hashemi and Hadavi's (2015) study, which investigated the use of VLSs by students of
Medical Sciences at Rafsanjan University. The results of the study showed that 57.6% of the
participants used dictionaries. Guessing and social strategies were the most used strategies.
However, autonomy and note-taking strategies had the least obtained scores. The results also
showed significant differences pertaining to students' majors. Social strategies were more
frequently used by paramedical and nursing students, while study preference and selective
attention strategies were used by medical and dentistry students. Female students preferred social
strategies, but males used autonomy and note-taking strategies more. Boonnoon, (2019) explored
the use of VLSs by students of four different academic majors (Business, Engineering,
Agriculture and Health Science) at a comprehensive university in the northeast of Thailand and
examined if there was a significant difference in strategy use pertaining to their academic major.
The results of her study revealed a significant difference in the use of five categories - study
preferences, selective attention, autonomy, social, and memory. However, the results did not
show any significant difference for the other three categories (guessing, dictionary and notetaking) among the participants. The results also proved that health science students used VLSs
more frequently than others.

Being acquainted with vocabulary is vitally important for acquiring second and foreign
languages and mastering receptive and productive language skills (Viera, 2017). Vocabulary
knowledge is vitally important for language comprehension and production (Seddigh &
Shokrpour, 2012; Patahuddin, Syawal & Taher, 2017). VLSs play an essential role in developing
the four language skills (Patahuddin, Syawal & Taher, 2017; Boonkongsaen, 2012). Without
sufficient vocabulary knowledge, learners cannot communicate. According to Oxford (2017)
''grammatical competence is needed, along with competence in using vocabulary, for optimal
communication'' (p. 243). Yaacob et al. (2019) said, ''In all linguistic skills, vocabulary takes its
role in developing a student's language proficiency'' (p. 3). Boonnoon (2019) stated, ''To master
the language, learners need to pay utmost attention to all details pertaining to the language
knowledge including grammatical structure, vocabulary, and register'' (p. 902). Learning
vocabulary is considered as the most urgently required thing that people need to learn another
language (Laufer & Sim 1985, as cited in Hashemi & Hadavi, 2015). Khan, Radzuan, Shahbaz,
Ibrahim and Mustafa (2018) conducted a study on the role of vocabulary knowledge in the
development of speaking skills which revealed that vocabulary knowledge and speaking
proficiency are strongly correlated. Learners who know VLSs find it easy to learn new
vocabulary because VLSs facilitate the learning process of new vocabulary (Boonkongsaen,
2012). Adam (2016) undertook a study on the role of VLSs in the development of learners'
performance which proved the necessity of having a good stock of vocabulary for language skills
mastery. In addition, vocabulary teaching and learning strategies promote both learners' writing
and communication abilities.
Thus, one of the main factors as to why language learners might not be able to
communicate is their insufficient vocabulary knowledge that can be regarded as the crucial need
to improve their language proficiency. The wider the vocabulary, the more proficient learners
are.
c. Factors Affecting Vocabulary Acquisition
Boonkongsaen (2012) discussed twelve factors that affect learners' VLS use: belief,
attitude, motivation, and language learning experience; the field of study, course type, class
level, gender, and language learning environment; language achievement, language proficiency,
and vocabulary knowledge. She categorized them into three main categories: learners' individual
differences that include the first four factors, situational and social factors that cover the next
five, and learners' learning outcome, which encompasses the last factors. You (2011) conducted a
study on factors that contribute to vocabulary acquisition while reading. Her study revealed that
factors such as explanation, repetition, and translation into L1 are significantly more effective for
vocabulary acquisition. Other factors such as marginal glosses and dictionary use help learners
acquire meanings of new words. In addition, factors like additional oral and visual inputs affect
the retention of new words positively. She found out that learners vary in their vocabulary
acquisition due to individual differences such as motivation and language proficiency.
Yaacob et al. (2018) proved that motivation is one of the most significant factors that
affect vocabulary learning among Saudi students at Saudi School in Malaysia. It also showed
that learners' attitudes and beliefs and learning environment also affect vocabulary learning. A
leaning environment motivates students to have a positive attitude towards learning English. LinFang (2013) studied the factors that affect students' use of VLSs at Fooyin University in Taiwan.

Motivation was proved to have the greatest effect on VLS. Proficient learners with high
motivation participated more than students with low motivation in self-initiated learning
activities. Learners whom their family members tutored showed more proficiency than others.
The study showed that the effort spent on learning didn't affect VLS. According to Knez (2018)
learners' perceptions influenced VLS. In other words, learners who think that English is easy to
use more incidental VLS. However, gender and level of education do not affect vocabulary
choice.
Our study is different from the studies mentioned in the literature with regard to its focus
on VLSs by Saudi undergraduate learners amid the outbreak of COVID-19, which none of these
recent studies have touched upon.
3. Methodology
This section is dedicated to present the methodology that is followed to conduct the
current study.
a. Participants
The sample of the study consists of 119 students from the University of Bisha, Saudi
Arabia. The participants are English majors (79) and non-English majors(40) who study English
online during COVID-19 outbreak. Forty-six participants are male and 73 are female. The
students' GPA was one of the variables of the study. The background information of participants
is presented in the following table.

b. Instruments and Data collection
The researchers distributed a questionnaire on vocabulary learning strategies to the
students of English. The questionnaire was of two sections. The first section was a background
information. It elicits students, gender, GPA and levels. The second section used Kulikova's
(2015) modified questionnaire. It was divided into three categories: the strategies that students
use to get the meaning of new vocabulary, the strategies that learners use to study new
vocabulary and the strategies that learners follow to revise vocabulary to keep them in their
repertoire. Before distributing the questionnaire, it was sent in an online form to 9 university
teachers to referee them. Then they were asked to write their suggestions for modification if
suggested. The questionnaire was finally updated according to the comments given by referees.

To avoid the questions' misunderstanding, the questionnaire was translated into Arabic and
distributed to students in English and Arabic.
The questionnaire was designed in Google Format and the link was sent to the
chairperson of the English Department. He sent the link to the English teachers' group in
Telegram in September 2020, requesting them to distribute it to their students. The students were
informed that the questionnaire is for research purpose and it will be confidential. They were also
informed that they would not get or lose any mark because of responding to the questionnaire.
The participants were not asked to write their names in the questionnaire to avoid the bias
responses.
c. Data Analysis
SPSS package 24 was used to analyze the frequencies and percentages of vocabulary
learning strategies followed by English and non-English majors. It was also used to analyze the
Chi-Square to find out the significant differences between the study variables.
4. Results and Discussion
To answer the research questions of the current study, the students' responses were
analyzed, presented and discussed in this section.
4.1 Vocabulary strategies used to get the meaning of new vocabulary
The only significant difference between English-majors and non-English majors was that
English majors were more likely to rely on a bilingual dictionary (Chi-square = 8.10, p<.005) as
shown in Table 2.

However, Table 3 displays the students' frequencies and percentages when trying to get
the meaning of a new word. Looking at the raw numbers, English majors were less likely to ask a
classmate (8%) than others (13%) and more likely to use all other strategies than non-English
majors. This suggests that English majors have a wider range of strategies for finding the
meaning of a new word than do non-English majors. For non-English majors, the most-used
strategy was to guess the meaning from context (53%), a strategy that was also common for
English majors (65%). However, the most common strategy for English majors was to look up
the word in a bilingual dictionary (73%), a strategy used less frequently by non-English majors
(45%). Another interesting result is that only 24% of English-majors use monolingual
dictionaries (English-English dictionaries). This is in line with Alhaisoni (2020) who found that
bilingual dictionary is the most used one and monolingual dictionary is less frequent.. However,
73% of the English-majors use bilingual dictionary. This might indicate the students' keenness to
know the meaning in their native language.

words. Writing rather than orally repeating seems to be a strategy more often used by English
majors though it does not show any significant difference between the English and the nonEnglish majors.

Table 6 shows a significant difference between high grade and low-grade students regarding
connecting new words to their synonyms and/or antonyms. Students with high GPA are more
likely to use this strategy than students with low GPA, Chi-Square = 6.85, p<.02. This item
showed that students with high GPA have enough vocabulary in their repertoire, allowing them
to connect the learned words to synonyms and antonyms, but students with low GPA do not have
enough vocabulary to follow this strategy.

4.3 Vocabulary strategies used to make the learned vocabulary part of students' repertoire
Table 7 shows the strategies used to make the learned vocabulary part of the students' repertoire.
The results show that there is no significant difference among the variables (major/non-major,
male/female, and high grade/low grade) in this regard.
Looking at the raw numbers, it is clear that the English and non-English majors' strategies
are similar. The only strategy that shows higher frequency than others is the use of the learned
vocabulary in their speaking and writing. The other strategies are not commonly used by the
majority of either the English or the non-English majors. This might lead to the inability of
students to use appropriate vocabulary in their performance.

5. Conclusion and Recommendation
The current study aimed to investigate online vocabulary learning strategies used by Saudi EFL
students who study English at the University of Bisha, Saudi Arabia, during COVID-19
outbreak. The current study results showed that English majors used vocabulary learning
strategies to get the meaning of the new vocabulary and study the learned vocabulary.
Concerning strategies to make the learned vocabulary as part of their repertoire, the study did not
find significant differences among the variables (major/non-major, high grade/low grade, and
male/female). Students reported that they did not highly use strategies of asking teachers,
classmates, and friends. However, they used bilingual dictionaries, Google Translate, or they
guessed the meaning. This might be attributed to online learning during the pandemic, which
encouraged self-learning. It was found that the students of English and non-English majors were

different with regard to using strategies to get the meaning of new vocabulary and to study them,
but not with regard to strategies to keep the learned ones as part of their repertoire.
The researchers recommend a further study to investigate the impact of online learning
on self-regulated learning as learning vocabulary online might enhance online self-regulated
learning. The researchers also recommend that EFL students be taught vocabulary learning
strategies in the university's first semester. Furthermore, they recommend that students be taught
how to use dictionaries and know what dictionaries provide users with.
