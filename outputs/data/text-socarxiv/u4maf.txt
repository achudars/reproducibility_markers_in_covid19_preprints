The article examines how many leaders used Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic, in what way, and the
impact they had on the public. In the context of Twitter, the impact on the public refers to the growth in followers
as it signiﬁes the increased interest of the public about information. 50,872 tweets were collected from 143 state
leaders and an original dataset was created containing information on the growth of followers. Ordinary least
squares regression models were used for the analysis. It was found that 64.8% of UN member states had a leader
that tweeted about COVID-19. Furthermore, a signiﬁcant increase in the number of followers during the pandemic
compared to months prior was noted. Since March, the pandemic has been a dominant topic on Twitter. During
the COVID-19 pandemic, the highest percentage increase in gaining Twitter followers was experienced by politicians who frequently tweeted and those who had a lower ratio of the number of followers to internet users. The
research implies that citizens are interested in being informed about emergencies through social networks, and
government ofﬁcials should use them.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by
the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020. COVID-19 is transmitted quite effectively and is primarily spread by contact transmission
and respiratory droplets (Gates, 2020; Kuca, 2020). State leaders had to
react to this situation and inform citizens about measures they should
take to prevent spreading COVID-19. They may, also, have wanted to
inform citizens about government measures. There are many ways to
inform the public. For example, leaders may choose to inform the public
via social networks, as it is an ideal way to inform people swiftly. Social
networks provide the possibility to inform the public in real-time about a
situation. In emergencies, such as the spread of COVID-19, it is crucial to
quickly inform the public. Twitter is a social network with 330 million
monthly active users (Statista, 2019). There is no doubt that some leaders
have used Twitter to inform the public. This article analyzes how many
leaders use Twitter to inform the public, how they use it, and how this use
may have impacted the public. More speciﬁcally, it is focused on the
growth of Twitter followers.
Several mass communication theories are used and applied to social
media (Sheldon, 2015). One of these theories is the uses and gratiﬁcations theory (UGT; Katz et al., 1973) that posits that people use certain

media depending on their needs. People want to fulﬁll their needs. Social
and psychological needs also differ for each individual and are affected
by different factors. In this study, Twitter is examined in times of crisis.
One would assume that during a health crisis people would be more information seeking. Casero-Ripolles (2020) conﬁrms that news consumption increased immensely during COVID-19. Igartua et al. (2020)
ﬁnd that high consumption of information about COVID-19 raises
perceived knowledge on the topic, and it results in the adoption of preventive measures. People can use Twitter as a source of news.
Parmelee and Bichard (2012) examine why people follow political
actors on Twitter. They ﬁnd that there are several motives for using
Twitter: convenience, entertainment, self-expression, guidance,
information-seeking, and social utility. These motives correspond with
the UGT. During the pandemic, several of these motives are present.
Twitter is a convenient platform for information as individuals only need
a mobile or computer screen. Guidance is important when individuals
need advice from relevant actors on how to act. For example, the
recommendation via Twitter from U. S. governors for residents to stay at
home greatly reduced the mobility of individuals during the COVID-19
pandemic (Grossman et al., 2020). Information-seekers can easily ﬁnd
out what government measures are in place to combat the pandemic and
the overall state of the country under the assumption that the

ﬁrst subsection presents mainly ﬁgures and tables about the usage of
Twitter during the pandemic by state leaders. Thus, it is focused on the
visual presentation of the activity of world leaders. In the second section,
the explanation about the growth rate of Twitter followers on leaders'
accounts is offered. Regression models were used to determine the reasons for the growth rate of Twitter followers. The third part discusses
contribution to theory and literature, implications to practice, limitations
and suggests avenues for future research. In the last part, the core ﬁndings are mentioned.

government account offers this information. The information obtained by
individuals has also a social utility as individuals then can discuss with
their family or friends what they learned from Twitter. Many studies have
conﬁrmed that certain users use Twitter primarily as an
information-seeking medium that fulﬁlls their need for information
(Hughes et al., 2012; Johnson and Yang, 2009). Of course, the UGT is not
used only with Twitter (Chen, 2011; Johnson and Yang, 2009), but
numerous studies have examined other social media such as Facebook
(Hollenbaugh and Ferris, 2014; Hunt et al., 2012; Sheldon, 2008; Smock
et al., 2011) or Instagram (Pittman and Reich, 2016; Sheldon and Bryant,
2016).
In recent years, research on political communication through Twitter
has become more prominent in social science research (Dang-Xuan et al.,
2013; Enli and Skogerbø, 2013; Jungherr, 2015, 2016). Twitter is an
important platform because policymakers can use its analytics to gain
insights (Joseph et al., 2017). Unsurprisingly, there has been research on
the adoption of social media by world leaders (Barbera and Zeitzoff,
2018). Also, it is important to examine communication on Twitter by
political leaders as the research on daily newspapers in Spain and Italy
has shown that the protagonists of the pandemic are especially politicians
(Tejedor et al., 2020). The research on the usage of Twitter during the
COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, but there have been already several
studies analyzing the impact of COVID-19 on Twitter usage.
Numerous studies have been published that examined spreading
misinformation on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic (Gruzd
and Mai, 2020; Lovari, 2020; Perez-Dasilva et al., 2020; Pulido et al.,
2020; Rodríguez et al., 2020; Vraga et al., 2020). For example, Pulido
et al. (2020) ﬁnd that false information about the pandemic is tweeted
more but retweeted less than science-based tweets. Bridgman et al.
(2020) ﬁnd that exposure to social media is linked with misperceptions
concerning basic facts about COVID-19. Two studies have been done on
the political polarization during the pandemic. In Canada, Merkley et al.
(2020) ﬁnd that the political elites and the public are in a time of
cross-partisan agreement on the important matters (for example social
distancing). On the contrary, in the United States, tweets are characterized by strong political polarization (Jiang et al., 2020). Several studies
have analyzed tweets and their content during the pandemic (Abd-Alrazaq et al., 2020; Budhwani and Sun, 2020; Jimenez-Sotomayor et al.,
2020; Park et al., 2020; Rao et al., 2020; Su et al., 2020; Thelwall and
Levitt, 2020), and others have used the sentiment analysis (Manguri
et al., 2020; Pastor, 2020; Toliyat, 2020). In China, Chen et al. (2020)
examine the importance of national government on social media by
analyzing citizen engagement through social media of Chinese central
agencies.
However, there has been only one study that examined state leaders
and their activity on Twitter and this was limited to the world leaders of
the Group of Seven (G7). The study shows, alongside other ﬁndings, that
world leaders of the G7 all use Twitter except Angela Merkel (Rufai and
Bunce, 2020). It may be beneﬁcial for world leaders to use Twitter during
crises and to gain followers that could become their potential supporters.
Support of governments has, on average, risen among populations during
the COVID-19 pandemic (Bol et al., 2020). Also, news consumption explains support for policies that seek to limit the spread of COVID-19
(Cilizoglu et al., 2020). Therefore, more information from relevant
government sources may help to improve citizens' compliance with
government actions.
This article is unique because a study has not yet been presented that
analyzes the global use of Twitter by state leaders and the public's reaction to it. Therefore, it is a signiﬁcant contribution to the literature that
examines the situation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The article is
divided into four main parts. The ﬁrst part offers information on the
methods used and has two subsections. The ﬁrst subsection concerns
with data collection and the second subsection explains regression
models. The second part presents the results with two subsections. The
ﬁrst subsection offers insights from social media analytics while the
second subsection shows insights from regression models. Therefore, the

2. Methods
In recent years, big data research and their challenges have been the
subject of literature (Abbasi et al., 2016; Fang et al., 2015; Kar and
Dwivedi, 2020). This study uses methodological approaches that are
based on big data. However, to combat challenges linked with big data
research, the study uses statistical techniques commonly used in social
science. Also, the study is connected to a theory that is often a problem
with big data studies.
2.1. Collection of Twitter data
Twitter API was used to create the original dataset of state leaders'
tweets. 50,872 tweets that were sent from 30 December 20191 to 7 May
2020 from 143 state leaders were collected and analyzed. The R package
rtweet (Kearney, 2018) was used to collect tweets. In this article, the term
“state leader” is deﬁned as either Head of State or Head of Government
with main executive power. Therefore, for example, monarchs with
ceremonial power or Presidents in parliamentary systems are not
included in the analysis.2 Furthermore, only what one may consider
personal Twitter accounts were analyzed, not the ofﬁce or press secretary
Twitter accounts. For example, in the case of Donald Trump, his personal
account @realDonaldTrump was used and not @POTUS or @WhiteHouse. In recent years, @realDonaldTrump has been the subject of many
studies (Lacatus, 2020; Perez-Curiel and Naharro, 2019; Yeste and
Franch, 2018). However, in some countries, it is not easy to distinguish
the Twitter account of politicians from the account used by the ofﬁce that
she or he represents. These differences may be signiﬁcant as politicians
keep their personal accounts while they lose access to the ofﬁce accounts
when they are defeated in elections and removed from the ofﬁce.
Moreover, personal accounts may have different dynamics as these accounts are used for campaigning while the ofﬁce accounts should remain
neutral. The collection of data about the Twitter accounts of world politicians was made easier by Twiplomacy (BCW, 2020). Twiplomacy
provides the database of politicians and world organizations and collects
the accounts on social media. Therefore, this website is a great help in the
political analysis of social media. However, all recorded accounts were
manually re-checked and veriﬁed whether unrecorded politicians do not
use Twitter. It was possible to collect all tweets through Twitter API.
However, Twitter does not offer information on the growth of followers
retrospectively. Therefore, data on the number of followers were
continuously collected for the majority of state leaders. Hence, it was
possible to use the information on the number of Twitter followers in the
past and calculate the growth. However, data for some accounts with a
small number of followers were not available as data on these state
leaders were not continuously collected. The study had available complete data regarding the growth of followers for more than 83% of

The ﬁrst calendar week in 2020 began on this date. No leader could inform
about COVID-19 before this date as the WHO ﬁrst tweeted about “a cluster of
pneumonia cases” in Wuhan on 4 January 2020.

However, in 10 cases, Presidents were also included when Prime Ministers
were not active if a President was and if they had more than 30,000 followers. In
many parliamentary systems, Presidents are directly elected. Therefore, their
role is not insigniﬁcant.

because this would mean that citizens would see Twitter as a new source
of information. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was not equal
across countries. Some countries were affected more heavily. Therefore,
some may assume that this could disproportionality affect the need for
information from citizens. The impact was measured as follows: the
number of conﬁrmed cases of COVID-19 as of 3 May 2020/population of
a country x 1,000,000. Here, the number of cases per one million people
was calculated. Furthermore, all variables, as all of them were heavily
skewed, were logged5.
Another important factor in the usage of Twitter is the language that
is used. Users tweeting in English may attract more attention. Therefore,
it is possible that leaders tweeting in global languages can have an
advantage in also gaining followers from other countries. This may be
particularly in the case of neighboring countries with the same language.
Citizens follow foreign leaders to see how the virus might have spread in
neighboring countries but also world leaders that use global language.
Therefore, four languages were chosen that might have a signiﬁcant
impact on the boosting of followers. These were English, Spanish, French,
and Arabic. Therefore, the fourth variable, language, is a categorical
variable. All other languages used by world leaders were included in the
group “other languages”. Even though there were languages that are
widely spoken in the group “other languages,” they were used only by a
few leaders6, and they did not seem to have properties (being used in
several neighboring countries or signiﬁcantly across the globe) that could
impact the signiﬁcant increase of followers. When state leaders used
more than one language, the language they used most frequently in their
tweets was chosen. In relation to models, ordinary least squares (OLS)
regression was used.

politicians including a collection of their tweets. Only partial data for
some politicians were available, but these data were sufﬁcient3 to include
them in regression models that are introduced in the following section.
2.2. Regression models – dependent and independent variables
The dependent variable is the growth of Twitter followers in percentage points from 27 January to 3 May 2020. This period was chosen
because it covers the outbreak of COVID-19 and the spread of conﬁrmed
cases around the world. At the beginning of May 2020, almost every
country had already put some measures in place to curb the spread of
COVID-19. Moreover, at that time, every state leader analyzed in this
study had already tweeted about the pandemic, as Figure 1 in the next
section shows. Therefore, the need for information was critical. Simply
put, if people were interested in being informed about the pandemic via
Twitter, it would make sense that they would follow a Twitter account of
a relevant state leader at the beginning of May 2020.
As it has been already mentioned, detailed information about the
growth rate of Twitter followers for all state leaders was not for the
purpose of study available. Furthermore, state leaders that took ofﬁce in
January 2020 and later were ﬁltered out because it would skew results as
one would expect there to be an increase of Twitter followers based on
their win. Also, leaders who did not mention COVID-19 on Twitter were
ﬁltered out. Therefore, in the regression models, 113 leaders from UN
member states were included. There may be various reasons that explain
the growth of Twitter followers. Four predictor variables were chosen.
The ﬁrst independent variable is the number of tweets4 from 27
January to 3 May 2020. In the models, tweets were not ﬁltered. Therefore, they may include also non-COVID tweets. However, COVID-19
pandemic was the main topic. Therefore, tweets related to the
pandemic dominated. Furthermore, original tweets and retweets were
distinguished. The ﬁrst model included all tweets and the second model
only original tweets. There are good reasons to distinguish tweets. First,
people usually follow more than one Twitter account. Therefore, it can be
expected that during the health crisis, citizens may follow Twitter accounts of a state leader, national government, health, and other relevant
authorities. If state leaders only retweet, there is a good chance that they
would retweet tweets from authorities that their Twitter followers
already follow. Therefore, their followers would not receive new original
information. Second, in general, the content of tweets may differ. For
example, based on content analysis of tweets during the 2009 H1N1
outbreak, Chew and Eysenbach (2010) ﬁnd that retweets contained
signiﬁcantly fewer tweets with personal experience compared to original
tweets. Third, at least some state leaders may consider original tweets
and retweets as a slightly different activity. Donald Trump, the most
followed state leader on Twitter, has been recently asked by NBC News
journalist about his retweet regarding a conspiracy theory about Joe
Biden. Trump responded, “That was a retweet, that was an opinion of
somebody, and that was a retweet. I'll put it out there, people can decide
for themselves, I don't take a position.” (Watson, 2020).
One may assume that the world leaders with greater Twitter activity
gain more followers than leaders who use Twitter very little. State leaders
with a very high number of followers are limited in the possibility of the
growth of Twitter followers. Therefore, this possibility was measured for
growth in the following way: number of followers as of 27 January 2020/
number of users of internet in the country x 100. Here, the ratio of the
number of followers to internet users was calculated as a percentage.
Data on internet usage in a country was provided by the International
Telecommunications Union (2019). One may expect that it would be
more likely that world leaders would gain more followers when the ratio
was fairly low, especially when leaders would use Twitter actively

3. Results
3.1. Insights from social media analytics
The ﬁrst insight from social media analytics concerns with the ﬁrst
mention of COVID-19 on Twitter. It is important to examine when the
state leaders ﬁrst mentioned COVID-19 on Twitter. To do this, several
keywords, such as “COVID,” “corona,” “virus”, were looked for within the
accounts of leaders. However, many leaders use a non-Latin script.
Therefore, the words coronavirus and virus were translated into all languages. After that, tweets found corresponded with COVID-19 were
manually re-checked. Leaders, by mentioning COVID-19 on Twitter,
acknowledge it as a signiﬁcant threat. However, not all leaders use
Twitter in the same fashion. While leaders who frequently use Twitter
might have informed people about the danger of COVID-19 when the
disease remained mostly in China and a few other countries, others
waited until they started putting security measures in place in their own
countries before they informed citizens. Therefore, how swift people
were informed about COVID-19 might differ signiﬁcantly. Table 17
shows leaders who informed the public already in January.
Figure 1 shows the percentage of leaders who tweeted about COVID19 across a timeline. It indicates that 64.8% of United Nations (UN)
member states had leaders that tweeted about COVID-19 as of 7 May
2020. Furthermore, the second line (blue) is drawn that offers information about conﬁrmed cases in the countries. The second line does not
refer to all (193) UN member states. It refers only to countries where
leaders tweeted about COVID-19. For clarity, the scales are the same.
Therefore, 64.8% conﬁrmed cases (blue line) signify that 100% of the

5
For the growth of followers, a constant (1.0036) was added to each number
before log transformation so the lowest value was positive and a log-transformed
number equal 0.
6
Of the languages included in the group “other languages”, Portuguese was
the most used by four leaders.
7
The creation date (GMT zone) of Tweets was used from the Twitter API.
Therefore, the time zone may not correspond to the leaders' time zones.

For regression models, it was sufﬁcient to have information on the growth of
followers from 27 January to 3 May 2020.

Tweets also include retweets.

on the availability of stop words for languages. Tweets, including deleting numbers, were processed to get the words. Also, words were
converted to lowercase. In the tweets, the most common language was
English followed by Spanish. Therefore, words from these languages
dominate. These four word clouds provide visual observation. The word
cloud of weeks 1–4 shows that there was no mention of COVID-19. The
disease had only just started spreading globally at this point. As Table 1
shows, it was not until the end of January that politicians began to inform
people about it. The word cloud of weeks 5–8 indicates that the word
“coronavirus” was used8. However, it was still not signiﬁcantly discussed
among politicians at that time. The terms “covid” and “coronavirus”
dominate weeks 9–12 and 13–16. In weeks 13–16 “covid” was used more
often than “coronavirus” in comparison to previous weeks. Other words
that were frequently used are associated with the measures put in place
against coronavirus such as social distancing, quarantine, and the
equivalent words in languages other than English. When March and April
are compared to January and even February, it is possible to see how
much the discourse on Twitter changed. Therefore, state leaders
communicated about the same topic with the same or similar words.
There has probably not been many events where one word or term, in this
case, “covid”, was used across the globe at the same time by state leaders.
Third insight from social media analytics concerns with how often
state leaders tweeted. The fourth insight from social media analytics
relates to the growth of Twitter followers. First, the number of tweets sent
by state leaders was analyzed. Second, the number of followers that state
leaders gained on Twitter was examined. One may assume that these
matters are connected. Therefore, the next section analyzes them in
regression models. However, this section describes and visualizes them.
Figure 3 shows the median value of the weekly growth of state leaders. In
the case of a change of government, a period for politicians before taking
ofﬁce and two months after taking ofﬁce was ﬁltered out to mitigate its
impact on the growth. Furthermore, as already mentioned, a complete
dataset of all weeks for all politicians was not available. However, the
lowest number of cases was 110 (the beginning of the timeline) and the
highest was 134 (the end of the timeline). Figure 3 clearly shows that the
general weekly growth rate was around 0.5% or less. After 9 March 2020,
there was a signiﬁcant increase in the weekly growth rate. In the
following weeks, the growth rate was around 1.5%. In this period, there
was a signiﬁcant increase in the number cases worldwide across continents. At the end of April, the weekly growth rate decreased because

included member states had conﬁrmed cases. From Figure 1, it is clear
that while only some state leaders considered it important to share information about COVID-19 in January, the majority of leaders were
tweeting about COVID-19 in mid-March. Understandably, this was
because COVID-19, by then, had begun to spread in most African, Asian,
European, and Latin American countries that were not affected early. The
primary source of data about conﬁrmed cases was China Data Lab
(2020).
The second insight from social media analytics relates to what words
leaders used. While it is possible to express the content of tweets by
certain groups on Twitter in different ways, one of the most effective
ways is to visualize it as word clouds. It is a commonly used technique in
social media analytics (Grover et al., 2020; Kar, 2020). This has been
done in Figure 2. Figure 2 shows the words most frequently used in 16
weeks in four word clouds. The text of each tweet was processed to ﬁlter
out stop words by using R package stopwords (Benoit et al., 2020). The
source of stop words was either “snowball” or “stopwords-iso” depending

content, others may use it mainly as a tool for spreading news and tweets
from external sources and users.
Moreover, there are two vertical lines. The blue dashed line indicates
the ﬁrst case of COVID-19 in a country, while the dotted orange line
denotes the ﬁrst mention of COVID-19 on Twitter by a particular leader.
These two lines are important to visualize as one may expect that the
growth rate would start after the ﬁrst mention of COVID-19 and the ﬁrst
conﬁrmed case in a country. Each graph starts with the ﬁrst week of
January (30 December 2019) and the last week ends on 3 May 2020.
Therefore, it covers a period of a little over four months. The weeks of
January can be considered as a baseline for growth. It is possible to see
that there is a sharp increase in the growth rate for all presented leaders

most countries' measures against the spread of COVID-19 were already
put in place by then.
The growth rate and frequency of tweeting were not equal, and there
are signiﬁcant differences between state leaders. Figure 4 visualizes
several points and presents 8 graphs of selected state leaders who are
important regional or world leaders and who actively use Twitter.
However, the ﬁgures of 108 state leaders are available in the supplementary material. For each leader, the growth rate in percentage is the
ﬁrst y-axis in the form of a line, and the number of tweets and retweets is
the second y-axis in the form of a histogram. The light blue corresponds
with retweets and the pink with original tweets. There is a difference
between the usage of Twitter. While some users may use it for original

European politicians such as Giuseppe Conte and Boris Johnson even
gained around 15% of followers within one week. Similar growth was
also experienced by Latin American leaders Ivan Duque and Alberto
Fernandez. Emmanuel Macron and Pedro Sanchez had a lower increase

in February and especially March. In April, the growth rate declines as
the room for growth was partially exhausted. It is more likely that citizens would start following their leaders in February and especially March
as the pandemic started to signiﬁcantly spread. As graphs clearly show,

interested in it. In the analysis of why people follow political actors,
Parmelee and Bichard (2012) show that one of the motives for using
Twitter is information-seeking. Other studies concluded that for some
people information-seeking is the primary motive for using Twitter
(Hughes et al., 2012; Johnson and Yang, 2009). During the health
emergency that contributes to increased news consumption, mentioned
motives should affect Twitter followers count for accounts that provide
health and other relevant information during times of crisis. Indeed,
ﬁndings of this study conﬁrm that most state leaders provide information
about the COVID-19 pandemic and their number of Twitter followers
greatly increased during the pandemic.
These ﬁndings correspond to the UGT (Katz et al., 1973) that states
that people want to seek out speciﬁc media to fulﬁll their concrete needs.
The UGT is commonly used with social media (Chen, 2011; Hollenbaugh
and Ferris, 2014; Hunt et al., 2012; Johnson and Yang, 2009; Pittman and
Reich, 2016; Sheldon, 2008; Sheldon and Bryant, 2016; Smock et al.,
2011). This approach explains the growth of followers. Some people did
not have a need to have a Twitter account before the pandemic. Others
might have a Twitter account, but they did not have a need and reason to
follow their state leaders. They could use Twitter for entertainment to
follow their favorite celebrities. As mentioned throughout the paper,
there are various motives for using Twitter than information-seeking.
However, the outbreak of COVID-19 affected the needs of many people
and at that moment, the need for many was to be informed about matters
related to this health crisis. Some may satisfy this need by watching
television or listening to the radio. However, some people also chose
Twitter as a medium that can fulﬁll these needs. Then, this led to signiﬁcant growth of Twitter followers when the pre-pandemic and
pandemic period is compared.
The ﬁnding on the growth of followers offers some contrast to the
literature on spreading misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic
(Gruzd and Mai, 2020; Lovari, 2020; Perez-Dasilva et al., 2020; Pulido
et al., 2020; Rodríguez et al., 2020; Vraga et al., 2020). It is indeed true
that misinformation can be spread via social media. However, state
leaders should provide relevant and legitimate information about the
health situation. This can potentially lead to better knowledge about
the topic and adopting adequate measures to limit the spread of
COVID-19. It seems that a signiﬁcant amount of people might be
interested in this information. Therefore, after all, the use of social
media during the pandemic may not be as harmful if citizens consume
relevant content.

that could have been caused by an already signiﬁcant number of followers. Interestingly, in the case of Cyril Ramaphosa, the growth rate
continued to increase until April. This may be because South Africa,
unlike European countries, experienced a signiﬁcant spread in COVID-19
later. Donald Trump had a higher growth rate at the beginning of the year
in the middle of impeachment than later during the COVID-19 pandemic.
3.2. Insights from regression models
Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 2 and the results of
regression models are presented in Table 3. Model 1 uses all tweets,
including retweets, while Model 2 uses only original tweets. However,
overall, models show the same results. Models show that state leaders
that tweeted more often gained more followers. Citizens want to have
new updates about the status of the pandemic. Therefore, it is possible
that people who did not use Twitter previously created accounts to start
following their state leaders if they believed that they would receive
frequent updates in this way. Another explanation could be that citizens
may have already been Twitter users but not have followed their state
leaders, as they would not see value in that. However, during the COVID19 pandemic when state leaders have been tweeting frequently, citizens
could be persuaded to follow their state leader. Another signiﬁcant variable is the ratio of the number of followers to internet users. This ﬁnding
relates to the previous possible explanation. The possibility for the
growth of Twitter followers is limited when already leaders are followed
by a signiﬁcant amount of people that have access to the internet.
Therefore, in many countries where Twitter was not widely used, the
citizens might see it as a new information source and a way of gaining
quick access to news.
The number of cases per one million people has a negative association
with the dependent variable and does not reach statistical signiﬁcance in
the model. One might consider this surprising. However, even countries
with a small number of cases have introduced strict measures to prevent
the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, the need for information from state
leaders may be similar for citizens from countries with a low and high
number of cases. The last variable was language. Models show that when
country leaders used French their growth rate increased signiﬁcantly in
comparison to the reference group (“other languages”). Many neighboring African countries use French as their main language, and, therefore, there was a possibility to follow various leaders in the region. All
other global languages also have a positive direction, and English and
Spanish also reach statistical signiﬁcance. However, their coefﬁcients are
lower compared to French.

4.2. Implications to practice

4. Discussion

There are some clear implications to practice from this study. During
times of crisis, political actors and relevant authorities should offer
relevant information through different media. Twitter, as a social media
website, is a relatively new medium compared to traditional television or
radio. At the moment, not all state leaders use Twitter. However, this
study shows that state leaders who tweeted more frequently gained more
Twitter followers. Therefore, people will follow state leaders when they
offer information to fulﬁll their needs during health emergencies. Understandably, there are fewer reasons and less motivation to follow
rather inactive accounts. In today's digital age, governments should make
use of modern technology, such as Twitter, to be transparent on the state
of the country and provide relevant health information for their citizens.
Recommendation and information from relevant authorities are important for preventing the spread of COVID-19 as a study on U. S. governors'
Twitter communications conﬁrms (Grossman et al., 2020). However, of
course, information and government transparency are not connected
only with the COVID-19 pandemic. In general, state actors, governments,
and their agencies should offer relevant and swift information via Twitter
on state issues and matter.

4.1. Contributions to theory and literature
This paper contributes to the signiﬁcant body of literature examining
the COVID-19 pandemic. The study showed that the global pandemic
COVID-19 signiﬁcantly impacted the discourse on Twitter accounts of
state leaders. It was the most important topic at that time. Twitter is an
important tool for state leaders as it allows them to easily communicate
directly with their citizens. They recognize this importance. Therefore, it
is not a surprise that most governments have an active presence on social
media (Barber
a and Zeitzoff, 2018). Findings support that state leaders
had an active role on Twitter also during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Increased news consumption by people is associated with COVID-19
pandemic (Casero-Ripolles, 2020). Understandably, people want to
have information about the health situation in their countries. Twitter is
a medium through which news and information can be obtained.
Therefore, under the assumption that state leaders provide information
on their Twitter accounts, information-seeking citizens should be

4.3. Limitations and future research

Declarations

The limitation of the study is that it was not feasible to conﬁrm that
followers are legitimate accounts of citizens. However, the same limitation also applies to the pre-pandemic period. The study focused only on
Twitter follower counts and did not analyze followers. This is understandable as the study would have to analyze the activity of hundreds of
millions of Twitter accounts in different time periods. It is very difﬁcult to
detect whether accounts are legitimate, especially if accounts are passive
and do not tweet.
In relation to this study, there is a possibility for future research. It
will be especially interesting to see whether politicians retain newly
obtained followers or whether users will unfollow them in large numbers
when the crisis is over. It is already possible to see that the growth rate is
decreasing in comparison to March 2020 in the case of the majority of
politicians. However, it does not seem likely that the crisis will be over
soon. Therefore, it is possible that there will not be any mass unfollowing
soon and that more people will use Twitter.

5. Conclusion

The authors declare no conﬂict of interest.

The study showed that the global pandemic COVID-19 signiﬁcantly
impacted the discourse on Twitter. It was the most important topic at that
time. Furthermore, most leaders reacted to the spread of COVID-19. While
some mentioned COVID-19 already in January, others mentioned it ﬁrst in
February, March, or April. However, in total, 64.8% of UN member states
had a leader that tweeted about COVID-19. Another key ﬁnding is that
there was a signiﬁcant growth rate of Twitter followers for state leaders in
comparison with pre-pandemic months. Leaders had a higher growth of
followers when they used their Twitter accounts more frequently.
Therefore, it seems that citizens were interested in the latest update from
their leading politicians. Furthermore, especially French-speaking politicians had a higher growth rate compared to leaders speaking other languages and the growth rate was higher when the ratio of the number of
followers to internet users was lower as there was room for growth.
