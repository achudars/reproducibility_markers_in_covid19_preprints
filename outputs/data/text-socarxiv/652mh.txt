Abstract
One year after passage of the European work-life balance directive, and thus recognition of the
need for policy support, measures to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic are shaping
parents’ work-life balance in significant ways. Academically, we are challenged to explore
whether existing theoretical frameworks hold in this new environment with combined old and
new policy frameworks. We are also challenged to understand the nuanced ways in which the
first lockdown affects the combination of paid work and care. We address both of these issues,
providing a cross-sectional comparative analysis of highly educated mothers’ perceptions of
work-life balance during the COVID-19 pandemic in Finland and the Netherlands. Our findings
show that highly educated Finnish mothers have more difficulty combining work and care
during the first lockdown than Dutch mothers. The absence of state-provided care during the
lockdown creates greater difficulty for full-time working Finnish mothers in a dual-earner/statecarer system than an absence of such care in the Dutch one-and-a-half earner system, where
most mothers work part-time. Further analyses suggest variation in part-time and (nearly) fulltime hours mitigates the work-life balance experiences of highly educated Dutch mothers. We
discuss these findings in light of current theoretical frameworks and highlight avenues for future
research.

Introduction
Work-life balance is a key issue in European social policymaking. The 2019 European worklife balance directive (European Parliament, 2019) marks recognition of sustained gender
inequality in work and family spheres and the need for adequate work-family policy. Following
passage of the law, however, the circumstances for combining work and care changed
drastically with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Measures taken to curb the effects of the
pandemic, such as the closing of schools and childcare centres, shifted the boundaries between
paid work and private life. Especially for parents working from home, these boundaries have
nearly dissolved, leaving them – at least in popular media – unable to balance work with other
life spheres (Perelman, 2020).
Pandemic lockdown measures are undoubtedly impacting parents across Europe
(Eurofound, 2020), but their impact on parents’ work-life balance and gender inequality is not
yet clear. The emerging evidence – to the best of our knowledge, based on single country case
studies – is contradictory, suggesting that the impact of the first lockdown on work-life balance
can be negative or positive. Some studies suggest mothers have been impacted more than
fathers by the first lockdown, with mothers experiencing greater work pressure, greater
adjustments of working hours and times, and an overall worsening of work-life balance
(Adams-Prassl et al., 2020; Carlson et al., 2020; Cooper and Mosseri, 2020; Yerkes et al., 2020).
Other studies show fathers have taken on greater amounts of childcare and housework in
countries like the US and the Netherlands (Carlson et al., 2020; Yerkes et al., 2020). The crosscountry variation in the gendered impact is potentially related to the varied work-family policies
of countries before and during the pandemic (Koslowski et al., 2020). Comparative studies that
account for these work-family policy settings are needed to clarify such ambiguous findings to
date. We provide such a cross-country comparison of highly educated mothers’ experiences of
work-life balance in two defamilialised welfare states, Finland and the Netherlands. We focus

2

on highly educated mothers as they are most likely to face the double burden of combining paid
work and childcare. The first lockdown potentially adds to this burden, but not necessarily in
similar ways across countries, underscoring the need to account for the policy context before
and during the lockdown.
Studying mothers’ work-life balance experiences during the first lockdown in
comparative perspective is challenging. Existing theoretical frameworks, like the
defamilialisation framework, need to be re-examined to see whether they offer sufficient scope
for understanding the impact of the pandemic. Defamilialised welfare states, including Finland
and the Netherlands, are presumed pre-pandemic to offer high levels of support to families in
their caregiving duties (Leitner, 2003; Lister, 1997) and thus to offer better policy support for
work-life balance. However, the closing of childcare centres and schools means many
institutional mechanisms of defamilialisation eroded, or vanished overnight. It may be argued
that the closing of schools and childcare centres is a form of refamilialisation, i.e., returning
childcare responsibilities to parents. Alternative childcare options, such as grandparents or
babysitters, were generally unavailable given social distancing measures. The occurrence of
refamilialisation due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown suggests closer theoretical and
empirical scrutiny is needed.
This article re-examines our theoretical and empirical understanding of the relationship
between work-family policy support and mothers’ experiences of work-life balance against the
backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate the following question: How and to what
extent do existing theoretical frameworks explain variation in highly educated mothers’
experiences of work-life balance in Finland and the Netherlands during the first COVID-19
lockdown? We answer this question by combining cross-sectional survey data from Finland and
the Netherlands on highly educated mothers’ perceptions of work-life balance during the first
COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. Cross-country comparison allows us to move beyond single-

3

country studies on the impact of the pandemic to consider mothers’ perceptions of work-life
balance accounting for policy contexts (Ciccia and Javornik, 2019). We therefore account for
the work-family policy context in place prior to the first lockdown as well as parental supports
provided during the first lockdown (Blum and Dobrotić, 2020; Koslowski et al., 2020).

Policy context: life during COVID-19
The first lockdown in Finland and the Netherlands began concurrently, with a similar focus.
Parental support during this lockdown was also reasonably similar (see Table 1). Finland's
initial goal was to protect at-risk groups and implement restrictive measures to prevent hospitals
from becoming overburdened. This approach led to stringent physical isolation measures,
including the closure of most schools as of 16 March. An exception was made for the youngest
pupils (classes 1-3), but in practice, attendance was very low, and most children moved to online
teaching. Warm school meals, traditional in the Finnish education system, remained available
in many municipalities. Childcare remained open for children who needed it, but usage during
the first lockdown appears to have been low (Espoo, 2020). Remote working was strongly
recommended. Parents who remained at home to care for children without compensation from
their employer could apply for a new temporary benefit (€723.50/month). Primary and lower
secondary schools returned to in-class teaching on 14 May. Other educational institutions were
given the option to open partially from 14 April, but the general recommendation towards online
teaching is still in effect at the time of writing.

[Table 1 about here]

The Dutch approach to the COVID-19 pandemic during the first wave was framed as an
‘intelligent’ lockdown by the Dutch government. The government emphasized individual rather

4

than state responsibility, while attempting to mitigate the social and economic consequences of
the pandemic. Schools and childcare centres were closed, effective from 16 March. In the
Netherlands, schools only remained open to children of parents working in essential
occupations or sectors. One-fourth of parents entitled to this care used it (Verhue and Bouwman,
2020). In addition, parents using formal care were entitled to full compensation of their copayment for the period in which childcare centres were closed. Primary schools partially
reopened in May, with a full reopening 11 June. Secondary schools closed from 15 March until
a partial reopening 2 June. Secondary schools did not fully reopen until after the summer
holidays (16 August).

Theorizing work and care during COVID-19
The policy context during COVID-19 suggests parental support during the first lockdown was
similar in Finland and the Netherlands. Yet prior to the pandemic, Finland and the Netherlands
were seen to offer similar or quite different work-family settings, depending upon the
theoretical approach taken.

Defamilialisation
Theoretical frameworks explaining variation in state-family-market relationships draw heavily
on the concept of defamilialisation. As a concept, defamilialisation specifies the family-friendly
institutional settings that support families in their caregiving duties and help family members
to be independent of their families for care needs (Leitner, 2003; León, 2009; Lister, 1997;
Lohmann and Zagel, 2016). Leitner (2003), for example, views defamilialising policies as
unburdening the family in its caring function, for instance by offering public or subsidized
private childcare and generously paid leave provisions (Lohmann and Zagel, 2016).

5

Finland and the Netherlands are generally characterised as defamilialised welfare states.
In Finland, defamilialised policies unburden the family from its caring function, and explicitly
prioritise gender equality at work and at home (Lohmann and Zagel, 2016). The position of the
Netherlands is more ambivalent, however. Cho (2014) categorizes Finland and the Netherlands
as examples of a moderate form of defamilialisation. This form is characterised by a moderate
support of women’s economic independence and moderately frees them of care responsibilities.
At the same time, this form of defamilialisation provides cash payments that support family
care at home (although Saraceno, 2010 criticizes cash payments for maintaining cultural
expectations of female carers). Moderately defamilialised countries are further characterised by
moderate gender employment gaps and wage gaps, given levels of part-time work and low-paid
jobs. Furthermore, they combine a moderate amount of father-specific leave and spending on
childcare, or a low level of father-specific leave and high spending on childcare.
There are some limitations to this defamilialisation categorisation. Despite their
classification as defamilialised, mothers in both countries are expected to ‘do it all’. In Finland,
this means a double bind of working full-time and caring for children and the home (e.g.
Wierda-Boer et al., 2009); in the Netherlands, mothers ‘do it all’ while working part-time (Knijn
and Da Roit, 2014; Knijn and Kremer, 1997; Yerkes and Hewitt, 2019). Moreover, Lohman
and Zagel (2016), like Cho (2014), view the Dutch welfare state as defamilialised, but as Van
Hooren and Becker (2012) argue, the Dutch welfare state historically maintained contrasting
care regimes, with a high degree of defamilialisation for institutionalised elderly care (cf.
Saraceno, 2010) and weak defamilialisation for publicly subsidised but highly privatised
childcare. The clustering of defamilialised welfare is thus highly dependent on the policy area
studied (see also Bambra, 2007). Applications of defamilialisation can similarly mask crosscountry variation (Yerkes and Javornik, 2019).

6

We argue that regarding care for children, defamilialisation is stronger in Finland than
in the Netherlands. At the same time, Finland and the Netherlands exhibit varying forms of
familialization, i.e. the extent to which welfare states support dependency between family
members, for example through (un)paid parental and care leave (Leitner, 2003; Zagel and
Lohmann, 2020). Zagel and Lohmann (2020) correctly argue for a combined application of
these concepts to allow for nuanced analyses.
Drawing on this literature, the closure of schools and childcare centres is a form of
refamilialisation, whereby the welfare state – albeit temporarily – returned care responsibilities
to the family. At the same time, other defamilialised policies (e.g., emphasising gender equality
at work) and familialised policies (e.g., emphasising gendered care norms) remained in place.
Theoretically, we expect the refamilialisation of childcare to affect countries differently. In
defamilialised welfare state contexts emphasising the public provision of care services (i.e., the
state as provider), in combination with little emphasis on familialised policies (e.g., Finland),
we expect a small(er) impact of refamilialisation. In contrast, in defamilialised welfare state
contexts emphasising publicly subsidized welfare state contexts (i.e., the market as provider),
in combination with an emphasis on familialised policies (e.g., the Netherlands),
refamilialisation is likely to place a greater care burden on women. We thus hypothesize that
perceived work-life balance will be worse for highly educated Dutch mothers than for highly
educated Finnish mothers (H1).

Cultural ideals of care
The defamilialisation approach, while widely applied, does not account for crucial cultural
differences in care (e.g. Kremer, 2007; Pfau-Effinger, 2005). Care ideals are culturally shaped,
moral images of what ‘good’ caregiving looks like and form the basis for dominant ideas of
what constitutes a good mother. From this perspective, variation in women’s employment is

7

less a reflection of defamilialising and/or familialising policies and more a reflection of
normative ideas of care and citizenship in relation to mothers’ employment decisions (Kremer,
2007). Cultural care ideal arguments go beyond the state-family and/or state-family-market
relationship to consider, for example, ideas about what care is, people's motivations to care, as
well as images of caregivers and receivers (Kremer, 2007). In her salient work on cultural care
ideals, Kremer (2007) compellingly argued for a debate extending beyond the contrasting fairy
tale notions of Cinderella versus Snow White. Nordic welfare states, including Finland, are
portrayed as a Cinderella fairy tale, whereby care is a burden, and mothers need to be ‘freed’
from their caregiving burden. State-provided childcare is ‘good’ and signals a societal valuing
of care. The Netherlands and other Christian democratic welfare states, in contrast, are
portrayed as the fairy tale of Snow White, who is happy to care for the seven dwarfs. Here, care
is seen as crucial for social cohesion and is socialized as a positive moral attitude (to care for
others is good). Too much state intervention in the family’s caregiving function would disrupt
families and societies.
A focus on the cultural ideas of care and citizenship places greater emphasis on
interdependencies (e.g., between mothers and fathers) than on mothers’ economic and care
independence per se, which forms the foundation of Cho’s (2004) defamilialisation typology.
From this perspective, the smaller wage gap between men and women in Finland is a sign of
interdependency, while the continuing gender wage gaps and significant differences in the work
hours of mothers and fathers in the Netherlands results in mothers’ continued dependence on a
male breadwinner. A focus on the cultural ideas of care and citizenship also emphasises the
importance of participation in multiple spheres – the state (e.g., political participation), markets
(e.g., the labour market), and families, meaning care should be valued in society and people
should have real opportunities to care (Hobson, 2014). Here we see the complexity of mothers’
positions in the two welfare states. Dutch women’s political participation lags behind that of

8

Finnish women, and while both countries have high female employment rates, Dutch mothers
work primarily part-time and Finnish mothers mainly full-time (Eurostat, 2020; see Table 2
below). The Dutch pattern of female part-time employment does, however, create potentially
greater opportunities to care than in the Finnish context.
Hence, Finland and the Netherlands differ in their care ideals, but these care ideals are
likely to differ across educational levels. Highly educated mothers almost always work fulltime in Finland (Eurostat, 2020). In the Netherlands, part-time work is common across all
education levels, with 64% of highly educated women working part-time (self-reported data;
Eurostat, 2020). More detailed studies suggest highly educated mothers tend to work longer
hours than mothers with less education, however (Portegijs and Brakel, 2016; Portegijs and
Keuzenkamp, 2008). Thus the double burden of highly educated mothers in both countries
might be quite similar. In Finland and the Netherlands, mothers consistently spend more hours
doing housework and childcare than fathers (OECD, 2020). Moreover, mothers are more likely
to simultaneously do housework or care tasks during leisure time, leading to a ‘contamination’
and fragmentation of leisure (Mattingly and Bianchi, 2003). Working mothers have less leisure
time and are less satisfied with leisure, leading to perceived time pressure (Gimenez-Nadal and
Sevilla-Sanz, 2011), which can negatively affect perceived work-life balance.
In this line of reasoning, we expect marginal differences in the perceived work-life
balance between highly educated Dutch and Finnish mothers during the first lockdown (H2).
Despite their classification as defamilialised welfare states and varied cultural ideas of care,
mothers in both countries are expected to take on greater caregiving tasks than fathers.
Especially in Finland, where highly educated mothers work full-time, refamilialisation will lead
to a worsening of work-life balance. In the Netherlands, refamilialisation will also have a
negative effect, but this will be partially mitigated by the lower working hours of highly
educated mothers.

Work-care regimes
Alongside cultural ideals of care and state-market-family explanations of women’s greater role
in caregiving, existing theoretical frameworks also explicitly account for the variation in
employment policies and employment expectations across welfare states. Gender cultures (i.e.,
the values and beliefs relating to the gendered relationship of the family to both employment
and childcare, Pfau-Effinger, 2005; Pfau‐Effinger, 2012), form the theoretical foundation for
salient frameworks theorising care ideals in relation to employment, i.e., work-care regimes
(Crompton, 1999; Rubery et al., 1999).
Crompton’s (1999) conceptualization of gender relations within welfare states as a
continuum of employment and care ideals offers a useful starting point. Welfare states differ in
their emphasis on traditional male breadwinner/female carer roles, modifications of these roles,
or a focus on dual-earner/dual-carer roles, whereby parents have rights and obligations to work
and care for children. Welfare states also differ in how parents are supported in these dual roles
(Pfau-Effinger, 2005). This is evident in the variation of work-family policy, particularly in
relation to leave policies (maternity, paternity, parental leave), childcare services, child benefits
(including tax benefits), and flexible working policies enabling a reconciliation of work and
caregiving responsibilities (Plantenga and Remery, 2013; Thévenon, 2011; Zagel and
Lohmann, 2020).
Women’s decisions about work and caregiving, and how to combine these
responsibilities, are shaped within these cultural and institutional settings. Despite being
similarly classified as defamilialised welfare regimes, Finland and the Netherlands exhibit
different work-care regimes with differing perspectives on the rights and obligations of mothers
and fathers. Finland is a dual-earner/state-carer model (Pfau-Effinger, 2005) and the
Netherlands is a one-and-a-half-earner model, whereby fathers work full-time and mothers

10

work part-time (Plantenga, 2002). Table 2 summarises key characteristics of these work-care
regimes, focusing on employment outcomes, childcare enrolment and costs, leave
arrangements, and child home care allowances.

[Table 2 about here]

Comparatively, the Finnish welfare state is more family friendly (van Gerven & Nygård,
2017) than the Dutch welfare state. Both women and men work before and after becoming a
parent and publicly provided family policies enable parents to work full-time. Parents receive
extensive support around childbirth in Finland, allowing for almost a full year of paid leave,
and leave can be extended to up to three years using a ‘home care allowance’. In contrast, in
the Dutch one-and-a-half earner model, mothers reduce working hours after birth and fathers
often increase working hours. Family leave arrangements are limited, and parental leave
remains largely unpaid. Until passage of the European work-life balance directive, little
political pressure for generous and/or extended leave arrangements existed given the highly
flexible Dutch working time regime (Plantenga and Remery, 2009a; van Gerven and Nygård,
2017). Consequently, paid leave arrangements are only recently being extended, with moderate
extensions becoming effective in 2022 (den Dulk and Yerkes, 2020).
Childcare in Finland is high quality, heavily subsidized, and a child’s right. While
childcare services are readily available in Finland, many families make use of the home care
allowance (Mahon et al., 2012). This results in relatively low enrolment rates for children under
the age of 3, lower than in other Nordic countries (Thévenon, 2011). In the Netherlands,
childcare is market-based, relatively expensive, particularly for higher income groups, and
historically problematic in relation to availability, accessibility and quality (Plantenga and
Remery, 2009b; Yerkes and Javornik, 2019). Children generally attend childcare part-time,

11

with parents relying on alternative care forms (e.g., grandparents), at least one to two days a
week. 2018 legislation on innovation and quality in childcare appears to be causing an
improvement in Dutch childcare (den Dulk and Yerkes, 2020), which in the long term might
challenge deeply embedded cultural ideals of maternal care (Kremer, 2007) intertwined with
the part-time work culture.
Although offering comparatively extensive work-care policy supports, the Finnish
work-care regime is less flexible than the Dutch one. Flexible work arrangements are limited
to part-time working parents (up to 30 hours a week) with small children (under the age of 3)
and for parents with children starting primary school (aged 7-8). Consequently, Finnish mothers
work full-time, or not at all. In sum, despite their common classification as defamilialised
countries, Finland and the Netherlands exhibit different work-care regimes.
In the Finnish dual-earner/state-carer regime, the combined emphasis of full-time
employment and caregiving norms likely places greater pressure on highly educated mothers
than in the Dutch one-and-a-half-earner model where part-time employment may provide
mothers more space to combine work and care. The shock of shifting to working, caring, and
schooling from home during the lockdown is therefore expected to be larger in Finland than in
the Netherlands. In this line of reasoning, we suggest work-life balance during the first
lockdown will be worse among highly educated mothers in Finland than in the Netherlands
(H3).

Data and Methods
Our study relies on pooled cross-sectional datasets collected separately in Finland and the
Netherlands.

Finnish data

12

The Finnish data were collected through an online survey concerning Finnish families’
experiences during the COVID-19 lockdown. The survey included questions on work–family
reconciliation, marital and parental conflicts, as well as questions concerning everyday life
during the first lockdown. Data collection took place four weeks following the start of lockdown
measures (23 April-17 May). Data were gathered using a nonprobability sampling technique
(convenience sampling; e.g., Etikan, 2016). Hence, the data are not representative of the
population and subjective methods were used to gather the sample. To minimize problems
related to convenience sampling, invitations to participate were disseminated widely through
different channels. The survey was primarily advertised through the [anonymous name]
university communication service, including a press release shared with more than 400 media
representatives in Finland. The survey was also distributed through the university and teams’
own social media accounts. The final sample included 653 respondents, all parents with at least
one child under 18 at home. For the purposes of this article, the sample was restricted to highly
educated working mothers (applied university or university degree), resulting in a final analytic
sample of 256 highly educated working mothers.

Dutch data
The Dutch data were collected using an online survey module administered to members of the
Dutch Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel. The LISS panel is a
representative, random probability-based sample based on Dutch national statistics office
registry data (Statistics Netherlands). Data collection took place one month following the start
of lockdown measures (13-28 April). All respondents lived in households with at least one child
under 18 at home, with at least one working parent. 1,234 panel members were selected, and a
response rate of 71% resulted in a sample of 868 parents. Restricting this sample to highly
educated working mothers (applied university or university degree), resulted in a final analytic

13

sample of 222 highly educated working mothers. After pooling the datasets, we had a combined
analytic sample of 478 respondents.

Variables
Our dependent variable, work-life balance, was measured in the Finnish survey as
“Drawing the line between work and caring for children is easy during the corona lockdown”.
Respondents answered on a 5-point scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. The
work-life balance measure in the Dutch data was based on the European Working Conditions
Survey (EWCS), modified to the first lockdown. “How easy or difficult is it for you to combine
your paid work with your caregiving responsibilities since the general closure of schools and
childcare centres (including home schooling/homework support)?”. Respondents answered on
a 5-point scale ranging from very easy to very difficult. For analytic purposes, the scale was
reversed, so that low values indicated (very) difficult and high values indicated (very) easy to
balance work and caregiving responsibilities during the first lockdown.
The Dutch and Finnish data were collected independently, with cross-national
comparison not being a primary purpose during data collection. Hence, the Dutch and Finnish
dependent variables are not identical in their wording which should be taken into account when
interpreting the results. We used the Dutch answer categories of (very) easy – (very) difficult
(see Table 3).

[Table 3 about here]

We accounted for several covariates which are well-known to influence work-life
balance, including age (centred around the grand mean), relationship status (whether the
respondent has a partner or not), work situation of the respondent (working from home, partly

14

working from home or working at the normal work location), work situation of the partner
(working from home, partly working from home, working at the normal work location, no
working partner), number of children in the household (top-coded at 3) and the organization of
childcare during the lockdown (children are (partly) at school or childcare versus children are
fully at home). We also included age of the youngest child, differentiating between 0-2, 3-6, 712, and 13-17 years old. We also included an “age youngest child missing” category to account
for a high number of missing cases on this variable in the Dutch data, which only included data
on the ages of school children. The overview of descriptive statistics is also included in Table
3. We note two differences: more Dutch mothers worked at the workplace during the lockdown,
and Finnish mothers have slightly younger children than Dutch mothers, likely in relation to
the absence of Dutch data on the ages of children not attending school.

Method
We used multivariate linear regression to analyse the factors related to highly educated
mothers perceived work-life balance in Finland and the Netherlands. We report effects of the
covariates on work-life balance for both countries, where a positive effect means mothers find
it is easier to combine work and care. Because of the small sample sizes, we include significant
effects at the α=0.10 as well as α=0.05, α=0.01 and α=0.01 levels.

Results
Table 3 shows the perceived work-life balance of highly educated working mothers in
Finland and the Netherlands during the first COVID-19 lockdown. The results reveal a highly
significant difference between Finland and the Netherlands. It seems Finnish mothers find it
much more difficult to balance work and care during the first lockdown than Dutch mothers.
While just over 40 per cent of Dutch mothers perceive the balancing of work and care to be

15

difficult or very difficult, the share of Finnish mothers is as high as 68 per cent. Another crosscountry difference is found in the share of mothers that consider achieving work-life balance
during the lockdown to be neither difficult nor easy. In Finland, the share of mothers is only
around five per cent whereas in the Netherlands about every fourth mother looks at the
balancing of work and care in this neutral manner. Interestingly, we find only a small difference
between Finnish and Dutch mothers who say balancing work and care is very easy or easy
during the first lockdown.
The linear regression models are presented in Table 4. Model 1 is the model for the
pooled dataset, whereas models 2 and 3 show the split model per country. Overall, the
multivariate results confirm the descriptive results. Highly educated Dutch mothers find it
easier to combine work and care during the first lockdown than Finnish mothers (b=0.276). In
the COVID-19 lockdown context, the dual-earner/state-carer model emphasising full-time
work in Finland seems to place greater pressure on highly educated mothers than the Dutch
one-and-a-half-earner model, where part-time work may enable mothers to combine work and
care more easily.

[Table 4 about here]

While we lack data on working hours in the Finnish dataset (where 86% of highly
educated mothers works full-time, see Table 2; Eurostat, 2020), we tested the importance of
working time by controlling for this potential confounding factor in an additional model for the
Netherlands (see Supplemental material/Table S1). In a parsimonious model grouping mothers
working long hours part-time with full-time workers (i.e., 31+ hours/week) compared to
mothers working less than 30 hours/week, we find that mothers who work longer hours have

16

more difficulty combining work and care during the lockdown than mothers who work fewer
hours.
Furthermore, having a partner is very important. Partnered mothers find it easier to
combine work and care than mothers without a partner (b=0.619). Potentially, being able to
share the extra responsibility of childcare and home-schooling that was normally outsourced to
childcare centres and schools, makes work-care reconciliation easier. When we look at the work
situation of the respondent and her partner, we find a borderline significant effect of working
at the workplace. Mothers who are able to work at the workplace find it easier to combine work
and care than mothers who work at home (b=0.317). Furthermore, we find that if the partner is
unemployed, combining work and care is also easier for highly educated mothers (b=0.435).
The most important factor in highly educated mothers’ perceived work-life balance
during the first lockdown is the presence or absence of young children. Having young children
between the ages of 0 and 6 is most negative for mothers’ work-life balance during the first
lockdown, as children of this age-group need the most nurturing and care. Work-life balance is
slightly better for mothers with children aged 7 to 12 (significantly better compared to the 3-6year category), whereas work-life balance is much better for mothers with secondary schoolaged children between 13 and 17 years old (b=0.945). This result suggests that mothers with
young children (aged 3-6, even more than between 0-2 years) struggled the most with their
work-life balance during the first lockdown.
Finally, we tested for interaction effects between the two countries and each independent
variable. In most cases, interaction effects were not statistically significant (see Supplemental
material Table S2), apart from having a partner or not. Interestingly, not having a partner clearly
has a less negative effect on mothers’ work-life balance in the Netherlands (b=2.254) than in
Finland (b=1.254) while the difference for partnered mothers is significantly smaller (see
Supplemental material, Figure S1). This result might also be related to the different work-care

17

regimes in these countries, with single, full-time working mothers (in Finland) being harder hit
by lockdown measures than single, part-time working mothers (in the Netherlands).

Conclusion
Increased attention for work-life balance policy support at the European level had little chance
to gain traction at the national level before measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 created
significant barriers for parents in combining work and care. The refamilialisation of care to the
family through the closure of schools and childcare centres during the first lockdown was
unprecedented. We are just now beginning to understand the impact of such a refamilialisation
process on parents’ work-life balance and to investigate the theoretical implications. We
contribute to this literature by examining highly educated mothers’ work-life balance
experiences in Finland and the Netherlands during the first COVID-19 lockdown. Alongside
providing comparative evidence on the acute situation created by the lockdown, we contribute
to the literature by investigating the efficacy of existing theoretical frameworks for
understanding the current crisis.
Our results demonstrate that Finnish mothers experience more difficulty combining
work and care during the first lockdown than Dutch mothers, supporting the work-care regime
framework (Crompton, 1999; Pfau-Effinger, 2005; Plantenga, 2002). Against the refamilialised
backdrop of COVID-19, the dual-earner/state-carer model supported in Finland leaves less
room for highly educated mothers to combine extra care responsibilities with work than the
one-and-a-half-earner model supported in the Netherlands, affirming H3. Our results are not in
line with the defamilialisation framework. Despite the common classification of Finland and
the Netherlands as moderately defamilialised countries (Cho, 2014), the work-life balance
experiences of highly educated Finnish and Dutch mothers differs, leading us to reject H1. The
conclusions in relation to our second hypothesis are less clear. On the one hand, we find more

18

than moderate differences between Finnish and Dutch mothers, suggesting cultural ideals of
care do not offer a sufficient explanation for understanding work-life balance experiences
during the lockdown. On the other hand, the additional analyses with the Dutch data including
working hours suggest that indeed, the negative effect of refamilialisation is mitigated by
working part-time in the Netherlands. But this explanation alone is insufficient to understand
the experiences of Finnish mothers. In the dual-earner/state-carer model, and in contrast to the
Dutch model, Finnish mothers are used to the existence of well-functioning, full-time childcare.
Consequently, Finnish mothers may be more critical of their work-life balance during a
lockdown, in which this well-functioning childcare is absent, especially when the vast majority
of these mothers works full-time. This interwoven effect of working time and the family policy
framework reflected in the work-care regime is further amplified by the presence or absence of
a partner. Not having a partner had a larger negative effect on mothers’ work-life balance in
Finland than in the Netherlands, a finding in line with other results on single parents during the
lockdown (Hertz et al., 2020).
We note some limitations of our study. First, this study combines two cross-sectional
designs, which creates some differences in both the wording and the answer categories of the
dependent variable. Whereas the Finnish dependent variable asked respondents to state whether
they agree or disagree that drawing the line between work and care has been easy, the Dutch
dependent variable asked respondents to state how difficult or easy it has been to combine paid
work and care. Respondents might have found it easier to disagree with the Finnish statement
that combining work and care is easy, rather than reporting difficulty in combining work and
care as in the Dutch case. Nevertheless, both variables measure respondents’ perceived work-life
balance as a measure of relative ease or difficult during the first lockdown, which allows for a
comparison of experiences across countries. Second, while we were able to conduct additional

analyses with the Dutch data controlling for differences in work hours, these data are not

19

available in the Finnish sample. Given the prevalence of full-time work in Finland, however,
variation in working hours would likely be low and can thus be expected to have limited impact
on the results.
This study also opened up interesting avenues for future research. In order to better
understand the ability of pre-COVID-19 theoretical frameworks to explain mothers’
experiences of work-life balance during COVID-19, a broader comparative perspective with
more countries representing greater diversity in relation to defamilialisation, cultural ideals of
care, gender, educational levels, and work-care regimes should be employed. Such comparative
work is needed to unpack overlapping, and at times contradictory employment and family
policies, embedded in diverse cultures of care (Mahon et al., 2012; Pfau-Effinger, 2005). In
particular, further comparative work can help to investigate variation in potentially path
dependent and/or divergent work-family responses implemented during the COVID-19
pandemic (e.g., Koslowski et al., 2020), and the impact on parents. Moreover, as Europe looks
forward to a time when the COVID-19 pandemic is under control, scholarly attention is needed
for the potential long-lasting effects on work-life balance and the policies needed to mitigate
these effects.

parents

A temporary benefit scheme for parents
who stayed at home to care (without
employer compensation). School meals
made available for pick up (availability
and frequency of pick up differed by
municipality).

Existing leave measures remained
available. See Table 1 above. Figures
suggest rather limited take up of leave
and/or holidays during the first month of
Covid-19 (FNV 2020)
No income replacement measures
targeted at parents and/or other carers.
Parents using formal childcare were
entitled to a temporary compensation of
their co-payment while childcare
centres were closed.
