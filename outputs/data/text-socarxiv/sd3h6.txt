Abstract
Urban, peri-urban forests and other natural areas provide a wide range of material and non-material benefits
to people known as ecosystem services. Access to these areas has been linked to improvements in physical
and mental health of local populations. In the Spring of 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic forced many
governments to impose a set of restrictions including the closure of businesses and cancelation of events,
social distancing and limitation of gatherings, and movement limitations. During this period of restrictions,
we conducted a study assessing the importance of urban and peri-urban forests and other natural areas to
people living in and around the city of Burlington, Vermont, USA. We evaluated the use and value changes
related to these natural areas before and during the period of restrictions. We received over 400 surveys
from the local community. The results show that 69.0% of the respondents had increased or greatly
increased their visitation rate to these areas, and 80.6% of respondents considered that the importance of
these natural areas and access to them either increased or greatly increased. Moreover 25.8% of the sample
had either never, or very rarely accessed their local natural areas before the pandemic, but 69.2% of the first
time or infrequent visitors reported that having access to these areas during COVID-19 as ‘very important’.
People reported that these areas were important for a wide range of activities from exercise to birding, but
also reported values related to reducing stress in a time of global chaos. Our results indicate the increasing
demand and value of such areas in times of crisis such as COVID-19. Experts in zoonotic disease predict
the potential for more frequent pandemic events, thus predicating the importance for continued funding for,
maintenance of and improved access to natural areas to our largely urban civilization.

Highlights:
-

Urban and peri-urban natural areas provide a wide range of material and non-material benefits

-

During the COVID-19 pandemic the frequency of use and visits to such areas greatly increased

-

In our survey 26% of natural area visitors were either first time or rare visitors prior to COVID-19
restrictions showing that COVID broadened the user base for natural areas, and shifted the
importance to those visitors

-

80.6% of respondents reported that the importance of these natural areas increased or greatly
increased in value to them during COVID-19 restrictions

-

Our results suggest that in a time of global economic slowdown, increasing or maintaining budgets
for natural areas might be a critical approach to maintaining mental and physical health in times of
crises.

1. Introduction
Urban and peri-urban natural areas provide a wide range of benefits to people (Gómez-Baggethun et al.,
2013). These benefits are known as ecosystem services, and they can be divided at large between material
and non-material benefits (MA, 2005). Some of the non-material benefits, such as enjoyment of aesthetic
beauty, sense of place, or recreation, can be enjoyed actively and/or passively from being able to access
urban parks and forests or other natural areas near towns (Larson et al., 2016b). The importance of enjoying
these benefits is such that it has been linked to physical and mental health improvements, in particular for
communities living in large urban concentrations (Bateman et al., 2013; Keeler et al., 2019; Pretty et al.,
2005).

The SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19, is a viral infectious disease that affects mainly the human
respiratory system (Chen et al., 2020) and was first identified in early December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei
province, China, and since then, it has spread rapidly becoming a global pandemic (Lu et al., 2020). As of

2

June 2020, the pandemic has caused over 400,000 deaths globally (Worldometer, 2020), and it is expected
that, despite the rate of infections slowing down, deaths will continue to occur throughout this year (CDC,
2020). Although it is not possible to provide an accurate estimation of global economic losses due to the
pandemic, the IMF has estimated that the global economy will contract at least 3% in 2020 - a figure larger
than the 2008-2009 global recession. Governments across the globe have issued mobility restrictions aiming
to stop the spread of the disease, resulting in approximately half of the world’s population to stay at home
and avoid public spaces (Honey-Roses et al., 2020). Besides the economic impact of this situation, there
are increasing concerns regarding the less obvious effects on mental health. These effects are derived from
isolation, disconnection, unemployment, stress, etc., and may result in long term impacts beyond the time
frame of the current pandemic (see for example Marrone and Golowka, 1999).

While the medical community is dealing with the immediate health impacts of COVID-19, and economic
stimulus packages offered by most G20 member countries can help to partly alleviate the economic impacts,
we are interested in how people are using natural spaces to cope with the physical and mental health
challenges, and feelings of isolation, predicated by ‘stay at home’ orders and social isolation. A growing
literature has produced an evidence base suggesting that nature exposure helps to deliver mental health
benefits (Bratman et al., 2019), reducing stress levels (Bratman et al., 2012), mitigating rumination (i.e.
the dwelling on negative aspects of a recent situation) (Golding et al., 2018), and increased overall sense of
wellbeing (de Bell et al., 2020).

There is a smaller literature on the importance of access to nature in times of economic and social crises.
For example, during the 2008 recession, American media saw a large uptick in the amount of coverage for
urban foraging (Sachdeva et al., 2018). As millions of Americans lost their jobs and were pushed into food
insecurity, some relied on their urban greenspaces to provide sustenance and a mental escape from the
stressful times (Sachdeva et al., 2018). Following the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in
Futaba County, Japan, city officials have made it a point to rebuild key green spaces that provide cultural
ecosystems services crucial to the recovery of locals (Mabon, 2019). These green spaces are crucial to
providing a sense of pride and identity for residents as they recover from this disaster (Mabon, 2019). A
systematic literature review also uncovered how interactions with ecosystems and the cultural services they
provide are greatly beneficial for refugee populations as they recover from the huge physical and emotional
upheaval during resettlement (Gladkikh et al., 2019).

In the state of Vermont, USA, COVID-19 was first identified on the 7th of March, 2020 (Lamdin, 2020).
The subsequent spread of the disease throughout the state triggered the government to declare a State of

3

Emergency, and to issue a set of restrictive measures aimed to slow down and help to contain the spread of
the disease (Vermont Emergency Management, 2020). These measures included the closing of nonessential businesses, schools and universities, the prohibition of mass gatherings, and the official order to
all Vermont residents to stay at home leaving only for critical reasons related to health and safety (Office
of Governor Phil Scott, 2020).

During this time, we noticed an increase of visitors to urban parks and forests in Burlington, Vermont. The
perceived increase in use of urban parks and forest areas was likely driven by the shutdown of all other
social and market options. However, we wanted to evaluate this perceived increase in use, and better
understand the values expressed by the users of these areas in this time of pandemic. As such, we launched
a survey focused on 25 urban and peri-urban natural areas in and around the city of Burlington, Vermont.
Our aim was to better understand how urban and peri-urban natural areas help to provide the non-material
basic needs of urban communities, and we explore how the benefits and values these areas provide to people
change during times of crisis like we now find ourselves in. The popular press has touted the importance of
outdoor space and nature in these globally stressful times (e.g. Servedio, 2020; Smith, 2020). Here we
provide some empirical evidence to demonstrate just how valuable urban and peri-urban natural areas are
for local welfare in such times.

2. Methods

2.1. Survey Design and Implementation
We designed and implemented an online survey to collect up-to-date information from users of 25 urban
and peri-urban natural areas located in and near Burlington, Vermont (see section 2.2). The survey was
conducted between March 28th and June 8th, and was released within three weeks of the initial spread of
the COVID-19 pandemic and the concordant stay-at-home official orders in Vermont. The survey was
completely anonymous, and consisted of 9 questions combining multiple-choice and open-ended questions,
regarding the use of, and value of, the urban and peri-urban natural areas to local users and how these use
and values interact with restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The online survey could be
completed in less than five minutes, and access to it was made public through information sheets at the
beginning of the main walking trails and entrance ways to these areas. These sheets contained a brief
explanation of the purpose of the survey, a QR code and a website address to access the survey. Upon
accessing the online survey, the participants encountered a detailed explanation of the aims of the survey,
as well as complete information on how the data would be managed. The ethical standards of this study
were approved by the University of Vermont’s Research Protections Office and the Committees on Human

4

Subjects (UVM STUDY00000892). After one month, the survey was then sent out to various list servers
linked to these natural areas (e.g. Burlington Parks and Recreation - who manage many of these areas - sent
the survey to their subscribed patrons). Roughly half of the sample accessed the survey from the trailheads.
The other half of the sample accessed the survey through a weblink sent out to various list serves that serve
the different park managers. Our two phase roll out had at least two impacts on the results. Data for Figure
5 (see below) was collected as an open-ended question in phase 1, and then these answers were used to
create answer options in phase 2. Data for Figure 6 comes specifically from the second phase (n=224), as
we refined the survey to more clearly understand group visiting patterns.

2.2. Study sites
The University of Vermont (UVM) owns and manages ten natural areas across the state of Vermont. These
natural areas encompass more than 1,023 ha, host 49 different natural community types, and are home to
more than 900 documented species, 12.5% of which are rare and endangered for the region (Natural Areas
Lab, 2019; UVM, 2019). These areas are used for academic purposes, but are also open to the general public
for recreation. Most of these natural areas are in the immediate vicinity of the city of Burlington and its
metropolitan area, which concentrates roughly 214,000 people, approximately one third of the total
population of the state (U.S. Census Bureau, 2019). There are other parks and natural areas in and around
the city of Burlington managed by different entities such as Burlington Parks, Recreation & Waterfront
(BPRW), the Intervale (I), the Episcopal Church in Vermont (ECV), or the Winooski Valley Park District
(WVPD). The combination of these natural areas managed by UVM and by other entities, represent an
important source of non-material ecosystem services for those who seek a short break from urban life, in
particular under the restrictions imposed due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

For this study, we focused on the 7 natural areas managed by UVM that lay within the immediate
surroundings of the Burlington metropolitan area, and 18 parks and natural areas managed by other entities
(Figure 1). All 25 areas have hiking/walking trail systems within them, some more extensive than others.
Each one of these areas is characterized by a different set of ecosystems, geomorphology, and species
compositions. However, in general terms, the main ecosystems found across these areas are peatlands,
swamps, wetlands, and open waters; forests of conifers, broadleaved trees, and mixed forests; and open
fields, bushlands, and some agricultural lands.

natural areas.
3. Results
In the ten weeks of survey data collection (March 28 - June 8) we received 403 valid responses representing
visits to our 25 urban and peri-urban natural areas and parks. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic the average
respondent visited local natural areas around 1.62 times per week and 74% of the sample visited such areas
between daily and monthly (Figure 2). In our sample, almost twice as many respondents (46; 11%) had
never before visited these natural areas as compared to those who visited daily (27; 7%).

6

Figure 2. Frequency of visits to the local natural areas prior to the COVID-19.
Almost half of the sample (46%) said they had “increased” their visitation rates to these natural areas, and
an additional 23% claimed to have “greatly increased” their visitation rate (Figure 3a). Only 7.5% reported
their use of the natural areas had decreased and the remaining 21.5% reported no change in their use of the
natural areas during the first 10 weeks of the pandemic. In addition to a large reported increase in use of
natural areas in this time of pandemic, respondents also reported that their evaluated ‘value’ of being able
to access these areas also changed. The majority of respondents said that the importance of these natural
areas to them either “increased” (49.6%) or “greatly increased” (31.0%) during pandemic times (Figure
3b). Only two respondents reported that the value of these areas had decreased for them, with one of the
respondents indicating in an open-ended comment that they “don’t trust people to be respectful of physical
distancing” in the natural areas.

Figure 3. Changes in frequency and value of visits to natural areas during COVID-19 compared to preCOVID-19 times.
While the majority of this convenience sample visited natural areas at least weekly, 26% of the survey
respondents visited these areas 1-2 times per year or had never visited pre-COVID-19. Of these first-time
or infrequent visitors, 69% of them ranked the importance of having access to such areas during COVID19 as very important, the highest option (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Importance of visiting natural areas during COVID-19 to first time or infrequent visitors.
We asked the respondents why they ‘valued and visited’ these areas. The respondents had the opportunity
to check off as many pre-defined reasons as appropriate, but also to add their own reasons. There were over
30 unique responses to this question, but the most common answers included simply getting outside,
exercise, connecting to nature, finding peace and quiet, finding contemplative space, dog walking, time
with children and birding (Figure 5).

Figure 5. Key reasons, as stated by the respondents, for visiting the natural areas under study.
Finally, we wanted to see if the pandemic had changed the pattern of how people visit these areas with
respect to the size of the groups they visit with (Figure 6). Pre-COVID-19, respondents predominantly
visited these places alone or with one other person (67.9%). For the majority (61.2%), the pandemic did not
change the pattern of their visitorship. However, for 27.2% of the sample, COVID-19 drove respondents to
decrease their party size in these areas. Interestingly, for 11.2% of the sample, the size of their groups
increased during COVID-19. This aligns with the fact that 17% (Figure 5) of the sample reported that these
natural areas allowed them safe spaces to socialize during the global pandemic.

4. Discussion and conclusion
In this study, we designed and implemented a survey to collect information regarding the non-material
benefits people obtain from urban and peri-urban natural areas, and how the benefits and the values that
people attribute to them change in times of social crisis (e.g. under the restrictions imposed due to the
COVID-19 pandemic). Our rapid, descriptive case study provides empirical evidence in support of other
evidence (e.g. data collected by private companies via cell phone localization), that the need for, and use
of, nature has increased during this time of pandemic (see Goodier and Rayman, 2020).

We found that people in our survey increased the frequency of their visits to natural areas during the
COVID-19 social distancing restrictions, and that this increase included about 26% of respondents who
would be considered rare-to-first-time visitors. Visitors pointed to their lack of other options, limited social
acceptance of driving (for other hikes) and additional leisure time as reasons for their increased frequency
of visitation. However, in addition to those structural enabling conditions, respondents also expressed that
their increased visits were a function of needing a “calm spot in a time of chaos,” and having additional
time to connect with nature and their families actively. So while the majority of the sample continued to
visits these spaces with the same size groups as pre-COVID (typically alone or with another one person),
slightly over a quarter of the sample reduced the size of their visiting group during COVID-19 and 11%
increased the size of their group. These results can imply that 1) for the majority of the sample socialdistancing or group size restrictions did not affect their typical habits 2) for some of the sample they
decreased their sociality during visits (i.e. smaller numbers) and 3) some of the sample used the natural
areas as a safe space for increasing their social interactions via use natural areas. All of these dimensions
will be important as the pandemic continues or more come down the line - i.e. people will want to continue
some parts of their lives as business as usual; people will need more space (e.g. for peace, contemplation
etc. Fig 5); people will need safe spaces to be social when so many other outlets are closed to them.

Our respondents also indicated that COVID-19 has forced them to re-evaluate and almost unanimously
elevate their value for such spaces. 81% of respondents reported that the importance of such spaces to them
increased or greatly increased since the onset of COVID-19 social and work restrictions. Comments ranged
from the simple “More important now since it is one of the only things I’m allowed to do” to the heartfelt
“I cannot express to you in words how important these areas are to me.” Close to a dozen respondents
specifically mention the increased “mental health” benefits of their increased time in natural areas. Such
self-reported value boosts from nature support recent observed findings from twitter analysis that people
visiting urban green spaces, such as the ones investigated here, have lower negativity and higher sentiment
and that visits to such places could have effects that extend beyond parks limits (Schwartz et al., 2019). In

12

our survey 268 (66%) people reported that they utilized these natural areas to find peace and quiet, 130
(32%) reported these places as spaces for contemplation - activities that have been shown to reduce stress
and rumination. As such access to our urban and peri-urban natural areas may be delivering these mental
health precursors during a time when they are most needed.

If our results hold true in other regions, demand for urban and peri-urban greenspace is increasing just at
the time we are seeing losses of urban and peri-urban natural areas or vacillating priority for such areas in
parts of China (Wang et al., 2020), and the United States (McDonald et al., 2010). In addition to the potential
loss of such spaces in times of need, we know that in many places, access to urban green space is unequal
with several US cities showing that access to urban green space is a function of income and race, i.e.
negatively correlated with poor and being a person of color (Nesbitt et al., 2019). Given that COVID-19, at
least in the USA is more likely to negatively impact people in lower income brackets, the lack of access to
green space may compound the more diffuse, yet pernicious effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (Larson et
al., 2016a; Laster Pirtle, 2020).

In our study, respondents indicated over 30 unique activities and drivers of their welfare provided by natural
areas, from the most common “just getting outside” to the deeper and more abstract statements of those
who find it important as a “contemplative space” in times of global chaos. The results also highlighted that
many of the visitors to natural areas had either gone for the first time, or had been for the first time in
months or years. Of the 41 respondents who had never been to any of these natural areas before COVID19, 21 of them reported that they would be visiting more frequently. Our study was not designed to evaluate
the persistence of importance to users over time, however, 29% of the sample were either interested in the
results, or provided positive support for the existence and access to the natural areas by offering their emails
and offering open-ended comments. We suggest this indicates a deeper engagement with these areas then
simply responding to a survey.

Our study was conducted in Vermont, a state known for its relatively low population density, extensive
forests and natural landscapes, and a high number of people that link their leisure time to perform outdoor
activities (OIA, 2017). Thus, a similar study implemented in regions with higher population densities or
with other attitudes toward nature, might yield somewhat different results. Our sample is a convenience
sample of people visiting the natural areas and is not representative of the wider population and carries with
it the limitations of self-reported data (Jager et al., 2017). As such our approach has likely biased the sample
towards over-representing frequent visitors of these natural areas, and certainly biased this sample by
missing those visitors that have stopped visiting during COVID-19. However, the aim was to first see if

13

visitors increased their use during this time and second, to see if the value for these areas increased. In both
cases our results point in the affirmative direction. This study did not address issues related to income,
education, or race which are certainly important avenues of inquiry for further studies.

Global pandemics such as COVID-19 are predicted to increase in frequency in the future (Fan et al., 2019),
our results show that people seek out urban and peri-urban natural areas to help mitigate the adverse impacts
through the provision of places and spaces that can deliver non-material ecosystem services and human
welfare benefits in a time of crises. Purported health benefits of access to and utilization of urban and periurban natural areas have included cardiovascular health (Tamosiunas et al., 2014), mental health outcomes
(Annerstedt et al., 2012), improved pulmonary function (Lee and Lee, 2014), in so-called-normal times.
Other authors have studied the effects of using nature as a therapy for physical and mental disorders (e.g.
Poulsen, 2017; Poulsen et al., 2018), or have analyzed the role of natural settings for individual crisis
rehabilitation (e.g. Ottosson and Grahn, 2008). We will need longer term research and more direct
observational and biometric-based studies to get a deeper handle on the differential impacts of such spaces
during times like COVID-19, however it seems safe to assume that demand for, and the beneficial effects
of, such spaces on physical and mental health can only increase. Future research could focus on i) the
differential effects of benefits across people of different agency, income, race and culture ii) the justice and
equity in access to such benefits iii) the interactions between the benefit of urban and peri-urban natural
areas and the various impacts of future pandemics (isolation; cardiovascular health; unemployment;
depression) and iv) the persistence of these health and non-material benefits to new ‘users’ of natural
areas.
Urban and peri-urban natural areas have been shown to be important in ‘normal’ times (Chiesura, 2004;
Gómez-Baggethun and Barton, 2013) and in times of crisis (Mabon, 2019; Sachdeva et al., 2018) and
upheaval (Gladkikh et al., 2019). Our results corroborate observations on the importance of natural areas
in time of crises. With the spectre of an increasing frequency of such crises like COVID-19, natural area
and ecosystem management budgets should be safeguarded and potentially increased as a tool to maintain
and improve human welfare in times of crises, even as we see major contractions in our economic
foundations.
