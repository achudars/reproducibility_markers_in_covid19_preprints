"10" "Abstract"
"11" "As the COVID-19 pandemic  spread throughout the world in early 2020, many country leaders endorsed social distancing policies to reduce transmission. Public face masking policies, however, were only endorsed by a few countries in eastern Asia until recently. Herein ,  we review the theory and evidence behind public face masking and social distancing. We find a complete absence of adequate randomized trials for  social distancing and only a few for public masking , but similar levels of evidence that both interventions could work to reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Given the similar levels of evidence, it is strange that social distancing was promoted in the absence of public face masking policies, particularly so with the detrimental emotional, social, and economic side effects that social distancing entails. In the future, possible interventions to combat pandemic illness should be evaluated against the entire body of evidence rather than upon the absence or presence of adequate randomized trials."
"12" "Introduction"
"13" "The SARS-CoV-2 virus and its associated disease , COVID-19,  has spread throughout the world in a global pandemic. As of March 29, 2020 there were just over 700,000 known cases of COVID-19 and 33,500 known deaths from the illness  worldwide   (1) .  A week later on April 4, 2020 there were more than  1.1 million known cases of 59,000 confirmed deaths from COVID-19 worldwide   (1) .  SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, spreading primarily through  droplet  transmission."
"14" "Numerous efforts are ongoing in both the development of vaccines  to prevent illness  as well as the development of drug therapies for those that get infected. Without a vaccine  or evidence-based pharmaceutical therapy , prevention relies on non-pharmaceutical or public health interventions.  Early in the pandemic ,  the  WHO  endorsed social distancing and hand washing/sanitization as the primary means of curbing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.  Public face masking was recommended in China and Hong Kong,  where it has been culturally accepted prior to the pandemic,  but discouraged in the USA, UK, and Germany   (2) .   On April 3, 2020 ,  the US CDC suggested that public face masking may provide some benefit."
"15" "Herein ,  we review the  theory and  evidence for  public masking and social distancing to potentially decrease  SARS-CoV-2 transmission.  Handwashing to prevent respiratory infection has been reviewed in detail elsewhere  and is well accepted  throughout the world  to be an important intervention for respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2   (3,4) .   Our analysis relies  heavily but not exclusively on the US CDC repository of scientific studies of non-pharmaceutical interventions  ( https://www.cdc.gov/nonpharmaceutical-interventions/tools-resources/published-research.html ).   We exclude modeling studies as evidence,  because  models are built on assumptions derived from theory and  epidemiological evidence .  We further discuss the policy decisions that have been made in response to SARS-CoV-2  amid  the available evidence for each public health intervention.  To date n o scientific studies have been conducted that have examined the effect of these interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and so  the majority of  conclusions drawn here are from other types of respiratory illness with similar manners of  transmission ."
"16" "Public face masking to reduce respiratory virus transmission"
"17" "Definition"
"18" "Public face masking refers to the encouragement  by  health officials for community members to wear respiratory masks in community settings regardless of symptoms. The behavior is more common in eastern Asian cultures such as China, South Korea, and Taiwan."
"19" "Theory"
"20" "Public face masking theoretically drives down respiratory virus transmission in two ways  – personal protection  (reducing acquisition)  and source reduction  (reducing transmission) .  More commonly appreciated, wearing a face mask provides personal protection against respiratory viruses. In theory, when healthy people are wearing face masks in public then the number of susceptible people in the population decreases and acquisition decreases as a result. The  mask’s  physical barrier prevents  or decreases  acquisition by stopping airborne or droplet viruses from entering the body through the nose or mouth. Different materials provide different levels of protection against microscopic viruses, and since their invention in 1897, improvements in the design and materials of face masks have enhanced their level of protection   (5,6) ."
"21" "A perhaps even more important manner in which public face masking  theoretically reduces transmission is through source reduction.   Many  r espiratory pathogens are presumed to follow a transmission route of inhalation of or direct contact with large respiratory droplet particles, which extend no more than a few feet from the source. However, pathogens which remain viable in the air could remain suspended, or “aerosolized” for longer periods of time, with the possibility of inhalation by a person who has not had close contact with the source   (5,7) .  There are recent data to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may become aerosolized, especially under certain conditions where respiratory secretions are forcefully ejected   (8) .  In fact, newer data suggest that several pathogens may follow a more mixed pattern of droplet formation and aerosolization,  by travelling  within what is referred to as a turbulent cloud   (7) .  The speed and distance the cloud travels  depends  not only on the size of the pathogen itself, but  also  on factors such as the force of expulsion and the local environmental conditions."
"22" "The face mask , when properly worn, is expected to  prevent  or decrease  virus transmission from the person with the infection by decreasing the dispersal of infectious droplets   (9) .  Thus far ,  there appears to be substantial transmission from pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and even asymptomatic SARS-Cov-2 infections, particularly among young people   (10–15) .  Therefore, in theory ,  when people are wearing face masks in public then the  amount  of infectious droplets expelled from those infected decreases, resulting in lower transmission  (Figure  1 ) .  A grim report of a choir practice in Washington state possibly being the source of a super-spreading event for SARS-CoV-2 provides an example of how people who are not coughing or sneezing may inadvertently aerosolize a pathogen   (16) .  It stands to reason that formation of the turbulent cloud is highly likely to be substantially inhibited by the wearing of a mask on the part of an un-knowing person who is asymptomatically infected with SARS-CoV-2   (7) ."
"23" "Figure 1: A conceptual framework of how masking the public works acts as  transmission  reduction of infection. Two important points: 1) a large portion of transmission is asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic and so mass public masking is only way to mask these individuals, and 2) masks are not 100% effective at blocking viral particles."
"24" "Evidence"
"25" "Historical  observational  studies"
"26" "The earliest systematic investigations into face masks to prevent the spread of infectious disease come from early 20 th  century. Physicians who regularly wore cloth masks during  the  Manchurian  pneumonic  plague  ( Yersinia pestis )  epidemic from 1910-1911 sustained lower mortality  rates  than sanitary attendants and ambulance staff who did not   (17) .   In Chicago , placing cloth face masks on nurses  in 1918  eliminated scarlet fever transmission and reduced diphtheria transmission by 65%   (18) .  In a  nearby  military hospital  that same year , placing face masks  on  patients reduced scarlet fever transmission by 95% and eliminated measles transmission   (19) .  These studies can only provide limited evidence due to their design: a simple ecological study in the case of  pneumonic  plague and pre-post evaluations without comparison in the latter two studies. However, face masking for healthcare workers became widely established shortly after these studies   (5,6) ."
"27" "Modern  experimental and  observational studies"
"28" "Most  policy makers  accept that wearing a mask while sick prevents further transmission  of respiratory viruses, although, this is surprisingly understudied   (20,21) .   T here is strong evidence, that health care workers wearing masks prevents both transmission and acquisition of  nosocomial  respiratory viruses   (22–25) .   H ealth care workers are in close contact with vulnerable people or highly contagious people. These situations are high risk for transmission ,  in either direction ,   which  necessitate the use of masks ."
"29" "There is limited  evidence  surroun ding public masking.  Two studies (by the same first author) have been conducted in college residence halls that prospectively randomized students to wear masks, wear masks and a hand hygiene intervention , or   no promotion of either intervention  during 6 weeks of an influenza season   (26,27) .   Masking was associated with lower upper respiratory symptoms towards the end of the study period   (26,27) .  There are several cluster randomized controlled trials that had contacts  wear masks after the diagnosis of a confirmed influenza case  or influenza-like-illness  in the household   (28–34) .   Most of these trials demonstrated that household mask wearing was not more effective than the control at preventing influenza acquisition in household contacts   (28–31) .  A few  found  that masks  did prevent acquisition ,  especially when compliance was high   (32–34) .  However, these studies are  not ideal to examine the policy of public face masking , in that masks are only given after the influenza diagnosis has been made. This is problematic because influenza transmission happens during the early stages of infection and illness.  Ideally communities would be randomized  to wear the masks prior to the influenza  season , which would require larger , longer,  and more expensive  trials .  Additionally, these  published  trials assume that all mask wearers are healthy and do not consider the benefits  of  public  masking  when the public is a combination of healthy and infected people.  No such  trials  have been conducted , although the methods for a promising population based cluster randomized trial have been described, but as yet, the results have not been published   (35) ."
"30" "A few observational cohort and cross-sectional studies have found masks among the public and health care workers to prevent acquisition of influenza and SARS -CoV-1   (36–38) .   There are numerous case-control studies suggesting that wearing masks  by both the  public  and health care workers  prevented acquisition of SARS -CoV-1   (39–45) .  A systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies found wearing a mask to be protective   (46) .   However, these studies are often discounted as people who are more likely to wear masks in public tend to have better infection prevention hygiene practices overall   (47,48) .  Finally, when the public of Hong Kong practiced masking during the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 outbreak there was  a significant decline of transmission of non-SARS infectious diseases such as influenza and others   (49) .  It is impossible to separate out public masking from social distancing that occurred at the time, however."
"31" "Social distancing to reduce respiratory virus transmission"
"32" "Definition"
"33" "Social distancing refers to decreasing the number of contacts with people outside of one’s household. Social distancing is  brought about  through school and business closures as well as limitations on the number of people allowed together in the same place.  The most extreme social distancing is through shelter in place policies, where people only leave their home for essential supplies or due to necessary employment."
"34" "Theory"
"35" "Most i nfectious diseases spread from human to human, sometimes through a  disease vector.  Therefore social contact patterns are an important aspect of how infectious diseases spread   (50) .   Contacts can be  categorized into casual or intimate  categories .  Whereas casual contacts are random   (51) ,  i ntimate contacts are stable over time  and have  a pattern to them, perhaps through school, work, or in the household   (52) .   Further, contact patterns are assortative with age (i.e., adults mix with adults and children mix with children), with high levels of mixing at schools and workplaces   (53–55) ."
"36" "Only a handful of studies have shown a link between social mixing and the risk of infectious disease.  For example, a cross a number of sub-Saharan African countries, s ocial mixing  was  associated with increased  probability of recent symptoms of  an acute respiratory infection   (56) .  In southwest Uganda ,  a n increase in the number and frequency of close contacts increased the risk of  Streptococcus pneumoniae  carriage and illness   (57) .   And  more social mixing was associated with the odds of having a past infection for influenza  across  various countries   (58,59) ."
"37" "Other studies are suggestive that social mixing increases the risk of an infectious disease but did not quantify social mixing  nor elucidate the link  directly.  For example, a mong school children, having siblings  (an indicator of more social mixing within a household) was associated with being ill in the previous six months   (60) .  In Guinea Bissau, large households with many young children (an indicator of more social mixing of young children) maintain transmission of Varicella zoster (chicken pox)   (61) .  And various other  modeling  studies have explored how social contact patterns fuel the spread of disease   (62–64) ."
"38" "The theory of social distancing as an intervention to stop the spread of disease is to decrease the number and frequency of social contacts, particularly of intimate contacts outside of the home. Figure  2  represents a social network of a household of four, with intimate contacts at both the workplace and at school. As that household practices social distancing, the risk of introduction of an infectious disease from intimate contacts outside the household decreases. Only remaining is the risk of introduction of an infectious disease from casual contacts outside the household."
"39" "Figure 2: A conceptual diagram of  a household of four individuals (orange circles) and their contacts (blue circles). Solid lines represent intimate contact patterns and dashed single lines represent casual contact patterns. When social distancing is in place (red  X ) ,  intimate contact patterns from the workplace and school are interrupted and only casual contact patterns remain."
"40" "Evidence"
"41" "Historical observational studies"
"42" "Society responded to the great influenza pandemic of 1918 in a variety of ways, including differing levels of social distancing in different communities. Across the US, variations in both the timing of social distancing interventions and the type of social distancing  policies  from school closures, public gathering bans, and combinations were associated with decreased levels of influenza-related mortality, with early intervention being the most effective   (65–67) .  Specifically, early closure of schools, churches, or theatres decreased the mortality from influenza   (66) .  In Australia, social distancing policies also had an impact on influenza transmission, particularly related to subsequent waves of infection   (68) ."
"43" "Modern observational studies"
"44" "Modern observational studies of the impact of social distancing  almost exclusively examine the impact of  school closures  on influenza and influenza-like-illness , with  very  few epidemiological investigations of workplace social distancing .   Before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, broad closures of society had not occurred in living memory  and workplace closures are quite rare .  Researchers examined access to paid sick leave, which presumably leads to staying home when ill  (an alarmingly rare behavior)   (69,70) ,  and  found that these policies were associated with a decreased incidence of influenza-like illness across the US   (71) .  In Japan, a  workplace study  of two separate car industries  found that  having employees work from home if anyone in their household came down with an influenza-like illness reduced the risk of the other employees of contracting influenza by 20%   (72) ."
"45" "Studies assessing the impact of school closures on respiratory illness transmission are much more common, including a number of systematic reviews   (73–75) .   Schools certainly contribute to the transmission patterns of respiratory infections, and may even drive the spread of these illnesses   (76) .   At an individual level, school closure is associated with a decrease in respiratory illness among school children   (77) .   At the population level, school closures for reasons unrelated to respiratory illnesses provide various natural experiments of the impact of school closure on respiratory illness.  Routine school closure for holidays has been shown to be associated with decreased influenza incidence in Arizona   (78) ,  and reducing the transmission of influenza-like illness across Argentina   (79) ,   China   (80) ,  France   (81) ,  India   (82) ,  the US   (83) .  Unrelated to holidays,  In Israel,  the year of a teacher strike had lower influenza incidence among school children aged 6-12 but not for older individuals compared to the two years before and after the teachers’ strike   (84) .   As a precaution against influenza spread, results of school closures are more mixed.  Closing school in reaction to cases of influenza during the  2009  H1N1 influenza pandemic was found to be protective in  small studies  in Japan  and Texas   (85,86) ,  but not in a small study in Kentucky   (87) ,  nor across the state of Michigan   (88) ."
"46" "Discussion"
"47" "Key results"
"48" "The scientific evidence for public masking and aggressive social distancing is quite similar in nature. No adequate randomized trials of either intervention have been conducted, and so the evidence available includes the mechanistic process, historical observational studies, and modern observational studies.   The  mechanistic process for face masks has been  studie d , and they have shown to effectively reduce viral loads from the infected. For social distancing, this mechanistic process has not been well studied, as it is a fundamental given that a person cannot contract a viral infection unless that person comes into contact with a viral pathogen. Historical observational studies of face masks showed that they were effective, and  sufficiently  effective that they have evolved into the N95 respirators , which are heavily relied upon by health care workers during this  current pandemic   (89) .  Studying the 1918 great influenza pandemic, albeit with modern statistical methods, also suggests that social distancing when practiced early can greatly reduce the transmission of a respiratory illness.  Concerning modern epidemiological studies, there simply is a  dearth  of studies that have been conducted for either intervention, with the exception of school closures. Given the frequency of school closures from holidays and non-illness related events, it is  understandable that there is so much evidence that school closures can reduce the transmission of respiratory illnesses. However, not much epidemiological evidence exists for other types of social distancing, and the same is true of public face masking. The case-control studies of wearing a face mask refer to the personal protection, and are likely biased in that people wearing a face mask are likely more conscientious regarding their hygiene behavior.  T he epidemiological evidence is weak for  both public masking and social distancing  (excluding school closures).  However,  the body of evidence for either intervention is similar, in that their effectiveness is mechanistically probable, the interventions worked to some degree historically, and the limited epidemiological evidence that exists suggests that they both are effective."
"49" "Interpretation"
"50" "Given  the evidence of both public masking and social distancing  is so similar , why was one intervention favored above another?  Considering the huge social, emotional, and economic ramifications of social distancing, favoring that policy without public face masking is quite strange.  We consider  a variety of  reasons why the scientific community and policy makers  might have chosen  to promote social distancing rather than public masking early in th is pandemic ."
"51" "One of the consistent findings from studies of social distancing is that the actions need to be early to be effective. Waiting ha s  been shown to limit the effectiveness of social distancing in the analyses of the great influenza pandemic and school closures, and so policy makers were appropriately motivated to begin social distancing early.  For  the delay in the public masking policies ,  it appears that policy makers may have been overly reliant on  randomized studies  to drive decisions.  This over-reliance on randomization has been described as a “one-legged stool”  and detrimental to the progress of science   (90) .   There has been so much focus on r esults of randomized studies as representing the “ strongest ” evidence that the findings about the effectiveness of face masks from non - randomized  or mechanistic  studies were given lesser attention or credence.  For new interventions, and certainly novel drug therapies  and vaccines , the randomized trial is an important piece of the evidence. But for old interventions, randomized  controlled  trials are simply not available.  The randomized controlled trial was extremely rare until the mid- to late- 20 th  century   (90) .  With face mask s  being first used in the early 20 th  century, by the time a randomized controlled trial of face masks compared to no face masks was designed , it  was considered unethical  to prevent health care workers or the public from wearing a face mask (a true negative control)   (91) ."
"52" "Bizarrely, while policy makers cited a lack of available evidence for public masking they did not cite a lack of available evidence for social distancing. To encourage social distancing ,  policymakers have instead utilized a factual mechanistic approach without falling back to the fallacy that without randomized studies ,  we cannot know if the intervention may work. If people do not have contact with the virus ,  then  transmission may  not  occur. The way infectious disease modeling handles public face masking and social distancing may have reinforced the discrepancy between how the two policies were initially viewed.  Infectious disease models rely on a reproductive number, that is derived from characteristics of the infectious disease as well as the social mixing in the population. Therefore, s ocial distancing enters into many infectious disease models through the social contact structure, rather than as an intervention. Public face masking enters into many infectious disease models as an intervention. While a protective efficacy is needed for an intervention to be modeled (most often derived from a meta-analysis of randomized trials), no such requirement exists for adjusting the contact structure through social distancing."
"53" "Face masks are most often viewed as personal protection, despite their  potential  role in source reduction. Policy makers may not have been aware of the true nature of  the  spread  of SARS-CoV-2  from infected individuals, as they recommended masks for the sick but not for the general population. While it is generally appreciated that symptomatic infected individuals are a source of spread of viral infections ,  it   may  not have been fully appreciated the extent to which asymptomatic but infected individuals may spread the SARSC o V - 2 virus. However, early case reports of apparent transmission during the incubation period for the virus in Germany   (92) ,  as well  as  a case study of asymptomatic transmission in China   (14)  were available in January and February, respectively.  Therefore,  the policy of people known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 to wear masks but not for the general public was troubling, especially after  research published in March suggested that undocumented infections (i.e., not-yet-diagnosed, mildly symptomatic ,  or asymptomatic carriers) were the source of over 80 per cent of documented COVID-19 cases in Hubei Province in January 2020   (93) ."
"54" "Beyond the scientific evidence influencing the differences in the policy decisions, the reluctance to recommend the wearing of masks early on in the pandemic may be due to a lack of preparation in terms of having enough supplies of masks for both the general population and ,  most importantly ,  for health care workers.  There may be some credence to this particular motivation.  For example, recently the Executive Director of the WHO ,  Mike Ryan ,  reiterated “There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit”   (94) .  As  we indicate herein  there is  as much evidence  for the effectiveness of masks  as there is  for social distancing.  In the same press report ,  the WHO Executive Director emphasized the need to preserve masks for use by health personnel as a reason for not advocating for population mask use. This then begs the question :  if wearing masks are vital for  the sick with symptoms of COVID-19  then why would it not also be of benefit to individuals  infected with SARS-CoV-2 but without symptoms  in the community?  Perhaps the concern is not so much with the lack of evidence for masks  but a  fear  of a lack of masks  for front line health care workers."
"55" "We do not necessarily know the reasons why policy around public  masking was delayed  (and still not endorsed by the WHO)  but policy around social distancing was promoted early .   More troubling  is  that  western countries such as the USA and western Europe  did not take cues from the  eastern countries such as China, South Korean, and Japan  in terms of interventions utilized  in response to the pandemic . In 2003, SARS-CoV-1 killed  774 people  in  11  countries. Dealing with  that epidemic  has prepared both the people as well as the public health systems in  those eastern countries  in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 ."
"56" "The se   eastern countries’   current  success with containment of  SARS-CoV-2  may be, in part, attributed to cultural factors that go beyond the methods employed to stop transmission. Eastern cultures are highly collectivist in nature, whereas the west is more individualist.   Collectivist cultures derive value from the group or community. Individuals are viewed as inextricably linked within the group, and, therefore, the interests of the group take precedence over the interests of the individual. Collectivist cultures view the needs of the group as the utmost priority. Therefore, individuals are likely to see adjustments to their behavior to avoid transmission as being ultimately motivated by protecting the group as a whole. As such, adjusting behavior is seen as a positive way to contribute to the group. Individualist cultures derive value from individual success and freedom. Individuals have firm boundaries with others and individual goals take priority over group goals. Individualist cultures are more likely to focus on the personal goal of not becoming infected, rather than the group goal of reducing infection rates overall. Additionally, behavioral adjustments are seen  as  infringements on personal liberties, which decreases motivation for and likelihood of engaging in behaviors aimed at reducing transmission.  A recent example of this is the protest in Michigan, USA against the social distancing restrictions imposed by the state government   (95) ."
"57" "Conclusion"
"58" "Public face masking should have been promoted as an intervention against SARS-CoV-2 from the outset, in conjunction with social distancing policies. There is a similar level of evidence for public face masking, as there is for social distancing, and decisions to promote social distancing but not public face masking were a misstep."
