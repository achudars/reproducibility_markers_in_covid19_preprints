Abstract
The outbreak of the present pandemic coronavirus (official designation COVID-19 or SARSCoV-2) has a clear negative impact on academic and research activities. Issues created by such
pandemic viz. loss of communication; shut down of school, college and universities; disruption
of the formal learning process; damage of print materials, etc. provoke the transformation of
the learning process from conventional to digital. A sophisticated & multitasking platform for
online learning is the primary requirement of this transformation, which conforms to the 5A's
of access, i.e., Availability, Adequacy, Accessibility, Affordability, and Appropriateness. It
bridges the digital divide by ensuring equal access to the web for all. In this paper, the authors
have conducted a comparative analysis between the most commonly used web-conferencing
tools (viz. FCC, ZOOM, GTM, Join.me & Cisco WebEx) in India, both in terms of users’ &
economic perspective. The Users’ perspective was determined by conducting a short online
survey using a Google form questionnaire. The survey contains 450 respondents equally
distributed among three sample groups, viz. Students, faculty members & library professionals.
And the Economical compatibility is identified by solely using the tools & check their pricing
& plans. After evaluation & comparison, the study identified that the tool FCC (Free
Conference Call), can use by learners and educators as an alternative solution to the physical
classroom. This is a dissemination or sharing platform and the most versatile and
comprehensive free web-conferencing solution which can be used by academic institutions and
educators for online classes. Besides, this paper also goes through a basic overview of 5 A’s of
access and provides sufficient evidence that FCC meets all the five criteria of accessibility to
clarify the judgment of its acceptance.

1. Introduction
The spread of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 has wreaked havoc on social contact and
organization worldwide, and the education sector is no exception [1]. Both the direct and
indirect effects of education are a subject risk to such a pandemic. This COVID-19 pandemic
is neither the first and confidently nor the last epidemic that will pose a threat to the
conventional education system. Instead, efforts should be made to find measures that can ensure
the continuation of the education system for posterity. The virtual online classroom may be an

alternate solution to this problem which offers many benefits. Such a transition is difficult in
India because Indian students and academicians are more accustomed to the conventional
classroom-based study system. Sometimes their knowledge and skill also not efficient enough
with the online teaching-learning environment. In such a scenario, Indian users find it difficult
to choose the best and most affordable platform as per their requirements. To address this
problem, the current study compared the most widely used web-conferencing tools in India
(FCC, ZOOM, GTM, Join.me, and Cisco WebEx) from both a user and a financial standpoint.

2. Statement of the problem
Because of these unprecedented times of COVID-19 Pandemic, the recent UGC circular
(dated 1st July 2020) issued to the Vice-Chancellors of all the Universities having Human
Resource Development Centres (HRDCs) regarding “Conduct of courses/programmes in
Online Mode” [2]. In addition to the Online Courses, all the HRDCs shall also organize
Capacity Building Short-term Training Programs for Teachers on Using ICT for Online
Teaching-Learning Process. As a pre-requisite for switching over to online mode, it has to be
understood that online education is a viable tool for reaching a large number of participants.
Such virtual learning systems should have visual appeal making online classes an inviting,
pleasant place to be. Participants need to be sensitized in advance through introductory lectures
relating to MOOCS and online delivery mode-related challenges in pedagogy for continued
interest in these programmes along with their solutions. Resource persons shall be able to
present text, videos, or links to other sources downloadable by the participants. Engaging the
learner participant in conversations and increasing collaboration through discussion with
resource persons and peer-to-peer support anytime, anywhere [3]. As in India conventional
learning process is more common than the online one. At the primary stage of lockdown, it
creates a tremendous problem for many academicians who can’t cope up with this uncertain
change. During the transition time of pandemic crises, commit to continuous improvement by
diligent pre-preparation and execution. Handling a small class or an educational event with
fewer participants can be efficiently done using popular applications such as Zoom, CiscoWebEx, Google Meet, and others. Any educational event with a large number of participants,
on the other hand, necessitates paid facilities, which might not be affordable to all HEIs,
including colleges and universities. The academicians & students are not capable of select the
best tools as per their requirement. In this context, this paper provides a brief comparison among
commonly known video-conferencing tools and also suggests the best. It should specify that
the evaluation & suggestions are purely basis on their price, usability & availability of features;
variation may occur.

3. The literature review
Learning is more effective, interactive, broad, not time-bound, and not patterned only in the
classroom [4]. For understanding the increasing use of video-conferencing tools, and their
benefits to improve the quality of education, here we discussed some prominent literature that
visualizes the use of video-conferencing tools and technologies in the present situation of the
pandemic COVID-19.
In their paper Lapitan et al., [5] discussed the shift to distance teaching and learning during
the COVID-19 pandemic, its challenges & difficulties, and the use of video-conferencing tools
e.g., Zoom or Google Meet for conducting the synchronous part of the teaching. Akers et al. [6]
examined the acceptance of MR spatial computing (Magic Leap One headsets) using an avatarmediated social interaction application (Spatial) over traditional 2D teleconferencing software

while adapting a fully remote classroom environment. Rahimi and Martin [7] identified the
challenges that arise due to the certain closure of educational institutions during the COVID19 pandemic and also suggest some strategies incorporating the use of learning management
systems, web conferencing software, and open-source software to mitigate these challenges.
Zao, Zhao and Siau [8] applied the eLearning usability heuristics to evaluate the major video
conferencing platforms (e.g., Cisco WebEx, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom). Xuedong et al. [9]
showed significant differences for Email, WhatsApp, and LandLine for contacting during
corona days, and Video Conferencing technology (e.g., Microsoft team, Zoom, TalnetLMS,
Schoology) used for distance learning. It not only helps policymakers in selecting the best
technology for teaching during corona days but also helps universities in attracting and
retention students through the use of technology. Khatib [10] carried out a literature review
focused on examining the potential of three different forms of video conferencing systems:
Desktop Video Conferencing (VCM), Interactive Video Conferencing (VCI), and Web Video
Conferencing (VCW) to provide an accessible and comprehensive learning experience before
the outbreak of COVID-19. Umacharan, Said, and Estabraq [11] discussed the broadcasting
platforms e.g., Google meet, Teems, WebEx, Hangouts, Zoom, FreeConferenceCall to distant
locations through video performances and also through indigenously advanced conferencing
platforms stand allied to complete with the internet, converting distance education or e-learning
as forthcoming cardinal erudition. The survey of Bui et al., [12] presented the behavioural
intention of Vietnamese female students (N=254) to use video conferencing tools (VCTs; e.g.,
Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Google Hangout) in the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, AlMaroof et al., [13] attempted to explore the effect of Google Meet acceptance among Arab
students (N=475) during the pandemic in Oman, UAE, and Jordan.

4. Study rationale
All of the above studies discussed some of the useful & familiar video-conferencing tools
and their usage benefits during coronavirus lockdown in teaching-learning platforms. However,
it can be identified that no such study has been conducted to test, evaluate, compare, analyze
and recommend the most affordable platform for helping institutions and organizations with
inadequate financial resources for acquiring such web-conferencing platform/software in
facing this abrupt outburst of e-learning after the COVID-19 eruption. Moreover, the addition
of actual users’ perspective and economical compatibility gives the study an extra value &
significance.
The study discusses the features of the web-conferencing tool FCC vis-a-vis other paid tools
in the light of the 5A's of access, i.e., Availability, Adequacy, Accessibility, Affordability, and
Appropriateness. The other tools used for comparison include GotoMeeting (GTM), Zoom, and
Join.me. Wherever possible step-by-step procedure of using FCC for hosting live events like
an online class, virtual meetings, etc., and other features have been provided.
The study objectives include:
To evaluate the features of FCC including Hosting, Screen share, Video conference, Chat,
Screen Recording, Broadcaster, and Integrations
To illustrate the features of Desktop App, Web App, and Mobile App.
To compare the features of FCC with other proprietary solutions like Zoom. GTM and
Join.me.

Usefulness of Free Conference Call (FCC) in Digital Learning Platform: A Comparative Study using Users’
Perception and Economical Compatibility

The research design of the current research was structured upon the investigation of two
research problems based on users’ perspective and economical perspective. The Users’
perspective was determined by conducting a short survey. The survey questionnaire was
designed upon a structured research questionnaire created through Google Form
(https://forms.gle/6p94MVp1ezggXi8m7) and circulated online via email to the targeted
sample groups viz, Students, Faculty Members & Library Professionals of all over India. It took
almost one month and distributed among 600 (almost) targeted sample groups of which 491
(98%) took part in this survey from a different region of India. Among which 450 (i.e., 150 for
each single sample type) was selected as the final sample.
The market is overloaded with different web-conferencing tools, all of which have a price
tag not aligning with the purchasing power of low-budget small organizations. The second part
of the study was conducted to identify a versatile, comprehensive, and pocket-friendly elearning/webinar/online meeting solution. User accounts were created in several videoconferencing platforms including Zoom, GoToMeeting (GTM), Join.me, FCC, Cisco WebEx,
etc. Desktop app, as well as mobile apps, were installed. Testing and evaluation were done for
each shortlisted platform on all the versions, i.e., web, desktop as-well-as m-app. Feature
comparisons were made considering the subscription cost. To identify the most affordable and
multi-functional tool, comparative tables were made. Selection criteria used include a
maximum number of concurrent participants that could be accommodated simultaneously, the
maximum duration for which the online session could be extended, security features, ease of
hosting and use, reporting, etc.

6. Data analysis
Data analysis and interpretation hold a crucial position in the research process. In the case
of Survey Data, after the data collection, it was imported as a .csv file (Google sheet) for further
analysis and visualization using spreadsheet software. Finally, the data analysis for the present
research was done quantitatively with the help of both descriptive statistics and inferential
statistics. It aims to organize, classify and summarize the data being collected for better
comprehension and interpretation leading to understand and explore answers or solutions to the
research problem which originally triggered the research. Data about the Economical
Perspective of the study collected after analyzing each available & common feature of the target
web-conferencing solution & their pricing structure.

7. Results analysis
The comparison among the selected web-conferencing tools is done using users’
perspectives and economic factors as comparative parameters. The respondents of the varied
disciplines may exhibit a wide range of attributes, behaviours, experiences, incidents, qualities,
situations, and so forth which facilitates gaining greater insights understanding the variation in
users’ perspectives.
7.1. User’s perspective
A tool’s effectiveness and efficiency can be measured by its functionality and services, but
its actual output can only be determined by the user’s viewpoint. As a result, the user’s
perspective is the most critical parameter to consider when evaluating a tool, as it is the only
way to determine the tool’s usability. The results of the user survey among the target sample
classes, namely students, faculty members, and library professionals, are shown in [Table 2].

FCC solely dominates others but have weakness in some specific features viz, ‘Live Chat’ and
‘One-Click Join. While Zoom selected as best in ‘Meeting Coordination’ & ‘Software Types’,
but don’t possess ‘Presentation’ and ‘Whiteboarding’ features. Again, Join.me in particular
identified as best in features like ‘Whiteboarding’ an ‘One-Click Join’. Overall, the result
indicates that in India users of all categories select FCC as the most effective web-conferencing
tool.
7.2. Economical compatibility
Economical compatibility or economic perspective or economic way of thinking; including
definitions of scarcity, opportunity cost, purposeful behavior, utility, marginal analysis
(benefits and costs), and how these concepts may be used in decision-making [14][pp. 3–25].
In the case of developing countries like India, an economic perspective is important while
selecting a tool for web-conferencing. So, in the second stage of the study compare affordability
among the targeted web-conferencing tools. The result of the comparative analysis is tabulated
under the following table 3 and divided into 6 sections according to the nature of the specific
features. [15][16][17][18][19]

Usefulness of Free Conference Call (FCC) in Digital Learning Platform: A Comparative Study using Users’
Perception and Economical Compatibility

FCC offers a truly free service and not a free trial for a certain duration. Accounts created on
FCC never expire and one account can be used for an unlimited number of classes. FCC
provides Call Detail Report (CDR) after every class and web conferencing via the email of the
educator and which is very useful to analyze how students progress in the class and
automatically marks the attendance. The report includes participant information such as time
spent on each call and other meeting details. In a single conference call, FCC can accommodate
a maximum of 1,000 participants. It also offers paid large meeting services allowing up to 5,000
participants. An event duration has a limit of six hours with an unlimited number of calls
allowed. It has the feature of canceling static or echo on a conference call. FCC provides the
benefit of collaborative video and screen sharing and increases productivity.
In an FCC virtual session [20],
⚫
hosts can access call controls on FCC, see the call list, display video, and share
computer screens, documents, web links, or presentations.
⚫
hosts can mute an individual participant using the Web Controls panel located on
the Meeting Wall or the Meeting Dashboard by selecting a participant from the
Attendee List and click Mute.
⚫
hosts can click Chat on the Meeting Dashboard to message the whole group or
private message an individual participant.
Also, FCC is compatible with a wide variety of devices and platforms for online webinars
including PCs, Macs®, Chromebooks™, iOS, and Android™ phones and tablets and also
provides the facility of Remote desktop access [21].

8. Findings and limitations
(1) The findings of the study both in terms of users’ perspective & economical compatibility
recommend that FCC can be used by the HEIs and HRDs for conducting online classes, FDPs,
RCs, OCs, and STTPs effectively, conveniently, and securely with high affordability.
(2) FCC provides the Desktop app, web app as well-as mobile app making a wider choice
available for the host and the participants.
(3) FCC is available on multiple OS platforms including macOS®, Windows, and Linux.
(4) As a mobile app, FCC is available for free download on Android and iOS platforms.
(5) FCC integrates with Google and Outlook Calendar through free download
extension/Plug-in.
(6) “FreeConferenceCall.com Scheduler” Chrome Extension for Google Calendar™
provides a quick and easy way to schedule a virtual meet by creating an event. Users can join
the meeting or host one from the Google Calendar event.
The findings of the study completely structured upon the above findings but with some
specified criteria. The research began with a focus on the free or trial versions of FCC, as well
as all other alternatives. So, the result of the findings shows a comparison between FCC and
the free versions or trial versions of each of the solutions. If we consider the pro versions of the
other tools like ZOOM or Cisco WebEx, it may suppress FCC in terms of services & facilities.
Thus, with considering an economical overview the study identifies FCC as the most efficient
& affordable web-conferencing tool. Again, the study has also a geographical limitation, i.e.,
only based on the viewpoint of the Indian user.

9. FCC and 5 A’s of access
The base of this paper depends on the primary requirements of internet facility and
knowledge of access in the web i.e., Digital Literacy. The term “digital literacy” is used to

describe the ability to harness the potential of digital tools [22]. In the process of transmission,
the learning process from conventional to digital equal access of web is also necessary because
as of the print material web also demands money for getting access and which creates a void
between the research and researcher, information and seeker, educator and learner, query and
the solutions. In the last decades, efforts to bridge the digital divide have focused on access,
i.e., ensuring that everyone is connected to the internet. Inequalities remain though: over half
the world population still doesn't have internet access, mostly underprivileged individuals in
both developing countries and industrialized countries. The last few years, in particular with
the emergence of e-government initiatives, made it clear that accessibility is as important an
issue [23]. The 5A's of access gives a theoretical framework of this bridging of the digital divide.

The 5 As

FCC

Availability

Whether services are available in the first place. For FCC availability, the FCC server
health was tested using https://uptime.com. The result, as displayed in fig. 1, depicts
high web server availability. Thus, FCC meets the

Adequacy

Whether there is an adequate and continued supply of available services. The
comparison table 2, depicts the adequacy of FCC owing to its richness of features even
in its free version with the capability of accommodating 1000 users and 6 hours of
generous meeting duration.

Accessibilit
y

Whether the services are effectively available for utilization. FCC is available for all
the popular OSS including macOS®, Windows, and Linux. For mobile devices, FCC
has its presence for Android™, iPhone®, iPad® or iPad Pro®. It supports wide
Integrations with Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook Calendar, Slack, Dropbox, and
Evernote. Thus, it can be inferred that FCC is Accessible. The availability of a free
version also endorses this point.

Affordabilit
y

Appropriate
ness

Affordability refers to the removal of financing burden for availing any important
service or solution and the product has its reach to the masses including those lacking
higher purchasing power. FCC fulfills these criteria as it allows its free usage without
financial obligation.
Service/product available must be relevant and useful to the user as well as
organizational needs and it should lead to meaningful and satisfactory outcomes. Here
also, FCC qualifies owing to the provision of all the major requirements of a webinar
or meeting as evident from the comparison table with the other such tools. Multiple
device support also strengthens this aspect.

The analysis of the paper suggests that web-conferencing tool FCC satisfies all the 5A's of
access and prove its impacts not only on academic and professional achievement, cognitive
development but also on social inclusion, empowerment, and citizenship, advocating for the
inclusion of a digital literacy capacity-building strategy for all in e-governments initiatives.

Usefulness of Free Conference Call (FCC) in Digital Learning Platform: A Comparative Study using Users’
Perception and Economical Compatibility

21st Century teaching and learning strategies related to the various methods used include the
use of appropriate tools with the latest technological developments to help students to
understand clearly the content of the subject [25]. But still, people resist change without
understanding the need and importance of it, and when a situation arises, all should adapt to
change willingly and unwillingly. This was the situation that occurred to the teaching fraternity
too. Indian higher education institution has used various pedagogy for innovation, development,
and engagement of students. Many faculties have resisted the change when they had been asked
to take virtual classes for students. And a couple of training was provided by the management
of the institutions hence faculty will not face any difficulties on the same. As everything exists
in the mindset, the mindset has to be changed towards the adoption and adaption of virtual
classrooms and adopt technology for the betterment of students [26].

11. Conclusion
In the current e-centric world every minute of a day we’re living during a data explosion and
have a very short time to analyze information, misinformation & disinformation before making
a decision. Moreover, as in India online study system and the use of the web-conferencing tools
is not so common for the student, faculty member, as well as library professionals; one user can
easily be confused and overwhelmed with so many options, and how to identify the best
solution [27]. To solve this specified problem, the current study thoroughly compared
commonly used web-conferencing tools in India, both in terms of Users’ perspective &
Economical compatibility. And, the result suggests the quality of FCC services can be more
than a match for paid counterparts. Moreover, FCC is a tool that conforms to 5A’s of access
i.e., Availability, Adequacy, Accessibility, Affordability, and Appropriateness; that bridges the
digital divide by ensuring equal access to the web for all. Again, though the study provides an
overview of the selection criteria of a web-conferencing tool but also lacks its appropriateness
in some points like regional limitations and the targeted sample versions. Last, it can be said
that in a situation of such disaster like the recent outbreak of COVID-19, such study helps us
to fight against the transformation from a conventional to a digital way of learning and suggest
that educators & learners must be ready to adopt new changes and requirement of the present
situation.
