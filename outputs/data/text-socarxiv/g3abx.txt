Abstract
Objective: We examined undergraduate students’ concerns about returning to campus and about
online learning from home.
Participants: Undergraduates majoring in STEM at US universities/colleges.
Methods: Participants completed an online survey in July 2020. We content-analyzed responses
to open-ended questions about concerns about Fall 2020.
Results: Students (N=64) were 52% women, 47% low SES, and 73% races/ethnicities other than
non-Hispanic white. Concerns about returning to campus included student noncompliance with
university COVID-19 prevention guidelines (28%), infection risk (26%), poor instructional
quality (26%), inadequate university plans for preventing/handling outbreaks (25%), negative
impacts on social interactions (11%), and transportation/commuting (11%). Concerns about
online learning from home included difficulty focusing on schoolwork (58%), lack of handson/experiential learning (24%), negative impacts on social interactions (19%), family/home
environment (15%), concerns that online learning wastes time/money (10%), and inadequate
technology/Internet access (5%).
Conclusions: Universities should address student concerns and provide resources to overcome
barriers to effective learning.

Introduction
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, colleges and universities forced many students
to relocate and transition to remote instruction in mid-March 2020. This abrupt shift to online
learning disrupted undergraduate education, raising student concerns about academic
performance, ability to graduate 1, and career opportunities 2. Across the US, many universities’
reopening plans for Fall 2020 include a campus return for a minority of students while providing
online learning for remaining students. Universities opening their campuses developed safety
policies 3 to prevent COVID-19 infections 4, yet some schools have seen COVID-19 incidence
proliferate, resulting in a shift to online learning for all 5.
For undergraduate students majoring in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics), a shift to virtual learning may be particularly disruptive as many courses involve
hands-on components difficult to recreate virtually (e.g., laboratory). Further, the pandemic has
impacted the job market for STEM majors in terms of marketable skills and employment
opportunities. An increasingly competitive and evolving job market 6,7 presents more than just
academic and financial concerns for students but also access to health insurance and other
benefits (e.g., retirement) because these depend on employment. Finally, many STEM fields do
not represent the diversity of the US 8, making these majors an important target for programming
that offsets the educational impact of the pandemic.
Understanding STEM students’ concerns about on campus and online learning during the
pandemic is imperative to planning efforts for this and future disruptions to STEM education 9.
The impact on college students is likely to intensify as the pandemic continues 10, putting an
entire cohort of students at risk for poor educational outcomes. A return to normal will require
COVID-19 vaccination rates high enough to attain herd immunity which may not be possible

until late 2021 at the soonest 11 and this timeline is threatened by high rates of COVID-19
vaccine hesitancy 12. Experts predict future pandemics and natural disasters due to factors such
as deforestation and climate change so future campus disruptions can be expected 13,14.
Universities need guidance on how to shape their plans to respond to public emergencies to
maximize the educational success of students while minimizing attrition, especially among
STEM majors from historically-excluded groups.
In this qualitative study, we examined concerns of a diverse sample of STEM
undergraduate students about both returning to campus and online learning from home during the
Fall 2020 semester. The goals of this study are to identify problems associated with on-campus
and remote online learning during the pandemic and to identify areas for future research that will
enhance our ability to meet the educational needs of STEM students.
Methods
In July 2020, we recruited undergraduate students attending US colleges/universities to
participate in a study about their experiences transitioning to online learning due to COVID-19 in
Spring 2020. Participants completed a 30-minute survey 15 and participated in a focus group
stratified by gender (women, men), socioeconomic status (SES; low, higher), and race/ethnicity
(non-Hispanic white/Middle Eastern, Hispanic/Latinx, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic
Asian). Participants received a $50 gift card. The Penn State and University of Connecticut
Institutional Review Boards approved this study.
We recruited students by posting on STEM-related subreddits and by emailing course
listservs. Faculty in the Math Alliance, a national organization of faculty in mathematics,
forwarded a recruitment email to their students and other faculty teaching calculus courses
required by many STEM majors. Interested individuals completed a brief initial eligibility

screener 15. Eligible students were aged 18 years or older, enrolled full-time in a
college/university in the United States in Spring 2020, declared or intended STEM major, and
met criteria for inclusion in one of 16 focus groups stratified by gender, SES, and race/ethnicity.
STEM majors included students who had a declared major within the natural sciences (e.g.,
biology, physics), engineering, mathematics, and technology (e.g., computer science), but
excluded students in the social sciences (e.g., psychology). Participants reported their gender as
woman, man, or with an ‘other’ write-in option; students who did not identify as women or men
were excluded. Participants reported whether they identified their ethnicity as Hispanic/Latinx,
and reported how they describe their race(s), including Native American (e.g., American Indian,
Alaskan Native, Indigenous), Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Black/African American,
White/Caucasian, Middle Eastern/Arab American, South East/East Asian (e.g., Malaysian,
Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese), or South Asian (e.g., Indian, Sri Lankan). Based on responses,
we categorized participants as non-Hispanic white/Middle Eastern, Hispanic/Latinx (any
race[s]), non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic Asian, or other race/ethnicity; participants
identifying as another race/ethnicity or as non-Hispanic multiracial were excluded from
participation. Students were categorized as low SES if they met 1+ of the following criteria: (1)
were eligible for work study or Pell grants, (2) reported that it was very hard for their family to
pay for basics (e.g., rent, heat, food), or (3) parental education of at most a high school diploma
or GED combined with a household income < $75,000. Students were categorized as higher SES
if they met all of the following criteria: (1) were not eligible for work study, (2) were not eligible
for a Pell Grant, (3) reported that it was not hard at all or somewhat hard to pay for basics, and
(4) parental education was a Bachelor’s degree or higher. Students whose responses did not place
them in either of the above groups were excluded from participation. Of the 416 respondents to

the initial eligibility screener, we invited the 154 eligible individuals to participate in genderSES-race/ethnicity focus groups (max 6 students per group). The current study reports on
students’ concerns about Fall 2020 reported by the 64 students who completed the survey.
The survey included questions assessing demographics, their situation in Spring 2020
(e.g., academic performance, courses, employment) and concerns about the Fall 2020 semester.
Participants were asked two questions about how concerned and excited they were about
returning to campus in the fall (5-point scale from not at all concern/excited to extremely
concerned/excited). Participants were then asked two open-ended questions about what concerns
they had about returning to campus and concerns about staying home and learning online in Fall
2020.
Statistical analysis
We summarized participant characteristics and Likert items about excitement and
concern using descriptive statistics. We conducted a directed content analysis 16 of the responses
to the open-ended questions related to concerns about Fall 2020. For the question on concerns
about returning to campus, one student did not provide a response and 6 students said they would
be staying home; we analyzed responses from 57 students. For the question about concerns about
online learning at home, three students left this question blank, one said they were returning to
campus, and one wrote “n/a”; we analyzed responses from 59 students. We developed a
codebook after an initial review of participant responses. Two coders (LR, VH) reviewed all
responses and coded the presence of each theme (69-98% agreement across themes). A third
researcher (MEW) reviewed discrepantly-coded responses and adjudicated. Quantitative
analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).
Results

Students (n=64) were 52% women, 47% low SES, and 73% identified as races/ethnicities
other than non-Hispanic white (Table 1). In Spring 2020, participants were enrolled in 32 US
colleges/universities, including private colleges/universities (n=4, 13% of schools), public
universities (n=27, 78%), and community colleges (n=3, 9%). When surveyed in July 2020,
students were living in 20 US states/territories including Puerto Rico, with two students living
outside the US. Six percent (n=4) of students were not all concerned about returning to campus,
25% (n=16) were slightly concerned, 23% (n=15) were somewhat concerned, 28% (n=18) were
moderately concerned, and 17% (n=11) were extremely concerned. More than a quarter (27%,
n=17) were not at all excited about returning to campus, 13% (n=8) were slightly excited, 22%
(n=14) were somewhat excited, 16% (n=10) were moderately excited, and 22% (n=14) were
extremely excited.
When asked about concerns about returning to campus in Fall 2020, 63% (n=36) of
students shared one concern, 30% (n=17) shared two concerns, 5% (n=3) shared three concerns,
and 2% (n=1) shared four concerns. The most common concern, shared by 28% (n=16) of
students, was other students’ noncompliance to university/college guidelines to prevent COVID19 infection on campus, including social distancing and mask wearing (Table 2). Some students
expressed specific concerns about roommates’ behavior while others expressed concerns about
students on-campus generally. The second most common concern, voiced by 26% (n=15) of
students, was becoming infected with COVID-19, including concerns about subsequently
infecting family members. Twenty-six percent (n=15) of students reported concerns about
instructional quality and access to resources (e.g., tutoring, library). A quarter of students (25%;
n=14) were concerned about their university’s plan for preventing COVID-19 infection,
including the university’s potential response to an outbreak and financial repercussions of

another sudden campus closing (e.g., not being refunded for housing costs). Eleven percent (n=6)
of students were concerned about the impact on their social life, including reduced opportunity to
spend time with friends and difficulty making new friends. Some students (n=6, 11%) had
concerns about transportation, specifically, the risk of COVID-19 infection on public
transportation and the cost of commuting to campus in personal vehicles. Nineteen percent
(n=11) of students voiced additional concerns (e.g., mental health, international students getting
deported; Table 2).
When asked about their concerns about learning online from home in Fall 2020, 64%
(n=38) of students shared one concern, 24% (n=14) shared two concerns, 10% (n=6) shared three
concerns, and 2% (n=1) shared four concerns. The most common concern, shared by 58% of
students (n=34), was about difficulty staying focused on schoolwork during online learning
(Table 3). The second most common concern regarding online learning at home was the absence
of hands-on/experiential learning opportunities and in-person interactions with faculty (24%,
n=14). The next most common concern was the impact of staying home on their social
connections (19%, n=11). Students were concerned about missing their friends, feeling lonely or
isolated, and having a harder time staying connected with friends. Next, students were concerned
about family and home environment barriers (e.g., distractions, no privacy) to effective learning
(15%, n=9). Ten percent (n=6) of students were concerned that online learning would be a
“waste” of time, money, or their college experience. Finally, some students (5%, n=3) were
concerned about inadequate technology or Internet connectivity. A fifth of students (19%, n=11)
voiced other concerns about learning online from home, including mental health issues, not
having enough food to eat at home, visa concerns, and needing to pay for a lease on an offcampus apartment near their university (Table 3).

Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic will continue to disrupt universities at least through 2021,
impacting two academic years for a large cohort of students. To the extent that this disruption
affects students’ health and education, the pandemic’s impact on this generation will be far
reaching. We found that students have concerns regarding both returning to campus and online
learning from home during the pandemic. These concerns relate to their physical and mental
health as well as their education. These findings can inform university policies going forward
and future research to examine how to offset these impacts.
Universities, eager to bring students back to campus, have put safety guidelines in place
and have asked students to sign pledges to adhere to those guidelines 3. Critics have suggested
that bringing students back to campus under any conditions is irresponsible not only because of
the social nature of campus life but also because of young adults’ propensity to engage in higher
rates of risk taking behaviors 17. Similarly, students in this study had concerns that other students
would flout university safety guidelines, which could put them at risk or cause campus to shut
down again. Additionally, many students expressed concern about how well their university’s
safety guidelines would protect them. Students’ skepticism about the efficacy of their
university’s safety guidelines is an indicator that they see weaknesses that leadership may have
overlooked. Universities and colleges should engage students in their safety guidelines going
forward to gauge feasibility and acceptability and to determine how to engender student
confidence in those guidelines.
Contrary to the media narrative that young adults don’t care if they get infected with
COVID-19 18, infection was a concern reported by quarter of students in this study. Their fears
have come to pass as >130,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported on college campuses as

of the beginning of October 2020 19. Many who were concerned about infection feared that
putting others at risk, including family members. Implementing policies to address public health
and safety on-campus will not be effective without considering how to ensure safety off-campus.
Universities should guide commuting students on how to do so safely, and for students residing
on campus, how to safely reenter their home environments when the semester ends to reduce the
risk of infecting family members or causing community spread 20. This will be especially
important for students from historically-excluded racial/ethnic groups and low-SES students
given the alarming disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in these communities 21,22.
The need for effective health education around COVID-19 on college campuses is highlighted by
a recent study of 1,136 undergraduate students found that only 18% of students could identify the
three major symptoms of COVID-19 and less than half of the students reported high health
literacy23. Further research should explore how students think about their risk for COVID-19,
their understanding of the risk of transmission to others, and what messages might be most
effective in reducing risk taking behavior, as universities are in dire need of effective public
health messaging around COVID-19.
Interestingly, impact on their ability to socialize with friends was a concern regarding
both returning to campus and online learning remotely because in both scenarios, social
opportunities are restricted. Although observational research shows that social media use is
associated with depression in young adults 24, during the pandemic, social media may be an
important source of social connection. The fact that students, who are generally social media
natives, crave in-person social interactions suggests that they do not view social media as a
satisfactory replacement for face-to-face interaction but rather a complement. Further research is
needed to explore how young adults can leverage social media in ways that enhance their mental

and physical health (e.g., online communities devoted to health and wellbeing) 25. Universities
should provide on-campus opportunities for safe peer interactions and increase capacity for
mental health services given the negative impacts of social isolation 26. Universities can increase
capacity for mental health services by expanding their offered services, increasing the number of
providers, reducing barriers to access, and through intentional outreach—especially to students
from underprivileged backgrounds (e.g., LGBTQ+ , students of color)27.
Students voiced many concerns related to online learning, many of which were related to
educational quality, their ability to focus and learn with the approaches used by instructors
during Spring 2020, and the lack of hands-on/experiential learning experiences (e.g., lab
courses). Universities quickly pivoted to online learning in Spring 2020 but few had planned for
this circumstance which appears to have resulted in inconsistent teaching modalities, variable
quality of implementation, elimination of experiential learning, and poor utilization of innovative
online teaching technologies 28. A common concern among students in this study was that
subsequent semesters would reflect the same lack of preparedness they experienced in the spring.
Indeed, 10% of the students in our study specifically stated that online learning would be a waste
of their time and money. To the extent that universities do not ensure that faculty are prepared
for online instruction, the perception that online learning is substandard will persist, which will
hamper efforts to increase the reach of online learning to communities that have poor access to
higher education. Many innovative technologies are available to create engaging online learning
experiences 29 and they are used regularly in institutions that have made investments in distance
learning 30,31. However, many faculty in traditional universities lack familiarity with these tools
and the skills to leverage them in their pedagogy 28. Further, active learning strategies that are
effective in STEM courses can be incorporated in online learning environments (e.g., discussion

boards for course content) 32,33. Public health experts forecast that pandemics will be increasingly
common in the coming years as will natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires 34,35 that
also have the potential to make being on or traveling to a university campus unsafe. At this point,
universities need to work toward developing a seamless plan for pivoting to online learning to
prevent poor educational outcomes, dissatisfaction, and attrition in the face of these public
emergencies 36,37.
Additional concerns about online learning from home included barriers to learning in the
home environment such as family obligations or lack of a private place to study and inadequate
Wi-Fi or computing resources. Inadequate internet access is a barrier for many low-SES students
attempting online learning 38. Currently, many opportunities to use public Wi-Fi networks are
restricted (e.g., public libraries, coffee shops) and without adequate access at home, low-SES
students may be compelled to take gap years or drop out 39,40. Additional home environment
concerns include safety issues (e.g., physical/emotional/sexual abuse, drug and/or alcohol use)
and food and housing insecurity 41,42. Universities should consider these factors when prioritizing
applications for on-campus housing. Faculty can also create flexible opportunities for course
engagement when students are participating from less private spaces, such as leveraging online
chats versus relying on oral contributions to class discussions. Future research is needed to better
understand how the home environment impacts online learning outcomes.
This study has strengths and limitations. Due to purposive sampling, the sample is
diverse with respect to race/ethnicity, gender, and SES. However, this qualitative study was not
powered to compare findings by these demographic factors. Additionally, our sample does not
include students who identify as races or ethnicities other than the four racial/ethnic groups
selected as focus group strata, including those who identify as multiracial or indigenous/Native.

Similarly, our sample does not include students whose gender identify is other than man or
woman, nor did we ask about sexual orientation. Future research is needed to investigate how
other aspects of students’ identity (e.g., sexual orientation, gender identity) impact their
experiences during the pandemic 43.
The impact of the pandemic on higher education can be considered through the lens of
the social determinants of health. Educational attainment is associated with income and
employment which are strong predictors of life expectancy 44. The US divestment in education
and public health has set the stage for the COVID-19 pandemic to have devastating impacts on
both 45. Public health research is needed to examine the impact on the current generation of
college students and develop programs to prevent attrition and facilitate reentry while providing
adequate support to address physical and mental health impacts.

16 (28) “My college has a lot of students, making social
campus COVID-19
distancing very difficult. I also don't trust my peers
prevention guidelines
to all be cautious and take the adequate preventative
measures to slow covid. Some issues are very
political, like mask wearing, and I can see how some
people might not change their views. This will
impact our efforts as a collective.”
“I'm not sure I trust other students to take the
necessary precautions to stop the spread of the
virus.”

Becoming infected with
COVID-19, including
subsequently infecting
family members

“There being a huge spread of the virus due to young
people not wanting to wear masks.”
“I really don't want to contract the virus and have
that impact my studies.”
“…that I might catch COVID from them, and as an
immunocompromised individual, that could be
deadly for me.”
“I am concerned that there will be an outbreak and as
a result, we will have to go home and potentially
affect our families who may not survive COVID19.”

Poor quality of online or
hybrid courses, lack of
hands-on/experiential
learning opportunity, and
inadequate access to
campus resources and
facilities

Inadequate university plans
to prevent an outbreak and
financial repercussions of
sudden campus closing

14 (25)

“As someone who has various family members who
are vulnerable like infants and elderly, I wouldn't
want their health to be in jeopardy because of me.”
“My school said 'most' Fall courses will be online,
but hasn't clarified which ones. All of the courses I
still need to qualify for transfer to a [UNIVERSITY
OF STATE], are supposed to have physical lab
experiments because we NEED that experience. Now
we will not get the same experience.”
“Inadequate access to facilities whether it be tutoring
centers or the gym”
“That we are going to get sent back home after they
receive tuition payments.”
“I feel like campuses are jumping the gun by opening
back up. I predict that [UNIVERSITY’S] 'hybrid'

spike in COVID cases.”
“Everything shutting back down, campus/social life
inhibited, organizations formatted differently.”
“Will not be able to see friends and make new
friends.”
“There is limited housing, so I'll probably have to
stay home and commute, but my car right now is
broken down. Also, we don't know how parking
passes will be sold or if there will even be enough.”
“I rely on public transportation to get to school, but
we have been informed that less buses will be
running and with a smaller capacity. I am concerned
of not being able to make it on time, or getting there
too early and having nowhere to wait since they are
not allowing students in the hallways of my
academic building.”
“In-person classes getting canceled would mean my
international friends get deported.”

“As an RA I can't opt out of going back otherwise I'll
have to resign my position.”

learning as much as I did when they were in person.”
“I think that the lack of hands-on experience will be a
deterrent to the learning process.”
“Lack of real life instruction and help.”

11 (19)

“I am concerned that I will be missing out on meeting new
people and networking within the major I would like to
switch to, and therefore missing out on opportunities. I am
worried that I will no longer have friends to go back due to
the fact that I am not returning but others in my group are.”
“Will be lonely and unhealthy at home.”
“Lack of social interaction.”
“In regards to staying at home with my parents, it is an
option, and my biggest concern is that I will not be able to
focus 100% on schoolwork, as my parents need help with
stuff around the house, and my siblings are needy in regards
to attention. So I believe that my schoolwork will suffer
greatly if I stay at home.”
“The environment of my house living with 7 other people
makes it hard to focus.”

Distance learning
will be a waste of
time, money, or their
college experience

“My ability to work efficiently while in my home full of
distractions like video games.”
“I think the price that I am paying to be here is not reflected
in the education I am receiving online. I do not want to be
ripped off because I am paying so much for so little.”
“Waste of time and money losing fun senior year with
friends.”
