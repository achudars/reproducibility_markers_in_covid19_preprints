Working Paper: The Impact of COVID-19 Mask
Mandates on Consumer Spending
By Prosser Cathey
The debate around the effects of the imposition of COVID-19 mask
mandates has been fervent, however, little research has been done
on the economic effects of these mandates. I find that mask mandates have a positive average treatment effect of 3% on consumer
spending. I then use survey data to confirm the mechanism: people
tend to feel more comfortable participating in the economy when
mask-wearing is common. Finally, I provide an estimate of the
increase in tax revenue state and local governments can expect to
receive as a result of implementing a mask mandate, finding a mask
mandate can offset a substantial portion of the pandemic-induced
decline in tax revenue.
I.

Introduction

Over the course of the pandemic, health officials and medical experts have
consistently identified wide-spread mask wearing as a key mechanism through
which we can slow the spread of the virus (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020). This has naturally led governments to ask the question ‚ÄúShould
mask-wearing be required?‚Äù In attempting to answer this question, much of the
public debate has been centered around the trade-off between personal liberties
and public health. Some argue that a mask mandate is an unacceptable and
unconstitutional encroachment on personal freedoms, while others argue it is a
practical and necessary step to save lives. I offer no endorsement of either side
of this increasingly partisan divide, but rather seek to shed some light on a part
of this debate which has been relatively under-studied and under-discussed: the
economic implications of a mask mandate.
I ask the question ‚ÄúHow do mask mandates affect consumer spending?‚Äù and
use the variation from staggered policy implementation to answer it. I use a fixed
effects approach estimate mask mandates result in a 3.2% increase in consumer
spending. I then visualize and examine how this effect changes over time via
an event study. I find survey data backs up my mechanism hypothesis that
people feel more comfortable going out and spending money when mask usage is
common place; 88% of survey respondents indicate that others wearing masks is
an important consideration when deciding whether to leave their home. Finally,

The Impact of COVID-19 Mask Mandates on Consumer Spending

I use my results to calculate the tax revenue state and local governments can
expect to receive from implementing a mask mandate. On average, states with a
sales tax can expect a 1.1% increase in their tax revenue, which correlates to an
approximately $200 million increase in tax revenue.
My paper contributes to a broader literature on the effects of mask mandates,
which almost exclusively focuses on the public health effects. Notable among the
studies that focus on the public health implications of a mask mandate is Lyu and
Wehby (2020), a similar approach to that which I use. Lyu and Wehby (2020)
use an event study design to look at the effects of state-level mask mandates on
COVID-19 infection rates. Also of relevance is Hansen (2020), in which Goldman
Sachs analysts claim that mask mandates could save the U.S. up to $1 trillion
due to mask mandates saving lives and improving public health. I distinguish my
work from that of Goldman Sachs by focusing on the direct implications of mask
mandates on the economy rather than the indirect effect of mask mandates‚Äô effect
on lives saved, which in turn impacts the economy. To the best of my knowledge,
I am the first to directly link COVID-19 mask mandates and economic outcomes.
II.

Background Information and Description of Data

Mask mandates have become a widely used tool in fighting the spread of
COVID-19, but have garnered much debate. Since the consensus among public
health experts is that wide spread mask usage reduces COVID-19 transmission,
many governments have taken steps to encourage people to wear masks when interacting with others. These steps have ranged from recommendations and advice
to strict requirements with penalties for non-compliance. In the United States,
many of these mandates have been surrounded by an increasingly partisan debate
over the trade-off between public health and personal freedom.
In order to make a causal claim, the variation in timing of mask mandate implementations must exogenous and driven by factors unrelated to economic outcomes; I believe it to be so for three reasons. Firstly, the timing of these mandates
varies widely; with state and local governments implementing mask mandates as
early as March 16th and as late as August 5th . Additionally, mask mandates are
not clustered around a certain date. For example, if a high proportion of counties
imposed mask mandates on June 1st , then it would be reasonable to suggest that
something else happened on June 1st which was driving the increase in consumer
spending. However, I show in Figures 2 and 3 that the timing of mask mandates
is distributed fairly evenly throughout the course of the pandemic. Qualitatively,
to the best of my knowledge, there is no outside pressure driving the implementation of mask mandates by state and local governments. Rather, their adoptions
seems to be driven by the idiosyncrasies of different governmental procedures and
local politics. This is supported by the timing of other public policies, such as
stay at home orders or restaurant closings, which similarly seem to be not only
uncorrelated with anything in particular but also uncorrelated with each other.
Note also that assuming exogeneity is consistent with the literature on COVID-19

government responses, see Lin and Meissner (2020) for one example.
I acquire the data necessary to perform my analysis from a number of sources.
I use the data that Wright et. al (2020) compile on tracking mask mandates by
county. It consists of each U.S. county and the mask mandates implemented,
whether by state or local governments. In counties which are primarily made up
of a city, city-wide ordinances were viewed as applicable to the county. Throughout the paper, I use Opportunity Insight‚Äôs panel data on consumer spending by
county. It reports the seven-day moving average of seasonally adjusted credit/debit
card spending relative to January 4-31, 2020, in all merchant category codes from
February 1st to August 30th . I merge these two data-sets by county and date,
leaving a data-set of 354,046 total daily observations for 1,670 counties. This is
the data on which I perform my analysis. To add covariates for population and
political affiliation, I use data-sets from the United States Department of Agriculture and the MIT Election Lab, respectively. The United States Department
of Agriculture codes each county on an urban to rural continuum. MIT Election
Data reports the percentage of votes each Presidential candidate received in 2016.
I use Killeen et. al (2020) to source state-level data on the reopening of the economy; I find there to be minimal temporal connection between the re-openings and
mask mandates. I also use Killeen et. al (2020)‚Äôs data which reports the number
of new COVID-19 cases per county per day.
To further investigate my proposed mechanism, I conduct a survey. I use Prolific to ask United States residents the question ‚ÄúWhen deciding whether or not
to leave your home for non-essential tasks, how important is it to you that others wear masks?‚Äù. Respondents indicate their answers on a 1-7 scale. I collect
responses from 57 participants.
III.

Empirical Design
A.

Fixed Effects

To estimate mask mandates‚Äô effect on consumer spending, I use a fixed effects
approach. This produces an estimate of the average difference in consumer spending between those countries with mask mandates and those without, across all
time periods. I limit my analysis to between 50 days before mandate implementation and 125 days after mandate implementation. I choose 125 as the upper
bound because beyond this point data quality deteriorates. I choose ‚àí50 as the
lower bound because this is the point at which consumer spending stabilizes. Before ‚àí50, I see a ‚Äúv-shape‚Äù, most likely the result of the onset of the pandemic.
While this is the maximum reasonable time-frame given the data, as shown in
Section IV, my results also hold for shorter time-frames as well. Appendix D
presents the full range of data I have. The stylized version of the regression is

where CS is consumer spending in a given county at a given time, Treated is
a dummy for experiencing a mask mandate, Cases is the number of confirmed
cases, Deaths is the number of confirmed deaths, NPI is a vector of dummies
for non-pharmaceutical interventions, and Œ≥c is a vector of county fixed effects.
The non-pharmaceutical interventions I was able to obtain data for were stay at
home orders, in-person restaurant bans, gym & entertainment bans, 50 person
gathering bans, and 500 person gathering bans. I include COVID-19 cases and
deaths in my regression because they are likely to be causally linked to mask
mandates and economic activity. However, as shown in my robustness check in
Appendix A, they only slightly affect my estimate. To determine a causal effect,
I need the following assumption to hold: the error term must be independent of
treatment, conditional on the controls. To put this into words, mask mandates
must not have been given to places on differential trends.
B.

Event Study

To visualize the effect of mask mandates on consumer spending and measure
how that effect varies relative to the treatment date, I use an event study approach. I use the day before treatment (coded as ‚àí1) as the reference date and
again limit the time period to between 50 days before mandate implementation
and 125 days after mandate implementation. I run the regression
(2)

where, as before, CS is consumer spending in a given county at a given time, Cases
is the number of confirmed cases, Deaths is the number of confirmed deaths, NPI
is a vector of dummies for non-pharmaceutical interventions, and Œ≥c is a vector
of county fixed effects. As above, the non-pharmaceutical interventions I include
were stay at home orders, in-person restaurant bans, gym & entertainment bans,
50 person gathering bans, and 500 person gathering bans. The main coefficients
of interest are Œ¥t .

Results

Main Results

Using a fixed effects approach, I find mask mandates increase consumer spending by 3.2%. The effect is precise, with standard errors clustered at the county
level being .2%. I present the regression table, along with robustness checks,
in Table A. For scale, so far this year consumer spending has been down 8.8%
compared to pre-pandemic levels, on average. This indicates that in pandemic
conditions, local mask mandates tend to result in substantial increases in consumer spending.

I plot the estimated coefficients Œ¥ÃÇt from my event study in Figure 1 to capture how consumer spending jumps after mask mandate implementation. The
pre-treatment period shows no clear trend, appearing to be generally constant.
Immediately upon treatment, there is a noticeable trend: for the first approximately 65 days post treatment the estimates consistently increase. At treatment,
there is also a significant jump in the estimate. The estimates are statistically
significantly different from the reference date (day ‚àí1) at the 90% level starting
at day 1, the 95% level starting at day 2, and the 99.9% level starting at day
3. The slight lag is likely affected by the fact that my dependent variable, consumer spending is a seven-day moving average. After the initial upwards trend
immediately post treatment, consumer spending stabilizes, maintaining its significance and increasing only slightly through the duration of the post-treatment
time period.
B.

Potential Threats

I now examine various potential threats to causality. I find no evidence that
there exists a variable which varies along with mask mandates and increases consumer spending. The primary candidate would be other policy interventions induced by COVID-19, such as re-openings of gyms and restaurants or the ending of
stay at home orders. As Table A shows, controlling for non-pharmaceutical interventions does decrease the magnitude of my estimate, but my estimate maintains
its statistical significance. In Appendix E, I present the distribution of the timing
of policies concerning 50-person gatherings, 500-person gatherings, restaurants,
gyms and stay at home orders, relative to mask mandate implementation dates. I
find little temporal correlation between mask mandates and non-pharmaceutical
interventions. I formally test the effect of all non-mask mandate NPIs in an event
study presented in Figure E6. When looking at a dummy variable for the existence of any non-mask mandate NPI, there is no statistically significant change
correlating with the implementation of mask mandates. I also include the number
of COVID-19 cases and deaths as covariates in Regression 1 since mask mandates
have the potential to be correlated with cases and deaths, both of which likely
decrease consumer spending. As shown in Table A, I found that including cases
and deaths in my analysis results in a slightly higher and roughly equally precise
estimate for the coefficient of interest.
I explore the possibility that pre-treatment trends indicate there would have
been an increase in consumer spending. Figure D1 shows median consumer spending is roughly constant for a period of 50 days prior to the treatment date. Additionally, after 50 days of roughly constant consumer spending, there is a significant, permanent increase just three days after treatment despite the fact that
consumer spending is measured via a seven day moving average. Therefore I do
not consider pre-treatment trends to indicate that consumer spending would have
increased as much as the observed increase.
Though mandate implementation primarily occurs at the local level, a non-

negligible amount of mask mandates come from state government. To account
for this, I rerun my regressions, clustering my standard errors at the state level.
The results are approximately the same.
Thus far, I have performed analysis on the maximum reasonable timeline given
the data, however, if mask mandates really do have a causal effect on consumer
spending then then ideally the effect is significant for shorter time-frames as well.
I repeat my analysis, running Regression 1 again on the subset of data within 31
days of the mandate and within 7 days of the mandate. Both regressions produce
significant results: 2.3% with standard errors of 0.002% and 1.6% with standard
errors of 0.002%, respectively.
I perform robustness checks, re-running Regression 1 with various covariates.
The results are presented in Table A. Consistent with my causal claim, mask
mandates have a significant effect in all regressions run. Also of note, adding
covariates for the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions (stay at home orders,
bans on 50 person gatherings, et cetera) did decrease the value of my estimate,
but not enough to threaten my claim of causality.
Due to the elimination of the above potential threats to causality, I provisionally
consider the results of my analysis to carry causal implications.
C.

Mechanism

I view the most likely mechanism by which mask mandates affect consumer
spending as the following: mask mandates result in more people wearing masks;
more people wearing masks results in people feeling safer leaving their home; and
people feeling safer leaving their house results in them spending more money. I
conduct a survey via Prolific, with a sample size of 50 taken from United States
residents. I find my survey data is consistent with this mechanism; 72% of respondents indicate that others‚Äô mask wearing was a very important indicator in
deciding whether to leave their home. Furthermore, 87.7% respond in the 5-7
range, where responses were given on a 7 point scale where 1 is ‚Äúnot important
at all‚Äù and 7 is ‚Äúvery important.‚Äù
At first my proposed mechanism seems to imply there should only be a discrete
jump around the treatment cutoff, not necessarily a change in slope. However,
a change in slope is, in fact, consistent with many individuals experiencing a
delayed version of my mechanism. For example, if it was necessary for someone
to see for themselves that mask wearing is now frequent, then whenever they
see this is when they would spend their money, as opposed to immediately posttreatment. Alternatively, suppose that, in order to venture out, another person
needs the assurance of a family member who can verify that mask wearing is high
and shopping is safe. Then they would not only have to wait until that family
member was sufficiently convinced but also until they had the chance to discuss
the situation with them. In these ways, a feeling of slightly increased safety due
to the heightened level of mask wearing that mask mandates induce could spread
through the population in the days and weeks immediately after implementation.

Heterogeneity

I find slight evidence that treatment effects are heterogeneous over time. I
divide the data in half, using the middle date for my data: (May 16th ). I rerun
Regression 1 for both the first half and second half. As shown in Table C1,
both time periods produce statistically significant estimates for the effect of mask
mandates on consumer spending. Note, however, that the magnitude varies by
time period; I estimate a 5.0% (.006) increase in consumer spending for the first
half and a 2.3% (.002) increase for the second half. I theorize that, as the pandemic
progressed, mask wearing became more common even in areas without a mandate
and businesses became more likely to implement their own requirements. As such,
the effect of a mandate on mask wearing decreases as time went on.
I now examine heterogeneity over groups. I first examine population density,
as the effect of a mask mandate could be different in cities than in rural areas
since frequent close contact with other people could result in greater desire to
wear a mask. I use the urban-rural codes developed by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture that score each county on a scale of 1 to 9, with 1 being the most urban and 9 being the most rural. As shown in Table C2, mask mandates maintain
their statistically significant effect on consumer spending in all population densities. Additionally, the interaction term is negative and statistically significant at
the 95% level, suggesting that mask mandates have a larger effect on consumer
spending in urban areas than rural ones. This is consistent with my proposed
mechanism; people who regularly come in close contact with others would care
more about others wearing a mask than a person who rarely comes into close
contact with others.
I also examine heterogeneity across political affiliation, as measured by Democratic vote share in the 2016 election. As with population density, mask mandates
appear to maintain their significant effect on consumer spending across all vote
shares. Additionally, the interaction term is significant at the 99% level, indicating that mask mandates have a larger effect on consumer spending in more
Democratic counties. An explanation for this that is consistent with my proposed
mechanism is that those who identify as Republican may be more likely to ignore
government mandates. This would result in less people wearing masks, making
people less comfortable leaving their homes and spending money.
Finally, I examine heterogeneity across COVID-19 intensity, presenting my results in Table C2. I use COVID-19 deaths as a proxy for the intensity of the
pandemic, though using cases gives roughly the same results. I find that the
interaction term is not statistically significant, indicating that the effect of mask
mandates on consumer spending does not vary with the intensity of the pandemic. This contradicts my proposed mechanism, since the mechanism would
predict that the effect of mask mandates on consumer spending is more salient in
areas where the pandemic is more intense. More research needs to be done into
my proposed mechanism to reconcile this apparent contradiction.

Implications

I now focus on the policy applications of my findings. Since an increase in
consumer spending is not perfectly correlated with state sales tax revenue, my
calculations should be viewed as upper bounds rather than point estimates. While
my analysis was done on the county level since that was where treatment time
varied, I present policy implications at the state level because that is the level of
government which most commonly taxes consumer spending directly. Since the
average state receives 23.1% of their tax revenue from consumer spending, a 3.1%
increase in consumer spending could produce a substantial increase in a state‚Äôs
overall tax revenue (Federation of Tax Administrators). The sources of states‚Äô
tax revenue vary significantly, so the expected amount gained as a result of a
mask mandate is presented on a per state basis in Table B1. Averaging across
states that have a sales tax, mask mandates can be expected to increase state tax
revenue by 1.1%. The maximum expected increase is in Florida at 2.06%, while
the lowest expected increase is in the few states that don‚Äôt have a sales tax. Using
the same approach gives an estimate for an average absolute increase in revenue
of $202, 518, 629.
V.

Conclusion

In summary, I use a fixed effects approach at the United States county level
to find the average treatment effect of a mask mandate on consumer spending.
I complement this by using an event study approach to visualize and measure
how the effect varies over time. I use survey data to confirm the mechanism that
people do, in fact, tend to feel more comfortable participating in the economy
when mask-wearing is common. I provisionally assume causality given the analysis
currently conducted. Based on my results, I conclude that governments in areas
where people are concerned about catching COVID-19 can expect to see an uptick
in consumer spending of on average 3.2%, if they implement a mask mandate.
Likewise, states with a sales tax can expect to see a 1.1% increase in tax revenue,
on average, which corresponds to an approximately $200 million absolute increase.

Notes: Here I calculate the average percent increase in tax revenue each state could expect from implementing a mask mandate. This is obtained by using my estimate for the average effect of mask mandates
on consumer spending and assuming that consumer spending directly correlates to an increase in sales
tax revenue. I have excluded states without a sales tax. The variance in percent increases reflects the
variance in state tax revenue sources.

Notes: Here I explore how the effect of mask mandates on consumer spending has changed with time.
I rerun Regression 1 for the first half and second half of my data. I used the middle date of my data,
May 16th as the cutoff date. My estimate for the effect of mask mandates on consumer spending remains
statistically significantly positive in both halves, but decreases in magnitude in the second half. This is
consistent with my proposed mechanism; as the pandemic has gone on mask-wearing has become more
common regardless of the implementation of mandates.

Notes: Here I explore how the effect of mask mandates on consumer spending changes with population
and political affiliation. I rerun Regression including interaction terms for population density and Democratic vote share. My estimate for the effect of mask mandates on consumer spending remains significant
across all levels of population density and political affiliation. I find mask mandates have a statistically
significantly larger effect on consumer spending in urban areas than rural ones. This is consistent with
my proposed mechanism; people who regularly come in close contact with others would care more about
others wearing a mask than a person who rarely comes into close contact with others. My results also
indicate that mask mandates have a significantly larger effect on consumer spending in counties that are
more Democratic. An explanation for this that is consistent with my proposed mechanism is that those
who identify as Republican may be more likely to ignore government mandates. This would result in less
people wearing masks, making people less comfortable leaving their homes and spending money.

Figure D1. This figure presents the full extent of data on consumer spending compared to
mask mandate implementation dates. My analysis did not exceed the [‚àí50, 125] interval. I
limited my analysis to after day ‚àí50 because this is approximately the day at which the vshaped trend in consumer spending ends. I limited my analysis to before day 125 because data
quality appears to deteriorate at this point.
