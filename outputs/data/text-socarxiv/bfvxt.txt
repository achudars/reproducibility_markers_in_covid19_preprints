Abstract
Since death rates from the COVID-19 are highest among the oldest, the impact of the current
pandemic in a given society depends to a large extent on the share of elderly persons and their
living arrangements. Whereas the former is well known, the latter is not. Arguably, contagion
itself and the severity of its symptoms are likely to vary among elderly persons living alone,
co-residing with family members or dwelling in institutions. Arguments in favour and against
the premise that single-living elderly are better able to self-isolate can be made. Long-term
care facilities have worsened the effects of the epidemic because they have often become
death traps in some but not all countries. Once contagion takes place, living arrangements can
make a huge difference in the way the disease can be managed by the individual, his family
and society. Properly understanding the dynamics of contagion and the handling of the
disease in terms of living arrangements of elderly people is essential for effectively tackling
future outbreaks of similar epidemics.

The COVID-19 pandemic in an aging world
The epidemic becomes a pandemic
The COVID-19 epidemic began in China but has spread rapidly to much of the world. It has
become the most relevant health issue in many decades, with poorly known contagion levels
(due to lack of adequate testing) and currently 83,476 deaths (20-04-08).1 Considering the
lack of representative studies using antibodies, currently our best “guestimate” of its basic
characteristics suggests that there is an important percentage of asymptomatic contagions
(approximately 30%), a high percentage (55%) with mild to moderate symptoms, about 10%
of contagions with severe symptoms requiring hospitalization and about 5% of all contagions
requiring intensive care and ventilation (Razai, et al. 2020). Deaths from COVID-19
correspond to these last two categories. A key characteristic of this virus is its ability to
spread undetected, efficiently and quickly, ultimately thwarting the efforts of authorities to
afford reliable estimates of its spread. It has put public health systems to a severe test and
often overwhelmed their ability to manage the avalanche of severe cases acceptably well.
One of the main characteristics of COVID-19 is that it is especially widespread and lethal
among elderly persons, in particularly those beyond 70 years of age. In the initial phase of the
epidemic when it was restricted for the most part to China, death rates were 11.4 times higher
among those 80+ than they were for people 50-59.2 This age structure of death rates among
confirmed cases has been corroborated recently for the COVID-19 epidemic in Spain, Italy
and France.3 Death rates tend to be higher among men and among people with co-morbidities.
However, the asymptomatic onset of the virus together with the nearly unknown proportion of
asymptomatic cases, makes it nearly impossible to register contagion and its relation to age
reliably. Notwithstanding, the key challenge of the COVID-19 epidemic for health systems is
related to the rate at which people needing different types of intensive care bunch together,
quickly overwhelming available hospital beds or the supply of respirators, for example.
COVID-19 constitutes the most important challenge for health care systems in recent
memory, with often-disappointing results.

The societal contexts of the pandemic
Here a crucial determining factor will be the relative size of the elderly population and the
extent to which they are exposed to contagion. From a demographic standpoint, we find
substantial differences in the share of the population that is aged 65+ across developed and
developing countries but also substantial differences among the developed nations. These
demographic contrasts together with differences in the living arrangements and solutions for
the care of the frailest elderly are crucial factors in calibrating the gravity of the COVID-19
epidemic and the ability of different societies to combat it successfully. In this text we will
address some potential implications of these demographic contrasts, primarily within the

developed world, and how they affect different societies potential to cope with the current
epidemic.
In recent decades, there have been important shifts around the world linked to population
aging and to the position of the elderly in society that have significant implications for the
way COVID-19 affects society. Briefly stated, these are:


Over the past half century in the most developed world, and more recently in the
developing world, there has been an important process of societal aging that has led to
an increase in the proportion and the actual number of elderly in society. In countries
where this process is more advanced, the relative weight of the elderly is highlighted
by far faster population growth rates among the oldest age groups (>80 or higher) than
in other age ranges normally considered to be elderly as well (say, 60-69). This shift in
population age structures has fuelled fears for the stability of all forms of well-being
based on intergenerational transfers of goods and services; specifically, here, health
care systems. Within this general situation, the faster growth rates of the highest age
groups have posed a wide array of challenges ranging from people’s ability to save for
the final stages of their own lives to the actual number of people with given healthrelated issues. The age of aging is a worldwide phenomenon that is unquestionably
most advanced in highly developed societies with long-standing levels of very low
fertility, including a number of developed East Asian nations (Taiwan, South Korea,
Singapore, Japan). In much of the developing world, this an issue for the future, but in
some highly developed countries it is very much an issue of the present. The timing of
major shifts in fertility in the recent past explain disparities in the timing of these
processes (Reher, 2015).



Associated with the general process of societal aging, there has been an important
growth in the proportion of elderly living on their own.4 There are multiple causes for
this shift, including the incidence of divorce, differential life expectancy by sex during
mid- and late-life, the out-migration of younger family members, the desirability of
living alone and people’s ability to do so, the availability of other options for
coresidence in later life, including living with offspring and kin, or in institutional
contexts. As a result of all of these factors, at present percentages of living alone have
reached extremely high levels, as high as 50% or more among women (aged 75-79)
and 20-30% among men. Levels are by far the highest in the most developed nations
of the world, but there is some indication that they are on the rise everywhere (Esteve
et al, 2020). Recent research has also shown a sharp growth in the proportion living
alone in later life although, in some countries where it peaked relatively early (Nordic
countries, the UK, the USA), there has been a moderate decline in these rates over the
past 20 years, though not in the actual number of elderly living alone (Reher and
Requena, 2019). Even so, rates for women above 65 who live alone in many countries
continue to be well in excess of 30-35%.5 In sum, in the developed world, living alone
represents an important component in people’s residential options as they age.



An important characteristic of aging societies is the increasing importance of
institutional living arrangements for people during later life. In some countries, these

Recent UN data show that living alone (both sexes) among people aged 60 and over is often in excess of 20 or
even 30%. See: UN-DESA (2017): annex 3.

arrangements are public while in others they are the result of private initiative.
Everywhere, they constitute the third option for people as they age, situated alongside
living with others (mainly with spouses or other kin) and, of course, living alone. For
the EU, official country-level data for 2011 show that between 2-25% of peopled aged
85+ live in institutional households (Eurostat 2015). The importance of this residential
option has grown in recent years.

Implications
These structural characteristics of the aging process in the developed world have important
implications for the COVID-19 epidemic and the way it has developed to date.
Holding other factors constant in the detection and the management of the epidemic, this
means that the importance of the epidemic will tend to be higher in societies where the weight
of the elderly is highest (Kashnitsky and Aburto, 2020; Dudel et al, 2020; Dowd et al. 2020).
This effect is multiplied by the prevalence of co-morbidities that will also tend to be higher
among the oldest. Finally, despite the fact that relatively little is known about the rate of
contagion among people of different ages, the total death rate in different contexts will be
highly dependent on: (1) Population age structure (the share of total population older than 70
that experience much higher deaths rates than younger individuals, and (2) The proportion of
the population 70+ exposed to contagion. The extent to which 70+ can be shielded from
contagion will have a strong influence on the number of deaths, though inadequate testing
currently makes it impossible to understand the age/contagion trade off properly. At the very
least, however, we know that rates of contagion are likely to be high among the oldest old but
their symptoms will be far more serious, ultimately leading to higher death rates among them.
When these age groups represent a relatively higher percentage of the total population at risk,
death rates should be correspondingly higher.
Another potentially important demographic factor related to aging and influencing the impact
of COVID-19 in different societies are differences in household structure and living
arrangements. The importance of people living alone, especially in later life, has grown
enormously and will have important implications for the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic.
Research on the links between contagion and residential status with respect to the COVID-19
epidemic is sorely lacking at this stage. Whether or not elderly living on their own are more or
less likely to become infected is a matter of conjecture and theoretical arguments can be given
both in favour and against. It is well known that the baseline health of elderly people living
alone tends to be higher than it is for those living with others, mostly because during old age
prior health is a pre-requisite for living alone (Reher and Requena, 2020). Moreover, at least
in theory, individuals living alone have greater opportunities to self-isolate and this could
potentially reduce their rates of COVID-19 contagion. The problem is that total self-isolation
is virtually impossible, especially among the oldest old. This is especially relevant for those
who must rely on outside support for supplies (including medication for chronic illness),
medical attention and social contact (Priest, 2020). Where kin are available for this support, it
will reduce the need of single elderly to expose themselves to contagion at pharmacies,
grocery shops etc. but may, in fact, be a source of contagion. Conversely, it is also true that
living alone might have only a short-run positive health effect that could give way to long-run
negative effects if isolation persists over time and leads to a meaningful decrease in social
contacts and support.
In the long run, individuals living with spouses are likely to be better placed both for shortrun and for long-run health and wellbeing and, conversely, individuals living in
4

multigenerational families –and certainly those in institutions- are the most poorly positioned,
at least in times of epidemic disease (Requena and Reher, 2020; Frisch and Simonsen, 2013;
Koskinen et al, 2007). Elderly individuals in living arrangements that expose them to
contagion, either from younger household members or staff at institutions, are likely to
constitute a highly vulnerable group. The studies linking residential status and the likelihood
of death cited above, as interesting as they are, do not deal with highly contagious
environments as much as they do with chronic disease and other causes of death. There is
much to be done on the links between residential status and health, both in times of epidemic
disease and otherwise.
After contagion, the presence of a co-resident at home, especially when it involves a spouse,
becomes a vital part care and is especially relevant for any decision as to whether or not a
person is taken to an intensive care facility or, conversely, is moved into a nursing home or to
some other form of group quarters. This is mostly the case when initial symptoms do not
require immediate assisted ventilation or other specialized care. Here, living with another
person(s) offers the (at least theoretical) possibility of weathering the epidemic at home. It
also facilitates the communication of the health situation to local health authorities.
Considering the enormous problems affecting many intensive care units that have
characterized much of this epidemic, staying at home may have long-run beneficial effects, at
least in some situations. People living alone do not have this sort of in-house buffer for
decisions regarding treatment. From a slightly different perspective, this means that living
alone among the elderly by definition removes obstacles to their hospitalization and intensive
care in case of serious contagion and this contributes to the stress on, and potential collapse
of, health care systems during the peak period of any epidemic. In sum, living alone tends to
make managing the disease (or the epidemic) more difficult for the infected individual, for his
family and for society.
Institutional living represents an intermediate residential strategy whose importance in
developed countries has increased substantially because it is a middle, non-family option for
co-residence. In many countries, and especially in Italy and in Spain, these residences have
become veritable death traps for elderly residents because they have often propagated the
contagion without the adequate means of taking care of seriously ill residents. Recently,
similar problems have arisen in Sweden where the Public Health Agency
[Folkhälsomyndigheten] suspects that this has been caused be the asymptomatic spread of
contagion from staff to residents. In Stockholm, currently the epicentre of the epidemic in
Sweden, one third of all nursing homes have been affected by contagion. In a country such as
Sweden that has a relatively large proportion of the oldest-old in institutional care, the
asymptomatic spread of the disease among care staff and a lack of protective equipment might
prove to be a massive challenge to the COVID-19 response and a source of high mortality
among the oldest-old (Löfvenberg, J. 2020, April 1). The baseline health of individuals
entering long-term care facilities is poor by definition and everywhere, when inappropriately
isolated, they have proven to be a source of effective propagation of infection and seldom
have they been in a place with the capacity to handle massive experiences of contagion.
Equally important, rest homes themselves appear to have often been a de facto hindrance for
the ability of seriously ill patients to move into ICUs at large hospitals, themselves swamped
by desperate demand.
Innovative research on these issues is necessary if we are to understand the spread of the
Covid-19 epidemic properly. The key question involves linking contagion and the ultimate
outcome of the illness to the social and economic characteristics of people and, specifically, to
5

the precise co-residential situation of people and their interactions with others outside the coresidential unit before, during and after the epidemic. This type of research will not only
clarify the precise paths taken by the epidemic itself, but will also help us identify more
precisely the truly vulnerable groups in society and, ultimately, implement the policies most
likely to limit the spread of illness. Representative retrospective surveys of epidemic
survivors and of the family members of those who died offer a potential vehicle for this type
of research.

Brief conclusions
We can expect that population aging, high levels of single living during old age and
widespread living in overcrowded and understaffed communal residences will tend to make
the social, health and demographic effects of the COVID-19 worse, though empirical proof of
this, of course, continues to be essential. This explains, in part, the fact that to date the impact
of the epidemic appears to be highest in the densely populated developed world, especially in
those countries where aging is most advanced, single living during old age is a relevant
residential option, and institutional communal residences are widespread. These effects may
be enhanced by the existence of relatively close-knit family systems in many parts of the
developed world that provide the type of on-going contact that could contribute to the spread
of contagion (Reher, 1998; 2019). These characteristics of society were present long before
the explosion of the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to be relevant after the worst
stage is past.
